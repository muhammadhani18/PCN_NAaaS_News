0,PM disapproves of Imran’s IMF letter,"Kakar notes that in tangible terms, letter would have no effects, but it would have political costs for PTI","Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar has expressed his disapproval of PTI chief Imran Khan’s letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), terming this move as 'highly irresponsible'.

Appearing on a talk show of a private TV channel, the prime minister said the letter was sent at a time when the caretaker government had significantly worked for economic revival, with relevant indicators showing positive trends and achieving various financial targets.

He mentioned that negotiations with the IMF are underway for a $6-billion-dollar agreement, which is crucial for the economic health of the country. Moreover, different multilateral agreements also depend on it.

He said that there are appropriate forums for electoral disputes, and PTI’s decision to write a letter to the IMF was unjustified and highly irresponsible. However, he noted that in tangible terms, the letter would have no effects, but it would have political costs for the PTI.

Responding to a question, Kakar stated that he had appeared before the Islamabad High Court in the Baloch missing persons’ case to demonstrate that the interim set-up was functioning under a constitutional order. “Court orders should be respected, and I appeared before it to reiterate the same stance and set a precedent,” he added.

1,SC nears conclusion on Bhutto verdict,Asks parties to conclude argument at the next hearing on Monday,"The Supreme Court is expected to conclude its proceedings on a presidential reference seeking a review of the SC’s 1979 verdict in the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto case by next Monday.

A nine-member larger bench, led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa, resumed hearing the reference on Wednesday and deliberated on various aspects of the Bhutto case for over six hours.

The Lahore High Court (LHC) had sentenced former prime minister Bhutto to death on March 18, 1978, for ordering the assassination of Ahmed Reza Kasuri, one of the founding members of the PPP.
The Supreme Court, with a majority vote of 4 to 3, upheld the LHC verdict on February 6, 1979. The PPP founder was executed on April 4 of the same year.

During the PPP’s last rule between 2008 and 2013, former president Asif Ali Zardari sent the reference to the apex court, requesting an opinion after analyzing the SC’s and the LHC judgments in the ZAB case based on the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.

During Wednesday's proceedings, one of the court’s amici, former judge Manzoor Ahmed Malik, informed the court that the approver in the case, Masood Mahmood, had testified that Bhutto ordered him to murder Kasuri.

“The statement of the second witness was ignored because it contradicted the claim made by the approver, Masood Mahmood,” he said.

CJ Isa asked for the pardon notification for the approver.

“Mahmood also belongs to Kasur district. Did the person who ordered the murder not know that Masood and Ahmed Raza Kasuri both hail from the same area? Did the Supreme Court and the High Court assess this aspect?”

The judge noted that people from the same area often develop differences and even enmity.

“Have investigations been conducted into this aspect to determine if someone else gave the order for Kasuri’s murder and blamed the former prime minister for it? Why did the witness’s conscience awaken after three years?"" he questioned.

The court ordered Attorney-General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan to provide details about relocating the approver to a foreign country.

The counsel for Bhutto’s grandchildren, Fatima Bhutto and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Junior, noted that Justice Nasim Hasan Shah, one of the SC judges who had convicted Bhutto, later admitted that the judiciary was helpless during the martial law.

""This is a general statement. Will it apply to all of his decisions?” Justice Yahya Afridi asked.

Justice Sardar Tariq Masood asked, ""Will we reopen all cases from the martial law era?"" Many cases, including the Wali Khan case, have reached the Supreme Court since. If we open the floodgates once, there will be an inundation of cases,” he said.

The CJ remarked that Justice Nasim Hasan Shah's statement is not related to the Bhutto case verdict. The court's duty is only to answer the questions raised in the presidential reference, he said.

Justice Mansoor Ali Shah said there is a need to first clarify which legal question is raised in the reference, adding that the Supreme Court cannot make amendments to the presidential reference.

“The legal question should be whether there was bias in the judges. Our response will then be based on that. Another legal question could be whether there was pressure on judges during the trial.

“The court does not feel ashamed to rectify its mistake, but please provide the procedure. It is still not clear what legal question has been raised in the reference,” he said.

The CJ remarked that some new questions have arisen during the hearing. “Could the investigation be reopened? Could the LHC directly hear the trial? These are the questions that need to be examined.”
When court assistant Aitzaz Ahsan cited institutional bias as the reason, Justice Yahya Afridi responded that three judges of the Supreme Court had dissented from the decision to hang Bhutto, so the argument of institutional bias was not correct.

Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail added that two judges of the LHC had granted bail to Bhutto, and the judge who was removed by Bhutto and was reinstated by General Ziaul Haq had opposed Bhutto's hanging.

The court later directed all parties to complete their arguments by the next hearing, noting that no further time would be given to any party. The court then adjourned till Monday.

6,May 9 case adjourned without proceedings,Police peacefully disperse PTI workers at Adiala Jail,"Police dispersed a large number of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) workers, who had gathered outside the Adiala Jail on the occasion of a hearing of the 12 cases related to the violence on May 9, 2023, against party founder Imran Khan and others.

The hearing of the case was adjourned until March 13 without any proceedings, as Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Judge Malik Ijaz Asif was on leave. The court staff marked the presence of the accused, Imran Khan and Shah Mahmood Qureshi, inside the jail.

The presence of 498 other accused, who were on bail, was marked at the gate of the Adiala Jail, where a large number of PTI workers had gathered. On the occasion, they raised slogans, but the police dispersed them in a peaceful manner.

Those who came to the Adiala Jail for the hearing included Sadaqat Abbasi, a former PTI member of the National Assembly; Umar Tanveer Butt, a former member of the provincial assembly; Seemabya Tahir, and others.

Separately, a civil court in Islamabad summoned the PTI founder in a case about intimidating a female judge. During the hearing, civil judge Mureed Abbas accepted a petition for the issuance of Imran’s production order for the court appearance and adjourned the hearing until April 3.

Meanwhile, Qureshi filed an appeal in the Islamabad High Court for the suspension of his sentence in the cipher case. He said in the petition that “conspiracy or treason” could not be proved and that it was not his responsibility to protect the cipher, which went missing from the Prime Minister’s Office.

7,"Will IHC suspend Imran, wife’s sentences?",Capital’s high court to hear couple’s pleas against their convictions today,"PTI founder and deposed prime minister Imran Khan has approached the Islamabad High Court(IHC) against the sentences handed down to him in the cipher case and Toshakhana (gift repository) reference, seeking their suspension and his release on bail.

Similarly, his wife Bushra Bibi has filed a plea with the IHC against the punishment she received in the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) Toshakhana reference. IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb have asked the parties to respond by Thursday (today).

The court further directed the petitioners’ lawyers to present their arguments on the maintainability of the pleas for the suspension of the sentences. However, the question remains whether the sentences can be suspended.

Earlier, the IHC had suspended Imran’s three-year sentence, handed down by an additional district and sessions judge in a case related to non-disclosure of the gifts he had received during his term as the prime minister in his statements of assets and liability, and granted him bail.

Then the PTI's lawyers had presented arguments on the trial court's decision as well as on the duration of the sentence. They had contended that the suspension of the three-year sentence until the final decision on the central appeal was necessary to fulfill the requirements of justice.

They had added that the suspension of the sentence was necessary because the period of three years would be considered a short-term punishment.

In response, the lawyer representing the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had argued that it was not a short-term punishment but the maximum one according to the law. The IHC then had issued an order to suspend the punishment.

However, Imran was sentenced to 10 years in jail in the cipher case. The former premier and his wife Bushra Bibi were sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment in the Toshakhana reference. According to the NAB law, a 14-year jail term is the maximum sentence upon conviction.

Legal experts believe that even 10 years of imprisonment in the cipher case cannot be considered a short-term punishment. Therefore, they say, the lawyers representing Imran and his wife have to present a strong case for the maintainability of various applications. They add that the legal issues in the decisions along with the judicial opinions should also be presented before the court.

The IHC CJ had received a plea against the appointment of a special court judge under the Official Secrets Act and challenging the jail trial but rejected it.

Then, an IHC bench headed by Justice Aurangzeb annulled the proceedings of the special court on an intra-court appeal, and the matter was started again with the indictment.

Later, Justice Aurangzeb once again declared the proceedings null and void after the statements of some witnesses were recorded during the jail trial.

The legal experts say that both these judges have already heard the cipher case so it has to be seen how the lawyers of the petitioners somehow acquire relief for their clients.

Apparently, there is no possibility of the suspension of punishment during Thursday’s hearing because the court has sought replies from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and NAB.

If for any reason NAB and the FIA seek more time for preparation, then the matter of suspension of the sentences will be postponed till the next hearing.

Former Islamabad advocate general Jahangir Jadoon explained that Section 426 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was related to the suspension of the sentence. He added that suspension of Imran’s sentence would depend on various factors.

Jadoon elaborated that if the appeal was delayed because of the prosecution, then the sentences could be suspended. He added that if the prosecution was not using delaying tactics in the appeal and the sentence was less than six months, the chances of its suspension would be less.

He pointed out that a three-year sentence was more likely to be suspended. However, he continued that if it involved 10 years or 14 years of sentence then, the court would look at the law under which the sentences could be suspended. “It will be the responsibility of the lawyers of the convicts to satisfy the court that their sentences should be suspended,” he said.
