Justice Ali Baqar Najafi announced a reserved verdict dismissing the petition for not being maintainable.
Mr Raja, who contested the election as a PTI-backed independent candidate, pleaded through a counsel that the court had ordered the RO to make a decision according to the law, based on the petitioner’s request.
However, the counsel said the RO ignored the court’s order and did not even summon Mr Raja to present his stance. He said the defiance of the court orders falls under contempt of court and is a punishable offense.
The counsel asked the court to initiate contempt proceedings against the RO for not complying with the court’s decision.
Justice Najafi had directed the RO to consolidate the Feb 8 election results in the NA-128 in the presence of all candidates including the petitioner.
Mr Raja had challenged the victory of Awn Chaudhry of the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP).
BAIL: A Lahore High Court two-judge bench on Wednesday disposed of a petition of PTI founder Imran Khan for protective bail in Toshakhana case for being infructuous.
The bench had granted protective bail to Khan in June last year.
The bench was informed on Wednesday that the petitioner had been convicted in the case.
At this, the bench disposed of the petition being infructuous.

1,"Police nab another hitman, handlers in Balaj murder case","In the related development, the Punjab government has formed a joint investigation team (JIT) to probe the high profile murder case.","LAHORE: The Organised Crime Unit (OCU) and the investigation police have reportedly busted a major network, including another hired shooter, handlers and facilitators, in connection with the murder of Ameer Balaj Tipu, the young son of Lahore’s underworld don late Arif Ameer alias Tipu Truckanwala.
Of them, Ahsan Shah, believed to be a close friend of Balaj, had provided information to Teefi Butt about the Balaj’s presence at a wedding party in Chuhng where he was allegedly murdered by a hitman, Muzaffar Hussain, on Feb 19.
The other key facilitator, Ali Asghar, was arrested from Panja Gali, a spot which is about one and a half hour away from Oghi tehsil of Mansehra district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The calls and the locations of two mobile phones used in the murder plan of Balaj helped the OCU staff to reach the second hired shooter and other suspects who were close to underworld don Khawaja Tareef Gulshan alias Teefi Butt and Khawaja Aqeel alias Gogi Butt.
Muzaffar Hussain was allegedly shot dead on the spot soon after the deadly attack on Balaj Tipu.
In the related development, the Punjab government has formed a joint investigation team (JIT) to probe the high profile murder case.
The team comprised Saddar Division Investigation SP Dr Mustansar Ata Bajwa and OCU SP Aftab Phularwan, the officers known for their professionalism and potential, to investigate complicated cases.
The OCU has transferred the case and handed over all the arrested suspects to the JIT to initiate further action.
An official privy to the development told Dawn that the OCU team hit the breakthrough by tracing the suspects through the calls of two mobile phones which were used before, during and after the murder of Balaj Tipu.
He said one of the mobile phones was found switched off on the premises of Teefi Butt in Naseerabad and the other went offline at the crime scene where Balaj was allegedly shot dead.
The official said Teefi Butt fled the country at 7:28am, very next day of the murder.
He said the OCU teams which were working on the mobile phones got to know that one of the cell phones was once switched on in Abbottabad.
This was an important lead for the OCU police which managed to trace its location in the ‘no go area’ of Panja Gali from where they managed to arrest Ali Ashgar, a trusted employee of Teefi Butt.
Ali Asghar told the investigators that a close friend of Balaj Tipu, namely Ahsan Shah, a resident of Ravi Road, was one of the suspects who played a key role to help masterminds of the murder plan to trace and reach young Balaj.
Ali Asghar told the detectives that an influential man from America contacted a suspect Malik Sohail in Lahore to manage a meeting of Ahsan Shah with Teefi Butt.
The official said Malik Sohail finally convinced Ahsan Shah for Rs50 million to provide inside information to trace Balaj Tipu.
He was paid Rs5m in advance, he said, adding that Ahsan Shah visited and met Teefi Butt at his Naseerabad residence many times.
Each time, he changed vehicle to hold a meeting with Teefi Butt in order to keep his identity and the plan secret.
Both sides met 10 times, the official quoted Ali Asghar as having said.
He added that as soon as Ahsan Shah provided information about Balaj’s personal activities, Teefi Butt suggested him to go to Saudi Arabia to perform Umra.
Meanwhile, the alleged masterminds engaged the other ‘trustworthy’ men, including Muzamil, Amir, Sher alias Mota and Khalid.
The official said Ali Asghar told the investigators that according to the plan two shooters, including Muzaffar, would open fire on Balaj Tipu at the wedding ceremony.
As part of the plan, the armed men of Teefi Butt were tasked with killing both shooters soon after the murder of Balaj Tipu.
As soon as the shooters completed the task, one of them was allegedly killed on the spot as per the plan, he said, adding that the other one, however, fled the scene as the situation had turned risky for him when the armed gunmen of Balaj Tipu immediately resorted to aerial firing.
The official said there were also some conflicting reports about the presence of Teefi Butt at the crime scene which were yet to be confirmed.
One the next day of the killing of Balaj Tipu, he said, one of the wives of Muzaffar Hussain got a call from Turkmenistan.
The caller shared grief over her husband’s killing and assured her that she would be provided complete protection.
To a question, the police official said Muzamil and Amir have also been arrested by the OCU while teams are working to nab all other suspects.
He said two masterminds Teefi Butt and Gogi Butt are still at large.

The deceased was identified as one-year-old Meerab Muzaffar.
There are also reports that girl’s mother Sobat Muzaffar sustained injuries in the incident and is currently undergoing treatment at a hospital.
According to the FIR filed by Sobat’s cousin Faizan, the incident occurred on Feb 25 when she was visiting the park along with her daughter and other family members.
He said the contractor of the Zip Line swing, Jamshed, was operating it carelessly despite being aware that many families were present there.
Suddenly, he said, the swing hit Meerab’s head, causing multiple head injuries. When her mother rushed to her, she also got injured, he added. Both were later taken to a hospital where Meerab succumbed to her injuries.
Faizan declared it a criminal negligence on the part of both project director Imran and contractor Jamshed, which led to the death of the minor girl and injuries to her mother.

3,Rape cases: Plea for striking down law criminalising abortion,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has been requested to strike down the law criminalising abortion to the extent of rape...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has been requested to strike down the law criminalising abortion to the extent of rape victims.
“The pro-choice is a reality, which is why it is important that women should have access to medical services without any preconceived notions and biases,” says a public interest petition filed by Advocate Aasya Ismail.
The lawyer pleads that pro-choice, the freedom to choose abortion, is a fundamental right.
The lawyer argues that the law in the country criminalises the abortion under sections 338 and 338-B of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) describing it as intentionally “causing miscarriage” except in cases where abortion is carried out to save the life of the woman.
The petitioner pleads that the punishment of incarceration is merely flawed to exercise a woman’s right to pro-choice, therefore, the law needs to be revisited.
The lawyer says the right to pro-choice, irrespective of their marital status, is not provided in cases of rape, fetus impairment, economical and social pressure, therefore, the protection of women is not available in the law.
The lawyer argues that the healthcare providers need to understand that freedom to abortion is neither against the law nor against religion and all those seeking the right should be treated with respect.
She says the Constitution failed to provide any fundamental right to pro-choice.
She contends that the impugned sections of the PPC, which addresses the subject of abortion, are vague and silent on the pro-choice. However, she points out that the countries like UK, US, Scotland, Northern Ireland and India enshrined pro-choice and evolved their criminal law.
The lawyer argues that a state cannot set a policy to control women’s bodies, terming it anti-democratic and a violation of fundamental rights.
The petitioner asks the court to decriminalise the abortion under the existing law to grant freedom to abortion as a fundamental right to the women of Pakistan.

5,Italian trade attache office to help boost bilateral ties: envoy,"Ms Armellin says her country has invested in projects to fight climate change, improve agriculture, child nutrition"," 

Ms Marilina Armellin

LAHORE: Italy’s ambassador to Pakistan Ms Marilina Armellin says the establishment of the office of trade attaché in the embassy for the first time in last 75 years will help boost bilateral trade and investment relationships between the two countries.
The top Italian diplomat in Pakistan, who took over her assignment here only a few weeks back, told Dawn during her first visit to Lahore that now the Italian embassy has a dedicated office, trade personnel, and financial resources to promote bilateral business ties with Pakistan.
Ms Armellin said one of her first objectives is to “further bolster our bilateral relationships, which are already very cordial for the last 75 years when this country was born. Our new embassy building in Islamabad is a tangible sign of our commitment to this country as it is the first construction Italy has made abroad in 70 years.
“And of course there’s a lot to do on trade. We have a vantage point there as we can harness the potential of the large Pakistani community living in Italy, one of the largest Pakistani communities in the European Union. We are talking about 300,000 people. They contribute greatly to our society as there are workers, entrepreneurs, students and researchers, and, you know, we can count on this capital of friendship to make Pakistan a better known place (for trade and investment) to our companies and business community in Italy.”

Ms Armellin says her country has invested in projects to fight climate change, improve agriculture, child nutrition

She said what we have now mostly is trade with Pakistan as both nations have very compatible economic systems because Italy is one of the top manufacturers and exporters of machinery - textile machinery, agricultural and smart irrigation systems. “This is what your companies need here.”
On direct Italian investment in Pakistan, Ms Armellin said both countries should step up efforts to make Pakistan more known to Italian investors who have interest towards Asia and also towards Pakistan, which is less known in Italy than other Asian economies, for boosting direct investment from Italy. “Thus we need to make an effort in this respect. Then improving the business environment here would also help attract investment from my country and elsewhere.”
She went on: “I’m a newcomer here and may not have a full picture. But I met a number of Italian businesses before coming here and they told me that Pakistan has great potential but there’s policy uncertainty and bureaucratic red tape that prevent smooth investment in here. Then in 2024 we are in a post-poll transition period and in such conditions the business community waits for and sees how the economic agenda of the new government would develop.”
The envoy was quite appreciative of efforts made by Pakistan to improve labour rights, human rights and governance as required by the EU trade concessions under its GSP Plus programme.
“Pakistan has made considerable improvements in 27 core UN conventions under the GSP plus trade concessions from the EU. There’s improvement in human rights, labour rights, environmental protection and good governance. I take it as a process that each country needs to follow and not just Pakistan. So we supported Pakistan and concessions for Pakistan trade as these give access to Pakistan exporters to EU markets. We want these trade concessions for Pakistan to continue as these are beneficial for this country, its economy and its people.”
Ms Armellin said: “We are all waiting for formation of a new government and would continue to work with it on challenges that we talked about before. We are waiting to see the agenda of the new coalition government as the loan negotiations with the IMF that we believe would begin over the next few weeks.
“The agenda of the new minority government will be very important because it may have to agree on certain measures (with other parties for their support). It is a very important moment of transition for this country and we hope that the new government will perform not only on the economic front but also for the benefit of the people. Her advice for the incoming government is to improve the trade and economic environment, and invest heavily in education.”
Speaking about Italy’s support for Pakistan after the 2022 floods, she said Italy had stepped up when the flood hit. “We also have a long history of collaboration on environmental issues as in Italy we also face the same problems of soil erosion, melting glaciers, floods and earthquakes. So we relate with you very much. So we have invested in projects here that are important to fight climate change and improve agriculture and child nutrition and resilient production for affected communities. An Italian organisation is also mapping all the glaciers of Pakistan that are the biggest source of fresh water. The report will hopefully be released in April.”

6,LAC plans theatrical productions by veteran playwrights,They say the theatrical productions will also include parallel theatre performances.,"LAHORE: The Lahore Arts Council will present theatrical productions written by veteran playwrights, officials tell Dawn.
There is an acute dearth of theatrical performances. With a view to filling this vacuum, this step is being taken not only to stage meaningful and socially relevant theatre but also to provide masses with quality entertainment.
They say the theatrical productions will also include parallel theatre performances. Formation of a folk dance ensemble is also in the offing.
There are many parallel theatre groups in Lahore who are looking for an opportunity to perform at the Alhamra Art Centre, The Mall, and Alhamra Cultural Complex, Gaddafi Stadium.
The council, on the other hand, is also interested in staging plays written by the likes of Athar Shah Khan, Munir Raj, Imtiaz Ali Taj, Subhani Bayunus, Kamal Ahmed Rizvi and other prominent figures.
The council will choose plays not only from its archival collection but will also ask new writers to contribute.
The council has a treasure of old plays with its archival section. The council is also contacting different parallel theatre groups for their monthly performances at Alhamra.
Many parallel theatre groups mainly comprise young artistes from different colleges and universities which are immensely interested to present their productions from the platform of Alhamra. The council will delineate a structure for their performances.
As per the officials, the council is also pondering over the formation of a folk dance troupe. Punjab has a magnificent enriched cultural tradition in the shape of different folk dances, such as Bhangra, Seraiki charmer, Luddi, and romantic tales, such as Heer Ranjha, Sohni Mahiwal and Mirza Sahiban.
The council already has an Alhamra Academy of Performing Arts which is catering to visual art and performing art classes. The council will make arrangements to train upcoming young folk dancers who would perform both nationally and internationally and would give regular performances at Alhamra of their colourful dances.
Earlier, the Lahore Arts Council has also started a series of musical evenings titled ‘melody nights’ where young and seasoned singers regularly perform three days a week.
Khurram Naveel, an official from Alhamra, says the council is exploring every single possibility to provide quality entertainment to music and theatre lovers. Mr Naveel says after Ramazan all these activities will be streamlined.

The lawyers, who have been on protest for almost two months, marched from Aiwan-i-Adl to GPO Chowk chanting slogans against Lahore High Court Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti.
Earlier, addressing a general house meeting, LBA President Muneer Hussain Bhatti said the chief justice took a unilateral decision of shifting the courts only to divide the legal community. He said the lawyers would foil every attempt to break their unity.
He gave an ultimatum to CJ-designate Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan to withdraw the notification by March 10.
Justice Bhatti is set to superannuate on March 7.
A lawyer claimed that the shifting of the courts was not even discussed in the administration committee, which comprises seven senior most judges of the LHC.
He said the senior judges confirmed the bar that the outgoing chief justice had not made any consultation with them before issuing the notification.
The case filing branches at the district courts have been closed for two months due to the protest by the lawyers, causing problems to the litigants.
The lawyers also claim to have faced financial losses due to the protest.
However, they are adamant in their stance against the shifting of the courts.

Gujrat Deputy Commissioner Safdar Virk inaugurated the theatres as well as the offices for doctors and nursing staff in the same building.
The theatres and offices for medical and nursing staff have been established as a public-private partnership project (PPP mode) in collaboration with the Rasheeda Shafi Foundation (RSF) and a local philanthropist.
ABSTH Medical Superintendent Dr Asif Mehmood and other prominent social figures were also present at the occasion.
Speaking to the participants in the inaugural ceremony, the DC said the theatres had been set up for orthopaedic and general surgeries in addition to the existing theatres as per the increasing requirements in the trauma centre.

11,All set for excavation at Ganweriwala ancient site from today,"About 4,000-year old town along Hakra river was part of Indus Valley Civilisation.","SAHIWAL: After a two-month delay, the excavation at the site of the ancient city of Ganweriwala believed to be buried under the Cholistan desert for the last 4,000 to 5,000 years is going to be inaugurated on Thursday (today).
The project is starting after a delay of two months for ‘some technical and security reasons’. Sources said the ongoing jeep rally, the arrival of the Arab guests for hunting of houbara bustard in Cholistan and Thar deserts and the finalisation of modalities between the Department of Archeology and the divisional administration of Bahawalpur were some of the hiccups that caused the delay in excavation.
Muhammad Hasan, the director of archeology, told Dawn a Rs20m grant had already been approved for the excavation. He said all arrangements had been completed for excavation.
The grant was reportedly approved on the initiative of Governor Baleeghur Rehman with joint efforts of culture and heritage expert Dr Sajida Vandal, Bahawalpur Commissioner Ehtasham Anwar and the Punjab Department of Archeology.

About 4,000-year old town along Hakra river was part of Indus Valley Civilisation

The project is being executed by the archaeology department, in collaboration with the Thaap Heritage, led by Sajida Vandal, who is the Unisco consultant on heritage. Thaap has executing Bhatti Gate, Phase I project, in Lahore with the assistance of World Bank in collaboration with the Punjab Walled Cities Authority.
The site of the ancient city of Ganweriwala was discovered by Dr Rafiq Mughal, professor of emeritus at Boston University, USA, in the 1970s. He leads the excavation team along with Saleemul Haq, former DG Archeology, Muhammad Afzal, senior archeologist, Maqsood Ahmed, expert in conservation and artifacts preservation, Muhammad Hasan, director, Dr Sajida Vandal and some faculty members of archeology department from various public universities of Punjab.
Mr Hasan said during the coming two months the archeological excavation along with the preservation of remains and archeological structures and artifacts would be done at Ganweriwala mounds.
Dr Rafiq Mughal said Ganweriwala was buried along the Hakra river bed in Cholistan.

Ganweriwala was probably the third largest city within the Indus Valley Civilisation and it is believed to have been a major centre from 2,600BC to 1,900BC. The Indus Valley Civilisation was a Bronze Age civilisation that, at its zenith, had an estimated population of 5m.
Together with Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, it was one of the earliest complex civilisations. Ganweriwala is believed to have followed the typical Indus Civilisation town planning. It had an upper town and a lower town as indicated by the presence of a high and a mound.
Ganweriwala is situated about 60km southwest of Derawar Fort on the dry bed of the Ghaggar-Hakra River, which is now a part of the vast Cholistan desert. Four different sizes of archeological sites have so far been reported by different scholars who visited the site on different occasions.
Dr Nasrulla, the ex-chairman of Seraiki Department, Islamia University Bahawalpur, says the land surrounding the site is inhospitable and unsuitable for cultivation but in the past the region was fed by the Hakra River, making the land fertile and cultivable. The inhabitants were not only growing crops but also involved in animal husbandry.
The extent, size and presence of certain specific features fully qualify the archaeological site of Ganweriwala in the Cholistan desert to be declared as one of the great cities within the Indus Valley Civilisation.
Although the site was discovered in 1975 by Dr Rafiq Mughal, it could not be excavated due to a lack of resources, especially the unavailability of water resources near the site and a sparse population to fulfill the requirement of labour.
Dr Mughal observed the presence of mud-brick walls at the site, similar to those found at other Indus Valley sites. “The surface collection from the site, apart from the pottery, comprises some important antiquities such as unicorns, figurines, a copper seal, and an impressed clay tablet.”
Dr Mughal said for the last two decades, the site had become extremely vulnerable due to development activities in the Cholistan desert. The construction of a jeep track has already divided the area into two parts which was very harmful, Dr Mughal further added.
Dr Sajida Vandal told Dawn the future of the Ganweriwala was not safe until a full-fledged archaeological excavation was conducted at the site and proper fencing of the protected area was executed. “But this (excavation) is the beginning towards a big giant step,” she added.

Suspects Ghulam Muhammad Khan Sehar, Sajid Khan Sehar and Mohiuddin Khan Sehar, all belonging to an influential political family, were named in a first information report.
The wildlife officials found bird sounds on a loudspeaker, illegal weapons, and slaughtered wild ducks (murghabi) at the crime scene at Patan Shinwala on the River Indus.
Wildlife official Imtiaz Hussain reported that during the raid, the suspects fired at him and, at gunpoint, seized all birds before fleeing the scene.
The suspect not only threatened wildlife employees but also interfered with their car at Patan Shinwala of the Indus. Raids are being conducted to arrest the suspects.
Officials stated the several poachers were involved in the hunting of migratory birds at Taunsa Barrage on the Indus too. Despite frequent complaints from local residents about illegal hunting, the wildlife department has failed to take action.
Senior member Malik Khadim Hussain of Sindho Bachao Tarla, a civil society working with local communities, alleged when poachers were caught, the department often dealt leniently, registering nominal cases where fines were paid, allowing the accused to be released.
SMUGGLED OIL: The Layyah police thwarted the smuggling of a large quantity of Iranian oil through the River Indus.
The arrested suspects Bilal Hussain, Mukhtiar Hussain, Muhammad Sawal, and Rafiq were trying to transport Iranian oil via boats for illegal sale.
The suspects fired at the police party during the operation, but no casualties or property damage occurred.
Karor DSP Shakeel Ahmed arrived at the scene, commending the efforts of the officials involved.
The police registered a case against the suspects who fired on the police party. Iranian petrol, smuggled by the accused, was seized at the scene.
ACCIDENT: One Rescue 1122 official died, and another was seriously injured in a road accident early on Wednesday morning.
The officials were on their way home when their motorcycle collided with a tractor-trolley loaded with sugarcane. Imran died at the scene, while the injured Tariq was taken to a hospital.
