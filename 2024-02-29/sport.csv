0,HBL PSL 2024: Munro stars as United pummel listless Kings,It was an opening onslaught by Islamabad’s Colin Munro and Alex Hales as both seasoned campaigners hit out at ease.,"KARACHI: Karachi Kings’ homecoming wasn’t the one they were looking for. Here at the National Bank Stadium on Wedn­esday, the crowd came in in meagre numbers and  there was hardly any excitement as the ninth edition of the HBL Pakistan Super League arrived in the city.
The dead vibe, it seemed, got the better of the Kings, who showed no fight whatsoever as Islamabad United bulldozed over them to register a seven-wicket wicket win.
It was an opening onslaught by Islamabad’s Colin Munro and Alex Hales as both seasoned campaigners hit out at ease, making the pitch look like it was a different one when Karachi batted.
Although Hales and Munro departed after scoring 47 off 35 balls and 82 off 47 respectively, they put up an opening stand of 108.
Their dismissals did slow down things for Islamabad, with Imad Wasim losing his wicket early,  but Salman Ali Agha hit 25 off 17 to take his team across the line with nine balls to spare as Karachi rued not doing enough after being put into bat by the visitors earlier.
Karachi’s start was shaky and the proceedings stayed slow for them until Kieron Pollard and Irfan Khan Niazi made some kind of amends deep into the innings.
 

ISLAMABAD United’s opener Colin Munro drives during his 82-run knock.—PPI

Pollard, uncharacteristically of the former West Indies player, nudged for singles and doubles through most of his time on the crease for his unbeaten 48 off 28 balls after Karachi had lost five wickets for just 89 runs by the start of the 14th over.
Irfan, meanwhile, ensured he stuck along with the veteran and ended up contributing a cameo of 27 not out off 22.
Both had to stretch their stay in the middle after a slow start by Karachi, for whom the top-order batters failed to show up.
New Zealand’s Tim Seifert, who had joined the Kings a day earlier, was the first to go, and as early as in the second over, getting stumped by Islamabad wicket-keeper Azam Khan after being deceived by Imad Wasim’s flight.
The early wicket kept Karachi restricted to 46-1 by the end of the powerplay despite Leus de Plooy’s counter-punching effort as he came in as first drop.
Azam missed a run out chance as he failed to collect the ball with de Plooy was far from the crease, but the Englishman was cleaned up by Salman on the next ball.
Shan, who was struggling to find runs and was scoring at less than run-a-ball, was undone by Hunain Shah’s yorker as the right-armer sent the off-stump flying.
Karachi were 73-3 at the halfway stage and went deeper into trouble when a lightning quick pick and throw from Shadab at short-cover capitalised on confusion in the middle to run out Shoaib Malik  in the 11th over.
Mohammad Nawaz chipped Naseem into the hands of Shadab at cover, slowing down things further with Pollard and Irfan on the crease.
Karachi’s 100 came up in the 15th over and the next boundary after a gap of three overs, when Pollard flicked Rumman Raees’ medium pace for four and guided an off-stump yorker for another.
The penultimate over saw Irfan dispatch Rum­man for three fours before Pollard hit the innings’ first six in the last over.
The duo’s approach, however, did not get Karachi even close to a competitive total.
United’s response was lethal from the word go, as Hales drilled pacer Mir Hamza for consecutive boun­d­aries in the third over, before Munro made it worse for the left-armer to wrap it up.
Munro and Hales toget­her managed boundaries in each of the next three overs to register 60-0 by the end of the powerplay.
Even after the field restrictions were lifted, the pairing did not relent. The eighth over saw Munro launching chinaman Tabraiz Shamsi for three consecutive sixes, one of them coming off a switch-hit and the other two slow sweeps over the leg-side boundary as the batter crossed the 50-run mark.
Hales departed when he holed out pacer Hasan Ali to Irfan at midwicket in the 12th over, but Munro kept going as he carted Hasan over deep backway square for another six.
The former New Zea­land opener earned anot­her boundary off Nawaz in the 15th only to get trapped lbw by the left-arm spinner two balls later.
Following the openers’ return to the pavilion, the surface showed signs of aging as the ball kept low and slow. Imad, however, threw his wicket away as he played Shamsi right into the hands of Shan at cover off a loose ball.
Salman and the incoming Shadab Khan respe­cted the conditions, before the former launched Hasan for two handsome sixes to wrap up the proceedings.

1,Organisers keen on cricket in 2026 Asian Games despite venue headache,Cricket administrators perceive multi-sport eve­nts like the Asian Games as an opportunity to boost the game.,"NEW DELHI: The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) is eager to have cricket at the 2026 Asian Games in Japan and is exploring the idea of converting a baseball stadium in Nagoya for this purpose.
Cricket administrators perceive multi-sport eve­nts like the Asian Games as an opportunity to boost the game, which will return to the Olympics at Los Angeles 2028 after a 128-year gap.
Cricket featured in the Hangzhou Games in China last year but wasn’t part of the 2018 Games in Jakarta and Palembang in Indonesia.
“We are still working on the sports programme for the 2026 Games but yes, we would want cricket to be part of it,” OCA acting president Randhir Singh said.
The lack of cricket facilities in Japan, however, remains an issue. There is an international cricket stadium in Tochigi prefecture, north of Tokyo, but the OCA prefers a facility in or around Nagoya, the capital of Aichi prefecture where the Games will be held.
The Tochigi stadium would be a three-and-a-half hour drive from Nagoya, said OCA Deputy Director General Vinod Kumar Tiwari, who visited Japan last month with an OCA coordination committee to oversee preparations.
“We are working with the Asian Cricket Council on this,” Tiwari said.
The programme for the 2026 Games will be finalised at an OCA General Assembly in April.
“It will be great to have cricket in the 2026 Games, and we at JCA will provide all kind of support,” Japan Cricket Association chief executive Naoki Alex Miy­aji said. “It would leave a fantastic legacy, and go a long way in promoting the game in the country.”

2,Punjab chief secretary among seven government officials inducted into PCB,PM Kakar silently made an amendment to the PCB constitution which increased the number of his nominees on the PCB board of gove­rnors.,"LAHORE: Seven government officials, including Punjab chief secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman, have been inducted into the Pakistan Cricket Board, as outgoing Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar continues to take long-term decisions before an elected prime minister takes charge in the first week of March to take major steps as PCB patron-in-chief.
First, the caretaker PM nominated Mohsin Naqvi for the post of PCB chairman. At that time, Mohsin was also working as caretaker chief minister Punjab. Later, he was elected as PCB chief on Feb 6, two days before the general elections in the country.
Anwaar silently made an amendment to the PCB constitution, which increased the number of his nominees from two to three on the PCB Board of Gove­rnors, the principal think-tank of the cricket board.
First, Anwar had named two nominees including Mohsin besides retaining Mustafa Ramday, who was nominated by then prime minister Shahbaz Sharif along with Zaka Ashraf.
And now Zahid has been incorporated, increasing the number of PM’s nominees.
Moreover, the Establishment Division issued the orders of government officials including Sohail Ashraf (BS-20), Zain Asim (BS-18), Abdullah Khurram Niazi (BS-18), Irtiza Komail and Rafiullah to join the PCB.
According to sources, a police official Usman will also join the PCB.
When contacted, a PCB official confirmed to Dawn that the orders regarding some of the officials had been issued by the Establishment Division. However so far, it is not clear as to what job they would do.
“Currently, the PCB chairman is on leave, and is abroad with his family. When he returns the situation about the jobs of these government officials will be decided,” the PCB official said on the condition of anonymity.
It may be mentioned here that Abdullah Khurram, who will leave his post as deputy commissioner, Jhang, a native town of Mohsin, to join the PCB, had already worked as secretary of the defunct Punjab Cricket Association during Ehsan Mani’s tenure under the 2019 PCB constitution, which was replaced with the 2014 constitution, which was restored by the Shahbaz-led government in 2022.
Sources said though the Establishment Division had issued the notification on Sohail Ashraf’s transfer to the PCB, the Punjab government had not relieved him yet.
All these government officials, sources added, would run the PCB on higher positions as several directors in the PCB may lose their jobs.

3,Adair’s five-wicket haul puts Ireland on top,ABU DHABI: A first five-wicket haul in Test cricket for Mark Adair put Ireland in a strong position after the...,"ABU DHABI: A first five-wicket haul in Test cricket for Mark Adair put Ireland in a strong position after the opening day of their one-off Test against Afghanistan in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.
The Northern Irish all-rounder posted figures of 5-39 to help bowl the opposition out for 155 after Afghan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi won the toss and elected to bat.
An otherwise excellent day for Ireland was dampened by the late fall of the wickets of Curtis Campher for 49, ending a 60-run third-wicket stand with Harry Tector, and of nightwatchman Theo van Woerkom.
Ireland appeared to be cruising in reply until a late Afghan fightback led by spinner Zia-ur-Rehman left Andy Balbirnie’s side four wickets down and 55 runs short of the Afghan total.
With less than half an hour of play left in the day, the Afgha­nistan left-armer claimed Campher, one shy of a half-century, and Van Woerkom clean bowled.
Without their inju­red talisman Rashid Khan, Afgha­nistan struggled to find fluency in their first innings and only had four batters reach double figures on what appeared to be a good batting surface.
Adair opened his account for the day in the seventh over when he had Noor Ali Zad­ran caught by Balbi­rnie for just seven.
Then when fellow opener Ibrahim Zad­ran, Noor Ali’s neph­ew, fell for 53 it capped off a middle-order collapse where Afghanistan went from 66-3 to 90-6.
An undefeated 41 from Karim Janat, however, gave them some respectability.
Ireland’s response seemed to be faltering when both openers fell within 10 overs un­til the partnership of Campher and Tector.
Still without a win since gaining Test status in 2017, Ireland will resume play on day two with Tector (32 not out) and Paul Stirling in the middle.
Afghanistan also became a Test nation in the same year and have since claimed three wins in the format, including one against Ireland in 2019.

Officials said the 26-year-old would not be included for the first two games in the three-match tournament, in line with his Intern­ational Cricket Council ban last week.
Hasaranga, a leg-break bowler, was penalised for abusing an umpire during a T20 match Sri Lanka lost to Afghanistan.
He remonstrated with on-field umpire Lyndon Han­nibal after the match, for his decision not to call a no-ball on a high delivery to Kamindu Mendis in the final over, with Sri Lanka needing 11 from three balls.
The first T20 match will be played on March 4.
Sri Lanka will also play three One-day Interna­tio­nals and two Tests during their tour of Bangladesh, which ends on April 3.
T20 squad: Wanindu Hasaranga (capt), Charith Asalanka, Kusal Mendis, Sadeera Sama­rawi­ckrama, Angelo Math­ews, Dasun Shanaka, Mah­e­esh Theekshana, Dhana­njaya de Silva, Kusal Perera, Dilshan Madushanka, Nuwan Thushara, Matheesha Pathirana, Akila Dananjaya, Binura Fernando, Kamindu Mendis, Avishka Fernando and Jeffrey Vandersay.

5,Injured Conway out of first Australia Test,"“Injuries are part of cricket and present an opportunity for others,” Southee said.","WELLINGTON: New Zeal­and opening batsman Devon Conway has been ruled out of the first Test against Australia, captain Tim Southee said on Wednesday.
Conway will miss Thursday’s opener in Wellington after hurting his left thumb in a Twenty20 defeat to Australia on Friday in Auckland.
Experienced batsman Henry Nicholls has been recalled as cover for the two-Test series with Will Young moving up the order to open with Tom Latham, Southee told reporters.
“Injuries are part of cricket and present an opportunity for others,” Southee said.
Young scored an unbeaten 60 batting at number five in New Zealand’s second Test victory against South Africa earlier this month to help them a 2-0 series sweep.
It is not known if Conway will be fit for the second Test in Chr­istchurch beginning on March 8.
Southee said he would look at the weather and the pitch conditions before deciding whether to go with an all-seam attack in Wellington, meaning the 32-year-old Scott Kuggeleijn could be in line for a second Test cap.
Southee paid tribute to left-arm pace bowler Neil Wagner, 37, who announced his retirement on Tuesday after being told he would not be in the Test side against Australia.
“He’s a special guy to have in the dressing room, a man who made things happen,” said Southee of the South Africa-born Wagner, who took 260 wickets in 64 Tests. “You speak to any team-mate and they love him to bits for what he does on the field and as a person. He’ll be missed.” Australia captain Pat Cummins named the same team that lost the second Test at home to the West Indies in the drawn 1-1 series in January.
It means Steve Smith will again open the batting with Usman Khawaja.
“We’re sticking with the same eleven, no surprises,” Cummins told reporters.
New Zealand are seeking a first Test victory over the top-ranked Australia team since 2011.
On home soil against the Australians they have had even less joy, claiming their last Test win in 1993 and their last series victory in 1986 when Richard Hadlee was in his pomp.
For all of New Zealand’s achievements as a cricketing nation and their strong current roster, Tim Southee’s side have proved unable to shake themselves free from Australia’s psychological chokehold.
World champions Australia enjoyed a 3-0 sweep when they hosted the most recent Test series against New Zealand, four years ago, and will hope to round off one of the nation’s most successful seasons in cricket with victory.
Having won a maiden World Test Championship (WTC), retained the Ashes and claimed a sixth 50-over World Cup title in a glorious six months, Cummins’s side will aim to lock away the Trans-Tasman Trophy before a well-earned break from international duties.
The brevity of the two-Test series, the first between the nations in New Zealand since 2016, has prompted grumbling from fans in both nations.
Many would prefer a longer contest between the reigning WTC holders and the inaugural 2021 champions.
Australia, however, may be glad for the light load after slogging through five tests in the home summer following the World Cup triumph in India in November.
Australia’s first Test tour in eight years has generated plenty of buzz, though, with the Wellington opener long sold out.
Teams:
NEW ZEALAND (from): Tim Southee (capt), Will Young, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson, Rachin Ravindra, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Blundell, Glenn Phillips, Matt Henry, William O’Rourke, Scott Kuggeleijn, Mitchell Santner, Henry Nicholls.
AUSTRALIA: Steve Smith, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Cameron Green, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins (capt), Mitch Starc, Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood.

BLACKBURN: Blackburn Rovers’ Sammie Szmodics (L) scores during the FA Cup fifth-round match against Newcastle United at Ewood Park.—Reuters

LUTON: Erling Haaland roared back to his best form with a five-goal salvo as Manchester City thumped Luton Town 6-2 at Kenilworth Road to reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on Tuesday.
Luton had no answer to the marauding Norwegian who bagged his eighth City hat-trick before halftime and then scored twice more after the break to kill off a stirring Luton revival.
The 23-year-old Haaland’s first four goals were all created by Kevin De Bruyne. Mateo Kovacic also got on the scoresheet for holders City who are unbeaten in 18 games in all competitions.
Luton threatened an unlikely comeback when Jordan Clark found the top corner with a sublime effort on the stroke of halftime and netted again early in the second half.
But a strong City side instantly found another gear to cruise into the hat for the last eight.
Second-tier leaders Leicester City joined Pep Guardiola’s side in the quarter-finals as they beat Premier League Bournemouth 1-0 thanks to Abdul Fatawu’s extra-time goal.
Newcastle United squeezed through in a penalty shootout at Blackburn Rovers after the tie ended 1-1.
The night belonged to the unstoppable Haaland though as he became the first top-flight player to score five goals in an FA Cup tie since George Best struck six for Manchester United against Northampton Town in 1970.
“Kevin De Bruyne is massive. He is doing what he is best at. It’s a pleasure playing with him,” Haaland, whose hat-trick was his first for City away from home, told ITV. “We know what we both want from each other. It clicks well. I am getting back to my best. Finally I am feeling good. It’s an amazing feeling. It’s coming, we’re coming. Exciting times ahead. We are ready to attack.”
The only blemish for City, who face Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday, was an injury to Jack Grealish who was forced off before halftime with a recurrence of a groin injury.
Haaland had scored only five goals in his previous 11 appearances for City — a spell interrupted by a foot injury that some suggested had taken the edge off his game.
But he blew away any doubts in emphatic fashion with a sensational display of centre forward play.
“Erling was on fire and Kevin was perfect,” was Guardiola’s verdict.  “The connection they have. Erling needs a player like Kevin and Kevin needs a player like Erling.”
City meant business from the start and went ahead in the fourth minute as Matheus Nunes played in De Bruyne who cut back a perfect pass for Haaland to fire past Tim Krul.
De Bruyne played Haaland through in the 18th minute to make it 2-0 and Haaland’s hat-trick goal was almost a carbon copy as he again rolled his marker and surged on to a De Bruyne pass before dinking a deft shot over Krul.
Clark gave the home fans some cheer when he curled a perfect shot past Stefan Ortega and Luton punished City for some slack defending just after the restart with Clark finishing well.
But Haaland tapped in a De Bruyne pass a couple of minutes later and then grabbed his fifth from Bernardo Silva’s assist before being substituted, much to Luton’s relief.
Newcastle were given a big scare at Championship strugglers Blackburn. Anthony Gordon gave them the lead at Ewood Park but Rovers hit back with Samuel Szmodics taking the game to extra time in which both sides were close to nicking it.
The visitors edged through 4-3 on penalties with Blackburn captain Dominic Hyam having his kick saved by Martin Dubravka.

RUSSIA’S Daniil Medvedev hits a return against Alexander Shevchenko of Kazakhstan during their Dubai Tennis Championship round-of-32 match at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Centre.—Reuters

DUBAI: Daniil Medvedev returned to action for the first time since his Australian final defeat on Tuesday with a straight sets win over Alexander Shevchenko in Dubai.
Elsewhere, 18-year-old Jakub Mensik beat Borna Coric 48 hours after becoming the youngest finalist at a tour event since 2021, in Doha.
The man who ended the Czech teenager’s dream run in Qatar on Sunday, Karen Khachanov, was also among the round-of-32 winners.
World number four Medvedev got his title defence at the hardcourt ATP 500 event up and running, overcoming Shevchenko 6-3, 7-5.
The Russian top seed shrugged off his month-long absence — part holiday, part injury — breaking his Kazakh opponent in three consecutive return games in the first set before reeling off four games in a row from 3-5 in the second set to complete an 88-minute triumph.
In January, Medvedev reached his second Australian Open final. He lost to Rafael Nadal in the Melbourne decider two years ago, and this time had to settle for second best in the season’s opening Grand Slam to Jannik Sinner.
He was forced to skip his title defence in Doha last week because he was dealing with a number of physical issues — with his foot, adductor, and shoulder.
“In general, to be honest, I am happy with my level, because it is not easy to come back after an injury,” said Medvedev courtside. “You always try to straight away put your game back, but its not easy and I’m happy to beat such a good opponent and am looking forward to the next round.”
He added:  “When you take a week or two off, but it’s something you planned, then it’s kind of easy tennis-wise, just a couple of points or games to get back.
“I did take a week and a half off by myself and then when I came back I started feeling pain here and there, not practising 100 per cent.
“It’s very tricky, because when you come into a match you have to forget about it and when you think about something other than tennis you are going to lose the match.”
Medvedev will meet next Lorenzo Sonego after the Italian despatched wild card Sumit Nagal of India 6-4, 5-7, 6-1.
Mensik let slip a match point and then saved one in his 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (9/7) victory over Coric to book a date next with Spain’s world number 24 Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.

A police source speaking to AFP and the BFM news channel had said Tuesday that a USB key containing plans for the Paris municipal police during the Olym­pics had been lost when a city hall employee had his bag stolen on a train.
The employee put the bag on a luggage rack above his seat and discovered the loss at the busy Gare du Nord station on Monday evening, the reports said.
In a statement on Wednesday, the city said that  “initial investigations have established that the employee was not in possession of any information about the organisation or the deployment of security forces during the Olympics and Paralympics.”
It confirmed that a police complaint over a theft had been made, but said the lost items contained  “personal notes related to his work in IT support for the department of roads and transport.”
The Paris prosecutors’ office also said that the USB key  “contained only notes about road transport in Paris during the Olympics, and not sensitive security information.”
The Paris Olympics will be held from July 26-Aug 11, with around 35,000 members of the police force expected to be mobilised every day, including around two thousand municipal police officers from the capital.
About 300,000 spectators expected to attend the opening ceremony along the River Seine.
As well as managing crowds and preventing street crime, police will be on high alert for possible terror plots, with France a frequent target of Islamist extremists over the last decade.
The city employee is set to be investigated to see if he broke any internal security rules by travelling with the USB key, the statement from Paris city hall said.
The Paralympics are set to take place from Aug 28-Sept 8.

The PIF will now become the official naming partner of the men’s rankings as well as partner ATP tournaments in Indian Wells, Miami, Madrid, Beijing, the season-ending ATP Finals in Turin and the Next Gen ATP Finals staged in Jeddah.
Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in various sports like soccer, Formula One, boxing and golf in the last few years while critics accuse the oil-rich kingdom of using PIF to  “sportswash” its human rights record.
The country denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws.
The ATP said PIF had committed to developing and unlocking opportunities for young players and would also contribute to its OneVision Strategic Plan that focuses on unity, enhancing fan experiences and leveraging growth opportunities.
“Our strategic partnership with PIF marks a major moment for tennis,” ATP CEO Massimo Calvelli said in a statement. “It’s a shared commitment to propel the future of the sport.”

SAN SEBASTIAN: Sergi Darder fired the decisive spot-kick as Real Mallorca beat Real Sociedad 5-4 on penalties to book their place in the Copa del Rey final on Tuesday.
With the two sides deadlocked at 1-1 following extra-time in the return leg after a goalless first leg, it was Mallorca who will line-up in the final in Sevilla at La Cartuja stadium on April 6.
The Balearic islanders will face the winner of the second semi-final between Athletic Bilbao and Atletico Madrid.
After a goalless 140 minutes of play over the two legs, Uruguayan defender Giovanni Gonzalez finally struck to put Mallorca in control in San Sebastian.
Gonzalez latched onto a good cross from Jaume Costa to bury a close-range header past Sociedad’s keeper Alex Remiro.
But just as Mallorca’s thoughts began to turn to a first appearance in the Cup final in two decades Sociedad were back level with skipper Mikel Oyarzabal blasting home a nifty assist from Brais Mendez inside the box with half an hour of normal time remaining.
That set up a frenetic finale, but neither side was able to break the deadlock, resulting in extra-time, and then spot-kicks.
Oyarzabal was first to go only for the player who had kept Sociedad in the semi-final to miss, his shot well anticipated by Mallorca goalkeeper Dominik Greif.
Mallorca kept their nerve and with the teams level on 4-4 penalties apiece Darder stroked the ball into the bottom right corner, out of reach of Remiro’s arm, to send Mallorca to Sevilla.
Mallorca, only two spots clear of the relegation zone in La Liga, now have a shot at adding to their lone Cup success back in 2003.

12,Lyon through to French Cup semi-finals,PARIS: Olympique Lyo­n­nais continued their remarkable recent revival by beating Strasbourg 4-3 on penalties on...,"PARIS: Olympique Lyo­n­nais continued their remarkable recent revival by beating Strasbourg 4-3 on penalties on Tuesday to win through to the French Cup semi-finals after their last-eight tie finished goalless at the end of 90 minutes.
Playing in front of a packed home crowd, Lyon dominated the quarter-final match-up but Maxence Caqueret and Gift Orban missed good chan­ces, while Said Benrahma hit the post direct from a corner.
With no extra time before the final the tie went straight to penalties, and goalkeeper Lucas Perri, a January signing by Lyon from Botafogo in his native Brazil, made himself a hero by saving Thomas Delaine’s kick, the first in the shoot-out.
Lyon converted all of their kicks, and their place in the last four was assured when Lucas Perrin put Strasb­ourg’s fifth penalty over the bar.
The shoot-out victory comes on the back of a run of seven wins in their last nine league outings under new coach Pierre Sage which has allowed Lyon to pull clear of the relegation zone.
It is the fourth time in the last six seasons in which Lyon have been in the French Cup semi-finals, but they have not reached the final since they last won the trophy in 2012.

14,"Iyer, Kishan not considered for annual BCCI contracts","NEW DELHI: Shreyas Iyer and Ishan Kishan were not considered for annual contracts for the 2023-24 season, India’s...","NEW DELHI: Shreyas Iyer and Ishan Kishan were not considered for annual contracts for the 2023-24 season, India’s cricket board (BCCI) said on Wednesday when they announced a list of 30 players who had been handed contracts.
Iyer was on a Grade B contract last year while Kishan was handed a Grade C contract but despite playing in the 50-over World Cup last year, the BCCI said both players were not considered in this round of recommendations.
Iyer was one of seven batters to score over 500 runs at the World Cup. But both Iyer and Kishan have not played for their state teams in the Ranji Trophy when they were dropped from the Indian national team.
“The BCCI has recommended that all athletes give precedence to participating in domestic cricket during periods when they are not representing the national team,” BCCI secretary Jay Shah said in a statement.
Skipper Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja have been retained in Grade A+ contracts, which were worth 70 million rupees ($844,240) last year.
“Additionally, athletes who meet the criteria of playing a minimum of three Tests or eight ODIs or 10 T20Is within the specified period will automatically be included in Grade C on a pro-rata basis,” Shah added.
“For instance, Dhruv Jurel and Sarfaraz Khan, having played two Test matches so far, will be inducted into Grade C if they participate in the Dharamsala Test match, i.e., the fifth test of the ongoing series against England.”
K.L. Rahul, Shubman Gill and Mohammed Siraj had their contracts upgraded after stellar performances, joining team-mates Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami and Hardik Pandya in the A grade, which mean an annual salary of $603,000.
Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, 22, the stand-out performer in the ongoing Test series against England, entered the list on his first BCCI central contract on grade B — a $362,000 salary.
The contract lists of four grades run from October 2023 to September 2024.
