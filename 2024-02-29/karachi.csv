• CM starts his third term in office with pledge to crush street criminals, riverine area gangs
KARACHI: Newly elected Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, who started his third term in office on Wednesday, was informed that armed robbers had killed as many as 23 citizens in Karachi during January and February.
Inspector General of Police Riffat Mukhtar revealed the harrowing statistics on street crime in Karachi at a meeting, chaired by the CM, held to review overall law and order situation in the province with a specific reference to street crime in Karachi and activities of dacoit gangs in riverine areas.
The IGP informed the CM that a total of 3,953 mobile phones were snatched at gunpoint during the first two months in the metropolis.
He said that as many as 46 cars and 1,537 motorbikes were taken away by criminals from different parts of the city during the same period.
To a question, the IGP informed the CM that incidents of street crime were high within the remit of 22 of the city’s 108 police stations.
The CM sought the list of these 22 police and asked the IGP to identify the hotspots so that special focus could be given to them.
Mr Shah directed Karachi police chief Khadim Rind to get all SSPs on the roads in the evening.
He was of the view that most cases of street crime took place after sunset so police patrolling and their presence on roads must be ensured to curb the menace.
The CM also ordered authorities to double the number of policemen at the city’s 108 police stations when he was informed that although the strength of Karachi police was 48,000 but only 12,000 law enforcers were posted at police station level.
He directed the IGP to rationalise the force deployed in other units to raise the strength at police stations from 12,000 to 24,000.
25,000 posts vacant in police
The IGP informed the CM that there were 25,000 vacant posts of policemen in the province. At this, the CM directed him to start the recruitment process purely on merit.
He said that he wanted to strengthen the investigation process. “Due to poor investigation, heinous criminals get bail and again go into their crime world,” he said and directed the IGP to arrange his meeting with investigators and prosecutors.
The chief minister said that only the police and other law enforcement agencies were authorised to use strobe lights and no other vehicle would be allowed to use them.
Taking notice of display of weapons by private security guards and personnel in plain clothes, the chief minister directed the IGP to take action against such people.
He also directed the authorities to immediately commence the Karachi Safe City project without any delay, citing the urgent need to address security threats and ensure the safety of the city.
Riverine area gangs
At the outset of the meeting, the chief minister said that the dacoits had established their sway in the riverine areas of Larkana and Sukkur divisions.
“I am not happy with the increasing trend of street crime and kidnapping for ransom in Larkana and Sukkur division,” he said.
To a question, the IGP told the CM that only 14 cases of kidnapping for ransom were unsolved.
The CM directed the IGP to work out a plan to launch a crackdown on criminal gangs in riverine area.
He said that he was waiting for the formation of a new government in Balochistan so that a joint strategy with Punjab and Balochistan could be evolved to launch a joint operation.
Rs2bn for renovation of police stations
The IGP informed the CM that 708 police stations across the province, including 108 in Karachi, were in a dilapidated condition. He requested the CM to approve funds to get all the police stations repaired.
The CM directed the finance secretary to release Rs2 billion to the police department so that affected buildings of police stations could be repaired.
During the meeting, Rangers chief Major General Azhar Waqas informed the CM that the paramilitary force was carrying out an intelligence-based targeted operation against drug mafia, terrorists and street criminals.
He said that the Rangers had been sent to the riverine area so that work on the Ghotki-Kandhkot bridge could be resumed.
Home Secretary Iqbal Memon told the CM that the work on the bridge had been started and police and Rangers have provided them with ample security.

“It is anticipated that these rains may lead to flooding in Jacobabad, Kamber Shahdadkot, Dadu and Malir districts as well as in taluka Sehawan [Jamshoro district] due to the overflow of eastern and northern catchments of Balochistan and Sindh,” said the PDMA alert.
It added that heavy rains in the provincial shared basins can result in flash flooding in natural drains and foothills. “Therefore, it is crucial that the district administrations/district disaster management authorities take proactive measures to mitigate the potential impact of these rains.”
“It is also essential to ensure safe evacuation of communities residing along natural drains and foothills to minimise the impact of any untoward situation,” it added.
Meanwhile, the Met department has forecast a sunny day for Karachi on Thursday with maximum temperature ranging between 17-19 degrees Celsius.
Temperature is likely to drop to 13-15°C on Friday (tomorrow) as the city is likely to experience intermittent thunderstorm/rain with few heavy falls.
According to the advisory, rain/thunderstorms with few heavy falls are expected in northern parts of the province from Feb 29 till March 2. Similar weather conditions are likely to prevail in the rest of the province from March 1.
“Heavy falls may generate urban flooding in low-lying areas. Fishermen of Balochistan are advised not to venture in deep sea till March 1 while those of Sindh are advised to remain careful during the forecast period,” it says.

2,Three homeless siblings sleeping on footpath run over by car in Karachi,"The car driver managed to escape from the spot in injured condition, leaving behind his vehicle that was impounded by the police.","KARACHI: Three homeless siblings were killed and two others critically injured when a fast-moving car ran over a family sleeping on a footpath near Nagan Chowrangi in the small hours of Wednesday morning, police said.
The Shahrah-i-Noor Jehan police said two brothers and their sister were killed in the accident. The car driver managed to escape from the spot in injured condition, leaving behind his vehicle that was impounded by the police.
They said Bali Gopi Chand, 22, and Ashok Gopi Chand, 9, died on the spot. Later, Shri Ram Gopi, 15, died during treatment at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.
The police said Sita Gopi, 14, and Lalay Gopi, 6, were admitted for treatment.
Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said the police had registered a manslaughter case against the driver. “The FIR has been registered and police are working on the case,” said the SSP, adding that police would arrest the driver and whoever else was in the car.
The police have invoked sections 320 (qatl-i-khata by rash or negligent driving), 337-G (hurt by rash or negligent driving) and 279 (negligent driving as to endanger human life) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Area SHO Qamar Kiani said that the police had conducted raids at three places to nab the suspect but to no avail.
He said that the case was registered on the complaint of a relative of the victims, who informed the police that he lived in the slum area of Sohrab Goth and sold vegetables on pushcart. He was asleep in his home when at around 3am someone informed him about the death of his relatives in a car accident near Nagan Chowrangi.

4,"Health experts urge govt to focus on fire prevention, safety measures",Sindh has only two public sector hospitals specialising in care for burns victims,"KARACHI: Expressing concern over the Liaquatabad government hospital tragedy that has so far claimed lives of five victims, experts have called upon the government to focus on fire prevention and safety measures, considering the high mortality risk and cost involved in treatment of burns.
They also regretted the fact that only two public sector hospitals in the whole province offered complete specialised care for burns, forcing families to move their loved ones in critical condition from the interior parts of Sindh either to Hyderabad or Karachi.
“Most victims with serious burn injuries either die on the way (while being shifted to Hyderabad or Karachi) or succumbed to their injuries during treatment,” a doctor at the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) told Dawn, wishing not to be named.
Currently, he pointed out, the CHK burns unit was attending to patients not only from the hugely populated city of Karachi but also from the interior parts of Sindh as well as Balochistan.

Sindh has only two public sector hospitals specialising in care for burns victims

“Burn victims are referred to us from Hyderabad as well, which has one dedicated facility at a major tertiary care hospital. Patients are also referred to Karachi from the Gambat Institute of Medical Sciences (in Khairpur district) as it doesn’t have equipment for skin grafting,” he explained, claiming that the CHK unit being run with the support of a non-profit organisation was well equipped and adequately staffed.
About the shifting of victims of Sindh Government Hospital Liaquatabad’s fire from CHK to a private hospital, doctors at the unit said that it had more to do with families’ discretion than lack of trust in a public sector facility.
The CHK burns unit with 65-70 bed capacity, they said, carried a big patient load at all times, making the working conditions stressful.
“It’s not humanly possible to perform 100 per cent in each and every case. Besides, it’s highly unfair (to the people) not to have a burns unit at tertiary care hospitals in other cities of the province,” another doctor shared, adding that Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fared better in this field than Sindh.
The head of the CHK burns unit declined to comment when asked to explain why families of Liaquatabad hospital fire’s victims refused to have their loved ones treated at the facility.
About the treatment cost, Dr Nizam said it’s expensive across the world, at times costlier than cancer treatment with high mortality risk.
“Patients often end up seeking financial assistance from hospitals. This explains why private hospitals avoid offering treatment for burn injuries as they find it non-viable,” he observed.
It might be recalled that a fire was reported at the Sindh Government Hospital Liaquatabad on Feb 11. Blamed on a short circuit, the fire had caused serious injuries to seven people, six of them hospital employees. All victims were shifted from CHK burns unit to Patel Hospital on families’ insistence a day later.
‘Most fire injuries are preventable’
Sources said the latest victim, 44-year-old Kashif, was a dialysis technician at the government hospital. He was a father of two girls. He had received 29pc burns in the incident.
Earlier, two paramedics, one cook and a sweeper had lost their lives during treatment at the private hospital.
“It’s sad that we have lost Kashif as he was recovering well. Unfortunately, he suddenly developed an infection that led to fatal health complications,” Dr Mazhar Nizam, representing Patel Hospital told Dawn, adding that one victim was still under treatment at the hospital.
Explaining the complications involved in the victims’ treatment, Dr Nizam said two of them were brought with 80 to 90pc burns and that survival rate was too low in cases with over 50pc burns.
“Treatment of burns is expensive across the world, at times costlier than cancer treatment with high mortality risk. Patients often end up seeking financial assistance from hospitals. This explains why private hospitals avoid offering treatment for burn injuries as they find it non-viable,” he observed.
Experts also explained that multiple factors contributed to high mortality risk in burn injuries which included the total body surface area affected, inhalation injury, age, patient’s health status and depth of the wound. In several cases, they said, death was caused not by damage to the skin but rather by lung injuries caused by toxic fumes inhaled by the victim.
“A major risk factor is infection/s. Death may also occur due to kidney failure resulting from extensive loss of fluid,” senior plastic surgeon Dr Mohammad Ashraf Ganatra said, while underscoring the need for fire prevention measures and training in fire safety given the high mortality risk and cost involved in treatment of burns.
According to him, most fire injuries reported in society could easily be prevented.
“Fire prevention at home and workplace is a subject that we must explore and create awareness about. Also, we must upgrade the existing government facilities for treatment and equip every big city in the province with a dedicated burns unit in the public sector,” he said.

5,Controversy deepens as another audio clip of MQM-P meeting surfaces,"• Spokesperson confirms clip contained Tessori’s voice

• PTI, JI say audios vindicate their stance about ‘MQM’s fake mandate’
KARACHI: The controversy surrounding release of an audio of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Mustafa Kamal at a meeting of his party’s coordination committee refused to die down as another voice clip, this time of Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, surfaced on social media platforms on Wednesday, fuelling allegations of rival parties that the MQM-P’s mandate is “fake.”
Like Mr Kamal who had admitted the contents of the audio, a spokesperson for Governor Tessori also confirmed that the audio clip contained his voice, but it was “edited” to narrate things out of context.
Governor Tessori’s audio went viral on social media and later hit the headlines of private news channels.
It appears to be recorded during a meeting of the party’s coordination committee, where Governor Tessori could be heard briefing that the MQM-P was paying the cost of leaving PTI government and becoming part of the Shehbaz Sharif-led PDM government as this had angered its voters. “The MQM-P got seven seats despite all the hurdles [in 2018] which was our vote bank. We didn’t get the vote today [in the 2024 elections].
In the same audio, the governor informed the coordination committee that the PML-N had offered only one ministry — science and technology — and they also wanted to bring their own governor in Sindh.
Also, Governor Tessori, according to the audio, told the coordination committee that the PPP was pressurising the PML-N against the MQM-P.


Mustafa Kamal

 
Earlier on Tuesday, an audio clip of Mr Kamal went viral in which he could be heard briefing the coordination committee about MQM-P’s talks with the PML-N and that the PPP had told the ‘N’ league that the mandate of MQM-P was “100 per cent fake”; whereas mandate of other parties was “50-60pc fake”.
Later, in a video statement, Mr Kamal said that “a mole of MQM-London” in the MQM-P coordination committee had released the audio tape.
However, there was no word about the identity of the person who had recorded the audios and leaked it.
PTI, JI reactions to audio leaks
Already protesting against the alleged rigging in the Feb 8 elections, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) got another opportunity to hammer their narrative over audio leaks.
In his reaction to the two audio clips, PTI-Sindh president Haleem Adil Sheikh, said: “Now it has been more than two weeks and the parties who were declared winners in the elections aren’t ready to accept that it’s a reality.”
“The MQM-P is like a salesman who’s selling stolen goods. Because every buyer knows they’re selling the stolen goods, no one is ready to buy them. The MQM-P, PML-N and PPP know very well that their mandate is not because of people’s votes but because of rigging, manipulation and dishonesty of people at the helm of affairs,” he added.
JI-Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman went a step forward.
“After audio leaks of Mustafa Kamal and Sindh governor, the Election Commission of Pakistan has no excuse left to justify the results of Feb 8 elections. Now it’s an open and shut case,” he said in a statement.
“The ECP should immediately declare the results announced under Form-47s null and void and recompile the results in line with the Form-45s,” he added.
“Now it’s high time for Mr Tessori to come forward, become approver and share the truth with people as to how a rejected party was imposed on Karachi and Hyderabad,” he added.
The MQM-P, he said, had failed to win from even a single polling station out of total 5,500 set up across the city on Feb 8.

6,SHC restrains private school from operating in Clifton house,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday restrained the management of a private school from operating in a...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday restrained the management of a private school from operating in a residential property in Clifton.
A single-judge bench headed by Justice Agha Faisal observed that property in question could not be used for any purpose other than residential till the final disposal of the lawsuit.
Some residents of the area had filed a suit and stated that the Lyceum School was operating in a residential property on Hatim Alvi Road in Old Clifton.
The plaintiffs pleaded for a restraining order for defendants from utilising the subject property as their school till the final adjudication of the matter.
In its comments, the Sindh Building Control Authority stated that the property in question was residential and a commercial school was operating illegally.
Representing the plaintiffs, Advocate Arshad Tayebaly submitted that the property in question was admittedly being used for an illegal purpose and such illegality could not be afforded legal sanction in the garb of denial of interim relief.
He also submitted that a commercial school with 700 to 800 students was a grave nuisance, inconvenience and anathema to a residential locale.
Advocate Faisal Siddiqi appeared on the behalf of the school management and argued that while prima facie a case was undeniably set forth by the plaintiffs, the scales to the extent of balance of convenience and irreparable harm were tilted in favour of the contesting defendants.
He also maintained that the commercial school was operating at the suit property since long and the efflux of time, coupled with interests of third parties, entitled the private commercial school to continue to operate; at least until a decision upon their regularisation application was rendered.
The bench in its order said the lawyer for plaintiffs had demonstrated a prima facie case, favourable balance of convenience and finally that irreparable harm would continue unless the application was allowed and thus, a fit case for interim injunctive relief was set forth.
“Therefore, CMA 6921 of 2018 is allowed and the defendants are restrained from using the suit property, being Plot 78 Hatim Alvi Road Old Clifton Karachi, and / or permitting the use thereof, for any purpose other than residential and restrained from using, and / or permitting the use thereof, the same for a school, until final disposal of the suit,” it concluded.

8,Two college students held for aerial firing,They said that raids were being conducted for the arrest of other suspects.,"KARACHI: Police claimed to have arrested two college students for their alleged involvement in carrying out aerial firing on Seaview on Wednesday.
They said that students of different educational institutes gathered at DHA Phase VIII at around 10am, where some students carried out aerial firing with automatic weapons.
The police claimed to have arrested Bilal Akhund and Jabber Khan and registered an FIR at the Sahil police station.
They said that raids were being conducted for the arrest of other suspects.
The police said that there was a strict ban on display of weapons and aerial firing and the students had triggered fear and panic among the people by resorting to firing.

DIG-South Syed Asad Raza said that current and former students of famous private colleges in DHA had been arranging a “batch bunk” event for the last 10 years.
He said they had created a WhatsApp group and around 1,000 students were its members.
A case was registered on behalf of state under Sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 337-H (ii) (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent act), 277 (fouling water of public spring or reservoir) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, the policemen were performing their duty in the area when they heard the sound of firing at around 10:20am. They rushed to main Abdul Sattar Avenue at Seaview where they saw people wearing uniform of colleges were carrying out aerial firing with automatic weapons.
It said that the police noted number plates of several vehicles and the people present there informed them that they were all students, who managed to escape.

“Mr Zardari is currently busy in Islamabad. He will provide his input [about the cabinet] when he gets free,” Murad said while talking to media persons outside the mausoleum of the Father of the Nation, Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, on Wednesday.
Accompanied by Sindh Assembly Speaker Awais Qadir Shah, Deputy Speaker Naveed Anthony, MPAs Saeed Ghani, Mukesh Chawla, Sadia Javed and others, the chief minister laid wreath at the grave and offered fateha.
Mr Shah said that the first thing he would do would be implementation of the 10-point election manifesto of his chairman for which he was mobilising all the departments concerned of his government.
“Work on most of the points on the manifesto had already been started by his previous government in selected districts and he will now expand their scope to the entire province,” he said.
Mr Shah thanked the party leadership for reposing their trust in him by making him chief minister for the third time in a row and said that law and order conditions had greatly improved as compared to 2018 after he had taken a number of tangible measures to strengthen police, empowered the force with necessary weapons, equipment and gadgets and boosted their confidence by raising their salaries and other benefits.
He said that he gave top priority to rule of law. In view of forecast for heavy rains in the province he had issued necessary instructions to all civic agencies and local bodies, he said.
Earlier, the chief minister flew to Larkana where he paid respects to PPP founder leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and his slain daughter Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto by laying wreaths and offering fateha at their graves in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Bhutto village. He also offered fateha at the graves of Begum Nusrat Bhutto, Mir Murtaza Bhutto and Shahnawaz Bhutto.
Talking to journalists outside the mausoleum, he said that Asif Ali Zardari, too, would visit Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Bhutto after taking oath as President of Pakistan. “We have to devote our energies to the rehabilitation of flood-affected people. I shall try my level best to live up to peoples’ expectations,” he said.
He said in answer to a question about police failure to arrest killers of journalist Jan Mohammad Mahar: “We will not sit idle till the arrest of Mahar’s killers.”
He prayed for ASI Sultan Shah and others who were killed during election and announced paying compensation and a job to the ASI’s heir.
The chief minister flew to Sehwan from Larkana where he visited ancestral graveyard in his native village, Wahur, and offered fateha at the graves of his parents. Thereafter, he arrived at the shrine of Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sehwan, laid wreath on the grave and reviewed arrangements for the urs.
He told journalists outside the shrine that the remaining ministries in federal government needed to be devolved and elite-specific subsidies were required to be discontinued.

More than a dozen elders in attendance at the meeting said that the drugs, ranging from mild intoxicants like gutka and mainpuri to stronger ones like bhang, cannabis and hashish, were being sold openly in their area.
They lamented that the menace had ruined almost every household. From young children to the old everyone was affected by the drugs one way or the other, they said, adding the drug addiction had also led to an increase in street crimes and other social evils.
Khamiso Wadho, president of the association, said: “Our patience is wearing thin. We can no more live with this evil which is hollowing out our present generation as well as the coming generation”.
Noor Mohammad Abro, an elder, said that unfortunately, drug pushers and dealers were their own people and they were selling drugs to earn easy money without much hard work. A handful of families were getting rich by living off lives of hundreds of families, which was unacceptable and inhuman, they said.
Mohammad Urs, Mubeen Dars, Suresh Kumar and others regretted that instead of stopping proliferation of drugs, law enforcement agencies and administration looked the other way.
The village council warned that if the administration failed to eradicate drugs from their area, they would not allow polio teams to vaccinate their children.
211 refusal cases
A total of 211 refusal cases were reported in the district during the past two days of the anti-polio campaign launched on Feb 26 and scheduled to end on March 1 (tomorrow).
However, 79 of them were later persuaded to allow their children to be vaccinated under property security arrangements.
Sources said that in the past, seven refusal cases were reported in the district, five of them belonged to Sindhri taluka.
When contacted, concerned focal person Dr Naraindas told this reporter that they had target to administer anti-polio drops to 340,000 children under five. So far they had achieved 51.5 per cent target in two days of the campaign, he said.

The family of the victim said that Naeem Ahmed Babar was kidnapped on his way home from Naparkot area.
They alleged that the kidnappers belonged to the Nasirani clan and they had abducted the officer in retaliation as police were conducting an operation against them [criminals belonging to the Nasirani clan].
The family claimed that the kidnappers had demanded release of their arrested associates, including women, in exchange for the polio team officer.
The Babar’s family members and supporters staged a demonstration and demanded the district police rescue the hostage from the clutches of the outlaws.
Sources said the abduction had created difficulties for the district administration to reassure polio teams of security.

They were speaking at the second international conference titled “Consequences of environmental degradation, natural disasters, socio-economic & governance challenges for Sindh, Pakistan and way forward” organised by the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Sindh, which concluded in Jamshoro the other day.
The recommendations prepared on the basis of research papers read out at the moot urged development and implementation of integrated climate resilience plans for addressing specific challenges posed by climate change in Sindh.
The plans should incorporate climate change projections, vulnerability assessments and adaptation strategies across various sectors, including agriculture, water management, infrastructure and urban planning.
The moot emphasised the importance of mainstreaming climate resilience into development policies and said that plans and investments should build adaptive capacity and reduce vulnerability to climate-related disasters.
It said there should be investment in development alongside deployment of advanced meteorological and hydrological monitoring systems as well as community-based early warning networks to provide timely and accurate warnings of extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts and cyclones.
It stressed the need for launching public awareness campaigns and capacity-building initiatives to ensure that communities were adequately prepared to respond to climate-related disasters.
It called for promotion of ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches to enhance climate resilience and reduction in impact of climate change in the country.
It recommended supporting conservation, restoration and sustainable management of ecosystems, such as mangroves, wetlands and forests, which provided natural buffers against climate-related hazards, regulated water flow and supported biodiversity.
The moot advocated the integration of EbA measures into disaster risk reduction strategies, land use planning and development projects to enhance ecosystem resilience and ecosystem-based livelihoods.
The experts advised to encourage the adoption of climate-smart agriculture and water management practices to build resilience against climate change impacts on agriculture and water resources in Sindh and Pakistan.
They agreed to promote sustainable agricultural practices, such as crop diversification, agro-forestry and soil conservation that enhanced productivity, conserved water and mitigated greenhouse gas emissions.
They recommended supporting the development and implementation of climate-resilient irrigation systems, water-harvesting techniques and drought management strategies to improve water security and agricultural resilience in the face of climate variability and change.
They termed capacity-building and knowledge-sharing indispensable and said there should be investment in strengthening resilience of communities, government agencies, and civil society organisations to climate change impacts in the country.
They recommended providing training and technical assistance on climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and sustainable development practices to enhance local capacities for climate resilience planning, implementation and monitoring.
They agreed to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange among stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, practitioners and community leaders to facilitate learning, innovation and best practices in climate change adaptation and disaster management.
On ecosystem restoration and conservation, they recommended advocating comprehensive ecosystem restoration and conservation initiatives in Sindh to mitigate the impacts of environmental degradation and enhance resilience to natural disasters.
They advised rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems, such as forests, wetlands and mangroves to restore their ecological functions, biodiversity and ecosystem services.
They said that support of community-based conservation efforts and sustainable land management practices were necessary to contribute to ecosystem resilience and reduce vulnerability to disasters.
The conference called for integrated water resource management approaches that addressed the challenges of water scarcity, pollution and unsustainable water use in the country.
The moot was presided over by vice chancellor of Sindh University. Dr Niaz Ahmed Bhutto, Dr Pasand Ali Khoso, Dr Abdul Razaque Channa, Prof Khaleeque Mahesar, Dr Ameer Ali Abro, Dr Mohammad Younis Leghari and many national and international researchers hailing from the USA, the UK, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Egypt and other countries also attended the concluding ceremony.
