1,K-P govt’s secret tax move stirs backlash,Business community cries foul as caretakers slap 2% cess on all imports into province,"Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Caretaker government has imposed two per cent Infrastructure Development Cess on all the merchandise imported into the province.
Official sources told The Express Tribune that the proposal for the tax was under consideration for past few years and in the past it was suggested that it should be levied on the Afghan refugees and it should be used for infrastructure development in the province.
However, this proposal was turned down and now the caretaker government has silently imposed it. A formal notification has also been issued by the finance department.
On the other hand, the business community in K-P, represented by the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa chapter and various city chambers across the province, vehemently opposes the recently announced 2 per cent Cess on essential commodities. 
This tax, determined by the prices of goods, is seen as a potential catalyst for a new wave of inflation.
Key representatives of the business community have united in calling for the immediate withdrawal of the Finance Department’s notification to prevent adverse economic consequences.
Regional In-charge FPCCI in K-P, Haji Muhammad Afzal, and Coordinator Muhammad Akbar Khan expressed deep concern over the impact of the tax on businesses.
