0,"JUI-F, ANP shun elections of top offices",MQM-P noncommittal on voting for Zardari," 
The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and the Awami National Party (ANP) on Thursday announced that they would boycott the election process for the prime minister, president, speaker and deputy speaker.

The JUI-F also disclosed its plan to sit on the opposition benches.

Sources revealed that the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) was also not willing to participate in the elections for the president and the Senate chairman until its demands were met.

Speaking to the media at the Parliament House, Fazl asserted his skepticism regarding the new government's ability to complete its five-year term.

When questioned about his party's stance on joining the PTI protest or initiating their own protest movement, he responded: “Wait and watch. We will protest alongside you.”

Fazl was among the newly elected members to take oath on Thursday during the inaugural session of the 16th National Assembly.

He said he considered parliament “more representative of establishment than the people”.

“We will sit in the opposition. We will not become part of the voting process for president, National Assembly speaker and prime minister,” he said.

Speaking sarcastically, he said, “It is not an assembly but something else.”

He said the JUI-F’s policy dictated that they would not vote for anyone in the house, adding that the party would not participate in further proceedings of parliament.

Earlier, the JUI-F chief warned of a potential “system collapse” in the country, citing “excessive interference from the powers that be” as the primary cause.

Meanwhile, the ANP also decided to refrain from participating in the parliamentary elections.


In a statement on Thursday, ANP leader Asfandary Wali Khan maintained that their members would refrain from participating in the election process of any assembly as well as the Senate.

He emphasised his party’s commitment to civilian supremacy, democracy, and strengthening of parliament in the country.
He expressed concern about the “unprecedented use of money in the recent elections”, stating that the ANP was not inclined to cast votes in the provincial assemblies and the Senate under the current circumstances.

Asfandyar said the ANP was offered positions by the current majority parties, but they did not engage in politics focused on power and seats.

He reiterated the ANP's principled stance, advocating for the retrieval of the mandate from “mandate thieves” and its rightful allocation to “true representatives”.

Asfandyar stated that further decisions regarding their role in parliament would be made through mutual consultation later.
Separately, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Thursday agreed to support the coalition government in electing the National Assembly speaker and deputy speaker, as well as the prime minister.

The MQM-P was expected to hold a final round of negotiations with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) before taking its decision about joining the coalition government, according to party sources.

According to sources, the PML-N is ready to give only one ministry to the MQM-P while it is demanding four ministries. They said the MQM-P also wanted to allow Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori to continue on the post, otherwise, according to some sources, the party would prefer to sit on the opposition benches.

However, MQM-P’s Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said that the party had affirmed its support in exchange for the National Finance Commission Award to be fairly distributed in “every district and to every local body”.

The development came during a meeting between the MQM-P leaders and members of a delegation, including Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Aleem Khan, Sadiq Sanjrani, Yusuf Raza Gillani, Khursheed Shah and Khalid Magsi.

Speaking to the media outside the Parliament House, Sadiq said that his party, PPP, Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party and Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid met with MQM-P’s Siddiqui.

“We asked them for their vote for [the election of] NA speaker and deputy speaker, the prime minister and the president,” he said.

Sadiq said that the MQM-P had assured the delegation of casting its vote in their favour for the NA speaker and deputy speaker, and the prime minister.

“We will come to them again for the vote for [the election of] the president and the Senate chairman,” he said.
Sadiq said that the PML-N would work on the MQM-P’s demand for a constitutional amendment regarding the distribution of the NFC Award.

Meanwhile, addressing media persons, Siddiqui said that they made this request “keeping in view the people’s rights in the Constitution” and they wanted “a place for those rights in the Constitution”.

“Democracy is the only way forward in Pakistan,” Siddiqui added, emphasising that the people should participate for democracy to take root in the country.

“The party's focus is not on governorship or ministries, but on delivering benefits of democracy.”
Siddiqui clarified that decisions regarding cabinet positions had been finalised, but the party had not sought any specific roles.

In various media interviews, MQM-P Senior Deputy Convener Dr Farooq Sattar and newly elected National Assembly member (MNA) Mustafa Kamal both expressed their optimism about the ongoing coalition talks with the PML-N, hoping to reach consensus on all issues very soon.

“Kamran Tessori is the MQM’s choice for the governor’s post,” Sattar told a private TV channel in an interview.
Regarding the ongoing discussions with the PML-N on forming the coalition, he expressed his optimism about reaching a consensus soon.

Despite the challenges in joining the government, Sattar affirmed the MQM-P's dedication to political stability and national progress, pledging cooperation wherever necessary. He highlighted the PML-N's recognition of the MQM's pivotal role in parliamentary politics and its status as an important ally.

Kamal said, “The cabinet will come after that [the oath-taking by the elected members].”

He said, “The procedure is being processed and both the parties are moving in the right direction. There is no deadlock.”

However, sources maintained that the MQM-P was ready to cast its vote in the election of National Assembly speaker and prime minister. However, the party was not willing to vote in the election of Senate chairman and president.

Meanwhile, Balochistan National Party (BNP) leader Akhtar Mengal decided to sit on the independent benches.

1,First NA session marred by ruckus,Outgoing speaker administers oath to 302 newly elected lawmakers,"Amid rigging allegations and uncertainty surrounding the political dispensation, the process of formation of the new federal government kicked off on Thursday when 302 out of the 336 newly elected lawmakers were sworn in at the inaugural session of the 16th National Assembly.

The maiden session witnessed the return of two major players of the political chessboard in parliament: PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif -- who re-entered the assembly hall after a gap of seven years -- and PTI lawmakers entering the NA under the banner of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) after they had abandoned the lower house by resigning en masse in April 2022.

Though PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan is in jail, his party’s lawmakers winning in the general elections made his presence felt by chanting slogans in his favour and wearing his lookalike face masks.

Amid the ruckus, an Imran-lookalike mask was also thrown at Nawaz, when he was signing on the Roll of Members after being sworn in.

Perhaps, the SIC lawmakers took the inspiration from Netflix’s blockbuster Spanish crime series ‘Money Heist’, which featured lead characters wearing face masks designed by Spanish artist Salvador Dali.

The only other uncanny resemblance and uniqueness between Dali and Imran is that they are unapologetically themselves, even when they are wrong.

Although, the maiden session was marred by ruckus and slogans in favour of Imran and Nawaz, outgoing NA Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf announced that the elections for his successor and their deputy would take place on Friday (today).

PML-N’s Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and PTI-backed Amir Dogar submitted their nomination papers for the post of the speaker to the NA Secretariat.

Similarly, PPP’s Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah and PTI-SIC’s Junaid Akbar submitted their papers for the post of the deputy speaker to the secretariat.

Later, the assembly secretariat announced that the election for the slot of prime minister will take place on March 3 (Sunday), ending the guessing game as to when the country would have a new premier.

Earlier, it was expected that the election for the post of the PM might take place coming Monday.

Soon after the election, the premier will go to the Presidency to take oath of his office and then take charge of the PM Office.

Ironically, it seemed the PTI-SIC lawmakers started off the new parliamentary year where they had left it in April 2022: the slogan of “Chor (thieves), Corrupt and Ghaddar (traitors)”.

The PTI lawmakers had resigned en masse in April 2022 after Imran was ousted from the post of the premier through a vote of no confidence and minutes before PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif replaced him.

Once again, as the irony would have it, Shehbaz is set to become the next premier.

From the start till the end, the assembly hall kept echoing with slogans of “Dekho Dekho Kaun Aaya, Sher Aaya Sher Aaya (look who has come, the tiger has come)” and “Kaun Bachaye Ga Pakistan, Imran Khan Imran Khan (who will save Pakistan, Imran Khan Imran Khan)”.

At times, it was difficult to distinguish who was responding to which slogan line and it felt like Nawaz and Imran were both the ‘tiger’ and the ‘saviour’.

The SIC lawmakers also chanted the slogan of “Prisoner No 804” -- the number allotted to Imran after he was convicted in the Toshakhana (gift repository) case and sent to jail.

Nevertheless, the PTI under the guise of the SIC has returned to parliament.

There is an unspoken ban on mentioning Imran’s name and displaying his photo or video. However, this was the first time that the PTI received the chance to mention his name and show his photos on television screens – perhaps a small reward for returning to parliament.

Dogar, who served as the PTI’s chief whip in the previous stint, not just signed on the register for lawmakers’ attendance on the Roll of Members in connection with Rule No 7 of the Rules and Procedure of National Assembly, 2007, but also chanted slogans in favour of Imran and his party while standing near the NA speaker’s podium.

As the session began, the lawmakers on both sides of the aisle appeared to be fully charged as they shouted slogans against each other.

The PTI lawmakers, sitting on the opposition benches, came prepared and almost all of them had brought Imran’s posters with them.

The lawmakers, sitting on the treasury benches, were seen short of posters or placards of Nawaz and other party leaders and had no other option but to keep chanting slogans as hard as they could.

As the bigwigs left the assembly hall, the members were busy signing the register and completing the formalities. A member, who arrived late, was sworn in separately.

Apart from Nawaz, the maiden session witnessed the presence of prime minister in-waiting Shehbaz, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, Ishaq Dar, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, and JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman among others.

Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Omar Ayub, Sardar Latif Khosa, Sher Afzal Marwat, Shandana Gulzar, Shehryar Afridi and other PTI leaders, who have now merged with the SIC, were also in attendance.

The NA speaker administered the oath to the newly elected members.

After the oath was administered, the lawmakers signed on the register marking the lawmakers’ attendance on the Role of Members as per Rule No 7 of the Rules and Procedure of National Assembly, 2007.

The Rule 7 reads: “There shall be a Roll of Members which shall be signed by every member after making the oath.”

During the session, the PTI-SIC’s candidate for premiership, Omar Ayub, said the house was incomplete, adding that even the people nominated for the reserved seats could not arrive to take oath during the inaugural session.

In response to Ayub and Gohar’s arguments that the SIC was deprived of the reserved seats, PML-N’s Khawaja Asif said the SIC had not even submitted its list for the reserved seats to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) before the polls. He asked how could the SIC be granted the reserved seats then.

Seeing the unruly behaviour of the lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, the speaker adjourned the session till 10am on Friday.

On Friday, as per the agenda issued by the NA Secretariat, oath will be administered to those who could not take it on Thursday.

After that, the election for the new NA speaker will be held.

Subsequently, the new speaker will take oath and the election for the deputy speaker will be conducted, followed by their swearing-in.

2,K-P Assembly sworn in amid chaos,Balochistan speaker Jan Jamali skips inaugural session; Achakzai administers oath to 57 MPAs,"A tumultuous atmosphere engulfed the inaugural sessions of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Balochistan assemblies on Wednesday as newly-elected members braved chaotic scenes to take their oaths of office.
Disorder reigned the K-P Assembly as each provincial assembly member (MPA) brought along dozens of guests, leading to the breach of a gate and broken windowpanes amid feeble security attempts.
The session, chaired by K-P Speaker Mushtaq Ghani and starting nearly two hours behind schedule, witnessed the swearing-in of 116 MPAs amid a rowdy assembly.
The inaugural session in K-P, overseen by Speaker Mushtaq Ghani, commenced almost two hours behind schedule. Speaker Ghani then proceeded to administer the oath to 116 MPAs.
Conversely, in the Balochistan Assembly, the responsibility of administering oaths to 57 MPAs fell upon the newly-elected representative, Zamarak Achakzai of the Awami National Party (ANP).
In the K-P Assembly, a woman legislator from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) stumbled.
Sobia Shahid of the PML-N entered the assembly hall carrying a wristwatch, where she made jest of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MPAs, alluding to the conviction of the party founder in the Toshakhana case.
As Shahid approached the speaker’s podium, brandishing the wristwatch in her hand, PTI supporters hurled a water pot (Lota), empty bottles, and shoes at her.
Nevertheless, she seized the water pot and positioned it on the leader of the house's chair, proceeding to occupy the opposition leader's seat herself.
Meanwhile, PTI workers in the assembly gallery vociferously chanted slogans. The session, initially slated for an 11 am commencement, kicked off at 1.30 pm.

Speaker Ghani called for silence in the hall and initiated the proceedings of the inaugural session.
At the outset of the session, prayers were offered for the late father of Ali Amin Gandapur, the PTI nominee for the post of provincial chief minister, and the martyrs, who lost lives in the war against terrorism. Later, he administered the oath to 116 newly elected members of the assembly.
Previously, a large number of guests and PTI workers entered the assembly hall, accompanying the newly-elected MPAs. The volume was so significant that all the security arrangements designated for the inaugural session faltered.
Outside the assembly hall, security personnel had sealed all the doors to deter any rush. Consequently, dozens of MPAs had to endure a prolonged wait to enter the building.
PTI workers accessed the assembly hall by breaking the windowpanes of the kitchen. Notably, even two sons of Speaker Ghani used that route.
The newly-elected MPAs, who took oath on Wednesday, included 115 elected on the general seats and five on the reserved seats. The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has not yet been notified of the results of the Shangla and Torghar seats.
Following the oath-taking, Speaker Mushtaq Ahmed Ghani extended congratulations to the new members and adjourned the meeting until Thursday morning.
The assembly would now proceed to elect a new speaker and deputy speaker before the chief minister's election.
The PTI had nominated Gandapur as its candidate for the position of chief minister. Hasham Inamullah Khan of the PML-N had been proposed for the role of chief minister by other parties, anticipated to form the opposition.
Dr Abad of the PML-N has been selected as the nominee for the position of opposition leader.
The opposition parties have unanimously decided to nominate Ehsanullah Miankhel, for the post of speaker, and Arbab Waqas of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-Parliamentarians (PTI-P) for the post of deputy speaker.
 
Balochistan
In Quetta, 57 newly-elected Balochistan MPAs were administered the oath of office. Speaker Jan Muhammad Jamali did not attend the inaugural session and in his place, Achakzai chaired the proceedings and administered the oath.
The session took place under stringent security measures, with all roads leading to the Balochistan Assembly closed to traffic.
At the outset of the session, lawmakers offered Fateha for those who lost their lives in the Khanozai and Killa Saifullah bombings preceding the general elections.
Most of the MPAs from the PPP and the PML-N were present in the house, including Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, Mir Sadiq Umrani, Mir Zahoor Buledi, Asfandyar Khan Kakar and others. The visitors’ gallery was also jam-packed with guests and supporters of the new MPAs.
Those who were sworn in on Wednesday, included National Party (NP) chief Dr Malik Baloch, Aslam Raisani of the Jamiat ul Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), Abdul Majeed Badini of the Jamaat e Islami (JI) and Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, the chief of the Haq Do Tehreek, Gwadar.
The session was adjourned until Thursday, for the election of the speaker and the deputy speaker.
PPP has nominated Ghazala Gola for the post of deputy speaker, whereas, the PML-N is likely to nominate Captain (retd) Khaliq Achakzai for the speakership.
Meanwhile, a four-party alliance, consisting of the NP, Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), and the Hazara Democratic Party (HDP) staged protest demonstrations in the city against the alleged poll rigging.
“We reject these engineered elections”, Ghulam Nabi Marri of the BNP said. “Masses of Balochistan have rejected these engineered elections,” he claimed. “People of the province would not accept these elections”, added Qahar Wadan, the provincial chief of the PkMAP.

3,PML-N has cabinet surprises up its sleeve,Several names shortlisted for key slots; foreign ministry may be kept vacant for Bilawal,"As the process of the formation of the new federal government will kick off from Thursday (today) with the inaugural session of the National Assembly, Shehbaz Sharif, the PML-N president and prime minister-in-waiting, is engaged with the party leadership to finalise his cabinet.
The party is tight-lipped, but insiders told The Express Tribune on Wednesday that several names had been shortlisted for the key cabinet slots.
The first batch of ministers will be sworn in the moment Shehbaz takes charge as the premier next week.
As the PML-N, PPP and MQM-P have the required number, Shehbaz's election as the next premier is a foregone conclusion.
Given that the PPP will not join the cabinet to begin with, many other ministers will likely be allotted more than one portfolio.
The move is aimed at leaving the option open for the PPP to join the cabinet later.
Although there is no official confirmation yet, sources said it was likely that PML-N’s Attaullah Tarar would be appointed as the federal information minister.
The outspoken PML-N leader defeated PPP co-chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in the race for a Lahore NA seat.
Rana Sanaullah, who lost the polls, may return as the interior minister after being elected as a senator or winning an NA slot in the by-polls for the seats to be vacated by those who emerged victorious in more than one constituency.
There is no clarity yet about who will take the most crucial ministry of finance given the enormous economic challenges faced by the country.
The veteran Ishaq Dar is still in contention but there is opposition to his appointment both from outside and some from within the party.
Some sources claimed that Dar could be appointed as the foreign minister given his close relationship with PML-N supremo and three-time former premier Nawaz Sharif.
They added that as Pakistan needed financial support from its usual friends including Saudi Arabia, the UAE and China, Dar as the potential foreign minister could play a crucial role.
As he has been dealing with these countries as the finance minister, Dar, if given the portfolio of the foreign ministry, can use his experience to help secure funds for the government.
Khawaja Asif is another potential candidate for the post of the foreign minister.
However, the sources said these were proposals at this stage and the final list of ministers might look different.
Another option is to keep the post of the foreign minister vacant and instead appoint either an adviser or special assistant.
Syed Tariq Fatemi, a former diplomat and long-term aide of Nawaz, may be assigned that position.
The idea is mooted to hand over the post to Bilawal if the PPP decides to join the cabinet.
Bilawal served as the foreign minister for 16 months during the previous coalition government.
The sources said the PML-N would finalise the names in the next few days and also decide which ministries would be given to the MQM-P.
