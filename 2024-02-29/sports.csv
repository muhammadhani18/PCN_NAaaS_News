The uproar stemmed from a Batch Bunk gathering organized by college students in DHA Phase VIII, where attendees brazenly brandished firearms and indulged in irresponsible behavior.

5,"Leaked audios: After Kamal, Tessori admits MQM-P’s poll ‘setback’","Our situation is going to be even worse if we join govt, Sindh governor can be heard as saying","Following the recent revelation of a leaked audio featuring Mustafa Kamal, another audio surfaced on Wednesday, this time involving Sindh Governor and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Kamran Tessori. In the recording, Tessori purportedly admits that the party did not secure the expected votes in the 2024 elections.
In the leaked audio, Tessori can be heard expressing concern about the party’s position if they were to join the government, stating, “Our situation is going to be even worse. We did not get votes in the elections.” He highlighted the 2024 results in contrast with the 2018 elections when MQM-P secured seven seats, which was considered their actual vote bank.
Tessori went on to reveal the party’s past alliance with PTI, expressing that joining the upcoming government would be detrimental to the party’s standing in the populace. He disclosed that the MQM-P’s support for the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a coalition mainly consisting of PPP and PML-N, angered their voters.
“If we join the government, then our situation is going to be worse,” Tessori lamented in the purported audio. He added, “they are bringing in a Sindh governor of their own… in return for joining the government, they are only giving us the Ministry of Science and Technology.”
This revelation comes on the heels of another audio leak featuring MQM-P leader Mustafa Kamal, where discussions about a potential coalition government with PML-N were detailed. Kamal described an uncooperative attitude from PML-N during negotiations, alleging that PPP accused MQM-P of a completely fraudulent mandate.

8,Mayor starts road repairs with discretionary funds,HMC Works and Services Dept officials elude inquiry over poor construction of roads,"Some of the roads built, rehabilitated or widened in Hyderabad a year or two ago, have developed potholes, bumps and holistically a bad road surface. 
Mayor Kashif Ali Shoro in October, 2023, had written to Works and Services Department to conduct inquiry which was supposed to be followed by urgent repair works. However, after failing to elicit a response from the officers of the department concerned, the mayor has ordered patchwork on these roads this week from his own funds.
The mayor had sought probe over three specific roads. One of these roads is a dual carriageway - Naseem Nagar Road in Qasimabad - with flourishing markets on its either sides. The other two roads connect thickly populated residential areas with a main road which connects Hyderabad with Jamshoro district. These roads became damaged some months after completion of the civil works.
On Mayor's prodding, a week later Deputy Commissioner Tariq Qureshi also asked the department's executive engineer (XEn) in Hyderabad to start an inquiry. Subsequently, Director General Monitoring Works and Services Department on December 4, 2023, asked the XEn for the inquiry on an urgent basis, giving reference of the mayor's correspondence.

He asked the XEn to provide details like PC-I, administrative approval, work orders, technical sanctions, released bills and incumbency of the officers during whose stints those projects were executed. ""The requisite documents with attested photocopies were required by this office but you failed to submit the same,"" the DG wrote in another correspondence over two months later on February 9.
On February 21, the DC once again raised the same issue in writing with the XEn. ""The XEn has completely ignored all directions to conduct inquiry over the poor construction works on these roads,"" the mayor said in a statement on Wednesday.
In 2022, a wide green belt on Naseem Nagar road was razed so that the dual carriageway could be widened. With the belt, the road with dozens of commercial plazas and tens of housing schemes became shorn of its entire green cover. The mayor also started a tree plantation drive on this road on February 26.

Acknowledging challenges in riverine areas, Shah called for a targeted operation against dacoits and drug mafias in Larkana and Sukkur divisions. He urged a concerted effort to control kidnapping for ransom and curb criminal influence. In collaboration with law enforcement officials, including the Inspector General of Police (IG), efforts were directed towards enhancing police visibility, with special focus on evening patrols to deter street crimes.

He stressed the need for specialized training for traffic police to manage congestion effectively amid ongoing development projects. Additionally, stringent measures were proposed to regulate the use of strobe lights on vehicles, ensuring law enforcement exclusivity.
Concerning security in riverine areas, plans for a joint operation with neighboring provinces were discussed to counter cross-border criminal activities. Shah emphasized the revival of defunct police stations in vulnerable areas and announced plans for a comprehensive crackdown.
Stringent regulations were imposed on the public display of arms, with directives to strengthen the investigation process to prevent criminals from evading justice. Initiatives such as the Karachi Safe City project were expedited to bolster surveillance capabilities and ensure public safety.
