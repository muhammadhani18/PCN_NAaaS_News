Patrons of art, Ahmed Habib, Saima Amir and Zarar Haider Babri were called upon to serve as judges in the competition. Assistant Commissioner Coordination, Shabana Nazir was the chief guest at the prize distribution ceremony.
Speaking at the event, Shabana said “Like poetry, painting is also a result of human feelings. What a poet does is what a painter does. Poet with tongue, painter with pencil or pen. Painting is also a pictorial language that has been spoken in all ages.” Finally, the chief guest congratulated the Arts Council for organising the painting competition.
Arts Council Director Waqar Ahmed said that painting is the oldest art in the world. “Painting has a very high place in history. It not only reflects the cultural, social and religious conditions but it can also accurately predict the impact of economic fluctuations. Painting also plays an important role in evaluating the civilization of nations,” he said.

1,Career fair draws eager pupils,Event features an array of organisations hunting for fresh talent,"The annual career fair aimed at undergraduate and graduate students of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) was held at its H-12 campus.
The event was a major affair with more than 40 organisations in attendance seeking to hire budding talent from one of the top universities in the country. The different companies at the fair included both public and private companies, and international organisations as well.
Multinational conglomerates and business insight providers such as S&P global, Insights Driven Research (IDR) were present at the fair to primarily recruit marketing and business graduates. Some policy groups, social organisations, educational initiatives like Teach for Pakistan and Taleemabad were also present.
However, the overwhelming majority of organisations present belonged to the telecommunication and tech sector seeking to engage with the university’s engineering student body. These included the likes of Nayatel, Nayapay, all major network providers of the country and many others.
The ground where the career fair was held was teeming with students throughout the day as undergraduate students approached various organisations to learn more about their prospects, look for summer internships and drop off their CVs. Meanwhile, graduate students and those with professional skills already in the bag sought job openings.
However, most organisations at the event were specifically present to market their brands and offer programmes for young, inexperienced students who were about to graduate, such as internships, fast-track and management trainee programmes.
“The turnout was great. I was surprised to see some students coming back to our booth multiple times. They seemed very excited,” said one representative of an organisation present at the fair.

3,Two killed in drive-by shooting,The victims have been identified as Tanveer and Bilal,"At least two people were killed in a drive-by shooting incident in the Niazi Town area within the limits of Rawalpindi’s Race Course Police Station.
CCTV footage of the daylight attack has gone viral on social media. In the CCTV footage, it can be seen that the accused shot and killed two persons fearlessly in the busiest street.

The victims have been identified as Tanveer and Bilal. It can be seen in the video that the accused escaped easily after the incident.
Upon receiving information, senior police officials and a team from Forensic Science Agency arrived at the spot, collected the evidence and shifted the bodies to the hospital for post-mortem.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Race Course SHO Inspector Raja Iftikhar said the victims belonged to Abbottabad and Hazara and were residing in Rawalpindi. He said a case will be registered on the arrival of their relatives. However, initial findings suggest that it was a result of a personal enmity.

5,HBL PSL security irks traders,Owners protest forced closure of businesses around Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium,"The district administration has closed down businesses around the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium including the Shamsabad Food Streed ahead of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) Matches in the garrison city, prompting businessmen to protest the closure.
The Rawalpindi police have declared these businesses a security risk. PSL matches are starting from March 2 at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.
According to officials, sixty big eateries, 600 shops on Double Road and more than 100 offices of private companies have been closed as part of the security measures.
The move, deemed necessary for security reasons by the Rawalpindi police, has raised concerns among local businessmen who fear substantial losses.
The Union of Double Road Shops, Traders, and Food Street Union leaders have expressed their dissatisfaction through protests. The closure of Double Road, a major thoroughfare, has been implemented for traffic, with barriers restricting access to pedestrians attending the matches.
The closure also extends to Rawalpindi's Allama Iqbal Park entrance on Double Road, where entry is restricted for the duration of the matches.
Shopkeepers on Double Road emphasised the economic impact of this decision, particularly during the approaching Ramadan season when economic activities are traditionally heightened. Faisal Aziz, a shopkeeper, voiced concerns, stating that if adequate security cannot be ensured for the teams, matches should be relocated away from Rawalpindi.
Agha Naveed, another shopkeeper, highlighted the negative consequences on businesses, emphasising that the suspension of economic activities due to the matches and road closures would adversely affect their livelihoods. Mehmood Khan, a shopkeeper, suggested an alternative solution by proposing the relocation of all PSL matches to other cities instead of shutting down markets.
Farooq Nasir, a local food vendor, pointed out that the food market is consistently impacted whenever matches take place. The closure of the food market for an extended period will result in substantial financial losses for businesses operating there. Nasir urged an immediate end to the shutdown and the implementation of strict security standard operating procedures (SOPs).
The concerned shopkeepers and vendors underscored the need to balance security measures with the economic impact on local businesses.

8,Alumna brings water relief to Chakwal school,Resolves longstanding problem of lack of access to clean drinking water,"The former student of a renowned female school in Chakwal became a messiah for the staff and students of the educational institute, which lacked basic facilities including drinking water.
Built in 1935 to equip girls with the jewel of education, the Government Girls High School No 1 has so far produced millions of female students, who are now playing multiple roles in society. Around 2,200 female students are currently studying in this school.
Ironically, the largest-ever school in Chakwal district had been lacking basic facilities for the past several years. The absence of a library and clean drinking water became the hallmark of the leading institution. The female students and the academic staff either used to drink contaminated water or bring clean water from their homes. The students suffered from various diseases.
Finally a task, which was the responsibility of the elected representatives and the district government, was done by a former student. Gul Rana Azhar helped install a water filtration plant for Rs1.1 million and inaugurated the plant by cutting the ribbon.

Earlier, the school’s principal, Musarrat Jabeen, other teachers and students received Gul Rana Azhar and her husband Chaudhry Azhar Mehmood Chakral and showered flower petals on them. Gul Rana told the media that newly-appointed principal Musarrat Jabeen drew her attention to the non-availability of clean water in the school. “I assured the principal of providing the water filtration plant after consulting my husband.” She expressed her pleasure in solving the long-standing problem of drinking water for thousands of students at the school where she studied herself.
Azhar Mehmood said that the installation of the water filtration plant was possible because of his wife’s interest and that the project would keep benefitting the students in future.
Paying tribute to Gul Rana and her husband Azhar, School principal Musarrat Jabeen said that the long-standing problem of drinking water for 2,200 female students and about 60 staff members in the school has been finally resolved.
She said that the school had no facility for the provision of clean water for a long time and repeated reminders to the higher authorities and philanthropists turned out to be a futile exercise.
“The school girls are extremely happy about easy access to the drinking water and pay tribute to the couple for the facility,” she added.
