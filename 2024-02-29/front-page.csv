• ECP likely to rule on women, minority seats for PTI-SIC alliance before session begins
• Nawaz’s plea against Mansehra poll decision turned down; presiding officers notified for election of new head of state
ISLAMABAD: An as-yet ‘incomplete’ National Assembly — short of reserved seats claimed by the PTI-Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) alliance — will hold its inaugural sitting today (Thurs­day) after President Arif Alvi relented from his earlier stance and assented to a summary seeking the summoning of the maiden sitting of the lower house.
Earlier, the NA Secretariat had summoned a session following the refusal of the president. A formal notification to this effect was issued on Wednesday, which stated that the session would start at 10am. The notification said: “Whereas, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs…has been pleased to approve that arrangements for first sitting of the National Assembly may be made in terms of clause (2) of Article 91…”
 
 

But in a late-night development, President Arif Alvi also approved a summary calling for a session on Thursday morning.
 






A statement issued by the Presidency, took issue with the tone of the summary sent to President Alvi by the caretaker prime minister, adding that he was calling the session as he expected that the issue of reserved seats would be settled by the 21st day after the polls, as envisaged in the law.
 






 






Also on Wednesday night, the NA Secretariat cancelled all invitation cards issued to ‘VIPs’ over security concerns. Sources said that the passes had been cancelled against the backdrop of the pandemonium witnessed during the first sitting of the KP Assembly.
A source in the NA Secretariat told Dawn that SIC leaders and workers, seeking invitation cards for their supporters, had exchanged heated words with NA officials.
The contention that the lower house is ‘incomplete’ comes primarily from the PTI, which has been up in arms over the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) inaction regarding the allocation of over 23 reserved seats for women and minorities to its bloc.
Nearly all PTI members of assemblies, except Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Omar Ayub, have joined the SIC bloc in a bid to secure reserved seats.
Although this house has 266 general seats, elections were not held in NA-8 Bajaur due to the death of a candidate. In addition, around half a dozen seats have been vacated by candidates such as Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Marriyum Aurangzeb (on a reserved seat), Yousaf Raza Gilani, Shehbaz Sharif, Ali Amin Gandapur, and Maryam Nawaz, who emerged victorious on multiple seats.
Mr Gilani is also the potential PPP nominee for the Senate chairman, whereas Ms Aurangzeb has taken oath as a member of the Punjab Assembly.
Proceedings
When the house meets today, the incumbent speaker, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, will administer oath to the lawmakers-elect. The house will be adjourned after this exercise.
 
 

On the second day, the election for the speaker and his deputy will be held before noon, and the pair will be administered oath the same day. On the third day of the session, parliamentarians will select a leader of the house, or prime minister.
Shehbaz Sharif is the joint candidate for the PM slot against PTI-backed Omar Ayub while Ayaz Sadiq will contest the speaker election against PTI-backed Amir Dogar.
PPP lawmaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah will vie for the deputy speaker slot as a joint candidate of the PML-N and the PPP. The PPP and PML-N reached a power-sharing deal last week after the former agreed to support Shehbaz Sharif for the PM seat in return for governorships and Senate chairman slot.
It may be noted that following the Feb 8 polls, a multi-party alliance was formed comprising the PPP, PML-N, MQM-P, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party, and the Balochistan Awami Party. Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s political party has four seats in the National Assembly. Currently, he is up in arms against the election results. Will he sit on the treasury benches or the opposition, it is yet to be seen.
Reserved seats for SIC
At the moment, the PTI’s case for the reserved seats is before the ECP, which reserved its judgement on Wednesday after hearing stakeholders.
SIC counsel Barrister Ali Zafar argued that PTI-backed independent candidates joined the SIC, which was a political party registered with the ECP and has its symbol.
 
 

“Therefore PTI-backed independent candidates are now members of SIC and entitled to the reserved seats of women and minorities in accordance with their numbers in parliament,” he stressed. He also called out the PPP, PML-N, and the MQM-P which sought the reserved seats, saying their demand was tantamount to the mandate theft.
He said as per Article 51 any independent candidate could join any political party. “It does not say that the candidates are only required to join a political party which has an elected member in parliament,” he said, adding that the word used in Article 51 is “political party”, not “parliamentary party”.
The second argument raised is that SIC has not submitted a list for the reserved seats. Section 104 of the Election Act does require that a list has to be submitted, but that is only procedural, he added.
“However what is certain is that reserved seats cannot be denied on technical grounds and that these were not transferable,” Barrister Ali Zafar said.
On one occasion, the ECP member from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa asked Barrister Zafar if he wanted the commission to de-list the PTI after giving it a two-day notice. The SIC counsel replied that procedures would have to be followed for it.
Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, while pointing out that the SIC had not submitted the priority list of candidates, asked if the lists could be submitted after the election.
ECP member Babar Hasan Bharwana asked how could the reserved seats be allocated based on ‘independents’. The SIC has no status without the independent members, he said, asking why should not these seats be distributed among the parties which had won the seats in polls.
Barrister Ali Zafar said under the constitution the independents could join any enlisted party.
PPP’s Farooq H. Naek said that not one member of the SIC had won the general seat, adding that the council did not submit any priority list to the commission. He said as per Section 104 of the Elections Act, a new list could not be submitted after the date of the nomination papers has passed.
At this, Barrister Zafar said the BAP had been joined by independent lawmakers after 2018 elections. He said the BAP was not present in the KP Assembly before the independents joined it, but it was given reserved seats. PML-N’s Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar said that the Sunni Ittehad Council did not participate in the general elections.
Meanwhile, the ECP on Wednesday rejected the plea of former PM Nawaz Sharif challenging the election result of NA-15 in Mansehra. In another related development, the ECP notified five presiding officers for the conduct of upcoming presidential elections.

1,Nawaz wary of challenges facing incoming govt,PML-N's tally in NA rises to 104 seats; Ayaz Sadiq nominated for speaker; PPP’s Mustafa Shah joint candidate for deputy speaker role.,"• PML-N supremo endorses Shehbaz for PM slot, party’s tally in NA rises to 104 seats
• Ayaz Sadiq nominated for speaker; PPP’s Mustafa Shah joint candidate for deputy speaker role
ISLAMABAD: As the PML-N is all set to take the reins of the country, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday forewarned about looming challenges, saying the next two years in power would be quite challenging for the coalition because of economic and political instability.
These remarks were made by the PML-N supreme leader at the parliamentary party meeting which he co-chaired along with his brother party president Shehbaz Sharif. During the meeting, the elder Sharif also endorsed the deal between the PML-N and the PPP to form the government and hoped Shehbaz Sharif would rid the country of all ‘gigantic’ problems.
“Shehbaz is the party’s nominee for the office of prime minister while Sardar Ayaz Sadiq is our candidate for the post of the National Assembly speaker,” said Nawaz Sharif, who was the initial PML-N candidate for the PM slot.
 






Addressing the PML-N parliamentary party meeting, Nawaz Sharif said the next two years would be crucial for the new government in the Centre due to a fragile economy and political situation in the country. He said the new government will have to face the opposition vehemently initially. He added the first job should be to tame inflation and improve governance.
After two years, the next government will have ample opportunity to do a lot for people and the country. “The way Shehbaz Sharif had run the government for 16 months was quite challenging; even I could not manage,” he added. He lashed PTI founder Imran Khan for what he called “promoting” the politics of hatred and misguiding the youth of the country.
The decisions announced by Nawaz Sharif endorsed an agreement between the PML-N and PPP regarding a power-sharing formula as per which the office of the PM and the NA speaker will be given to the PML-N while other coveted positions, like slots of the Senate chairman and president, will go to the PPP.
Shehbaz touts PML-N achievements
On the occasion, Shehbaz Sharif recalled the achievements of PML-N and Nawaz Sharif in the previous tenures and said Nawaz Sharif had rid the country of electricity crisis and given a network of motorways across the country.
 






He said that with the support of the coalition parties, he would try his best to overcome the problems faced by the country. He also sought pledges from the PML-N MNA-elect to put an end to the woes of the country. He pointed out that after the joining of three independent candidates, the total number of PML-N seats in the National Assembly has increased to 104.
After a meeting of allied parties, a delegation visited the Islamabad residence of JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman to convince him to join the government. The Maulana informed his erstwhile allies that his party members would take oath in the maiden session. However, the meeting remained inconclusive, with PML-N leader Ayaz Sadiq hoping that the JUI-F would rejoin the alliance.
‘Everyone to be on the same page’
Soon after the dinner reception, PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal told reporters that the new government would take all coalition parties on board in all major decisions and would also invite the opposition as well.
 
 

“We will go to the opposition parties and JUI-F so that all political forces can make efforts to put the country on the path of progress and development,” he added.
Khawaja Asif said the PML-N had also tried to work with the PTI government when his party was sitting on the opposition benches but all its offers were rejected. He said legislation was passed about the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and IMF deal due to “pressure” from the military establishment and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).
MQM leaders Mustafa Kamal, Khalid Magsi of BAP, Chaudhry Salik of PML-Q, and Aleem Khan of IPP reposed full support for Shehbaz Sharif and other joint nominees for the coveted slots.
He emphasised the need for political reconciliation to address the people’s problems. Mr Magsi said all allied parties have agreed on the name of Ghulam Mustafa Shah as their joint candidate for the office of NA deputy speaker.

2,Fuel prices likely to rise by up to Rs4 per litre,Price of petrol is estimated to be higher by Rs3-4 per litre than that of HSD by Rs1-1.5 per litre.,"ISLAMABAD: The prices of petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) are estimated to increase by Rs1-4 per litre on Thursday (February 29) for the next fortnight due to minor adjustments in international prices, import premiums, and the exchange rate.
Informed sources said that the prices of both major petroleum products — petrol and HSD — moved slightly in both directions (10 to 50 cents per barrel) in the international market over the past fortnight, and the Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had to pay higher import premiums on petrol.
 
 

As a result, the price of petrol is estimated to be higher by Rs3-4 per litre than that of HSD by Rs1-1.5 per litre, depending on the final exchange rate calculation. The US dollar lost about 15 paise against the rupee on February 28. The prices of kerosene and light diesel oil are expected to remain stable.
For the purpose of price calculations, officials said the price of petrol had risen by about $0.5 per barrel to $90.78 from $89.20 per barrel over the last two weeks, while the HSD price inched down by about eight cents per barrel — to $101.05 from about $101.13. The rupee, on the other hand, generally remained stable. The premium paid by the PSO for securing product cargoes went up slightly for petrol to $10.45 per barrel this fortnight from $9.47 per barrel. It remained unchanged for HSD at $6.5 per barrel.
The government has already reached the Rs60 per litre petroleum levy — the maximum permissible limit under the law — on both petrol and HSD. The government had set a budget target to collect Rs869 billion as a petroleum levy on petroleum products during the current fiscal year under the commitments made with the International Monetary Fund.
 
 

It has already collected about Rs475bn in the first half (July-December) of the fiscal year, although the per-litre levy was gradually increased. The government is expected to mop up about Rs970bn by the end of the year, although the revised target has now been set at Rs920bn by end-June.
Petroleum and electricity prices have been the key drivers of the high inflation rate recorded at 27.5pc in January, as measured by the consumer price index.
Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct impacting the budgets of the middle- and lower-middle class.
On the other hand, HSD price is considered highly inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube wells and threshers. It particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
At present, the government is charging about Rs82 per litre tax on both petrol and HSD. Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, the government is charging Rs60 per litre PDL on both products.
On the other hand, it is charging Rs50 per litre on high octane blending component and 95RON petrol. The government is also charging about Rs17-20 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD. Petrol and HSD are major revenue spinners, with their sales of about 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes per month compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene.

3,Kakar urges IHC to refrain from exercising executive powers,"Says there is an armed insurgency in Balochistan, highlights security challenges","ISLAMABAD: Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Wednesday asked the Islamabad High Court (IHC) not to exercise the powers vested in the executive and let them to take decision in the matter related to its domain.
However, he said that the upcoming parliament can legislate for oversight on spy agencies.
PM Kakar appeared before IHC Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani in the Baloch missing persons case. Earlier, he had skipped the hearing twice but finally appeared in response to the notice issued to him.
Police closed nearby roads to traffic about half an hour before his arrival, and entry into the IHC was also restricted before the PM’s arrival.

Says there is an armed insurgency in Balochistan, highlights security challenges

Clad in a dark suit, Mr Kakar entered the courtroom of Justice Kayani while the judge was hearing the case related to the arrest of Dr Shireen Mazari in November 2022. The caretaker PM took the front row and sat along with a court reporter.
As the hearing in Dr Mazari’s case concluded, Justice Kayani resumed the hearing in the Baloch missing persons case.
A deputy attorney general signalled for him to approach the rostrum. Justice Kayani informed him that the case had been pending for about two years, and still, five persons could not be found.
Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan apprised the judge that out of 59 missing persons, the details of 54 had been shared with the petitioners and their counsel, Imaan Mazari.
PM Kakar told the court that armed clashes are going on in Balochistan between security forces and those who have waged war against the state.
He mentioned that civil society criticises the government if someone is picked up on suspicion of insurgency; however, they never condemn the insurgents.
Justice Kayani remarked that the court has no issue even if law enforcement agencies take someone into custody; however, it must be documented somewhere.
PM Kakar replied that the criminal justice system is on the verge of collapse, and suspects take advantage of legal loopholes to go scot-free. He pointed out that about 90,000 innocent citizens have lost their lives in terrorist incidents.
The constitution provides the right to life, and the insurgents are involved in terrorism and racial profiling of the citizens. They don’t abide by the law; therefore, they cannot be treated on par with law-abiding citizens, he added.
Justice Kayani remarked that the parliament can legislate to strengthen the criminal justice system.
Kakar said that the insurgents eliminated moderate and liberal-minded people who were against militancy, adding that the former chief justice of Balochistan High Court, Muhammad Noor Muskanzai, was assassinated by the insurgents as he compiled a report against their wishes.
Justice Kayani informed him that the court has constituted a committee comprising directors general of the Inter-Services Intelligence, Military Intelligence, and the Intelligence Bureau and will seek a report from them directly. He observed that there is no institution above the law.
PM Kakar urged the judge not to make decisions on matters that pertain to the executive domain. However, he stated that he would request the upcoming government and parliament to legislate for oversight of the spy agencies. Justice Kayani, on the other hand, remarked that the court would proceed strictly in accordance with the law and adjourned further hearing.

4,PTI reminds IMF of ‘fair polls’ promise,Gohar says Imran does not want to hurt economy; civil society organisations urged to hold election audit.,"ISLAMABAD: In a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the PTI has urged the lender to endorse an audit of the 2024 elections for the sake of political stability in the country, before entering into a dialogue with Islamabad for a new bailout package.
This was disclosed during a press conference addressed by PTI leaders Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Omar Ayub, Meher Bano Qureshi, and Muzammil Aslam in Islamabad on Wednesday.
 
 

Barrister Gohar said that a letter — written by Imran Khan’s spokesperson Raoof Hasan — was handed over to the IMF resident representative in Pakistan and would be opened in Washington. He said once the letter was received by the intended recipients, it would be then shared with the media in Pakistan as well.
 






“For now, we can share that PTI’s founding chairman Imran Khan does not want any adverse effects on the economy of Pakistan. In the letter, we have reminded IMF of its promises that the election will be free and fair,” he said.

Gohar says Imran does not want to hurt economy; civil society organisations urged to hold election audit

On the other hand, caretaker premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar in a TV show expressed his disapproval over the PTI leadership’s move and termed it ‘highly irresponsible’.
The letter was sent at time when the caretaker government had worked significantly for economic revival, he said. There were appropriate forums for the electoral disputes and the PTI’s gesture of writing a letter to the IMF was unjustified and highly irresponsible, he added.
The draft text of the letter was also circulating on social media on Wednesday. Dawn reached out to Mr Hasan to confirm its authenticity, who said that this was indeed the draft he had signed.
 
 

The letter also calls for an election audit from civil society organisations Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) and Pattan-Coalition38, to expose rigging.
Barrister Gohar said those parties that lacked the mandate to form the government would not be able to steer the country.
“Today a debate has been started about why the PTI wrote a letter to the IMF. It is the vision of Imran Khan to ensure the development of the country and not let anyone become a burden on the economy,” he said.
‘Broken promises’
Economist Muzammil Aslam said it was being portrayed that PTI had done something wrong by writing to the IMF.
“I want to make it clear that Pakistan has entered into 24 programmes with IMF since 1958. From 1988 to 2024, Pakistan got 14 IMF programmes. Out of these, only one programme was completed. The biggest bailout package of $10 billion in Pakistan’s history was taken by the PPP in 2008, but it could not be completed,” he said.
 
 

He said the PTI entered a deal with the IMF for $6bn package but the PTI only took $3 billion from the Fund, adding that the PML-N tried to revive the programme after the ouster of the PTI government. He further claimed that the PML-N went back on its commitments with the Fund thrice.
“Then, Ishaq Dar could not complete the review and levelled allegations against the IMF that it wanted to compromise Pakistan’s missile programme, which the IMF rebutted. Then Mr Dar alleged that the IMF was not allowing the release of funds for elections, but the IMF again refuted it,” he claimed.
Sharing details of a meeting between Imran Khan and the Fund officials at Zaman Park before the PDM government signed a $3bn deal with the lender, he said the PTI founder had asked the IMF for assurances of free and fair polls.
The nine-month programme was supposed to span three governments: the PDM, the caretaker government, and the elected government. “The IMF had said the last instalment will be released to the new government,” he said, adding that in the first week of November the IMF again contacted the PTI.
“That is why we decided to write a letter to the IMF,” he said. He said the ongoing programme would end on March 30 and the new government could address the grievances of all parties before going for a new agreement.

5,Ruckus mars maiden KP session as MPAs sworn in,"• 116 legislators take oath amid sloganeering, shouting matches • Balochistan Assembly elects 57 lawmakers amid tight security...","

• 116 legislators take oath amid sloganeering, shouting matches
• Balochistan Assembly elects 57 lawmakers amid tight security
• Election for speaker, deputy speaker in both houses scheduled for today
PESHAWAR / QUETTA: Newly elected members of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan assemblies were sworn in on Wednesday, with Punjab and Sindh MPAs already having taken the oath last week.
In KP, 116 newly elected representatives took the oath in a session marred by ruckus. The meeting of the provincial legislature was summoned by KP Governor Ghulam Ali last week following advice from the caretaker Chief Minister Syed Arshad Hussain Shah.
The first session of the 12th KP Assembly began almost two hours late due to protests and riots by PTI workers present in the gallery and party-backed lawmakers — now members of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — who chanted slogans of “Qaidi number 804” (prisoner number 804) and “Long Live Imran Khan”.
Apart from PTI supporters, party lawmakers were also seen holding portraits of the former prime minister.
Workers of political parties, mostly from the PTI, also took over the government officers’ and media galleries, leaving many journalists outside the assembly building.
Not only the galleries and premises of the KP Assembly but a huge number of workers, mostly party workers and relatives of the elected members, were seen on Khyber Road waiting for their turn to enter the Assembly building.
Inside the assembly hall, Speaker Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani also seemed helpless, as several of his announcements calling for an order in the house went unnoticed.
However, amid all the shouting matches and sloganeering, Mr Ghani managed to administer the oath to 116 MPAs-elect.
Mr Ghani later adjourned the session till 10am today (Thursday), when voting for the speaker and deputy speaker slots is scheduled. He told the house that the nomination papers for both positions could be submitted by 5pm on Wednesday and could be withdrawn by 11pm the same day.
Meanwhile, a lota was thrown at a PML-N lawmaker, Sobia Shahid, who waved a wristwatch in the hall, referring to Imran Khan’s conviction in the Toshakhana case.
Opposition lawmakers later held a news conference on the assembly premises and announced that PPP’s Ehsanullah Miankhel would be the opposition’s joint candidate for the speaker, whereas Arbab Wasim of the PTI-Parliamentarian would contest for the deputy speaker’s slot.
On the other hand, PTI’s Omar Ayub Khan said Imran Khan had nominated Babar Salim Swati as their candidate for the KP Assembly speaker.
Balochistan PA
In Balochistan, 57 newly elected members in the 65-member provincial assembly took the oath in the first session, presided over by senior MPA Zamrak Khan Piralizai in the absence of Speaker Mir Jan Muhammad Khan Jamali.

The session of the Balochistan Assembly, summoned by Governor Malik Abdul Wali Khan Kakar, began an hour behind the scheduled time of 3pm. Ahead of the meeting, special security arrangements were made in and around the assembly building.
The security was beefed up in response to calls of a protest outside the assembly building by an alliance of four nationalist parties against alleged vote rigging during the Feb 8 polls. However, only two of them — the Hazara Democratic Party (HDP) and Pashtoonkhwa National Awami Party — staged protests on Wednesday and tried to reach the assembly building.
However, their advance was restricted by the blockade of all roads leading to the assembly building and the hundreds of security officials deployed on the way. The roadblocks around the assembly venue led to widespread traffic disruptions across Quetta.
Wednesday’s assembly session saw Mr Piralizai administering the oath to the 57 MPAs-elect.
Absent from the session were eight members: Jam Kamal Khan Alyani, Sardar Muhammad Saleh Bhootani and Muhammad Khan Lehri of PML-N; Mir Zafar Zehri and Muhammad Khalil Dummar of JUI-F; Sarfraz Bugti of PPP; Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani; and Sardar Akhtar Mengal of BNP-M, who left his provincial assembly seat for the National Assembly.
The PML-N was yet to finalise the name of its candidate for the speaker slot on Wednesday night. Sources said the party’s central leadership would announce its nominee on Thursday morning.
However, the PPP has nominated Ghazala Gola for the deputy speakership, who has also taken a nomination form from Assembly Secretary Tahir Shah Kakar and will file her nomination papers on Thursday morning.
Mr Kakar said the schedule for the chief minister’s election would be announced by the elected speaker but was expected on March 4.
The PPP leadership has yet to finalise its candidate for the CM slot. A party leader told Dawn PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari was expected to visit Quetta in the next couple of days to announce the party’s candidate for the chief minister’s slot.
