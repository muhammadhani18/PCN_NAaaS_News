0,JUI-F to boycott elections for chief minister and PA speaker,Durrani says other parties requested to join protests against poll ‘rigging’.,"PESHAWAR: The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl on Wednesday announced that it would boycott the elections for the offices of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s chief minister and the provincial assembly’s speaker and deputy speaker.
The house will elect its speaker and deputy speaker today (Thursday).
“We [JUI-F] have decided not to take part in the elections for the chief minister, speaker, and deputy speaker.
We are going to boycott this electoral exercise,” senior JUI-F leader and former chief minister Akram Khan Durrani told reporters after the oath-taking ceremony for MPAs.

Durrani says other parties requested to join protests against poll ‘rigging’

Mr Durrani said that the JUI-F informed the other opposition parties in the provincial assembly in a meeting on Wednesday about its intention to boycott elections.
He said that his party had the majority of seats in the Balochistan Assembly and could even install its own chief minister in the province, but it preferred to sit on the opposition benches.
The JUI-F leader said that his party turned down a PML-N proposal to join the federal government and would continue to raise voice against election “rigging” on the floor of the house as well as in street protests.
He said that political parties were holding demonstrations against poll “rigging” across the country, and even it was protested by the PTI, which won polls in KP.
“Religious forces are on the streets across the country [against polling rigging], while nationalist parties are staging protests in Sindh and Balochistan. The Awami National Party is also protesting in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where our party is set to announce its protest schedule,” he said.
Mr Durrani said that his party was in contact with others with requests to join protests.
He complained about violence on election day and alleged that voters were taken away at gunpoint and ballot boxes were stuffed with bogus votes.
The JUI-F leader claimed that he had videos showing his rivals stamp ballot papers.
He took a dig at PTI workers sitting in the visitors’ gallery during the oath-taking ceremony in the assembly over their rowdy behaviour and said that the house appeared to be a “cattle market.”
Mr Durrani said that in such circumstances, any respectable person would think twice before becoming part of the house.
“Culture and traditions take hundreds of years to take shape before they drive the world. When a nation moves away from its culture and religion, then it can’t survive for long,” he said.
The JUI-F leader said under the new government, the inflation rate would hit an all-time high.
In the provincial assembly, the PML-N and JUI-F have nine seats, including seven general seats and two reserved for women.
On Tuesday, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman announced that his party would neither become part of the government nor take part in the opposition leader’s election.

PESHAWAR: Awami National Party (ANP) provincial president Aimal Wali Khan on Wednesday demanded of Supreme Court Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to probe the ‘unprecedented rigging’ in the Feb 8 general elections.
“If the Supreme Court’s inquiry begins, I will produce more than 50 people, who were approached by the ‘powerful’ people to offer election victory for money. I will share their WhatsApp messages with the chief justice of Pakistan,” Mr Aimal told a rally against election “rigging” outside the provincial assembly building.
ANP central general secretary Mian Iftikhar Hussain and provincial general secretary Sardar Hussain Babak also addressed protesters.
The ANP provincial president said that all nationalist parties, which were protesting poll rigging in different parts of the country, should unite to take their movement forward effectively.

Aimal urges nationalists to protest together

He said that his party’s struggle for the supremacy of the Constitution would continue.
Mr Aimal said the struggle was also meant for the freedom of those judges who didn’t decide cases on their own.
He wondered why the Supreme Court didn’t take notice of the countrywide political protests against poll “rigging.”
The ANP leader came down hard on authorities for creating problems for the party workers wanting to attend protest rallies.
He warned that if the practice continued, the ANP would demonstrate outside the Peshawar corps commander’s house.
In a veiled reference to the PTI, Mr Aimal insisted that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been handed over to the attackers of military installations on May 9 after the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan.
He said that the ANP would not backtrack from its demand for the supremacy of the Constitution and the dispensation of justice.
The ANP leader and protesters vowed that they, along with their family members and the next generation, would continue the struggle for the constitutional rights of the people.
He urged the military to perform its basic duty of protecting the country’s borders.
ANP central general secretary Mian Iftikhar Hussain told protesters that the security establishment was “punishing the ANP for being nonviolent and for raising voice for the rights of the people.’
He claimed that election rigging took away 25 assembly seats from the ANP.
“If the votes polled on Feb 8 are fairly counted, we [ANP] will have the majority of seats in this house,” he said.
Mr Hussain said through rigging in the Feb 8 general elections, all those, who used to raise voices inside parliament for the betterment of Pakistan, were sidelined.
He warned parliamentarians against “even thinking about amending” the Constitution.

10,PHC stops shifting of psychiatric hospital to another health facility,Bench seeks response of govt to plea against the move,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court on Wednesday stopped provincial health department from discontinuing services at more than a century-old Sarhad Hospital for Psychiatric Diseases (SHPD) and shifting its assets and staff to a new psychiatric health facility in Peshawar.
A bench consisting of Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Sahibzada Asadullah issued notices to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief secretary and health secretary, asking them to respond to a petition filed by Friends of Mental Health Organisation.
The organisation has challenged the government’s decision to shift SHPD to Institute of Mental health Behavioural Sciences, Hayatabad, called as Fountain House, along with staff and assets.
The bench directed the government to maintain status quo on the matter till further order. Next date for hearing of the petition will be fixed later.

Bench seeks response of govt to plea against the move

The petitioner is an organisation focusing on and financing mental health projects at SHPD. The petitioner was represented by advocates Nouman Muhib Kakakhel and Saifullah Muhib Kakakhel.
They stated that SHPD was established inside Peshawar Central Prison in 1854 during British rule in India. They said that the hospital provided free of cost services to patients suffering from mental ailment throughout the province. They added that setting up the hospital inside the prison was due to security concerns with regard to patients with extreme psychological disorders.
Nouman Kakakhel said that in the light of rising mental health issues in the province, it was deemed necessary to have another hospital to compliment and assist the present setup of SHPD, therefore, a PC-I was prepared to make another health facility Fountain House in Hayatabad, Peshawar.
He argued that the PC-I was originally prepared with regard to establishing a new mental health hospital apart from SHPD as there was only one such hospital for the entire province which also accommodated Afghan refugees and patients from Gilgit-Baltistan.
Mr Kakakhel said that surprisingly, instead of setting up a separate full-fledged hospital, SHPD was being done away with and it was decided that all its assets and staff would be transferred to Fountain House.
He pointed out that a work plan was issued by the health department on January 24, 2024, wherein a timeline was provided with regard to shifting of SHPD to Fountain House. Following that, he said, the impugned office order was issued on February 26, 2024, to have shifting of all the facilities and ending the same on March 1, 2024.
He contended that both the hospitals collectively could accommodate 300 or so patients. He added that it was a meagre number for the whole province along with additional influx of patients from other areas.
He said that ending provision of mental health facilities at SHPD, merely because a new hospital had been established, would have a negative impact on all the people dependent on it.
He requested the court to declare as illegal and against public interest the decision to discontinue services of SHPD from March 1, 2024 and transfer its staff and assets to the Fountain House.
He prayed the court to declare that Fountain House should be made a separate hospital with full-fledged facilities to complement and support SHPD in providing mental health services to people.
The counsel said that relatives of patients admitted to SHPD had time and again written applications to relevant quarters with regard to non-shifting of the hospital to any other place, but in vain.

It is worth mentioning here that elections on PK-91 had been postponed after the death of a contender a couple of days ahead of the February 8 polls.

PROTEST: The traders of the wholesale grocery market on Wednesday protested the prolonged electricity loadshedding and inflated power bills.
Speaking to the protesters, All Tajir Ittehad chairman Ameer Khan Afridi and general secretary Israr Shinwari lamented that the residents were facing inhuman loadshedding of 12 to 15 hours. They alleged that Peshawar Electric Supply Company sent them inflated power bills despite excessive blackouts.
They said a heavy load had been put on the Rawalpindi Road 132KV grid station as a promised new grid station for the city could not be constructed.
They pointed out that areas like Kotal Township, Lachi and Gumbat tehsils had their separate grid stations.
They said power supply was suspended daily at 8am till 9pm, badly disturbing business activities.
They recalled that the Rawalpindi Road grid station had caught fire a few years ago, burning down 11 feeders. They said equipment at the grid had become obsolete.
They said land for the new grid was acquired decades ago, but work on it could not be started till date.
