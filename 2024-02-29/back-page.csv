0,US seeks Israel’s assurance for using American weapons,Mid-March deadline set to sign commitment to adhere to international law.,"

WASHINGTON: The Biden administration has established a mid-March deadline for Israel to sign a letter committing to adhere to international law when using American weapons.
Furnished by Washi­ngton, the letter also mandates Israel to facilitate humanitarian aid into Gaza, where over half a million Palestinians are on the brink of famine.
Axios, a US news outlet, which has a copy of the letter, reports that on Tuesday, US officials in both Washington and Tel Aviv formally briefed their Israeli counterparts on this new policy. They provided them with a draft letter, essential for Israel to sign.
According to a senior Israeli official, the US has requested written assurances by mid-March. This timeline aligns with Secretary of State Blinken’s goal to certify them by month-end. Israel has the flexibility to designate the government representative signing the letter.

Mid-March deadline set to sign commitment to adhere to international law

Similar letters have also been presented to several other nations utilising US weaponry, as disclosed by a US official to Axios.
This assurance is mandated under a memorandum President Biden issued earlier this month and indicates a shift in US policy towards Israel. The change follows concerns voiced by some Democratic senators regarding the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. Failure to provide the assurance by the deadline will result in a pause in US weapon transfers to the country.
The Biden administration’s latest push for Israel to adhere to international laws of war and peace is perceived by many as insufficient and belated. According to a survey of American voters released on Tuesday, 57 per cent disapprove of President Biden’s Middle East policy, while 36 per cent approve, with some respondents expressing no opinion.
The Data for Progress survey also highlights that 67 per cent of voters want the US to endorse calls for a permanent ceasefire and a de-escalation in Gaza.
Earlier this week, Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old active-duty member of the US Air Force, set himself on fire in protest against the Biden administration’s Gaza policy. He died on Sunday at a Washington hospital.
 
 

Bushnell live-streamed himself walking towards the Israeli embassy in Washington, and upon reaching the destination, dousing himself in gasoline before lighting a match on his clothing and repeatedly shouting “Free Palestine”.
On Tuesday, the UN Security Council heard from various UN aid agencies that well over half a million Gazans were just a step away from famine. They blamed the world body’s failure to enforce a ceasefire in Gaza for the current situation.
Russia, China, and some other nations blamed the US for vetoing all ceasefire moves in the council.
“All council attempts towards this end have been blocked by the United States, who has used its veto four times for this purpose,” said Russian Ambas­s­ador Vassily Nebenzia while addressing the council.
“By doing so, Washington bears full responsibility for the significant number of civilian victims in Gaza,” said the ambassador, stating that the cost of such vetoes is 30,000 lives.
The US representative, Robert Wood, however, said that Russia was in no position to criticise any country while Moscow continues to bomb Ukraine.
Opposing the Israeli plan to invade Rafah, Wood said a major ground offensive should not proceed in Rafah “under the current circumstances”.
The Pakistani representative noted that Israel was now preparing for a ground offensive on Rafah, which will further intensify the suffering of the Palestinians.
Against this backdrop, Pakistan stressed the need to secure a complete and durable ceasefire without any conditions; implement and enforce the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice; and halt the demonisation of UNRWA.

1,Wapda to digitise prehistoric rock carvings at Diamer Basha Dam site,"Contract encompasses extensive site documentation using terrestrial scanners, alongside archiving and modelling of scanned data."," 

ONE of the ancient rock carvings along the Indus River bank near the Diamer Basha Dam construction site. After completion of the dam, these carvings will be submerged. In this photo, ibex sketches, believed to date from pre-Islamic times, can be seen.

GILGIT: The Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) has signed a Rs46.5 million cultural preservation agreement for the digitisation and 3D modelling of significant rock carvings within the impact zone of the upcoming Diamer Basha Dam.
The eight-month contract, inked in Lahore, encompasses extensive site documentation using terrestrial scanners, alongside the consolidation, archiving, and modelling of scanned data for diverse applications, including 3D printing.
Wapda has signed the agreement with firm Quality Solutions Technologies (Pvt) Ltd, which will provide consultancy services for the project.
 
 

“In a ceremony held the other day, General Manager Diamer Basha Dam Project (Wapda) Nazakat Hussain and Director Business Development Quality Solutions Technologies Saad Ahmed Khan signed the agreement on behalf of their organisations,” said a statement issued on Wednesday.
“Member (Water) Wapda Jawaid Akhtar Latif, CEO Diamer Basha Dam Company Amir Bashir Chaudhry, Adviser Wapda Cultural Heritage Management Feryal Ali Gauhar, and Chief Engineer (Contracts) Diamer Basha Dam Project Abdur Rashid were also present on the occasion.
Diamer Basha Dam is being constructed in northern Pakistan, which serves as a repository of rich cultural heritage comprising an immense number of rock carvings. Wapda is implementing its Cultural Heritage Management Plan in the Diamer Basha Dam Project area to fulfil its national and international obligations.
The plan aims to preserve prehistoric rock carvings and inscriptions to be submerged in the water reservoir of Diamer Basha Dam, set up a museum and promote cultural tourism in Gilgit-Baltistan, particularly in Chilas and its suburban areas.
Experts say the construction of the Diamer Basha Dam threatens tens of thousands of rock engravings in the Diamer area of Gilgit-Baltistan. Some of the carvings date back to 8,000 BCE.
The Diamer district has one of the largest known numbers of rock engravings. Many are located on the banks of the Indus River.
According to Feryal Ali Gauhar, the lead consultant for cultural heritage management at Diamer Basha Dam, over 50,000 rock carvings and 5,000 inscriptions serve as a timeline from the Epipaleolithic period to the era of Buddhism. The earliest petroglyphs depict ibex and sheep.

2,Harry loses case against British govt over security,He had launched legal action after being told in Feb 2020 that he would no longer be given the “same degree” of protection when in Britain.,"LONDON: Prince Harry lost a court challenge against the UK government on Wednesday over a decision to change the level of his personal security when he visits the country.
The youngest son of King Charles III launched legal action against the government after being told in February 2020 that he would no longer be given the “same degree” of publicly funded protection when in Britain.
 
 

“The ‘bespoke’ process devised for the claimant in the decision of Feb 28, 2020 was, and is, legally sound,” Judge Peter Lane said in a 52-page judgment.
Harry sensationally left Britain in 2020 with his wife Meghan, eventually settling in California. He told a hearing at London’s court in December that security concerns were preventing visits back to the United Kingdom.
“The UK is my home. The UK is central to the heritage of my children,” he told court in a written statement read out by his lawyers. “That cannot happen if it’s not possible to keep them safe. “I cannot put my wife in danger like that and, given my experiences in life, I am reluctant to unnecessarily put myself in harm’s way too,” he added.

3,Solid waste generation to reach 3.8bn tonnes by 2050: UN,"Without urgent action on waste management, the global annual cost may reach $640.3bn, UNEP says.","ISLAMABAD: Municipal solid waste generation is predicted to grow from 2.3 billion tonnes in 2023 to 3.8 billion tonnes by 2050, reveals the Global Waste Management Outlook 2024 published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on Wednesday.
The global direct cost of waste management in 2020 was an estimated $252 billion, but when factoring in the hidden costs of pollution, poor health and climate change from poor waste disposal practices, the cost rises to $361bn.
Titled, “Beyond an age of waste: Turning rubbish into a resource,” the UNEP report provides the most substantial update on global waste generation and the cost of waste and its management since 2018. The analysis uses life cycle assessments to explore what the world could gain or lose through continuing business-as-usual, adopting halfway measures, or committing fully to zero waste and circular economy societies.
 






More waste is produced every year as a result of economic growth and unsustainable consumption and production patterns. Without urgent action on waste management by 2050 this global annual cost could almost double to a staggering $640.3bn, including $443bn in externalities.

Without urgent action on waste management, the global annual cost may reach $640.3bn, UNEP says

Only the circular economy approach would generate a projected annual full net gain of $108bn through waste avoidance, sustainable business practices, and full waste management.
Moving towards a circular economy and taking a zero waste approach is the only route to a safe, affordable and sustainable future. Since national contexts vary significantly, there is no one-size-fits-all approach or formula for systemic change, according to the report.
The report’s modelling shows that getting waste under control by taking waste prevention and management measures could limit net annual costs by 2050 to $270.2bn. However, projections show that a circular economy model, where waste generation and economic growth are decoupled by adopting waste avoidance, sustainable business practices, and full waste management, could in fact lead to a full net gain of $108.5bn per year.
Jointly published with the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA), the report provides an update on global waste generation and the cost of waste and its management since 2018.
 






The report, second since 2015, says that in 2020, 38 per cent of all municipal solid waste (810 million tonnes) was uncontrolled: that is, it was dumped in the environment or openly burned.
If waste management practices remain the same as today, by 2050 this figure will almost double to 1.6bn tonnes of MSW dumped or burned every year, contributing to climate change, marine plastic pollution, and adverse health effects. Since pollution from waste knows no borders, this is of international concern.
“Waste generation is intrinsically tied to GDP, and many fast-growing economies are struggling under the burden of rapid waste growth. By identifying actionable steps to a more resourceful future and emphasising the pivotal role of decision-makers in the public and private sectors to move towards zero waste, this report can support governments seeking to prevent missed opportunities to create more sustainable societies and to secure a livable planet for future generations,” said Inger Andersen, UNEP’s Executive Director.
“The findings of this report demonstrate that the world urgently needs to shift to a zero waste approach, while improving waste management to prevent significant pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and negative impacts to human health. Pollution from waste knows no borders, so it is in everyone’s interests to commit to waste prevention and invest in waste management where it is lacking.
“The solutions are available and ready to be scaled up. What is needed now is strong leadership to set the direction and pace required, and to ensure no one is left behind,” said Zoë Lenkiewicz, lead author of the report.

4,"Bitcoin hits $60,000 for first time in over two years",Flurry of capital into new US spot bitcoin exchange-traded products fuels a 42 per cent price rally in February.,"LONDON: Bitcoin hit $60,000 on Wednesday for the first time in more than two years, as a flurry of capital into new US spot bitcoin exchange traded products fuelled a 42 per cent price rally in February, which would mark its largest monthly gain since December 2020.
Bitcoin was last up 6 per cent at $60,131, its highest since November 2021, when it hit a record just below $70,000. Bitcoin was also heading for its largest week-on-week gain in a year, up 18.5pc since Feb 21.
Traders have poured into bitcoin ahead of April’s halving event — a process designed to slow the release of the cryptocurrency. In addition, the prospect of the Federal Reserve delivering a series of rate cuts this year has fed investor appetite for higher-yielding or more volatile assets.
 
 

The bigger bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a definite pickup in interest this week.
“Bitcoin is being driven by the support of consistent inflows into the new spot ETFs and outlook for April’s halving event and June’s Fed interest rate cuts,” Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at retail investment platform eToro, said.
The value of all the bitcoin in circulation has topped $2 trillion this month for the first time in two years, according to crypto platform CoinGecko, while the price of the token itself has doubled in just four months.
The three most popular, run by Grayscale, Fidelity and BlackRock, have seen trading volumes surge.
On Monday and Tuesday, around 110 million shares in the biggest three changed hands, about 51pc of the 215 million shares traded in the market’s most valuable companies — Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia, according to LSEG data.
Three weeks ago, this percentage was closer to 15pc.
Meanwhile, the world’s second biggest cryptocurrency Ether, which underpins the Ethereum blockchain network, rose 3.2pc to $3,353, having hit another two-year high earlier in the day. The price has risen 47pc in February, the biggest monthly gain since a 70pc rally in July 2022.

5,Palestinians urged to reach Al Aqsa mosque in Ramazan,"Ismail Haniyeh's call follows Biden saying there was agreement in principle for ceasefire between Israel, Hamas during Ramazan.","CAIRO: Hamas urged Palestinians on Wednesday to march to Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque at the start of Ramazan, raising the stakes in negotiations for a truce in Gaza.
The call by Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh followed comments by Biden, broadcast on Tuesday, that there was an agreement in principle for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas during Ramazan, while prisoners held by the Palestinians are released.
 
 

Biden said he hoped such an agreement, which a source said would also allow more aid into the stricken Palestinian enclave and bring the release of Palestinians prisoners, could be finalised by March 4, a few days before the start of fasting month.
Israel said it would allow Ramazan prayers at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa mosque but set limits according to what it called security needs, setting the stage for possible clashes if crowds of Palestinians turn up and Gaza war is still raging.
“This is a call on our people in Jerusalem and the West Bank to march to Al Aqsa since the first day of Ramazan,” Haniyeh said in a televised speech. He said Hamas was showing flexibility in talks with Israel but at the same time it was ready to continue fighting.
“It is the duty of the Arab and Islamic nations to take the initiative to break the starvation conspiracy in Gaza,” he said, referring to what Palestinians say appears to be a deliberate policy by Israel to deny them food.
Moscow talks
On Thursday, representatives of Hamas and Fatah will meet in Moscow to discuss the formation of a unified Palestinian government and the rebuilding of Gaza, the Russian news agency, RIA Novosti, reported on Wednesday, citing the Palestinian ambassador to Russia.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov also confirmed to RIA Novosti that such a meeting was planned.
Palestinian health officials said the death toll has surged to 29,954. Many others are buried beneath the rubble of ruined buildings across Gaza.

6,Pakistanis among UN peacekeepers pulling out from Congo,UN force set to leave its 14 bases and hand them over to DRC security forces before May.," 

Pakistani peacekeepers from the United Nations Organisation Mission for the Stabilisation of Congo are seen at their base in Kamanyola.—AFP

KAMANYOLA: The United Nations on Wednesday kicked off the withdrawal of MONUSCO peacekeeping forces from the Democratic Republic of Congo by handing over a first UN base to national police, an AFP team saw.
During an official ceremony at the Kamanyola base, close to the Rwandan and Burundian borders, the flags of the UN and Pakistan, the country of origin of the peacekeepers in charge, were replaced by those of the DRC.
 
 

The DRC demanded the withdrawal despite UN concerns about rampant violence in the east of the country.
Kinshasa considers the UN force to be ineffective in protecting civilians from the armed groups and militias that have plagued the east of the vast country for three decades.

UN force set to leave its 14 bases and hand them over to DRC security forces before May

The UN Security Council voted in December to accede to Kinshasa’s demand for a gradual pullout by the MONUSCO mission, which arrived in 1999. The UN force currently fields around 13,500 soldiers and 2,000 police across the three eastern provinces of Ituri, South Kivu and North Kivu.
The “disengagement plan” is due to take place in three phases with completion depending on regular assessments.
Phase one is to see the departure of military peacekeepers from South Kivu by the end of April and civilian staff by June 30. Before May, the UN force is to leave its 14 bases in the province and hand them over to DRC security forces.
It’s a “historic moment”, interim MONUSCO commander in chief Diouf Khar said in a speech. “We began with Kamanyola because there is stability here which allows us to leave,” the head of MONUSCO Bintou Keita told reporters.
After South Kivu, the second and third pullout phases will cover Ituri and North Kivu, with regular assessments of progress.
DRC Foreign Minister Christophe Lutundula has made it clear he wants the withdrawal completed by the end of this year, though the UN Security Council has not fixed a date.
‘Security vacuum’
The UN has insisted the DRC security forces must be reinforced and take care of civilians at the same time as MONUSCO pulls out.
Around six million people have been displaced by the fighting in DRC.
In Kamanyola, with a population of about 100,000, opinions appeared divided on the eve of the first step in the pullout. Ombeni Ntaboba, head of a local youth council, said he was not too concerned.
Every evening, he said, “we see them out in their armoured vehicles around the Ruzizi plain”, where armed groups operate along the border.
“But the level of insecurity is still the same, with armed robberies and kidnappings.”
“We salute the Congolese government’s decision,” said Mibonda Shingire, a rights activist, who admitted fearing the impact on the local economy because of the many people employed by MONUSCO.
Others, like Joe Wendo, said they were worried about a “security vacuum” once the Pakistani troops deployed to Kamanyola have gone.
“Their presence at least protected us from the Rwandan invaders,” he said.
The withdrawal comes with North Kivu facing the resurgent Tutsi-led M23 rebels who have seized swathes of territory.
Intense fighting resumed last month around the city of Goma, North Kivu’s capital. But local people shout down the UN troops more than they praise them.
And MONUSCO has recently felt the need to point out that it “supports Congo’s armed forces… defends its positions… facilitates secure passage for civilians”.
“The departure of the MONUSCO blue helmets concerns us, at a time when the country is at war with the rebels backed by our Rwandan neighbours,” said Beatrice Tubatunziye, who leads a development association in Kamanyola. She said she wanted to believe that Congolese forces “will quickly be able to fill the void”.
Kinshasa, the United Nations and Western countries say Rwanda supports M23 in a bid to control vast mineral resources in the region, an allegation Kigali denies.
