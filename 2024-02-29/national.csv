0,PSX’s top firms hit record profit,"Earnings surge 51% on strong performance by banking, energy sectors","The net profit earned by the top 100 performing companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) surged 51%, reaching a new record high of over Rs1.5 trillion in the year ended December 2023.
The major causes of depreciation in the domestic economy, namely high inflation rates, high interest rates, and rupee depreciation, provided a strong basis for different sectors to maintain a record high earning spree for another successive year. Among those making significant contributions to the overall profitability were banks, oil and gas exploration companies, and the power and fertiliser manufacturing sectors.
In a report titled ‘KSE-100 Index Profitability - CY23: Another year of record profitability, surpassing Rs1.5 trillion’, Arif Habib Limited (AHL) said “Dividends of KSE-100 companies (paid to shareholders) increased by 42% year-on-year to Rs547 billion in calendar year 2023.”
The PSX benchmark KSE-100 Index – comprising the top 100 performing companies – registered a 14-year high growth of 55% in 2023, mostly in the second half (Jul-Dec). The index closed the year at 62,451 points on December 29, emerging as the best-performing bourse in the year globally.
The index closed at 63,703 points on Wednesday after witnessing highs of CY24 at 64,822 points in late January and lows at 59,873 points in mid-February.
The research house reported that the outstanding growth in overall profitability during the year was attributable to an enormous surge of 82% in banks, 60% in oil and gas exploration companies, 55% in the power sector, and 47% in the fertiliser manufacturing sector.
It said the profitability of commercial banks posted an 82% year-on-year growth to Rs550 billion amid higher net interest income due to “elevated interest rates.”
To recall, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) jacked up its benchmark policy rate (interest rate) cumulatively by 15 percentage points to a record high of 22% in June 2023 from 7% in September 2021.
The central bank has maintained the policy rate at an all-time high of 22% since June 2023 to date to control stubborn inflation readings. The high interest rate helped the banks and the government achieve desired results in cooling down the then overheated economy. On the other hand, the high interest rate provided a basis for commercial banks to thrive in profitability and emerge as the best-earning sector among others.
Oil and gas exploration sector profitability soared 60% to Rs480 billion in 2023 “given currency depreciation, taxation reversal on depletion allowance, and exchange gains during the period,” according to the research house.
To recall, the domestic currency had depreciated almost 20% in 2023, closing the year near Rs282/$. It closed at over a four-month high at Rs279.12/$ on Wednesday.
AHL further said the power sector’s net profit climbed up by 55% to Rs77 billion. The major contribution to this growth comes from Hubco amid “the addition of local coal-based plants, a higher share of profit from associates and joint ventures, and rupee depreciation.”

The fertiliser sector’s profitability recorded 47% growth to Rs94 billion owing to 50% higher urea prices alongside a jump in DAP sales by 31%.
The cement sector’s bottom-line surged by 38% to Rs100 billion amid higher retention prices and lower coal prices, which offset the impact of volumetric decline (-1% YoY), a hike in energy tariffs, and currency depreciation.
The chemical sector’s earnings increased by 34% to Rs48 billion, primarily on account of a one-off gain booked by Lucky Core Industries Limited owing to the sale of NutriCo Morinaga.
Auto assemblers, facing a great depression in their sales, reported a growth of 72% in their net earnings to Rs20 billion in 2023 “due to a low base and better margins amid higher prices of passenger vehicles and tractors,” the research house said.
Refineries’ net profit climbed up by 8% to Rs26 billion owing to inventory gains. Engineering (Steel) profitability was up by 186% to Rs14 billion led by International Steels Limited (ISL) and International Industries Limited (INIL) amid better sales and margins.
The food and personal care sector’s earnings increased by 6% to Rs22 billion owing to higher sales alongside better margins.
The analysis was based on the financial results reported by 72 companies out of the total 100 in the index. The companies included in its analysis represent almost 83.4% of the market capitalisation of the benchmark bourse.
Local research houses projected in December 2023 and January 2024 that the benchmark KSE 100 Index would soar to 75,000-81,000 points by the end of December 2024 for three major reasons, including general elections (already held on February 8), likely significant cuts in the SBP policy rate, and the acquisition of the new International Monetary Fund loan programme after the current one ends in March-April 2024.
The elections, however, have failed to end political uncertainty as of yet, making the acquisition of the new IMF loan programme a tough job for the new coalition government in the making.

1,Oil gains on potential OPEC+ cuts,"Higher-for-longer rates could dampen economic growth, suppress demand for oil","Oil prices rose marginally on Wednesday as the prospect of delays to US interest rate cuts and a higher-than expected rise in US crude stocks offset support from a potential extension to OPEC+ supply cuts.
Brent crude futures edged up 14 cents to $83.79 a barrel by 1550 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate futures (WTI) gained 6 cents to reach $78.93. Both benchmarks had fallen $1 in earlier trading.

The early dips in prices were due to profit-taking plus a combined response to a reported surge in US crude stocks by the American Petroleum Institute this week and continuing hopes for a Gaza ceasefire deal in coming days, said Vandana Hari, founder of oil market analysis provider Vanda Insights.
US crude inventories rose by 4.2 million barrels last week, surpassing expectations of a 2.74 million barrel build, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday.
Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman had signalled on Tuesday that she was in no rush to cut US interest rates, particularly given continuing inflation risks. Higher-for-longer rates could dampen economic growth and suppress demand for oil.

2,"With loan rollover, rupee appreciates further",Currency touches new four-month high at Rs279.12 vs dollar,"Pakistani currency on Wednesday appreciated to a new four-month high at Rs279.12 to a dollar in the inter-bank market, drawing support from reports saying China had agreed to roll over $2 billion of deposits at the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
The rollover helped maintain Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves, held by the central bank, at the current level of slightly above $8 billion, which kept the rupee strong against foreign currencies.
According to SBP data, the domestic currency regained 0.05%, or Rs0.16, against the greenback compared to Tuesday’s negative close at Rs279.28/$.
With the latest gains, the currency has appreciated a net 10%, or almost Rs28, in the past over five and a half months compared to the all-time low close at Rs307.10/$ recorded in the first week of September 2023.
In addition to the Chinese loan rollover, the rupee also got support from a surge in supply of foreign currency amid increased remittances sent home by overseas Pakistanis to their families and relatives ahead of the arrival of Ramazan, and improved export earnings in the outgoing month of February.
Market talk suggests that exporters were selling US dollars at good margins on forward counters in the currency market keeping in view the outlook that the rupee may continue to gain further ground against the greenback.
In the open market, the rupee remained unchanged at Rs282.04/$ for the second consecutive working day, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).

Earlier, the retail market saw the local currency cumulatively shed Rs1.03 over two weeks in the wake of uptick in demand for US dollars, mainly from pilgrims going to perform Umrah.
The appreciation of the rupee in the inter-bank market and no change in its value in retail trade widened the difference between the two markets to Rs2.92 (or 1.05%).
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has provided a $3 billion standby facility to Pakistan, has recommended the maximum difference between currency values in the two markets at 1.25% (or around Rs4 at current levels).
In an important development, Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday left its credit rating for Pakistan unchanged at “Caa3”, indicating a high credit risk.
It raised doubts about the ability of the new government to quickly negotiate a new IMF loan programme soon after the ongoing one expires in April 2024. Moody’s maintained a “stable outlook” on Pakistan’s credit rating.

3,UK-Pakistan inward trade mission promotes ties,"Urges businesspeople to take advantage of DCTS, highlights favourable export climate","Leader of the United Kingdom-Pakistan Inward Trade Mission, Dr Michelle Kristy urged Karachi’s business community to seize the opportunities presented by the Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS) introduced by the UK. Kristy underscored the potential of the DCTS to enhance trade between the UK and Pakistan, highlighting the current favourable climate for exploring export opportunities.
Addressing a meeting during the visit of the UK-Pakistan Inward Trade Mission to the Karachi Chambers Commerce Industry (KCCI) on Wednesday, Kristy noted the diverse representation within the mission, which includes presidents and representatives of Chambers of Commerce in the UK. Their presence in Karachi aims to bolster bilateral trade relations between the UK and Pakistan, with subsequent visits planned for Lahore and Sialkot.
During the event, President KCCI Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh and President Greater Birmingham Chamber of Commerce Nasir Awan signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to foster trade and investment cooperation between the two countries.
The leader of the trade mission highlighted the recent launch of the International Trade Centre’s export handbook at the British Deputy High Commission in Karachi. She urged the KCCI to make the handbook available on its website, underscoring its potential benefit to Pakistani businesses seeking to export to the UK. Kristy expressed optimism about the visit’s outcome and called for continued collaboration between the UK government and Pakistani companies.
Chairman of the Businessmen Group, Zubair Motiwala, highlighted the historical ties between Pakistan and the UK. He expressed hope that the UK-Pakistan Inward Trade Mission would further enhance trade relations between the two countries. Motiwala outlined Pakistan’s diverse resources and highlighted opportunities for investment, particularly in the agriculture sector. He underscored the importance of value addition and technology transfer in boosting Pakistan’s exports.

He highlighted several initiatives by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), mentioning Pakistan’s invitation for investors to engage in the agriculture sector. Under SIFC’s initiative, investors are offered access to vast fertile land totalling 26 million hectares, provided at no cost. Investors retain possession as long as production continues, with only 30% of profits shared with the provincial government, he remarked.
The KCCI president highlighted Karachi’s role as an economic hub and expressed gratitude to the UK-Pakistan Trade Mission and the International Trade Centre (ITC) for organising the inward trade mission. Sheikh reiterated the commitment to facilitating productive business interactions between UK and Pakistani businesses.

4,Domestic consumers bear Rs17b subsidy cost,Provinces reluctant to pay cost of subsidised LNG supply to fertiliser plants,"As provinces refuse to bear the cost of subsidised liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply to two fertiliser plants, the caretaker government has put a burden of Rs17 billion on domestic consumers. The provinces want full recovery of LNG cost from the farmers.
The Petroleum Division was of the view that the continuation of re-gasified LNG supply at Rs1,239 per million British thermal units (mmbtu) from January to March 2024 involved estimated financial implication of Rs17 billion in terms of tariff differential with the notified RLNG price, which was $13 per mmbtu.
The decision made by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on November 23, 2023 had been conveyed to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), which said that as per the existing guidelines, they could only allow the recovery of RLNG volumes diverted to the domestic sector. Therefore, the guidelines for recovery of RLNG differential on account of supply at Rs1,239 per mmbtu may be reviewed.
The Petroleum Division proposed in a recent meeting of the ECC that the supply of RLNG to Fatima Fertiliser and Agritech Ltd be continued at Rs1,239 per mmbtu from January to March 2024 and the price differential be treated as RLNG diversion to the domestic sector for recovery through Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited’s (SNGPL) revenue requirement or through monthly RLNG pricing.
The ECC approved the proposal and an amount of Rs17 billion would be recovered from the domestic consumers.
The Petroleum Division informed policymakers that based on the directives of a meeting chaired by the prime minister and the apex committee of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), it had estimated the cost of urea production with the help of RLNG from January to March 2024 along with dispatches.

To finalise a mechanism for contribution by the provinces, a meeting, chaired by the petroleum secretary, was held with representatives of provinces on December 29, 2023.
However, none of the provinces agreed to contribute to the cost differential. Rather, they emphasised that RLNG may be supplied to both urea plants at full cost and the feriliser produced may accordingly be sold at a price that could recover the entire cost.
The Petroleum Division recalled that the ECC, in its meeting held on November 23, 2023, while considering a summary, had approved the continuation of RLNG supply to both the fertiliser plants, which were connected to the SNGPL network, from November 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 at a rate of Rs1,239 per mmbtu determined by Ogra.
The meeting was told that the price differential between Ogra’s notified price for RLNG and Rs1,239 per mmbtu would be included in the revenue requirement of SNGPL.
In addition, the prime minister chaired a meeting on December 11, 2023 to discuss matters pertaining to fertiliser production and supply. In the huddle, the chief secretaries of provincial governments were directed to contribute to the subsidy as per their share in gas dispatches to urea manufacturers from January to March 2024.
It was informed that the federal government contributed a subsidy of around Rs20 billion on RLNG supply to fertiliser plants. “Provinces must contribute by sharing the burden of subsidy, as agriculture is a provincial subject.”

5,Bulls hold firm grip over Moody’s report,"KSE-100 index gains 484.35 points, settles at 63,703.45","Bulls held sway over the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday as bullish momentum returned which helped the KSE-100 index gain nearly 500 points after Moody’s ratings agency maintained a stable outlook on Pakistan’s credit rating.
Earlier, the trading session began with a dip but soon bulls took over on optimism about the rating outlook.
The market got further boost from another development whereby the Bank of America (BofA) upgraded Pakistan’s Eurobonds to “overweight” status in the hope that the international rating agencies would upgrade the country’s credit rating.
Furthermore, continued recovery of the Pakistani rupee that reached a new four-month high at Rs279.12 against the US dollar aided the positive sentiment.
Extensive support came from exploration and production (E&P) and banking sectors as the KSE-100 index touched the intra-day high of 63,929.57 points.
The market, after remaining in the green for most of the session, closed above the 63,700 mark.
“Bullish activity was witnessed as investors weighed the summoning of National Assembly session for setting up a new government and Moody’s hint at rating upgrade on a reduction in government’s external and liquidity risks,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“BofA upgrading Pakistan’s bonds due to easing political uncertainty, government’s efforts to win up to $8 billion in IMF loan quota and rollover of $2 billion worth of Chinese debt played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded gains of 484.35 points, or 0.77%, and settled at 63,703.45.
Topline Securities’ Deputy Head of Sales Ali Najib, in his report, said it was “a good day” at the PSX.
“Pakistan equities’ market initiated business on a positive note and remained bullish almost throughout the session,” he said. “The buying momentum can be attributed to further clarity about the formation of a new government.”
In addition, there was news regarding likely upgrading of Pakistan’s rating if the government’s external and liquidity risks reduced, according to Moody’s.

Read PSX retreats as political noise rises
Owing to such developments, across-the-board buying was witnessed for most of the trading hours. Fertiliser, cement, bank and E&P sectors mainly contributed positively to the index as Fauji Fertiliser Company, Engro Fertilisers, Lucky Cement, MCB Bank and Oil and Gas Development Company added 314 points, he added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) remarked that the PSX was still stuck in the 63-64k congestion zone with the high capped at 63,900.
TRG Pakistan (-7.5%) following a loss in Q2 was the biggest downside contributor, it said.
Heading into the last trading session of the month, the KSE-100 was up 2.78% so far and “we have the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) rebalancing, which is expected to see inflows in Interloop, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines and Bank AL Habib following their inclusion in the main FM (Frontier Market) Standard Index”, AHL added.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal said the market displayed a positive trend throughout the day with notable activity in banking and oil exploration sectors.
“Going forward, a cautious approach is recommended and investors are advised to sell on strength,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 461.4 million shares against Tuesday’s tally of 409.96 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs16 billion.
Shares of 355 companies were traded. Of these, 180 stocks closed higher, 149 dropped and 26 remained unchanged.
Cnergyico PK was the volume leader with trading in 62.2 million shares, gaining Rs0.34 to close at Rs4.39. It was followed by K-Electric with 45.5 million shares, gaining Rs0.27 to close at Rs4.79 and Hascol Petroleum with 30.5 million shares, gaining Rs0.69 to close at Rs7.98.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs825.5 million, according to the NCCPL.

6,SK hydropower project begins reservoir filling,"Key milestone for CPEC, serves as first step of Belt and Road Initiative","The reservoir filling of the Suki Kinari Hydropower Project started successfully on Wednesday, marking the completion of another significant milestone and laying a solid foundation for the scheduled power generation target of the project.
According to a press statement issued on Wednesday, the project has mainly been invested by China Gezhouba Group Overseas Investment Company, belonging to China Energy Engineering Corporation (CEEC). The important moment of reservoir filling was witnessed by owners of SK Project Company, engineers, personnel, and other construction participants.
The dam of the project is an asphalt concrete core-wall rock-fill dam with a crest elevation of 2,239.5 metres, a maximum height of 54.5 metres, a crest width of 10 metres, a length of 258 metres, and a total backfill volume of about 1.9 million cubic metres, the statement added.
During construction, SK Project Company efficiently coordinated all construction participants, optimised the design schemes, accelerated the construction period, and achieved the dam capping target in May 2023 as scheduled.

After capping, the SK Project Company led the relating parties in the commissioning of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) work, reservoir area slope support and other related work, and finally started the reservoir filling as scheduled with several months’ efforts.
The project is included in the first batch of priority projects list of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which serves as the first step of the “Belt and Road” Initiative. It is currently the largest greenfield hydropower overseas project invested by Chinese enterprises, and has drawn great attention from the Chinese and Pakistan governments and all sectors of society.
So far, the overall construction progress of the project exceeds 98%.

7,"NEPRA puts livelihoods at risk, say traders",Businesses face closure with terrible increase in input costs,"The business community, distraught by the increasing cost of inputs, has appealed to the government to stop the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) from taking anti-people and anti-business decisions as businesses are on the verge of collapse, putting livelihoods of millions of people at risk.
Now, there is no need to go on strike to protest the surging energy tariffs, because industries will eventually close down, which will also deal a blow to the country’s exports, it warned.
Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh denounced Nepra’s decision that allowed a tariff hike of Rs7.0562 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) as fuel charges adjustment for January 2024.
In a statement, he emphasised that it was highly unfair to allow an additional tariff of Rs7.0562 per kWh to be charged from all categories of consumers with the excuse of variation in fuel charges.
“All the citizens and members of business community have already paid their bills for January 2024, therefore, Nepra has advised to collect the variation in fuel charges for January 2024 under a separate head in the bills of March 2024, which will not only affect the budget of almost all households but also terribly increase the cost for all types of manufacturing units,” he said.
Sheikh pointed out that the circular debt had continued to surge and crossed Rs5.73 trillion only because efforts were hardly being made to control theft and line losses. “They are trying to avert further increase in circular debt by raising tariffs, which is an unwise move as the hefty bills will worsen the situation by encouraging many to steal electricity.”

Read NEPRA orders inquiry into power rate hike demand
Talking to The Express Tribune, Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry President Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani said, “The intricate economic web woven by loans and the government’s inclination towards seeking new loans for debt settlement is not a product of independent decision-making, rather it reflects the current state of affairs in Pakistan.”
Fulminating against Nepra for a drastic increase in electricity tariff, he dubbed the authority a manipulated entity that burdened both traders and the public with billions of rupees in the name of fuel charges adjustment. Shaikhani pointed out that during winter, electricity consumption had already been reduced to half, with a mere 12,000 megawatts being utilised from the grid along with 10 to 12 hours of load-shedding.
He asked for urgently reviewing the contracts signed with independent power producers (IPPs) with a view to rescuing the national economy in the larger interest of the country.

8,"Bitcoin hits $60,000 as rally gathers pace",Marks largest monthly gain since Dec 2020 as ETF traded product price jumps 42%,"Bitcoin hit $60,000 on Wednesday for the first time in more than two years, as a flurry of capital into new US spot bitcoin exchange traded products fuelled a 42% price rally in February, which would mark its largest monthly gain since December 2020.
Bitcoin was last up 6% at $60,131, its highest since November 2021, when it hit a record just below $70,000. Bitcoin was also heading for its largest week-on-week gain in a year, up 18.5% since February 21.
Traders have poured into bitcoin ahead of April’s halving event – a process designed to slow the release of the cryptocurrency. In addition, the prospect of the Federal Reserve delivering a series of rate cuts this year has fed investor appetite for higher-yielding or more volatile assets. “Bitcoin is being driven by the support of consistent inflows into the new spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and outlook for April’s halving event and June’s Fed interest rate cuts,” Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at retail investment platform eToro, said.
The value of all the bitcoin in circulation has topped $2 trillion this month for the first time in two years, according to crypto platform CoinGecko, while the price of the token itself has doubled in just four months.
The bigger bitcoin ETFs have seen a definite pickup in interest this week.
The three most popular, run by Grayscale, Fidelity and BlackRock, have seen trading volumes surge.
On Monday and Tuesday, around 110 million shares in the biggest three changed hands, about 51% of the 215 million shares traded in the market’s most valuable companies – Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia, according to LSEG data.

Three weeks ago, this percentage was closer to 15%.
“Essentially, we’re seeing the ETF effect ahead of schedule. Inflows into them stepped up quickly last week and have been sustained, and we think it’s reflective of advisors getting out there very quickly to start selling the ETFs to clients,” Joseph Edwards, head of research at Enigma Securities, said.
LSEG data showed flows into the 10 largest spot bitcoin ETFs brought in $420 million on Tuesday alone, the most in almost two weeks.
“If $60,000 doesn’t whet the appetite, consider that 70% of bitcoin supply has remained unmoved for a year, and the little that’s left is being hoovered up by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity, just as rewards for miners are about to be slashed in half. The stars are aligning for bitcoin,” cofounder of Nexo crypto exchange Antoni Trenchev said.

9,Reliance on renewables a must,"Experts stress grid modernisation, local manufacturing for growth","Pakistan’s ambitious renewable energy plans need to be coupled with close attention to addressing the system’s constraints to reduce the volume of unserved energy on the one hand and accommodate the intermittency of renewable energy on the other.
This was the consensus reached at a webinar titled “Emerging trends in Pakistan’s renewable energy sector: Charting the agenda for 2030 and beyond,” organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).
Highlighting the current challenges faced by the power sector and the milestones needed to achieve a stable and sustainable energy ecosystem, speakers underscored that the addition of renewable energy is non-negotiable in today’s climate. However, this should be coupled with the modernisation of the grid.
K-Electric’s Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Sadia Dada shared an overview of KE’s Investment Plan, which had already been submitted to the regulator. She outlined the company’s plans to expand the utility’s transmission and distribution capacity, preparing it to accommodate approximately 1200 MW of renewable energy by FY2030 as envisioned under the utility’s Power Acquisition Programme (PAP). She maintained that these programmes are being developed in alignment with national targets under the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP) and entail a long-term, optimal cost strategy plan for the expansive growth of power generation within a set of prevailing policies and technical and socio-economic considerations.
“In the next seven years, we aim to reduce our reliance on imported fuels to 51% while increasing our dependence on green sources to 49%. We must look at our approach in a holistic manner because our priority is to maintain energy security for our customers. We’ve seen that climate change is impacting countries which were previously relying heavily on renewable energy, making it difficult to maintain grid stability,” she said. “Cities like Karachi also present a unique case study, where we see power demands peaking twice in a 24-hour period, which requires a case-specific approach.”
Energy Consultant Dr Irfan Ahmed believes that renewable energy projects are front-loaded and require upfront heavy investments. He noted that Pakistan needed to be ‘self-reliant’ and would eventually have to opt for local manufacturing due to foreign exchange constraints. He maintained that Pakistan’s electrical network is ‘bumpy,’ leading to frequent damage to electrical plants and revenue loss. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that non-operational plants are repaired locally and spare parts are produced for sustainable operations to avoid ongoing problems.

Read Call for holistic renewable energy transition
Dr Khalid Waleed, an SDPI Research Fellow, said that the country’s transition to renewable energy should be gradual and orderly to prevent creating more problems for the energy ecosystem. He further emphasised the need to create a conducive environment and explore distribution generation models to effectively bridge the gap between load and generation centres. This requires national dialogues to shore up investor confidence in transmission and distribution projects, he added.
Renewable Energy Expert Fozan Waheed discussed how sudden curtailments in wind power projects jeopardise the grid and make it prone to blackouts. Citing international examples, he mentioned that China invests up to $75 billion in their grid to ensure long-term energy security. He further stated that the sustainability and success of Pakistan’s energy sector rely on learning from the best practices of leaders in the energy space and preparing a forward-looking strategy that addresses the country’s specific needs.
Amreli Steels Limited, Head of Energy & Sustainability, Abubakar Ismail remarked that more industries are embracing solar power with increasing interest in wind and biomass energy sources. However, current economic conditions pose significant challenges to investment across all sectors, including renewable energy. He added that fostering growth and development in the renewable energy sector requires economic and political stability. Open access policies and the implementation of the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM) are crucial steps towards enhancing energy adoption in Pakistan, promoting competition, efficiency, and transparency in the energy market, ultimately benefiting consumers and producers.
The session concluded with a vote of thanks to all participants by Ubaidur Rehman Zia, the moderator of the session and Senior Research Associate & Head of the Energy Unit at SDPI.
