0,CDA plans Rs2bn project to reforest Margalla Hills,"Civic agency aims to plant 10m trees, build check dams, hire guards for national park.","ISLAMABAD: In a bid to enhance the biodiversity and green cover in Margalla Hills, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has prepared a PC-1 for a project worth over Rs2 billion to plant 10 million trees in the park.
The CDA is in process of sending the PC-I to the federal government to secure funding in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25 under the public sector development programme, with the cost estimated at Rs2,158.614 million.
Islamabad is a stretch of over an area of 908 sq. kilometres in which – as per the master plan – Margalla Hills and 32 acquired villages consist of 39,000 acres of land which was declared as a national park in the 1980s.
The park is located on the northern edge of Islamabad, south of the Haripur district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, extending over 15,782.74 hectares (39,000 acres).

Civic agency aims to plant 10m trees, build check dams, hire guards for national park

The PC-I for the project ‘Enhancing the biodiversity and green cover by managing the natural resources, maintenance and rehabilitation of the landscape of Margalla Hills National Park’ has been prepared by the environment wing of the CDA and it will be implemented over five years.
‘To enhance Flora and fauna’
According to the PC-I, the main objective of the project is to “enhance the flora and fauna” of the national park and its preservation for the attraction of the public and tourists.
 
 

The PC-I claims that the project will also be helpful in the “mitigation of climate change” and through this project, the CDA will improve the aesthetics of the national park.
“Being home to a variety of flora and fauna, this national park not only provides recreation and research opportunities but also plays a vital role in maintaining the environment of the capital… The proximity to the capital has further increased the government in protecting and improving the soil, flora and fauna of the national park,” reads the document.
“High birth rate and shifting of settlements from other corners of the country, Islamabad city is rapidly losing the green cover due to construction activities and facing various other environmental issues: one is depleting groundwater,” the PC-I document reads.
According to the PC-I, at present two invasive species i.e. lantana and paper mulberry cover 7,150 acres of land of the park which are obstructing local species.
Similarly, these mountains have their watershed value and main source of fresh water but due to less green cover most of the water is going to waste due to high run-off, it reads.
The PC-I said that preference will be given to local species such as ‘chir pine’, ‘amaltas’ and ‘kachnar’ and guards will also be hired for the protection of trees.
The CDA also plans to construct check dams and water ponds in the park.
Speaking to Dawn, the member environment said that all aspects were covered in the PC-I. This project is imperative for improving biodiversity and green cover in the federal capital, he said, adding that it will have far-reaching impacts.
The PC-I, besides others, was signed by Director General Environment Qaiser Khattak, Member Environment Shahzad Khalil, and CDA Chairman Anwarul Haq.

ISLAMABAD: National Assembly (NA) Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf has said that the Constitution will continue to be a guiding document for generations to come and will lead the country on a path of development and progress.
“It is the Constitution that creates a strong link between state and people,” Mr Ashraf said while inaugurating Yadgar-i-Dastoor (Constitution Monument) and Bagh-i-Dastoor in front of Parliament House.
He underscored Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to democracy and steadfast adherence to the principles enshrined in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Mr Ashraf stated that the monument would continue to remind us about the significance and sanctity of the Constitution.
He further noted that the country’s progress and development are interlinked with adhering to the constitution.
“Yadgar-i-Dastoor and Bagh-i-Dastoor are first of their kind in the constitutional and political history of Pakistan,” the NA speaker said, adding that standing tall at the heart of the nation, the Yadgar-i-Dastoor monument embodies the sanctity of the 1973 Constitution with its towering plaques bearing the Preamble and fundamental rights.
Mr Ashraf said: “The Islamic motif framing the constitution reminds of Article 227, which states that all existing laws shall be brought into conformity with the injunctions of Islam. As the national flag waves high, symbolising a constant reminder of every citizen’s solemn duty to uphold loyalty and obedience to the constitution and the law, a fountain nearby represents the balance of power.
Amidst lush greenery, each tree planted in Bagh-i-Dastoor signifies an article of the constitution, while the parliament, at the centre, echoes its pivotal role in governance,” he added.
Moreover, the NA speaker paid rich tribute to all members of the Advisory Committee who conceived and approved the design of the Constitution Monument, especially Mian Raza Rabbani, Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Azam Nazeer Tarar, Kamran Murtaza, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Agha Hassan Baloch, Amir Haider Azam Khan, Dr Nafisa Shah, Dr. Mohammad Afzal Khan Dhandla, Ms Wajha Qamar, Engr. Sabir Hussain Kaim Khani, Khalid Hussain Magsi, Mehnaz Akbar Aziz, Mohsin Dawar, Asiya Azeem, Ramesh Kumar, former senator Farhatullah Babar and Zafrullah Khan.

Speaking at the farewell party organised by the head association and teachers to acknowledge the services of 70 vice principals and principals who retired during the last two years, President Head Association Fazal-e-Mola and President Teacher Association Malik Ameer demanded the government to release pending hiring dues.
They said that pending dues of employees working in schools and colleges of FDE had been causing unrest among the teaching and non-teaching staff. Malik Ameer said many teachers have been waiting to get the hiring amount for the last three years, which is a great injustice to them.
Teachers also demanded the government restore honorariums for the teaching community as well.
They said that in the past, both teachers and non-teaching staff used to get honorariumsfor their outstanding services. But now, this practice has been stopped for teachers, which should be restored.
They also stated that principals of schools are getting Rs 50 per month against charge allowance, which is something highly condemnable, and charge allowance should be increased up to Rs 5000.
Mr Ameer said that in 2017, the then DG FDE decided that instead of Rs 50, the college and school heads would be given Rs 5000 and 4000, respectively, but that those orders had not been implemented yet.
The Special Secretary of Education Mohyuddin Ahmad Wani, attended the farewell ceremony as the chief guest. He said that teachers have been playing an important role in nation-building.
He also said that under the supervision of Federal Secretary of Education Waseem Ajmal Chaudhry, special steps are being taken to bring improvement to Islamabad’s education sector. “Currently, 200 schools are being upgraded; new IT labs, arts labs, etc. are being setup,” he said, adding that special focus is being paid on teacher training as well.
In response to the demands of the teaching community, he said that all legitimate issues involving teachers would be resolved on a priority basis.
