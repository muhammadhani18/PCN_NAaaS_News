0,"PHF releases part payment of players, staff members",President urges players to focus on their performance while noting that the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup was round the corner.,"LAHORE: After a considerable delay of eight months, the cash-strapped Pakistan Hockey Fede­ration (PHF) on Monday finally issued the first installment of the arrears of senior and junior players and staff members.
While the players and the federation’s staff had been waiting for the last eight months to get their dues, the tussle between two groups to get control of the PHF — with almost nothing in its bank accounts which had been blocked — only prolonged the financial suffering of the players and the staff.
On Monday, PHF president Tariq Hussain Bugti, in his meetings with nati­onal senior team captain Ammad Shakeel Butt and skipper of the junior side Hanan Shahid Butt, ensu­red them that all the dues would be cleared soon.
Speaking on the occasion, Bugti asked the players to focus on their performance while noting that the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup was round the corner. The PHF president urged them to forget the past and prepare themselves for the future.

2,Undav salvages point for Stuttgart in thriller,"STUTTGART: Deniz Undav’s thrilling equaliser eight minutes into added time salvaged a point for VfB Stuttgart, who...","STUTTGART: Deniz Undav’s thrilling equaliser eight minutes into added time salvaged a point for VfB Stuttgart, who settled for a 3-3 draw with Heidenheim in the Bundesliga on Sunday. 
Heidenheim fought back from two goals down to take the lead when Tim Kleindienst scored twice within a minute, but were not able to hold on to clinch their first win in six matches. 
The hosts took the lead in the 41st minute through Serhou Guirassy who scored from Angelo Stiller’s cross from the left to take his goal tally to 23 in the league, second only to Bayern Munich’s Harry Kane. 
Stiller doubled the lead in the 53rd minute, chasing Undav’s through ball into the box and finishing with his left foot to earn his first goal for Stuttgart. 
Heidenheim got a goal back nine minutes later when Stuttgart keeper Alexander Nubel spilled Kleindienst’s header off a corner into his own net. 
Kleindienst got the equaliser for Heidenheim in the 84th minute, burying Jan-Niklas Beste’s pass into the net with his left foot, scoring his first league goal since February. 
The forward struck again a minute later as Eren Dinkci set him up for a header from close range, sending thousands of visiting Heidenheim fans delirious with joy as the visitors took a 3-2 lead. 
But the hosts turned it around deep into added time when Maximilian Mittelstadt found Undav in the centre of the box for a right-footed finish. 
Heidenheim remain 11th with 30 points ahead of facing second-placed Bayern at home next weekend. 
Third placed Stuttgart, three points behind Bayern with 57 points, are four points ahead of fourth-placed Borussia Dortmund whom they visit on Saturday. 
In Sunday’s late game, rock-bottom Darmstadt came from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Bochum. 
A Philipp Hofmann double put the home side in control but a 62nd-minute Tim Skarke goal and an Oscar Vilhelmsson strike with 14 minutes remaining levelled the scores. 
Despite the point, Darmstadt are 12 points from safety with seven games left and look set for immediate relegation, having not won since October. 
Earlier on Sunday, Augsburg drew 1-1 at home with Cologne to regain seventh spot in the Bundesliga, and remain on course for a return to European football. 
Arne Maier gave the home side the lead after 18 minutes, but Davie Selke’s 33rd-minute goal levelled the scores for the visitors. 
Augsburg came into the game on a four-match winning streak and could qualify for Europe for the first time since 2015-16. 
Depending on UEFA rankings and German Cup results, seventh spot may be enough for a Europa Conference League place. 
The point was cold comfort for Cologne, who are stranded in second-last place, six points from safety with seven games remaining.

3,"Rodrygo keeps Real clear of Barca, Girona boost CL dream","MADRID: Rodrygo netted a goal in each half as Real Madrid secured a 2-0 home win against Athletic Bilbao on Sunday,...","MADRID: Rodrygo netted a goal in each half as Real Madrid secured a 2-0 home win against Athletic Bilbao on Sunday, cementing their position at the top of the La Liga table. 
Carlo Ancelotti’s Real have 75 points, eight ahead of Barcelona in second and 10 clear of third-placed Girona with eight matches left. The result hit fourth-placed Bilbao’s hopes of securing a place in next season’s Champions League as they are only one point ahead of Atletico Madrid. 
Without suspended Brazil forward Vinicius Junior, his compatriot Rodrygo made the difference with two superb strikes at the Santiago Bernabeu. 
Rodrygo broke the deadlock after eight minutes, calmly curling the ball into the far corner after a composed run to the edge of the box, as the Bilbao defence failed to close down the Brazilian winger. 
Aurelien Tchouameni almost found the net with a powerful header from a corner just before halftime, but the ball narrowly missed the target, denying Real another goal. 
In the 73rd minute, Rodrygo was played free on the wing by Jude Bellingham, returning after a two-match suspension for dissent, on a counter-attack, giving him time and space to run into the box and guide the ball into the bottom corner. 
“He played very well, he made the difference, he was able to score early, he has a lot of quality in his moves, it’s what he has to do,” Ancelotti told reporters. 
Ancelotti said he was not concerned that Rodrygo, who had only netted once in his last 13 matches across all competitions, was inconsistent in front of goal. 
“There are very isolated cases of forwards who score all the time, like [Karim] Benzema or Cristiano [Ronaldo],” continued the Italian. “With experience Rodrygo will improve in that aspect, he’s still young and plays with a lot of intensity, and sometimes because of that youth I ask him to do a lot of work, so that’s why sometimes he’s not as fresh in front of goal.” 
In stoppage time, the Santiago Bernabeu crowd warmly applauded Eder Militao, who returned to the field for Real after being sidelined since August due to an ACL injury. 
Ancelotti was happy to see his Brazilian defender back in action. 
“We are talking about one of the best defenders in the world and he is important for us,” he said. “He needs time to adapt and get back to playing. We’ll need him in this final stretch of the season.” 
Real will next host Manchester City in a highly anticipated first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on April 9. 
“We know them very well, but we’re going to focus on our game. We need to bring more intensity than we did today, but we still have time,” Ancelotti added. 
Earlier Cristhian Stuani’s last-gasp strike earned Girona an entertaining 3-2 win over Real Betis, keeping the minnows on track for Champions League qualification. 
Michel Sanchez’s Girona had fallen badly out of form after running Real close in the title race for most of the season, but Stuani’s late goal earned them an important win that moved them nine points ahead of Bilbao. 
Two David Lopez errors gifted Betis forward Willian Jose two goals to twice equalise goals from Girona forward Artem Dovbyk but veteran Uruguayan forward Stuani had the final say. 
“Until [qualification] is mathematically sealed, we’ll keep working and preparing for matches as if they were the last,” Stuani told DAZN. “We’re on a good path, living through a historic year and let’s finish it in the best way we can.” 
The hosts went ahead when Chadi Riad handled Dovbyk’s header and the Ukrainian netted the resulting penalty, before Jose lobbed home the equaliser. 
Girona edged back in front with a good move finished by Dovbyk for his 16th goal, putting him level with Bellingham and Mallorca’s Ante Budimir as La Liga’s top scorer. 
Betis were soon level after Lopez’s poor attempt at a clearance allowed Jose to strike, but Stuani pounced acrobatically in stoppage time to help Girona take their European dream one step closer to reality.

4,Record stand helps England women to victory over NZ,WELLINGTON: A record seventh-wicket stand by Amy Jones and Charlie Dean helped bail England out of trouble and ...,"WELLINGTON: A record seventh-wicket stand by Amy Jones and Charlie Dean helped bail England out of trouble and secure a four-wicket win over New Zealand in Wellington on Monday in the first One-day International of a three-match series.
After being put in to bat, New Zealand posted a total of 207 and took wickets at a consistent rate early on to leave England reeling at 79-6.
England were eventually rescued by Jones (92 not out) and Dean (42 not out), who guided the visitors over the finish line with their assured partnership.
The unbeaten 130-run stand between the pair bettered the previous record of 122 between India’s Sneh Rana and Pooja Vastrakar against Pakistan in a 2022 Women’s World Cup match at Mount Maunganui.
“Me and Deano were constantly saying, ‘one ball at a time’ and ‘just react’, which kept us in the moment. I thought we played with freedom and did what we set out to,” Jones told reporters.
“For that to pay off, [this innings] ranks quite highly I’d say.” 
The teams meet in the second ODI at Seddon Park in Hamilton, New Zealand on Thursday.

5,PSG overcome red card to win at Marseille and take step closer to title,MARSEILLE: Portuguese duo Vitinha and Goncalo Ramos scored in the second half as 10-man Paris St Germain overcame...,"MARSEILLE: Portuguese duo Vitinha and Goncalo Ramos scored in the second half as 10-man Paris St Germain overcame early jitters to secure a 2-0 win and hand bitter rivals Olympique de Marseille their first home loss of the season in Ligue 1 on Sunday. 
PSG’s league double over their rivals took them to 62 points and put them 12 points clear of second-placed Brest, who won 1-0 at Lorient earlier in the day. 
“Yes, I’m happy with the result, because it’s a classic,” PSG manager Luis Enrique said. “We know it’s special for our supporters. We knew the pressure in this stadium where they were undefeated.” 
PSG endured a frustrating first half at a rainy Stade Velodrome as Marseille’s defence nullified the league’s leading goal-scorer Kylian Mbappe until he was substituted just after the hour mark. 
Lucas Beraldo was sent off five minutes before the break, after a challenge on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang by the touchline that the referee deemed to be denying a goalscoring opportunity after a VAR review despite it happening near the halfway line. 
But Vitinha opened the scoring for the league leaders in the 53rd minute, running through the middle and playing a one-two with Ousmane Dembele before firing home from near the penalty spot. 
Marseille thought they had equalised six minutes later when Luis Henrique found the net but his effort was ruled out for offside. 
Marseille pressed hard with Aubame­yang and Faris Moumb­agna creating several chances, but PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnar­umma made 10 saves in the match to ensure a clean sheet. 
Ramos ended the hosts’ comeback hopes in the 85th minute with Marco Asensio setting him up for a right-footed finish that silenced the Stade Velodrome. 
“There’s always this desire to be unpredictable for opponents,” Enrique said. “I liked what I saw in terms of occupying space. If you don’t know where my players are going to play, it’s a surprise.” 
Marseille remain seventh with 39 points,, three points away from the European places. 
Brest remain on course for Champions League qualification after beating Brittany rivals Lorient thanks to a late Romain Del Castillo goal. 
They held on for the victory despite having Billal Brahimi sent off in stoppage time, and the result lifted them back up into second place above Monaco. Brest, who have never qualified for Europe, are four points better off than fourth-placed Lille. 
The top three in Ligue 1 will qualify automatically for next season’s expanded Champions League, with fourth place entering in the preliminary rounds. 
Nice remain fifth despite losing 2-1 at home to struggling Nantes, whose winner came from a late penalty by Egypt striker Mostafa Mohamed. 
Second in the table at the season’s halfway stage, Nice have now won just once in their last eight league games. 
The result takes Nantes, in their first game since Antoine Kombouare returned for a second spell as coach, out of the relegation play-off place, with Lorient replacing them. 
Rennes saw their prospects of European qualification dealt a blow in a 2-0 defeat away to Patrick Vieira’s Strasbourg, while there were also wins for Montpellier and Toulouse.

6,Ice-cool Sinner downs Dimitrov to clinch Miami Open title,"MIAMI: Italy’s Jannik Sinner won the ATP Miami Open Masters 1000 title on Sunday with a dominant 6-3, 6-1 victory...","MIAMI: Italy’s Jannik Sinner won the ATP Miami Open Masters 1000 title on Sunday with a dominant 6-3, 6-1 victory over Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov in the final at Hard Rock Stadium.
Sinner’s third title of the season means he will move to a career-high second in the ATP world rankings on Monday ahead of Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz.
And the manner of his performance, ice-cool throughout with errors at a minimum and winners struck with sure-fire confidence, suggests that when Novak Djokovic finally surrenders the top spot, Sinner and Alcaraz are set to battle for supremacy for years to come.
Sinner finishes the hard court season in electric form, having won 25 of his last 26 matches — the only defeat coming to Alcaraz in the semi-final of Indian Wells.
He added the Miami title to his crowns this year at the Australian Open and the Rotter­dam Indoors after taking care of business in 72 minutes.
Sinner never looked in danger after he broke in the fifth game of the first set, facing just one break point in the entire match.
“As this tournament went on, I felt better and better. Today’s performance was really good. I’m just proud of how I handled the situation,” Sinner said.
“I started the season really, really well. I never thought [I would] start like this. Being number two is an amazing feeling.”
Sinner clinched the first set with his second break, a brilliant backhand down the line that brought spectators to their feet.
Dimitrov, with his trademark one-handed backhand strokes and willingness to go to the net, was enjoying plenty of support from the home crowd but Sinner’s calm approach and pristine technique was too much for him.
The Italian broke in the second set to go 3-1 up and with his serve strong and returns rock solid, it was a procession to victory from that point.
Sinner’s Australian co-coach Darren Cahill, whose past pupils include Andre Agassi and Simona Halep, was hugely impressed with the way his player approached the match.
“I thought he was incredible today, barely any unforced errors, kept a great depth and kept it difficult for Grigor to win points. If Grigor did win points, he did so with spectacular tennis,” Cahill said.
“He made Grigor force a lot and take a lot of risks and when he’s doing that I know Jannik is playing the right way. Tactically, I thought he was great today.”
Dimitrov had no doubt he had lost to a man in supreme form.
“I think at the moment clearly Jannik is playing outstanding tennis. There is nothing to say to that. You see how focused he is, how determined he is, the way he’s hitting his shots, there is zero doubt,” said Dimitrov.
“Can he play any better? I don’t know. He’s the one to show that. But at the moment he has been able to really put so many matches back to back with the same level, so all credit goes to him.
“And he’s the best player right now in the world.”
The Italian’s title came in his third appearance in a Miami final — he lost to Poland’s Hubert Hurkacz in 2021 and Daniil Medvedev last year.
Sinner’s previous Masters 1000 title came in Toronto in 2023.
Dimitrov will return to the top 10 in Monday’s rankings for the first time since October 2018.
The 32-year-old’s run to the Miami final included a quarter-final win over Alcaraz and a semi-final victory over world number five Alexander Zverev.
“I just want to focus on the positives this week,” he said.  “I was extremely determined throughout the whole week.
“Clearly it’s Jannik’s week. He has been playing amazing tennis. It’s really impressive how he’s been able to keep that way of playing.
“I don’t think I have much time to be down on myself. I just want to embrace this moment as well. Just as you win, you need to be able to handle [losing] matches like that, I think, even better than winning those type of matches.”

7,Sri Lanka reign supreme despite second innings batting blues,"The tourists decided against enforcing a follow-on but were left struggling with their batting in the second innings, reaching 102-6 at stumps.","

CHITTAGONG: Asitha Fernando claimed 4-34 as Sri Lanka bowled out Bangladesh for 178 to take a massive 353-run lead in the first innings of the second Test in Chittagong on Monday.
The tourists decided against enforcing a follow-on but were left struggling with their batting in the second innings, reaching 102-6 at stumps on the third day to extend their lead to 455 runs.
Debutant pacer Hasan Mahmud gave Bangladesh something to smile about with 4-51, while fellow pacer Khaled Ahmed also troubled the Sri Lankan batsmen with 2-29.
But Angelo Mathews remained unbeaten on 39 alongside Prabath Jayasuriya, three not out, with the pair looking to extend Sri Lanka’s lead with the help of the tail-enders.
Lahiru Kumara, Vishwa Fernando and Jayasuriya earlier chipped in with two each as Sri Lanka claimed nine wickets in two sessions to leave the hosts flattened.
Sri Lanka fast bowling coach Dharshana Gamage praised both sides.
“Both teams’ bowlers, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, bowled really well,” Gamage said.
“We need to score another 50-60 runs, then we will be in a good position. I am pretty sure our bowlers will fight back.”
Zakir Hasan made the highest score for Bangladesh with 54, while Mominul Haque offered some resistance with 33.
“We totally failed with the bat,” Zakir said.  “We couldn’t perform our roles, we didn’t play as we were supposed to play.”
Resuming on 55-1 with nightwatchman Taijul Islam, Zakir survived for more than an hour before Bangladesh lost their first wicket of the day.
Sri Lanka ended Bangladesh’s dogged early resistance when Vishwa Fernando, a left-arm quick, swung one in to uproot the leg stump of Zakir.
Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto looked edgy from the start and faced 11 balls before being dismissed by Jayasuriya for one.
Najmul departed after attempting an on-drive, which was caught at short midwicket by Dimuth Karunaratne.
Vishwa Fernando bowled Taijul for 22 with another in-swinging delivery to reduce Bangladesh to 105-4.
Asitha Fernando trapped Shakib Al Hasan leg-before for 15 and then induced an edge from Liton Das (four) in the same over.
Bangladesh kept losing wickets in clusters.
Shahadat Hossain (eight) was caught by Kamindu Mendis at slip off Kumara and Jayasuriya hit Mehidy Hasan (seven) in front.
Asitha Fernando ended Mominul’s defiant innings before he bowled Khaled for one to wrap up the innings.
Sri Lanka dominated Bangladesh in the first two days to amass 531, the highest Test total without any batsman scoring a century.
Sri Lanka, who have never lost a Test series to Bangla­desh, won the first Test in Sylhet by 328 runs.

THIS handout photograph released by the Pakistan Cricket Board on Monday shows PCB chairman Mohsin Raza Naqvi meeting with fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi during his visit to the national team’s fitness camp at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul as fellow pacer Mohammad Amir looks on.—AFP

 
LAHORE: With the fallout from the abrupt change of captain seemingly lingering on, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi made the trip to Kakul on Monday to visit the Pakistan team camp at the Army School of Physical Training and settle matters once and for all.
The PCB announced on Sunday that star batter Babar Azam would be returning as Pakistan’s white-ball captain ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup in June, replacing Shaheen Shah Afridi as the skipper in the shortest format of the game after the pacer had led the side in just one series. 
While the statements from both Babar and Shaheen made it look that the change at the helm had been cordial, longstanding reports that the latter had not been taken into confidence were confirmed on Monday when it emerged that Shaheen had an issue with the quotes attributed to him. 
“There was a misunderstanding between the PCB media department and Shaheen over his quotes in Sunday’s news release,” sources told Dawn on Monday, “as Shaheen hadn’t sent any statement”. 
In the statement, Shaheen was quoted as saying that he had “nothing but respect for Babar” and that “we are all one”. 
Sources close to Shaheen had been quoted as saying in several reports that the fast bowler had resented being replaced after just one series.
Adding fuel to the fire was a social media post on Sunday by Shaheen’s father-in-law and former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi. 
“I am surprised by the decision by very experienced cricketers in the selections committee,” Afridi wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “I still believe that if change was necessary than [Mohammad] Rizwan was the best choice. But since now the decision has been made I offer my full support and best wishes to team Pakistan and Babar Azam.” 
During Mohsin’s visit, he did not meet Shaheen separately although the PCB released a photograph in which the two were seen greeting each other with a smile, indicating that things had now been settled. 
PCB’s news release did not elaborate on any talks between Mohsin and Shaheen. 
“The visit [was] aimed at gathering firsthand insights into the training camp and to extend gratitude to the Pakistan Army for their invaluable support in organising the camp,” it said on Monday. 
“The fitness camp has been instrumental in enhancing the physical capabilities of Pakistan’s T20 players, ensuring they are in optimal condition for forthcoming cricketing assignments which also includes ICC T20 World Cup in June this year. 
“Chairman also took the opportunity to interact with the players, personally commending them for their dedication and active participation in the camp. He expressed satisfaction over the players’ enthusiasm and commitment towards enhancing their fitness levels. 
“In addition to meeting with the players, Chairman PCB also held a meeting with the selection committee to talk about the team’s selection ahead of the New Zealand T20I series. The meeting was also attended by captain Babar Azam. Chairman PCB also took the members into confidence on the developments made by the Board regarding the appointment of head coach.” 
Naqvi, meanwhile, was thankful to the Pakistan Army for their support.  
“Their collaboration will not only enhance the fitness levels of our players but will also make them more disciplined in future,” he was quoted as saying. 
“This camp will surely put the players in good stead before undertaking a challenging journey leading to a global tournament in the USA and West Indies. 
“The PCB remains dedicated to providing comprehensive support to its players, equipping them with the necessary tools and resources to excel at the international level.” 
Well-placed sources, however, told Dawn that while everything seems normal at the surface, the abrupt changing of the captain could impact dressing-room harmony. 
“It would have been better had the PCB taken Shaheen into the confidence over its decision,” they said. “Shaheen preferred to keep silent as he has a vast career ahead of him and any severe reaction could have created problems for him. There are also some fitness problems that he’s dealing with at the moment.” 
BABAR’S DEMAND 
Dawn has also learnt that Babar’s demand of a confirmed two-year stint as captain was rebuffed by the PCB. 
“For now, nothing has been fixed,” sources said. “Babar is captain until the World Cup in June and depending on his performance as captain, it will be decided whether the PCB will move forward with him or not.” 
Babar resigned as Pakistan’s all-format captain after the team’s disastrous showing at the ODI World Cup in India last year. That had also led to the entire team management being asked to go by then-interim PCB chief Zaka Ashraf. 
Zaka, it emerged, wanted to break a stranglehold that Saya Corporation, a players’ agency based in England, had over the team with previous chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq also having a role in the company. 
“Zaka had a report that 44 players in Pakistan were the members of the Saya corporation and both Babar and Inzamam were on one-page to pick or drop a player, mainly taking interest of the corporation,” sources said told Dawn. 
“Zaka had formalised a framework to ensure that one agency couldn’t represent more than three to four players but it the new PCB leadership doesn’t plan to imp­ose any such binding on the players.”

9,Bologna beat Salernitana to continue CL charge,Bologna currently sit in the final spot but Serie A is firmly in the running for an extra place in next year’s revamped tournament.,"MILAN: Bologna cruised past Serie A’s bottom side Salernitana 3-0 on Monday to continue their charge towards a first-ever appearance in the Champions League.
Stunning first-half strikes from Riccardo Orsolini and Alexis Saelemaekers and Charalampos Lykogiannis’ fine finish in stoppage time ensured that Bologna would stay in fourth place, five points above Roma who were held to a goalless draw at Lecce.
Thiago Motta’s side have won eight of their last nine matches and not only look a good bet to reach Europe’s top club competition, but also have Juventus in their sights.
Juve are just two points ahead of Bologna following their last-gasp defeat at Lazio on Saturday and have been dragged back into a battle for the Champions League.
Bologna currently sit in the final spot but Serie A is firmly in the running for an extra place in next year’s revamped tournament, meaning fifth may well be good enough.
Both Bologna and Roma host Juve before the end of the season.
“We’re doing really well at the minute, with the way that we’re playing and the results we’re getting,” said Motta to Sky Sport.
Although the seven-time Italian champions played one round in the old European Cup in 1964, the same year that they most recently won the Scudetto, they have never participated in the modern Champions League.
Last season’s ninth place was the highest Bologna had finished in Serie A for over a decade and they are well on course for their best placing in years.
“Obviously we’re looking at the table but that’s not what matters to us, what’s important is putting in the work in training and the performances on the pitch,” said Saelemaekers.
Stefano Colantuono could not turn around Salernitana’s fortunes in his first match in charge, his team falling to their third straight defeat as they sink towards Serie B.
