3,AJK condemns Indian media’s link of fast-food chain attack with ‘extremism’,Home dept says preliminary investigations had revealed that the untoward incident had nothing to do with religious or any other kind of extremism.,"MUZAFFARABAD: Amid calls by the business community and religious leaders for a transparent judicial inquiry and exemplary punishment to the perpetrators of a recent attack on an international fast food franchise in Mirpur, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government on Monday condemned the Indian media’s ‘desperate’ attempts to link the incident with ‘extremism.’
In a statement, a spokesman for the AJK home department asserted that the preliminary investigations had revealed that the untoward incident had nothing to do with religious or any other kind of extremism.
“However, until the completion of the prejudice-free investigation process, the authorities concerned have withheld most of the information obtained from the detainees and other sources,” he said.
He regretted that the Indian media has always been habitual of making a mountain out of a molehill in its desperate bids to defame Pakistan and AJK.
“Non-violence, tolerance, and coexistence are the hallmarks of the liberated territory’s peaceful and pluralist society, but India’s ill-informed propagandist media is exploiting and blowing this particular issue out of proportion to serve the interests of the fanatic Modi government.”
“By launching a vicious propaganda campaign about Azad Kashmir, India actually wants to deflect world attention away from the terror it has unleashed in occupied Kashmir,” the spokesman said.
He informed that police had launched a crackdown on the suspects soon after the registration of the FIR, and so far, 60 of them have been apprehended.
Franchise owner Chaudhry Mohammad Saeed, who is also a former minister and local PML-N leader, also dismissed propaganda by the Indian media, asserting that the incident appeared to be an outcome of either some “sort of misunderstanding or rivalry.”
“Our franchise was providing livelihood to over 100 locals, apart from paying a good amount of revenues to the local tax authorities… Some miscreants agitated and misinterpreted the whole issue, as a result of which the gullible demonstrators went out of control,” he said.
Condemning the incident at a press conference, religious scholars from different schools of thought demanded a judicial inquiry to expose elements involved in it covertly or overtly.
“This incident is a result of the negligence of our administration, which did not take us into confidence about the [identity of the] people who they had allowed to stage a protest,” said Mufti Wasim Raza, chairman of the AJK Ulema and Mashaikh Council, at the press conference along with some other colleagues.
Interestingly, the press conference was held in the presence of Mirpur’s additional commissioner, Chaudhry Sajid Aslam. He said neither Islam nor the law of the land allowed a protest where one should damage the properties of his own country.
“Religious scholars are responsible members of society, and they have not allowed the use of their mosques and pulpits for extremism. After a transparent inquiry, the authorities should take strict action against the accused so that such miscreants could not dare damage any property under the garb of religion or extremism,” he said.
Meanwhile, the executive committee and senior members of the AJK Chamber of Commerce and Industries on Monday also urged the government to interrogate and award exemplary punishment to the perpetrators so that no one could dare resort to such an act in the future.

4,"DIG suspends seven SHOs, dismisses two others after exit of police chief",Officers say former IGP had clipped powers of DIG to transfer and suspend officials last year,"ISLAMABAD: Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Islamabad Syed Shahzad Nadeem Bukhari on Monday dismissed two station house officers (SHOs) and suspended seven others, police said.
Former IGP Akbar Nasir Khan had appointed all the 28 station house officers in the capital. As soon as Mr Khan was posted out, the DIG all of a sudden suspended seven SHOs and dismissed two others.
The police said the SHOs of Aabpara and Sihala were dismissed from service while the SHOs of Margalla, Ramna, Sangjani, Nilore, Koral, Loi Bher and Humak were suspended.
Police officers told Dawn that the DIG and the IGP had developed severe differences and after the removal of the former the DIG vented out his anger on his subordinates by dismissing and suspending them even though such powers had been taken from him in September 2023.

Officers say former IGP had clipped powers of DIG to transfer and suspend officials last year

The differences between the two officers had developed over transfer/posting of officials. The police chief had barred DIG Bukhari from reshuffling in the operations division and asked him to act only as a supervisory officer. 
The DIG had appointed seven SHOs in August 2023 by removing those appointed by the IGP when he had left the country for England after the end of the PDM government.
Upon his return, he found the seven SHOs appointed by him transferred. Over the issue, the IGP showed his displeasure and brought back all the SHOs.
Over the issue, the IGP also issued a standing order and clarified the roles of the operations division. 
The order stated that Islamabad was one district and the role of Islamabad capital city police officer (ICCPO) - IGP - had been defined in Police Order 2002 which was in vogue in the capital.
According to Article 10, 11 and 27 of the Police Order 2002, administration of police in a general police area vested with the ICCPO, it said. Moreover, ICCPO shall exercise such powers and perform such functions and duties and shall have such responsibility as may be provided by or under the Police Order 2002 and any other law from the time being force.
The CPO (DIG) operations is a supervisory officer to monitor the performance of these specialised branches of the operations and investigation and report to ICCPO in all relevant matters, the order said, adding the SSP operations shall exercise power of the district police officer for operational purposes.
The SSP operations and the SSP investigation shall notify posting of officer in-charge police station(s) and in-charges of investigations, units and teams, where applicable, it said. In case of any disagreement, the directions of the ICCPO will be solicited.
As such, powers were taken from DIG Bukhari through the office order and SOP issued by the IGP. The same could only be restored through an office order and the SOP issue by the police chief.
Under the standing order and SOP, the DIG has no power to suspend and dismiss any SHO as the standing order and the SOP have yet to be suspended, the officers added.
A message was also sent out through the police communication system on Monday, stating that all inspectors and sub-inspectors willing for appointment as SHOs should appear at the office of DIG at 3pm for test and interview.
When contacted, a spokesman for the police confirmed that last year the then IGP had suspended the power of the DIG to appoint, suspend and dismiss SHOs.

7,US president’s pledge on health an outcome of global summit: ex-minister,Says first ever health security summit organised in Pakistan early this year has started bearing fruit.,"ISLAMABAD: The first ever global health security summit (GHSS) held in Pakistan early this year has started bearing fruit as US President Joe Biden in his letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif put the health security on top of priorities to get US support.
This was stated by former caretaker health minister Dr Nadeem Jan, who organised the GHSS in Islamabad in January this year. The summit was attended by delegates from 70 countries. Before the summit, Dr Jan had stated that it would be a game changer for the health sector of Pakistan and the entire globe.
Talking to Dawn on Monday, Dr Jan said he was clear in his plea that the summit would be a climate COP-like event which would push the world for equitable pandemic preparedness and response.
“In my concluding speech, I had mentioned that we had set the stage for taking global health security to its due space in global development agenda. I am quite happy that President Biden has put the issue on top of the priorities,” he said.

Says first ever health security summit organised in Pakistan early this year has started bearing fruit

President Biden, in a letter written to Prime Minister Sharif last week assured him that the US will continue standing with Pakistan to tackle the most pressing global and regional challenges.
“That includes advancing our shared vision for a future of greater health security, economic growth and access to education for all. Through our U.S.-Pakistan ‘Green Alliance’ framework, we will also continue to strengthen our climate resilience, support sustainable agriculture and water management and assist with Pakistan’s recovery from the devastating floods in 2022. And, the United States remains committed to working with Pakistan to protect human rights and promote progress,” the president stated.
Replying to a question, Dr Jan said the prophecy was being witnessed unfolding to reality as a momentum for equitable pandemic response has been geared up and several health think-tanks have started serious efforts towards that aim.
“It is the first time that a head of state is mentioning global health security as priority area for cooperation. Moreover, the US government has also planned for a big grant to Pakistan in the area of health security and process has been initiated into that effect,” he said.
Replying to a question, the former health minister said some other countries like UK, China and EU also had current or future programmes to support Pakistan’s global health security agenda.
“The onerous is in the new government how it capitalises on this and takes the maximum out of this for Pakistan’s health sector. The GHS momentum, an amalgam of 70 countries, can be utilised by Pakistan for other health and climate gains and can be used to advocate for our climate justice narrative,” he said.
“It’s imperative that the new government steer the GHS leadership and formalise the ‘Islamabad Pandemic Accord’ with member states reached at the summit. Sustaining this high level global policy space requires enlightened leadership and serious commitment from political and military leadership,” he said.
The two-day summit organised under the theme “Together for a healthy planet” aimed to foster international cooperation, knowledge exchange and strategic partnerships to enhance global health security.

10,IGP post still vacant as new chief reluctant to take charge,"“The officers of the Police Services of Pakistan consider it disrespectful to salute their juniors,” sources say.","ISLAMABAD: The office of the Islamabad police chief has been lying vacant for the past three days since the transfer of Akbar Nasir Khan who relinquished his charge last week without the nomination of an officer – by the outgoing IGP or the chief commissioner – to look after the top office till the arrival of the new inspector general police (IGP).
On Friday, the Establishment Division named DIG Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, a grade 20 officer, for the coveted post and transferred Akbar Nasir with immediate effect. Subsequently, a ceremony was arranged for the outgoing police chief as well as the newly-appointed IGP at the Central Police Office, Islamabad, on Saturday afternoon. Akbar Nasir attended the ceremony while his proposed successor chose to skip it.
Due to a delay in the arrival of the new chief, the capital police are without its head. The outgoing IGP and the chief commissioner respectively did not nominate any officer as the acting police chief under the Police Rules until DIG Rizvi could resume the charge.
Though Dr Akbar Nasir was removed from the post on Friday, he still approved the five-day leave requested by at least three DIGs – DIG Security Owais Ahmed, DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza, and Safe City Authority Director General Mohammad Shoaib. The same DIGs also approached the chief commissioner for a 15-day leave on Monday.

Three DIGs approach commissioner’s office for 15-day leave

Five days is the maximum period of leave which can be approved by the IGP under the Police Rules. Sources said the three officers wanted to go on leave because they were senior to DIG Rizvi and they did not want to serve under the junior officer.
“The newly appointed police chief and the three DIGs are grade-20 officers (DIGs); however, DIG Raza and DIG Owais are from CTP-29 course, DIG Shoaib from CTP-30 course, and DIG Rizvi is from CTP-31,” sources said.
“The officers of the Police Services of Pakistan consider it disrespectful to salute their juniors,” the sources said, adding that the DIGs took the leave to skip the welcoming ceremony wherein they were bound to salute the newly appointed IGP without any regard for the seniority.
Insiders said the DIGs in the absence of the police chief approached the commissioner’s office on Monday to seek two-week leave. They said the aforementioned DIGs would attempt to transfer from the Islamabad police if DIG Rizvi assumed the charge. “In case their transfer request does not go through, they will appear before the new IGP without wearing their official caps as under a clause of the rules, an officer without a cap will not salute their seniors,” they added.
According to sources, DIG Raza had planned to go to the Pakistan Railway Police a few months ago that he could tend to his ill mother, but after she died the officer remained in the capital police.
Akbar Nasir Khan is also a grade-20 (DIG) officer, the officers said, adding that the post of the IGP Islamabad was upgraded to grade-21 officer a few years ago. For the past few years, the Islamabad IGP has been a grade-20 officer; though the post officially belongs to a grade-21 officer. Earlier, the prime minister used to nominate the Islamabad IGP, but since 2011, the interior minister has been doing the job.
On Friday, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi accompanied with DIG Syed Nasir Rizvi met the premier and later a notification of his appointment as the IGP was issued.
The officers said that DIG Rizvi was appointed on the recommendation of the interior minister and wanted to bring his team of officers to the capital police but the quarters concerned expressed displeasure over this move. At this, DIG Rizvi ‘convinced’ the high-ups in the Punjab police to retain him.
The police spokesperson confirmed that the newly appointed IGP had yet to assume the charge and that the three DIGs had approached the chief commissioner’s office for leave. The spokesperson also confirmed the post of the IGP was vacant and there was no stopgap arrangement in place. About other issues mentioned in this report, he did not comment or express ignorance.
During the tenure of the Safe City DG Shoaib, three cameras of the Safe City installed near the Margalla police station and a kilometre away from Korla police station were stolen in September 2023 and March 2024, respectively. Besides, transformers installed beside the safe city cameras and valuables from a car parked in front of the safe city cameras were also stolen.
During the tenure of Hassan Raza as the DIG Security, thieves stole communication cables of police offices in the Diplomatic Enclave in March 2023, the officers said, adding that the PTC cables were also stolen from the heavily guarded ‘Red Zone’ in March this year during the stint of Owais Ahmed as the DIG Security.

The IHC division bench, comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, granted bail to Fawad Chaudhry.
The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had alleged that Chaudhry “extended unlawful political influence and prepared an incorrect feasibility report of the Jhelum-Pind Dadan Khan Dual Carriageway project by fabricating facts”.
The bureau accused him of receiving “illegal gratification from contractor”.
NAB further alleged that Fawad “approved a petrol pump along the dual carriageway road project for his personal interest” and misused authority and influence to help his relatives and others with the purchase of land along the dual carriageway.
The counsel for Fawad Chaudhry argued that the case was “politically motivated” and “brought just for political victimisation and to stop the petitioner from contesting the general elections”.
He argued that Fawad was a well-known politician and nothing was recovered during his physical remand.

12,Ministry slaps ban on deputation in CDA,Large number of officers from other departments posted in civic agency under stop-gap arrangements,"ISLAMABAD: The interior ministry has imposed a ban on further deputation in the Capital Development Authority (CDA) – a most sought after organisation for government officers.
According to a notification issued by the ministry, there will be a ban on further deputation in Islamabad.
“It has been observed with great concerns that this ministry has been receiving multiple requests for posting of the officers/officials from different organisations/departments in CDA on deputation basis. This practice of stop-gap arrangements is not in favour of an expedient administration,” read the interior ministry’s letter issued on March 25.
“In view of the above, the competent authority has directed to impose ban on deputation in CDA, except those cases falling under the government wedlock policy,” it went on to say.

Large number of officers from other departments posted in civic agency under stop-gap arrangements

A large number of officers had joined the CDA during the last over two decades on deputation and many of them preferred certain directorates of CDA – land directorate, estate wing, enforcement wing and municipal administration. Mega corruption scams in these directorates took place when deputationists headed them.
Similarly, the CDA, being a rich organisation, also provided facilities to deputation officers, including chauffer-driven cars and other perks and privileges, that attracted government officers to it.
“Here in the CDA, a grade 18 officer of the federal government enjoys control of the complete directorate, has an official car and a large number of subordinate staff, whereas in the ministry, even a deputy secretary of grade 19 has no such facility. These are the reasons the CDA is the most sought after place for deputation officers,” an official said.
On the other hand, CDA officials Dawn spoke to said taking deputation officer in the civic body’s strength against vacant posts was not illegal. They said the problem was that the number of seats in the CDA, which were supposed to be filled through direct recruitment, had been lying vacant for long. The officials said to discourage the deputation officers, there was a need to fill these posts through a competitive process.
Currently, the directorates of land, estate, enforcement and municipal administration were being headed by deputation officers whereas several others were holding the position of directors general and deputy directors general in various departments of the CDA.
“Nowadays, we have around 20 officials on deputation. But they had joined the authority after following legal procedure against vacant posts,” another CDA official said.
The CDA is governed through a board which consists of a chairman and various members. Of the more than 120 members that have served in the CDA since the agency’s inception, hardly 20 were regular CDA employees. It is said that only one regular CDA officer, Shafi Sehwani, has ever become the chairman of the civic agency in all these years.
Officials said there was a need to make recruitments against posts that were supposed to be filled either through direct recruitment or deputation.
They said there was also a need to improve the capacity of CDA’s own officials to dispose of works in time. Some officials were known for their incompetency and to hide this, they used delaying tactics in resolving even trivial matters, they added.

13,‘Cosmetic’ steps fail to check rising prices of food items,Consumers in Taxila and Wah say special magistrates and price control committees have given free hand to profiteers,"TAXILA: The cosmetic steps taken by the local administration like snap visits, imposing fines on violators of official price lists and arresting shopkeepers for profiteering have proved eyewash as consumers are still faced with artificial price hike in Taxila and nearby areas. 
The local administration and price control committees have failed to control prices as shopkeepers and vendors are fixing the rates on their own violating the official price lists. 
Retailers claimed that short supplies and high prices in the wholesale market were behind the price hike. Meanwhile, government initiatives have failed to make a meaningful difference on local markets.
Public circles, especially daily wagers and salaried class, complained that prices of essential commodities had gone up significantly in Wah Cantt and Taxila, but special price magistrates and price control committees did not act.

Consumers in Taxila and Wah say special magistrates and price control committees have given free hand to profiteers

A visit to various bazaars and markets in the city showed rampant exploitation of consumers by hoarders and profiteers with the government machinery turning a blind eye to the situation.
Grocery, dairy, meat, bread, vegetable and fruit sellers rejected the prices set by the assistant commissioner, calling the official prices a joke.
Shopkeepers in Faisal Shaheed Road, Railway Road, Museum Road, Zafar Ali Khan Road, Nawababad, Muneerabad, Model Town, Fatima Town, New City, Malikabad, Asifabad, Lalazar, Lalarukh, Gadwal and HMC Colony are openly selling items like pulses, rice, gram, milk, gram flour, meat and bread at open market rates defying the official rate list issued by the local administration.
Jameel Ahmed, a shopper at Taxila Chowk, said wholesalers and retailers particularly of fruit and vegetable dealers were enjoying free hand and fleecing customers during the holy month despite the tall claims made by the authorities concerned. 
Zubaida Parveen, a housewife, while talking to this reporter on Railway Road, said the government, including Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz can be seen on social media and even on TV channels making tall claims of taking action against profiteers and hoarders but in reality nobody from the government was seen in the field.
Nisa Javaid was of the view that vegetable prices had skyrocketed and people were unable to purchase them.  A comparison of both rates showed that the official price of white chickpeas was Rs325 per kg but it was being sold at Rs450 per kg in the open market.
Similarly, the assistant commissioner Taxila had fixed the rate of black chickpea at Rs240 per kg but in the open market it was Rs350 per kg, basin (AC rate Rs245, open market Rs320 per kg), red lentil (AC rate Rs245, open market Rs330 per kg), groundnut pulse (AC Rs290, open market Rs340 per kg), red lentil (AC rate Rs310, open market Rs360 per kg), basmati good quality rice (AC rate Rs300, open market rate Rs400 per kg), eri tota rice (AC rate Rs155, open market Rs200 per kg), open milk (AC rate Rs170, open market Rs200 per litre), yoghurt (AC rate Rs200, open market Rs220 per kg), mutton (AC rate Rs1,600 per kg, open market Rs2,200 per kg) and beef (rate fixed by the AC Rs800 against open market rate of Rs1,200 per kg).
Residents have expressed dismay over the escalating prices of essential commodities like milk, yoghurt and mutton, attributing the situation to the failure of the local administration to regulate prices and prevent artificial shortage.
When contacted, a spokesman for the local administration said price control magistrates were regularly making snap visits to markets and bazaars in Taxila and imposing fines on violators of official price list. He added that shopkeepers involved in profiteering were being arrested and FIRs were also lodged against them.
