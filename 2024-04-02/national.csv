0,‘PTI-SIC’ moves SC against denial of reserved seats,KP Assembly speaker challenges PHC order to administer oath to MPAs-elect.,"ISLAMABAD: The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the new home for PTI lawmakers-elect — on Monday filed a petition in the Supreme Court, challenging the Peshawar High Court (PHC) order that deprived the party of seats reserved for women and minorities.
Meanwhile, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly speaker has also approached the PHC against its division bench’s directive for him to administer oath to MPAs notified on reserved seats.
Moved by SIC Chairman Sahibzada Mohammad Hamid Raza through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui, the petition before the Supreme Court seeks the setting aside of the PHC judgement of March 14.
The SIC was earlier joined by PTI-backed independent candidates after they won the Feb 8 elections, since Imran Khan’s party had been deprived of its electoral symbol ‘bat’.
Earlier, in a four-one verdict, the ECP had ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats which is a requirement of the law.

KP Assembly speaker challenges PHC order to administer oath to MPAs-elect

The SIC apprised the SC that the PHC verdict was based on a fundamental misconception and misinterpretation of Articles 51 and 106. The interpretation of both articles in letter and spirit suggests the concept of a proportionate representation system based on a “total number of general seats secured by each political party from the province concerned in the National Assembly” or “total number of general seats secured by each political party in a provincial assembly”, it argued.
“In other words, the fact whether the political party, which now has general seats in the assemblies, had fought the election or not, is not a constitutional requirement for the allocation of reserved seats under proportional representation system,” the petition emphasised.
Besides, it added, the high court’s judgement was based on a fundamental misconception and misinterpretation of the Elections Act 2017.
It argued that neither SIC nor PTI was legally required to submit its list of candidates for reserved seats before the election, as neither SIC nor PTI contested the general election of 2024 under the election symbol rather its electoral candidates contested the said general election as independent candidates. “In other words, the requirement to submit lists for reserved seats prior to the general election only applies to the political parties which contest such election, and not to those which become parliamentary parties/political parties in the national and provincial assemblies as a result of the joining of independent candidates declared successful in elections,” it argued.
Oath-taking order challenged
KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati on Monday filed a review petition in PHC against the division bench’s verdict asking him to administer the oath to the MPAs elected on reserved seats.
On March 27, the PHC division bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Shakeel Ahmad had accepted three identical petitions filed by opposition MPAs elected on reserved seats, and directed the speaker to include the matter as agenda item No. 1 of the first business day of the session requisitioned for the Senate elections.
Mr Swati in the petition filed through Advocate Ali Azeem Afridi requested the PHC to review the March 27 judgement because it did not take hold of the factual position insofar session requisitioned; to say nothing of facilitation of respondent(s) casting their votes in the upcoming Senate elections.
It asserted the speaker could only convene a session of the assembly upon requisition from the government or opposition.
The petition stated that the speaker’s office holds no information, as to summoning of or session requisitioned for the upcoming Senate elections by the government, let alone inclusion of the matter in question as agenda item No. 1 of the first business day of the session requisitioned and facilitation of respondent(s).
Meanwhile, a PHC division bench took up a petition filed by PTI leader Azam Khan Swati against the ECP about the possible postponement of the Senate polls in KP. The bench decided to club his petition with the review plea of the KP Assembly speaker and adjourned the hearing to Tuesday (today).

1,Six judges deserve salute for showing courage: Alvi,Regrets that personal discussions and life of the judges were recorded and filmed in the country.,"LAHORE: Former president Dr Arif Alvi on Monday said the six judges of the Islamabad High Court — who have accused the country’s intelligence apparatus of interference in judicial affairs — deserved a salute for showing courage.
Addressing a lawyers’ convention, he regretted that personal discussions and life of the judges were recorded and filmed in the country. He said the Constitution holds a great importance for him and even more than that, the law of Allah Almighty.
Mr Alvi emphasised that efforts should be made to establish a welfare state on the basis of Riasat-i-Madina, regretting that people used to mock such an idea. He said Pakistan has to be made the Pakistan of the Quaid-i-Azam. “Islam teaches justice and we should do justice.”
On the occasion, Senat­or-elect Hamid Khan said he saluted the judges of the IHC, assuring that the lawyers of the country stood by the latter.
He said justice cannot be prevailed without a judiciary free from all pressures, adding that judges of all high courts would have to show courage like those of Islamabad. “Are all judges not seeing the oppression?” he questioned.
Hamid Khan said the whole nation was looking towards them (the judges), adding that the chief justice of Pakistan should have asked who was putti­­ng pressure on the jud­ges. He said the chief justice shou­­ld avail the opportunity to stand with the judges.
Sunni Ittehad Council MNA Salman Akram Raja said: “The time has come we have to become a nation.” He cal­led for a transparent investigation into the judges’ letter.
Mr Raja said it was reg­r­ettable to say that the jud­g­­es were working under fear.
The participants of the convention also staged a protest rally at GPO Chowk in support of the judges who wrote the letter to the Supreme Judicial Council members.

2,Chaos in NA as opposition stopped from debating letter,Minister Tarar calls it a sub judice matter.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Monday witnessed a noisy protest by the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) members demanding a general debate on the issue of the letter written by six judges of Islamabad High Court (IHC) regarding their alleged surveillance by the country’s intelligence agencies and interference in the judicial matters as the treasury benches and speaker termed it a sub judice matter.
Carrying placards with slogans seeking the release of Imran Khan and justice for the judges, the PTI lawmakers assembled in front of the speaker’s dais and raised full-throated slogans when he tried to conduct some routine business, ignoring their call for the debate on the judges’ issue.
Speaking on a point of order, PTI leader Omar Ayub drew the attention of Speaker Ayaz Sadiq that the opposition members had submitted an adjournment motion to the NA Secretariat on the judges’ issue and asked him to allow a general debate on this matter, declaring that the agenda that had been issued by the secretariat “does not reflect the reality”.

Mr Khan said the judges’ letter had exposed “the role of agencies” and how they interfered in the cases against ex-premier Imran Khan.

Minister Tarar calls it a sub judice matter

Federal Minister for Information Attaullah Tarar, however, said that since Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa had already taken a suo motu notice and fixed the hearing, the matter had become sub judice and could not be debated in the assembly.
However, PTI’s chief whip Aamir Dogar said the country was facing a “constitutional crisis” after the judges’ letter and the parliament should discuss the matter considering the fact that the judiciary was an important pillar of the state.
Another senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser said since the issue was “sensitive” in nature, the speaker should use his powers under the rules and allow a debate on it. “The whole nation is facing a trauma because if there is no prestige left for the judges and if you will take decisions from the judges through dictation and by putting pressure on them and if cameras will be installed at their houses, then it is a sensitive matter,” said Mr Qaiser, asking the speaker to allow the debate.
Speaker Sadiq said that he would give his ruling on the matter keeping in mind the sensitivity of the issue. He said if the matter was sub judice, then they should better wait for an outcome of the case.
PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said that in the letter, the judges had mentioned that the “interference” in the judicial matters and political cases was still going on. He demanded that the lawmakers be allowed to debate the matter and suggest steps to prevent such ‘interference’. He also proposed that the house should pass a resolution against the ‘interference’.
The PTI members raised slogans of turncoat when Noor Alam Khan took the floor to criticise the PTI members for raising the judges’ issue, instead of discussing the ‘real public issues’ of price hike and power crisis.
Mr Khan, who had quit PTI and now represents the opposition JUI-F in the house, received the wrath of PTI members when he asked them “to think of the country, instead of thinking only about one person”.
Another firebrand PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat, however, expressed his concerns over the surge in terrorism and the killing of the foreign nationals, particularly the Chinese, demanding a debate on the issue of terrorism.
At the outset, the speaker administered oath to 10 newly-elected members, nine of them belonging to PML-N and one from the MQM.
The speaker then read out the prorogation order of the president to adjourn the session for an indefinite period.

4,PTI leader launches bid to form ‘grand opposition alliance’,Omar Ayub expected to be named NA opposition leader today.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) will host a meeting of opposition parties today (Tuesday) in a bid to form a ‘grand opposition alliance’ to launch a fre­sh country-wide protest campaign against the government, which was only formed a month ago.
PTI leader and former speaker National Assembly Asad Qaiser is hosting the meeting of opposition parties to form an alliance. How­e­ver, it is yet to be ascertained which of the opposition parties will take part.
A PTI source said that Mr Qaiser had contacted all parties intending to join the opposition alliance, including Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), and they all have assured him of their presence in the meeting.
He said that after the formation of the ‘grand alliance’, the PTI-led opposition would launch a countrywide protest campaign against the government, which the party believes came into power through “massive rigging”.

Omar Ayub expected to be named NA opposition leader today

Mr Qaiser is the head of a committee formed by PTI’s founding chairman Imran Khan to contact the leadership of other political parties after the Feb 8 general elections, and has previously met with the JUI-F leadership and others on several occasions.
Leader of the Opposition
Meanwhile, the National Assembly will likely see senior PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan being declared leader of the opposition.
“Under rule 39 (2) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly 2007, the count of the members voting for the opposition leader will be held on April 2 at 11 am,” said National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, while presiding over the NA session on Monday.

5,Govts dole out uplift funds to MNAs as development spending falters,Parliamentarians get 42.22pc of allocated funds in 8MFY24.,"ISLAMABAD: As development spending continued to falter in the first eight months of the current fiscal year, successive governments kept doling out funds for the discretionary schemes of parliamentarians, according to official data.
In the past eight months, parliamentarians consumed Rs38 billion out of the allocated Rs90bn in the budget for their schemes, as per the latest data on development expenditure released by the Planning Commission.
The development activities under all the other 34 federal ministries during the 8MFY (July-February) kept struggling with a combined expenditure of just Rs107bn.
The total expenditure under the entire Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) stood at Rs237bn in eight months, over Rs13bn less than Rs250.3bn in the same period last year.
This also included spending on corporations, special areas like Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and merged districts of
the formerly Federally Administered Tribal Areas.

Parliamentarians get 42.22pc of allocated funds in 8MFY24

In absolute terms, special areas, including Azad Kashmir, GB and merged tribal districts, received the most funding with Rs46.6bn in eight months, followed by Rs37.98bn for the parliamentarians’ scheme.
The funding for special areas was around 27.4 per cent of their budgetary allocation of Rs170bn. Meanwhile, MNAs schemes have already received 42.22pc of funds out of their allocated Rs90bn.
In October 2022, the then Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government increased the allocated amount for schemes — dubbed the Sustainable Development Goals Achievement Programme (SAP) — to 87bn, ensuring that all of the coalition’s then 174 members of National Assembly get Rs500m for implementing small projects like sewage lines, gas, water and electricity connections, and repair and maintenance of streets in their constituencies.
The same government subsequently enhanced the funds by Rs3bn to Rs90bn for the current fiscal year and authorised the release of Rs61bn before leaving office in the second week of August 2023.
By Aug 31, only Rs14.4bn had been utilised. The amount jumped to Rs22.9bn by the end of Q1 on Sep 30 and crossed Rs35bn by Dec-end, accounting for 39pc of the annual allocation.
In January 2024, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and the National Economic Council (NEC) decided to cap SAP funds at Rs61bn, which were already authorised for disbursement and save the remaining Rs30bn for deficit financing.
The mechanism
Under the disbursement mechanism announced by the Planning Division, the development funds allocated in the federal budget should be released at the rate of 20pc in the first quarter (July-September), followed by 30pc each in the second (October-December) and third quarters  (January-March).
The remaining 20pc is released in the last quarter (April-June) of the fiscal year.
Under this principle, at least 70pc or Rs120bn should have been released for development activities in special
areas by now.
But the actual consumption has been Rs46.6bn only.
Likewise, Rs658bn out of Rs940bn should have been spent on PSDP projects including dams, roads, and funds for health, education and other sectors. But the overall expenditure was Rs237bn, around Rs421bn short of estimated consumption till the end of 8MFY.
Excluding special areas and MNA schemes, only Rs152bn was spent on infrastructure and development.
The official data showed that excluding SAP, the actual development expenditure by three dozen ministries and divisions in eight months amounted to just Rs154bn against their annual allocation of Rs563bn.
Another Rs30.5bn was spent in the water sector against its annual allocation of Rs110.5bn.
Likewise, Rs44.7bn was spent by the National Highway Authority (NHA) and power companies against their total allocation of Rs212bn, even though substantial foreign exchange inflows had materialised in these two sectors.
The NHA used Rs25bn, or 16pc of its Rs156bn allocation, while power companies consumed Rs20bn, or about 36pc of their Rs55.3bn allocation.
Ironically, the Higher Education Commission could utilise only Rs14.5bn or 24pc of its Rs60bn allocation, while the Ministry of Housing and Works spent Rs8bn or about 20pc of its Rs41bn allocation.
Railways spent around Rs18.8bn against its annual allocation of Rs33bn.
The data showed that the government had authorised the release of Rs508bn till Jan 2024, while no additional amount was released in Feb.
This included Rs372bn for 36 ministries and divisions (including Rs61.3bn for MNAs) and Rs127bn for NHA and power companies.
This will be the third year in a row that the country’s under-funded infrastructure development will remain constrained by drastic cuts even in funds allocated by the parliament.
Last year, the development programme was marred by massive floods. The development projects, as a result, would face serious negative impacts of insufficient funding, thus affecting the standards of living of the people already suffering from record inflationary trends.

6,Protesting teachers in Quetta seek salaries,Set up camp outside the assembly gate to block the entry of individuals into the premises.,"QUETTA:  Hundreds of teachers, along with members of staff of the Balochistan University, staged a sit-in, in front of the Balochistan Assembly, on Monday.
After the sit-in, they marched on the main roads of the provincial capital against the non-payment of their salaries for the last four months, which they said had caused great financial difficulties.
They assembled within the univer­sity and took out a rally, which passed through the main Sariab Road, Jinnah Road and Zarghoon Road and finally reached the provincial assembly which was in session at the time.
The demonstrators carried placards and banners inscribed with their demands and chanted slogans in favour of their demands.They were led by Dr Kaleemullah and other leaders of the joint action committee.
They set up a camp, outside the assembly gate to block the entry of individuals into the premises. How­ever, people used alternative gates for entering the assembly.
Members of the assembly brought the protest to the notice of speaker retired  captain Abdul Khaliq Achakzai’s.
The speaker formed a five member committee, comprising Mir Saddiq Umrani, Mir Ali Madad Jattak, Rehmat Saleh Baloch, Agha Umar Ahmedzai and Wali Muhammad Nourzai to listen to the protestors demands.
The committee held negotiations with the joint action committee leaders, who informed them of their grievances and told them that university employees, including teaching staff, have not received salaries, which caused financial hardship.
The committee assured the joint action committee that issues relating to their salaries and pensions would be resolved, as soon as possible.
They said that Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti  has already approved a grant for universities to resolve financial crises.
Funds would be disbursed in coming days, the assembly members assured the teachers.
Following the assurances by the house committee, the joint action committee announced to end the protest.
However, they announc­­ed to resume the sit-in outside the main gate of the university, until the issue of delayed salaries was resolved once and for all.
