0,Over 800 scammers arrested in China-Myanmar joint operation,Beijing — a major ally and arms supplier of Myanmar’s isolated junta — has repeatedly asked the military to crack down on such operations.,"YANGON: More than 800 people suspected of being cross-border scammers were arrested in a joint police operation by Myanmar and China, Beijing’s embassy in Yangon said on Monday.
Scam compounds have flourished in Myanmar, staffed by citizens from China and other countries who are often forced to work swindling their compatriots in an industry analysts say is worth billions.
Beijing — a major ally and arms supplier of Myanmar’s isolated junta — has repeatedly asked the military to crack down on such operations.
Chinese law enforcement provided input to their Myanmar counterparts, who launched raids around Muse city, a major trade hub in northern Shan state, the embassy said on its WeChat channel.
Myanmar police arrested 807 people  “who committed cross-border crimes” and seized computers, mobile phones and  “fraud scripts”, it said in a statement.
Among those arrested were 352 Chinese citizens, who were transferred to China on Sunday, the statement said. The remainder were Myanmar nationals, it added.
The junta has not commented on the raids.
Last year, the United Nations human rights office said at least 120,000 people were being held in scam compounds in Myanmar.
Many were housed in the town of Laukkai in northeastern Shan state, which has since been captured by an alliance of ethnic minority armed groups. The alliance said it would wipe out the scam compounds.
More than 40,000 people suspected of taking part in cyber scams in Myanmar were handed over to China last year, according to Chinese state media.

1,"In April Fools’ joke, Trump says he is suspending campaign","“Trump hasn’t campaigned in 16 days. So not sure what the difference is,” said Biden campaign staffer.","WASHINGTON: Donald Trump sent a message to supporters on Monday that appeared to announce he was suspending his election campaign, but it turned out to be an April Fools fundraising bid.
The former Republican president, who is seeking to evict his Democrat rival Joe Biden from the White House in November’s vote, sent the abrupt message stating “I’m suspending my campaign” to supporters by email and text, accompanied by a link.
But clicking on it took users to a site inviting them to donate money to his campaign.
“Did you really think I’d suspend my campaign? Happy April Fools’ Day!” he wrote in capital letters.
The Biden team quickly clapped back with a jibe at Trump’s allegedly lazy schedule.
“Trump hasn’t campaigned in 16 days. So not sure what the difference is,” said Biden campaign staffer Ammar Moussa.
For years, US political candidates have courted small donors, inundating supporters with text messages, emails and phone calls — sometimes more than a dozen a day —  appealing for them to contribute financially to the cause. They can rake in millions of dollars by doing so, a key source of cash in a country where a presidential run can cost billions of dollars.

2,France urges China to send ‘clear message’ to Russia over Ukraine,"While China says it is a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict, it has been criticised for refusing to condemn Moscow for its offensive.","BEIJING: France’s top diplomat said on Monday that Paris wants China to send  “clear messages” to its strategic ally Russia over its war in Ukraine, after meetings with his counterpart in Beijing.
France and China have sought to strengthen ties in recent years and, during meetings in Paris in February, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told President Emmanuel Macron that Beijing appreciated his country’s  “independent” stance. But Paris has also sought to press Beijing on its ties with Moscow, which have only grown closer since the invasion of Ukraine.
While China says it is a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict, it has been criticised for refusing to condemn Moscow for its offensive. Paris has, in contrast, become one of Kyiv’s firmest backers, with Macron in February even refusing to rule out putting troops on the ground in Ukraine.
Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said that Beijing  “plays a key role in... the respect of international law, including on Ukraine’s sovereignty, and therefore we are clearly expecting that China will send very clear messages to Russia”.
“We are convinced that there will be no lasting peace if it is not negotiated with the Ukrainians,” he told a press conference in Beijing, speaking alongside his Chinese counterpart Wang. “There will be no security for Europeans if there is no peace in accordance with international law,” he continued.
“It is an essential issue for us, which is why France is determined to maintain a close dialogue with China,” he said.
‘Closeness’
Sejourne’s visit is the second to China by a French foreign minister in less than six months, following a trip by his predecessor Catherine Colonna in November. On Monday afternoon he met Premier Li Qiang at Beijing’s opulent Great Hall of the People, telling China’s number two official he wanted to discuss  “global situations that are fracturing and dividing the world today”.
“I am thinking of the situation in the Middle East, but also in Ukraine,” he said. Li said he was  “very happy” to welcome the minister to Beijing. “Our two countries have a long history and splendid civilisations,” Li said, hailing their shared  “spirit of independence and autonomy”.
“This explains why China and France have a natural sense of closeness,” he said.
Macron also visited last April, receiving a rock star welcome at a university in southern China from hundreds of screaming students and fans. But he faced accusations of cosying up to Beijing and sparked controversy by saying Europe shouldn’t be a  “follower” of the United States in the event of conflict with China over Taiwan.
His foreign minister’s visit this week comes as part of events marking the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between France and China. Sejourne will later in the day take part in the launch of the  “Versailles and the Forbidden City” exhibition, where around 60 works of art and valuables from the palace can be viewed by the public until the end of June.

3,Court extends Kejriwal’s detention,NEW DELHI: An Indian court renewed detention on Monday for key opposition leader Arvind Kejriwal until April 15 in a...,"NEW DELHI: An Indian court renewed detention on Monday for key opposition leader Arvind Kejriwal until April 15 in a graft case, his lawyers said, less than three weeks before voting begins in general elections.
In a move that sparked protests last month, India’s financial crime-fighting agency arrested Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi, over graft accusations related to the city’s liquor policy and he was remanded to custody until April 1.
Opposition parties say the arrest, along with government action against other opposition groups and their leaders, shows the government is denying them a level playing field in the elections, charges it denies.
Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) says he has been falsely arrested in a fabricated case, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) denies political interference.
Lawyers for the agency, the Enforcement Directorate, said that Kejriwal had been non-cooperative and gave evasive replies, asking the court to hold him in custody for 15 days longer, the website Live Law said.
“These people have only one aim, they want to put him in prison during the elections,” Kejriwal’s wife, Sunita, told reporters, referring to Modi’s government.  “The people will give a response to this dictatorship.”  BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said the court’s decision, based on concrete evidence, raised moral and constitutional questions.
The arrest of the high-profile leader set off protests in the capital and the northern state of Punjab, ruled by his party. The court’s decision comes a day after a New Delhi rally by the INDIA bloc, an alliance of 27 opposition parties including AAP, to protest against Kejriwal’s arrest, where they accused Modi of seeking to rig the elections.
Regional groups are among the opposition parties also facing action by federal agencies, which they have called politically motivated.

4,Human case of  avian influenza detected in Texas,CHICAGO: Texas and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday reported a human case of avian...,"CHICAGO: Texas and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday reported a human case of avian influenza in a person who had contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected with the virus.
It is the second case of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza identified in a person in the United States.
The CDC said this infection does not change the H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the general public, which it considers to be low.
The health agency said people who are exposed to infected birds or animals or to environment contaminated by them are at greater risk of infection.
The patient’s only symptom was eye inflammation, according to the state’s health department.
The CDC is working closely with state and federal agencies, including the United States Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and local health authorities to investigate and closely monitor this situation.

5,Diversity plans vanishing from US campuses amid culture wars,"Last June, the country’s conservative-majority Supreme Court put an end to affirmative action in university admissions.","WASHINGTON: The latest battle in the culture wars cleaving American society centers around diversity programmes on university campuses, now restricted or banned in a growing number of US states.
The debate pits those on the left, who advocate for boosting minority students victimised by deep-rooted inequality, and those on the right who say people should be judged on individual merit, not skin colour.
“The idea of present discrimination being the remedy for past discrimination... is inherently wrong,” said Jordan Pace, a Republican member of the House of Representatives in the state of South Carolina.
“We don’t like the idea of judging people based on immutable characteristics, whether it be gender or race or height or whatever,” he said, calling the United States a  “hyper-meritocratic society.” Often known as  “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) programmes, many American universities had given special consideration to minority students — particularly those who are Black, Hispanic and Native American — as they sought to correct long-standing inequalities.
Last June, the country’s conservative-majority Supreme Court put an end to affirmative action in university admissions, reversing one of the major gains of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.
Now, Pace is urging his state to follow the lead of Florida and about a dozen other states that have scrapped campus DEI programmes.
‘Get rid of us’
“The primary target group across the country... are Black people,” said Ricky Jones, professor of pan-African studies at the University of Louisville in Kentucky.
Carlie Reeves, 19, was the first person in her family to attend college and when she arrived at the University of Louisville, it was  “very obvious that my professors didn’t really think I belonged. Didn’t really see me as intelligent.” DEI leaders on campus  “spoke life into me and told me... you have the merit.” Many minority students are at the school  “100 per cent because of DEI,” she said, raising as an example Black students who benefitted from race-based scholarships.
But on March 15, Kentucky lawmakers advanced a proposal to restrict such programmes, spurring Reeves to co-organise a protest on campus.
“It just felt like my duty to inform the students, ‘Hey y’all, these people are trying to literally get rid of us from campus... we have to do something,” she said.
Kentucky is following other conservative states, including Texas, Alabama and Idaho. At the beginning of March, the University of Florida ended DEI programmes and related jobs, part of Republican Governor Ron DeSantis’s offensive against what he calls  “woke ideology.” 
‘Very dangerous forgetting’ 
“I’m extremely worried,” said Stephanie Anne Shelton, a professor and director of diversity at University of Alabama’s College of Education. While provisions in the state’s new law allow her to teach certain diversity awareness courses to future educators, she is concerned about  “the degree to which concepts like academic freedom remain in place.” 
In Alabama it is now prohibited to  “compel a student... to personally affirm, adopt, or adhere to a divisive concept” — specifying that includes making an individual feel the need  “to apologise on the basis of his or her race.” Failure to comply can result in dismissal, the law notes.

6,Emiratis battle to preserve dying art of embroidery,"AL AIN: Far from Dubai’s glitzy towers, Mariam al-Kalbani’s henna-dyed fingers weave brightly coloured threads ...","AL AIN: Far from Dubai’s glitzy towers, Mariam al-Kalbani’s henna-dyed fingers weave brightly coloured threads in a skill she hopes young Emirati women watching her can preserve for the future.
The art of hand-weaving braided shiny ribbons to adorn traditional clothing and bags is called Al Talli, and is on Unesco’s Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list. But with the relentless pace of change in the United Arab Emirates, its days may be numbered.
“It’s a craft of our ancestors and our people,” Kalbani said in Al Ain, the UAE’s fourth largest city, which sits between mountains and the desert. “If we do not take initiative and introduce it to them, it will disappear.” 
The 70-year-old craftswoman, wearing a traditional black abaya robe and golden face covering, has been training students and apprentices in the art for 15 years. “The goal is to revive the heritage for the next generation,” she said.
She emphasised that mastering Al Talli doesn’t happen  “in a couple of hours — it could take a year or two, especially if training is done just once a week”. Kalbani has been weaving Al Talli since she was a teenager. The simplest Al Talli designs are made from sixthreads — although they can number up to 50 — and mastering the process of combining them with beads, ornaments and precious metals such as gold can take a long time.
Accounting student Reem al-Ketbi watched Kalbani intently as she worked on a round cushion called a Mousadah, weaving a silver thread back and forth during a recent handicrafts festival.

7,Landmine blast kills nine children  in Afghanistan,"Swathes of Afghanistan are littered with unexploded mines, grenades and mortars from decades of conflict.","KABUL: Nine children were killed in a landmine blast in Afghanistan on Monday.
A provincial official believed the landmine was laid during the country’s decades of conflict.
Swathes of Afghanistan are littered with unexploded mines, grenades and mortars from decades of conflict, spanning from the Soviet invasion in 1979, the civil war that followed, and the 20-year Taliban insurgency against foreign-backed governments.
The provincial head of the information and culture department, Hamidullah Nisar, said the mine went off as a group of children were playing with it in the Geru district of Ghazni province on Sunday.
“An unexploded mine left over from the time of the Russian invasion went off when they were playing with it,” Nisar told AFP. “Unfortunately, it killed nine children.” Ghazni police said the children — five girls and four boys — were aged from four to ten years old.
Also on Sunday, another child died and five other people were wounded when unexploded ordnance went off in Herat province, local police said on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.
While violence has reduced dramatically since the Taliban seized power in August 2021, ending their insurgency, unexploded ordnance and mines, however, still claim lives regularly, with the International Committee of the Red Cross saying children are the main victims.

8,US senator demands ‘real action’ against Netanyahu,"Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Biden “needs to back up his ‘no excuses’ language with real action”.","WASHINGTON: A Democratic senator has urged US President Joe Biden to take “real action” against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s continued refusal to comply with his requests to increase humanitarian efforts in Gaza.
Appearing on ABC News’ “This Week” on Sunday, Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Biden “needs to back up his ‘no excuses’ language with real action.”
The senator has also urged the Biden administration to reconsider sending offensive weapons to Israel because of Israeli actions against civilians in Gaza and its expected invasion of Rafah.
“My view is until the Netanyahu government allows more assistance into Gaza, to help people who are literally starving to death, we should not be sending more bombs,” Van Hollen said.
Asked what additional steps he’d like to see from the administration, given Netanyahu’s resolve to invade Rafah, Van Hollen said there needs to be a “two-way street, not a one-way blank check with American taxpayer dollars.”
“I think we need to better utilise our leverage. We have different parts of leverage and one of them is sending more offensive weapons.” President Biden, he said, “needs to be as serious about ensuring more humanitarian assistance gets into Gaza as Netanyahu has been in making his demands.”
Asked if he considers Netanyahu a war criminal, Van Hollen said: “We’re going to have to make a decision as to what the intent of the full Israel government is … ultimately, that will have to be decided down the road,” he said.

9,Palestinians seek April vote for full UN membership,Global pressure has grown for resumption of efforts to broker a two-state solution.,"UNITED NATIONS: The Palestinian Authority wants the United Nations Security Council to vote this month to make it a full member of the world body, the Palestinian UN envoy said on Monday, a move that can be blocked by Israel’s ally the United States.
Riyad Mansour, who has permanent observer status in the UN, made the Palestinian plans public as the Israeli aggression nears a six-month milestone in Gaza and Tel Aviv is expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Mansour said that the aim was for the Security Council to take a decision at an April 18 ministerial meeting on the Middle East, but that a vote had yet to be scheduled. He said a 2011 Palestinian application for full membership was still pending because the 15-member council never took a formal decision.
“The intention is to put the application to a vote in the Security Council this month,” he added. Alongside a push to end the crisis, global pressure has grown for a resumption of efforts to broker a two-state solution — with an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.
UN approval
An application to become a full UN member needs to be approved by the Security Council — where the United States can cast a veto — and then at least two-thirds of the 193-member General Assembly.

Global pressure has grown for resumption of efforts to broker a two-state solution

The US mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A Security Council committee assessed the Palestinian application in 2011 for several weeks. But the committee did not reach a unanimous position and the council never voted on a resolution to recommend Palestinian membership.
At the time, diplomats said the Palestinians did not have enough support in the Security Council to force a veto by the United States, which had said it opposed the move. A resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the US, Russia, China, France or Britain to be adopted.
Instead of pushing for a council vote, the Palestinians went to the UN General Assembly seeking to become a non-member observer state. The assembly approved de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine in November 2012.
Little progress has been made on achieving Palestinian statehood since the signing of the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the early 1990s. Among the obstacles are expanding Israeli settlements.
The Palestinian Authority, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank and is Israel’s partner to the Oslo Accords. Hamas in 2007 ousted the Palestinian Authority from power in the Gaza Strip.
Israeli settlements risk eliminating any practical possibly of a Palestinian state, UN human rights chief Volker Turk said last month. He said the transfer by Israel of its own population into occupied territory amounted to a war crime.—Reuters
US President Joe Biden’s administration said in February that Israel’s expansion of West Bank settlements was inconsistent with international law, signaling a return to long-standing US policy on the issue that had been reversed by the previous administration of Donald Trump.

Police said that Sabah Abdel Salam Haniyeh, who is an Israeli citizen, was taken into custody in the town of Tel Sheva as part of an investigation also involving Israel’s security agency Shin Bet.
A police spokesman, who confirmed it was Haniyeh’s sister, said she is  “suspected of having contact with Hamas operatives and identifying with the organisation, while inciting and supporting acts of terrorism in Israel”.
Police said they found in the 57-year-old’s house  “documents, media, telephones, other findings and evidence linking her to the commission of serious security offences against the State of Israel”.
Ismail Haniyeh, who lives in Doha, is the head of Hamas’s political bureau.

11,Meta shuts monitoring tool in US election year,"The move, experts say, is in line with a tech industry trend of rolling back transparency and security measures","WASHINGTON: A digital tool considered vital in tracking viral falsehoods, CrowdTangle will be decommissioned by Facebook owner Meta in a major election year, a move researchers fear will disrupt efforts to detect an expected firehose of political misinformation.
The tech giant says CrowdTangle will be unavailable after August 14, less than three months bef­ore the US election. The Palo Alto company plans to rep­lace it with a new tool that researchers say lacks the sa­me functionality, and which news organisations will largely not have access to.
For years, CrowdTangle has been a game-changer, offering researchers and journalists crucial real-time transparency into the spread of conspiracy theories and hate speech on influential Meta-owned plat­forms, including Face­book and Instagram.
Killing off the monitoring tool, a move experts say is in line with a tech industry trend of rolling back transparency and security measures, is a major blow as dozens of countries hold elections this year — a period when bad actors typically spread false narratives more than ever.
“In a year where almost half of the global population is expected to vote in elections, cutting off access to CrowdTangle will severely limit independent oversight of harms,” Melanie Smith, director of research at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said.
“It represents a grave step backwards for social media platform transparency.” Meta is set to replace CrowdTangle with a new Content Library, a technology still under development. It’s a tool that some in the tech industry, including former Crowd­Tangle chief executive Brandon Silver­man, said is currently not an effective replacement, especially in elections likely to see a proliferation of AI-enabled falsehoods.
