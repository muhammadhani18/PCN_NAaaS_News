The mourners, including women, children and elder persons, marched towards Qadam Gah Maula Ali and reached there at around maghrib prayers to break the fast. All closed streets and thoroughfares were opened in the evening. 
Mourners brought out tabarukat – a replica of Hazrat Ali’s mausoleum – and zuljinah. They headed for Qadam Gah Maula Ali through Universal Chowk, Society Chowk and through the Lajpat Road area.

With the latest killing, the number of people murdered by street criminals in Karachi since the start of this year rises to 50.
The police said that Amjad Talib, 40, along with his friend, Amanullah, 40, drew cash from a bank within the remit of the SITE-Superhighway police station.
Area SHO Chaudhry Tufail said that they were heading home in a car when Talib sensed that they were being chased by suspected robbers on a motorbike.
He said that Talib was also carrying a licensed pistol and it seemed that the robbers opened indiscriminate fire the moment they saw him carrying the weapon and rode away without any loot.
Both the men suffered bullet wounds and were shifted to theAbbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors declared Talib dead on arrival. 
Talking to the media, victim’s grief-stricken brother Muzaffar urged the authorities that his brother died but “please save others’ lives”.
Talib was an estate agent in Taiser Town. He was father of two children and originally hailed from Khanewal.
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said he suffered a bullet wound in the neck. She said a post-mortem examination was carried out despite the fact that the family did not want to complete medico-legal formalities.
She added that wounded Amanullah also sustained a bullet wound in the neck.
Meanwhile, Sindh Home Minister Zia Lanjar ordered suspension of the SHO of the Gulshan-i-Maymar police station.

2,PPP withdraws man to support ‘independent’ Vawda for Senate,Sharjeel sees no harm in supporting ex-PTI leader.,"• Sharjeel sees no harm in supporting ex-PTI leader
• Three lawmakers take oath in PA session
• Polling for 12 Senate seats from Sindh today
KARACHI: A day before the polling for 12 Senate seats in the province, the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party on Monday withdrew one of its candidates and decided to support independent candidate Faisal Vawda on a general seat in the upper house election being held today.
Officials said that PPP candidate Sarfaraz Rajar submitted an application before the returning officer (RO) asking him to notify his retirement from the Senate polls. The RO accepted his plea and announced that he stood retired.

In total, 19 candidates are in the fray for the 12 seats after the withdrawal of the candidature of PPP’s Sarfraz Rajar.
Based on its numerical strength with 117 members in the house, the PPP is all set to bag a total of 10 seats — five general, two women, as many technocrat and one minority seats.
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan will easily get one seat with 37 MPAs in the house. The party had already announced that it would give its additional votes to Mr Vawda, whose candidature was proposed by party’s Ali Khurshidi and seconded by Adil Askari. Mr Vawda’s chances for win were bright after the PPP’s decision to withdraw Mr Rajar from the race.
Also, the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council members (PTI-backed independents) have decided against voting in the Senate elections, while three members of the Grand Democratic Alliance have still not taken oath.
‘Nothing wrong in supporting Vawda’

He said he was an independent candidate and not affiliated with any political party. “There is no issue if Faisal Vawda decides to become a senator,” he said.
He added that the former federal minister had earlier been affiliated with a political party, but now he was contesting the election as an independent candidate and not representing any specific party.
Two Muttahida, one PPP MPAs take oath

6,"Prices of khajla, pheni and pakora go beyond ordinary man’s reach","Jalebi selling at Rs940-1,400kg against official rate of Rs440-Rs400kg","KARACHI: Struggling hard to find various food items at the government notified rates, consumers face a sharp different between the prices fixed by the Karachi commissioner and the market rates of sweets, bakery and confectionary items in the metropolis, especially at big and famous shops, where the price difference is more than double.   
The commissioner has fixed prices of pakora, pheni, khajla, jalebi, etc, and categorised them in ‘A and B’ qualities.   
However, it is not clear whether these two categories are only for small and medium-sized manufacturers or do they apply to big confectioneries as well.   
On the other hand, many confectioneries do not follow the commissioner rates claiming that they are preparing these items in good quality ‘desi ghee’, which do not fall in this category, according to their claims.   
Given the situation, consumers find themselves at the losing end as no visible crackdown is being carried out on manufacturers of these items.   

Jalebi selling at Rs940-1,400kg against official rate of Rs440-Rs400kg  

Most consumers believe that officials do not hold any influence over these big manufacturers, thus consumers are at the mercy of these big businesses to pay hefty prices in the name of ‘brand and so-called quality’.   
Small and medium sized shopkeepers usually face the wrath of price checking officials, who impose fines of Rs8,000-15,000 for overcharging from official rates, a small sweet maker said.   
Price-conscious people throng small to medium-sized retail outlets for purchasing jalebi, samosas, pheni, pakora, khajla, etc, while people from upper class income groups, who are not bothered by high food inflation and utility bills, lift these items from big manufacturers’ outlets.  
The commissioner rates of pheni and khajla are fixed at Rs690 and Rs590 for A and B qualities.  
However, at branded shops these are available at Rs1,400-1620 per kg.  
The manufacturers claim that these items are prepared in Asli ghee at their shops.   
Those shopkeepers preparing these items in regular ghee or oil, are selling khajla and pehni at Rs800 per kg.  
The official prices of jalebi A and B qualities are fixed at Rs440 and Rs400 per kg.   
In contrast, shops offering jalebi in desi ghee are charging Rs940-1,400 per kg while non-desi ghee variety is available at Rs600-800 per kg.   
While the price regulator has mentioned in price lists A and B categories, it is silent on rates of products prepared in desi ghee, banaspati ghee and in regular cooking oil.   
“The price list of commissioner of Karachi has created confusion by separating two qualities [A and B] without mentioning its preparation in normal or desi oil or ghee. The letter ‘A’ does not mean that the items are prepared in desi ghee,” a sweet retailer said.   
In the commissioner’s list, pakora rates have been fixed at Rs560 and Rs480 per kg for A and B qualities, respectively, while at many big outlets, customers are being charged Rs660-800 for a kilo.   
Pakoras prepared in normal oil or ghee is selling at Rs600 per kg.   
The official rate of Aaloo (potato) samosa (A and B) varieties carrying a weight of 60 grams, is Rs33.  
Potato samosa ‘A’ quality carrying weight of 60 grams is sold at the control price of Rs30-Rs33 at big, medium and small sized shops.  
However, the small samosa at various shops create doubts that it may carry less than 50grams weight.  
Consumers are unable to find any Aaloo samosa at the price of Rs28 in the city.   
The price of Keema samosa (35 grams) is also fixed by the commissioner at Rs33 and Rs28 per piece for A and B varieties, which is selling in market at the rate of Rs50 and Rs60.

Some of the artworks displayed at the exhibition.—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

 
KARACHI: It is extremely important to understand and feel the spiritual link to our temporal lives, especially for the artist community because its members come from the sensitive segment of society. Seeking divine help and getting inspiration from those experiences and observations that enrich our souls is what sets us apart from the rest of the species. A two-person show titled Zikr, Volume III,which is underway at V M Art Gallery, explores those particular ‘dimensions the Islamic faith’.
The participating artists are Saba Qureshi and Alefiya Abbas Ali. As can be gauged from the rubric of the exhibition, it is part of a series called Zikr. Therefore, the two artists express their love for the divine with forms and shapes and subtle colour schemes that depict mystical subjects best illustrated through art. There are references to holy places as well which put the message across in a nice way because with them come geometrical patterns that symbolise such journeys. 
It is in this regard that reading the gallery’s statement on the show might suffice: “The design serves as a reminder of the two stages of the soul, analogous to the expansion and contraction of the chest, and seeks to evoke the ideal concept of existence being synonymous with compassion, despite its occasional distance. Together, their [Saba and Alefiya’s] combined artistic expressions weave a narrative of spiritual exploration and profound contemplation. They serve as a poignant call for compassion, unity, peace, love and faith during these challenging times, with a dedicated focus on expressing solidarity with the people of Palestine.”
Yes, there’s an exhibit by Saba called ‘Prayers for Palestine’ (pen on canvas) that focuses on the extremely important subject of the Middle East. 
Then, among other exhibits, Alefiya’s ‘Najm’ series (lead and handmade gouache—lamp black—and gold on arches paper) touches on the cosmic element of the spiritual world.
The show concludes on April 10.

8,Home minister slammed for dismissing street crime  as nothing unusual,KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami has questioned the “merit and competence” of Sindh home minister Ziaul Hassan ...,"KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami has questioned the “merit and competence” of Sindh home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar and accused him of “normalising” the growing number of street crimes in Karachi despite the fact that armed muggers had killed dozens of people in the city during the past few months.
This came after Mr Lanjar said during a presser that the law and order situation in Karachi was currently much better than what it used to be in the previous years, adding that a “hype” had been created over the issue of street crime in the city.
Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters Idara Noor-i-Haq on Monday, the JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman strongly criticised Mr Lanjar over what he called his “attempt to normalise” the growing number of crimes in the city and reiterated his demand to localise the police in the city.
“Only during this Ramazan, 10 innocent Karachiites lost their lives and became victims of street crimes,” he said and added: “the total death toll during the first three months of the year stood at 49 and you are calling it nothing unusual? Can any person with a heart comment like this? You call these numbers exaggerated by the media,” he said.
“Is killing of ten people in 20 days a usual thing for you, and that too when those people resisted muggers for saving their hard earned money? You [Mr Lanjar] have humiliated the people of Karachi and the families who are losing their loved ones, valuables and peace of mind every day,” he said.
“We demand the minister to take back his words and seek pardon from the people of Karachi,” said the JI chief.
Demanding police reforms, Hafiz Naeem urged the need to adopt community oriented policing model in order to address the issues of crimes in the city. He further said that purging the police department of black sheep and inclusion of local residents in the police were necessary to change the situation on the ground.
He held the Pakistan People Party government responsible for harbouring criminals in the Katcha area as well as in the urban areas of the province. He said the province had been handed over to criminals to an extent that the interprovincial highways were closed in the evening.

9,"After weeks, ECP notifies victory of JI’s Hafiz Naeem on PS-129",Officials say notification was issued after Hafiz Naeem and all JI candidates submitted their returns of election expenses;,"KARACHI: After an inordinate delay, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) notified the victory of Jamaat-i-Islami Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rahman on Monday from a provincial assembly constituency in the city.
Last week, the Sindh High Court had issued notices to the ECP and others on a petition filed by one of the aspirants from the constituency, seeking directive for the ECP to issue the notification about returned candidate from PS-129 (Karachi, Central-VIII).
The notification issued by the ECP said that in pursuance of Section 98(1) of the Election Act, 2017 the ECP hereby published the name of Naeem-ur-Rehman Khan as returned candidate from PS-129.
It further stated that Hafiz Naeem had secured highest votes i.e. 26,296, followed by Maaz Mukaddam of Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (20,608), PPP’s Asad Hanif (15,014) and PTI-backed independent Saif Bari secured 11,357 votes.

Officials say notification was issued after Hafiz Naeem and all JI candidates submitted their returns of election expenses; notification to enable PTI-backed candidate to challenge result before tribunal  

According to Section 98 (1) of the Election Act 2017, on receipt of the final consolidated result from the returning officer, the commission shall, within 14 days from the date of the polling day, publish in the official gazette the name of the winning candidate.
However, Section 98(3) of electoral law also said that every returned candidate shall within 10 days from the election submit a return of election expenses and those who lost the election shall submit the same within 30 days.
ECP officials told Dawn that all JI candidates, including Hafiz  Naeem, had submitted their statements of election expenses within the 30-day period in compliance  with the Election Act 2017.
It may be noted that a few days after the Feb 8 general elections, Hafiz Naeem had announced that he would not accept the victory as the PA seat in question was actually won by the PTI-backed candidate and not him.
On March 28, the SHC had put the ECP and other respondents on notice for April 9 on the petition of the PTI-backed aspirant with direction to file comments.
The petitioner argued that the ECP through the provisional result had declared Hafiz Naeem as returned candidate from the constituency, but did not issue a notification.
He submitted that a per Form-45s he had won the election and Hafiz Naeem had himself publicly admitted this fact.
He maintained that JI city chief might not submit a return of election expenses to the ECP.
The petitioner sought a directive for the ECP to issue the notification about the returned candidate so that he could challenge it before an election tribunal. 
SHC disposes of JI aspirants’ pleas against ECP
The  Sindh High Court on Monday disposed of contempt applications filed by  five aspirants of Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) against election watchdog for not  deciding their complaints against provisional results of five Sindh  Assembly seats from the city.
Citing the Election  Commission of Pakistan, chief election commissioner and others as  alleged contemnors, JI aspirants in their contempt applications  submitted that they had not complied with the SHC order passed on in  February regarding election complaints of applicants.
When  the two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi took up  the matter for hearing on Monday, a deputy attorney general (DAG)  submitted that the ECP had passed short orders on such complaints and  subsequently, detailed reasons had also been communicated to the  petitioners and, therefore, such applications had become infructuous.
“Prima  facie, it appears that for the aforesaid reasons, learned counsel for  petitioners have not come forward to pursue the contempt applications,  which are accordingly disposed of in view of statement of learned DAG”,  it added.
The petitioners, Jawaid Mukati, Mohammad  Akbar, Mohammad Ahmed, Nusratullah and Syed Wajih Hassan submitted that  in February, the SHC had disposed of their petitions against provisional  results of these constituencies and had ordered ECP to decide the  petitioners’ complaints through speaking orders before Feb 22, but the  same had not been complied with as detailed orders were still awaited.
Earlier, Junaid Mukati challenged the victory of Mohammad Daniyal from PS-104, Mohammad Akbar impugned the victory of Abdul Waseem from PS-123, Mohammad Ahmed filed a petition against returned candidate Abdul Basit from PS-124, Nusratullah approached the tribunal to get Mohammad Iftikhar Alam de-seated from PS-126 and Syed Wajih Hasan challenged the victory of Taha Ahmed Khan from PS-128.
The  petitioners had submitted that as per Form-45s, they had easily won the  constituencies in question, but the results were fraudulently changed  and the petitioners were shown runner-ups in the impugned From-47s.

10,KCCI demands decisive operation in riverine areas to eliminate gangs,"Says business community faces huge losses, safe travel on highways in night hours almost impossible","KARACHI: Expressing his grave concerns over the law and order situation along all highways in Sindh having turned extremely dangerous due to dacoit gangs’ criminal activities, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry (KCCI) Acting President Altaf A. Ghaffar has appealed to Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and the provincial police chief to launch a ‘grand and decisive’ operation against the gangs, which have destroyed peace in the province.
In a statement issued here on Monday, the KCCI leader   stres­sed that the operation against the outlaws must be carried out by the law enforcing agencies of Sindh and Punjab jointly in an aggressive manner. “A special plan of action must be devised to permanently cleanse the katcha area of crime,” he said, observing that the upper region of the province continued to serve as safe haven for the outlaws.
He was of the view that an ‘abnormal surge’ in criminal activities had been witnessed and the law and order situation, particularly on the highways in Sindh, had worsened to such an extent that safe travel after sunset had become almost impossible. 
Mr Ghaffar pointed out that gangsters took positions to intercept and loot commuters riding public and private vehicles, as well as oil tankers and container-mounted trailers laden with locally manufactured and imported goods, destined for upcountry, especially in night hours.

Says business community faces huge losses, safe travel on highways in night hours almost impossible

According to the KCCI leader, it is due to the deteriorating lawlessness in Sindh that truckers are now refusing to take shipments to the upcountry areas because of the high risk factor. If someone of them even agrees, he demands exorbitantly high fare with the condition to ply his vehicle on highways in Sindh only during the daytime. This ultimately delays delivery of goods and causes huge losses to Karachi-based businessmen, industrialists and traders.
He said that in such a situation, the city businessmen had constantly been approaching the KCCI for assistance. The outlaws had been fearlessly and mercilessly committing crimes at locations of their choice on highways but the law enforcing agencies seemed totally helpless, he said.
The acting KCCI chief observed that since the criminal activities had risen manifold, the vehicular traffic on highways in night hours remained off the road.
Gravity of the situation could be gauged from the fact that within a period of just two months, dozens of businessmen and truckers had been kidnapped while travelling along the highways. Usually the victims were set free either after ransom was paid or in lieu of the goods.
There was a time when the gangs had confined themselves to the katcha (riverine) areas but now they had been operating on highways and challenging writ of the state through video messages being uploaded on the social media, he added.
The KCCI acting president cautioned that if this most disturbing issue remained unresolved, it would further hamper economic activities in the province. Disruption in the supply chain and a sharp rise in transportation cost caused by the situation had already become a headache for the industry, he noted.
It is high time that the chief minister and IGP act to rid citizens of the persisting menace and ensure their safety and security, he stressed.

12,"Policeman, cousin shot dead by  robbers in Jacobabad",Armed bikers kill cop in Ghotki targeted attack,"SUKKUR: A gang of robbers opened fire on a family near Thull town of Jacobabad on Sunday night killing two persons and wounding two others.
One of the deceased persons, Asadullah Sundrani, was a policeman posted at the Jacobabad jail, and the other, Sulaiman Sundrani, was his cousin. 
Police and local media people said that Wafardar Sundrani, a social activist, along with his two sons, Sulaiman and Dawood, and a nephew, Asadullah, was on his way back home in Jacobabad when a gang of dacoits intercepted their car near Thull town and started depriving them of their belongings. The family offered resistance upon which the dacoits opened fire killing 25-year-old Sulaiman, on the spot and wounding Asadullah, who later succumbed to his wounds while being transported to a hospital. 
Wafardar immediately informed the Baho Khoso and C-Section police about the incident and called for a swift response, telling them that the gangsters had just left the spot but none from the two police stations could make it timely.

A number of people from the nearby localities gathered there and arranged transportation of the family to the Thull hospital. The doctors who examined the victims pronounced Sulaiman dead on arrival and referred Dawood and Asadullah to a major hospital due to their precarious condition. However, Asadullah succumbed to his wounds on the way, sources said.
A little after the incident, enraged residents of Baho Khoso and other areas assembled at the crime scene and staged a noisy demonstration against police for their failure to ensure safety and security of citizens. They condemned the Jacobabad police for having lost control of criminal gangs which, they said, were operating in the entire district fearlessly, kidnapping and killing people at their whim.
Jacobabad SSP Syed Sulaiman Shah proceeded to the protest venue and assured them of appropriate action agai­nst negligent police officials of the area.
He ordered suspension of the Baho Khoso SHO and an inquiry into his performance. He told the protesters that the gangsters involved in the incident would be arrested as soon as possible. 
Meanwhile, the dead bodies were handed over to the heirs who took them to their native village for burial after medico-legal formalities.
On Monday, a large number of Sundrani community members led by leaders of different political parties and social organisations attended funeral prayers of Sulaiman and Asadullah in their village.
Police operation
SSP Shah in the evening led a strong contingent of police to launch an operation in the nearby riverine area of Jacobabad in an extensive hunt for the gangsters. 
The police demolished and torched a number of structures believed to be used by gangs as their hideouts.
The police said that raids were also conducted on various houses in Nandwani and Malhar villages within the jurisdiction of the Baho Khoso police station on suspicion of the killers of Sundrani community members having taken shelter there. 
Several suspects were rounded up for interrogation, they said, adding that the search operation would continue till the arrest of the culprits.

The policeman was driving through the by-pass within the jurisdiction of the C-Section police station of Ghotki district when he came under the attack. The assailants sped away after committing the crime near Shelton Hotel.
The police proceeded to the crime scene and shifted the body to the Ghotki Civil Hospital for a postmortem examination.
They cordoned off the area and mounted a search for the killers.
Ghulam Nabi Sahito was currently posted at the B-Section police station of Ghotki.

The leaders, Khalid Arain, Imamdin, Mohammad Ismail, Mohammad Ali Bhurgari, Furqan Ahmed and others, speaking at the local press club on Monday, deplored that no procurement centre had been opened in Mirpurkhas district, making the wheat growers of the area running from pillar to post for obtaining gunny bags and selling their produce.
They said growers were compelled to sell away their crop at a rate of around 3,500 a maund, far less than the official price of Rs4,000 a maund, to middlemen and hoarders.
They urged the government to take notice of the issue and immediately take remedial measures.
