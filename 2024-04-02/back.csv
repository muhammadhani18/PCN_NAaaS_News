0,US anti-Muslim incidents hit record high in 2023 due to Israel's war on Gaza,"The most numerous complaints in 2023 were in the categories of immigration and asylum, employment discrimination","Reported discrimination and attacks against Muslims and Palestinians reached a record high in the US in 2023, driven by rising Islamophobia and bias as the Israel's war on Gaza raged late in the year, data from an advocacy group showed on Tuesday.
Complaints totaled 8,061 in 2023, a 56% rise from the year before and the highest since the Council on American-Islamic Relations began records nearly 30 years ago. About 3,600 of those incidents occurred from October to December, CAIR said.
Human rights advocates have similarly reported a global rise in Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian bias and antisemitism since the latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East.
US incidents have included the fatal October stabbing of 6-year-old Palestinian American Wadea Al-Fayoume in Illinois, the November shooting of three students, opens new tab of Palestinian descent in Vermont and the February stabbing of a Palestinian American man, opens new tab in Texas.
CAIR's report said 2023 saw a ""resurgence of anti-Muslim hate"" after the first ever recorded annual drop in complaints in 2022. In the first nine months of 2023, such incidents averaged around 500 a month before jumping to nearly 1,200 a month in the last quarter.
""The primary force behind this wave of heightened Islamophobia was the escalation of violence in Israel and Palestine in October 2023,"" the report said.

The most numerous complaints in 2023 were in the categories of immigration and asylum, employment discrimination, hate crimes and education discrimination, CAIR said.
Palestinian resistance group Hamas attacked, Israel on Oct. 7. Israel's subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed over 32,000 people, according to the local health ministry, displaced nearly all of its 2.3 million population, put Gaza on the brink of starvation, and led to genocide allegations, that Israel denies.
CAIR said it compiled the numbers by reviewing public statements and videos as well as reports from public calls, emails and an online complaint system. It contacted people whose incidents were reported in the media.

1,"Spain to recognise Palestinian statehood by July, leader says","Since 1988, 139 out of 193 UN member states have recognised Palestinian statehood","Spain will recognise Palestinian statehood by July, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told journalists during a Middle East tour, according to several reports published on Tuesday in Spanish media.
State news agency EFE and newspapers El Pais and La Vanguardia cited Sanchez as making the informal remarks to the travelling press corps late on Monday in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on the first day of visits to Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
According to the reports, Sanchez said he expected events to unfold in the conflict ahead of the European Parliament elections in early June and highlighted ongoing debates at the United Nations.
He expected Spain to extend recognition to the Palestinians by July, he said, adding that he believed there would soon be a ""critical mass"" within the European Union to push several member states to adopt the same position, according to EFE.
At a European Council meeting on March 22, Sanchez said he had agreed with the leaders of Ireland, Malta and Slovenia to ""take the first steps"" towards recognising statehood declared by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
At the time, he said he expected the recognition to happen during the current four-year legislature that began last year.
In response, Israel told the four countries that their plan constituted a ""prize for terrorism"" that would reduce the chances of a negotiated resolution to the Israel's war in Gaza.
Arab states and the EU had agreed at a meeting in Spain in November that a two-state solution was the answer to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
Since 1988, 139 out of 193 UN member states have recognised Palestinian statehood.

2,What prompted SC to take a U-turn,Sources say SC judges wanted the apex court to take up the matter rather than referring it to the executive,"Despite endorsing the formation of an inquiry commission by a majority vote, the Supreme Court - led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa - has been compelled to take suo motu notice of a letter penned by six Islamabad High Court judges regarding interference of secret agencies in judicial functions.
Everyone is surprised by the SC’s U-turn on the issue. However, there may be several reasons for this change of hearts. According to sources, a minority of the SC judges wanted the apex court to take up the matter rather than referring it to the executive for the constitution of an inquiry commission.
Some lawyers believe that the main reason behind taking suo motu notice is recusal of former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jilliani, who was earlier chosen to lead the proposed commission.
The source said Justice (retd) Jillani was told that a full-court had endorsed his nomination. However, later he learnt that his nomination was not approved in the full-court meeting and the SC judges were divided on the question of formation of an inquiry commission.
They revealed to The Express Tribune that the former chief justice also asked the government to provide the minutes of the full-court meeting but the same was not given.
Some lawyers close to him also advised him not to embroil himself in this controversy. After talking to several individuals, Jillani decided not only to recuse himself from leading the inquiry commission but also questioned the legality of the commission as well as its term of references (TORs) in a letter. His letter was a setback for both the government as well as the judges who wanted an inquiry commission to probe the matter.
Some lawyers, however, said CJ Isa realized that the strategy should be changed in the IHC letter case after he faced criticism by lawyers and others and later decided to take suo motu notice after consultation with two senior most SC judges. CJ Isa finds himself in a battle of perception.
The government and powerful circles are not facing any difficulty during his tenure.
However, the PTI which is the largest party in the country, is showing mistrust and demanding his resignation. Several lawyers who had backed CJ Isa when a presidential reference was filed against him are now expressing disappointment with him particularly after his January 13 order which resulted in depriving the PTI of its elections symbol.
Now it is a big challenge for CJ Isa to ensure that judicial proceedings are not manipulated by state institutions in high profile cases. It will be interesting to see whether the SC on Wednesday supports the stance of the six IHC judges or the executive. There is division within the Supreme Court on the question of dealing with the letter issue.
A senior government official said that the inquiry commission was formed on the SC’s request. Now if the SC wants to intervene, he said, the government has no objection to it. However, he wondered how the SC could decide a factual controversy.
It is also being suggested that the SC should pass a ruling in order to secure independence of judges from the powerful circles for future. Tomorrow’s hearing will make it clear as to whether it is tactical retrieval or there is something else behind initiation of suo motu proceedings. Abdul Moiz Jafferii advocate said the SC had to revisit its decision to offer the six IHC judges as “sacrificial lambs” to the executive due to the widespread condemnation of the decision.
“A critical role was played by former CJ Jillani, who not only recused himself from the sham commission that a very confident government had notified, but also made it clear why such a commission could not deliver on any of the requests made by the IHC judges which could be best determined by the judiciary itself through the SJC to whom the letter was addressed,” he added.
Jafferii stated that there was also significant pressure from within the court, as the members of the bench who saw this as a capitulation were reportedly vocal in their dissent.
“This is a welcome turn, but it must be stressed that it is only a beginning. The judiciary must put on a united front through a full-court when it is next available and ask this government to behave itself.
“It must do so to reinstate the confidence not only of these six superior judges but of every judicial officer in the country, who faces varying degrees of executive pushback on a daily basis,” he added.
Former additional attorney general Tariq Mahmood Khokhar said the initial recourse to the executive for a commission of inquiry was an extra-judicial blunder.
“It represented a betrayal of the judges and constituted an abdication of responsibility, the right and duty, to guard the judiciary; it raised the specter of judicial ruin.
“Now we have a complete volte-face. It marks a shift in the CJ’s position, but there is an apprehension that the linkage between the judges’ complaint and their ‘misconduct’ remains intact ‘necessitating’ a joint investigation team (JIT).
“That would be a blunder of an even greater magnitude. Even with the best of intentions, no single minnow nor a school of minnows can hold raw power to account.
“The point is to guard the judiciary from ‘state coercion’ and not to set the stage for another purge of the judges for refusing to kowtow,” Khokhar added.

3,SC probe sought into IHC letter issue,Aitzaz seeks dismissal from service of individuals implicated in 'unlawful acts',"Senior lawyer Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan and the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) on Tuesday moved the Supreme Court seeking its own investigation into the letter penned by six Islamabad High Court judges, alleging undue influence by intelligence agencies in judicial matters.
Ahsan urged the apex court to establish a three-member commission comprising sitting judges of the SC ""to determine the officers and operatives of the ISI [Inter-Services Intelligence] or other persons, if any, are or were involved in such unlawful acts and to report its finding to this [Supreme] Court”.
He sought directives for the federal government to dismiss individuals implicated in “unlawful acts”, with no entitlement to retirement or other benefits from the national treasury.
For those who have already retired, he sought the cessation of any pensions or associated benefits.
Ahsan urged the federal government to enact necessary regulations to fulfil the clauses of the petition.
His petition referred to Article 184(3) of the Constitution to question the matter of public importance in the six IHC judges letter case.
""Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 199, the Supreme Court shall if it considers that a question of public importance concerning the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II is involved, have the power to make an order of the nature mentioned in the said Article,"" the petition read.
Referring to 184(3), the petition contended to investigate whether judges at different levels of the judiciary, including high courts and district courts, were being influenced by the ISI or the executive, as indicated in the judges' letter.
It also contended to investigate whether or not there was an ongoing strategy within the executive, facilitated by intelligence agencies, to intimidate sitting judges.
Lastly, it questioned the existence of legal guidelines defining the ISI's jurisdiction and accountability.
Ahsan asked the court to issue directions to the federal government to ensure that the prime minister, the chief of army staff (COAS), and the director general of the ISI issued immediate written directives to all personnel under their authority, instructing them to disregard any orders, whether verbal or written, that sought to interfere with the ongoing judicial proceedings or influence judges.
Read PTI demands full court on judges’ letter
He added in his plea that the court should warn them of the consequences of failing to do so.
Ahsan further sought for these directives to be made public by being published on the official websites of the government.
In its petition, the LHCBA urged the SC to commence an inquiry into the concerns raised in the letter penned by the six IHC judges.
The LHCBA sought the direct holding of a judicial inquiry by the SC judges into the allegations contained in the letter of IHC jurists.
The bar’s petition called for imposing stringent penalties on the individuals proven guilty of attempting to intimidate, influence, or interfere with the functioning of the judiciary in any capacity.
The petition referred to Article 209 of the Constitution, noting it empowered the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) with “vast” authority to “provide protection to judges and to look into the complaints and make recommendation for proceedings including to the Supreme Court concerning the independence of the judiciary”.
""Lack of trust in public institutions engenders autocracy and threatens democracy,"" the petition read.
The petition further stated that the issue highlighted in the letter from the judges of IHC concerned a fundamental constitutional principle -- the independence of judiciary.
It quoted that this principle had been recognised as a cornerstone of the Constitution, as established in one of the SC’s own rulings.
On March 30, following a consultation with Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and other senior apex court members after the letter was written, the federal government appointed former top judge Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as the chief of an inquiry commission tasked with probing allegations that the county’s intelligence agencies are meddling in the affairs of the IHC.
However, a day earlier, Jillani recused himself from heading the inquiry body.
In response to Tassaduq's recession, the SC took suo motu notice of the letter written by the IHC judges.

6,PIA goes under hammer on June 3,PSO green-lights divestment of flag carrier," 
The Pakistan State Oil (PSO) has given its consent to the divestment of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), paving the way for the bidding round on June 3, 2024, as per the request of the federal government to proceed ahead with the privatisation of the national flag carrier.
PIA owed Rs27 billion to the PSO for the fuel supplied for its commercial operations. Sources confirmed to The Express Tribune that PSO had indeed granted its consent in this matter, allowing the federal government to take the PTI privatisation process to the bidding level.
Amidst concerns expressed by foreign investors regarding political stability and the ease-of-doing business in Pakistan, the government had set a June 3, 2024, deadline for conducting the bidding for the privatisation of the airlines.
In a recent cabinet meeting, it was noted that there were primarily two concerns for the investors considering business ventures in Pakistan. One was the concern for political stability, which had been addressed after the elections and the establishment of a new elected government.
Regarding the second concern, it was noted that the economic and financial position had improved with the continuation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.
Consequently, a cabinet committee was established on outsourcing airport management and privatisation of the PIA.
The minister for defense and aviation was made the convener of the committee, along with other members, including the privatisation and foreign ministers, the Planning Commission deputy chairman, and the aviation and Privatization Commission (PC) secretaries.
Meanwhile, the Aviation Division reported that after the approval of a new holding company on February 6, to implement the Scheme of Arrangement (SOA), the federal cabinet waived the fee for the authorised capital in accordance with the Companies Act, 2017.
To execute this decision, the Aviation Division approached the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) for guidance on the incorporation of the holding company. The SECP advised that the incorporation of the holding company would require cabinet approval.
Simultaneously, the Law Division completed the vetting of the draft Memorandum of Association (MCA) and the Articles of Association (AOA) sent by the PC. The provisions of the MoA and the AoA were incorporated into the holding company on suggestions from the Finance Division.
The name of the holding company is PIA Holding Company Limited (PIA HoldCo Ltd) – a public limited company owned and controlled by the federal government. The primary business of the PIA HoldCo is to succeed specific assets, liabilities, and subsidiaries of the PIA Corporation Ltd (PIACL).
The authorised capital of the PIA HoldCo will be Rs53.5 billion, divided into 5,349,250,000 Class A shares of Rs10 each and 1,500,000 Class B shares of Rs5 each. The fee for the authorized capital would be waived. The paid-up capital of the company will be Rs10,000 only.
The initial subscribers of PIA HoldCo Ltd would include the Aviation Division secretary, the Finance Division secretary, and the the Privatisation Division secretary. These initial subscribers will also serve as the first directors of PIA HoldCo Ltd until regular directors are appointed.
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the PIACL would also serve as the CEO of the PIA HoldCo until a regular CEO was appointed. These details regarding the incorporation of the holding company and the exemption of fees would be published in the official gazette.

7,The case of a missing complaint,"IHC orders petitioner to submit copy of complaint lodged with FIA against Bajwa, others","The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has directed a petitioner to provide the complaint he purportedly lodged with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) against four individuals, including a former army chief and a spymaster, for violating their code of conduct and disseminating false information.
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq took up a petition on Monday filed by a citizen, Atif Ali, through his lawyer Raja Rizwan Abbasi, seeking directions for the FIA to initiate a case against former army chief Gen (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa, former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed, and two renowned journalists.
The petitioner claimed to have submitted the complaint to the FIA director-general's office to register a case against the former servicemen and journalists for breaching their code of conduct and spreading misinformation. However, the agency allegedly did not take any action on the complaints.
The petitioner’s counsel argued that the FIA was obligated to launch an inquiry based on the complaint.
The deputy attorney general informed the bench that the FIA had never received any complaint against the former army officials and journalists. Hafiz Arafat Advocate, representing one of the journalists, also stated that the FIA had not yet received any such complaint.
“The petitioner has also not attached a copy of his complaint with his petition. I am amazed as to how this complaint was even admitted for hearing,” he said.
The CJ noted that this point had not been highlighted earlier. “Let’s give a chance to the petitioner,” he said. The court subsequently directed the petitioner to submit a copy of his complaint as it adjourned the hearing for an indefinite period.

8,LHC suspends PP-59 vote recounting,LHC suspended the ECP's order and directed it to submit a reply to the petition," 
The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday suspended the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) order for a recount of votes in Punjab Assembly’s PP-59 constituency.
A single-member bench comprising Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza issued the stay order while hearing a petition filed by PTI-backed MPA Nasir Mahmood Cheema.
Cheema emerged victorious from the constituency in the February 8 general elections. However, the ECP ordered a recount of votes at the constituency upon the request of PML-N’s Bilal Farooq Tarar, the runner-up candidate.
Cheema later challenged the ECP order in the LHC. On Monday, Nasir Mahmood Cheema's lawyer, Faisal Chuadhry Advocate, argued that the ECP could not order a recount of votes in a constituency after notifying the winning candidate.
The LHC suspended the ECP's order and directed it to submit a reply to the petition.
