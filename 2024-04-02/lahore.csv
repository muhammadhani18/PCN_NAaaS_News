0,"Minister raids class-IX exam centre, orders arrest of eight officials",Says the controller had employed private persons as invigilators that caused the issue.,"LAHORE: Punjab School Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat has removed Lahore Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) chairman and controller examination for their alleged involvement in facilitating cheating during class-IX annual exams.
Lahore Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa, who has been given the charge of BISE chairman, has ordered an inquiry into the complaints. The additional commissioner (coordination) will be the head of the inquiry committee.
The minister also conducted a raid at an examination centre in Baghbanpura on Monday and ordered the arrest eight officials involved in facilitating cheating, including five from Government High School Baghbanpura and three from Shalimar College Baghbanpura.
The suspects confessed to getting bribe to give solved answer sheets to the candidates and also allowing impersonation.

Says the controller had employed private persons as invigilators that caused the issue

He said the chairman and the controller were suspended for facilitating the cheating mafia in Lahore. “The controller had given permission to employ private persons to complete strength of invigilators,” Mr Hayat said, alleging that he was threatened by the cheating mafia for exposing them.
He claimed that private school mafia had bribed the board staff to get specific centres for exams. “The centres were being sold for Rs80,000,” he alleged, adding that they had evidence in this regard.
He said acquiring a paper full of answers would cost Rs4,000 to Rs7,000 to each student as the invigilators had posted messages on social media about the charges.
The minister said he would continue exposing the cheating mafia. “So far, 30 suspects have been arrested,” he added.
The ongoing matric annual examinations under the Lahore BISE have been marred by widespread cheating.
Seven centres across the city were sealed and papers of hundreds of students were canceled after inspection teams caught red-handed superintendents, invigilators and students.
The scandal unfolded at the exam centres in various areas, including Sanda, Mozang, Sabzazar, Model Town and Civil Lines.
Meanwhile, Punjab Teachers’ Union Central General Secretary Rana Liaqat Ali stated that there were doubts regarding the transparency of examinations.
He said the suspension of chairman and controller would not yield any benefit unless the branch responsible for appointing examination staff underwent significant changes.
He said the appointment of private individuals as invigilators at certain centres raised concerns. “These individuals are often affiliated with academies, tuition centres, or private schools.”
He said since the centre superintendents were also involved in hiring private invigilators, it was inappropriate to accuse teachers and arrest them.
He urged the chief minister and the education minister to introduce immediate reforms in the examination system, including changing the paper pattern, increasing the remuneration for examination staff, imposing restrictions on private individuals serving as invigilators and involved in marking.
Meanwhile, Punjab Minister Bilal Yasin visited various examination centres of Lahore on Monday and suspended two superintendents and dismissed six invigilators for violating the rules.
He said polio workers and private people were appointed invigilators in the examination centres which was against the law.
The provincial minister issued orders to the education CEO to conduct a transparent inquiry into the issue.
Bilal Yasin paid a surprise visit to the Government Central Model School, Lower Mall, Central Model School, Rattigan Road and Girls High School Dev Samaj, Lahore.
The minister found five private women acting as invigilators in the Dev Samaj school. He suspended the superintendent and dismissed five private invigilators.
He also issued a show-cause notice to the Girls High School Dev Samaj principal for neglecting her duties.
Later, Mr Yasin suspended Central Model Lower Mall Superintendent Shahzada Usman for appointing a polio worker as invigilator.
The minister also expressed displeasure with CEO Education Pervaiz Akhtar for poor supervision and neglect of duties and issued instructions that the administration should ensure concrete measures to prevent cheating in all examination centres.

4,"No decision made to feature Nawaz on Kissan card, LHC told",Petitioner argues that misuse of public funds for advertisements by governments should be a matter of concern for citizens.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government on Monday told the Lahore High Court that no decision had been taken to feature the image of PML-N`s supreme leader Nawaz Sharif on Kissan cards.
An additional advocate general stated this during the hearing of a petition alleging that Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz approved the farmers’ cards bearing the image of her father, Mr Sharif.
The law officer said the petition was premature as no such decision was on the cards.
At this, petitioner’s counsel Nadeem Sarwar sought to withdraw the petition.
Justice Shahid Karim disposed of the petition as withdrawn and observed that the petitioner can approach the court again if any such decision was taken by the government.
Petitioner Mashkoor Husain pleaded through his counsel that using public funds for personal promotion violated the law and Supreme Court rulings. He said that in a 2018 ruling on a case filed by the PTI against the then chief minister of Punjab, the Supreme Court banned the promotion of political leaders, party flags or emblems by governments.
Similarly, he said, the PTI government in 2020 had to withdraw its decision to place the party flag on the Sehat Insaf Card and rename the card ‘Qaumi Sehat Card’ due to the apex court’s order.
The petitioner argued that the misuse of public funds for advertisements by governments should be a matter of concern for citizens.
He asked the court to restrain the Punjab government from issuing farmer cards with Nawaz Sharif’s image and to recover the expenses incurred for placing the former prime minister’s image on the cards.

LAHORE: The pace of desilting of major city drains has been accelerated.
Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) sources said the field operation teams were asked to ensure cleaning and trouble-free flow of waste/sewage water in all major drains and their final disposal to the designated spots.
Wasa is to clean/desilt Lahore’s drains, including Cantt Drain, Maulana Shaukat Ali Road Drain, College Road Drain, Sattukatla Drain, Shahdara Drain, Upper Chhota Ravi Drain, Lower Chotta Ravi Drain, and Sukh Nehar Drain.
Besides, the agency makes nearly 3,000km long sewer lines desilt-free every year. However, desilting of the Hudiara Drain is carried out by the irrigation department and not Wasa. Until the 1980s, the drain was a storm water drain used for irrigation and draining wastewater into the Ravi. It originates in Indian Punjab and running along the border; it enters Pakistan and passes along the eastern suburbs of Raiwind before ending up in the Ravi. Now, the drain carries sewage and industrial waste.
Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa visited the Cantonment Drain and inspected the desilting work.
Accompanied by Wasa Managing Director Ghufran Ahmad, the commissioner oversaw Wasa workers engaged in desilting and cleaning of the drain in two shifts. The commissioner learned about accelerating the desilting work in Cantt and other drains. He said the work on the 18km long Cantonment drain was underway at various spots using excavators and other heavy equipment.
“You are required to take action against all those involved in throwing garbage in drains, thus choking and disturbing the waste water flows,” the commissioner said. He urged the Wasa management to also plant saplings along both sides of the drain in a bid to improve the environment.
LDA: Lahore Development Authority (LDA) Director-General (DG) Tahir Farooq visited LDA One Window Cell and evaluated the performance of staff working in different sections.
He also addressed citizens’ issues and observed various stages of application processing during the first shift.
Regarding the processing of applications, the DG emphasised the need to expedite the processing of fully cleared files in the sifting process, ensuring the process within 24 to 48 hours.
“The benefits of sifting of the record should reach to the common citizens,” he said. Mr Farooq directed the chief town planner to present a comprehensive plan aimed at streamlining the approval process for building plans. During the inspection, he also reviewed the progress of applications received during the first shift.
He directed that challans for completely cleared properties in the sifting process should be issued within 24 hours. Additionally, the DG reviewed the process for the approval of building plans for commercial properties at E-Khidmat Counter.

17,Govt considers revival of ceramics institute,"Set up in the 60s, the centre has been lying closed for over two decades","

-Dawn

 
GUJRAT: Once known for offering training and research courses, the Gujrat Ceramics Institute has been lying dysfunctional for the last more than two decades due to negligence of the authorities concerned in the provincial government.
Official sources say the Punjab Industries Department has now shown interest in making the institute functional by relaunching some courses and research work in accordance with present-day requirement.
The institute, established more than five decades ago (in the mid 60s), would offer three-year diploma as well as one-year courses in ceramics and pottery manufacturing.
Students of this institute have long been serving in ceramics industries of Gujrat, Gujranwala, Faisalabad and some other cities.

Set up in the 60s, the centre has been lying closed for over two decades

The building and machinery have consistently faced deterioration and attracted rust.
“This dysfunctional institute is costing the government heavily in shape of utility bills and staff salary.
It is learnt that Punjab Minister for Industries Chaudhary Shafay Hussain has taken notice of prevailing
circumstances in the institute and other vocational training institutes in Gujrat and issued directions to the authorities in the local administration and Tevta (Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority).
The ceramics institute which is also know as Tevta Ceramics Display and Sales Centre, Gujrat, is currently under the administrative control of Tevta.
Gujrat Deputy Commissioner Safdar Virk paid an inspection visit to the ceramics center on the direction of the Punjab government and sought a detailed briefing from the staff on the reasons of suspension of training and research as well as proposals for their relaunch after which a detailed report will be sent to the minister for industries.
Talking to Dawn, DC Safdar Virk said that the Punjab government wanted to utilise these training centers for technical training of the youth, particularly in Gujrat and Mandi Bahauddin region, to promote the skilled human resource for the regional industry.
He said it could help in stopping human trafficking as trained youth could get jobs locally and abroad.
