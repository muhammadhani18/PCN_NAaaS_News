DAMASCUS: A part of Iran’s consulate in the Syrian capital was flattened on Monday by what was described as an Israeli air strike, a startling apparent escalation of conflict in the Middle East that would pit Israel against Iran and its allies.
The Israeli air strikes destroyed the Iranian embassy’s consular annex, killing and wounding everyone inside, Damascus said as Iranian state TV reported a Revolutionary Guards commander among the dead.
Monday’s attack was the first time the vast embassy compound itself had been hit, and comes amid soaring tensions over Tel Aviv’s war in Gaza and intensifying violence between Israel and Iran’s allies.
UK-based war monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said eight people, including several Guards members, were killed when “Israeli missiles… destroyed the building of an annex to the Iranian embassy”.

Revolutionary Guard commander among eight killed in strike; Tehran says it reserves the right to respond

Iran’s ambassador to Syria, Hossein Akbari, giving a lower death toll, told Iranian state TV that “at least five people were killed in the attack which was carried out by F-35 fighter jets”.
AFP reporters saw the annex building had caved in, and emergency services were rushing to search for victims under the rubble as sirens wailed in the upscale Damascus district of Mazzeh.
Reuters reporters at the scene saw smoke rising from rubble of a building that had been flattened, and emergency vehicles parked outside.
An Iranian flag hung from a pole in front of the debris. The Syrian interior and foreign ministers were both spotted at the scene.
Security forces shielded the site where earth-moving equipment was brought in to clear the debris and remove charred vehicles from the road outside, watched by a crowd of onlookers.
Syria’s defence ministry said “the attack destroyed the entire building, killing and injuring everyone inside, and work is underway to recover the bodies and rescue the wounded from under the rubble”.
Iranian state TV said among those killed was a senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ foreign operations arm, the Quds Force, Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi.
The Observatory said it had “confirmed the killing of a high-ranking leader who served as the leader of the Quds Force for Syria and Lebanon, two Iranian advisers, and five members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard”.
Israel has repeatedly hit Iranian targets during the six-month war in Gaza and typically does not comment about its attacks on Syria. Asked about the strike, an Israeli military spokesperson said: “We do not comment on reports in the foreign media”.
When asked about the attack, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said: “I am not going to comment with respect to this strike as we do need to know more.”
‘Heinous attack’
Iran preserves the right to take reciprocal actions against the Israeli attack in Damascus on its consulate, the country’s foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said on Monday, according to state media.
“Tehran will decide on “the type of response and punishment against the aggressor,” Mr Kanaani added.
Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad also denounced the attack after visiting the site.
“We strongly condemn this heinous terrorist attack that targeted the Iranian consulate building in Damascus killing a number of innocent people,” Mekdad said in a statement carried by SANA.
Iran’s ambassador, Akbari, said that “the Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate shows the reality of the Zionist entity which recognises no international laws and does all that is inhumane to achieve its goals”.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian called for a “serious response by the international community”.

1,Canadian police make arrests at  pro-Palestine protest,"According to a police statement, officers were engaged in crowd management duties when they took multiple people into custody.","TORONTO: Demonstrators alleged the use of excessive force after police apprehended several individuals who participated in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Toronto over the weekend.
According to a statement released by the Toronto Police Service, officers were engaged in crowd management duties at the downtown protest when they took multiple people into custody.
The police statement comes amidst allegations of excessive use of force from some protesters with videos circulating online depicting tense confrontations between demonstrators and officers.
Tensions escalated during the protest when officers moved to seize a truck within the crowd, prompting what the police described as aggressive behaviour from some demonstrators towards them. One individual was charged with stunt driving for purportedly operating the truck with passengers in the cargo bed while it was in motion.
Furthermore, two women are facing charges of assaulting officers. One of them is accused of throwing horse manure at officers, while the other allegedly attempted to strike an officer with a flagpole.
In a press release issued on Sunday, the police stated that four additional men were detained for allegedly obstructing the arrests of one of the women. Three of these individuals were subsequently released unconditionally, while one was handed over to the Ontario Provincial Police due to an outstanding warrant unrelated to the protest.
The Palestinian Youth Movement, the group whose Toronto chapter has organised several protests in the city since October 7, took to Instagram, alleging that the police used “brutal tactics” and “violently” arrested six individuals during the event.
The group says the march had been proceeding peacefully through downtown for several hours before encountering police intervention. Organisers claimed that several individuals sustained injuries when the police cordoned off protesters in a particular area and then advanced on foot and horseback. Meanwhile, police said it had not received any reports of injuries following Saturday’s demonstrations.
The protest was held to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and the lifting of the blockade in Gaza.

2,Turkiye’s opposition thumps Erdogan in pivotal local polls,"In post-election address, president calls it a ‘turning point’.","ISTANBUL: Turks dealt President Tayyip Erdogan and his party their biggest electoral blow in a nationwide local vote that reasserted the opposition as a political force and reinforced Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu as the president’s chief rival.
With most of the votes counted, Imamoglu led by 10 percentage points in the mayoral race in Istanbul, Turkiye’s largest city, while his Republican People’s Party (CHP) retained Ankara and gained 15 other mayoral seats in cities nationwide.
It marked the worst defeat for Erdogan and his AK Party (AKP) in their more than two decades in power, and could signal a change in the country’s divided political landscape.
Erdogan called it a “turning point” in a post-midnight address. He and the AKP fared worse than opinion polls predicted due to soaring inflation, dissatisfied Islamist voters and, in Istanbul, Imamoglu’s appeal beyond CHP’s secular base, analysts said.

In post-election address, president calls it a ‘turning point’

“Those who do not understand the nation’s message will eventually lose,” Imamoglu, 53, told thousands of jubilant supporters, some of them chanting for Erdogan to resign.
“Tonight, 16 million Istanbul citizens sent a message to both our rivals and the president,” said the former businessman, who entered politics in 2008 and is now widely touted as a likely presidential challenger.
Erdogan, who in the 1990s was also mayor of his hometown Istanbul, had campaigned hard ahead of the municipal elections, which analysts described as a gauge of both his support and the opposition’s durability.
Addressing crowds gathered at AKP headquarters in Ankara, Erdogan said his alliance had “lost altitude” across the nation and will take steps to address the message from voters. “If we made a mistake, we will fix it” in the years ahead, he said.
“If we have anything missing, we will complete it.”
Elsewhere in Ankara, thousands more supporters had earlier waved Turkish and party flags for a speech by reelected CHP Mayor Mansur Yavas, who trounced his AKP challenger in another disappointment for Erdogan.
According to 92.92pc of ballot boxes opened in Istanbul, Europe’s largest city and the country’s economic engine, Imamoglu had 50.92pc support compared with 40.05pc for AKP challenger Murat Kurum, a former minister in Erdogan’s national government.
Polls had predicted a tight contest in Istanbul and possible CHP losses across the country.
Yet partial official results reported by state-run Anadolu Agency showed AKP and its main ally giving up mayoralties in 19 key municipalities including big cities Bursa and Balikesir in the industrialised northwest, possibly reflecting strains on wage earners.
The CHP led nationwide by almost 1pc of the votes, a first in 35 years, the results showed.
Mert Arslanalp, assistant professor of political science at Istanbul’s Bogazici University, said it was Erdogan’s “severest election defeat” since coming to national power in 2002.
“Imamoglu demonstrated he could reach across the deep socio-political divisions that define Turkiye’s opposition electorate even without their institutional support,” he said. “This makes him the most politically competitive rival to Erdogan’s regime.”
Imamoglu’s rise
In 2019, Imamoglu had dealt Erdogan a sharp electoral blow when he first won Istanbul, ending 25 years of rule in the city by AKP and its Islamist predecessors, including Erdogan’s own run as its mayor in the 1990s. CHP also won Ankara that year.
The president struck back in 2023 by securing reelection and a parliamentary majority with his nationalist allies, despite a cost-of-living crisis.
Analysts said the economic strains, including nearly 70pc inflation and a slowdown in growth brought on by an aggressive monetary-tightening regime, moved voters to punish AKP this time.
“The economy was the decisive factor,” said Hakan Akbas, a senior adviser at the Albright Stonebridge Group. “Turkish people demanded change and Imamoglu is now the default nemesis to President Erdogan.” Erdogan said ending the second election cycle in less than a year will itself bring a reprive for the economy.
In front of the Istanbul Municipality building, flag-waving supporters said they wanted to see Imamoglu challenge Erdogan for the presidency.
Rising popular support for the Islamist New Welfare Party, which took an even more hardline stance than Erdogan against Israel over the Gaza conflict, also sapped AKP support. Imamoglu was reelected despite the collapse of the opposition alliance that failed to topple Erdogan last year. The results suggest many Kurds put aside party loyalty and voted for him again.

3,"US, Israel discuss Rafah offensive plans",Netanyahu vows to destroy Hamas; Israeli lawmakers okay ban on Al Jazeera.,"WASHINGTON: Senior US and Israeli officials held a virtual meeting on Monday to discuss the Biden administration’s alternative proposals to an Israeli military invasion of Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, opposed by Washington.
President Joe Biden has urged Israel not to conduct a large-scale offensive in Rafah to avoid more civilian casualties among the Palestinian population in Gaza.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the US had made its concerns known about any major ground operation in Rafah.
“If they are going to move forward with a military operation, we have to have this conversation,” Jean-Pierre said at a briefing. “We have to understand how they’re going to move forward.”

Netanyahu vows to destroy Hamas; Israeli lawmakers okay ban on Al Jazeera

An Israeli official in Washington said Israeli participants included strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer and national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi. They are the same confidants of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who had been due to attend a Washington meeting last week that Netanyahu cancelled.
‘Successful’ hernia operation
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — whose office said he underwent a “successful” hernia operation Sunday — has vowed to destroy Hamas, including in Gaza’s far-southern city of Rafah.
The premier was “in good shape and beginning to recover”, his office said in a statement.
Netanyahu is under rising pressure from the prisoners’ families and supporters as well as anti-government protesters, whose nightly street rallies have gathered pace and drawn many thousands onto the streets.
Israel bans Al Jazeera
Meanwhile, the Israeli parliament passed a bill on Monday giving top ministers the authority to ban the broadcast of news channel Al Jazeera — a step premier Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to take.
The law that passed by 70 votes to 10 carries the authority to ban the broadcast of content from foreign channels but also allows the closing of their offices in Israel.
Netanyahu had earlier vowed to take “immediate action” to shut down Al Jazeera in Israel once the law passes.
Israel had claimed in January that an Al Jazeera staff journalist and a freelancer killed in an air strike in Gaza were “terror operatives”.
In February, it alleged that another journalist of the news channel, wounded in a separate strike, was a “deputy company commander” with Hamas.
Al Jazeera has fiercely denied the accusations and accused Israel of systematically targeting Al Jazeera employees in the Gaza Strip.
The bill permitting officials to stop foreign media deemed to harm national security had already passed its first parliamentary hurdle last month.
Netanyahu’s Likud party said he asked “to make sure that the law to close Al Jazeera will be approved this evening” in Israel’s parliament, the Knesset.
Al Jazeera‘s bureau chief in the Palestinian territory, Wael al-Dahdouh, was also wounded, in an Israeli strike in December that killed the network’s cameraman.
Israeli forces have escalated attacks in Gaza for past six months.

4,Taiwan leader embarks on ‘peace journey’ to China,Says he aims to promote youth exchanges and to “reduce hostility and accumulate goodwill”.,"TAIPEI: Taiwan’s former president Ma Ying-jeou headed to China on Monday for what he called a “journey of peace” aimed at cooling cross-strait tensions.
Speaking to reporters at the airport before his departure, Ma described his trip to China as ‘a journey of peace and a journey of friendship’.
China claims democratic Taiwan as part of its territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the self-ruled island under its control.
Ma of the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang party oversaw an improvement in cross-strait ties during his 2008-16 stint in office, culminating in a summit between him and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Singapore in 2015.
But Tsai Ing-wen, who succeeded him in 2016, rejected Beijing’s claim to the island. Tensions have further risen since January this year when Tsai’s deputy Lai Ching-te — whom Beijing regards as a “dangerous separatist” — was elected to succeed her.
At the airport, Ma told reporter he hoped “when the situation across the Taiwan Strait is tense, we can convey the sentiments of the Taiwanese people that they love peace, hope for cross-strait exchanges and hope to avoid war.”
Ma added that he aimed to promote youth exchanges and to “reduce hostility and accumulate goodwill”.
Last year, Ma made the first visit to China by a current or former Taiwanese leader in more than seven decades in a bid to improve the “cross-strait atmosphere”.
On Monday, he said that trip “proved that this method is feasible and we can resolve cross-strait confrontation through building friendship between young people on both sides”.
Ma is leading a delegation of 20 Taiwanese students, and will visit tech companies, universities and historical sites in Guangdong and Shaanxi provinces before arriving in Beijing.
Asked to comment on Taiwanese media reports that Ma might meet with Xi again during the visit, the former leader’s spokesman said it remained to be seen.
“Since we have the opportunity to go to Beijing, former president Ma also hopes to meet old friends. But everything depends on the mainland side’s arrangements since we are guests,” Hsiao Hsu-tsen said.

5,‘Havana Syndrome’ linked to Russian intelligence unit: report,Moscow dismisses the allegations as ‘baseless’.,"WASHINGTON: The mysterious so-called Havana Syndrome symptoms experienced by US diplomats in recent years have been linked to a Russian intelligence unit, according to a joint media investigation released on Monday.
Havana Syndrome was first reported in 2016 when US diplomats in Cuba’s capital reported falling ill and hearing piercing sounds at night, sparking speculation of an attack by a foreign entity using an unspecified sonar weapon.
Other symptoms including bloody noses, headaches and vision problems were later reported by embassy staff in China, Europe and the US capital Washington.
The diplomats may have been targeted by Russian sonic weaponry, according to the joint report by The Insider, a Russia-focused investigative media group based in Riga, Latvia,Germany’s Der Spiegel and CBS’s 60 Minutes.

Moscow dismisses the allegations as ‘baseless’

The year-long investigation “uncovered evidence suggesting that unexplained anomalous health incidents, also known as Havana Syndrome, may have their origin in the use of directed energy weapons wielded by members of (the Russian GRU) Unit 29155,” the report said.
Russia’s 29155 unit is responsible for foreign operations and has been blamed for several international incidents, including the attempted poisoning of defector Sergei Skripal in Britain in 2018.
The investigation also reported that senior members of Unit 29155 received awards and promotions for work related to the development of “non-lethal acoustic weapons”.
Russia dismisses report
Moscow dismissed the allegations as “groundless” on Monday.
“This is not a new topic at all; for many years the topic of the so-called ‘Havana Syndrome’ has been exaggerated in the press, and from the very beginning it was linked to accusations against the Russian side,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about the report.
“But no one has ever published or expressed any convincing evidence of these unfounded accusations anywhere,” Peskov said. “Therefore, all this is nothing more than baseless, unfounded accusations by the media.”
A US intelligence investigation whose findings were released last year found that it was “very unlikely” a foreign adversary was responsible for the ailment, first reported by US embassy officials in the Cuban capital Havana in 2016.
Washington closed its Havana immigration office in 2018 under a US policy shift towards Cuba and also in response to fears at the time that the Havana Syndrome“ was a result of a microwave or other electronic attack.
US intelligence also said in 2022 that intense directed energy from an external source could have caused some cases of Havana Syndrome, officially known as anomalous health incidents (AHIs).
Washington announced the reopening of its immigration office in Havana in August 2023.
The joint investigation suggests the first cases of Havana Syndrome may have occurred in Germany two years earlier than the cases reported in Havana in 2016 that gave the syndrome its name.
“There were likely attacks two years earlier in Frankfurt, Germany, when a US government employee stationed at the consulate there was knocked unconscious by something akin to a strong energy beam,” the report said.
The New Yorker reported in July 2021 that about two dozen US intelligence officers, diplomats and other government officials in Austria had reported problems similar to the Havana Syndrome since President Joe Biden took office the same year.
The United States deployed medical and scientific experts to study the alleged attacks and those affected have been extensively examined to try to understand their afflictions.
