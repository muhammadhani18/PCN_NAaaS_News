0,Tough road ahead for female delivery riders,"While many have had positive experiences, some complain of the harassment they face on the job from customers","In the bustling streets of Lahore, a shift is underway in the food delivery industry. Traditionally dominated by male riders, a growing number of women are now taking up this role, challenging stereotypes and embracing opportunities in the workforce.
Muzammila Haji, a graduate residing in the Shimla Pahari area of Lahore, is one such trailblazer. Despite initial resistance from her family, she persevered and now balances her pursuit of higher education with part-time food delivery work for a well-known fast food chain. ""My dad was very angry when he found out that I wanted to get a job in food delivery, but after a fee arguments, I convinced him. Now my family is proud of me,"" shared a beaming Muzammila.
Similarly, Kashaf Nadeem from the Awan Town area juggles college during the day with evening shifts as a food delivery rider. Both Muzammila and Kashaf spoke of positive interactions with customers, which often resulted in praise and encouragement for their efforts.

While both recount instances of respectful treatment from customers, another female rider, who is associated with a leading food delivery company, anonymously revealed to the Express Tribune that encountering unwanted comments and advances was the dark side of the job. “One time a customer invited me into his home and when I declined, he offered me money,” the rider recalled with a visible look of disgust on her face.
Nazia Shafiq, another rider, voiced her discomfort at being subjected to stares and unwelcome attention at traffic signals, emphasising the need for societal change in attitudes towards women in public spaces.
Food delivery companies acknowledge these concerns and provide training to equip riders with skills to navigate diverse encounters. Umar Aziz, manager of a renowned fast food chain’s Gulberg branch, underscored the importance of this training in ensuring both customer satisfaction and rider safety. “We train our riders to face people with different attitudes and temperaments in the field. They are told how to talk to customers and how to keep themselves safe,"" explained Umar, which as per him has resulted in never receiving any complaints from either the riders or customers.
Be that as it may, Rashida Qureshi, who advocates against gender discrimination, contextualised these shifts within broader societal changes. While progress has been made, she stressed the need for stricter enforcement of laws protecting women from harassment to further empower women in the workforce. “If the prevalent laws against workplace harassment and harassment in general are implemented in letter and spirit, even more women will join the workforce,” asserted Rashid while talking to the Express Tribune.

1,Opposition decries govt response,Lawmakers find replies to questions in Punjab Assembly lacking,"Opposition lawmakers in the Punjab Assembly launched a scathing critique against the provincial government's perceived lackadaisical approach in addressing pressing issues during the session.
Led by Opposition leader Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar, legislators voiced their dissatisfaction with the government's handling of enquiries regarding the absence of a comprehensive plan for road rehabilitation across the province.
The government faced significant scrutiny as it struggled to provide satisfactory responses to various questions posed by the Opposition, particularly regarding road rehabilitation and law enforcement matters.
One of the focal points of contention was the absence of official representation from the police department during discussions on law enforcement issues.
Opposition members highlighted this absence to Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan, emphasising the importance of having relevant officials present during such deliberations.
On the topic of road rehabilitation, Minister Sohaib Bherth assured the assembly that efforts were under way to address the condition of numerous roads, including those heavily traversed by vehicles.
He mentioned plans to import specialised machinery from Japan to tackle the challenges faced by roads in Punjab.
Speaker Khan directed the minister to furnish detailed explanations regarding the permissions and fees associated with the transportation of minerals.
The speaker emphasised the necessity of keeping the assembly informed about any mechanisms established by the mines and mineral department concerning road infrastructure.
During the session, the Opposition also expressed grave concern over a recent incident of the murder of an elderly individual who had withdrawn a significant amount of cash from an ATM before being killed upon returning home. While the minister concerned promised to gather information from the relevant department, the Opposition stressed the importance of prompt updates to the assembly on such critical matters.
In response to Opposition's concerns about the absence of senior police officials in the assembly gallery, Speaker Khan issued a 10-minute ultimatum for their presence, underscoring the significance of their participation in the discussions.
Following the completion of the agenda, Speaker Khan adjourned the session indefinitely.

3,Protesting doctors resume work,Attend to burn centre patients while wearing black armband,"Protesting doctors of the Pak-Italian Modern Burn Centre (PIBC) responded to a call from the Pakistan Medical Association by fulfilling their duties on Monday while wearing black armbands.
Following a gas leak explosion at the Chaudhary Pervaiz Elahi Institute of Cardiology (CPEIC) which resulted in one injured being transferred to the centre, the doctors examined the victim. PMA Multan President Dr Masoodur Rauf Hiraj stated that the burn centre in Multan was the sole facility of its kind for the people of the entire South Punjab, which the doctors would not allow to be overshadowed by politics.
“In the interest of humanity, doctors have today donned black armbands and fulfilled their duties, although protests against political interference in the burn centre will continue until its cessation,” he asserted.
Professor Wasim Rabbani, who had resigned, said the protests would continue until the appointments made in violation of merit were withdrawn, allegedly including those of the executive director and senior registrar.
All those concerned have submitted their responses to an inquiry committee formed by Nishtar Medical University Vice Chancellor Dr Mehnaz Khakwani, but its final report has not yet been released. Meanwhile, patients coming from far off for treatment at the PIBC are experiencing severe difficulties.
The VC and Nishtar Hospital MS Dr Kazim Khan enquired after the injured patient, Amjad, 35. Emergency Director Dr Zahid Ahmad briefed them about the treatment besides other facilities for the patients.

5,Court bars official from daughter’s custody,Lawyer accuses Mengal of neglecting wife and child,"A family court has issued a notice summoning Punjab Home Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal on April 18 and restraining him from taking custody of his five-year-old daughter, who is diagnosed with autism, from his second wife, Ambreen.
Judge Jawad Zafar issued the orders on a petition for guardianship filed by Ambreen Noorul Amin through her counsel Mian Dawood.
The petitioner's counsel stated that Ambreen had married Mengal on April 16, 2018, with a dower amount of Rs50,000, which remains unpaid. Out of the marriage, the daughter was born on November 29, 2018, and has been under Ambreen's care since birth.
The counsel highlighted that the relationship between the spouses deteriorated after the birth of their daughter, with Mengal neglecting to provide for his wife and child.
The petitioner started an online business from home to support herself and her daughter.
Concerns arose as the petitioner noticed symptoms of autism in her daughter.
The counsel emphasised that Mengal, despite being a civil servant in BPS-21, had failed to provide adequate financial support, prompting the petitioner to seek legal recourse.
The court, after preliminary hearings, prohibited Mengal from taking custody of the minor and ordered him to submit a reply by April 18.
The court also instructed Ambreen not to relocate the child outside its jurisdiction.
The petitioner pleaded to the court to appoint her as the permanent guardian of the minor, stressing the essential bond between mother and child, especially given her daughter’s condition.

6,CM orders expedited issuance of farm loans,Co-chairs meeting on agriculture challenges with Nawaz Sharif,"Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has called for ensuring issuance of loans as soon as possible to farmers applying for them.
Co-chairing a meeting along with former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to review challenges of agriculture in Punjab, she instructed the agriculture department to devise a foolproof system of monitoring and feedback for the loan scheme.
It was decided in the meeting that Rs150 billion worth of loans will be given to farmers for the Rabi and Kharif crops.
The chief minister gave approval in-principle of the recruitment of agriculture officers and field assistants against vacant posts. She called for adherence to merit in the recruitment process.
She approved the establishment of a research endowment fund worth Rs500 million for the Ayub Research Centre. Moreover, it was decided to ensure coordination of the sub-institutions of the department for research, better performance and good governance.
It was also decided in the meeting that the Fertiliser and Pesticide Acts would be amended.
Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif said, “The lack of quality seeds even after the lapse of four decades is a matter of grave concern.”
He added, “Effective steps should be taken to plug the wastage of 37MAF of water wastage in Punjab.” He emphasised the need to use modern methods of irrigation for the purpose.
The agriculture secretary said 1.7MAF of water could be saved by paving 7,300 water courses.
A proposal to return rainwater to the ground by reverse pumping to improve groundwater levels was also reviewed in the meeting.
Measures to increase the rate of farm mechanisation in the province from 35 to 60 per cent were also discussed.
Nawaz Sharif urged the formulation of simple eligibility criteria for the farmers to avail loans.
