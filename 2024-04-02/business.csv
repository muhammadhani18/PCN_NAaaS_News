0,Trade deficit widens 56pc to $2.17bn in March,Imports swell by over a quarter; export growth slows to single digits.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s merchandise export growth in March slowed to 7.99 per cent after posting double-digit increases in the preceding three months.
In absolute terms, the export reached $2.55 billion in March, up 7.99pc from $2.36bn over the corresponding month of last year, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics on Monday.
The trade deficit widened year-on-year by 56.30pc to $2.17bn in March. However, the overall trade gap in the first nine months of the current fiscal year narrowed by 24.94pc to $17.03bn compared to $22.68bn in the corresponding period last year.
The IMF’s first review of the $3bn Stand-by Arrangement projects Pakistan’s export proceeds over the next five years to be much less than the commerce ministry’s ambitious target of $100 bn by the end of FY28.

Imports swell by over a quarter; export growth slows to single digits

The Fund anticipates Pakistan’s exports will gradually increase from $30.84bn in FY24 to $32.35bn in FY25, $34.68bn in FY26, $37.25bn in FY27 and $39.46bn in FY28.
During the caretaker government’s time, export earnings increased due to several actions, including releasing maximum sales tax refunds to exporters.
An official FBR announcement said that all sales tax refund claims of exporters created before March 21 were released. 
However, the FBR did not mention the exact amount of the refund claims.
The FBR paid Rs369bn during the first nine months of the current fiscal year as compared to Rs254bn issued in the same period last year.
The FPCCI has constituted an Economic Revival Think Tank which will be headed by former caretaker commerce minister Gohar Ejaz. The task force will identify areas for policy intervention to revive economic growth.
The commerce ministry has yet to announce the strategic framework for providing regional competitive energy pricing, working capital support, speedy refund payments, enhanced market access, and product diversification.
At the same time, imports rose by 25.86pc to $4.73bn from $3.75bn in March 2023. The import bill has rapidly increased in recent months following the government’s relaxation of restrictions.
These rapidly increasing imports would drive up the trade imbalance in the final quarter of the current fiscal year.
However, the import bill squeezed 8.65pc to $39.94bn in July-March FY24 from $43.73bn in the corresponding months last year.

1,Inflation slows to 20.7pc,Lowest reading in 22 months; remains below finance ministry’s projection of 23.5pc,"ISLAMABAD: Inflation decelerated for the third month in a row to 20.7 per cent year-on-year in March, down from 23.06pc the previous month owing to a high base effect and favourable domestic and global conditions.
It is the lowest reading in 22 months, down from a peak of 37.97pc in May 2023. This is mostly owing to the ongoing execution of tough conditions as part of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) bailout plan.
Inflation remains below the finance ministry’s prediction of 22.5pc to 23.5pc for March 2024. A considerable decline was noted in the prices of cooking oil and vegetable ghee, while a few vegetables like potatoes and tomatoes also saw a decline despite high demand in the month of Ramazan.
According to the IMF and central bank’s projections, inflation is expected to decrease in the final quarter of the current financial year. 

Lowest reading in 22 months; remains below finance ministry’s projection of 23.5pc

The government has hiked petrol prices by 3.5pc to Rs289.41 per litre ahead of Eidul Fitr, raising transportation costs for goods and passengers. This influence will also be seen in the April inflation projection.
Until December 2023, headline inflation had consistently hovered around 29pc for three consecutive months. It was mainly due to escalating prices of essential kitchen items, along with increases in gas and electricity rates. However, starting from January 2024, the inflation rate has begun to show a downward trend.
The first nine months’ average inflation for FY24 was recorded at 27.06pc compared to 27.26pc during the corresponding period last year. This exceeds the government’s projection of 21pc.
The IMF has also forecast the average inflation for FY24 at 25.9pc, a significant easing from the previous year’s 29.6pc.
The month-on-month inflation showed 1.7pc increase, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics reported on Monday. The inflation was recorded at 35.4pc in March 2023.
The urban inflation in March was 21.9pc year-on-year and 1.4pc month-on-month, down from 24.9pc and 0.2pc in February. The rural inflation was 19pc YoY and an increase of 2.1pc MoM in February, down from 20.5pc YoY and 0.3pc MoM in February.
Food, core inflation
Food inflation for March stood at 16.6pc in urban areas and 17.1pc in rural areas, whereas non-food inflation was 25.8pc in urban areas and 21pc in rural areas.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, slightly declined to 12.8pc in urban areas compared to 15.5pc last month. In rural areas, core inflation was recorded at 20pc, down from 21.9pc.
Main contributors
In urban areas, the food items whose prices saw the highest increase in March on a month-on-month basis included tomatoes (52.14pc), onions (28.04pc), potatoes (23.65pc), fresh fruits (21.90pc), fresh vegetables (12.82pc), meat (3.99pc), pulse moong (1.95pc), gram whole (1.92pc), beverages (1.75pc), sweetmeat (1.19pc), nimco (1.13pc), readymade food (1.08pc), sugar (0.65pc), condiments and spices (0.60pc), besan (0.60pc) and pulse masoor (0.54pc).
MoM decline was recorded in prices of chicken (5.54pc), cooking oil (3.42pc), eggs (2.78pc), wheat (2.02pc), wheat flour (1.29pc), vegetable ghee (0.80pc), mustard oil (0.79pc), bakery and confectionary (0.76pc) and dry fruits (0.06pc).
In the non-food category, increase was observed in electricity charges (5.11pc), tailoring (3.13pc), liquified hydrocarbons (2.90pc), readymade garments (2.22pc), motor fuel (1.70pc), personal grooming services (1.36pc), personal effects (1.30pc), drugs and medicines (1.19pc).
A decline is observed in non-food category of transport services (6.43pc).

2,Japanese firms reluctant to expand business,"Survey blames unstable security, exchange rate, high inflation for lowest interest since 2018.","KARACHI: Japanese companies operating in Pakistan are least interested in further investment to expand their businesses, while the country ranked lowest in the region.
“Unstable security, high inflation and an unstable exchange rate are major business concerns for Japanese companies operating in Pakistan,” said an official Japanese government survey on Monday.
The Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro), the Japanese government’s trade and investment promotional arm, conducted an annual survey of Japanese companies in 20 countries and regions in Asia and Oceania to determine their business conditions in 2023.
According to the survey, the percentage of Japanese companies in Pakistan that responded “expand” to the question “business expansion over the next one and half years” was 43.5 per cent, ranking 11th among the 20 countries and regions.

Survey blames unstable security, exchange rate, high inflation for lowest interest since 2018

“This is the lowest level ever, along with the previous year’s 42.1pc (12th place),” said the survey.
“Even in 2020, the pandemic year, 53.5pc (1st place); in 2018, 66.7pc (5th place); and in 2019, 62.5pc (4th place), Japanese companies in Pakistan have consistently been eager to invest in the past,” it added.
However, amid the current economic crisis, Japanese firms’ willingness to expand investment has declined significantly.
Japanese companies in India responded to the same question at 75.6pc (1st place), while Japanese companies in Bangladesh responded at 61.2pc (3rd place).
“Among Japanese companies in Pakistan, 93.3pc cited “unstable political and security situation” as the biggest risk, and 86.7pc cited “unstable foreign exchange” as the second biggest risk. 
“The 2022 survey reflected the significant depreciation of the Pakistani rupee,” said the survey, adding that the number one concern was “exchange rate fluctuations” and the number two concern was “higher procurement costs”. Japanese companies in Pakistan are facing higher import costs due to the rupee depreciation and the crisis in foreign exchange reserves is making it difficult to remit money overseas; these two factors are putting pressure on Japanese companies’ businesses, the survey disclosed.
Regarding “advantages of the investment environment,” 75pc of Japanese companies in Pakistan cited “market size/growth potential” and 70.5pc cited “low labour costs” as the main points.
It is understandable that Japanese companies have a high regard for the growth potential of the Pakistani market and a consistently strong desire to expand their investment, it observed.
The survey also examines wages at Japanese firms in the Asia-Oceania region. With regard to the “year-on-year wage increase rate”, reflecting domestic inflation, Pakistan ranked second in the manufacturing sector at 14.4pc, and first in the non-manufacturing sector at 18.4pc, which was outstandingly high among Asia-Oceania countries in the 2023 survey.
However, in terms of the “annual real burden of wages” in dollar terms, the summary of responses from Japanese companies in Pakistan showed that one employee’s burden for “manufacturing workers” ranked 15th with $2,370, while “non-manufacturing staff” ranked 18th in the region with $4,733.
The rupee’s significant depreciation against the dollar has increased import costs for firms. Inflation is also causing firms to face significant wage increases. “However, Pakistan is still one of the most competitive countries in the Asia-Oceania region regarding wage levels.”
“In Pakistan, unstable security, high inflation, and an unstable exchange rate are major business concerns for Japanese companies,” said the survey.
The government needs to urgently address insecurity, high inflation and an unstable exchange rate to get the economy back on a growth track, the survey added.

3,Oil demand sees a meagre rise in March,Overall sales fall 11pc in first nine months.,"KARACHI: Amid rising smuggling of Iranian oil products and claims of eroding market share of oil marketing companies (OMCs), local oil sales rose four per cent year on year in March and 3pc month-on-month to settle at 1.15 million tonnes.
However, oil sales during 9MFY24 fell by 11pc to 11.34m tonnes from 12.80m tonnes in the same period last fiscal year, according to Arif Habib Ltd (AHL) data.
Both petrol and diesel sales clocked in at 0.57m tonnes and 0.46m tonnes in March, showing 5pc and 4pc growth month on month and 3pc and 17pc rise year on year.
Furnace oil (FO) sales plunged by 11pc in March to 0.04m tonnes from 0.05m tonnes in February. However, March sales were 48pc lower than 0.09m tonnes in the same month last year.

Overall sales fall 11pc in first nine months 

In 9MFY24, petrol and diesel sales shrank by 5pc each to 5.30m tonnes and 4.58m tonnes from 5.59m and 4.82m tonnes in the same period last year.
A steep fall of 53pc was registered in FO sales to 0.84m tonnes from 1.79m tonnes during 9MFY23.
The paltry increase in petrol and diesel sales during March was backed by a slight jump in vehicle movements for election campaigns by political parties and more working days than February.
As March auto sales data will arrive by the second week of this month, auto sales play a crucial role in oil output. Cars, jeeps, vans and pickups sales remained 41pc thin to 59,699 in 8MFY24 from 101,426 units in the same period last fiscal. Trucks, buses and two-wheelers sales also showed negative sales growth of 50pc, 43pc and 13pc, respectively.
Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) in the last week of March alarmed the government over the influx of 4,000 tonnes of smuggled fuel daily into Pakistan, thus bleeding the nation of approximately $35.6m per month.
Price disparity between smuggled and legitimate fuel coupled with widespread availability and weak border controls is causing irreparable damage to legitimate business, the OCAC said.
Kati seeks cut in prices
While voicing his apprehensions over the recent hike of Rs9.66 per litre in petrol, Korangi Association of Trade and Industry President Johar Ali Qandhari demanded a more significant reduction in diesel prices to alleviate the economic burden on citizens and industries alike.
He said the expensive petrol would particularly hit the working class and low-income segments and continuous fuel price hikes could exacerbate economic difficulties, pushing more people below the poverty line.
On a Rs3.32 per litre cut in diesel price, he argued that this adjustment was insufficient to address the soaring costs of production and transportation. He cautioned that transporters were unlikely to lower fares significantly in response to marginal reductions in diesel prices, thereby failing to benefit both industries and consumers.
While stressing the urgent need for substantial reductions in petroleum prices to mitigate the economic strain on businesses and individuals, he hoped that the government would address the pressing concerns of the populace and take decisive action to alleviate their hardships.

4,FPCCI for speedy economic reforms,FPCCI President says a think tank comprising of experts has been established to steer the country out of the current economic quagmire.,"ISLAMABAD: Expressing a need to restore confidence in the official functionaries, the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) has asked the government to speed up taxation reforms and privatise loss-making state-owned enterprises, especially in the energy sector.
Addressing a news conference on Monday after meeting with Commerce Minister Jam Kamal, FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh said that the apex chamber has established a think tank comprising experts from various sectors to steer the country out of the current economic quagmire.
“The Economic Revival Think Tank would identify the hurdles and lacunas in the system and advise the government to ensure that the country’s exports reach $100 billion by 2030,” Mr Sheikh said.
He added that one of the key demands of the business community had been the continuity of policies and the eradication of the culture of obtaining permissions from multiple doors.
“The one-window operation has been established in the form of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), and the FPCCI has decided that its Vision 2030 will continue for the next seven years even after there was a leadership change in the FPCCI,” he said.
The critical issues faced by the business community and the impediments to increasing exports were the high tax rate and the high energy cost.
“We are also getting the wrong picture — there was no pressure from the IMF against decreasing taxes or lowering gas or electricity charges,” the FPCCI president said, adding that the only demand from the IMF is to streamline their business model.
