• Ex-CJP says his role as one-man commission may have violated ‘judicial propriety’
ISLAMABAD: After for­mer chief justice Tassa­duq Hussain Jillani refu­s­ed to become part of the one-man commission esta­bli­s­hed to probe the allegations of the executive’s int­erference in judicial affa­irs, the Sup­reme Court on Monday constituted a seven-member bench to probe the claims of meddling.
The decision to proceed under Article 184(3) came a day after a group of lawyers and civil society members wrote a letter addressed to the Supreme Court in which they said the commission was powerless to probe the claims made by the six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) detailing harassment at the hands of intelligence officials.
After the letter by the IHC judges came to the fore, Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa summoned a full court meeting, followed by a meeting with the prime minister in which it was decided to form a commission under the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act 2017 after the approval of the federal cabinet.
The cabinet picked Justice Jillani to lead the commission amid reservations by the legal fraternity, who said the job could not be ‘outsourced’ since the allegations concerned the judiciary.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, a seven-judge Sup­reme Court bench will take up the March 25 letter written by the high court judges on Wednes­day (April 3). Other members of the bench are Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Jus­tice Yahya Afr­i­di, Jus­tice Jamal Khan Mando­khail, Justice Athar Mina­llah, Justice Musarrat Hilali, and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan. The larger bench was constituted by the three-judge committee that det­e­r­mines the fixing of cases under Section 2(1) of the Supreme Court (Prac­tice and Procedure) Act 2023.
‘Violative of judicial propriety’
The suo motu followed a one-page letter by Justice Jillani to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in which he recused himself from heading the commission, while thanking the PM and the CJP for trusting him with the task.
According to Justice Jillani, he had gone through the letter written by six judges of the high court as well as the terms of reference approved by the cabinet as well as the relevant constitutional provisions like Article 209 of the Constitution that deals with the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
“Since the letter is addressed to the members of Supreme Judicial Council and its chairman the chief justice of Pakistan, it would be violative of judicial propriety for me to inquire into a matter which may fall within the jurisdiction of a constitutional body which is the Supreme Judicial Council or the Supreme Court of Pakistan itself,” the ex-CJP added.
The former judge said that he was also of the view that the terms of reference were strictly not germane to the subject matter of the March 25 letter in which the six judges had stated: “We are writing to seek guidance from the SJC with regard to the duty of a judge to report and respond to actions on part of members of the executive, including operatives of intelligence agencies, that seek to interfere with discharge of his/her official functions and qualify as intimidation as well as the duty to report any such actions that come to his/her attention in relation to colleagues and/or members of the courts that the high court supervises.”
Towards the end, the request made in the letter was for an “institutional consultation” in terms of the mechanism suggested in the judges’ letter, said ex-CJ Jillani.
In his letter to the prime minister, ex-jstice Jillani expressed his regards and thanked the premier as well as the cabinet for reposing confidence in him to head the commission, stating he was grateful to CJP Isa as also the senior puisne Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah for expressing confidence in him.

1,"PTI rejects ‘like-minded’ bench, demands full court",GB CM Khalid Khurshid says judicial conference should also be convened where all judges are allowed to tell their stories.,"ISLAMABAD: The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has rejected the seven-member larger bench headed by the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) to probe the six judges’ letter documenting the intelligence agencies’ interference in judicial affairs, demanding the matter be heard by the full court instead of “like-minded judges” and that the proceedings should be televised.
Speaking at a press conference along with former chief minister of Gilgit-Baltistan Khalid Khurshid, PTI central information secretary Raoof Hasan termed the suspension of PTI founding chairman’s sentence in the Thoshakhana case a ray of hope. However, he added that the sentence should have been quashed altogether since it was one of the around 200 “frivolous, bogus, and politically motivated” cases based on “political vendetta”.
He announced that the PTI would not accept the seven-member bench because the CJP constituted the bench of “like-minded judges” to get a decision of their choice, which, he said, PTI would not accept come what may.
He demanded that the matter should be investigated through a full court, and the proceedings should be telecast live, adding that a judicial conference should also be convened where all judges should be allowed to tell their stories.
He said that Tassaduq Hussain Jillani was a credible person and he took the right decision to recuse himself from heading the one-man inquiry commission.
Mr Hasan said that Mr Jillani stated in the letter that since the IHC judges letter is addressed to the members of Supreme Judicial Council and its chairman, the chief justice of Pakistan, it would be “violative of judicial propriety” for him to inquire into a matter which may fall within the jurisdiction of SJC or the Supreme Court.
He stated that former judge had endorsed PTI’s stance because they were also advocating that it was a serious matter and were demanding an investigation through the full court.
Mr Hasan congratulated the legal fraternity and bar associations for their unified stance and hoped that they would exert pressure in the same way so as to take the issue to its logical end.
He reiterated that PTI always talked about the supremacy of the Constitution and law and stood by the judiciary. He said that PTI never lost trust in the courts despite the fact that Mr Khan, other leaders, and workers had been subjected to “barbarities and fascism” during the past 23 months without any respite.
However, he stated: “Today is a great day for our party and the first drop of hope, as the nation’s beloved leader Imran Khan stood victorious and soon he will be released from unlawful detention to take the reins of the country as the Prime Minister of Pakistan.”
He said that the courts were virtually converted into kangaroo courts, as they were reduced to a tool of political engineering at the hands of the establishment, hoping that the practice of political engineering would eventually come to a halt.
Speaking on the occasion, Khalid Khurshid said that the judiciary was always fractured for vested interests that was the reason it ranked 138 in the world.
He stated that six judges did a commendable job by demonstrating great courage to expose the meddling in judicial affairs and vowed that they would let not rest and would take the matter to its logical conclusion.
“We have never seen such a judicial surrender in 75 years, as CJP surrendered six judges at the mercy of the executive,” he lamented.
Talking about chief justice’s “extension” reports, he said that it was all part of the “London Plan” as he would be “rewarded for his services”.
Meanwhile, PTI leader Muzzammil Aslam criticised the increase in petrol prices, claiming that it was Rs150 per litre during PTI’s tenure, but the incum­­bent government increased it to Rs290 per litre.

2,"Imran, Bushra’s sentences suspended in Toshakhana case","IHC to hear appeals against ex-PM, Qureshi’s cipher conviction today","ISLAMABAD: A bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday suspended the sentences of former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse, Bushra Bibi, in the Toshakhana reference.
On January 31, an Islamabad accountability court convicted the couple in a case filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for retaining expensive jewellery from the Toshakhana, after paying a nominal price.
They were sentenced to 14 years imprisonment each, along with a fine of Rs1.54 billion on both of them. The conviction also barred them from holding public office for ten years. Mr Khan and his wife had challenged their convictions in February.
On Monday, an IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb suspended the sentences after the NAB special prosecutor did not oppose the plea.

IHC to hear appeals against ex-PM, Qureshi’s cipher conviction today

Barrister Ali Zafar appeared as the counsel for the ex-premier and his spouse, while NAB prosecutor Amjad Pervaiz was also present.
Barrister Zafar had requested the court to also set aside the conviction. However, the bench noted that since an appeal seeking similar relief for Mr Khan in another case was pending before the Supreme Court, the IHC could not set aside the conviction.
The hearing on appeals against conviction will continue after Eidul Fitr.
The same bench would also take up the appeals against conviction of Mr Khan and former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi in the cipher case today (Tuesday).
The court is scheduled to hear the defence counsel’s arguments from 1pm to 4pm.
While hearing appeals against the Toshakhana reference, the IHC CJ remarked that the proceedings in the cipher case might conclude in the next two to three hearings.
The former prime minister and first lady were accused by NAB of retaining expensive ‘Graff’ jewellery worth Rs300m along with Rs9m accessories.
Mr Khan had contended that the evaluation of gifts done by NAB was based on the estimates of a part-time salesman. He claimed his legal team had the evidence of the real value of the jewellery set, which they could corroborate with the appraiser if allowed the cross examination.
This wasn’t allowed as then-accountability court judge Mohammad Bashir closed the defence counsel’s right to cross-examine witnesses.

3,Israel leaves Gaza’s largest hospital in ruins,Health ministry says Al-Shifa hospital is now “completely out of service”.,"

GAZA STRIP: Charred buildings and a rubble strewn expanse littered with bodies were all that was left of the Al-Shifa hospital complex on Monday, after Israeli forces ended a two-week offensive at what used to be Gaza’s largest medical facility.
The health ministry in Gaza said that after heavy Israeli air strikes and tank fire, “the scale of the destruction inside the complex and the buildings around it is very large”.
“Dozens of bodies, some of them decomposed, have been recovered from, in and around the Al-Shifa medical complex,” it said, adding that the hospital was now “completely out of service”.
Hundreds of people, including some who had been sheltering in the hospital prior to the Israeli incursion, rushed back to check damage and hunt for belongings.
Several doctors and civilians at the damaged complex told AFP that at least 20 bodies had been found, some of which appeared to have been driven over by military vehicles.
Several were found close to the west entrance to the complex, which the Israeli army used during its departure from the hospital grounds on Monday.
“The tanks went over them. Destruction. Chil­dren. Innocents. Unarmed civilians. They (soldiers) went over them,” one witness said, asking not to be named. A correspondent saw one badly decomposed body bearing tyre marks.
Following the Israeli withdrawal, the scene inside Al-Shifa hospital was one of devastation, with windows blown out, concrete walls blackened and volunteers carrying away shrouded corpses across the sandy wasteland.
The Gaza media office said Israeli forces killed 400 Palestinians around Al-Shifa, including a woman doctor and her son, also a doctor, and put the medical facility out of function. There was no immediate Israeli response. “The occupation destroyed and burnt all buildings inside Al-Shifa Medical Complex. They bulldozed the courtyards, burying dozens of bodies of martyrs in the rubble, turning the place into a mass graveyard,” said Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the media office.
“This is a crime against humanity.”
A spokesperson for Gaza’s Civil Emergency Service said Israeli forces had executed two people whose bodies were found at the complex in handcuffs, and used bulldozers to dig up the grounds of the complex and exhume corpses.
Footage on social media, unverified by Reuters, showed corpses, some covered in dirty blankets, scattered around the charred hulk of the hospital, many of whose outer walls were missing. It showed ground heavily ploughed up, and numerous buildings outside the facility flattened or burned down.
Israel’s relentless aggression has killed at least 32,845 people, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.

4,"Despite flak, Nawaz chairs another government meeting",PML-N supremo co-chairs meeting to review issues faced by Punjab’s agriculture sector.,"LAHORE: PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif continues to chair administrative meetings alongside his daughter, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, despite criticism.
On Monday, Mr Sharif co-chaired a meeting to review issues faced by the province’s agriculture sector.
Since the Feb 8 general elections, the PML-N sup­reme leader has generally kept a low profile. How­ever, in the few public app­e­arances since, he has been seen chairing or co-chairing with his daughter administrative meetings of the Punjab government.
This has led to questions, as Mr Sharif holds no official position in either the provincial or federal government and is officially only a member of the National Assembly.
Addressing the meeting on Monday, the PML-N supreme leader said the lack of availability of quality seeds even after decades is “a matter of grave concern”.
He called for “effective steps” to save 37 million acres feet (MAF) of water from being wasted during agricultural activities in the province.
He emphasised the need to use modern irrigation methods to save water. The meeting was told that 1.7 MAF of water could be saved by paving 7,300 water courses across Punjab.
The meeting also discussed necessary measures to increase the rate of farm mechanisation from 35 to 60 per cent in Punjab.
It also discussed the disbursement of Rs150bn loan to farmers for Rabi and Kharif crops. Mr Sharif issued directions to formulate simple eligibility criteria for the farmers to secure loans.
CM Maryam also approved a research endowment fund worth Rs500m in the Ayub Agricultural Research Institute in Faisalabad. The meeting also decided to amend the Fertiliser and Pesticide Act.
Provincial ministers Marri­yum Aurangzeb, Azma Zahid Bukhari and Ashiq Hussain Kirmani; PML-N leader Pervaiz Rashid and other officials attended the meeting.
Separately on Monday, CM Maryam chaired a joint meeting of the parliamentary parties of PML-N, PPP and PML-Q to discuss the strategy for Senate elections.
PPP parliamentary party leader Ali Haider Gilani assured the CM of his party’s support for PML-N candidates Bushra Butt and Anusha Rahman, who are contesting on women’s seats.

5,Work on Chinese projects to continue at full pace: PM,Ambassador Jiang calls on govt to ‘flush out terrorists’ from the country,"

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif shakes hands with an engineer belonging to the China Gezhouba Group Company at the Dasu project, on Monday.—APP

 
MANSEHRA: Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif on Monday said enemies’ evil designs to end the China-Pakistan friendship would never succeed, and all mega development projects being executed by Beijing would continue with full pace and might.
“I am here to express my heartfelt condolence with you on five Chinese engineers who laid their lives for the prosperity and development of our country, and assure you their precious blood would never go waste and perpetrators behind this cowardly terrorist attack might be taken to justice soon,” he said during an interaction with Chinese engineers and workers employed at the Dasu hydropower project, during a visit to Upper Kohistan.
The prime minister was acc­o­m­panied by Chinese Ambas­s­ador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong and federal ministers Amir Muqam and Atta Tarar. He reached Kass residential camp directly from the federal capital and expressed his deep condolences and sorrow over the demise of Chinese engineers in a suicide attack on their coach in the Bisham area of Shangla on March 26, 2024.
“I assure you and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Qiang that we would never provide such an opportunity to our enemies in future to carry out such a cowardly act on our soil,” he said.

Ambassador Jiang calls on govt to ‘flush out terrorists’ from the country

PM Shehbaz said he was saddened by the Bisham terrorist attack.
“I visited the Chinese embassy just after this cowardly terrorist attack carried out by our enemies who want to disturb and damage our friendship which is higher than Himalayas and deeper than ocean, and offered sincerest condolence on behalf of me and nation to the Chinese people and government,” he said.
The prime minister said he had constituted an inquiry committee to probe the Bisham attack and would act on its findings.
“We would never hesitate to act and take to justice all those involved in this attack as the committee constituted just after the Bisham incident shared its findings with us,” he said.
The prime minister said that the security of Chinese nationals working on the Dasu hydropower project and the rest of the country would be beefed up to a level where nobody could execute another ‘cowardly’ act.
He said that the government had taken the Bisham attack seriously and held a high-level meeting, attended by Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir, intelligence chiefs and chief ministers of provinces and other high-ranking officials.
It evolved a strategy to ensure no such subversive activities take place again in the country.
“We are going to hold a follow-up meeting within days to finalise our strategy to provide foolproof security to the Chinese nationals working on the Dasu hydropower project and other development projects in progress across the country,” Mr Sharif said.
Chinese Ambassa­dor Jiang Zaidong thanked the prime minister for his visit to Dasu to extend condolences and sorrow to his country natives over the Bisham attack.
“I am thankful to Mr Sharif for his visit here and condolence and all those actions taken by him to console Chinese and their families on Bisham attack, we want such a foolproof security that no such attacks could happen in future,” the Chinese ambassa­dor said.
He said the Pakistani government should also take extraordinary measures to flush out terrorism from the country.
PM Sharif and others present on the occasion observed a silence of 30 seconds for the departed souls.
