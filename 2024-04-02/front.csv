0,Imran claims Bushra poisoned in Bani Gala sub-jail,Requests court order for medical examination by doctor from Shaukat Khanum hospital," 
PTI founder Imran Khan made startling claims on Tuesday, asserting that his wife and former first lady Bushra Bibi had been poisoned while being held at the Bani Gala sub-jail.
He demanded a medical examination for her by a doctor from Shaukat Khanum Hospital, expressing distrust in the current medical assessment.
During the hearing of the £190 million corruption reference in Adiala jail, the former premier informed Judge Nasir Javed Rana that there had been an attempt to poison the former first lady and added that she had marks on her skin and tongue as a side effect of the 'poisoning'. “I know who is behind it.""
He added that if any harm came to Bushra, the army chief should be held responsible as members of an intelligence agency are controlling everything in Bani Gala and Adiala jail.
Imran further urged the court to order Bushra's medical examination by Dr. Asim of Shaukat Khanum Hospital, adding that he and the party do not trust the doctor who examined Bushra earlier. He also urged to have an inquiry into the matter of Bushra’s alleged poisoning.
Following the former premier’s request, the court directed Imran to submit a detailed application regarding the former first lady's medical examination.
‘Toilet cleaner mixed into food'
Meanwhile, during the hearing, Bushra spoke to the media, addressing rumours circulating within the party that labelled her as an 'American agent'.
She disclosed a distressing incident, stating that she had been poisoned by ""three drops"" of a common toilet cleaner mixed into her food, causing her health to deteriorate over a month.
Describing her symptoms, she recounted swollen eyes, chest and stomach discomfort, and a bitter taste in her food and water. She asserted that suspicious substances had been mixed into her food previously, including honey, and now the toilet cleaner.
Refusing to disclose the informant's identity from her time in jail, Bushra said that she had been decently treated at the Bani Gala sub-jail but expressed frustration at being denied the ability to open windows for a period.
Previously, PTI had alleged that Bushra had been fed ""poisonous food"" during her detention, highlighting her severe pain. In a formal statement, a PTI spokesperson voiced concerns over perceived threats to Bushra's life, citing the denial of her constitutional right to medical examination.
Moreover, the party raised objections to the restriction on Bushra Bibi's family visits, viewing it as a violation of both constitutional rights and jail regulations.
They accused authorities of deliberately endangering her well-being.

1,Judges receive ‘anthrax-laced’ letters,Case lodged in CTD police station in Islamabad,"Eight judges, including Chief Justice Aamer Farooq of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) received letters containing an unknown powder, suspected to be laced with anthrax.
The incident, coming just a day after the Supreme Court of Pakistan initiated suo motu proceedings over allegations of the IHC's chief justice and other judges against spy agencies, has heightened fears of intimidation and raised serious concerns about the safety and security of the judiciary.
Last week, six judges from the IHC voiced their concerns to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) regarding alleged interference by intelligence agencies in the court's affairs, shining a spotlight on the delicate balance between judicial independence and external influence.
According to judicial sources, staff members of two judges discovered powder upon opening the letters, resulting in burning sensations in their eyes. Immediate action was taken, with affected individuals using sanitizer and washing their hands as a precautionary measure.
Confirming the receipt of the letters, IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq stated that the incident caused delays in the day's hearings. Upon discovery of the suspicious powder, a team of experts from the Islamabad Police swiftly arrived at the IHC to examine the substance.
Sources close to the investigation revealed that the letters, which displayed signs of intimidation, were sent by a woman who did not disclose her address. Furthermore, the letters were addressed to multiple judges, intensifying concerns about the safety of the judiciary.

Authorities disclosed that the letters were purportedly authored by a woman named Resham, wife of Waqar Hussain, prompting urgent action by summoning the Inspector General of Islamabad Police and the Deputy Inspector General of Security to address the matter.
Additionally, the suspicious letters have been handed over to the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) for further investigation, as the incident continues to send shockwaves through the legal community.
The development came a day after the Supreme Court took suo motu notice and formed a seven-member bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, to address the issue raised by six IHC judges who accused spy agencies of interfering in judicial matters.
The first hearing of the seven-member bench is scheduled for Wednesday (today).
In addition to the Chief Justice, the bench includes Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Yahya Afridi, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Mussarat Hilali, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan.
Last week's emergence of the explosive letter led to a crisis, prompting the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Isa, to face mounting pressure to adjudicate on the matter under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
Just a day prior, more than 300 lawyers from various bar associations nationwide commended the judges' actions and urged the apex court to take up the issue within its suo motu jurisdiction.
Meanwhile, a case was lodged at the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) Police Station in the federal capital over a complaint of a branch clerk Qadir Ahmed who received and dispatched the post.

2,No surprises as coalition sweeps Senate polls,"PPP grabs 14 seats, followed by 13 by PML-N; ruling alliance attains two-thirds majority"," 
The ruling coalition parties swept the Senate elections held on Tuesday in the National Assembly and the provincial assemblies of Punjab and Sindh, which brought no big surprises as the results were by and large in line with the pre-polls projections in accordance with party positions.
After the election, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led ruling alliance came in a dominating position in the 96-strong upper house of parliament with 61 seats, including independents, as opposed to the opposition parties’ 24 seats.
The near and over two-thirds majority of the treasury benches puts the ruling coalition in a comfortable position in both the houses to legislate and even go for constitutional amendments without facing any hindrance from the opposition parties.
Elections were held on one technocrat and one general seats in the National Assembly, seven general seats, two technocrats, two women and one minority seats in Sindh and two technocrats two women and one minority seats in Punjab Assembly.
The voting did not take place in Balochistan Assembly as all the senators were elected unopposed from the province; and in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, where the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) postponed the vote because of a controversy over administering oath to some opposition lawmakers.
The highest number of seats, 14, was won by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), while the PML-N followed closely with 13, according to the results. Two seats went to the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) each.
The parties with single-seat victory included the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), the Awami National Party (ANP) and the National Party (NP). Besides, three candidates won the election independently, the results showed.
Overall, the PPP won seven general seats, three technocrats seats, three for women and one for minorities. The PML-N secured six general seats, three technocrats seats, three for women and one for minorities.
The election raises the number of senators to 85, as the polls were postponed on 11 seats of the K-P, where some the newly-elected opposition members on reserved seats were not allowed to take oath despite a ruling each from Peshawar High Court (PHC) and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
The polling, held only for 19 seats, commenced at 9am and concluded at 4pm. In the National Assembly, PML-N’s Ishaq Dar won the technocrat seat with 222 votes against 81 of SIC’s Raja Ansar Mahmood. PPP’s Rana Mahmoodul Hassan got 224 votes on a general seat, against 79 of the SIC’s Farzand Ali Shah.
In the Sindh Assembly, where the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) and the SIC boycotted the voting, election was held among 20 candidates, contesting for 12 seats. As expected the PPP grabbed 10 seats, while the remaining two went to the MQM-P and one independent.
The winners included PPP’s Quratulain Marri and Rubina Qaimkhani, both elected on women’s seat with 59 and 58 votes respectively. On the two technocrats seats, PPP’s Sarmad Ali and Barrister Zamir Ghumro won with 29 and 58 votes, respectively.
Similarly, Poonjomal Bheel of the PPP was elected on the seat for non-Muslims. In the contest for seven general seats, the PPP grabbed five seats, the MQM-P won one while another seat was won by an independent candidate.
The winning PPP candidates are Masroor Ahsan securing 23 votes; Dost Ali Jaisar, 23 votes; Ashraf Ali Jatoi, 22 votes; Syed Kazim Ali Shah 22 votes; and Nadeem Bhutto, 21 votes. Besides, MQM-P’s Amir Chishti and independent candidate Faisal Vawda also won, each securing 21 votes.
On two technocrats seats in Punjab, PML-N’s Muhammad Aurangzeb, the current finance minister, and Musadik Malik, the incumbent petroleum minister, won comfortably, securing 128 and 121 votes respectively. Dr Yasmeen Rashid of the SIC, a third candidate in the race secured 106 votes.
On two women’s seats, PML-N's Anusha Rehman and Bushra Anjum Butt won with 125 and 123 votes, respectively. Here SIC’s Sanam Javed obtained 102 votes. PML-N's Khalil Tahir Sindhu received 253 votes to defeat SIC’s Asif Ashiq, who got 99 votes, on a minorities seat.
Last week, seven candidates for the general seats in Punjab were elected unopposed after five others withdrew their candidature. The winners included PML-N’s Pervez Rasheed, Talal Chaudhry, Nasir Mehmood Butt, Ahad Cheema and the government-backed independent Mohsin Naqvi.
Besides, two opposition candidates – senior lawyer Hamid Khan of the SIC, and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas Jafri, the head of the Muttahida Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM) – were also elected without a contest in the province.
Also last week, the treasury and the opposition parties in Balochistan reached consensus on the unopposed election of seven candidates, contesting on the general seats of the Senate. Later, the coalition parties also reached consensus on the remaining four technocrats and women’s seats.
Those elected unopposed included former caretaker prime minister Anwarul Haq Kakar, who contested as an independent; ANP’s Aimal Wali, Syedal Khan Nasar, Shahzaib Durrani of the PML-N; Sardar Omar Gorgaij of the PPP, Jan Muhammad Buledi of the NP, and Ahmed Khan Khilji of the JUI-F.
On the technocrats seats, JUI-F leader Maulana Abdul Wasay and PPP's Bilal Mandokhel won, while PML-N’s Rahat Jamali and PPP's Hasna Bano were elected unopposed to represent Balochistan in the upper house of parliament.New SenateThe election results showed that the PPP emerged as the largest party in the Senate with 24 seats, followed by the PML-N with 19 seats. Among its allies, the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) has four seats; MQM-P three; ANP, three; NP, two; and PML-Quaid one.
This raises the strength of the ruling coalition to 56. However, if five independents, including interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, former caretaker prime minister Anwarul Haq Kakar, and Faisal Vawda, support the government then the number reaches 61.
On the other hand, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) managed to bag only two seats from Punjab – one on the platform of the SIC and an ally MWM. With its previous 17 seats, the total number of its seats reached to 19.
It is expected that PTI/SIC can win an additional seven seats when the controversy regarding oath taking of members on reserved seats is resolved. Experts said that if PTI got reserved seats through its legal battle then its seats in the Senate can increase by nine.
The political experts calculate that if the opposition lawmakers on the reserved seats are sworn in and cast their vote in the Senate election in the K-P Assembly, the result may look like seven for the PTI, two to JUI-F, and one each to the PML-N and the PPP.
Currently, 42 senators are in the house, while six members who were recently elected in by-election have not yet taken oath. Once they take oath, the total number of the senators previously elected would reach to 48.
Election on 48 seats was scheduled on Tuesday, including 11 K-P seats. This makes the total strength of the house to 96. The number of total seats of Senate has reduced from 100 to 96 this time around as four seats of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (ex-Fata) were merged with K-P.

3,Ayub declared opposition leader in NA,NA secretariat refuses to recognise PTI-backed independent MNAs as members of SIC,"PTI leader Omar Ayub on Tuesday was declared the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly after the secretariat of the lower house of parliament issued a notification for this purpose.
However, the NA secretariat has refused to recognise the PTI-backed independent MNAs as members of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).
The notification came following the successful scrutiny of Ayub’s nomination papers as per Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the NA.
It added that Ayub had been declared the opposition leader with effect from Tuesday.
According to news statement issued by the secretariat, PTI Chairman Gohar Khan, Amir Dogar and Ayub himself met with NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.
It added that the nomination of the leader of the opposition was discussed during the meeting and Ayub’s name was submitted to the speaker.
The statement continued that the deadline to submit the nomination papers for the position was till 6pm on Monday.
However, as no other candidate submitted their papers by the deadline, Ayub was appointed to the slot unopposed.
Last month, in a formal move, the PTI-SIC alliance put forward his candidacy, submitting the necessary documents to the NA speaker’s office.
The development came in the wake of approximately 90 independent MNAs backed by the PTI joining hands with the SIC post-February 8 general elections.
The submission of nomination papers was initiated by Malik Amir Dogar, in the presence of SIC's leading figure Sahibzada Hamid Raza, along with MNAs Ali Mohammad Khan, Riaz Fatyana, Dr Nisar Ahmad Jatt, and other key personalities.
The realisation that the formal process of appointing a leader of the opposition had not been completed struck the PTI-SIC coalition during the NA session last month.
Read Impasse over NA Opposition leader continues
It occurred when former NA speaker Asad Qaiser urged the current one to give the floor to the leader of the opposition.
Sadiq, in response, questioned who had declared Ayub as the opposition leader.
The speaker then guided the PTI-SIC lawmakers, stating that they needed to follow the formal process, and only then would Ayub officially become the opposition leader.
Now that the NA opposition leader has been appointed, the Public Accounts Committee as well as special and standing bodies of the House would be formed.
In a related development, the NA secretariat has refused to recognise the PTI-backed independents as MNAs of the SIC.
The independent members were not recognised to join the SIC in the light of the Peshawar High Court's decision.
The current tally of the ruling alliance’s seats in the NA has been set at 226 while that of opposition stands at 102.
In the opposition alliance, the number of candidates who supported Ayub’s candidacy for the slot stands at 90 including the PTI-backed independent MNAs as well as those belonging to the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party.
However, two other opposition parties, the JUI-F with its 11 MNAs and BNP-M with its one, have neither endorsed Ayub for the position nor submitted their applications to field their own candidates for the slot.
According to the secretariat, out of 336 MNAs, 328 have taken their oath while eight seats are still vacant.

4,Electoral stage set for Senate race,ECP pulls out all the stops for today's Senate elections,"The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has pulled out all the stops in readiness for the nationwide Senate elections slated for April 2 (today), setting the stage for a high-stakes political showdown.
Anticipation is rife as parties within the ruling coalition, notably the PML-N and PPP, eye a potential bolstering of their ranks towards a formidable two-thirds majority in the upper echelons of parliament.
On the flip side, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), is expected to maintain its dominance as the foremost party in the new legislative body. However, its clout might falter in thwarting the governmental legislative agenda.
Polling for the vacant Senate seats is scheduled to kick off from 9 am to 4 pm in the National Assembly and all provincial legislatures.
To ensure a seamless electoral process, the ECP has deployed several measures, including the printing of ballot papers in different colours – white for general seats, green for technocrats, pink for women, and yellow for minority representation.
Moreover, the logistical groundwork has been laid out, with the transportation of election materials to returning officers completed.
These officers have issued the final roster of candidates vying for the 48 vacant Senate seats, encompassing 29 general, eight women, nine technocrats/Ulema, and two non-Muslim slots.
Notably, out of the 147 candidates who threw their hats into the ring, a staggering 18 have clinched victory uncontested, with seven securing Punjab's general seats unopposed. Similarly, in Balochistan, triumph came without challenge for candidates eyeing seven general, two women, and two technocrat/Ulema seats.
With the stage set for a fiercely contested battle, a total of 59 candidates are set to vie for the remaining 30 seats, encompassing a diverse array of constituencies ranging from the federal capital to Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
However, a potential snag looms large in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the Senate elections for 11 seats could face a delay should the K-P Assembly speaker baulk at administering the oath to women and minority lawmakers-elect from the PML-N on reserved seats, as cautioned by the electoral watchdog.
The stakes are high as these elections aim to fill the void left by half of the incumbent senators who bid adieu upon the expiration of their six-year terms on March 12. Out of the 52 retiring senators, elections are slated for 48 seats, with four positions abolished following the integration of former federally administered tribal areas (FATA) into Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
With the Senate's total seat count dwindling from 100 to 96, the ECP has issued a comprehensive code of conduct, urging parties and candidates to uphold electoral integrity and refrain from engaging in corrupt or illegal activities.
Number game
According to calculations, PTI boasts 20 members presently, with the potential to snag seven more from their Khyber Pakhtunkhwa stronghold. This will hand the party impressive 27 senators.
Meanwhile, if every MNA and MPA toes the party line, the PPP faces smooth sailing, anticipated to secure 10 to 11 seats from Sindh, plus one each from K-P and Islamabad.
With 13 senators in their pocket, the PPP eyes a significant boost, poised to nab 12 to 13 more seats, landing them the runner-up spot with 25 to 26 members in the revamped Senate.
Not to be outdone, the PML-N, presently with 13 senators, eyes an expansion, eyeing seven more seats — five from Punjab and one each from K-P and Islamabad. This projected haul would secure their status as the Senate's third powerhouse.
Interestingly, the Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakhtunkhwa Mili Awami Party, and PML-Functional face a Senate exodus as their members retire in March. With their Senate presence dwindling to zero, they've opted out of the race, aligning with the prevailing assembly dynamics.
In Punjab, after purportedly striking a deal under the table, the nation's three heavyweight parties – the PML-N, PPP, and PTI – have secured a clean sweep in the upper house of parliament. All seven contenders vying for the province's general seats have coasted to victory unchallenged.
Out of this fortunate seven, four champions ride the PML-N's chariot to success, while the remaining two owe their triumph to the PTI-Sunni Ittehad Council alliance.
With the stage seemingly set, three contenders are left to duke it out for the two technocrat seats following the graceful exit of Mustafa Ramday from the fray.
Meanwhile, a spirited competition is expected from Sindh as 11 contenders battle for the coveted seven general seats from the province. Furthermore, the stakes are high with three aspirants vying for the two reserved seats for women, while four eager hopefuls vie for the two technocrat/ulema slots.
Adding to the mix, two candidates throw their hats into the ring for the lone seat reserved for minorities.
Sindh's political landscape takes an interesting turn with Faisal Vawda, reportedly backed by powerful circles, throwing his hat into the ring as an independent contender.
With the PPP's stronghold evident in the provincial assembly, a strategic move to support Vawda could potentially secure at least five out of the seven general seats, leaving one seat for MQM-P.
However, should all proceed as planned, the PPP appears poised to sweep the remaining five seats from the province – securing both women and technocrat slots, alongside the minority representation.
On the other hand, The PTI-ruled K-P braces for an enthralling showdown as the MPAs gear up to cast their votes, determining the fate of 11 senators, with seven seats up for grabs in the general category.
