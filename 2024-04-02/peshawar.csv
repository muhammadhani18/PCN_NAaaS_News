0,Senate elections today but KP swearing-in issue still unresolved,ECP says it won’t hold polls if oath not administered to members-elect.,"PESHAWAR: With the Senate elections slated for today (Tuesday), the dispute over the swearing-in of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly’s opposition members elected to reserved seats is still far from resolved.
Those 25 lawmakers — 21 elected on seats reserved for women and four on those for non-Muslims — await the administration of oaths by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati to participate in the Senate polls.
The provincial election commission will send its relevant staff members to the assembly today (Tuesday) for the electoral exercise in line with the schedule announced earlier, according to a senior official.
He, however, said in light of the orders of the Peshawar High Court, the commission would conduct polls only if the speaker administeredoaths to MPAs-elect.

ECP says it won’t hold polls if oath not administered to members-elect

“We [the ECP] won’t hold elections if members aren’t sworn in,” he said.
In a related development, Speaker Babar Saleem Swati on Monday approached the Peshawar High Court with a review petition about its orders for the administration of oaths to the MPAs elected on reserved seats.
The speaker insists the provincial government hasn’t convened the sitting, so how he could administer oaths to those lawmakers.
A high court bench will hear his petition plea today (Tuesday) morning.
The provincial government is reluctant to call the assembly’s session for the swearing-in of the MPAs elected on reserved seats.
The provincial government has said it has yet to decide whether or not to call the house to administer oaths to the MPAs-elect.
“I cannot say anything about any late night decision [to call the sitting]; otherwise, there will be no session,” spokesman for the government, Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif told Dawn.
He said that the government was ready to go for elections if the ECP wanted to hold them.
“We [the government] won’t hesitate to render any sacrifice for democracy,” he said.
On March 27, the Peshawar High Court ordered the speaker of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly to administer the oath of office to the opposition members elected to reserved seats for women and non-Muslims and facilitate their casting votes in the April 2 Senate elections.
The order was issued when a high court bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Shakeel Ahmad accepted three almost identical petitions filed by around 20 opposition MPAs-elect and directed the speaker to include the matter as agenda item No. 1 on the first business day of the session requisitioned for the Senate elections.
The next day, the ECP hinted at postponing polls over the speaker’s reluctance to the swearing-in of lawmakers-elect.
On March 22, opposition members staged a demonstration and announced they would take the government to court over refusal to follow the orders of the governor for calling the assembly on March 22 for administering oaths to women and non-Muslim MPAs.
They alleged that the government wanted to deprive the lawmakers, who were elected on reserved seats and notified by the Election Commission of Pakistan, of the right to cast their votes in the upcoming Senate polls.
A total of 28 candidates are in the running for the Senate seats from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

The Chinese construction company, PCCCL, which has been contracted to do the civil work of the powerhouse, formally called its workers back to duty by SMSes, according to sources at the Tarbela Dam.

He told Dawn that security checks had been increased at the 1530 megawatts project’s site, residential areas of the Chinese, and their travel routes as per the revised security protocols in line with the orders of authorities.

He said the workers were “laid off” on March 26 following a suicide attack on a Chinese convoy in Shangla district.
“Now, things have returned to normal, with both Chinese and Pakistani workers busy with their assignments amid heightened security,” he said.
Mr Adil said work on the Diamer-Bhasha Dam would also resume on Tuesday as the PCCCL executing the project had asked all workers to return to work.
The Shangla suicide attack left five Chinese engineers and a Pakistani driver dead.
In July 2021, a similar bus attack near the site of the Dasu hydropower project killed 13 passengers, including nine Chinese nationals, and injured 23.
Two of the 12 suspected attackers — Mohammad Hussain and Mohammad Ayaz — were convicted of terrorism by the trial court. They’re detained in the Haripur Central Prison, with their appeals against conviction pending with the Peshawar High Court.
Four suspects arrested by the counter-terrorism department were acquitted, while five were absconders at the time.
Officials said the T5 project being executed, meant for irrigation of the gigantic Tarbela dam, was scheduled to start generating 1530 megawatts of electricity in May 2026.

7,"Bara traders, medics reject taxes by TMA",Threaten strike after Eid,"KHYBER: Traders, doctors and transporters have rejected the tehsil municipal administration’s move to impose various taxes in Bara Bazaar here.
Backed by political activists, they insisted that the imposition of those “unjust” taxes was tantamount to their “economic murder” as they’re still reeling from the impact of over a decade-long militancy in the region.
During a meeting at the main office of the Anjumn-i-TajiranBara, traders association president Ali Mohammad Afridi said shopkeepers in Bara tehsil were unwilling to pay those taxes and were committed to taking up the issue with elected assembly members for intervention.
He said the entire Bara bazaar was destroyed by militant attacks, forcing most traders to migrate to safe places.

Threaten strike after Eid

“The bazaar remained closed for almost eight years and reopened in 2016 only after authorities promised to compensate traders for their losses and declare it tax-free for at least10 years.
Doctors association president Dr Sahibzada Rahim Jan said like traders and transporters, most of the local medics were unable to pay those taxes due to financial constraints.
Former president of the Bara Traders Association Said Ayaz later told Dawn that another meeting would take place soon after Eidul Fitr to chalk out a joint strategy on the matter.
He said the TMA charged shopkeepers and even pushcart owners Rs80 each on a monthly basis, while 150 rupees per square foot were collected from each of the shopkeepers for the boards installed at shops.
Mr Ayaz complained that the TMA asked wheelbarrow owners for Rs100 each, though they brought goods to Bara Bazaar but returned without them.
He said FIRs were registered against those who refused to pay those “unjustified” taxes.
Participants announced that if the TMA didn’t withdraw taxes after Eidul Fitr, then the shutters would be down across the tribal district.

Shahjee Khan hailing from North Waziristan district lost his life when robbers opened fire at him after he offered resistance on Peshawar-Karachi highway. 
On Feb 28, highwaymen had also killed a truck driver from Balochistan at the same place. 
Though the police with the help of security forces have contained militancy to some extent, thefts and robberies have gained frequency over last several months.

A social activist, Liaqat Sayam said lawlessness had forced people to settle in other parts of the country. “Though peace bodies have been formed with night patrolling by armed villagers, there is no let-up in robberies,” he added. 
He said residents, political and civil society organisations held demonstrations against rising street crime, but to no avail.

Patients also came from Atani and Ayun villages, which are supplied drinking water from Rumbur, making it clear the waterborne disease had spread to the downstream localities. 
After the blood-culture test of some patients came out positive for XDR typhoid, the Lower Chitral district health officer reported the matter to the director general health on March 22, who deployed a rapid response team of four doctors. 
The team consisting of Dr Mohammad Gul Sartaj, Dr Amir Bakhtiar, Dr Kaleemullah Khan and Dr Musawair had been tasked with conducting a thorough investigation and compiling a comprehensive report. 
However, the team has yet to move from Peshawar. Result of the test of water samples taken from the affected areas is yet to be received from Peshawar, which is of prime importance during the investigation. 
Sources in the DHQ Hospital told Dawn that so far 53 patients, including children, had shown symptoms of the disease, including high fever, acute body pain, chill and diarrhoea. 
They said conjugate vaccination against typhoid would help contain spread of the disease. They added restricting movement of outsiders to the valley was also an effective precautionary measure. 
District health officer Dr Fayaz Rumi, however, downplayed the outbreak fears and claimed many blood-culture samples had tested negative for XDR typhoid. He said there was no need for the rapid response team from Peshawar to arrive here on an emergency basis.
