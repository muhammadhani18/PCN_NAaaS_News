0,Power consumers to pay extra Rs85b,NEPRA approves tariff hike of Rs2.74 per unit under 2nd quarterly adjustment,"The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has approved an increase of Rs2.7492 per unit in electricity tariffs on account of second quarterly adjustment for financial year 2023-24.
The quarterly adjustment will have a total impact of Rs85.2 billion on consumers for the October-December period of FY24.
The currently applicable two quarterly adjustments of Rs4.43 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) shall cease to exist from March 30, 2024.
While considering the interest of consumers, Nepra decided to apply the second quarterly adjustment from April 2024 onwards, ie, after the expiry of the existing quarterly adjustments.
The second quarterly adjustment will be recovered from all consumers of ex-Wapda distribution companies (DISCOs) and K-Electric, except for lifeline consumers, over a three-month period from April to June 2024.
Thus, consumers will get a relief of Rs1.68/kWh in their monthly bills from April-June 2024 because of the expiry of previous two quarterly adjustments.
On Thursday, Nepra also conducted a public hearing on fuel charges adjustment (FCA) for February 2024. With a reduction in electricity consumption, the consumers should brace for another tariff hike of Rs4.99 per unit on account of FCA.
The tariff increase request, linked to February’s fuel charges, came at a critical juncture, marked by a 12.2% decline in electricity demand and mounting concerns over escalating costs.
During the hearing, the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guarantee (CPPA-G) disclosed a significant reduction in electricity consumption in February, which it attributed to a host of factors.
Nepra Member Rafiq Shaikh, while expressing apprehension about the mounting capacity payments, stressed the urgency of taking strategic measures to mitigate such expenses.
Meanwhile, officials of the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) emphasised the indispensable role of liquefied natural gas (LNG)-fuelled power plants to ensure stability of the electricity supply system.
It was informed that the growing adoption of solar energy across the nation had also left its impact on the escalating power tariffs as electricity consumption declined.
NTDC officials observed a rising trend in solar energy installations, particularly in areas like Lahore, where every other household was embracing solar energy.
The Nepra member noted the convenience of solar energy adoption for consumers but cautioned against its contribution to the escalating cost of electricity.
The hearing culminated with Nepra deferring its decision on the proposed price hike, pending further examination of the relevant data.
Nepra chairman underscored the importance of reassessing the existing tariff structure to incentivise business activities and ensure long-term sustainability of the energy sector.
CPPA-G sought an increase of Rs4.9917 per unit in electricity tariff on account of FCA for February 2024.
In a petition submitted to Nepra on behalf of DISCOs, the CPPA-G said that the reference fuel cost charged from consumers during February was Rs4.4337 per unit while the cost of energy delivered to DISCOs came in at Rs9.4254 per unit.
Consequently, it requested an increase of Rs4.9917 per unit over the reference cost. The price hike request also included previous adjustments of Rs0.5484 per unit. The petition, if accepted, will burden consumers with an additional Rs40 billion (FCA plus general sales tax). Data breakdown revealed varying costs across different generation sources, ranging from Rs1.3213 per unit for nuclear power to Rs27.1968 per unit for electricity import from Iran. No electricity was generated from high-speed diesel and furnace oil during February. CPPA-G submitted that a total of 7,130 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity was generated in February at a cost of Rs8.6950 per unit. The total cost of energy was calculated at Rs61,996 million.
Of the total, 6,876 GWh worth Rs64,804 million was delivered to DISCOs with transmission losses of 3.53%.
Hydel power generation stood at 1,766 GWh in February, which constituted 24.77% of the total production with zero cost.
Coal-fired power plants produced 1,129 GWh (local and imported coal: 994 GWh and 135 GWh, respectively). The share of local coal was 13.94% at a cost of Rs14.1863 per unit while the share of imported coal was 1.89% at Rs20.2194 per unit.
Local gas helped produce 787 GWh (11.04%) of electricity at Rs12.3794 per unit and the imported re-gasified LNG-based plants generated 1,450 GWh, or 20.33%, at Rs24.2952 per unit.
Power generation from nuclear plants stood at 1,660 GWh, or 23.29%, at Rs1.3213 per unit while energy imports from Iran cost Rs27.1968 per unit.
Power generation from bagasse was calculated at 101 GWh in February. Bagasse contributed 1.41% of electricity to the national grid at Rs5.9822 per unit.
The electricity generated from wind resources was recorded at 108 GWh, or 1.53% of the total generation, while solar energy contributed 90 GWh, or 1.26% of the total energy mix.

2,FTSE Russell retains Pakistan in secondary emerging markets,"Positive outlook, economic reforms propel Pakistani equities","FTSE Russell, the UK-based indexes and analytics provider, has decided to retain Pakistan in its “secondary emerging markets” for the next six months, surpassing market expectations for a downgrade. This decision has placed Pakistani equities on the watch-list for a potential downgrade, albeit with a positive outlook that anticipates increased business and economic activities. Such growth is expected to raise the market capitalisation of stocks to the level required for remaining in the secondary emerging markets.
FTSE Russell’s latest decision has empowered global passive funds—tracking FTSE decisions with assets worth $15.9 trillion—to inject new capital into undervalued Pakistani listed companies, increasing their stakes due to the bright outlook.
Pakistan’s (Pakistan Stock Exchange/PSX) market capitalisation plummeted to $21 billion last year from $100 billion in 2017 due to two primary reasons. Firstly, the Pakistani currency experienced significant devaluation against the US dollar over the past seven years, dropping from around Rs105/$ in 2017 to Rs278/$ currently. Secondly, stock prices sharply declined amidst economic turmoil and high political instability, collectively leading to the market capitalisation drop to $21 billion from the earlier $100 billion.
However, the currency has rebounded by almost 10.5% to Rs278/$ and has remained relatively stable over the past six-and-a-half months compared to the volatility observed between 2017 and 2023. The PSX has witnessed a remarkable rally since July 2023, reaching a new all-time high of over 67,200 points on Thursday from 40,000 points in June 2023, indicating a rising market capitalisation trend.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, JS Global Capital’s Head of Equity Sales, Syed Faran Rizvi, mentioned that global investors are highly optimistic about Pakistani equities, with many returning to Pakistan following the country’s attainment of political and economic stability post-February 2024 elections.
Global media reports highlighted FTSE Russell’s decision not to strip Egypt and Pakistan of their emerging-market status as a green light for passive stock funds to resume investing in these countries, which were recently at risk of defaulting on their debts.
The FTSE Russell decision follows a four-week period of positive news, including “Pakistan obtaining a stable government led by a reform-friendly prime minister and Egypt securing more than $57 billion in rescue packages—eliminating default threats and aiding their equities to outperform EM peers.”
Pakistan and Egypt have faced a dearth of foreign portfolio flows for about seven years. While they still have challenges to overcome in their economic crises, FTSE Russell’s decision offers them a potential lifeline.
Rizvi further stated that the downward trend in inflation readings and crucial energy reforms, including the discontinuation of gas pricing subsidies, are key developments that will boost economic activities in Pakistan significantly.
The decline in inflation readings is expected to prompt the central bank to make its first cut in the key interest rate, enabling businesses to resume bank borrowing and increase production. Rizvi highlighted banks and energy firms as major beneficiaries of ongoing economic reforms, suggesting investors consider stocks in these sectors along with others like fertilisers, food, and textiles.
He projected that the PSX would reach 70,000 points by the end of the current fiscal year on June 30, 2024, expressing confidence in the return of stability to the country’s economy over the next two to three years.
However, FTSE stated that if Pakistan fails to achieve the minimum investable market capitalisation and securities count exit level thresholds by the close on Friday, June 28, 2024, it would be demoted from secondary emerging to frontier market status, subject to final ratification by the FTSE Russell Index Governance Board. This potential action will coincide with the September 2024 index reviews, effective from the open on Monday, September 23, 2024. FTSE Russell plans to provide an update on Pakistan’s watch list status at the beginning of July 2024.

3,Rupee steady as forex reserves rise,"Gold hit over six-and-a-half-month high at Rs231,000 per tola","Pakistani currency on Thursday remained steady at over five-month high at Rs278.03 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market, maintaining its uptrend for the 11th successive working day amid a slight pickup in foreign exchange reserves at $8.02 billion.
Besides, gold hit over six-and-a-half-month high at Rs231,000 per tola (11.66 grams) in line with the surge in global markets.
According to SBP data, the rupee inched up Rs0.01 against the greenback, closing stable at Rs278.03/$.
The currency has cumulatively gained 10.45%, or Rs29.07, in the past over six and a half months compared to the record low close at Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023. Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan reported that the local currency increased 0.06%, or Rs0.19, on a day-on-day basis and closed at Rs280.41/$ in the open market. The rupee has maintained its uptrend in the wake of higher supply of foreign currency compared to its demand.The central bank is apparently absorbing the surplus supply of dollars, which has led to the rise in the foreign exchange reserves.

4,Govt plans to accelerate minerals mining,"Poised to establish new, dedicated Mines and Minerals Division","The government has planned to set up a new dedicated Mines and Minerals Division as part of efforts to accelerate mining activities to give a big push to Pakistan’s economy.
This is in line with the attempts made in the previous tenure of Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, which strived to establish the Mines and Minerals Division to ramp up efforts for the exploitation of minerals in the country.
Balochistan is rich in mineral resources where all-out efforts are being made to expedite mining activities after an out-of-court settlement with a foreign firm in relation to the Reko Diq copper and gold mining project. The chief of Barrick Gold, headquartered in Toronto, Canada, has been seen active over the past few days after Shehbaz Sharif took over as the prime minister.
He recently held a meeting with the prime minister in Lahore where the premier assured him of fool-proof security arrangements for kicking off mining under the Reko Diq project, officials say.
At present, Barrick Gold and Pakistani companies are making efforts to arrange funds for the project located in the Chagai area of Balochistan.
In this regard, Pakistan’s government has worked out a $1.9 billion funding plan. However, total project funding has been estimated at $4.297 billion.
Of this, the share of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will be $1.194 billion and that of Balochistan government SPV will be $717 million, according to the definitive agreements. The share of Balochistan will be funded by the federal government.
The Reko Diq project is being executed by a joint venture comprising Barrick Gold, the government of Balochistan and SOEs namely Pakistan Petroleum Limited, Oil and Gas Development Company and Government Holdings (Private) Limited.
At present, a feasibility study is underway that is likely to be completed by the end of this year. At the same time, relevant companies are trying to arrange foreign financing for the project. Saudi Arabia has also shown keen interest in becoming part of Reko Diq. Kuwait is another country from where Pakistan is seeking funds for minerals mining.
Pakistan and Kuwait have agreed to establish a $1 billion mining fund. Islamabad has designated a state-owned company as lead entity for engaging in cooperation with Kuwait. In this regard, the two sides have held initial deliberations and a Kuwaiti company is interested in the mining of metals and minerals used in renewable energy.
During the visit of the caretaker prime minister late last year, Pakistan and Kuwait signed a memorandum of understanding on investment cooperation in water supply projects for the development of mines in Chagai and surrounding areas.
The Petroleum Division has already set up a Minerals Cell while the government is working on revising the National Minerals Policy to stimulate foreign investment in the minerals-rich province of Balochistan. Among other measures being undertaken is potential amendments to the policy and rules to remove hurdles in the way of gold and copper mining and woo foreign investors.
Now, the government is going to set up a dedicated Mines and Minerals Division with the mandate to deal with all the issues facing the sector.
Work is also underway on the second draft of National Minerals Policy. In addition, the first draft for updating the Mines Act 1923 has already been prepared. Officials revealed that a gap analysis was being conducted to update the Provincial Minerals Concession Rules, which would be finalised in the coming months.

5,Stocks soar to record high on SOEs sell-off,"KSE-100 index advances 594.34 points, settles at 67,142.12","In another record-breaking rally, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday rose nearly 600 points and shot past the 67,000-point barrier to a new record high on the back of major positive developments.
The key triggers were the classification of Pakistan as a secondary emerging market in the FTSE Global Equity Indices and the fast-tracking of privatisation process for state-owned Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).
Earlier, trading began with investor optimism amid robust activity. Bulls dominated proceedings throughout the day as they cheered progress in the privatisation of PIA and other state-owned entities (SOEs).
Moreover, the FTSE classification was expected to result in increased foreign inflows due to a stable government, which gave boost to investor confidence. Resultantly, the KSE-100 index touched the intra-day high of 67,246.02 points. Market optimism was further fuelled by reform agenda and the potential new International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme. Power, banking and fertiliser sectors primarily contributed to the market’s strength.
The index, after shedding some points in the final hour, closed above the 67,000 mark.
“Stocks closed at an all-time high after FTSE maintained Pakistan equities’ secondary emerging market status, which is likely to lead to inflows of passive stock funds amid a stable government,” said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.
“Government deliberations on privatising the ailing SOEs amid approval of Rs268 billion worth of debt restructuring for PIA and rupee stability after the Pakistan-IMF staff-level agreement for the release of $1.1 billion tranche played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a surge of 594.34 points, or 0.89%, and settled at 67,142.12. Topline Securities, in its report, said that the KSE-100 index continued its upward trajectory.
“Optimism was fuelled by the reform agenda, alongside anticipation of a forthcoming IMF programme, fostering a favourable market outlook,” it said.
“SIFC (Special Investment Facilitation Council) remains steadfast in its commitment to reforms, notably through the privatisation of PIA and other state-owned entities. To drive this agenda forward, the SIFC is convening a three-day meeting with the newly constituted executive committee, under the leadership of PM Shehbaz.”
Investors strategically augmented their equity portfolios by acquiring blue-chip stocks across diverse sectors. Notably, power, banking and fertiliser sectors positively influenced the index, with Bank AL Habib, Engro Corporation, MCB Bank, Pakistan Petroleum and Lucky Cement collectively contributing 208 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its review, highlighted that the KSE-100 index saw “new all-time highs with gains through 67,000”.
FTSE retained Pakistan on the watch list as part of its March 2024 interim update, it said, adding that Pakistan would next be assessed against the minimum investible market capitalisation and securities’ exit level as of June 28, 2024.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala observed that the KSE-100 breached an all-time high as significant interest was seen in sectors like banking, cement and fertiliser. “Looking ahead, we advise investors to adopt a buy-on-dips approach, especially focusing on banking, E&P and fertiliser sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 421.1 million shares against Wednesday’s tally of 354.6 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs16.2 billion.
Shares of 352 companies were traded. Of these, 212 stocks closed higher, 111 dropped and 29 remained unchanged.
PTCL was the volume leader with trading in 55.7 million shares, gaining Rs1.11 to close at Rs18.42. It was followed by Lotte Chemical with 27.2 million shares, gaining Rs0.03 to close at Rs19.56 and Telecard Limited with 25.5 million shares, gaining Rs0.05 to close at Rs9.29. Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth Rs259.3 million, according to the NCCPL.

6,LNG diversion leads to gas price hike,"HR cost constitutes only 4% of total gas price, says SNGPL","Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) has emphasised that the cost of human resources accounts for only 4% of the total gas price, where 94% is the cost of gas and the remaining is the return on capital expenditure.
According to an SNGPL spokesperson, one of the key reasons behind the increase in gas prices is the continuous depletion of domestic gas resources, which has necessitated the diversion of re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) to domestic consumers, particularly during winter. The average cost of RLNG is about Rs3,500 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) while the average sale price for the domestic sector is around Rs1,100 per mmBtu.
This differential amounting to Rs231 billion has also necessitated the current price increase since the cost of RLNG diversion has to be recovered to keep the LNG supply chain functional, the spokesperson said.
The official added that the cost of indigenous gas had gone up by Rs69 billion as the Pakistani rupee devalued by 55% over the past two years and all gas purchase contracts were in US dollars as well as linked with crude and furnace oil prices. It must be pointed out that despite the recent increase in gas prices, the average rate for the protected class of domestic consumers is Rs513 per mmBtu, much lower than the cost price of Rs1,674.
Some 4.4 million consumers fall in the protected category in the SNGPL network, which constitute 60% of the total consumers. Their bills during the winter month of February remained less than Rs2,000 (inclusive of taxes).
Despite the tariff increase, a subsidy of Rs128 billion is projected to be provided to the domestic consumers of SNGPL during FY24, the spokesperson said. He highlighted that the gas business was highly regulated and governed under the Ogra Ordinance, 2002. To determine the revenue requirement of gas companies, Ogra has been holding public hearings since 2002.

7,Sindh farmers urge promotion of intercropping,"To boost agro-ecosystem, ensure food security in Sindh amid water shortage","Progressive growers and agriculture experts are advocating for promoting intercropping, one of the traditional farming systems, to boost the agro-ecosystem and ensure food security in Sindh, where there is a significant water shortage.
Intercropping, cultivating two or more crops simultaneously in the same field, is a traditional farming system that has been in use for a long time. However, it is not yet widely popular due to some vested interests of Zamidars (landlords).
This farming practice can help promote the agro-economy, ensure and enhance food security, particularly in the left-bank canal areas of the Sukkur Barrage, which cover full-fledged eight districts of Sindh. These eight districts, including Sukkur, Khairpur, Naushahro Feroze, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sanghar, Matiari, Tando Allahyar, and Mirpurkhas, possess highly fertile agricultural lands.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Sindh Chamber of Agriculture (SCA) Senior Vice President and progressive grower Nabi Bux Sathio said that intercropping is a beneficial cultivation practice that can help conserve water, reduce the cost of fertiliser, land preparation, and labour as farmers grow two or three crops simultaneously while using resources for one crop only.
Under this method, a farmer applies fertiliser, water, carries out land preparation, and uses labour for one crop, while another one or two crops do not require water, fertiliser, and other resources. He further stated that this farming system is suitable for the entire command areas of the left-bank canals of the Guddu Barrage, where the lands are fertile. However, growers have not been practicing this system lately, focusing mainly on high delta crops where intercropping cannot be applied due to vested interests.
Experts and academicians from Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) mentioned that both SAU and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) have initiated a project titled “Transforming Indus Basin with Climate-Resilient Agriculture and Water Management.” This project aims to provide training to small growers on intercropping to enhance economic prosperity in rural areas.
“We are promoting intercropping of sugarcane and wheat in the first phase and will apply this growing method to cotton and rice in the second phase,” said SAU Department of Soil Sciences Professor Dr Ghulam Murtaza Jamro. “We have identified 22 farmers’ demonstration plots or sites in three districts of the province, including nine in Badin, nine in Sanghar, and four in Umerkot. We have trained a total of 660 farmers who are direct beneficiaries on these 22 sites, with 30 growers on each site.”
The FAO covers the cost of land preparation, seeds, fertiliser, and training expenses, while SAU provides expertise and training to farmers. Local farmers in these three districts have received seeds, fertiliser, and the cost of land preparation, with farmer field schools set up. As part of the project, one acre of land owned by farmers on 22 sites in three districts has been selected, with growers expecting output.
SAU Faculty of Crop Protection Department of Plant Pathology Professor M Mithal Jiskani mentioned that trained farmers reported better returns and increased satisfaction with this agricultural technique.

8,Global M&A picks up in Q1,"Volumes surge in US by 59%, Europe by 64%, slump 40% in Asia-Pacific","Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) bounced back in the first quarter after a downbeat 2023, thanks to the return of mega deals, cheering investment bankers and lawyers waiting for a pick-up.
Total M&A volumes globally climbed 30% to about $755.1 billion, according to the most recent data from Dealogic. The number of transactions worth more than $10 billion jumped to 14, compared with five during the same period last year.
Investment bankers said boardroom confidence for dealmaking has improved on the back of strong earnings, potential interest rate cuts this year, and an ebullient market. “When you see larger deals happening, it’s a much more direct sign of the returning health of the market, because boards and CEOs, due to the nature of large deals, are going to be more conservative when they approach them,” said Blair Effron, co-founder of investment bank Centerview Partners. “We do think that the activity that we see today is heading in the right direction.”
US M&A volumes surged 59% to $431.8 billion. European deals jumped 64%, while Asia Pacific volumes slumped 40%. Dealmakers said a potential market recovery, following the successful debuts of Astera Labs and Reddit, could provide a boost to the pipeline.
Leveraged buyout volumes, which slumped last year due to a spike in financing costs, declined 7% to $91 billion.
“We’re still waiting for the private equity work to really pick up - that’s still the missing ingredient,” said Krishna Veeraraghavan, global co-head of the M&A group at law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. “You still are seeing a mismatch between what sellers expect their assets to transact for and what buyers are willing to pay based on where rates are right now.”

9,Tax exemptions of Rs50b defy IMF,"PCAA, PAA exempted via Acts of parliament approved weeks after IMF-SBA","Pakistan has granted a Rs50 billion annual income tax exemption to two government departments, violating the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and its own tax law. This decision faced resistance from tax authorities despite being approved through two Acts of Parliament.
Official documents show that the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCCA) and Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) were granted income tax exemptions through two Acts of Parliament weeks after the approval of the $3 billion Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).
The annual cost of the income tax exemption for this fiscal year alone is Rs50 billion, as per the documents. Sources reveal that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) made efforts to stop the tax exemption but encountered resistance from the Ministry of Law and Justice and other concerned authorities. These exemptions were not granted under the Income Tax Ordinance of 2001, violating section 54 of the Ordinance.
The Ministry of Law has supported the Civil Aviation Authority’s contention for the Rs50 billion income tax exemption.
The parliament approved two new laws, the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority Act, 2023, and the Pakistan Airport Authority Act, 2023, in August last year, weeks after the IMF Executive Board approved the $3 billion bailout package. Pakistan cannot grant any income tax exemption until it is discussed and approved by the IMF.
Sources mention that the FBR and the Ministry of Finance were not in favour of the income tax exemption, with the FBR attempting to recover the amount from the Civil Aviation Authority.
The IMF board is scheduled to meet late next month to approve the staff level agreement and release the remaining loan amount of $1.1 billion. The government is also in the process of seeking yet another bailout package.
Documents indicate that the FBR believed the exemption was not available to both authorities as it was not provided under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. Section 54 bars any such exemption to any entity provided under any other law.
Section 3 of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority Act, 2023, provides that the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority established under the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority Ordinance, 1982, shall be deemed the authority established for the purposes of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority Act, 2023.
According to the Pakistan Civil Aviation Act 2023, “notwithstanding anything contained in the Income Tax Act, 2001, or any other law relating to income tax, super tax, sales tax on services, or property tax, the authority shall be exempted from paying any such tax on its income, services, profits, gains, or property.”
According to the Airports Act, “notwithstanding anything contained in the Income Tax Act, 2001, or any other law relating to income tax, super tax, sales tax on services, or property tax, the Authority shall be exempted from paying any such tax on its income services, profits, gains, or property.”
The Ministry of Law and Justice has backed the CAA’s claim for Rs50 billion income tax exemption.
This issue is a classic case of competing non-obstante clauses; two conflicting sets of legislation need to be interpreted in a purposive manner, and all efforts must be made to harmonise and reconcile two conflicting enactments. If the above is impossible to achieve, a non-obstante clause becomes effective, according to the Law Ministry opinion.
“In the opinion of this Division, the intent of the legislature as envisaged in section 34 of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Act, 2023, and section 38 of the Pakistan Airports Authority Act, 2023, is too clear to ignore,” according to the Law Ministry’s written opinion.
It adds that the legislature has categorically ousted the operation of the Income Tax Ordinance positively by naming its own former enactment and then restricting its operation in regards to the two special laws mentioned above.
“Henceforth, it is the opinion of this (Law) Division that the non-obstante clauses as provided in sections 34 and 38 of the PCA and PAA 2023 would, in light of the Judicial Pronouncement quoted above, by virtue of being enacted latter in time, override the provisions of section 54 of the ITO Ordinance, 2001.”
However, the FBR has not accepted the Law Ministry’s opinion. The tax authorities are facing an uphill task to collect Rs879 billion from the taxpayers in the month of March. The State Bank of Pakistan has instructed the commercial banks to keep their branches open beyond scheduled timing to facilitate tax payments.
The FBR is of the view that it differs with the Ministry of Law and Justice on the grounds that the Income Tax Ordinance is the “only special law” dealing with taxation. Therefore, for the purposes of taxation, neither the Pakistan Civil Aviation Act, 2023, nor the Pakistan Airport Authority Act, 2023, are special laws, it added.
