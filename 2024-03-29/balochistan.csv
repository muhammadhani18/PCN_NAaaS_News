5,Online shopping gains pace as Eid draws closer,Consumer Protection Council cautions about associated risks,"The trend of online Eid shopping is on the rise in Rawalpindi, with people of all ages turning to various platforms for quality goods at affordable prices, especially amid concerns about crowded markets and the quality of items like clothes and shoes.
Citizens have embraced online shopping for Eid, a trend that has been steadily growing over recent years. Major brands have responded by offering free home delivery and other conveniences, catering to the increasing number of shoppers opting to stay away from traditional markets.
While this shift has delighted consumers, it has also raised concerns among small business owners who are feeling the impact of reduced foot traffic.
In Rawalpindi, particularly in areas like Moti Bazaar and Bank Road, which are renowned for their bustling markets during Eid, the scene has noticeably changed. Tahir Taj Bhatti, a prominent merchant from Moti Bazaar, acknowledged the shift towards online shopping. He highlighted the convenience it offers, allowing buyers to browse and purchase a wide variety of items from the comfort of their homes. This convenience has become especially significant during the ongoing pandemic and the fasting month of Ramazan, where people prefer to avoid crowded places.
However, this shift has not been without consequences for local businesses. Zafar Qadri, a business leader from Bank Road, lamented how discounts and promotions from big brands have adversely impacted small traders.
The allure of freebies and discounts online has diverted customers away from physical markets, affecting the livelihoods of small-scale entrepreneurs. Muhammad Usman, a regular online shopper, pointed out that the younger generation is particularly inclined towards online shopping, posing challenges for traditional businesses that rely on foot traffic.
The Consumer Protection Council of Rawalpindi has cautioned consumers about the risks associated with online shopping during Eid.
While it offers convenience and cost savings, there are risks of fraud and substandard products. Consumers are advised to choose reputable platforms, conduct research before making purchases, and avoid sharing sensitive information online to ensure a pleasant Eid shopping experience.
Overall, the trend of online Eid shopping reflects the evolving consumer habits in Rawalpindi, presenting both opportunities and challenges for businesses and consumers alike. As technology continues to reshape the retail landscape, finding a balance between online convenience and supporting local businesses remains a key consideration for the community.

7,Rawat police witness major reshuffle,Pindi SSP Ops dispels impression of political interference,"Rawalpindi SSP Operations Hafiz Kamran Asghar has transferred 68 cops from Rawat police station and its adjacent police chowkis and check posts and replaced them with new appointments.
The officials including Sub Inspectors (SIs), Assistant Sub Inspectors (ASIs), Head Constables and Constables remained posted at Rawat police stations, Industrial Area police Chowki and others for six months or more.
Some cops who managed their reappointments at the same places despite completing their time duration have also been transferred in a sudden move.
Numerous social media reports became viral about a local MPA of Gujar Khan that on his intervention the Punjab police chief changed the entire staff of the Rawat police station.

SSP Asghar said that the policemen, who had been stationed at the Rawat police station and its adjacent check posts for six months or longer or for the second and third time, had been transferred.

8,Two women raped in separate incidents in Islamabad,Robbers continue to loot citizens with impunity in federal capital,"At least two women were sexually assaulted in Islamabad in separate incidents, raising concerns about women’s safety in the federal capital.

9,Concerns rise over antenna wire mandate for bikers,Citizens’ dismayed over authorities’ bizarre approach to combat kite flying hazards,"Despite persistent challenges in curbing the smuggling and use of hazardous metal and chemical strings for kite flying, the Punjab government along with the police has introduced an unconventional solution to safeguard motorcyclists from stray strings.
Under the new initiative, motorcyclists are required to not only wear helmets but also install long antenna wires on their bikes to fend off dangerous kite strings. However, this measure has sparked worries among citizens, as many are being compelled to remove rear-view mirrors to accommodate antennas, posing significant traffic risks.
Despite a blanket ban on kite flying and the use of metal and chemical strings across the province, including Rawalpindi, these regulations are often flouted, particularly during the Basant festival. Moreover, despite efforts to curb smuggling from other regions, kite-flying incidents persist, resulting in injuries and fatalities.
Similarly, the smuggling and delivery of locally produced material from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and other areas is also going on. This year too, kite flying was done openly throughout the province during which many cases of deaths and injuries came to light because of string running over the necks and incidents of falling from the roofs.
While the installation of antennas on motorcycles aims to protect riders from lethal strings, it has not addressed the root issue of enforcing kite-flying bans and controlling the circulation of dangerous materials. Concerns have been raised regarding the proper implementation of these measures and their impact on road safety.
In Rawalpindi, antennas were installed on the highways by stopping motorcyclists, however, during this exercise, such antennas are often installed in the places reserved for the rear-view mirrors, while the lack of back-view mirrors on motorcycles also increases the risk of accidents.
Motorcyclists interviewed expressed frustration over the government’s inability to address the underlying problems and highlighted the burden placed on them to mitigate risks independently.
Citizens have called upon Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to prioritise stringent legislation against kite flying instead of imposing makeshift solutions like antenna installation.
Meanwhile, authorities emphasise the importance of adhering to existing regulations, with Muhammad Raza Rawalpindi, Motor Vehicle Examiner, advocating for the judicious placement of flexible antenna wires on motorcycles. However, some experts argue that the ultimate solution lies in comprehensive legislation at the national level, coupled with stricter penalties for kite-related offences.
Former Chief Traffic Officer, SSP Syed Ishtiaq Shah, warns against the potential hazards posed by antenna wires and underscores the necessity of addressing the issue at its source for a lasting resolution.
“This is not a solution, if the government is serious about making the lives of the citizens safe, it should legislate from the central level and increase the penalties by banning the manufacture and possession of kites and strings across the country,” Shah said. “This is the only way to overcome this problem and all other measures will be temporary,” he added.
