0,"PM picks Dar over Aurangzeb, again",President Zardari reconstitutes CCI by excluding financial czar from it on PM's advice,"In the latest display of internal discord within the Sharif dynasty, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has picked Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar over Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb as President Asif Ali Zardari has reconstituted the Council of Common Interest (CCI) by excluding financial czar from it on premier’s advice.
Knowing that no constitutional body is considered complete without the finance minister, the prime minister has still excluded Aurangzeb from the CCI and included Dar just days after he carved out a major role for the foreign minister while reconstituting several financial committees.
A week ago, the premier had clipped the finance minister’s decision-making wings when he deprived him of the chairmanship of the most important Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet but only to reverse his decision in no time.
It seems PM Shehbaz has been facing difficulties in constituting different committees since the formation of the government as he has been unable to exclude Dar – a close family member, key party leader and one who repeatedly served as finance minister during PML-N’s tenures – even from the committees that have less to do with the foreign minister and more with the finance minister.
For instance, the foreign minister was made the chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCOP) – a position previously held by the finance minister before the Pakistan Democratic Movement government – which was later transferred to Privatisation Minister Fawad Hasan Fawad.
Privately, the PML-N officials also admit that the tussle regarding the appointment of a new finance minister in place of Dar started when the party decided to form government in the Center. Though Dar was ultimately not made the finance minister, they said, it was still difficult to keep him limited to matters pertaining to foreign affairs.
“You can take Dar out of finance ministry but you can never take finance ministry out of Dar,” a PML-N lawmaker quipped while commenting on the situation, saying the inclusion of foreign minister in committees dealing with financial affairs shows a glimpse of it.

According to the notification issued on March 25, President Zardari while exercising the powers conferred under Article 153 of the Constitution, “the President on the advice of the Prime Minister, has constituted the Council of Common Interests, with effect from 21st March 2024”.
As per the notification, the Prime Minister is the chairman while the chief ministers of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh are its members. Apart from the PM and four provincial chiefs, Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Minister for States & Frontier Regions (SAFRON), Engr. Amir Muqamisre a members of CCI.
The previous notification issued on January 9 this year shows that the interim finance minister was a member of CCI. However, the new notification doesn’t include the incumbent financial czar in CCI, indicating that the tussle has deepened in the House of Sharifs as well as in the power corridors when it comes to the composition of new committees.
Article 154(1) of the Constitution states that “The Council shall formulate and regulate concerning matters in Part II of the Federal Legislative List and shall exercise supervision and control over related institutions.”
Article 154 (3) provides that the Council shall have a permanent Secretariat and shall meet at least once in ninety days. Article 155 of the Constitution extends the purview of CCI on the resolution of a dispute between the federation and the federating units or area’s governments regarding their rights to water from any natural source and authorizes the federal or provincial government concerned to make a complaint to CCI.
It says that the CCI can either decide or recommend the President to set up a Commission consisting of persons having knowledge and experience in irrigation, engineering, administration, finance and law under the Pakistan Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1956.
As regards “Electricity”, Article 157 while authorising the federal government to construct a hydro-electric or thermal power installation in any province in consultation with that province also authorizes the provincial governments to draw bulk supply from the national grid for transmission and distribution within the province, levy taxes on consumption, construct power houses and grid stations and lay transmission lines and also to determine electricity tariff within the province.
In case of any dispute in the matter, the federal or provincial government can approach the CCI for resolution of the dispute.
Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar was approached for comments on why the finance minister has been excluded and the foreign minister included in CCI and if there was a specific reason for it.
However, his comments didn’t come till the filing of the story.

2,PTI targets top justices amid letter turmoil,"Lawyers demand resignations of CJP Isa, IHC CJ Aamir Farooq","In a significant turn of events, the legal team of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) escalated their demands on Friday, calling for the resignations of Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq. Their demands come in the wake of a damning letter penned by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), alleging interference in judicial affairs.
Addressing the media at a press conference, PTI representatives Raoof Hasan, Naeem Haider Panjutha, Shoaib Shaheen, Ali Bukhari, and Niazullah Niazi underscored the paralysis gripping the country's legal system. Acting upon directives from PTI founder Imran Khan, they vowed to launch a nationwide movement to address these concerns.
Hasan emphasized the gravity of the judges' letter, labeling it a ""very serious issue."" He pointed out the letter's reference to Chief Justice Isa's inaction regarding the judges' grievances.

Pointing to allegations made in the letter, he said that installing cameras in people’s bedrooms was a “murder of justice and law”. He also opposed the inquiry by a retired judge over the letter, asking how the accused [executive] could be the judge in its own case.
“Will the prime minister himself decide whether he is guilty or not,” he posed a question, while referring to the inquiry commission headed by a retired judge, as announced by the government on Thursday. “We will not let this mockery happen.”

Panjotha said that a 26-hour operation was conducted at Imran’s house but the chief justice remained silent. Similarly, on March 28, last year, there was an attack on the PTI workers at the judicial complex but the blame was unfairly placed on party workers.
“The [conviction of Imran in the] Toshakhana case was decided through WhatsApp message. The Cypher case trial [against Imran] was ended within four weeks. What happened to our application for level-playing field [in the elections]? Chief Justice Isa even snatched our [electoral] bat symbol,” he charged.
Niazi echoed these sentiments, asserting that the judges' letter underscored systemic dysfunction within the country. Despite the letter's direct address to Chief Justice Isa, Niazi lamented the absence of any consequential action. He accused the country of descending into a state of lawlessness, emphasizing the urgent need for accountability.
Demanding immediate resignations from Chief Justice Isa and Chief Justice Farooq, Niazi declared that the time for mere press conferences had passed. He announced plans for a widespread movement, pledging to petition both the Supreme Court and the high court. Niazi reiterated Imran Khan's call for nationwide protests, signaling a decisive shift towards direct action.

3,"Centre, provinces agree on DISCOs restructuring","PM vows zero tolerance against smuggling, corruption","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday chaired a meeting on the measures against a spectrum of illegal activities.
Members of the federal cabinet, Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir, provincial chief ministers and high-level government officials were present in the meeting.
The agenda of the meeting was “measures against spectrum of illegal activities and criminal mafias”. The participants were briefed in detail on the steps taken against criminal mafias, smuggling, hoarding, money laundering, power theft and repatriation of illegal foreigners etc.
The participants acknowledged the importance of such actions and their positive impact on the economy and wellbeing of the people of Pakistan.
The meeting showed firm resolve to take action against smugglers, hoarders and market manipulators, who have impacted the economic trajectory and to provide immediate relief to common citizens.
The meeting approved agreements among federal and provincial governments on anti-power theft policy, restructuring of power distribution companies on modern lines, installation of smart meters for full eradication of power theft and ordered strict action against corrupt officers.
The army chief assured unwavering resolve of Pakistan Army to support the government’s initiatives aimed at economic recovery of the country.
At the end, the prime minister directed all stakeholders to vigorously pursue various initiatives against spectrum of illegal activities and criminal mafias to ensure their accomplishment within stipulated the timeframe.
The prime minister said the government would not allow any political or bureaucratic interference in its move to curb smuggling, corruption, power theft and tax evasion in the country.

“No political and bureaucratic influence will be allowed to interfere in this major surgery which we have to undertake collectively for the good of Pakistan and its 250 million people,” the prime minister said while chairing a meeting on anti-smuggling.
He said it was very important to understand the real challenges of the country and then immediately fix them to revive and stabilize the economy.
For this, he said all stakeholders including the provinces, institutions, and armed forces will have to collaborate with the federal government to tackle one of the most important challenge of revival of economy.
The prime minister said illegal trade and smuggling were the biggest challenges that had badly dented the country’s economy.
He recalled that in 2022, the coalition government allowed export of 250,000 tons of sugar, but it had to withdraw its decision “because we were told that the surplus target was not up to that level”. However, he said the same amount of sugar was later exported to Afghanistan.
Similarly, the prime minister pointed out that the country had to face loss of around Rs 400 to 500 billion annually in term of power theft, whereas leakages, transmission losses and line losses of electricity were other than that.
As regards tax revenues, he said the government’s target this year was Rs 9 trillion. But it has the potential of collecting Rs 4 trillion extra revenues by streamlining the tax system and by curbing corruption and tax evasion.
He said a tax amount of Rs 2.7 trillion was still under litigation either in tribunals or in appellant courts. The government, he said would try its best to recover this amount.
Appreciating the efforts of the army chief in curbing smuggling and power theft, the prime minister said during the nine months of interim government, an amount of Rs58 billion was saved in the power sector.
Similarly, a significant improvement was witnessed in curbing smuggling in the country due to the commitment, will to do, and cooperation of all provinces, and the personal commitment and interest of the chief of army staff, the prime minister added.
Besides initiating reforms in certain sectors, he said the government was also committed to promote industry and agriculture sector in the country.
He informed that the government had chalked out a plan to fully digitize the system of Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to boost the tax revenues in the country.
He said the well reputed and honest officers will be encouraged while the corrupt element will be discouraged.
As regards law and order situation, the prime minister said the government was determined to foil the evil designs of the enemy.

4,Biden reaches out to Pakistani premier,"In first official letter to Shehbaz, US president signals engagement","US President Joe Biden on Friday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, saying Washington will continue to stand with Pakistan to tackle the most “pressing global and regional challenges.”
This marked Biden's first official correspondence with any Pakistani premier in years.
Breaking from tradition, President Biden departed from his predecessors' ritual of engaging with Pakistani leaders during his tenure. Neither did he reach out to former prime minister Imran Khan after his election victory, nor did he communicate with Shehbaz upon his succession in April 2022.
According to the contents of the letter shared by the US Embassy here, President Biden wrote: “The enduring partnership between our nations remains critical to ensuring the security of our people—and people around the world—and the United States will continue to stand with Pakistan to tackle the most pressing global and regional challenges of our time.”
“That includes advancing our shared vision for a future of greater health security, economic growth, and access to education for all. Through our U.S.-Pakistan “Green Alliance” framework, we will also continue to strengthen our climate resilience, support sustainable agriculture and water management, and assist with Pakistan’s recovery from the devastating floods in 2022,” Biden said.

“And, the United States remains committed to working with Pakistan to protect human rights and promote progress,” he added.
“Together, we will continue to forge a strong partnership between our nations, and close bond between our people,” he concluded.
Biden’s letter suggested that despite allegations of ballot fraud, the US government is ready to work with the new government.
Although Pakistan is no longer a priority for the US after its withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, the South Asian nation remains key in terms of regional security and counter-terrorism efforts.
While the American civilian leaders have had an indifferent attitude towards Pakistan in recent years, the American military establishment still wants a working relationship with Pakistan.
In some of the recent testimonies before the US Senate committees, US CENTCOM chief Michael Kurilla stressed the importance of Pakistan and said the US must see ties with Islamabad on its own merit.

5,Economy slows down to 1% in Q2,NAC says only farm sector does well with 5% growth," 
Pakistan’s economic growth rate has slowed down to just 1% in the second quarter of this fiscal year because of the poor performance of the industrial and services sectors, emphasising the negative impacts of the prolonged contraction policies that have also caused high unemployment.
Just two days before leaving her office, former caretaker finance minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar had boasted that the economic growth rate would be around 3% during the second quarter of the ongoing fiscal year on the back of a “stronger manufacturing output” -- a claim that was far from reality.
The only silver lining during this fiscal year is the agricultural sector, which is constantly showing growth amid the increased focus of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).
The overall economic growth rate during the second quarter (October-December) of the current fiscal year remained at 1%, according to the National Accounts Committee (NAC).
The government body responsible for finalising the national accounts noted that the industrial sector contracted 0.84% during the second quarter against the same period a year ago -- contrary to Dr Akhtar’s assertion.
The services sector was almost flat at 0.01% growth.
However, the agricultural sector posted a growth rate of over 5% during the first quarter.
According to the SIFC Secretariat, the Green Corporate Livestock Initiative (GCLI) has inked a deal with a Brazilian company to import nine breeds of cattle from its country to enhance yield and productivity.
These breeds, including both local and Brazilian varieties, will improve Pakistan's livestock sector.
The consignment of 173 cattle arrived at Sialkot International Airport on Thursday, marking an important milestone in bilateral trade relations between Brazil and Pakistan.
The 108th meeting of the NAC held in Islamabad also revised upward the growth estimates for the first quarter of this fiscal year from 2.1% to 2.5%.
Planning Secretary Awais Manzur Sumra chaired the NAC huddle.
Pakistan’s population is increasing at a pace of 2.6% annually and any growth rate below this means that the country saw a surge in poverty, unemployment, and malnourishment.
For the current fiscal year, the government has set a 3.5% growth target but the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised downwards its projection to 2% because of the prevailing financial crisis in the country.
Pakistan has been under the IMF programme for a long period and is implementing tight fiscal and monetary policies.
The growing inflation has also taken a heavy toll on the businesses as well as the people, limiting their ability to purchase goods.
The government has been suffocating industrial growth by placing curbs on imports that led to the shortage of raw materials and consequential closure of factories.
New Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said this week that the country could still grow under the IMF programme by focusing on the agricultural sector.
However, he added that it had become impossible to conduct business in the country with the interest rate standing at 22%.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has kept the interest rate unchanged at a record 22% in the hope of containing inflation but it failed to do so.
In the process, the central bank massively increased the cost of debt servicing for the government and contributed to the high unemployment in the country.
Agriculture
The second quarter economic growth rate is pulled up by the farm sector. This sector is estimated to have grown over 5% in the second quarter on the back of a healthy output in major crops; cotton and ginning, and livestock.
The NAC observed that there was a healthy growth in crops, particularly the important ones.
Major crops have shown a growth of 8.12% in the second quarter because of a significant increase in the final production of cotton, rice, and maize.
Wheat, which had no impact in the first quarter, has shown an increase of 6.7% in comparison with last year, having a positive impact on the estimates of the second one, according to the NAC.
Sugarcane has posted a negative growth of -10.7% during 2023-24 but its impact has been offset by the upsurge in the remaining four crops.
Other crops have shown a slightly negative growth of -0.31% because of a -0.72% decline in the production of green fodder.
However, cotton ginning and their miscellaneous components, which had a very high negative growth because of the low production in 2022-23, has now witnessed double digit growth of 53.6% because of a healthy production of the crop in 2023-24.
Livestock is at the same level, while forestry and fishing have also retained their normal growth.
Industry
The sector of industry in the second quarter has again posted a negative growth.
There was a negative growth of -4.17% in the mining and quarrying industry because of the decrease in the production of gas (- 5%), marble (-40.13%, and limestone (-20%).
Large-scale manufacturing witnessed a nominal growth of 0.5% during the second quarter.
Small scale and slaughtering have witnessed a growth of 10.4%. Electricity, gas and water supply industry has shown a positive growth of 1.54% because of the increase in the output of independent power producers (IPPs) as well as hydropower and nuclear plants.
The construction industry contracted 17.6% in the second quarter because of a decline in the production of cement, iron and steel.
Services
According to the NAC, the services sector has shown a nominal growth of 0.01% in the second quarter of this fiscal year.
An analysis of the sector reflects a mixed trend.
Wholesale and retail trade has witnessed a growth of 2.1% because of a positive growth in the agricultural output and large-scale manufacturing.
Although there was a decline in imports, the negative impact was offset because of an increase in the output of agricultural and large-scale manufacturing.
Transport and storage increased by 1.1% because of the increase in the output of railways as well as road network.
High inflation has been the real cause of decline in growth for the sectors compiled on current prices and then deflated to constant rates, according to the NAC.
Information and communication is one of those sectors, which have been affected by the rising inflation.
The finance and insurance sector declined by -11%.
Public administration and social security, which is commonly termed as general government, has declined by -16.2% because of high deflators  against the same period last year.
The growth in the education sector slumped by nearly 1% in the second quarter. The NAC stated that the decline was because of an increase in deflators
Similarly, the human health and social work sector posted a decline of-2.5% because of an increase in deflators.
Other private services have been estimated at 3.63% on the basis of the indicators received from sources.
