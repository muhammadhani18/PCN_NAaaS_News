Additionally, the forum also recognized the importance of innovative financing mechanisms to attract foreign and private investment in skill education.
The consensus reached during the meeting underscored a shared commitment to tackling the alarming issue head-on.
Recognizing the unique challenges faced by Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), it was agreed that the federal ministry of education, with support from SIFC, would work separately to improve educational financing for these regions.
It was also agreed that the national skill voucher scheme will be piloted to provide greater access to skill development opportunities.
The minister of education maintained the necessity for high-impact IT training to equip students with relevant skills for the future job market. It was agreed to recommend to the apex committee to direct all governments to enhance financing in education.
The meeting declared that the SIFC forum will be a permanent forum, and that the progress will be reviewed in a monthly meeting.
Earlier this month on March 20, Chairman of the Character Education Foundation (CEF) Mehmood Ahmed was invited to the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training (M/o FE&PT) in Islamabad under the directives of PM Shehbaz to underscore the necessity for a comprehensive strategy to implement character education effectively.
The PM had reaffirmed the federal government's commitment to supporting high-achieving students through scholarship schemes for pursuing higher education at globally renowned institutions.

5,ECP links Senate polls with K-P MPAs’ oath,Orders speaker to swear in reserved seat lawmakers," 
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday linked the Senate elections to the extent of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa with the oath-taking of its MPAs allocated reserved seats, warning that it would be compelled to delay the polls in the province until they were sworn in.
The ECP’s directives have come on the heels of the Peshawar High Court’s verdict through which it ordered the administration of oath to the newly notified members of the K-P Assembly on the reserved seats for women and minorities belonging to the opposition parties.
Both the decisions have come as the K-P Assembly speaker was apparently delaying the administration of oath to the new members to prevent them from voting for the opposition candidates in the Senate elections scheduled for April 2.
The issue had arisen from the allocation of the reserved seats to the opposition parties instead of the ruling Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) -- a small party in which the PTI-backed independent members found refuge.
The SIC maintained that those reserved seats were its right as per its strength in the assembly.
However, the ECP had declined to allocate the reserved seats to the SIC because it had neither applied for them, nor provided its priority list to the commission before the February 8 general polls – a mandatory requirement under the election laws.
The PHC also upheld the ECP’s decision.
On Thursday, a five-member bench of the commission, while referring to the order of the PHC and in exercise of its powers under Article 218(3) of the Constitution [read with Section 4(1) and Section 8(c)] of the ECP Act of 2017, ruled that the electoral body would be forced to postpone the Senate polls to the extent of the K-P Assembly if its members were deprived from being sworn in.
In the order, the ECP directed that in case of the K-P Assembly speaker’s failure to comply with the directions of the PHC, the commission would be “constrained to postpone the ensuing Senate elections” and “extend the time for completion: of the polls in the upper house of parliament “to the extent of” the province in terms of Section 128 of the Election Act, 2017 as well as amend the notification issued under its Section20T till the administration of oath to the MPAs.
The bench, headed by ECP Chairman Sikandar Sultan Raja, and including Nisar Ahmed Durrani, Shah Mohammad Jatoi, Babar Hassan Bharwana, and Justice (retd) Ikramullah Khan gave the order on the applications of six petitioners in connection with the oath-taking on the reserved seats of the K-P Assembly and postponement of the Senate elections.
MPAs-elect Jamila Paracha, Afshan Hussain, Amna Sardar, Faiza Malik, Shazia Jadoon, and Suresh Kumar, who attended the proceedings, argued that they were being denied the opportunity to take oath as K-P MPAs.
The petitioners submitted applications seeking directions of the ECP to the concerned authorities to make arrangements for the administration of oath to them.
The applicants also prayed that until the administration of oath to them, the upcoming Senate elections to the extent of K-P should be suspended.
During the hearing, the K-P Assembly secretary appeared before the bench and said the meeting of the provincial legislature would be convened in accordance with its Rules of the Business.
He added that the speaker had not refused to administer oath to the applicants.
However, the ECP noted in the order that according to applicants, they approached the K-P Assembly speaker for convening a session of the legislature to administer oath to them but he refused to do so.
The commission ruled that voting was a fundamental right and nobody could be deprived of it.
 “The commission has ample power to issue such directions and make such consequential orders to ensure that election is conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law,” it added.
The ECP bench also ruled that Section 128 of the Elections Act empowered the commission to extend the time for the completion of the Senate elections -- for reasons which it considered sufficient -- by making necessary amendments to the notification issued under Section 107 of the polls law.

6,Imran’s lawyer highlight flaws in cypher verdict,"Claims that former PM, FM put behind bar on instruction of some US officials"," 
While pointing out loopholes in a trial court’s verdict, the lawyer representing former prime minister Imran Khan contended on Thursday that Imran and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi were sentenced in the diplomatic cipher case simply to appease a foreign power.
A division bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, resumed hearing the appeals of the PTI leaders against their conviction under the Official Secrets Act, 1923, for misusing a diplomatic cipher to the detriment of national interests.
Just two weeks before the ouster of the PTI government through a vote of no-confidence, Imran had brandished a piece of paper—allegedly a copy of a diplomatic cipher—at a public rally in Islamabad, claiming it as proof of a conspiracy against his government by a foreign power.
During the last PML-N-led government, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) registered a case against Imran and Qureshi for misusing the cipher copy. A special court convicted the PTI leaders on January 30 in the case, sentencing both to ten years in prison.
Read Cipher case trial termed ‘unfair’
On Thursday, when Justice Farooq asked Salman Safdar, the lawyer of Imran and Qureshi, about what Imran had actually waved in a public rally in March 2022, the lawyer said it was the job of the prosecution—the FIA—to establish what was in Imran’s hand during that rally.
Continuing his arguments, Safdar said Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, Asad Majeed, had dispatched the cipher after a meeting with US diplomat Donald Lu.
“In his testimony before the trial court, he did not disclose what prompted him to send the cipher telegram after that meeting. However, he clarified that he never mentioned any conspiracy in his message.”
When Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb asked Safdar if Majeed was one of the prosecution witnesses who were aware of the content of the cipher, the lawyer replied in the affirmative.
He said Majeed had recommended in a National Security Committee (NSC) meeting to issue a strong demarche on Donald Lu's statement, adding that the former PM had not violated his oath by revealing the threat issued by Lu.
Safdar said the trial court neither summoned the former US charge d’affaires, Angela Aggeler, nor asked for the record of her WhatsApp conversations with another Pakistani official.
“Apparently, a former PM has been put behind bars on the instruction of former US charge d’affaires and Lu,” he said.
Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb asked if a PM can be imprisoned, say just for laying stress on completing the Iran-Pakistan Gas Pipeline project. “At least you will need an FIR to do that,” he added.
The court noted that Asad Majeed could be the star witness of the prosecution. However, he did not reveal anything to qualify to become such a witness. The court later adjourned till Tuesday.
