7,Court orders JIT session for missing boy’s recovery,Expresses dismay over an agency picking up a 14-year-old hospital worker,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) expressed strong disapproval of the enforced disappearance of a 14-year-old boy by an agency.
Leading a two-member bench of the Sindh High Court, Justice Naimatullah Phulphoto inquired if the 14-year-old Ataullah had any criminal record, to which the investigation officer said no.
The SHC directed the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) and Public Task Force (PTF) to convene sessions, while also instructing the DIG to fully cooperate in the proceedings regarding the petition concerning the recovery of Ataullah.
Appearing before the bench on Thursday, the petitioner's counsel argued that Ataullah worked as a maintenance worker at Liaquat National Hospital. He was returning from home from work when an agency picked him up from the hospital gate. The court inquired with the investigating officer (IO) about the measures taken to locate the missing individual. The IO answered that 18 Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) had been held, ultimately uncovering the enforced disappearance of the boy in the previous JIT.
The court voiced strong disapproval and questioned how a 14-year-old boy could be forcibly disappeared. What did he do? Does the JIT Head write blindly? The court inquired about the child's criminal history. The IO confirmed that he has no criminal record and also informed that letters have been sent to various agencies to retrieve the boy.
The court ordered for JITs and PTF sessions to be convened while directing the DIG to collaborate in the proceedings and postponed the hearing until April 6.
Child possession
The Sindh High Court has allowed the custody of five-year-old Shawaiz and his 18-month-old brother Shah Meera to their mother.
The boys will be in the care of their paternal grandparents from Friday to Sunday, and with their mother from Sunday to Thursday.
Saqib, the father of the children, had passed away in November 2022. Following his death, Shawaiz stayed with his grandparents, who subsequently enrolled Shawaiz at a private school in Sanghar. The court mandated that the child be transferred to the branch of the same school in Karachi. The paternal grandparents will cover the monthly expenses of both the children, amounting to Rs60,000. Upon handing over Shawaiz to his mother, the child cried and clung to the grandmother in court.
Justice Zulfiqar pointed out that if a child has not seen his mother in a year, how would he recognise her and it's natural if he cries. Why do you want to keep the children away from the mother? The grandparents responded that they were not permitted to see the children.
The court ordered the mother and the grandparents, to file for guardianship of the children in the trial court, which must render a decision within two months.
Shahwaiz kept running away from his mother to his dada and dadi, refusing to go with his mother.

8,Underage bikers jeopardise road safety,"Negligence of parents, inefficiency of traffic regulators has catapulted road accidents involving juvenile bikers","Growing age adolescents, especially teenage boys, naturally undergo a phase of reckless abandonment, which increases their susceptibility to irresponsibly indulging in a range of harmful activities and addictions however, when parents start giving in to the fatuous tantrums of their children, deadly road collisions involving underage bikers become a common sight across roads.
In the current era of high inflation, relatively inexpensive modes of transportation like motorcycles have become immensely popular among millions of low-income families. On the flipside however, this increase in popularity of bikes has also led to a rise in the number of underage bikers on the roads, as many parents incautiously purchase the two-wheeled motor vehicles for their underage boys, who in the absence of stable monitoring by the Traffic Police, frequently end up in life-threatening crashes.
For instance, Ayesha, a schoolteacher’s 14-year-old son sustained injuries on his leg when his bike slipped while speeding on the road. “My elder son was tirelessly insisting that I buy him a motorbike. When I refused, he became rebellious and refused to go to school therefore, I had to give in to his demand,” regretted Ayesha.
Similarly, Muhammad Arif, a government employee’s, 16-year-old son Saad, too suffered multiple fractures on his leg during an accident, which later required him to have two surgeries and several other medical treatments. “Even though, I had willingly gifted the bike to him back then, now I wholeheartedly regret the decision,” shared Arif, who begged other parents to stop giving motorbikes to their underage children unless they were ready to face the fatal repercussions.
According to Chaudhry Shahid Hussain, a spokesman for a rescue organization, a sharp rise had been observed in the number of daily traffic accidents involving underage bikers, with up to 20 per cent of road collisions severely injuring young bikers between the ages of 12 to 18, who immediately required first aid at the hospital.
“At least 100 injured children end up in the trauma center on a daily basis due to speeding, out of which 80 per cent of the children have broken bones while the remaining 20 per cent suffer permanent paralysis,” reported Dr Sabir Memon, a renowned orthopaedic surgeon and Director at the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Trauma and Emergency Centre.
Muhammad Rizwan, a social leader, was of the opinion that despite acknowledging the risks associated with letting their children ride a motorbike, many parents were helpless in the face of their children’s obstinacy. “Since children these days consider the bike as a mode of entertainment, parents have an added responsibility of controlling their children's rebellious behavior,"" urged Rizwan.
“Apart from parents, the Traffic Police too should be held accountable for their failure to curtail the activities of underage bikers,” said Hassan Saber, an advocate, who further alleged that most underage drivers also engaged in one wheeling and street racing, which multiplied the danger posed to their own lives and to those of other people.
Speaking to the Express Tribune on the matter, the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Traffic Karachi, Iqbal Dara said, “The Karachi Traffic Police have expedited their efforts to curtail the activities of underage bikers in the wake of the Lahore incident. It is illegal for minors under the age of eighteen to ride a motorcycle. Every day, we issue up to 300 challans. Parents are requested to cooperate with us and not buy motorcycles for their children.”

9,Cut in Indus River flow contaminates water,Dissolved solids in water reaches dangerous level posing health risks,"As the Indus River System Authority (IRSA) has drastically cut flows in the Indus River, the effects on agriculture as well as on human health have begun to surface in Sindh.
Awakening to the aggravating situation of the sudden rise of total dissolved solids (TDS) in the river water, the authorities in Hyderabad have requested the Sindh Irrigation Department to increase water discharge in the river.
On Thursday the water testing lab of the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) found as high as 790 milligram per litre TDS in a sample taken from the river with 8.4 pH and 120 turbidity. After filtration at WASA's New Treatment Plant on Jamshoro Road the TDS reduced just by around 10% to 702 mg/litre.
According to the WASA Acting Managing Director Zeeshan Malik, the agency tries to maintain TDS at 500 mg/litre or less in the filtered water which is supplied to the city. The World Health Organization (WHO) has rated below 300 TDS as perfect for humans even though the readings between 300 to 600 are not considered bad enough.
TDS represents the concentration of dissolved substances, both inorganic and organic, in water. The common inorganic salts include the cations like calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium; and the anions like carbonates, nitrates, bicarbonates, chlorides and sulfates.
The high levels of TDS can cause gastrointestinal problems such as stomach pain and diarrhea, and in extreme cases, cause acute or chronic kidney and liver diseases.
The situation in Hyderabad, however, is expected to become worse in the days to come because of the shrunken flows in the Indus River.
On Thursday the Sindh Irrigation Department recorded 3,700 cusecs water upstream of the Kotri Barrage. Canals from Kotri Barrage bring water to WASA's filtration plants in Hyderabad.
Malik told The Express Tribune that the agency has started to advise the people to boil water at home before drinking. He said home based filtration techniques are also being shared with the consumers. According to him, the WASA started to receive complaints about high TDS levels over a week ago. The agency uses alum and chlorine for the filtration. Due to the huge disparity between the city's demand and WASA's filtration capacity, the due time required for settlement of solid substances in water is often not given.
WASA supplies filtered water, although of questionable quality, to most parts of the city. Yet many parts of Latifabad taluka are supplied water directly from the downstream river without fulfilling the required processes of the filtration.
Deputy Commissioner of Hyderabad, Tarique Qureshi, has written a letter to Irrigation Secretary to raise the TDS problem caused by the reduced river flows. Referring to the WASA's water lab reports, he described the situation as 'alarming'.
""The engineer concerned of the Irrigation Department may be informed to release more fresh water so that TDS scale may decrease to acceptable limits."" According to him, owing to the low river discharge WASA's reservoirs are also being filled with toxicity. The DC called for immediate increase in the river water discharge to address the problem.
