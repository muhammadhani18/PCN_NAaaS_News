0,Farm mechanization plan okayed,"1,200 watercourses to be paved under farmer prosperity scheme","Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has approved several schemes aimed at fostering prosperity of the farmers, including pavement of watercourses, farm mechanisation, focus on research and development for quality seeds and the provision of solar tube wells.
She approved Green Punjab…Prosperous Farmers Programme while chairing a meeting on the development of the agriculture sector in the province.
Initially, 1,200 watercourses will be paved at a cost of Rs10 billion. The chief minister issued directives to pave and rehabilitate all watercourses in Punjab in the next five years.
Under the farm mechanisation programme, 56 types of agricultural machinery along with 1,000 laser levelers will be purchased and given to the farmers on 60 per cent subsidy within three months. Under the two-year mechanisation plan, 23,000 agricultural implements and 2,280 laser land levelers will be given at a cost of Rs13.4 billion.
Farmers with land holding of up to 25 acres will be provided solar systems in two years.
Giving a detailed briefing on various projects for the uplift of the sector, the provincial agriculture secretary presented a plan to increase seed production from 400,000 tonnes to 600,000 tonnes.
A proposal to cultivate soybean seed on 100,000 acres in collaboration with the University of Agriculture Faisalabad was also discussed in the meeting.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was informed that there was 30 to 37% tax and duty on the import of high-tech agricultural machinery.
She pledged to approach the federal government to get the taxes and duties waived off on the import of high-tech machinery for the development of agriculture in the province.
She also agreed to contact the federal government to exempt the rice straw shredder machine from tax to curb smog and prevent crop residue burning.
The agriculture secretary said Pakistan needs 29 million tonnes of wheat and Punjab produces 26 million tonnes. However, 12% wheat and 18% rice yield have decreased due to manual sowing.
The chief minister was apprised that 1.75 million tonnes of seeds are required annually in the country.
Due to the unavailability of quality seeds, those worth Rs50 billion are imported annually.
Senior Provincial Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, Information Minister Azma Zahid Bukhari, Agriculture Minister Ashiq Hussain Kirmani, former senator Pervaiz Rashid, MPA Sania Ashiq, secretary of finance, president of the Bank of Punjab and other senior officers concerned attended the meeting.

1,Man kills wife for refusing to allow second marriage,Couple was married for one-and-a-half month,"A man, in connivance with his accomplices, killed his wife for refusing to permit a second marriage. The suspect attempted to cover up the murder as a robbery bid at his house.
Police apprehended the accused, registering a case against him and his accomplices.
The victim had been married for just one-and-a-half months to the alleged perpetrator.
Muqqadus, daughter of Zulfikar Ali from Alvi Park, Jaranwala, tied the knot with Mohammad Jameel Zahid on February 2. However, Jameel's affection for another woman led him to pressure his wife for a second marriage.
Muqqadus vehemently opposed this, leading to frequent disputes with Jameel.
Enraged by her refusal, Jameel, along with friends Saif and Qasim, devised a plan to kill her during a staged robbery.
Under the pretext of breaking their fast together, Jameel took his wife out last evening, where his friends ambushed them and opened fire.
Muqqadus Zulfikar was fatally shot on the spot, while Jameel sustained minor injuries. Police arrested Qasim and Saif, who confessed to their roles in planning and executing the murder at Jameel's behest.
Following a complaint from the victim's father, Zulfikar, the city police arrested the victim's husband, Mohammad Jameel Zahid, along with his two accomplices.
A murder case has been filed, and legal proceedings are under way.

2,‘Ping devices help save dolphins from nets’,Researchers endorse solution against bycatch related threats,"“Deployment of pinger sound producing devices is a potential solution to reduce the entanglement of the Indus river dolphins in the fishing nets. This technology can help conserve endangered river dolphins and promotes sustainable fishing,” stated researchers during a workshop.
Under a project, experiments have been conducted for the first time in Pakistan to assess effectiveness of the novel acoustic devices to reduce interaction of Indus river dolphin with the fishing nets. The project has been supported by the Darwin Innovation Fund and is implemented by WWF-Pakistan along the Indus river.
Through this project, trials of three different types of acoustic deterrents known as pinger were carried out in selected habitats within the Indus river on the fishing nets in Sindh and Punjab. The results based on the experiments conducted during the two fishing seasons indicated that pingers help to reduce dolphin’s interaction with the fishing nets and resultant bycatch related threats to dolphins.
Addressing the workshop, Dr Uzma Khan, Asia Lead for the Global River Dolphin Initiative, said that sound producing pinger devices are effective in deterring the Indus river dolphins from the fishing nets. Dr Khan said that dolphin entanglement is one of the major causes of mortality of these freshwater cetaceans in Indus waters where fish catch is the prime source of sustenance for fishers. She also mentioned similar studies that have been carried in other Asian countries that host river dolphins and the results are promising.
Dr Anser Mahmood Chatta, Director General Wildlife & Fisheries Department, South Punjab, called for studies to be conducted on a larger scale to check for any variation in results linked to temporal and spatial factors, which will offer strong evidence of using the pingers as potential solution to address the mortality issues.
The Indus river dolphin is one of the world's rarest mammals and the second most endangered freshwater river dolphin. It is one of the flagship species, which is only found in Pakistan and is an indicator of the biological health of the aquatic and terrestrial environment adjoining the Indus river. However, the population of this species confronts various threats, including entanglements in fishing nets, water pollution, poaching, fragmentation of habitat due to barrages and dolphin stranding in the irrigation canals.
