0,Kutchery Chowk expansion project awaits Punjab planning dept’s nod,"Project is in initial phase, expected to start next fiscal year","RAWALPINDI: Kutchery Chowk expansion and signal-free corridor from Kutchery Chowk to Pirwadhai Mor project is awaiting approval from the Punjab Planning and Development Department.
Former caretaker chief minister Mohsin Naqvi had laid the foundation stone of the project on Feb 3 without the approval of the Planning and Development Department. However,  the PC-I was prepared after the foundation stone was laid.
A senior official of the district administration told Dawn that the Communication and Works Department had sent PC-I for signal-free corridor and expansion of Kutchery Chowk worth Rs8.2 billion to Punjab Planning and Development Department before Eidul Fitr.
He said the project was in its initial phase and would likely be started next fiscal year.

Project is in initial phase, expected to start next fiscal year

He said last year, the Punjab government had approved the project to manage the traffic at Kutchery Chowk but in October it dropped the plan and asked the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) to make a new plan to expand the roads sans flyover and underpass.
However, in February this year, the caretaker government in Punjab handed over the project to Communication and Works Department. 
The official said the Communication and Works Department team conducted a new survey of the area and prepared a new PC-I and submitted it to the Punjab Planning and Development Department for approval.
According to the initial plan, 13 kanals and 40 marlas of land of Fatima Jinnah Women University building will be acquired, along with the land of former President House, Commissioner Office, Excise and Taxation Office building, two private houses and military land.
He said in the initial plan it estimated the cost of the project at Rs8.2 billion and it will have a total length of 7.6 kilometres. 
He said as per the initial plan, the signal-free corridor would be constructed from Kutchery Chowk to Pirwadhai Mor.
“Three underpasses will be constructed on The Mall and Peshawar Road at Pearl Continental Hotel Chowk, General Post Office Chowk and Qasim Market in front of Race Course while two protected U-turns will be built under the project at Chairing Cross Square and Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology (AFIC).
He said that the PC-I had been sent to Planning and Development Department after Communication and Works Department submitted the survey report. 
He said that the travelling time on Peshawar Road from Katcheri and Nur Khan Airbase was more than one hour and the government had decided to reduce it to 20 minutes by constructing signal free corridor.
He said that the cantonment authorities wanted to run public transport on the route from Saddar to Motorway and New Islamabad Airport once the project is completed.
When contacted, Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema said that the work on the project would be started as soon as the PC-I is approved as first the district administration would start acquiring land.

1,Interior minister likely to visit CDA office today,ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi is all set to make his first visit to the Capital Development Authority...,"ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi is all set to make his first visit to the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to get a briefing about the working of the civic agency likely on Wednesday (today).
The CDA falls under the administrative control of the Ministry of Interior. The interior minister will be given a detailed presentation on CDA’s ongoing development work as well as future plans.
Officials of civic agency remained busy on Tuesday in completing the presentation and other arrangements for the said visit. “The interior minister is likely to visit CDA on Wednesday to get a briefing and we are preparing working papers for his briefing,” said a CDA deputy director. 
Sources said that the minister will be briefed about the ongoing development projects that include the expansion project of Islamabad Expressway, a portion of Margalla Road to link D-12 and E-11, ongoing work of Park Road, 10th Avenue, 11th Avenue etc. Whereas, he will also be briefed about Islamabad’s master plan as well as development work in some new residential sectors and stalled sectors.
He would also be briefed about the planned projects.
Officials of CDA Dawn spoke to said that there are chances that the interior minister will give new targets to the civic agency.
They, however, said that CDA management should also convince the interior minister to lend his support for resolving two major issues of CDA, which could not be resolved without the acting support of the interior minister.
They said that a mega project of 10th Avenue, worth Rs 10.2 billion – which is a federal government-funded project has been facing delay in completion mainly because of funding. The officials said that the interior minister could play his role in securing maximum funds for this project for the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.
This project was supposed to be completed by March 2024, but it missed the deadline and sources said that so far only 25pc work is completed. Sources said that so far the federal government had released only Rs3 billion for this project.
Similarly, the officials said that the interior minister could play his role regarding a CDA summary, which is already lying somewhere in the interior ministry or the cabinet division, for the formation of Islamabad’s master plan commission.
They said that in December 2022, CDA had moved the summary after the commission formed in 2018 by the PTI government became inactive.
However, the said summary was not approved rather the interim government directed the CDA to send a revised summary, which was sent in February this year. Officials said that the interior minister’s help would be required to get it approved by the cabinet.
It is relevant to note here, according to the authors of the master plan of Islamabad, prepared in 1960, the blueprint of the capital was supposed to be revised every 20 years in accordance with the need of hours, but no proper revision was made yet that resulted in poor planning issues.
On the other hand, the successive governments made 45 selective changes, without any input from experts, whereas the incumbent government is also set to make another amendment, which is related to the land use change in Sector H-16, for converting two sub-sectors from institutions to residential.

RAWALPINDI: In its ongoing campaign for the implementation of new prices of Roti, the Rawalpindi district administration imposed a fine of Rs170,000 on seven tandoor owners for not selling Roti at Rs16 and Naan at Rs20 and sealed four tandoors.
Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema said the price magistrates were active in ensuring the implementation of the prices of Roti and Naan set by the Punjab government throughout the district.
He said that Roti weighing 100 grams would be sold at Rs16 and Naan weighing 120 grams at Rs20 while the district administration was continuing its efforts to ensure its implementation. 
He said those who were found guilty of the violation would face cases as the provincial government made it clear that no negligence would be tolerated in this regard.
He said that the implementation of the prices of Roti and Naan by the Punjab government would be ensured in all cases. He said that after the reduction in the flour price, the price of Roti has also been reduced.
Meanwhile, the All Pakistan Naanbai Association president was sent to jail after he was detained by police under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) for allegedly inciting people against the Punjab government’s notification regarding the reduction in the price of Roti.
Rizwan Zafar, a head constable posted at Banni police station, lodged an FIR saying that he was sitting at a hotel near Razi Hospital when he came across a message on WhatsApp where one person was seen disputing the notification of the Punjab government in a video statement.
He said in the FIR that the man identified himself as Shafiq Qureshi, the president of the naan-bai association. 
According to the FIR, Mr Qureshi claimed that the notification was fake and they would fight against the government and their organisations across Punjab had become active. 
While addressing the tandoor owners, he told them not to reduce the prices of Roti as per the government’s directive. The police said that the said person incited people against the government by issuing statements against government policies and disrupting public peace.
Crackdown in Attock
The Attock district administration on Tuesday launched a crackdown on Naanbais, arresting nine tandoor owners and imposing a fine of Rs94,500. During the crackdown, 706 tandoors across the district were inspected.
Talking to journalists, Attock Deputy Commissioner Rao Atif Raza said that price magistrates would carry out surprise visits to tandoors in all six tehsils in the morning and evening and the government would not allow anyone to sell bread at high prices.
Responding to a question, he claimed the price of a 20kg bag of flour had dropped by Rs500. He said the price list should be displayed in all shops and the local administration should ensure its implementation.
DC Raza said that the Punjab government had fixed the price of Roti at Rs16 for 100 grams, while the price of Naan was fixed at Rs20 for 120 grams. He requested the public to assist the divisional administration and register their complaints on 0800-02345.

Sources said special secretary primary and secondary health department Mohammad Iqbal ordered a regular inquiry under PEEDA against the medical superintendent (MS), two pharmacists, emergency director, charge nurse and a pharmacy technician found guilty of exhibiting negligence and misconduct while refusing availability of a life-saving injection to a patient under cardiac stress despite availability of the injection in the indoor pharmacy of the government health facility. 
The inquiry report stated that the MS of the hospital was unaware of the availability of essential lifesaving Heparin injection in the indoor pharmacy of the hospital. Furthermore, when the attendant of the patient informed him about the unavailability of the injection he failed to manage the issue. 
The director emergency was responsible for managing affairs of emergency and checking the register, supply and availability of lifesaving medicines in the emergency. However, he failed to fulfil his responsibilities. 
The pharmacist/pharmacy manager and the pharmacist have been accused of failing to ensure the availability of medicines in the pharmacy store. The junior pharmacy technician misguided the attendant that vial of Heparin injection was empty. 
The charge nurse was found guilty of tampering with the name of the patient in the emergency register. She accepted her misconduct before the probe committee, and was subsequently found guilty of inefficiency and misconduct. 
The dispenser has been accused of ‘misguiding the attendant that the vial of Heparin injection was empty against the fact that half of the dose of injection was available and could be administered to the patient till the availability of the full dose’. He was also found guilty of “felonious negligence, inefficiency and misconduct.”
It is pertinent to mention that the health department of Punjab has adopted a Medicine Inventory Management System (MIMS) in all hospitals through which the concerned authorities remain aware of the availability status of medicines, the sources said.

In the letter sent to the IPC secretary, the deputy director general (Admin) of PSB, Mansoor Ahmed Khan, stated that while the PSB director general was on ex-Pakistan leave, the ministry had assigned the charge to a junior officer of BS-19.
The letter termed this as against the management pay scale policy approved by the prime minister that provides that “the current charge/additional charge of the position of heads of autonomous bodies in MP-scales only be granted to a civil or government servants of equivalent grade and that too with the approval of appointing authority which is the prime minister of Pakistan.”
It further said that the officer who had been assigned the look after charge “requisitioned the services of various officers on deputation basis for PSB which is purely an administrative matter which also involved financial implications. Such decision does not fall in the ambit of look after charge range, therefore, is violative of clarification of Establishment Division.”
The Establishment Division issued an office memorandum on April 9, 2021 in which the clarification about the look after charge was circulated among all the ministries.
In the clarification, the Establishment Division stated that “there is no provision of look after charge in Civil Servants Act, 1973 and Rules made thereunder, rather an officer can be deputed temporarily as an internal arrangement to look after the work of another post for disposal of day to day work of urgent and routine nature.”
It added: “as a matter of principle, the senior most officer is normally asked by the head of Division/Department to look after the work of a post when its incumbent is temporarily away.”
As per the Establishment Division’s memorandum, the officer on current charge cannot exercise the powers related to financial and administrative in nature.
The PSB also termed the assigning of look after charge and subsequent posting and transfer by the acting DG against the law laid down by superior courts.
The letter concluded: “the above mentioned deputations and postings were made by the IPC ministry in PSB in violation of the constitution of the PSB, clarification of Establishment Division, laws, rules and against the principles settled by superior courts, therefore, have no legal sanctity in the eye of law.”
