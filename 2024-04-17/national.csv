0,"Reeling from floods, Balochistan braces for even more rain",Met Department advises authorities to take precautionary measures; CM forms body to probe causes of urban flooding.,"QUETTA: As a three-day spell of torrential rainfall, which resulted in the deaths of 10 people across Balochistan, ended on Tuesday, the Met Department has issued a forecast for more downpours from today (Wednesday).
In an advisory, the Meteorological Centre of Balochistan said a “powerful” spell of rain was approaching the province and predicted heavy rains with thunderstorms in various districts starting Wednesday.
The Met office has advised the authorities, including the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and the district administration, to stay alert and take necessary measures to deal with heavy rains.
“Heavy rains and thunderstorms will hit the coastal district Gwadar, Kech, Awaran, Chagai, Panjgur, Kharan, Washuk and Noshki during the next 36 to 48 hours,” a senior official of the Met Centre said.

The advisory warned that the downpour could lead to urban flooding in cities and flash floods in seasonal nullahs and streams due to rainfall in catchment areas.
People have been warned against staying in open places and taking refuge under the trees as lightning could strike during rain and thunderstorms.
Committee to probe urban flooding
Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti has formed a fact-finding committee to investigate the causes of urban flooding in Quetta during the spell of torrential rainfall, the provincial government spokesperson said.
The chief minister will head the committee with officers of his inspection unit, Planning and Development department’s chief and the city’s superintending engineer as its members, Shahid Rind told the media on Tuesday.
The committee would “identify the flaws and negligence” that led to urban flooding in the provincial capital.
Mr Rind added that the committee would inspect all development schemes related to roads and sewerage systems in Quetta during the last three years and suggest measures to prevent urban flooding in future.
The committee will “have full access” to relevant records and personnel of the departments concerned.
Earlier on Monday, the Balochistan government declared a rain and urban flood emergency in at least 25 districts of the province, which were badly affected by heavy rains and thunderstorms.
The provincial capital received around 156mm of rain over three days, according to the Quetta Division Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat, resulting in urban flooding in many areas.
Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat said over 200 employees of the departments concerned are being sacked for negligence of duty during heavy rains. He said the main reason for rain damage was encroachment on 82 nullahs in and around the provincial capital that blocked the flow of rain water coming from roads and human settlements.
Almost all main roads of Quetta were flooded as sewers failed to drain water due to blockage, as per officials.Parts of Makran, including Pasni, Kech, Panjgur, Gwadar, and other divisions of Balochistan, also suffered huge damages to infrastructure and homes during the previous spell of rainfall.

1,Tehran to release Pakistanis on board seized vessel,Diplomatic sources told Dawn the men would likely be released “within the framework of the amicable relations between the two countries”.,"ISLAMABAD: Iran has okayed the release of Pak­istani nationals on board a Portuguese-flagged contai­ner ship, which was seized by Iranian forces in the Strait of Hormuz following its retaliation against Israel for an attack on its Damascus consulate earlier this month.
Diplomatic sources told Dawn on Tuesday that the Iranian government had granted permission to release Pakistani nationals on board the MSC Aries, which Tehran insists is linked to Israel.
Sources said the Pakis­tani nationals were expe­cted to be released within the next few days.
According to Reuters, MSC leased the Aries from Gortal Shipping, an affiliate of Zodiac Maritime. Zo­­diac is partly owned by Isr­aeli businessman Eyal Ofer.
Although it is not yet clear exactly how many Pakistanis are on board the seized vessel, media repo­rts said that the ship’s chief operating officer, Muham­mad Adnan Aziz, and at least one other crew member hailed from Pakistan.
At least 25 people were on board the ship when it was boarded by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz for “violating maritime laws”.
Diplomatic sources told Dawn that the men would likely be released “within the framework of the amicable relations between the two countries”.
Meanwhile, Portugal’s foreign ministry summo­n­­ed Iran’s ambassador on Tu­­­esday to demand the im­­mediate release of the MSC Aries, Reuters reported.
The ministry said in a statement after the meeting that it “will await the results of this formal measure and evaluate any additional steps, depending on those”.

2,"Officials didn’t follow rules in handling cipher, IHC told",Notice issued to Adiala jail administration on Bushra Bibi’s petition; plea seeking her shifting to jail dismissed.,"ISLAMABAD: The counsel for former prime minister Imran Khan, Barrister Salman Safdar, accused ex-principal secretary Azam Khan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of not following rules for protecting secret documents, which led to the charge of misplacing the cipher against Mr Khan.
Barrister Safdar argued before the Islamabad High Court division bench on Tuesday that Azam Khan was required to monitor the movement of the confidential diplomatic cable and register its location according to Rule 6 (III) of the Secretariat Instructions. He claimed that Azam Khan did not follow the rules and maintain a record of the secret document.
The counsel also stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was required to hold an inquiry and inform the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and register an FIR under Section 8.17 of the Manual of “Security of Classified Matters in Government Departments.” However, the ministry did not follow the rules, and Azam Khan’s negligence led to the FIA sabotaging its own case by citing him as a prosecution witness.
Barrister Safdar concluded his arguments, and the bench adjour­ned further hearing till Wednesday (today). Special prosecutor retired justice Hamid Ali Shah will advance arguments from today.

Notice issued to Adiala jail administration on Bushra Bibi’s petition; plea seeking her shifting to jail dismissed

The petition stated that Bushra Bibi suffered from health issues and believed that it was due to eating a poisonous meal. She also claimed discomfort in the sub-jail environment and requested her shifting to Adiala jail.
Bushra Bibi’s petition
Separately, Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb issued notices to the government and the administration of Adiala jail on the petition of Bushra Bibi against alleged violation of her rights.
Bushra Bibi claimed that she was poisoned and subjected to psychological torture in her Banigala residence, which has been declared a sub-jail.
The petition requested the court to ensure protection of her fundamental rights and allow her medical check-up by Shaukat Khanam Memorial Hospital.
Plea dismissed
In another development, the court dismissed a petition filed by Bushra Bibi seeking her transfer from her Banigala  residence to Adiala jail due to non-prosecution as her lawyers remained absent during the hearing.

3,Key decisions likely as cabinet meets today,"According to the meeting agenda, nine important issues will be discussed including reorganisation of accountability courts in the country.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called a meeting of the federal cabinet on Wednesday in which some important decisions are likely to be taken.
According to the agenda of the meeting available with Dawn, nine important issues will be discussed including reorganisation of accountability courts in the country.
A source in the government told Dawn that since the National Accountabi­li­­ty Bureau (NAB) has be­­come toothless and a large number of its cases have been transferred to other anti-graft watchdogs such as the Federal Investi­ga­tion Agency (FIA), Fed­eral Board of Revenue (FBR), State Bank of Pak­is­­tan (SBP), Securities and Exchange Commis­sion of Pakistan (ECP), sev­­eral accountability courts have become redundant.
Under a proposal to be discussed at the cabinet meeting, the government intends to reduce the number of accountability cour­­ts and re-adjust their jud­ges to other courts.
One of the points of federal cabinet meeting’s agenda is about reorganisation of accountability courts.
Another important agenda item the cabinet is likely to approve is the Federal Public Private Partnership (P3) Policy of Pakistan 2023-24 which aimed at facilitating investors in different fields.
The meeting would also decide about the proposed bill regarding establishment of National Institute of Modern Scie­n­ces and Federal Educa­tion & Professional Training.
It is likely to approve the conferment of foreign award for Foreign Affairs Services upon Manzoor Ahmad Chaudhry, Ambassador, by the government of Cote d’Ivoire.
The cabinet will also designate Special Court-II (Anti-Terrorism), Islam­abad, to try cases under Official Secrets Act, 1923.
The meeting is likely to allow appointment of Federal Inspector of Drugs (FIDs) and his area of jurisdiction under Drug Regulatory Autho­rity of Pakistan (DRAP).
A draft MoU between Ministry of Labour, Qatar, and Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development will also be tabled for approval in the meeting.
The meeting is also li­­kely to ratify the decisions taken by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet in its meeting held on April 4.

4,PTI gets in touch with Fazlur Rehman,Latter says reservations need to be removed but “channels of communications” between the two parties should be kept open.,"ISLAMABAD: The PTI made an attempt on Mon­day to pacify JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s anger following last week’s rally in Pishin where inappropriate slogans were raised against him. 
Senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser had a telephone conversation with the Ma­­­­u­lana, expressing regrets over the episode.
“Such unfortunate incidents lead to bad blood between political parties and hinder attempts to bring together different actors on one platform,” Mr Qaiser said.
Aslam Ghori, a JUI-F office-bearer, said the conversation touched on the post-election situation, especially prospects for formation of a broad-based anti-government alliance.  
Maulana Fazlur Reh­man thanked Asad Qaiser for getting in touch with him, recalling that “we have had cordial discussions earlier too, but there were some reservations as well”. “These reservations need to be removed,” the Maulana told Mr Qaiser. He, however, added that “channels of communications” between the two parties should be kept open.

5,"Over 1.25m URLs blocked over objectionable content, PTA tells SHC",Telecom regulator says blocking links is ‘ongoing exercise’.,"KARACHI: The Pak­istan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has blocked more than 1.25 million URLs over objectionable content, the telecom sector regulator told the Sindh High Court on Tuesday. 
The authority submitted its reply to a petition filed against “objectionable, unethical, immoral and unlawful” content being uploaded on social media platforms.
The regulator told the SHC that out of the 1,253,522 blocked URLs, 988,659 were banned for indecent and immoral content, 90,980 for content against the glory of Islam, 84,130 for content against security and defence of the country, 52,787 for spreading sectarian and hate speech, 10, 363 for defamation and impersonation, 10,252 for being proxies, 9,366 for miscellaneous reasons and 6,985 URLs for the contempt of court.
Providing a breakdown, the PTA said out of blocked URLs 139,415 were Facebook links, 98,597 of Tiktok, 50,975 of YouTube, 18,123 of Instagram, 5,184 of Snackvideo, 4,285 of Bigo and Linkee and 550 of Dailymotion and 887,435 miscellaneous.

Telecom regulator says blocking links is ‘ongoing exercise’

The regulator told SHC that it was maintaining a record of around 1.34m, out of which over 71,722 were still accessible, and requests to block 16,122 URLs were rejected.
In order to keep the database updated, the URLs need to be frequently verified and re-verified, and it was “an ongoing exercise”.
The PTA submitted its reply after it was made a respondent in a petition moved by some YouTube content creators, who had pleaded that objectionable, unethical, immoral and unlawful content was being uploaded on social media platforms.
A two-judge SHC bench, headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, resumed the hearing on Tuesday and provided a copy of the regulator’s reply to the petitioners’ lawyer.
Regarding the petition in question, the authority asserted that it had blocked the Instagram and YouTube URLs as mandated under Section 37(1) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.
The said section titled “Unlawful online content” empowers PTA to “remove or block or issue directions for removal or blocking of access to an information through any information system if it considers it necessary in the interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court or commission of or incitement to an offence under this Act.”
The PTA also questioned the petition’s maintainability on the grounds that petitioners have no ground to file it as they didn’t approach PTA to address their concerns. The authority also requested the petitioners to share the exact URLs of objectionable content, but they did not provide the same, PTA claimed.
Later, the hearing was adjourned till May 15 after a deputy attorney general requested for more time to seek instructions from remaining respondents — zonal directors and director of FIA’s cybercrime wing — to file comments.
At an earlier hearing, the SHC had directed the PTA to enforce relevant laws and rules to prevent and remove objectionable content on social media platforms.
The counsel for petitioners, Usman Farooq, contended that PTA had the authority under the Prevention of Electronic Crime Act, 2016 and the Removal and Blocking of Unlawful Online Content Rules, 2021, to remove and block vulgar and unlawful content and take appropriate action.
However, he maintained that the authority was not taking prompt action and asked the SHC to issue directives to block objectionable content.
Mr Farooq also asserted that objectionable content was not only severely affecting social and cultural norms and values but also against the injunctions of Islam.

6,Pakistan tops world in hep C infections,WHO’s Global Hepatitis Report 2024 shows country accounts for 44pc of new infections from unsafe injections.," 

Irfan Khan

LAHORE: An alarming report from the World Hea­lth Organisa­tion (WHO) indicates that Pakistan had the highest number of viral hepatitis C infections in the world, around 8.8 million, and accounts for 44 per cent of all new hepatitis C infections attributed to unsafe medical injections.
In previous years, Egypt repor­ted the largest number of hepatitis C and B cases, followed by Pakistan.
The data from 187 countries shows the estimated number of deaths from viral hepatitis increased from 1.1 million in 2019 to 1.3 million in 2022.  Of these, 83pc were caused by hepatitis B and 17pc by hepatitis C, according to the report.
If the number of hepatitis B and hepatitis C cases are combined, then Pakis­tan ranks fifth in the world, only trailing behind China, India, Indonesia and Nige­ria, with around 12.6 million cases reported in 2022.

WHO’s Global Hepatitis Report 2024 reveals country accounts for 44pc of new infections from unsafe injections

The WHO’s Global Hepa­titis Report 2024 notes that ten countries account for nearly two thirds of the global burden of viral hepatitis B and C, with Ethio­pia, Bang­la­desh, Vietnam, Philippines and the Rus­sian Federation rounding off the top ten.
For hepatitis C, six countries — China, India, Indo­nesia, Pakistan, Russian Federation and US — represent 50pc of the global burden However, the report states that Egypt has become the first country to achieve gold tier status on the path to elimination of hepatitis C, based on fulfilling WHO criteria that will set the country up to ach­ieve the reduced incidence and mortality targets of full elimination before 2030.
In addition, as of Dec 2023, 16 countries have been validated for eliminating either one or more among HIV, syphilis and HBV, the report noted.
Commenting on the report, senior medical experts say most of the patients in Pakistan are either diagnosed incidentally or get symptomatic when their illness advances years after getting the infection.
Dr Masood Sheikh from the Lahore General Hospital told Dawn that Pakistan has been bearing the second-largest burden of hepatitis C globally, with a nationwide prevalence of 4.8 per cent.
“From 2015 to 2019, there was a 5pc increase in hepatitis C-related deaths and an 8pc increase in hepatitis B-related deaths,” he said.
The transmission of the virus increased manifold in Pakistan due to ignorance of sterilisation techniques, sharing personal items, and unsafe healthcare practices. He lamen­ted that the burden of liver cancers and transplants has risen three-fold all over the country over the past 20 years.
“Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can cause a range of health problems and can be fatal,” Dr Sheikh said.
The latest WHO report also contains information on access to health products from 38 countries for the viral hepatitis response, which together account for about 80pc of the global disease burden of viral hepatitis B and C.
Updated WHO estimates indicate that 254 million people live with hepatitis B and 50 million with hepatitis C in 2022 all over the world.
“Half the burden of chronic hepatitis B and C infections was diagnosed in 30–54 age group, 12pc among children under 18 years of age,” reads the report. Men account for 58pc of all the cases.
However, drug pricing data offers a silver lining; the lowest reported price of daclatasvir/sofosbuvir — a two drug combo for the treatment of hepatitis C — for a 12-week course of treatment was from Pakistan at about $33 for a generic course of treatment. The highest reported price was from China, at about $10,000.

He said the law and order situation in Sindh requires immediate attention and those interested in restoring a sense of security among the residents of the region would have to ensure action against feudal lords and MPs supporting the gangs of dacoits taking refuge in katcha areas along the Indus River.
“A stringent action against the facilitators of the anti-social elements is a must to restore law and order in the province,” Wardag said. 
The seasoned politician also criticised the incumbent judicial system of the country, noting that seekers of justice often have to wait for decades for the adjudication of their cases. Drawing a comparison with the modern world, where cases are decided within six months, Wardag suggested improving the local judicial system by setting a six-month adjudication time for criminal cases and one year for civil cases.
About high power rates for farm tube-wells, Mr Wardag suggested that the government offer solar systems on an installation basis for running the tube-wells to facilitate the farmers.
