PRIME Minister Shehbaz Sharif greets Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Faisal Bin Farhan Al Saud, at the PM House, on Tuesday—White Star

 
• Emphasises continued bilateral cooperation for regional security
• Calls on President Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz, meets FM Dar
• Discusses potential for enhancing trade, investment cooperation
• Both nations call for immediate ceasefire in Gaza
ISLAMABAD: Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud on Tuesday praised Pakistan’s proactive, business-oriented approach to seeking investments and expressed high expectations for “significant benefits” for both countries from the expanded investments.
Speaking at a media conference at the Foreign Office along with his host, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, after a counterpart meeting, Mr Farhan also emphasised continued bilateral cooperation for regional security alongside the initiative to expand economic cooperation.
“We will continue to work for the economic prosperity and security of our region,” he said, noting the similar geopolitical outlooks of both countries.
The Saudi foreign minister was in Pakistan on a two-day visit, accompanied by a high-level delegation to initiate negotiations on prospective investment projects. The trip was also intended to serve as a precursor to an anticipated visit by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Pakistan later in the year.
The Saudi delegation’s visit followed a foundational meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the Saudi crown prince — known by his initials MbS — in Makkah earlier this month, where commitments were made to intensify economic engagement.
A central aspect of the understanding reached at that meeting was to fast-track an initial $5 billion investment tranche under a broader Saudi commitment to invest $25bn in Pakistan over the next five years.
“We are very impressed not just by the breadth of the opportunities that exist but also by the format [for facilitating investment],” the Saudi foreign minister said.
“This gives us some very, very significant confidence that we will be able to move forward on those projects we identify as worthy of investment,” he said, adding that his country “will be moving significantly ahead on a multitude of opportunities”.
He, however, avoided naming any specific projects in which the kingdom was planning to invest.
During their meeting before the media conference, Mr Farhan and Mr Dar discussed the potential for trade and investment collaboration.
At the presser, Mr Dar reassured Saudi investors of Pakistan’s commitment to fully supporting them.
He recalled Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s directive to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and relevant ministries to “move forward on investment projects in a diligent and time-bound manner in a fast track”.
Saudi-Pakistan investment conference
The two foreign ministers co-chaired the investment conference, which was the main feature of the Saudi delegation’s visit to discuss potential investments in Pakistan.
During the conference, the Pakistani side highlighted legal and administrative reforms, including establishing the SIFC to streamline investments.
Mr Dar spotlighted opportunities in sectors such as agriculture, IT, and mining and invited Saudi investors to invest in them.
Investments in state-owned enterprises, which are being put up for privatisation, were also solicited. Technical teams later delved into various investment proposals.
The Saudi delegation expressed its interest in improving the investment environment and appreciated SIFC’s role in resolving past investment and business issues related to Saudi investments.
The conference was anticipated to lead to a structured investment framework under the SIFC for dealing with Saudi investments.
Meetings with PM, president
The Saudi delegation, led by Foreign Minister Farhan, also separately met President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Sharif.
President Zardari expressed Pakistan’s desire to transform the relationship with Saudi Arabia into a long-term strategic and economic partnership.
Mr Sharif, meanwhile, underscored the need for both sides to work closely to expedite the first phase of Saudi investments in Pakistan under the new arrangement.
Middle East situation
The Saudi foreign minister, in his remarks at the Foreign Office presser, called for de-escalation in the region in the aftermath of Iranian retaliatory strikes against Israel and the continued Israeli aggression in Gaza.
“We are in an unstable region. The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is inflaming the region. We do not need more conflict, we do not need more confrontation,” he said.
De-escalation, he maintained, should be “everybody’s priority” and differences should be resolved through dialogue instead of use of force.
He criticised the international community for failing to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and ensuring unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Gazans.
Mr Salman also called out the world’s double standards, noting that the killing of six Western aid workers moved the international community on aid in a way the death of 33,000 Palestinians couldn’t.
Mr Dar endorsed Mr Salman’s call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance.

1,PML-N loses two National Assembly seats in one day,"LHC sets aside Nahra’s win in Gujranwala, Kanjoo’s victory in Lodhran; Nankana MPA’s victory notification also ‘suspended’.","• LHC sets aside Nahra’s win in Gujranwala, Kanjoo’s victory in Lodhran; Nankana MPA’s victory notification also ‘suspended’
• Yasmin Rashid challenges Nawaz’s win from Lahore
LAHORE: The ruling PML-N lost two of its National Assembly seats on Tuesday after separate benches of the Lahore High Court set aside the victory notifications of its lawmakers elected from Gujranwala and Lodhran.
In addition, another PML-N MPA from Nankana Sahib had his victory notification suspended on a petition filed by his PTI-backed opponent.
Meanwhile, incarcerated PTI leader Dr Yasmin Rashid has challenged former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s victory from Lahore’s NA-130 constituency before an LHC election tribunal.
On Tuesday, LHC Justice Shahid Karim passed an order against NA-81 (Gujranwala) MNA Azhar Qayum Nahra, allowing a petition by PTI-backed independent candidate Chaudhry Bilal Ijaz.
The petitioner’s counsel contended that his client was initially declared elected by 7,791 votes. However, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) conducted a recount on a request of the respondent, Mr Nahra, after which he was declared victorious with a margin of 3,100 votes.
At least 10,000 votes of the petitioner were declared cancelled in the recount, the counsel said.
He argued that the commission violated the law by allowing a recount after the formation of the election tribunals to hear challenges to election disputes and asked the court to strike down the ECP’s impugned recount order for being unlawful.
Justice Karim observed that in ordering the recount, the ECP had ignored the Supreme Court’s ruling. The judge also asked the ECP lawyer if ignoring the Supreme Court’s decision constituted contempt of court.
The judge maintained that the commission could not entertain complaints against election disputes after tribunals had started working, and allowed the petition, setting aside the notification of the respondent’s victory.
Meanwhile, the Bahawalpur bench of the Lahore High Court unseated Abdul Rehman Kan­joo, the PML-N MNA from NA-154 Lodhran, and declared the petitioner, PTI-backed Rana Faraz Noon, as the winner.
According to the PTI candidate’s lawyer Makhdoom Kalimullah Hashmi, the LHC bench, deciding an intra-court appeal (ICA), declared null and void the notification issued by the ECP, regarding Mr Kanjoo’s victory in the Feb 8 general elections.
Mr Kanjoo, a former minister, has also taken oath as an MNA in the National Assembly session.
In both cases, the petitioners — who were runners up in the polls — are likely to be notified as the returned candidates following the success of their pleas.
PP-133 notification suspended
Also on Tuesday, the LHC suspended the victory notification of PML-N’s Rana Arshad from PP-133, Nankana Sahib.
Justice Shahid Karim issued the stay order on a petition filed by PTI-backed independent candidate Mohammad Atif, who pleaded that he was initially declared the returned candidate with a margin of over 3,500 votes.
However, he said, the ECP held a recount on an application of the respondent and declared him victorious by 2,500 votes. He asked the court to set aside the recounting order of the ECP and the impugned notification of the respondent’s victory for being unlawful.
The judge suspended the notification and sought a reply from the ECP and other respondents.
Yasmin’s challenge
Filed through her lawyers, Ahmed Awais and Rana Mudassir, the former Punjab health minister’s petition argued that the ECP issued Mr Sharif’s victory notification in violation of the law.
Previously on Feb 13, the LHC dismissed a writ petition filed by Ms Rashid against Mr Sharif’s victory, directing her to approach the ECP.
On Feb 14, the ECP issued a notification of Mr Sharif’s victory from NA-130.
He won the Feb 8 election with 179,310 votes while Ms Rashid came second with 104,485 votes.
Now, the latter has filed an election petition before the tribunal with a request to set aside the victory of the former prime minister and to declare her returned candidate. She alleged that the ECP manipulated the election results to ensure her defeat.
Balochistan speaker
Separately on Tuesday, the ECP suspended the victory notification of Balochistan Assembly Speaker Abdul Khaliq Khan Achakzai from PB-51, Chaman.
The notification has been suspended until the outcome of re-polling at 12 polling stations, scheduled for April 21, along with by elections in 23 national and provincial assembly constituencies and a re-election in PB-51 (Qila Abdullah).
Meanwhile, the commission also notified Sadaf Ihsan as a returned candidate for the seat reserved for women in the National Assembly from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The notification of her victory was suspended on March 4 after the JUI-F complained that she was not among the names the party had submitted for election to reserved seats.

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this report incorrectly identified the Nankana Sahib constituency of PML-N’s Rana Arshad as NA-133. It is PP-133. The error is regretted.

2,PTI alleges ‘pre-poll’ rigging in lead up to by-polls,"Party to move IHC against installation of ""glass wall"" in room where Imran meets visitors.","ISLAMABAD: With by-elections on vacant seats of the national and provincial assemblies less than a week away, the PTI has accused the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of pre-poll rigging in the run-up to the elections slated to be held on April 21.
The former ruling party also decided to organise public gatherings in constituencies where by-polls are slated to be held in which Omar Ayub, Barrister Gohar, and Sher Afzal Marwat will “ensure their presence”.
In a press conference on Tuesday, PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub said the PTI candidate in PP-36 was being harassed by the police which raided and encircled his house and also brought a prison van. The PTI leader claimed that the PTI was not allowed to run its election campaign. He alleged that Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and the Punjab IG were using “brutal and coercive tactics against PTI leaders and workers in other constituencies” to rig elections.
Omar Ayub claimed that the number of polling stations was reduced and they were set up in remote areas to discourage voters in an alleged bid to influence elections. He claimed that Gujranwala RPO (regional police officer), a relative of the PML-N candidate, was given the charge of Wazirabad. “The officials are instructed that Form-45 should not be given to the PTI nominees,” he alleged.

Judicial inquiry
Speaking about the Bahawal­nagar incident, the opposition leader sought a transparent judicial inquiry into the “clash” between the police officials and army personnel to ensure accountability. “The incident is reflects the lack of discipline in the law-enforcement institutions,” he added.
Criticising the economic policies, he said the “economic collapse was followed by the worst food inflation that jumped to 45 per cent coupled by an alarming surge in unemployment and unbearable cost of living”.
Talking about the Iran and Israel issue, he said that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar should have given a policy statement on the “growing tensions in the Middle East” but unfortunately the foreign minister did not have any time to give any statement in this regard.
The PTI leader, however, welcomed the Saudi delegation’s visit to Pakistan but linked investments with the rule of law. “Why would investors come to such a country where lawlessness and anarchy reign supreme,” he added.
Omar Ayub demanded that Bushra Bibi’s medical check-up be done by a doctor from the Shaukat Khanum Hospital, alleging that “secret cameras” were installed in her bedroom, which was condemnable and should be removed.
About the opposition alliance, Mr Ayub asserted that the six-party opposition alliance came into being with the sole objective of the restoration of the Constitution and upholding the rule of law in the country.
He said the opposition alliance held “historic public gatherings” in Pishin and Chaman and challenged the PML-N and PPP to hold such public meetings in these areas.
Glass wall in Adiala Jail
In a separate press conference outside Adiala Jail, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said a glass wall had been erected in the room where PTI founder Imran Khan meets his family members and party leaders.
“Today Imran Khan has directed Sher Afzal Marwat to file a contempt petition in the Islamabad High Court against the erection of the glass wall which is a severe violation of the court’s orders,” he said after meeting Imran Khan in the jail.

3,Army vows stringent action against online trolls,ISLAMABAD: The military leadership on Tuesday pledged to take stringent action against individuals disparaging the...,"ISLAMABAD: The military leadership on Tuesday pledged to take stringent action against individuals disparaging the armed forces, emphasising a zero-tolerance approach to maligning and attacks on their reputation.
The corps commanders and the principal staff officers of the army, who met at the General Head­quarters for their monthly conference, with army chief Gen Asim Munir presiding over the session, discussed the “malicious propaganda campaign”, which they believed was aimed at demoralising the armed forces.
While expressing concern over the situation, the top brass vowed not to “allow such efforts to succeed and that as per the law and constitution, stern action will be ensured”.
Over the past few years, the army has encountered escalating criticism, especially on social media platforms, with such discussions intensifying amid recent political turmoil. While many of these conversations have focused on the military’s involvement in civilian governance and its impact on democracy in the country, some critics have crossed the line with their remarks.
Recently, an incident in Bahawalnagar involving the army troops and police officials sparked widespread outrage on social media. Videos that showed police personnel being beaten by troops circulated extensively, intensifying public reaction.
The military later desc­r­i­bed the incident as “unfortunate” and announced to jointly probe it along with police. But at the same time, it blamed elements with “vested motives” for cashing in on the issue by “fanning vitriolic propaganda on social media”.
The recent statement from the corps commanders’ conference was triggered by discussions on social media regarding the Bhawalnagar incident.
The military leadership regretted that “unfounded and baseless allegations” against security forces have become “a fashion”. They consider the malicious “propaganda” was part of a sinister design to divide the masses and the armed forces.
Counter-terrorism ops
Gen Munir praised the successes of counter-terrorism operations and dir­ected their continuation to “pro-actively deny any space to the terrorists”.
While discussing the attack against Chinese workers in Bisham in which five of them lost their lives and incidents of violence in Balochistan, the participants of the conference were told that the terrorists having sanctuaries in Afghanistan were “acting as proxies” against Pakistan and its economic interests, especially China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.
Iran-Israel conflict
The military expressed concern about the potential risks posed by escalating tensions in the Middle East due to the start of direct conflict between Iran and Israel with the former retaliating the bombing of its consulate in Damascus by the latter.
“The forum expressed concern over escalating tensions in the Middle East and noted that a wider regional conflict could ensue if both sides did not de-escalate immediately,” ISPR said in its statement.
By highlighting the possibility of a wider regional conflict if both of the involved parties do not de-escalate immediately, the military demonstrated a neutral stance in the conflict.

4,‘Need three years to implement IMF reforms’,• Aurangzeb says discussions on new package to progress by second week of May • Stresses importance of maintaining balanced,"• Aurangzeb says discussions on new package to progress by second week of May
• Stresses importance of maintaining balanced ties with US, China
• State Dept says it supports efforts to manage Pakistan’s debt burden
WASHINGTON: Fin­a­nce Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said that Pakistan requires up to three years to implement some of the structural cha­nges prescribed by the Int­ernational Monetary Fund (IMF) to alleviate the country’s ongoing financial struggles and reduce reliance on bailouts.
The minister, who is currently in Washington to attend the annual spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank Group, also met the chiefs of both institutions on Tuesday and discussed with them the possibility of a new, long-term Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the IMF.
In an interview with AFP, Mr Aurangzeb disclosed that Pakistan is in talks for a substantial multi-year IMF loan programme valued at “billions” of dollars. Previous reports indicated Pakis­tan’s interest in a $6bn-$8bn EFF package spanning three years to bolster its economic stability.
“By the time we get to the second or third week of May, I do think we’ll start getting into the contours of discussions” about a new programme, he said.
The IMF’s Extended Fund Facility provides financial assistance to countries facing serious medium-term balance of payments problems due to structural weaknesses that require time to address.
In his Tuesday meetings, the finance minister addressed reforms proposed by the IMF to meet targets agreed upon during negotiations for the current programmes, expiring later this month.
In one of these meetings, Mr Aurangzeb briefed Hela Cheikhrouhou of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) on ongoing reforms in Pakistan’s taxation, energy and privatisation sectors.
He also expressed Pakistan’s commitment to collaborate closely with the IFC “in the priority areas of securitisation of remittances, mining, airport management and capacity-building,” as his team stated.
In interviews with various US and international media outlets, the finance minister expressed optimism about market confidence, which spurred him to initiate discussions with the IMF for a larger and extended programme.
However, an IMF spokesperson emphasised the organisation’s current commitment to completing the ongoing Stand-by Agreement programme. The Fund, he said, would engage in preliminary discussions for a successor programme following its conclusion.
The finance minister also stressed the importance of striking a balanced approach in Pakistan’s trading relationships with the United States and China amid their trade war. He hoped Pakistan could sustain positive relations with both countries despite their rivalry.
The minister also emphasised the government’s dedication to carrying forward the structural reform programme initiated by the previous administration.
As part of the programme, Pakistan is privatising underperforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including Pakistan International Airlines, the national flag carrier.
Mr Aurangzeb reiterated the government’s objective to go ahead with privatisation and accomplish it by the end of June.
He added that if the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines is successful, other state-owned enterprises could undergo a similar process.
Meeting with Saudi minister
On Tuesday, Finance Minister Aurangzeb also met his Saudi counterpart, Mohammad Al-Jadaan.
A statement released by the Pakistani embassy conveyed that the Saudi finance minister reaffirmed support for Pakistan’s economic growth, including through investments. Both sides agreed to enhance bilateral cooperation and broaden the partnership across various sectors.
At the IMF headquarters, Mr Aurangzeb participated in the G-24 finance ministers and central bank governors’ meeting. He acknowledged the support the IMF and the World Bank provided to Pakistan.
The minister’s team said that he “talked about reforms in the areas of taxation, energy, privatisation, and digitalisation”.
He also “underlined the need to bring in more private sector investment and leverage the Adaptation Fund to help the country deal with adverse impacts of climate change”.
US State Dept
Meanwhile, the US State Department welcomed last month’s announcement that the IMF has reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan.
“We understand that the Pakistani Minister of Finance is in town here in Washington for meetings at the IMF and World Bank. Pakistan has made progress in stabilising its economy, and we support its efforts to manage its daunting debt burden,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.
“We encourage the government to prioritise and expand economic reforms to address its economic challenges. Our support for the country’s economic success is unwavering, and we will continue to engage with Pakistan through technical agreements as well as through our trade and investment ties, all of which are priorities of our bilateral relationship,” he said.

5,Middle East on edge after Israel vows ‘response’ to Iran,"Putin, Erdogan join list of world leaders calling for restraint; US warns of further sanctions on Tehran.","

JERUSALEM: Israel and Iran traded threats on Tuesday after Tehran’s first-ever direct attack on its arch-foe sharply heightened regional tensions as the Gaza war ground on with no truce in sight.
Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Iran would not get off “scot-free” after Iran launched a barrage of over 300 missiles, drones and rockets at Israel at the weekend.
“We cannot stand still from this kind of aggression,” Hag­ari said, a day after Israel’s mil­itary chief vowed there would be “a response” to Iran’s offensive.
Iran said its attack was an act of self-defence following a deadly Israeli air strike on its consulate in Syria and that it would consider the matter “concluded” unless Israel retaliated.

Putin, Erdogan join list of world leaders calling for restraint; US warns of further sanctions on Tehran

Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi warned that “the slightest action against Iran’s interests will definitely be met with a severe, extensive and painful response”.
Israel weighs options
Israel was weighing its options after the Iranian drone and missile onslaught, which caused little damage as Israeli defences intercepted most projectiles, helped by US, British and French forces, as well as regional allies.
It remained unclear when Israel might strike and whe­ther it would target Iran dir­e­ctly or attack its interests or allies abroad, including in Leb­anon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
Israel made its first official comment on Monday on the strike that levelled a five-storey Iranian consulate building on April 1, killing seven Ira­nian Revolutionary Guards, including two generals.
“These were people who engaged in terrorism against the State of Israel,” Hagari said.
Calls for restraint
Meanwhile, world leaders have urged restraint and de-escalation.
During a phone call with Raisi, Russian President Vladimir Putin called on both sides to “show reasonable restraint and prevent a new round of confrontation,” the Kremlin said in a readout of the call.
He warned that further escalation in the Middle East could have “catastrophic consequences”.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that Israel’s Netanyahu and the Israeli leadership are solely responsible for the recent escalation of tensions.
“Israel is trying to provoke a regional conflict, and its attack on Iran’s embassy in Damascus was the last drop,” he told a press conference in Ankara after a cabinet meeting.
He added that new regional conflicts were possible as long as the “cruelty and genocide” in Gaza continued, and called on all parties to act with common sense.
In a statement, Portugal’s foreign ministry also urged de-escalation in the Middle East.
A day ago, US President Joe Biden stressed that “the United States is committed to Israel’s security” and wants to prevent the conflict from spreading.
Washington, Israel’s top ally and arms supplier, has made clear it will not join Israel in any attack on their common adversary Iran, a senior US official said.
More sanctions
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called on 32 countries to impose sanctions on Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and their missile programme.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who will head to Israel on Tuesday, urged the European Union to impose sanctions on Iranian drone technology.
“I campaigned in late autumn together with France and other partners within the European Union for this drone sanctions regime to be extended further,” she said, adding she also wanted it to cover “other missile technologies in Iran’s arsenal”.
“I hope that we can now finally take this step together.”
Also on Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned of further sanctions targeting Iran, saying she expects Washington will take added action “in the coming days.”
“I fully expect that we will take additional sanctions action against Iran in the coming days,” she said as this week’s spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank began in Washington.
The Treasury, Ms Yellen said, will not hesitate to work with US allies to “use our sanctions authority to continue disrupting the Iranian regime’s malign and destabilizing activity.”
