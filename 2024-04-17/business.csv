0,"Pakistan to grow at 2pc, face 25pc inflation: IMF",Lender lifts global growth forecast to 3.2pc this year.,"ISLAMABAD: Notwithstanding a relatively better global outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday maintained Pakistan’s economic growth prospects for the current fiscal year at two per cent, which it had revised downward in January from its previous estimate of 2.5pc.
In its flagship World Economic Outlook (WEO 2024), released on Tuesday, the IMF kept the country’s growth rate at 3.5pc for the next fiscal year. In January, the Fund had lowered the current year’s growth rate by 0.5pc from 2.5pc and by 0.1pc from 3.6pc for FY25, which it anticipated in October 2023.
 
 

The growth estimates are based on the Fund’s recent quarterly review of Pakistan’s macroeconomic position as part of the $3bn Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) on which the two sides reached a Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) on March 20.
The IMF forecast is slightly higher than projections made by its Washington-based cousin — the World Bank — at 1.8pc early this month. The IMF’s growth forecast is significantly lower than the government’s 3.5pc GDP growth target for the current year but generally in line with the State Bank of Pakistan’s expectation of 2pc to 3pc announced last month as part of the Monetary Policy Statement.

Lender lifts global growth forecast to 3.2pc this year

The IMF estimated that Pakistan’s average inflation will decelerate to 24.8pc this year from 29.2pc last year and further slow to 12.7pc in FY25. Also, the Fund projected the current account deficit increasing to 1.1pc of GDP this year from 0.7pc last year and rising further to 1.2pc next year.
On the other hand, the IMF estimated that the unemployment rate would gradually decline from 8.5pc in FY23 to 8pc this year and 7.5pc next fiscal year.
Raises global growth
In the WEO report, the IMF raised the global growth rate for 2024 to 3.2pc, 0.1pc higher than its 3.1pc forecast of January and significantly higher than its October forecast of 2.9pc. “The forecast for 2024 is revised up by 0.1bps from January and by 0.3bps from October 2023”.
The pace of expansion is low by historical standards, owing to both near-term factors, such as still-high borrowing costs and withdrawal of fiscal support, and longer-term effects from the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; weak growth in productivity; and increasing geo-economic fragmentation.
The WEO expected the global headline inflation to fall from an annual average of 6.8pc in 2023 to 5.9pc in 2024 and 4.5pc in 2025, with advanced economies returning to their inflation targets sooner than emerging market and developing economies. The latest forecast for global growth five years from now — at 3.1pc — is at its lowest in decades. The pace of convergence toward higher living standards for middle- and lower-income countries has slowed, implying persistence in global economic disparities, the IMF said.
The relatively weak medium-term outlook reflects lower GDP per person growth stemming, notably, from persistent structural frictions preventing capital and labour from moving to productive firms. It noted that dimmer prospects for growth in China and other large emerging market economies will weigh on the prospects of trading partners, given their increasing share of the global economy.
“Risks to the global outlook are now broadly balanced”, the IMF said but noted on the downside that new price spikes stemming from geopolitical tensions, including those from the war in Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza and Israel, could, along with persistent core inflation where labour markets are still tight, raise interest rate expectations and reduce asset prices.
A divergence in disinflation speeds among major economies could also cause currency movements that put financial sectors under pressure. High interest rates could have greater cooling effects than envisaged as fixed-rate mortgages reset and households contend with high debt, causing financial stress. “In China, without a comprehensive response to the troubled property sector, growth could falter, hurting trading partners”, the WEO warned.
Moreover, amid high government debt in many economies, a disruptive turn to tax hikes and spending cuts could weaken activity, erode confidence, and sap support for reform and spending to reduce risks from climate change. Also, geo-economic fragmentation could intensify, with higher barriers to the flow of goods, capital, and people implying a supply-side slowdown.
 
 

On the upside, looser fiscal policy than necessary and assumed in projections could raise economic activity in the short term, although risking more costly policy adjustments later on. Inflation could fall faster than expected amid further gains in labour force participation, allowing central banks to bring easing plans forward. Artificial intelligence and stronger structural reforms than anticipated could spur productivity.
The IMF advocated the near-term priority for central banks to ensure that inflation touched down smoothly, by neither easing policies prematurely nor delaying too long and causing target undershoots as the global economy approached a soft landing.
At the same time, as central banks take a less restrictive stance, a renewed focus on implementing medium-term fiscal consolidation to rebuild room for budgetary maneuver and priority investments, and to ensure debt sustainability, is in order.
“Multilateral cooperation is needed to limit the costs and risks of geo-economic fragmentation and climate change, speed the transition to green energy, and facilitate debt restructuring”, the WEO said.

1,Large-scale manufacturing sector grows for third month in Feb,"Index drops 0.51pc in July-February, its 20th cumulative fall in a row.","ISLAMABAD: The quantum of large-scale manufacturing (LSM) rose 0.06 per cent in February, its third increase in a row, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday.
The quantum index of LSM industries was 126.01 points in February compared to 125.93 in the same month last year.
However, the index for the month was 4.14pc lower than for the previous month, Jan­­uary 2024, when it stood at 131.45 points.
 
 

The annual change in the LSM index has been mostly positive since August 2023, when it rose 0.26pc. Before that, the index was down for 13 consecutive months.

Index drops 0.51pc in July-February, its 20th cumulative fall in a row

The removal of import restrictions, clearance of outstanding letters of credit and improved dollar liquidity following improvement in the State Bank’s foreign exchange reserves are considered to help pick up economic activity.
As for this fiscal year’s first eight months (July to February), the large-scale manufacturing index fell 0.51pc year-on-year to 117.99 points. The PBS data showed that the cumulative change in the index was in the negative for the 20th month in a row, i.e. since July 2022.
During July-February, 11 of 22 sectors witnessed positive growth, including food, beverages, wearing apparel, leather, wood products, coke and petroleum products, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, rubber products, machinery and equipment, and furniture.
According to the Finance Ministry Econo­mic Outlook for March 2024, the LSM cycle usually follows the cyclical movements in the main trading partners.
However, since it is focused on the main industrial sectors and not on total GDP, it is somewhat more volatile than the cyclical component of GDP in Pakistan’s main export markets.
The economic situation in the major export markets has improved and is currently above the neutral 100 benchmark. In Pakistan, the seasonally adjusted LSM output in February 2024 remains above the neutral benchmark, indicating a cyclical revival in large-scale manufacturing output.
Despite the domestic downside risks for the industrial sector such as high input cost and high policy rate, the cyclical component of LSM recorded above the potential level for the months of December and January of the ongoing fiscal year.
It is expected that this positive trend will continue in the upcoming months and LSM will post a modest growth as compared to fiscal 2023.
In the textile and clothing sector, positive growth was observed in yarn (3.44pc) and cloth (0.64pc) in February from a year ago.
However, a massive growth of 18.74pc was recorded in the garment sector in February from a year ago.
In the food group, wheat and rice production posted a negative growth of 0.51pc in February over the same month last year. The production of cooking oil rose 7.69pc while vegetable ghee saw a decline of 13.32pc during the month.
Petroleum products posted a negative growth of 16.85pc in February, mainly because of a decline in all products. In February, iron and steel production declined by 1.43pc. However, electrical equipment increased by 2.09pc.
The production of fertilisers experienced a surge of 33.14pc, while the production of rubber items grew 10.63pc. The production of pharmaceutical products experienced a significant surge, with an increase of 9.96pc. The manufacturing of machinery and equipment saw a growth of 28.98pc.
According to finance ministry report, the performance of the auto industry during July-February remained subdued due to massive increases in inputs prices and tightening auto finance.
Car production and sale dropped 40.8pc and 40.9pc, while trucks and buses production and sale decreased 50.6pc and 48.7pc, respectively. However, tractor’s production and sale increased by 68.6pc and 67.6pc.
Sales of total petroleum products dropped 13pc to 10.2 million tonnes during the eight-month period compared to 11.7m tonnes a year ago.
The total cement dispatches (domestic and exports) were 30.56m million tonnes, 2.5pc higher than in the year-ago period.

2,"Gold shines at new peak near Rs250,000 per tola","Retail price of chakki flour still hovering at Rs160-170 per kg while it should be below Rs135 per kg, says head of wholesalers' group.","KARACHI: A $20 per ounce jump in world gold rates on Tues­day pushed the local 10-gram and one-tola prices to new all-time highs of Rs214,077 and Rs249,700, respectively, up Rs2,057 and Rs2,400 from Monday.
As per rates issued by the All Sindh Saraf and Jewellers Association (ASSJA), the international gold price swelled to $2,391 per ounce, an all-time high amid escalating tension after the Iranian attack on Israel.
The massive increase in domestic gold rates might create problems for families that had opted to wait to buy finished jewellery sets and ornaments after Eidul Fitr, as the marriage season begins after Ramazan.
 
 

Market analysts offered a different views whether people are investing in gold or testing other investment options amid fear of further price hikes, given geo-political tensions.
“Some people in Pakistan are investing in gold and trading in the yellow metal futures at the Pakistan Mercantile Exchange,” said Topline Securities Ltd Chief Executive Mohammad Sohail, adding that large amounts of savings are also going into bank deposits and fixed-income funds generating close to 20pc return these days.
Pak Kuwait Investment Comp­any Ltd Head of Research Samiullah Tariq said real estate has been a major investment avenue due to higher historic returns.
Retailers charging high flour prices
Huge wheat imports further brought down the flour no. 2.5 prices to Rs104 from Rs106 per kg before Eidul Fitr, while they were at their peak of Rs124 per kg in February.
“The wheat flour rate has plunged below the commissioner Karachi’s wholesale and retail rates of Rs123 and Rs128 per kg, respectively,” Karachi Whole­salers Grocers Group Chairman Rauf Ibrahim said, urging the commissioner to issue updated lists as retailers are fleecing the consumers based on higher official rates.
“After the price reduction, the price of naan and chapati should drop to Rs15 and Rs10 per piece,” he said, asking the commissioner to take notice of higher prices of bread and bakery products despite a declining trend in flour rates. Naan sells at Rs25-30 per piece, while chapati is available at Rs15-18.
He said the retail price of chakki flour is still hovering at Rs160-170 per kg while it should be below Rs135 per kg.
Mr Rauf said the fine and super fine flour varieties are being retailed at Rs145-160 per kg, thus challenging the government’s writ in the retail market segment.
Pakistan Flour Mills Assoc­iation (PFMA), Sindh Zone, Chairman Aamir Abdullah said the millers had reduced the 10kg bag of wheat flour to Rs978 from Rs1,070 before Rama­zan, while it was Rs1,250 in February.
He said the ex-mill rate of flour no.2.5 has been slashed to Rs97 per kg from Rs124 in February.
He said maida (superfine flour) and fine flour prices had been fixed at Rs132 and Rs135 per kg compared to Rs138 and Rs141 before Ramazan.
Since September 2023, the private sector has imported around 3.2 million tonnes of wheat from Russia and Ukraine at lower international prices, and the rupee appreciation has further reduced its landed cost.
Mr Aamir said the price of imported wheat has dropped to Rs8,000-8,700 per 100kg bag from Rs10,800, while local wheat is available at Rs8,900 vs Rs9,500.

3,"Cement bags must carry making, expiry dates: Comp­etition Commission of Pakistan",Says cement’s hygroscopic nature makes it susceptible to strength loss after 4-6 weeks of storage.,"ISLAMABAD: To enhance consumer protection and ensure transparency, the Comp­etition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has pr­o­posed amendments to the Pakistan Stan­dard Specification for all five types of cement.
In a policy note issued on Tuesday, the CCP has recommended a mandatory disclosure of manufacturing and expiry dates on cement packaging.
Highlighting the significance of this recommendation, the CCP pointed out that cement’s hygroscopic nature makes it susceptible to strength loss after 4 to 6 weeks of storage. The absence of manufacturing and expiry dates on cement bags poses a consumer risk. It could lead to the purchase of expired products and compromise the integrity of construction projects.
The policy note emphasises the need to align Pakistan’s standards with international labelling practices to ensure consistency and transparency in the domestic market. It also aims to address the disparity between domestic and export labelling requirements, thereby safeguarding the interests of local consumers.
Currently, all types of cement in Pakistan adhere to packaging standards set by the Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA).
The introduction of mandatory manufacturing and expiry date disclosures is expected to empower consumers, foster competition among brands, and streamline inventory management processes.
The CCP condemns the omission of material information on cement packaging as deceptive marketing and advocates for the mandatory printing of expiry dates to protect consumer interests and promote fair competition within the industry. An advisory has been sent to the All Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association (APCMA) and its members, urging compliance with the new labelling requirements to prioritise consumer safety and satisfaction.
Unpaid marking fees 
It may be worth mentioning that during a previous meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and Technology, it was revealed that the cement industry had not paid the marking fee to the PSQCA for the past 15 years, resulting in outstanding dues of over Rs4.5bn as of June 2022.

4,Rupee falls 17 paise against US dollar,"""Minor fluctuations have no significance,” says a currency dealer.","KARACHI: The rupee struggled to remain firm on Tuesday, but the US dollar appreciated in the interbank market for the second day in a row.
The State Bank of Paki­stan (SBP) reported the dollar gained 17 paise to settle at Rs278.29 compared to Rs278.12 a day before. The greenback appreciated by 18 paisa on Monday.
“The exchange rate is stable. The minor fluctuations have no significance,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market. He said the exchange rate was being managed, and there was no trading in the interbank market; only the rate was opened at a higher level.
The exchange rate has been stable for the last three months, with the rupee slightly increasing. Now, it has reversed in favour of the US dollar. However, the fluctuations could not destabilise the exchange rate required for the economy and foreign investments.
A financial team led by Pakistan’s finance minister is currently in Washi­ngton for talks to secure a new loan from the Inter­national Monetary Fund.

5,Stocks snap five-session record-breaking spree,Analyst says index closed in red due to institutional profit-taking amid uncertainty over outcome of IMF talks.," 


KARACHI: Bulls tossed the benchmark index above the 71,000 barrier for the first time in the history of the Pakistan Stock Exch­ange (PSX) on Tue­sday, but the market came under selling pressure, snapping the five-day record-breaking spree amid uncertainty about the outcome of talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
In the preceding session, the index scaled an all-time high on prevailing optimism about the Saudi investment package as a high-level delegation led by the kingdom’s foreign minister arrived last night to expedite the investment commitments.
However, Ahsan Meha­nti of Arif Habib Corpo­ration said the index closed in the red due to institutional profit-taking amid uncertainty over the outcome of IMF talks for a new bailout programme and mounting geopolitical tensions.
He said the IMF conditions for tax policy reforms proposing excise duties on industrial units, weak glo­bal crude prices and a slump in global equities dampened investor sentiments.
Topline Securities Ltd said throughout the session, the index displayed a mixed performance.
As a result, the benchmark KSE 100 index hit an intraday record high of 71,092.61, gaining 548.03 points, and a low of 70,405.24, losing 139.34 points. However, it closed at 70,483.66 points after losing 60.92 points, or 0.09pc from the preceding session.
Sectors like oil and gas marketing, power generation, fertiliser, and cement contributed to the index’s negative movement. Comp­anies including Fauji Ferti­liser Company, Engro Ferti­l­isers Ltd, PSO, Hub Power, and Fauji Cement Company collectively shed 146 points.
However, Habib Bank Ltd, Bank Alfalah Ltd and Ma­ri Petroleum contri­bute­d positively, adding 189 points.
The overall trading volume fell 1.22pc to 548.41 mi­l­lion shares. The traded value also dipped 4.33pc to Rs21.03bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom Ltd (91.61m sha­res), Kohinoor Spinning Mills Ltd (34.39m shares), Air Link Communication Ltd (19.98m shares), K-Ele­ctric Ltd (18.87m shares) and Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (16.25m shares).
The companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs47.97), Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (Rs35.96), Hinopak Motors Ltd (Rs16.61), Philip Morris Pakistan Ltd (Rs15.00) and Al-Abbas Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs10.00).
