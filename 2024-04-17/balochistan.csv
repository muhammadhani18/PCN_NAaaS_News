1,Cleanliness drive starts in ICT schools,Official says it aims to cultivate a sense of civic responsibility among students,"The Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training Pakistan has launched the ‘Starting Cleanliness’ initiative in ICT government schools to create awareness and cultivate a sense of civic responsibility among the students.
Information Secretary Mohyuddin Wani inaugurated the drive on Wednesday. “I am excited to announce the launch of the initiative in ICT government schools. I commit to participating in a daily cleanliness campaign in one school,” he said, adding that it was essential to lead by example, involving both ourselves and the students in maintaining a clean environment.
The information secretary said that education is being fused with civic responsibility to maintain cleanliness on school premises. Effective immediately, every government school and college will mandate participation in campus cleaning activities for both staff and students.
The ministry officials will visit two schools daily to oversee implementation. On Wednesday, Wani visited G62 School and joined the clean-up campaign. “Moving forward, my weekly participation is now compulsory. Together, we aim to shift the mindset of both students and teachers towards cleanliness and responsibility,” said Wani.

2,‘Workplace diversity an invaluable asset’,"American diplomat presses for equity, accessibility, inclusion in hiring","Equity, accessibility, and inclusion in hiring and the workplace should be a cornerstone principle for any organisation, business, and government.  Ensuring all employees have the tools and resources to succeed in the workplace benefits us all.
These remarks were made by US Ambassador to Pakistan Donal Blome at the PUAN Accessibility and Inclusion Job Fair and Fifth Khadija Tul Kubra Awards Ceremony held in the federal capital.
Ambassador Blome said this is because our jobs are not just a means to earn a living and care for ourselves and our families. 
“When we find a career we are passionate about, we are dedicating our time, energy, and skills to a larger mission. We help our communities grow and prosper and we offer irrefutable proof that diversity in the workplace is an invaluable asset.”  
He further said these are principles we live by at the US embassy and in our consulates throughout Pakistan.
“The United States truly believes in the skills and talents of Pakistan’s people, and we look forward to taking advantage of STEP and PUAN’s great efforts today – and in the future – to ensure we are recruiting new team members with inclusion and accessibility in mind.”
Donald Blome also congratulated the award recipient.  “Collectively, you pioneered new ways to think about and advocate for mental healthcare, accessible public facilities, local and national policy recommendations, and much more,” he added.

3,Privatisation of public schools begins,"Under first phase, six primary and girls schools will be privatised in district Rawalpindi","The Department of Education has started to privatise government schools under the Public Private Partnership.
In the first phase, tender offers have been invited for the privatisation of 25 government schools across the province, including 11 government schools of the Rawalpindi division.
All government schools included in the first phase are primary and girls schools. All these schools will be given in public-private partnership under the Punjab Education Initiative Management Authority (PEIMA). Applications for these have been sought from interested parties till April 24. However, teachers' organisations have rejected the privatisation of schools.
Among the educational institutions to be given by the government authorities to the private sector, six are in district Rawalpindi, four in district Chakwal, one in district Attock, three in district Bahawalpur, three in district Rahim Yar Khan, two in district Khushab and one school in each of the districts of Bahawalnagar, Dera Ghazi Khan, Gujarat, Lodhran, Rajanpur and Sargodha.
After the completion of the first phase, a list of 100 schools has been made for the second phase, while another 5,000 government schools will be handed over to the private sector from June 1 to August 14 during the summer vacation.
Punjab Teachers Union Secretary General Rana Liaquat Ali said that the privatisation of government schools is nothing but a disaster for the education system. The chief minister should reconsider this decision, he said, adding that at present, there are 122,000 teachers’ seats vacant in government schools and recruitment should start immediately. “Teachers should not be forced to take to the streets.”
Muhammad Shafiq Bhalwalia, Central Secretary General of the Punjab SES Teachers Association said that by handing over government schools to PEIMA, PEEF and NGOs in a phased manner, education will become expensive. According to the Constitution of Pakistan, the state is bound to provide free education to every child from class I to class 10.
District President of the Educators Association Basharat Iqbal Raja said that by increasing the cost of education, poor and middle-class children will be completely deprived of education.
The education department sources said the 25 schools will be handed over to PEIMA by the second week of May.
