Addressing a press conference, he said street crime in the city was increased during the caretaker government, but the situation was being improved due to the effective measures taken by the Sindh government.
He said that street crime was a global  issue. 
“According to the International Crime Index, Karachi ranks 78th  out of 333 cities in various countries,” he said, adding that the  situation of street crime in the US cities such as Oakland, New Orleans,  Chicago, Phila­delp­­hia, Atlanta, Houston, San Francisco, and Washington  was worse than that in Karachi.
He said that the street crime situation in Paris was worse than in Karachi as per the International Crime Index.
To a question, he said that illegal immigrants in the province posed a  significant and long-standing challenge as some of them were found  involved in various incidents. “The government is earnestly working to  address this issue,” he said, adding that the provincial government had  demonstrated a strong commitment to maintaining law and order.  
Mr Memon, who holds portfolios of information, transport, and excise, taxation and narcotics control ministries, also highlighted the pervasive drug problem in Pakistan, emphasising the dangers of synthetic substances like crystal and ice which impaired cognitive function.
He noted that even parents had fallen victim to the influence of those drugs.

Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the post-mortem examination of Moiz Naseem was carried out by a board of four doctors in the presence of a judicial magistrate.
Dr Summaiya herself led the four-member board comprising Dr Kamran, Dr Osama and Dr Sono Mal.

2,High diagnosis cost barrier to haemophilia control in country,"Despite passage of one year, Sindh govt yet to approve summary for free treatment of 50 young patients.","• Despite passage of one year, Sindh govt yet to approve summary for free treatment of 50 young patients
• World Haemophilia Day today            
KARACHI: While the world is observing Haemophilia Day today, the federal government remains far behind from addressing the challenges of bleeding disorders in the country as around 70 per cent of patients remain undetected thanks to lack of facilities at public sector hospitals and high cost of diagnosis at private labs, it emerged on Tuesday.
Often described as an orphan disease, haemophilia had no official ownership as haematology departments at most public sector tertiary care hospitals were either non-existent or dysfunctional and the diagnosis of the disease in the private sector was beyond the reach of ordinary people.
Resultantly, they said, around 70 per cent of the patients remained undetected and suffered the disability.
About the disease prevalence and diagnosis cost, Raheel Ahmed of the Haemophilia Welfare Society Karachi (HWSK) — the only organisation in the country formed and led by the people with bleeding disorders — said there were an estimated 80,000 patients with bleeding disorders in Pakistan, out of whom 30,000 were haemophilia patients.
The monthly treatment cost of a patient ranges between Rs300,000 and Rs1.7 million, depending on the severity of the blood disorder, whereas the cost for diagnosis is between Rs25,000 and Rs150,000.
‘Only 1,200 registered patients’
“We estimate that there are around 10,000 haemophilia patients in Sindh. Of this number, only 1,200 are registered,” Mr Ahmed of HWSK said.
He said that the organisation was managing the medication cost of the 1,200 registered patients with the help of World Federation of Haemophilia and private donations.
According to him, around 200 new patients are annually registered with the organisation that has also set up Pakistan’s first treatment centre for haemophilia patients last year.
“We need an annual budget of Rs1.8 billion to treat all affected children adequately. Besides, there is an acute shortage of medicines, which the government should address,” he said.
Sindh govt yet to okay treatment of 50 patients
The sources said that the Sindh government was yet to approve a summary pertaining to the treatment of 50 haemophilia patients registered with the HWSK.
They said that even after one year the summary, duly signed by the then health minister and health secretary, couldn’t find its way to the Chief Minister’s House for final approval.
“During meetings we had with the health department last year, it was decided that the provincial government would offer its financial support for treatment of 50 patients in the first stage and then gradually extend it to over 200 patients, aged between one and 12 years,” Mr Ahmed said.
He added that the government released only Rs24m last year that covered treatment cost of only six patients. “We have raised our voice at multiple forums for release of funds but to no avail,” he said. 
According to the US Centres of Disease Control and Prevention, haemophilia is usually an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly.
This can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding following injuries or surgery. Blood contains many proteins called clotting factors that can help to stop bleeding. People with haemophilia have low levels of either factor VIII or factor IX.
The severity of haemophilia that a person has is determined by the amount of factors in the blood. The lower the amount of the factor, the more likely it is that bleeding will occur which can lead to serious health problems.

However, he said that all these facilities were assets of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and would be taken back from them come what may. 
According to a statement issued by the mayor office, the mayor chaired a meeting at the KMC Sports Complex to review the status of city parks, playgrounds and other recreational facilities. 
“Let me assure the people of Karachi that the KMC would regain control of all these facilities and make them available for the public,” the statement quoted the mayor as saying. 
He said the KMC was not earning a single penny from these occupied facilities despite the fact that the rent of all these occupied public spaces should be paid to the municipal body.

4,Murad approves Rs14.7bn for K-IV project,WB and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to bear remaining 80pc cost of Rs74bn scheme,"KARACHI: Chief Minister (CM) Syed Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday approved Rs14.7 billion as 20 per cent share from the Sindh government for the Rs74bn Augmentation Project of the much-awaited Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply Scheme, commonly known as K-IV, and directed the planning and development department to start the process of hiring consultants for the project.
The Augmentation Project is one of the components of the K-IV to be carried out by the Sindh government and funded by 40pc each from the World Bank (WB) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and 20pc by the provincial government. However, it has been pending final approval from the federal government since March 2022.
The Executive Committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec) had in Aug 2023 conditionally approved the PC-1 of the K-IV Project, that also included Rs74 billion K-IV Augmentation Project, asking the provincial government to give justification of Rs40bn increase in the cost. In response, the provincial government on Feb 13, 2014 submitted its revised compliance report giving the justification.
A statement issued from the CM House said that while approving Rs14.7bn as provincial government’s share, the CM was told that no-objection certificates (NOCs) for the K-IV Augmentation Project works were being sought from 12 federal and provincial agencies for identification and relocation of their systems. 

WB and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to bear remaining 80pc cost of Rs74bn scheme

He directed the local government minister and Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation to pursue them for the issuance of the NOC.
Mr Shah said he would talk to Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal to expedite the pending K-IV project. 
Meanwhile, expressing concern over the impact of climate change on water scarcity, the CM said it could be addressed by introducing a new cropping pattern that included low delta crops aimed at reducing water consumption and increasing efficiency in agriculture.
Presiding over a joint meeting of the irrigation and agriculture departments, he said that during the Kharif season-2024, water shortage was expected to increase by 30 per cent, but it could be more acute, therefore, the agriculture sector would suffer.

5,"Media’s role in image building, economic development discussed","Art of producing entertaining, engaging content is for those who know their audience, moot told","KARACHI: Speakers at a programme on Tuesday highlighted the role of media in image building and the country’s economic development and stressed the need for introducing reforms in the entertainment industry in order to make it a global soft power.
They were speaking at a discussion — Role of Media in Development of Economy — during the Pakistan Media Summit jointly organised by the Karachi Film Society at Habib University.
Speaking on the occasion, CEO of Hum Network Duraid Qureshi said Pakistan needed to work on its entertainment industry as that would play a role of ‘soft power’ globally and would not only improve the country’s image but also its economy.
He said Hollywood and Bollywood were multi-million dollars industries whereas Korean dramas and films had also made impressive progress.

Art of producing entertaining, engaging content is for those who know their audience, moot told

He said Pakistan was lagging far behind despite the fact that its dramas were of high quality and admired across the border.
Economist and writer Dr Ishrat Husain said the media had a very influential and constructive role in the image building and, by that, the economic development of a country. 
However, he added, biases and prejudices were common nowadays at most TV channels and their ultimate victims were good governance and the country’s economy.
He said economy was dependant on markets, and for markets to function efficiently, correct and timely information was important and that unverified or unauthentic information made participants of market reluctant.
“But the situation at present is bad as negative and fake news are common now,” he said, adding that there were multiple success stories in the country but those, too, were not highlighted.
Entrepreneur Ameen Hashwani said Renaissance in Europe had also come about through art and culture and the same role would film, dramas, music and other artistic productions would play for Pakistan’s economic revival.
He also said that among other things, the media had a very important role in holding politicians and businesses accountable and thus help keep the economy running in a better way.
Prominent industrialist Arif Habib said the image of Pakistan was portrayed more negative than positive and because of that, investors saw a risk in Pakistan while doing business. 
Businessman Ehsan Malik said that the media was a powerful tool for building narratives and, therefore, a lot of positive work was needed to be done in that regard.
Systems Limited CEO Asif Peer said the problem the country faced was brand building. “If there’s no brand building, there’s no trust. And we don’t even exploit properly the best things that we have,” he said and added that that would open gates for business in Pakistan.
All the panellists stressed the need for critical reforms in the country’s media and entertainment industry.
‘Digital media will be the future’ 
In another session titled ‘Potential of Digital Media in Pakistan’, the panellists said with the world rapidly moving towards digitalisation, it is almost impossible to escape the monster called content creation. 
They said the art of producing media, which is both entertaining and engaging, is not for the people who do not know their audience, and there is a dire need of massive investment when it comes to digital media.
At the session, Faizan Syed, founder and CEO of a digital advertising agency, asked the audience to share their screen time since he wanted them to first understand what digital media actually is. Then he asked them what their top three apps were. 
“The penetration of media has changed the landscape,” he remarked after the activity.
The panellists — Javed Jafri of Unilever Pakistan, Jehan Ara of Katalyst Labs and Farhan Khan of Brainchild Communications —agreed that the content consumption, be it in any form, depends upon how well one knows their audience.
“The views are monitored when it comes to TV and other mediums, however we still don’t monitor digital mediums properly, hence the numbers are not accurate but I can tell you that the market is really huge, and we need hacks to properly utilise it,” Mr Khan said.
When questioned about the divergent fates of startups, Ms Jehan Ara said: “The art lies in knowing the need and the audience. Your business should cater to some sort of need of the people and then of course, strong marketing is also a factor. But knowing your audience changes the entire game.”
The panellists further delved into how an average person in the country spends seven to eight hours on road, and while they’re at it, they’re scrolling their phone screens instead of consuming any other form of media. 
They also talked about how the present form of media is going to expand further and digital media will be the future only if it’s understood and utilised properly.

6,Owners asked to display legal details outside under-construction buildings,KARACHI: With illegal constructions and making of unauthorised multiple floors over a small piece of land continued...,"KARACHI: With illegal constructions and making of unauthorised multiple floors over a small piece of land continued unabated across the city, the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) has come up with another idea to enforce its laws.  
The SBCA has decided to make it mandatory for builders to make all relevant details of their construction activities and projects public by placing a ‘board’ inscribed with QR codes outside the respective structure displaying all legal information.  
Although the fresh move was announced by the SBCA on Tuesday amid much media fanfare, sources privy to the affairs of the authority said that the same orders from the authority had been issued in 2019 which were never implemented.  
“The SBCA has taken a decisive action to tackle the proliferation of illegal constructions within the city by issuing a notification to affix QR codes on all under-construction residential and commercial buildings, complete with detailed information,” said a SBCA statement citing the notification issued by its director general Abdul Rasheed Solangi.  
“The notification mandates the placement of plot numbers, date of approval, nature of building, number of floors approved, SBCA licences, and contact details of building owners and contractors at the site of under-construction buildings. The DG SBCA has emphasised that the provision of details on such buildings will facilitate easy access to information for the public regarding the number of floors in a building and whether the construction is approved or not.” 
The SBCA chief, it said, had also warned that the action would be taken against those buildings which would not comply with these requirements.  
The fresh move, the SBCA claimed, would help people to countercheck the legality of any under-construction project before making any final decision.  
“The DG SBCA has highlighted that by scanning QR codes on boards placed on all approved under-construction residential and commercial buildings in Karachi, people can easily determine the legal status of a building using their smartphones. This initiative will not only empower citizens but also assist authorities in identifying illegal constructions,” added the statement.  
Although the SBCA chief sounded confident that this move would bear fruit for the general public, many believe that the fresh orders were a kind of replica of a 2019 move when the then chief of the authority, Zafar Ahsan, had issued similar orders making them mandatory for every builder.  
“Mr Ahsan’s action was a move towards reforming the operational side of the authority but he hadn’t only faced resistance from within the authority but the orders were hardly followed by builders,” said an official sharing history of such moves.  
Both the officials and builders were not sure as to how such moves would help stop illegal structures when such activities, many believe, are always carried out with the support of the officials concerned.  
The fresh orders from the SBCA chief came a couple of days after he approached all deputy commissioners of the city asking them to launch a crackdown on illegal constructions in their respective areas.  
“The DC concerned will ensure proper implementation of the Sindh Building Control Ordinance, 1979, and recommend further action against such illegal buildings and delinquent officers involved in unauthorised constructions under the SBCA Rules accordingly,” said the DG SBCA letter.

7,Schoolchildren faint after inhaling generator fumes,"KARACHI: Students of a school in Hijrat Colony, Lyari, fell unconscious after being exposed to exhaust fumes ...","KARACHI: Students of a school in Hijrat Colony, Lyari, fell unconscious after being exposed to exhaust fumes produced by a generator on Tuesday.  
According to details, 22 students of a private school in Sector-2 fainted as a result of being exposed to the fumes.  
The generator was running during loadshedding in the area. Fumes from its exhaust filled into the classrooms resulting in the unfortunate incident.  
On discovering the children’s condition, the school authorities reached out to first responders who provided first aid and took the children to hospital.  
Following the incident, the Directorate of Inspection and Registration of Private Institutions of the School Education and Literacy Department of the government of Sindh imposed a penalty on the school.  
After visiting the school to inquire about the incident, the officials of the directorate found that the students had fainted because the school classrooms lacked ventilation.  
It prevented the fumes from escaping, which constitutes gross negligence on the school’s part.  
Thereby the school was slapped with a penalty of Rs1,330,000 (2,660 days multiplied by 500, which equals to 1,330,000) to be deposited as challan within seven days of receiving the letter from the Directorate of Inspection and Registration of Private Institutions.  
Additionally, the school was also told to provide an explanation of their failure to renew its registration as well as negligence that resulted in the fainting of so many children.  
It was also revealed during the inspection that the school registration was last renewed in February of 2014 and had expired in January 2017.  
The school did not apply for a renewal of registration after its expiry.  
As a result, the school has been operating illegally since 2017, which is punishable by law.  
According to the Sindh Private Educational Institution (Regulation and Control) Ordinance “... whoever runs an institution in contravention of the provisions of the Ordinance or Rules shall be punished with imprisonment, which may extend to one year or with fine, which may extend to Rs500.”

The town’s social workers and growers, Khalid Arain, Shahjahan Shah, Jameel Arain, Ghulam Rasool Mugheri and others complained to local media persons that the minors supplying water to their town were running dry due to ongoing rotation programme for Nara Canal, hence no water for reservoirs of the town’s water supply network.
They said the town had been grappling with acute shortage of water for past few weeks and attributed the problem to unabated theft of water being committed by big landlords in connivance with corrupt irrigation officials, who were supplying the already scarce commodity to farmlands at the expense of humans.
They claimed that armed henchmen of big landlords in connivance with corrupt irrigation officials had stopped water supply to tail-end of Buggi minor near Dajero Mori with the help of a tractor. No one dared intervene and even officers concerned were avoiding action against the culprits, they said. 
They demanded Sindh chief minister, secretary of irrigation, director of Nara Canal and others ensure supply of water was resumed to the minor without further delay and legal action was taken against the landlords and their henchmen involved in this serious crime.

11,SHRC wants more funding for Sir Cowasjee mental health facility,"HYDERABAD: The Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC), following its inspection team’s March 20 visit to the Sir...","HYDERABAD: The Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC), following its inspection team’s March 20 visit to the Sir Cowasjee Jehangir Institute of Psychiatry, has urged the provincial health secretary to pay due consideration to its recommendations, primarily increased budgetary allocations, to help the institute overcome its “critical deficiencies”.
SHRC Chairman Iqbal Detho, in a communication to the secretary on Tuesday, said that the inspection team headed by him had visited the institute with the overarching objective of scrutinising conditions and standards of mental health services at this facility.
The inspection team felt that there was a pressing need for concerted efforts to address the challenges being faced by this healthcare facility. The critical deficiencies included shortage of staff, infrastructure, patient services and budgetary allocations which required immediate attention.
The commission urged the health secretary to prioritise resource allocation and expedite recruitment process to address the issues.
The SHRC has attached its inspection report with the communication and suggested that health department should pay due consideration to six key areas mentioned under subtitles like staff shortage and infrastructure deficiencies; implementation of holistic patient care initiatives; vocational and non-formal education; establishment of old-age home facility; strengthening of support services for vulnerable patients and legislative advocacy; and compliance for drafting rules of implementation of the Sindh Mental Health Care Act-2019. Some of these measures are supposed to be taken by health department in consultation with culture and law departments, Sindh technical education authorities and Nadra.
‘A unique institution’
According to the inspection report, the Sir Cowasjee Jehangir Institute of Psychiatry is a unique institution dedicated to provision of mental healthcare services. With a multidisciplinary team of mental health professionals comprising psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and psychiatry nurses, the institute strives to deliver evidence-based interventions tailored to cater to the needs of each patient.
Despite being such a unique institution, the mental healthcare facility faces myriad challenges in fulfilling its mandate effectively. From staff shortage to infrastructural limitations, it grapples with countless obstacles that impede its ability to provide optimal care and support to individuals in need for rehabilitative nature. As an integral component of mental healthcare landscape in Sindh, the institute plays an indispensable role in safeguarding health and well-being of community.
Elaborating the six specified areas, the commission suggested that vacant positions must be filled by prioritising recruitment of psychiatrists urgently and to chalk out clear strategies to attract and retain qualified professionals, besides recruiting lower-grade workers. It suggested partnerships with academic institutions, teaching hospitals and professional bodies.
It stressed allocation of adequate funds for the procurement of ambulances and essential medical equipment. It also called for a maintenance plan for the existing infrastructure. 
The commission advised culture department to introduce a patient care programme featuring indoor recreational activities and music therapy to support patients’ rehabilitation and well-being. 
For vocational and non-formal education of patients, the SHRC suggested, a partnership could be established between the hospital and the Sindh Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (Stevta).
The commission is of the view that a separate building should be established for the under treatment elderly and senior citizens. 
It has proposed effective implementation of the Sindh Mental Health Act-2019 and its rules for the rights and welfare of individuals with mental health disorders. It said that relevant authorities and stakeholders should be engaged to expedite adoption and implementation of legislative reforms aimed at improving mental healthcare services.

The protesters’ leaders Saindad Joyo, Anees Junejo, Liaquat Brohi and others told reporters that incidents of exchange of fire between rival groups in the middle of the bazaar had become almost a routine where police remained silent spectator. 
Many warring tribes, they said, had chosen this area to settle their old scores and freely engaged in exchange of fire in the market, which naturally affected their businesses.
They said that a pedestrian woman died after a stray bullet hit her when Vessar and Brohi tribesmen traded fire in the market a few days back. In another incident in Eid night, trade of fire between Jalbani and Vessar clans left two persons injured, they said, adding on Monday again, Vessars and Jalbanis exchanged fire in Resham Gali. 
The protesters demanded elected representatives Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Faryal Talpur, Larkana DIG and SSP set up permanent police pickets in the market to check the miscreants so that traders could carry on their business with peace of mind. 
They urged the government and influential persons of the area to end ongoing disputes between different tribes and clans.

Police had produced him in the court on April 13 to seek his remand in police custody but Consumer Protection Court judge declined the police’s request and accepted the suspect’s bail for Rs35,000, he said.
He said that since the suspect was not cooperating, police also needed to have his medical examination done by an authorised medical officer so as to assess his state of mental health. Therefore, he contended, the court should allow the suspect’s remand in police custody and recall his bail order. 
The court issued notice to the suspect on the SHO’s application and asked him to appear before the judge on April 22.
