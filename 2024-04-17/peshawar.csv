1,Govt withdraws private secretaries from four ex-CMs,Move comes in line with cabinet’s decision,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Tuesday withdrew official private secretaries from four former chief ministers, who had been working with them for many years.
According to a notification issued by the establishment department, the private secretaries were withdrawn from former chief ministers Pir Sabir Shah, Sardar Mehtab Ahmad Khan, Amir Haider Khan Hoti and Pervez Khattak in line with a decision taken by the provincial cabinet on March 8.
Among them was Syed Haris Shah, who had been working with Pir Sabir Shah as the private secretary since 1994. He was sent back repatriated to his parent irrigation department.
Private secretary Ubaidullah Saleem, who had been working with Sardar Mahtab since 1999, was posted to the establishment and administration department against the vacant post.
Khadim Hussain, the private secretary to Haider Hoti, was repatriated to the establishment department, while Ali Hassan Qureshi, who worked with Pervez Khattak as the private secretary on deputation, was repatriated to the elementary and secondary education department.

Move comes in line with cabinet’s decision

The government decided in its first meeting to withdraw the perks and privileges of the province’s former chief ministers.
“As a poor country, we can’t afford to provide perks and privileges to former CMs. All these facilities, including guards and government vehicles, are being taken back [from them] here,” Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur told reporters after his cabinet’s maiden meeting on March 8.
REPLY SOUGHT: The Peshawar High Court on Tuesday sought a reply from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to the plea of former chief minister and chief of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-Parliamentarians Mahmood Khan against the withdrawal of official guards from him by the government.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Attique Shah and Justice Syed Arshad Ali issued the order after preliminary hearing of a petition filed by Mr Mahmood requesting the court to declare the withdrawal of security from him illegal.
Senior lawyer Shumail Ahmad Butt appeared for the petitioner and said his client had served the province as its chief minister and was now heading his political party.
He added that current Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, after assuming his office, ordered the withdrawal of security from all his predecessors.
“Chief Minister Gandapur declared that the former chief ministers should hire private security guards for themselves and the security won’t be provided to them at the government’s expenses,” he said. 
The lawyer said in the past, a chief minister was entitled to two security personnel, which was later on increased to eight personnel.
Justice Arshad wondered whether deputing eight security guards for an individual won’t be in excess and a burden on the exchequer.
Mr Butt contended that provision of security to former chief executives of the province was necessary as they’re politicians and there were threats to their lives.
Justice Shah observed that in that case, the sessions judges, commissioners and deputy commissioners would also needing security.
He added that the sessions judges had been performing much tougher job, then they would need more security.

6,PHC seeks details of cases against PTI leader Aslam Iqbal,PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court on Tuesday sought details from the federal and provincial governments and their law...,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court on Tuesday sought details from the federal and provincial governments and their law enforcing agencies of the cases registered against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader  and a member of the Punjab Assembly, Mian Mohammad Aslam Iqbal, within a week.
A bench consisting of Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Sahibzada Asadullah directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to also provide information about the cases or inquiries against the petitioner, Aslam Iqbal, who has sought directives of the court for the government about details of the cases related to him.
The petitioner’s counsel, Ali Azim Afridi, requested the bench to grant interim pre-arrest bail to his client in cases about which they had so far not been provided any information.
Let the government first submit the details after which the bench would decide whether to grant him bail in those cases or not, the bench observed.
The counsel stated that the petitioner belonged to Punjab and had also remained a provincial minister. He added that the petitioner was an MPA and scores of cases had been registered against him after May 9 and 10 protests.
He stated that most of these cases were registered on political grounds for victimising the petitioner.
He stated that the petitioner now wanted to approach the relevant court to get relief but for that purpose he needed to know about the cases pending against him.
Mr Afridi stated that the petitioner apprehended that he would be arrested on way to the court concerned.
Additional Attorney General Sanaullah Khan objected to the petition and contended that he belonged to Lahore and he should have approached the court there.
He questioned how could the petitioner approach this high court when cases pertained to other provinces.
The bench observed there was nothing to hide in providing information about cases against the petitioner.
When the bench inquired from Mr Afridi whether the petitioner was present in the courtroom, he replied that he was busy in marriage ceremony of his daughter on Monday night due to which he could not turn up in the case. He assured that he would appear on next date.
He stated that earlier after the Feb 8 polls the high court had granted protective bail to the petition in 18 of the cases against him. He added that now they wanted to know about any other cases against him of which he had no knowledge.
MNA CASE: A bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Syed Arshad Ali issued notice to the federal government seeking its response to a petition of PTI leader and MNA Ali Khan Jadoon challenging placement of his name on the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL) by the FIA.
The bench directed the government to submit its reply within seven days.
Advocate Afridi appeared for Mr Jadoon and contended that the petitioner was an MNA elected in the Feb general elections.
He stated that after the May 9 protests the petitioner was placed on the PNIL due to which he couldn’t travel abroad.
He argued that the court had already granted bail to the petitioner in cases registered against him and keeping his name in the list was illegal and unconstitutional.

They said the police had bound the traders to install the security cameras at their shops and commercial centres to keep close watch on criminals and anti-state elements amid looming terror threat.
The sources said a majority of cameras installed by the traders in the past had gone out of order but shopkeepers did not bother to get them repaired.
The sources said footages from CCTV cameras had helped police trace a number of theft and car-lifting cases. They said it had been decided that the police would give the shopkeepers a month to either repair the faulty cameras or install new ones.
The sources said all the SHOs had been directed to ensure each trader in their jurisdiction installed CCTV cameras, ad in case of failure, lodge cases against them.
When contacted, a police official told Dawn that the businessmen who failed to get installed security cameras within the given time would face action. “This policy is aimed to strengthen the monitoring system, prevent any untoward incident and trace those who indulge in heinous crimes,” the official said.

11,Probe finds poor checking at security posts ahead of Bisham bus bombing,It also points out lack of coordination among law-enforcement agencies,"SHANGLA: Police investigations have revealed that poor car checking at security posts and a lack of coordination among law-enforcement agencies led to the March 26 Bisham bus bombing that killed five Chinese workers and the Pakistani driver, say officials.
They told Dawn that the explosive-laden car that targetted the bus of Chinese workers reached Bisham from Balochistan’s Chaman area 10 days before the terrorist attack. The officials shared with Dawn the footage of CCTV cameras installed on the road from Shangla Top to the Bisham Maira area.
The video recording showed that the car entered Shangla by the Shangla Top in Alpuri tehsil early on March 15.
The car travelled through Chakdara in Malakand district and Swat district before crossing all checkpoints in Shangla district. It crossed around 30 police checkpoints from Chakdara to Bisham, according to the footage.

It also points out lack of coordination among law-enforcement agencies

A senior police official told Dawn that the bombing’s planners were also involved in the July 14, 2021, suicide attack on the bus carrying Chinese workers of the Dassu hydropower project in Upper Kohistan district.
Chinese nationals are working on most of the energy and other projects being executed in the region under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor initiative.
A police official in Bisham told Dawn that the explosive-laden car was parked by the bomber’s facilitator at a filling station in the Shaga Maira area of Bisham on March 15 after the payment of Rs500 a night before both the bomber and his facilitator left for the Oghi area in Mansehra district.
He said the CCTV cameras installed at the filling station were out of order, and therefore, the movements of both terrorists couldn’t be filmed.
The official said the guard and the owner of the premises had been taken into custody for interrogation. He said Hazrat Bilal, the prime suspect in the attack, belonged to the Jag Dubair area of Lower Kohistan but currently lived in the Oghi area of Mansehra district.
The official said that the suspect was involved in the 2021 Dasu attack and was a close aide to Tariq alias Button Kharab, the planner of terrorist attacks from Afghanistan.
Senior officials of the counter-terrorism department told Dawn that all planners and facilitators of the Bisham bombing had been traced with the help of a SIM card, and they were based in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.
They said more arrests were also expected in the days ahead.
The officials saidMohammad Shafiq, a government Class-IV official, Wajid, from the Kohistan region, facilitated the March 26 Bisham suicide attack.
They said the car drove past the Bisham police station at 6:17am on March 26 that stood 3.5 kilometers from the blast site, while the two Chinese buses crossed that point at 12:49pm and reached the Lahore nullah at 01:01pm before being hit by the slow-moving explosive-laden car.
The investigators said the car moved between Bisham and Pandiar checkpoints, which bordered Kohistan, for eight hours, waiting for the Chinese convoy to show up.
They insisted that the bomber’s facilitator stayed in contact with an attack planner over the phone until the mission was accomplished.
A police officer in Bisham insisted he wrote a letter to his top bosses, insisting that the Chinese security officials never asked the police for help or informed them about the movement of their convoys.
He also said Chinese nationals worked in Kohistan, but the region’s police or intelligence officials didn’t share anything about the movement of those foreigners.
The government has already suspended RPO of Hazara region Ijaz Khan, DPO of Upper Kohistan Suliman Khan, DPO of Lower Kohistan Jamil Akhtar and Dasu project security officer over the “failure of security coordination” after the Bisham bus bombing.
A staff member of the Dasu Hydropower Project told Dawn that Chinese engineers and workers travelled to and from Islamabad in buses every two days via the Karakoram Highway, but arrangements for their security were never changed.
He, however, said the security of Chinese workers and the buses carrying them was significantly improved after the Dasu attack.
“Four to five security vehicles used to follow the buses with Chinese workers aboard,” he said.
When contacted, district police officer Imran Khan said no check posts in Shangla had scanners. He said police officials manually checked cars at all entry and exit points.
A senior law-enforcement officer told Dawn that there should be proper coordination among police, law-enforcement agencies, and Wapda and Chinese security officials, as well as proper vehicle examination at security checkpoints after the Dasu attack due to the vulnerability of Chinese workers.
“It is essential to change vehicles, routes, and bus timings, and even security vehicles should follow each of the buses instead of following both buses from front and back,” he said.

They said Faqir Eppi played an important role in imparting both religious and formal education to Pakhtun children. He also stressed the need for development and prosperity of Pakhtuns.
They, however, regretted that Pakhtun nation was intentionally kept ignorant about the glorious past of their heroes, whose achievements were not included in the textbooks.

They stressed the need for awareness about the glorious achievements of all the Pakhtun nationalist leaders, while also demanding legitimate share in the natural resources and befittingly remembering their past leaders.

14,Senior health officials face punitive action over ‘poor’ performance,Secretary formally asks them all to mend ways,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department has expressed displeasure over the “poor” performance of heads of several public sector hospitals, district health offices, public health programmes and the health services academy in the province and warned them of disciplinary action over failure to mend their ways.
They include medical superintendents of 24 district headquarters hospitals and tehsil headquarters hospitals, 10 district health officers, two project directors, and the director-general of the health services academy, according to a letter issued by health secretary Mahmood Aslam Wazir to them.
The secretary directed them all to ensure effective resolution of the health issues facing people.
Sources at the health secretariat told Dawn that those officers were formally told in the past as well to address the complaints lodged by people about poor healthcare with the provincial Management Reforms Unit at the offices of the chief secretary, but compliance with those instructions wasn’t up to the mark. They said the chief secretary conveyed his displeasure over the matter to the health secretary and directed him to look into it.

The sources said the performance of the officers in question was found to be “below 50 per cent.”
In the letter, the health secretary said the performance of those officers was dissatisfactory and therefore, they should improve it through “drastic steps” to benefit patients.
He warned that noncompliance with his orders would lead to necessary action under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) E&D Rules, 2011.
The secretary asked the DHOs of Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank, Upper Chitral, Charsadda, Mansehra, Karak, Upper and Lower Kohistan, Kolai-Palas, Bannu, North Waziristan, and Hangu districts to address people’s complaints at the earliest.
Similar directions were issued to the medical superintendents of DHQ hospitals of Lakki Marwat, Landi Kotal in Khyber, Miramshah in North Waziristan, Karak, KDA in Kohat, Mardan, Swabi, Bajaur and Battagram, tehsil headquarters hospitals of Booni and Drosh in Chitral, Kulachi in Dera Ismail Khan, Samarbagh in Lower Dir, Tangi in Charsadda, Chakdara in Lower Dir, and Sarhad Hospital for Psychiatric Diseases, Government Naseerullah Khan Babar Memorial Hospital and Moulvi Ameer Shah Memorial Hospital in Peshawar, Category D Hospital in Havelian of Abbottabad, Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Teaching Hospital in Abbottabad, Category D hospital of Pacha Kalay in Buner and Mian Rashid Hussain Shaheed Memorial Hospital in Pabbi of Nowshera.
The secretary also showed “deep concern over the dissatisfactory performance” of the director-general of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Services Academy Peshawar, the project director of the provincial TB Control Programme and the director of the Independent Monitoring Unit and asked them to improve it to prevent punitive action.
Sources told Dawn that most complaints were lodged by hospital visitors with the citizen portal of PMRU about medicine shortages, the absence of doctors and other staff members, dereliction of duty by those on duty, and out-of-order equipment.
They added that the complainants did so only after their requests to the relevant DHOs for better facilities in hospitals and other centres fell on deaf ears.
