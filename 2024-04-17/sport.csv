Greek actress Mary Mina, playing the role of high priestess, lit the torch using a backup flame instead of a parabolic mirror that is normally used, due to cloudy skies, in the 2,600-year-old Temple of Hera, near the stadium where the Olympics were born in 776 BC, for the start of a relay in Greece and France. 
It will culminate with the lighting of the Olympic flame in the French capital at the opening ceremony. Paris will host the summer Olympics for a third time after 1900 and 1924. 
“In these difficult times we are living through, with wars and conflicts on the rise, people are fed up with all the hate, the aggression and negative news they are facing day in and day out,” International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said in his speech. 
“We are longing for something which brings us together, something that is unifying, something that gives us hope. The Olympic flame that we are lighting today is the symbol of this hope.” 
The IOC has cleared the way for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete at the Olympics despite the ongoing war in Ukraine but they will do so as neutral athletes with no national flag or anthem, a decision that angered Moscow. 
French President Emmanuel Macron also said last week Russia would be asked to observe a ceasefire in Ukraine during the Paris Olympics. The Kremlin said Ukraine might use it as an opportunity to regroup and rearm. 
Suspending armed conflicts under an Olympic truce during the Games was a standard practice in ancient Greece. 
“In ancient times, the Olympic Games brought together the Greek city states, even — and in particular — during times of war and conflict,” Bach said. 
“Today, the Olympic Games are the only event that brings the entire world together in peaceful competition. Then as now, the Olympic athletes are sending this powerful message: yes, it is possible to compete fiercely against each other and at the same time live peacefully together under one roof.” 
Carrying the flame in a pot, the high priestess lit the torch of the first runner of the relay, Greece’s Olympic rowing champion Stefanos Ntouskos. 
After a short run he then handed the flame on to France’s three-time Olympic medallist in swimming and head of Paris’ Olympic torch relay, Laure Manaudou, as the representative of the host city. 
The torch harks back to the ancient Olympics when a sacred flame burned throughout the Games. The tradition was revived in 1936 for the Berlin Olympics. 
During the 11-day relay on Greek soil, some 600 torchbearers will carry the flame over a distance of 5,000 kilometres (3,100 miles) through 41 municipalities. 
The flame will be officially handed over to Paris Games organisers in Athens’s Panathenaic stadium, site of the first modern Games in 1896, on April 26. 
It will then depart the next day for France on board a three-masted ship, the Belem where it will arrive on May 8 in Marseille, with up to 150,000 people expected to attend the ceremony in the southern city’s Old Port. 
The last torch bearer in Marseille will climb on the roof of the Velodrome stadium on May 9, organisers said. 
Marseille, founded by the Greek settlers of Phocaea around 600 BC, will host the sailing competitions. 
The French torch relay will last 68 days and will end in Paris with the lighting of the Olympic flame on July 26.  
Officials on Tuesday stressed that the Paris Games will set new milestones, following the legacy of the other two prior Olympics held in the French capital. 
“The Olympic Flame will shine over the first Olympic Games inspired by our Olympic Agenda reforms from start to finish,” Bach said. “These Olympic Games will be younger, more inclusive, more urban, more sustainable. These will be the very first Olympic Games with full gender parity, because the IOC allocated exactly 50 percent of the places to female and male athletes.” 
Paris Olympics chief organiser Tony Estanguet noted that women took part for the first time in the Paris 1900 Games, while the first Olympic Village was created for the 1924 Paris Games. 
For the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic imposed toned-down events for the 2020 Tokyo Oly­mpics and 2022 Beijing Winter Games, the ceremony was back with full regalia and scores of spectators. 
Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, French sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo werep resent at the ceremony. 
American mezzo soprano Joyce DiDonato delivered the Olympic anthem.

1,‘World Athletics’ prize money at Games goes against Olympic spirit,"The decision, announced by WA President Sebastian Coe last week, took other international federations by surprise.","ANCIENT OLYMPIA: The decision by World Athletics to award prize money at the Paris 2024 Games goes against the Olympic spirit and solidarity among international federations, the head of cycling’s global governing body (UCI) said on Tuesday.
Athletics became the first sport to offer prize money to Olympic champions when WA President Sebastian Coe announced last week that gold medallists in Paris will each earn $50,000.
The decision took other international federations by surprise.
“We really believe that this is not the Olympic spirit,” UCI President David Lappartient told reporters on the sidelines of the Paris Olympics torch lighting ceremony.
“The proposal [by World Athletics] was not discussed. It was [announced] on the day of our mother organisation’s meeting. It should have been on the agenda,” he added.
“The Olympic spirit is to share revenues and have more athletes compete worldwide. Not only put all the money on the top athletes but spread the money.
“If we concentrate money on top athletes, a lot of opportunities will disappear for athletes all over the world.”
The announcement by WA was met with a positive reaction from the world’s leading athletes, with the $2.4 million prize pot to be split among the 48 gold medallists in Paris.
A total of $540 million was allocated to the 28 sports events at the previous Games in Tokyo with World Athletics receiving the most at $40 million.
“We need to ensure we will have athletes tomorrow,” said Jean-Christophe Rolland, who heads World Rowing.
“I fully respect the World Athletics decision as long it concerns athletes from their sport but at the Olympic Games it is not about your sport but all sports. I would appreciate if we had the discussion between us.
“This decision impacts not only athletes. It has other implications.”
Lappartient and Rolland are not the first ones to be critical of the move, with Britain’s five-time Olympic rowing champion Steve Redgrave calling it an unfair decision to other sports that cannot afford to do the same.

2,"No guarantees Babar will play full New Zealand series, says head coach Azhar","“We could definitely rest Babar, but it depends on the situation, anyone can be rested,"" he says."," 

PAKISTAN cricket team head coach Azhar Mehmood gestures during a press conference at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Tuesday.—Tanveer Shahzad/White Star

RAWALPINDI: There are no guarantees that Pakistan captain Babar Azam will play all five matches of the upcoming Twenty20 International series against New Zealand, the national side’s head coach Azhar Mahmood has said.
Azhar was appointed in the role on a temporary basis, with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) looking to finalise a foreign coach to eventually replace the former all-rounder.
The 49-year-old, however, echoed the selection policies set by the PCB, which involve rotation of players to manage their workload as well as giving game time to the less experienced yet promising players to strengthen the side’s bench with the T20 World Cup less than two months away.
“We could definitely rest Babar, but it depends on the situation, anyone can be rested,” Azhar told reporters during a press conference here at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Tuesday. “However, we’ll see according to the conditions what game plans we can come up with.”
An able batter and a decent pacer in his days, Azhar noted Pakistan’s matches against New Zealand and the following series against Ireland and England — a total of 12 — will be used to identify the best combination ahead of the T20 World Cup.
“In this time ahead of the World Cup, we are looking to create a structure, a game plan and give players clarity in their roles, which always help with improvement,” the head coach observed. “We have a lot of young talent in the squad and we have to see them, to identify our bench strength. We will try to make use of it, the aim is to field the best XI when we play our first T20 World Cup game on June 6.”
The PCB’s seven-member selection committee’s rotation policy in effect has kept all options open for Azhar and his coaching staff to decide how to use each player’s strengths and that would apply on the opening slots as well, which have been occupied by Babar and Mohammad Rizwan for most of the last four years.
Pakistan have a number of players to choose from for the top order, including the likes of Saim Ayub, Fakhar Zaman and Usman Khan.
“We haven’t decided who will open the innings,” Azhar said. “Anyone can play on any number. In T20, only the top three batters have to have to know their numbers, the rest can adjust according to the situation.”
The options down the order are also ripe, boosted by the return of veteran pacer Mohammad Amir and seasoned all-rounder Imad Wasim — both rescinding their respective retirements from international cricket last month.
“I’m very satisfied with the squad, it covers almost all aspects of the game,” said Azhar. “It’s a balanced side, we have two all-rounders and the fast bowling line-up is also very strong.
“The return of Amir and Imad gives us an edge and we can use them at any point. The batting line-up has got the best available talent right now.”
Azhar, who recently won the HBL Pakistan Super League for Islamabad United as head coach, said that data suggested New Zealand — apparently depleted by the absence of their top players due to their participation in the ongoing Indian Premier League — were still a formidable side.
“Although we will not be competing against a full-fledge New Zealand team, this is still their best available talent,” he noted. “If you crunch the data and the stats, you’d know all these players have done really well in domestic cricket and in New Zealand.
“This [Pakistan series] will be a good opportunity for these players to knock on the doors for selection in the T20 World Cup. No team can be ruled out as a weak side in the T20 format.”
New Zealand batter Mark Chapman echoed Azhar’s views, saying that while his side is “missing couple of [main] players, we have an exciting and a talented team.”
Chapman added that for the second-string Kiwis, the Pakistan series was a very good opportunity for them to put their hands up. The left-hander expected that the series, which starts Thursday here, will be an exciting affair.
The 29-year-old said his team-mates were wary of Pakistan’s pace battery — which now includes Amir — and that they were “aware about skills he possesses”.

3,Opening ceremony on Seine ‘very probable’ option,PARIS: The Paris Olympics’ chief organiser Tony Estanguet said on Tuesday an opening ceremony on the river Seine...,"PARIS: The Paris Olympics’ chief organiser Tony Estanguet said on Tuesday an opening ceremony on the river Seine was the  “very probable” option, after French President Emmanuel Macron said it could be moved to a stadium.
“Today, the really main and very probable plan is to organise the ceremony on the Seine,” Estanguet told RFI. “The president was very clear yesterday. The main objective is to achieve a very beautiful, absolutely unique opening ceremony, the first time that it will be held outside a stadium, in the centre of Paris on the Seine.”
In an interview on Monday, Macron said France was looking forward to putting on the unprecedented ceremony in which teams will sail down the Seine, but that contingency plans were in place in the event of a security threat to the event.
He said the ceremony on July 26 could be  “limited to the Trocadero” across the Seine from the Eiffel Tower and — for the first time — Macron said it could even be moved to the Stade de France, the national stadium.
“There are Plan Bs and Plan Cs, we are preparing them in parallel... 
We will analyse this in real time,” Macron said.
Estanguet, who was attending the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, Greece, said:  “All of our energy and all of the means at our disposal are being employed to make this very beautiful ceremony a success.
“In parallel to that, we are looking at all the contingency plans to adapt to the context, because that is our responsibility. Depending on the situation we’re in at the time, we will adapt the project.”
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo suggested she was surprised by Macron’s suggestion that the ceremony could be moved.
“The only plan I know is Plan A,” Hidalgo said. 
“The message I prefer to send is that we are ready and we are going to welcome the world.”

4,Manchester City dreaming about double treble as Real Madrid come to town,"""We want to create the legacy,"" says City midfielder Bernando Silva."," 

MANCHESTER: Phil Foden (R) of Manchester City controls the ball next to Bernardo Silva during a training session at the Manchester City’s training ground on Tuesday.—AFP

MANCHESTER: Manchester City players are motivated by the possibility of winning an unprecedented second consecutive treble as they prepare to host Real Madrid on Wednesday with a place in the Champions League semi-finals at stake.
Last season, Pep Guardiola’s men became just the second club in English history to win the treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup — 24 years after neighbours Manchester United achieved the feat.
As the finishing line of the 2023/24 season approaches, they are two points clear at the top of the Premier League with six games to go and face Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals this weekend.
City drew the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final with Real 3-3 at the Bernabeu ahead of the second leg at the Etihad, having overcome the 14-time European champions in the semi-finals last season on their way to winning the competition for the first time.
“Obviously, it is an inspiration and motivation,” City midfielder Bernando Silva told reporters on Tuesday. “We want to create the legacy. We want four Premier Leagues in a row. We want the Champions League twice in a row and two trebles in a row. In one week we could be out of all the competitions. But we are fighting.”
City are playing Real in the knockout stages of the Champions League for the third successive season.
After defeat in 2021/22, Guardiola’s side demolished the Spanish giants last season with a stunning 4-0 second-leg victory at the Etihad.
City’s result in the first leg is not as spectacular as it would have been in the era of away goals, but they are now favourites to make a fourth consecutive semi-final thanks to a fearsome record on home soil.
The holders have not lost in 30 Champions League games at the Etihad, dating back to 2018, and are unbeaten in 41 matches in all competitions at home since November 2022.
But Guardiola cautioned against dreaming too far ahead.
“I am not going to say ‘don’t feel this’ to my players, but I have a different opinion. We are far away from those hypothetical dreams,” Guardiola told reporters.
“When we are in the final of the FA Cup and two or three games [remaining] in the Premier League and in the final of the Champions League I will start to think about that. I started to think of the treble last season only when we beat Manchester United in the FA Cup final.”
Former Barcelona player and manager Guardiola said he relished once again facing old rivals Real, who have an eight-point lead at the top of the La Liga standings.
“Always has been and always will be [a big game],” he said. “It’s Real Madrid and in this competition it is always a big game. It’s special for me. Of course it is.”
ARSENAL SEEK TO SILENCE DOUBTERS
City’s Premier League rivals Arsenal, meanwhile, face a potentially season-defining Champions League clash against Bayern Munich on Wednesday as familiar doubts simmer over whether they can handle the pressure after their damaging defeat by Aston Villa.
Sunday’s 2-0 loss brought back uncomfortable memories for Mikel Arteta’s side, who led the way for most of last season before buckling in the home straight, allowing Manchester City to overtake them.
Long-suffering fans fear the worst again, with City now top of the pile once more and favourites to seal an unprecedented fourth straight top-flight title.
Until Sunday’s reverse, the Gunners had convinced many that they were the real deal, adding grit to style as they went on a rampaging run of 10 wins in 11 Premier League matches.
Now Arsenal, who have never won the Champions League, travel to the home of Bayern with little time to lick their wounds, targeting their first semi-final in the competition since 2009 after last week’s first leg at the Emirates ended 2-2.
Bayern have a slight edge over Arsenal given their rich history in the competition, but they still have to be at their best to beat them, coach Thomas Tuchel said on the eve of the second leg.
Bayern have not gone beyond the quarters since winning their sixth European Cup in 2020 and the pressure will be on Tuchel’s team at the Allianz Arena as Europe is their only chance of redemption in a season where they have been dethroned as German champions by Bayer Leverkusen.
“We have a slight advantage when you look at our experience in this competition. But to turn it into a real advantage, you also need a top performance. We’re ready to give it everything we’ve got,” Tuchel told reporters on Tuesday.
“We’ll need everything again. We’ll need passion and the same tactical discipline as in the first leg. We really want to win this game. It’ll be extremely important that every fan comes to support and push us.”
Bayern are staring at a first trophyless season since 2012 but striker Harry Kane believes his side still have a chance of a “great season” by winning the Champions League.
“It’s no secret here that the club sets out to win the Champions League every season,” the 30-year-old told reporters. “You know, from the club’s point of view, it will be a failed season if we don’t win anything this year because we’re expected to win. We still have the opportunity to turn the season into a great season if we win the Champions League.”

6,Nadal wins  on injury comeback at Barcelona Open,BARCELONA: Rafael Nadal made light work of Flavio Cobolli on a triumphant return from injury at the Barcelona Open ...,"BARCELONA: Rafael Nadal made light work of Flavio Cobolli on a triumphant return from injury at the Barcelona Open on Tuesday.
The 22-time Grand Slam champion had not played an ATP Tour match since January but dispatched the Italian 6-2, 6-3 in one hour and 25 minutes to reach the second round.
Nadal, 37, was able to play on clay for the first time since winning the French Open in 2022 and showed flashes of his usual brilliance in a solid display.
“It was a good start — when you return you can’t get rid of the doubts in one day, above all, on a physical level,” Nadal told TVE.
“Within what it could be, it was a good first round. He made mistakes and I think I played the game that I had to play.”
Nadal who has triumphed at Roland Garros a record 14 times, is hoping to play there in May in what he expects to be the final year of his professional career.
“It will be at a speed that I don’t know if I will be able to keep up with, but I’ll try,” Nadal said of facing the 11th-ranked De Minaur.
After a double fault to fall 30-0 behind Nadal found his rhythm, with Cobolli intimidated by the fervent support for the Spaniard on the court named after him.
Nadal converted his third break point in the fourth game for a 3-1 lead, with Cobolli surviving four more to hold at 4-2 down.
The 12-time Barcelona Open winner broke again to claim the set in 43 minutes, clenching his fist in celebration.
Cobolli handed Nadal a break for 2-0 in the second set with two more unforced errors but finally put some pressure on Nadal’s serve in the third game to break back.
However Nadal broke again for 3-1 after Cobolli’s third double fault and served it out to triumph.
The Spaniard did not produce any aces and his serve was effective but not explosive.
“I’ve gone months without being able to serve, (and) although I’ve got a lot of excitement to play here and do the best I can, I’m not going to go crazy with the serve,” added Nadal. “I have to serve with caution that the moment I’m in dictates... there are moments in which I feel 
more liberated and others in which I’m more careful.”

The big-hitting all-rounder has scored just 32 with the bat in six games.
“I think now is actually a good time for me to give myself a bit of a mental and physical break, get my body right,” the 35-year-old Maxwell said. 
“If I’m required to get in during the tournament, I can hopefully get back into a really solid mental and physical space where I can still have an impact.” 
Maxwell said on Monday it was “a pretty easy decision” to step aside for the time being. 
“I went to Faf and the coaches after the last game and said I felt it was probably time we tried someone else,” he said. “I have been in this situation in the past where you can keep playing and get yourself deeper into a hole.” 
Maxwell added: “I take a lot of pride in my performance, and I put in a lot of hard work behind the scenes to get my body right for every game.”

The 21-year-old Palmer underlined his England credentials with a classic left foot, header, right foot treble and then added a second-half penalty as Chelsea ran riot.
Nicolas Jackson and substitute Alfie Gilchrist were also on target as Chelsea remain ninth on 47 points but with games in hand on all the teams above them.
“When we signed him (Palmer) he was a great talent,” Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino said.  “He is doing fantastic, he is doing really well and he has adapted himself. The impact on the team was amazing from day one.”
It was a sobering night for Sean Dyche’s visitors, however, as the heavy defeat leaves Everton 16th on 27 points, two places and two points above the relegation zone.
“A horrid night, miles away from where we want to be,” said Dyche.  “The hard yards, simple tackling, basic principles — all out the window and it was a massive reminder of where we are.”
Everton actually had the first good chance but Beto blasted over from point-blank range after 10 minutes and it was downhill from then on.
Palmer got things moving after 13 minutes when he nutmegged Jarrad Branthwaite, played a one-two with Jackson and instantly clipped in a shot from the edge of the box.
Five minutes later more intricate passing albeit alongside tentative Everton defending set up the second as Jordan Pickford parried a Jackson shot straight to Palmer, who nodded the ball into the empty net.
Pickford also handed Palmer his third goal as the midfielder intercepted a poor clearance 30 metres out and, with his weaker right foot, chipped brilliantly over the retreating keeper after 29 minutes.
Jackson made it 4-0 just before the break and Palmers fourth came from the penalty spot in the 64th minute but only after captain Conor Gallagher had to intervene to shove away Jackson and Noni Madueke as they squabbled for the ball after the latter was brought down in the box.
The calmly-taken penalty took Palmer alongside Manchester City’s Erling Haaland at the top of the league scoring charts with 20 and his tally in all competitions to 23 as he became the first Chelsea player to reach 20 since Eden Hazard in 2018/19.
Pochettino was furious about the penalty taking incident that preceded it, though, apologising for the  “bad image” it sent around the world.
“I made it clear that I won’t accept this again — I promise that,” he said.
Young substitute Gilchrist smashed home the sixth goal in the final minute to leave the Chelsea fans dreaming of Europe, and while it might not be a return to the Champions League they won in 2021, it would still represent progress after they looked marooned in mid-table two months ago.
Everton, in contrast, remain in dire danger of a first relegation since 1951 and face a massive home showdown with fellow strugglers Nottingham Forest on Sunday having seen their goal difference, as well as their confidence, take a hammering.
“We underperformed — the most embarrassed I have felt as an individual,” said centre back James Tarkowski. “It shows where we are at today, we can only apologise to the fans who supported us. It is on the players. It is not on the manager and the staff. No excuses on our behalf. We need to brush ourselves down as we have a big few weeks coming up.”

Gian Piero Gasperini’s side were comfortably leading at half-time following a superb seventh goal in eight matches from in-form Gianluca Scamacca in the 13th minute and Ederson’s simple finish shortly afterwards.
However goals in four second-half minutes from Darko Lazovic and Tijjani Noslin had 17th-placed Verona level on the hour mark and one point above the relegation zone with a host of teams still battling against the drop to Serie B.
Dropping two points at home to lowly opposition damaged Atalanta’s bid for Champions League football.
Atalanta are four points behind fifth-placed AS Roma with a top-five finish almost certain to yield a spot in next season’s revamped edition of Europe’s top club competition.
They will need to pick themselves up for the visit of Liverpool to Bergamo on Thursday.
Atalanta have one foot in the Europa League semi-finals after humiliating Liverpool 3-0 in last week’s first leg at Anfield.
Earlier, Fiorentina were held to a 1-1 home draw by Genoa before the visit of Viktoria Plzen in the Europa Conference League.

Hoelzenbein died on Monday surrounded by his family, the club added in a statement.
Part of the German squad that won the World Cup on home soil, Hoelzenbein won three German Cups with Frankfurt and also the UEFA Cup in 1980, having come through their youth setup.
He scored a club record 215 goals in 532 competitive appearances for Frankfurt between 1967 and 1981.
“Bernd had a huge influence on Eintracht for almost 60 years,” club chief executive officer Axel Hellmann said in a statement.
“He was part of the golden generation of the 1970s, the UEFA Cup win in 1980 and the ‘Football 2000’ era that we as a club played at the start of the 1990s, during which time he was vice-president.
“In Bernd, we are losing not only one of the club’s biggest icons, but also a loyal colleague and a dear friend.”

11,Former Australia batsman Slater refused bail on domestic violence charges,MELBOURNE: Former Australia batsman Michael Slater was refused bail by a court in Queensland state on Tuesday after...,"MELBOURNE: Former Australia batsman Michael Slater was refused bail by a court in Queensland state on Tuesday after being remanded in police custody and charged with multiple domestic violence offences including stalking and intimidation.
Slater, 54, faces 19 charges relating to alleged offences on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast between Dec. 5, 2023 and April 12, a Maroochydore Magistrates Court registrar said.
The charges include unlawful stalking, assault occasioning bodily harm and choking or strangulation.
The court was told Slater denied any allegations of violence against the complainant, News Corp media reported.
The police prosecutor did not provide immediate comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday.
Slater was taken into custody after his bail application was refused and his matter was listed for a committal hearing on May 31.
Australian media outlets reported that Slater, one of Australia’s finest opening batsmen, collapsed in court when Magistrate Raelene Ellis denied his bail application.
He was helped to his feet by prison officers and led away to custody, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation said.
Slater played 74 Tests from 1993-2001 and became a successful cricket commentator before being axed by the Seven Network in 2021.
He has been charged with multiple domestic violence offences in recent years and struggled with mental health issues.
Slater was sentenced to a two-year community corrections order by a Sydney court in late-2022 after pleading guilty to charges including common assault and attempted stalking of a woman.
A community corrections order is a non-custodial punishment in Australia.

12,Spain to decide whether to suspend main candidate to lead RFEF,MADRID: Spain’s government said on Tuesday it will decide whether to suspend the frontrunner to lead the...,"MADRID: Spain’s government said on Tuesday it will decide whether to suspend the frontrunner to lead the country’s football federation (RFEF) while it determines with FIFA how to reform an organisation mired in a corruption scandal.
Jose Manuel Rodriguez Uribes, president of the state-run Superior Council of Sport (CSD), told a parliamentary hearing he had called for a meeting of the CSD board after Spain’s sports tribunal TAD on Monday opened a case against Pedro Rocha and the RFEF’s leadership for  “very serious misconduct” and a criminal court judge advanced a separate investigation over alleged corruption within the federation.
“I have conveyed to (FIFA) our concern and our determination to take every measure to ensure that a reputational crisis such as this can never happen again,” Uribes said in the hearing.
Rocha, who had been acting as the RFEF’s stand-in president and hoped to be annointed permanently in the next month, was placed under investigation by a judge last week after testifying as a witness in court. He was the sole candidate to succeed the former head Luis Rubiales.
“Given the seriousness of what is happening, the reality is that a possible charge of prevarication is on the table against those who sign resolutions that they understand do not respect the legality or the rights of Pedro Rocha,” sources close to Rocha told Reuters.
Spain is trying to turn the page on a series of scandals within the RFEF as it gears up to co-host the World Cup in 2030.
Rubiales and colleagues have been under investigation since June 2022 over potential malfeasance for a deal with former Barcelona player Gerard Pique’s Kosmos firm to relocate the Spanish Super Cup to Saudi Arabia in a deal worth a reported 120 million euros ($129 million).
Rocha was vice president of the federation under Rubiales and head of the financial board when the RFEF signed the Saudi Super Cup deal.
Last month, police searched the RFEF, two executives were fired, prompting world football governing body FIFA and its European counterpart UEFA to request a detailed update on the corruption probe.
Uribes said the government was working to reform its sports laws and create a sanctioning system as well as appointing an ethics committee and an ombudsman to represent sportspersons’ rights.
