1,Court overturns ‘contentious’ election results,Rules in favour of PTI-backed MNA,"Amid jubilant celebrations, Lahore High Court delivered a verdict in favour of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed Member of National Assembly (MNA) from NA 144, prompting supporters to erupt in joy with fireworks and sweet distributions.
In a decisive move, the Lahore High Court bench ruled in favour of the PTI-backed MNA from NA 144, overturning a contentious election outcome that had been shrouded in controversy.
The ruling stemmed from a contempt of court case against the Returning Officer (RO) of Lodharan and the Election Commission, who were summoned on May 2 to face the charges.
As news of the court's decision in Rana Noon's favour reverberated, supporters and workers took to the streets, celebrating with fervour, symbolic of a hard-fought victory.
MNA Rana Muhammad Faraz Noon addressed the jubilant crowd, hailing the court's decision as a triumph of justice, truth, and the people's mandate. His words resonated with the elated supporters, who had fervently backed him throughout the legal battle.

The electoral saga surrounding NA 144 had been fraught with tension and legal wrangling since the general elections on February 8.
Initially, the PTI-backed candidate, Rana Muhammad Faraz Noon, had secured a lead. However, the victory was short-lived as the recount declared the PML-N candidate, Abdul Rehman Kanju, as the winner. This triggered a series of legal manoeuvres, including a stay against the recount obtained by Rana Muhammad Faraz Noon from the Bahawalpur Bench of the Lahore High Court.
Despite the stay, the returning officer of constituency concerned proceeded to issue the victory notification to Abdul Rehman Khan Kanju, leading to Rana Muhammad Faraz Noon's de-notification as the MNA.
The subsequent legal battle saw twists and turns, with appeals and counter-appeals challenging the court's decisions. However, on April 16, the Lahore High Court bench reinstated the decision in favour of PTI MNA Rana Faraz Noon, bringing an end to the protracted legal dispute.
The resounding verdict of the Lahore High Court not only reinstated Rana Muhammad Faraz Noon as the rightful MNA but also underscored the judiciary's commitment to upholding electoral integrity. As supporters rejoiced in the streets, the ruling served as a testament to the enduring spirit of democracy and the rule of law.

3,Opposition threatens to join farmers' protest,Punjab food minister defends wheat procurement policy,"The opposition in the Punjab Assembly came down hard on the provincial government on Tuesday over not purchasing wheat from farmers at a fair price.
The opposition members warned that they would stand by the farmers if they took to the streets in protest against the government’s wheat policy.
The treasury benches had to face embarrassment at several occasions during the proceedings, especially over the absence of the ministers and secretaries of the departments whose business came under discussion.
Senior lawmaker Sami Ullah Khan from the treasury benches also drew the attention of the house towards non-seriousness of the bureaucracy in responding to queries of the members.
Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat, who arrived late, had to apologise over a wrong reply submitted by the department to a query put by treasury lawmaker.
Deputy Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar also expressed his displeasure over the absence of the ministers and secretaries, wondering how progress could be achieved if things remained unchanged. He warned that such behaviour would not be tolerated.
The deputy speaker ruled that the ministers and secretaries whose business was on the assembly’s agenda were bound to be present.
The education minister revealed that the government was going to introduce in the near future a teacher recruitment policy and establish a high school in every union council.
Responding to another question, the minister said around 700 schools were operating in old buildings and the government was making a comprehensive plan to address the issue.
During the discussion on the wheat procurement price, the opposition lawmakers termed the government policy flawed and detrimental to the agriculture sector.
They said the wheat policy would crush the farmers.
The legislators said the wheat should be purchased from farmers at better prices.
If the farmers were not paid adequately, they would stop cultivating wheat, they warned.
Opposition Leader Ahmed Khan Bhachar criticised the government over announcing a decrease in bread prices, depriving farmers of appropriate wheat price and a police raid at the wedding of PTI’s former minister Mian Aslam Iqbal’s daughter.
He said the government had proved itself an enemy of the farmers through its policies. He said the people were being deceived under the garb of relief, adding that on one hand the Roti price had been reduced by Rs4 while on the other hand the petrol price had been increased.
He said the PML-N was going to destroy the agriculture sector through its flawed polices.
The opposition leader warned that there would be a wheat crisis by November and a mafia would purchase wheat at Rs2,500 per maund, which would create severe problems.
He said the opposition strongly rejected the government’s wheat policy and would stand by the farmers if they would come on the roads to protest.
Concluding the debate, Food Minister Bilal Yaseen denied that the government had introduced an anti-farmer policy. He said the government’s purchase rate was Rs3,900, which was the highest in Punjab.
The minister said the wheat harvest in Punjab was higher than other provinces so the government could fix the support price without a problem.
He said purchase of one million tonnes of wheat would not even amount to 10 per cent of the country's produce.
He vowed that the farmers would be protected at any cost and accusing the government of being anti-farmer was incorrect and immature.
He said the government planned to launch a farmer’s card to resolve issues related to fertiliser. Funds were borrowed from banks at the time of wheat purchase but the Eid holidays had delayed the process by a day and the matters had been settled.
Responding the criticism from the opposition, he said the government had sufficient wheat sacks to deal with any untoward situation.
After completion of the agenda, the deputy speaker prorogued the session for an indefinite period.

Speaking exclusively to The Express Tribune, Maryam's father shared poignant memories of his daughter, describing her as a bright soul eager to spend Eid with him in Karachi.
He fondly recalled their plans for fasting and celebrating Eid together, emphasizing Maryam's intellect and education, which surpassed that of her siblings.
Maryam's mother echoed similar sentiments, praising her daughter's friendly demeanour, manners, and sharp intellect.
Muhammad Afzal, her brother, fondly remembered Maryam as the beloved youngest sibling among ten, born and raised in Karachi. She was en route to her village with her young nephew and niece to celebrate Eid when the tragedy occurred.
Her sisters, residing in Karachi's same neighbourhood, adamantly rejected assertions of Maryam's mental instability by railway authorities, labelling them as baseless.
They criticised the authorities for tarnishing Maryam's character instead of probing the brutality she endured. Despite widespread outrage sparked by footage showing a police constable's violent actions towards Maryam, they expressed dismay over the lack of government intervention.
Maryam's untimely demise has prompted her family to question the efficacy of government institutions.
They extended gratitude to the Express News team for amplifying their plight and urged higher authorities to ensure severe punishment for those responsible for Maryam's death while demanding justice.
