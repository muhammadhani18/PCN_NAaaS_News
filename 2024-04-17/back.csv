0,Cheema petitions for 'fair' open court trial,Former governor says obvious 'bad intentions' apparent through deliberate procedural mistakes in the order,"A Lahore High Court (LHC) division bench, led by Justice Aalia Neelum on Wednesday, requested responses from the Punjab government and other pertinent entities regarding a plea filed by former Punjab governor and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Umer Sarfraz Cheema, challenging his imprisonment trial stemming from a first information report (FIR) filed against him after the May 9 riots.
Cheema, in his petition, urged the court to annul the contested order that instigated his imprisonment trial and mandated the conduction of his trial in an open court to ensure 'equity and impartiality.'
The petitioner asserts that he is entitled to the fundamental rights as guaranteed in the Constitution of Pakistan.
The petitioner quoted several clauses of the Constitution particularly Articles 4, 9, 10, 10-A, 14, 19, and 25 - and stated that those articles promise liberty, security of person, safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention, right to fair trial, due process, inviolability of human dignity, freedom of speech, and equal protection of the law

Cheema contended that while the police filed a challan to a special judge in an anti-terrorism court (ATC) under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) in FIR 108/2023 against only five accused, including himself, the FIR implicates approximately 400 individuals in the reported incident.
The said report under Section 173 of CrPC mentions the apprehension of numerous accused individuals, who were subsequently detained for identification parades, subjected to physical remands, or involved in investigative procedures before being discharged or remanded to judicial custody on various occasions.
The petitioner argued that obvious 'bad intentions' are apparent from the procedural mistakes and illegal actions.
Two additional PTI leaders, one of whom was an accused, were implicated in this case at a later stage, despite their prior incarceration since May 2023. Supplementary challan reports under section 173 of CrPC were once again submitted before the adjudicating trial court concerning their involvement.
Following the framing of charges on November 21, 2023, the court ordered the trial of the accused to be conducted within the confines of the central jail, under an order issued on October 4, 2023.
The approval was granted for the trial concerning the aforementioned FIR filed with the Sarwar Road police in central jail Lahore.
The petitioner implores that an examination of the contents of the impugned order reveals an absence of reference to the competent authority or cabinet approval, either at the provincial or federal level.
The former governor alleged that the order was issued by a section officer on behalf of the additional chief secretary. He added that according to Sections 15(2) and 21(2)(b) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, only the government has the authority to issue such orders.
He implored that, therefore, the order is subject to being overturned.
The petitioner further asserted that the order was passed 'arbitrarily and unlawfully', without proper authority, as it fails to justify the issuing authority.
Cheema was arrested in connection with the arson, anarchy and chaos on May 9 followed by former PM Imran Khan’s arrest.
On February 6, the anti-terrorism court granted seven-day physical remand of PTI’s lawmakers including Cheema, Dr Yasmeen Rashid and others in a case registered against them over setting ablaze to PML-N’s office in response to May 9 riots.
Earlier this month, on April 8, a total of 20 suspects, who were tried by military courts in connection with the May 9 incidents were released following the confirmation of their sentences and subsequent remission of their punishments by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir.

2,Won’t go back without my sons: Indian woman,Farzana Begum says Pakistani man who married her lying about divorce,"Farzana Begum, an Indian woman who was allegedly tortured by her Pakistani husband, has said she did not wish to return to her native country.
She has also described her husband’s claim that he had divorced her as false.
“If he has divorced me, then there must be a certificate,” she added.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Farzana said that her and her children’s lives were in danger over a property dispute.
She added that she was confined to her house in Rehman Garden in Lahore and her children were enduring hunger.
She appealed to the Pakistani government to provide them with protection until their case was resolved.
Farzana said the house and some property in Lahore were in the name of her sons. However, she continued that her as well as her sons' passports were in possession of her husband.
The Indian woman stresses her lack of familial support in Pakistan, further complicating her predicament.
According to Farzana, her husband, along with his first wife and children, are plotting to coerce her return to India in order to seize control of her children's property upon their departure.
Farzana’s lawyer, Advocate Mohsin Abbas, told The Express Tribune that the husband was spreading false rumours that his client's visa had expired even though her passport was in his possession.
He continued that they had requested police to take back the passports of his client and her two sons from her husband to learn about the status of their visas.
The lawyer said if the Indian woman's visa had indeed expired, legal action would be taken to that extent only.
In one of her statements, Farzana said she would never return to India without her sons.
Farzana, who belongs to Mumbai, India, married a Pakistani citizen, Mirza Yousaf Elahi, in Abu Dhabi in 2015.
They came to Pakistan in 2018. They have two sons aged six and seven.
In February this year, a German resident Sikh woman of Indian origin married a man of Sialkot after embracing Islam in Pakistan.
The Muslim name of the girl is Zainab and she has married Ali Arsalan.
According to a certificate issued by the Jamia, the name of the father of Jaspreet Kaur is Singara Singh, a resident of Ludhiana.
The woman came to Pakistan on January 16 this year for pilgrimage.
The administrators of Jamia Hanfia in Sialkot said the bride’s parents were Indian nationals but they lived in Germany. Zainab also resided in Munich.

3,Imran decries ‘prevailing law of the jungle’,Claims foreign investment not possible in current situation,"Former prime minister Imran Khan has claimed that the law of the jungle prevails in the country, a circumstance he believes hampers foreign investment opportunities.
Speaking to reporters after a hearing of the £180m case in a court inside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Wednesday, Imran said the state of justice in the country could be gauged by the fact that while he was convicted in three different cases within five days, his political rivals Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari were acquitted in various cases expeditiously.
He also referred to a recent incident in Bahawalpur in which some policemen were allegedly beaten up by armed forces personnel and described the incident as another example of the law of the jungle.
Imran Khan, whose wife Bushra Bibi was also convicted and sentenced to prison in two different cases earlier this year, expressed serious concern about her state of health.
During the case hearing, the PTI founder also addressed the accountability court judge, Nasir Javed Rana, from the rostrum and voiced his concerns about her health.
He said Bushra Bibi’s health is deteriorating, but authorities have not allowed her to undergo an endoscopic test as prescribed by her doctors.
The former premier noted that his wife has not been ill during the six years of their marriage, and the sudden deterioration of her health is unusual.
“The matter of my wife's health is serious. The court should issue orders to conduct her tests. Nothing conclusive can be determined from a physical examination; the tests will reveal the facts,” he said. Imran warned that if anything happened to his wife, he would hold the army chief responsible for it.
The judge later directed authorities to allow Dr Asim Younus of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital to perform a check-up on Bushra Bibi at 12 noon today (Thursday).
The PTI has been accusing the powers that be of slow-poisoning Imran’s wife, who is currently detained at the PTI founder’s Bani Gala residence, declared a sub-jail on January 31 after her conviction in the gifts repository cases.

The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has announced to stage public rallies nationwide, with a particular focus on the province of Punjab, in the lead-up to the forthcoming by-elections slated for April 21.
Speaking to the press outside Adiala Jail alongside party leader Sher Afzal Marwat and other officials, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan confirmed that a scheduled meeting with the party's founder was in accordance with the directives of the high court, which had granted permission for the meeting.
Under the directives of Imran Khan, the chairman announced the party's plan to organise public rallies in Punjab and other regions before the by-elections. Imran Khan specifically tasked Sher Afzal Marwat with spearheading these rallies in Punjab, which are expected to be attended by senior party members.
Furthermore, it was noted that Imran Khan instructed the party's leadership to revamp the party’s activities nationwide, particularly in Punjab.

5,NAB clears Nawaz in Toshakhana reference,Anti-graft body tells court ex-PM did not use alleged fake account to pay for vehicle," 
The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Wednesday gave a clean chit to PML-N supremo and former premier Nawaz Sharif in a reference related to the acquisition of a luxury vehicle from the Toshakhana (gift repository).
The anti-graft body submitted a report to an accountability court affirming its authority to acquit the former premier in the Toshakhana case.
The report read that the Supreme Court had passed instructions to investigate an alleged fake account associated with Nawaz.
However, it continued that the PML-N supremo did not utilise funds from the alleged account to pay for the vehicle acquired from the Toshakhana.
The report by the country’s graft-buster further read that the vehicle gifted to then-premier Nawaz by Saudi Arabia was relinquished to Toshakhana in 1997. It clarified that in 2008 when it was bought by Nawaz, it was no longer under the ownership of the Toshakhana but that of the federal transport pool.
“This case may attract any other offence but it has no relevancy with the benefit of Toshakhana as the subject vehicle when purchased was not part of Toshakhana, rather than the same was part of the federal transport pool,” it read.
Read Nawaz gets relief from courts after ‘surrendering’ to law
The anti-graft body urged the court to acquit or discharge Nawaz from the reference.
In a reference filed in March 2020, the accountability watchdog alleged that during the term of then-PM Yousaf Raza Gilani, rules were violated to allow former president Asif Ali Zardari and ex-premier Nawaz to acquire luxury vehicles from the state’s gift repository.
It alleged that Gilani facilitated Zardari and Nawaz, claiming that he dishonestly relaxed the government's gift acceptance procedure in 2007.
The procedure stipulated that vehicles presented as gifts by foreign dignitaries shall not be allowed to be purchased by the recipients and be given to the central pool under the care of the Cabinet Division.
In June 2020, an accountability court issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Nawaz, who had skipped hearings as he had begun his self-imposed exile in London.
In September 2020, the accountability court declared the PML-N supremo an absconder due to his continuous non-appearance in the Toshakhana case and ordered the confiscation of his property.
According to the anti-corruption body, Zardari and Nawaz retained the vehicles “against a nominal payment of 15% of their total value” through “dishonest and illegal means for their personal benefit and interest”.
Before his return to Pakistan in October last year, an accountability court suspended the perpetual arrest warrants issued in 2020 for Nawaz in the case. He was granted bail days later.
In November last year, NAB informed an accountability court in Lahore that it had recorded Nawaz’s statement in the reference.
