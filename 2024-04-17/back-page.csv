0,29 Maoists killed in shootout with Indian forces,Security beefed up in conflict-stricken Chhattisgarh ahead of general election,"JAGDALPUR: At least 29 Maoist insurgents were killed in a shootout with security forces on Tuesday, police said, one of the deadliest days in the long-running conflict. 
The guerrillas were killed in a remote part of the central state of Chhattisgarh, which has seen a number of deadly assaults on Maoist forces this year. 
The insurgents, who are known as Naxalites and say they are fighting for the rural poor, have carried out guerilla attacks since 1967. 
Security has been stepped up in Chhattisgarh ahead of a marathon six-week general election beginning on Friday. 
All 29 died in Kanker district, south of the state capital Raipur. District police chief I.K. Elesela confirmed Tuesday’s toll to AFP, saying the rebels had been pursued in a joint operation between police and the paramilitary Border Security Force (BSF).

“One BSF soldier and a Kanker police officer have sustained bullet injuries,” he said. A large quantity of weapons, including four automatic firearms, had been recovered from the dead, he said. 
Elesela earlier told local media that Shankar Rao, a top rebel commander who was the subject of a $300,000 reward for information leading to his capture, was among those killed. 
A BSF statement said the operation had been running since Monday evening to intercept the Maoists after learning of their movements near the village of Binagunda. 
Bastar district police inspector-general Sundarraj Pattilingam said three members of the government security forces had been wounded in the skirmish.
“But they are walking,” he said.
‘Red Corridor’ 
Tuesday’s clash was the second of its kind this month, after the killing of 13 Maoist rebels during a shootout in Chhattisgarh on April 2. 
Around 80 Maoists have been killed in India this year, according to police figures, the vast majority in that state. 
India has deployed tens of thousands of security personnel to battle Maoist rebels across the insurgent-dominated “Red Corridor”, which stretches across central, southern and eastern states but has shrunk in size. 
The conflict has seen a number of deadly attacks on government forces over the years. 
India has pumped millions of dollars into infrastructure development in remote areas and claims to have confined the insurgency to 45 districts in 2023, down from 96 in 2010. 
Twenty-two police and paramilitaries were killed in a gun battle with the far-left guerrillas in 2021. 
In March 2020, 17 police from a commando patrol were killed in an attack by more than 300 armed rebels in Chhattisgarh. 
Sixteen commandos were also killed in the western state of Maharashtra in a bomb attack that was blamed on the Maoists in the lead-up to India’s election in 2019.

1,"US, China discuss defence ties, global issues",US looking to counter China's growing influence but also maintain communication with Beijing to prevent tensions spiraling out of control.,"WASHINGTON: US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun via video teleconference on Tuesday, the Pentagon said, in the first substantive talks between the superpowers’ defence chiefs in nearly 18 months. 
The United States has been working to strengthen defence cooperation with its allies in the Asia-Pacific region to counter China’s growing influence, but also wants to maintain lines of communication with Beijing to prevent tensions from spiraling out of control. 
“The two officials discussed US-PRC defence relations and regional and global security issues,” the Pentagon said in a statement, referring to the People’s Republic of China. 
“Secretary Austin emphasised the importance of continuing to open lines of military-to-military communication between the United States and the PRC” following talks between the two sides in recent months, the statement said. 
Austin also “reiterated that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate — safely and responsibly — wherever international law allows,” and “underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea”. 
Austin’s last significant interaction with a Chinese counterpart occurred in November 2022 in Cambodia.

2,Inferno devastates historic Copenhagen bourse building,"Danish museum sends employees to save artefacts, paintings.","COPENHAGEN: A fire ripped through Copenhagen’s Old Stock Exchange, one of the Danish capital’s most famous landmarks, on Tuesday, engulfing its spire which collapsed in a scene reminiscent of the 2019 blaze at Paris’ Notre-Dame Cathedral.
Emergency services, employees from the Danish Chamber of Commerce, including its CEO Brian Mikkelsen, and even passers-by were seen carrying large paintings away from the building in a race to save historic artefacts from the flames.
A video showed the flaming spire breaking in half as it tumbled down, sending a large part crashing to the ground next to a fire truck.
“Everybody is crying at the Danish Chamber of Commerce right now. It’s their workplace, but also their history,” Mikkelsen told reporters, shaking his head in disbelief.

Danish museum sends employees to save artefacts, paintings

“It’s our cultural heritage that I’m looking at. It’s 400 years that have shaped Danish cultural history and the society we live in today.”
Denmark’s National Museum sent 25 employees to the scene to help evacuate cultural artefacts and paintings, it said on X.
 






The historic building, whose spire was shaped as the tails of four dragons intertwined, had been under renovationand clad in scaffolding when the fire broke out.
However, Danish rescue services said in the afternoon that the fire was “under control”.  There were no reports of injuries, police said, and it was not immediately clear what caused the blaze.
The Dutch Renaissance-style building no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, but serves as headquarters for the Chamber of Commerce.

3,Largest black hole discovered in Milky Way,"The black hole, named Gaia BH3, was discovered “by chance” from data collected by the European Space Agency.","PARIS: Astronomers identified the largest stellar black hole yet discovered in the Milky Way, with a mass 33 times that of the Sun, according to a study published on Tuesday. 
The black hole, named Gaia BH3, was discovered “by chance” from data collected by the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission, said an astronomer from the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) at the Observatoire de Paris, Pasquale Panuzzo. 
Gaia, which is dedicated to mapping the Milky Way galaxy, located BH3 2,000 light years away from Earth in the Aquila constellation. 
As Gaia’s telescope can give a precise position of stars in the sky, astronomers were able to characterise their orbits and measure the mass of the star’s invisible companion — 33 times that of the Sun. 
Further observations from on-the-ground telescopes confirmed that it was a black hole with a mass far greater than the stellar black holes already in the Milky Way. 
“No one was expecting to find a high-mass black hole lurking nearby, undetected so far. This is the kind of discovery you make once in your research life,” Panuzzo said in a press release. 
The stellar black hole was discovered when scientists spotted a “wobbling” motion on the companion star that was orbiting it. 
Stellar black holes are created from the collapse of massive stars at the end of their lives and are smaller than supermassive black holes whose creation is still unknown. 
Such giants have already been detected in distant galaxies via gravitational waves. But “never in ours”, said Panuzzo. 
BH3 is a “dormant” black hole and is too far away from its companion star to strip it of its matter and therefore emits no X-rays — making it difficult to detect. 
Gaia’s telescope identified the first two inactive black holes (Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2) in the Milky Way. 
Gaia has been operating 1.5 million kilometres from Earth for the past 10 years and in 2022 delivered a 3D map of the positions and motions of more than 1.8 billion stars.
