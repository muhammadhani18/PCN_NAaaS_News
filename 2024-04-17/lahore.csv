Speaking at a press conference here on Tuesday, he warned that his party would consider taking to the streets if the government failed to meet the farmers’ demand for a better wheat price.
Flanked by Ibrar Shah, Usman Malik, Ahsan Rizvi and others, he recalled that the PPP’s federal government back in 2008-2013 had increased the support price of wheat resulting in surplus grain production in the country.  
Criticising successive governments for neglecting the welfare of farmers, he pointed out that the then Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government announced a Rs1,200 billion package for the industry during the Covid-19 pandemic but not a single penny was allocated for the farming community.  
Expecting a good wheat crop this season, Mr Chan insisted that the government must purchase every surplus grain to be offered by the farmers.

The cheques of Rs100,000 each were handed over to the families of the victims by Mandi Deputy Commissioner Shahid Marth.
The compensation was given by the Mandi district from its own resources and heirs of three other victims of the firing belonging to Gujranwala and Wazirabad are yet to receive any such amount from their district administrations.
Talking to Dawn by telephone, Gujranwala Commissioner Naveed Haider Sheerazi said he had sent directions to the Gujranwala DC to issue cheques of financial assistance to the bereaved families and hopefully the DC would do the needful in a couple of days.
He added that the Balochistan government had also decided to pay some financial assistance to the heirs of the deceased youths as the Noshki deputy Commissioner had approached the DCs of Mandi Bahauddin, Gujranwala and Wazirabad, seeking details of the families. But the exact amount of financial assistance from the Balochistan government was yet to be known, Mr Sheerazi said.

Mandi dist admin pays from own resources; Gujranwala, Wazirabad victims’ heirs  yet to receive amount

Earlier, Qul for all the six deceased was held at their native village Chak Fateh Shah in Mandi Bahauddin on Tuesday. The Mandi Bahauddin DC along with the other officials attended prayers for the departed souls.
At least nine young men, from the age of 17 to 23 years, belonging to districts of Mandi, Gujranwala and Wazirabad, were killed by the firing of armed men. They were going to Taftan on the Iran-Pakistan border from Quetta. The attackers, who had set up a cordon on the N-40 Quetta-Noshki Highway, intercepted the bus they were travelling in and looted the belongings of passengers, including cash and mobile phones.
After checking the national identity cards of the passengers, the gunmen separated the nine passengers belonging to Punjab and took them away. Their bullet-riddled bodies were later dumped under a bridge in a hilly area of Noshki. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) had claimed responsibility for the killings.
The deceased youths had valid visas of Iran and Iraq; however, the sources in their close families said that these youth had left the houses with intention to go Europe by illegally crossing the borders into Turkey and then Europe.
The deceased hailed from the poor families and they had paid a sum of Rs260,000 each to a Gujranwala-based agent as an initial amount as rest of the amount had to be paid by them after their reaching the destination.

PbBC Vice Chairman Kamran Bashir Mughal said amendments have been made to the rules and regulations of the council regarding the lawyers who cause disgrace to the profession through their social media activities.
Citing the amendments, he said that the case of any lawyer found involved in such disgraceful actions would be referred to the disciplinary committee.
He said as the PbBC, a regulatory body, could itself impose penalties on the lawyers, the police would not be allowed to register cases against them under the anti-terrorism law.  
Mughal explained that the amendment for the prosecution specifies that any lawyer who posts or makes videos with film songs, bodyguards, or engages in any other activity that tarnishes the image of the black coat, would be held responsible for misconduct and such cases would be referred to the disciplinary committee for a decision.
He emphasised that the PbBC is a regulatory authority and strictly adheres to its established rules and regulations.
He alleged that the police had failed to maintain law and order and were trying to shift the blame onto lawyers through “negative tactics”.
The vice chairman condemned the registration of recent cases against lawyers on terrorism charges and demanded immediate steps to withdraw the same.
Mr Mughal urged the Lahore High Court chief justice to play phis role in bridging the divide between the bench and the bar.
He said the bar always stood behind the bench to uphold the dignity and freedom of the judiciary, and that the bench should also engage the bar to strengthen the judiciary.
