DUBAI: Dubai’s major international airport began diverting all incoming flights on Tuesday as heavy rains lashed the city, causing widespread flooding.
The world’s busiest air hub for international passengers, which had been expecting more than 100 flights on Tuesday evening, earlier briefly halted its operations in the chaos caused by the storm.
Dubai has been paralysed by the torrential rain that caused floods around the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and left 18 dead in Oman on Sunday and Monday. “Due to the continued exceptional weather event currently being experienced in the UAE, Dubai International is temporarily diverting inbound flights due to arrive this evening,” a Dubai Airports spokesperson said, adding that departures will continue.
Images on social media showed planes taxiing across an apron flooded with standing water. Similar scenes were repeated across Dubai and elsewhere in the UAE as the desert country, better known for its arid climate and intense summer heat, reeled from the storm.

Flagship shopping centres Dubai Mall and Mall of the Emirates both suffered flooding and water was ankle-deep in at least one Dubai Metro station, according to images posted on social media. Roads and residential communities also suffered heavy flooding and many residents reported leaks from roofs, doors and windows.
Schools were shut across the UAE and were expected to remain closed on Wednesday, when further storms are forecast. Dubai’s government also extended remote working for its employees into Wednesday.
Some inland areas of the UAE recorded more than 80 millimetres (3.2 inches) of rain over 24 hours to 8am, approaching the annual average of about 100mm.
The weather board “urged residents to take all the precautions… and to stay away from areas of flooding and water accumulation” in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
Bahrain was also hit by heavy rain and flooding after being pummelled by thunder and lightning overnight.
150 Pakistanis stranded at Al Ain Airport
Meanwhile, some 150 passengers were stranded for hours at the UAE’s Al Ain Airport on Tuesday. Their flight, Flydubai FZ-334, en route from Karachi to Dubai, was diverted due to heavy rainfall that flooded the Dubai airport, making it impossible for the aircraft to land.
A video shared by a passenger showed the extent of flooding at Dubai Airport, highlighting the severe weather conditions that led to the diversion. According to Flightradar, a real-time flight tracking service, the flight, which was supposed to land in Dubai at 12:45pm, was rerouted to Al Ain, landing there around 4pm.
Upon arrival, the situation worsened for the passengers, as they reported a lack of basic amenities at Al Ain Airport, which is smaller and less equipped than Dubai’s international hub. Passengers voiced their frustration over the absence of food, stating that neither lunch nor dinner was provided.
They said there were no accommodations available and the airport lacked sufficient dining facilities. The airline and airport authorities couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.

1,Grilling of potential jurors in Trump trial begins,Frustrated former president vents his rage on day two of historic trial.,"NEW YORK: Prosecutors began grilling prospective jurors in Donald Trump’s historic criminal trial on Tuesday, kicking off a grueling process in which both sides will look to weed out biased panelists.
No other US ex-president has faced a criminal trial and the pressure is high on defence attorneys and prosecutors to get a dozen jurors able to sit in judgement on a man running to return to the White House this November.
After a preliminary phase in which prospective jurors could opt out if they felt unable to be impartial, the prosecution began detailed questioning of an initial panel of 12, with Trump’s defence team to follow.
The high bar in a criminal trial means that to convict Trump of his alleged fraud in a scheme to cover up an embarrassing alleged extramarital encounter with a porn star will require a unanimous jury. Even one dissenting voice would see him walk free.

Frustrated former president vents his rage on day two of historic trial

The painstaking process was expected to take as long as two weeks before arguments can even begin, eating deep into the presidential campaign.
Trump, 77, has been ordered by Judge Juan Merchan to attend daily and on arrival on Tuesday for the second day the Republican was fuming.
“I should be right now in Penn­sylvania and Florida — in many other states, North Carolina, Georgia — campaigning,” Trump said, calling Merchan, “Trump-hating.”
Trump ‘undeterrable’
Merchan has warned Trump against repeating his frequent past attempts to turn hearings into impromptu campaign appearances with outbursts at witnesses and staff, as well tirades on social media.
The judge has already scheduled a hearing next week to consider whether Trump should be held in contempt for violating a partial gag order restricting him from attacking individuals connected to the case.
“Trump is probably largely undeterrable because he believes he is advancing his political agenda and will gain votes,” Columbia Law School professor John Coffee said.
Illustrating the extraordinary tension, potential jurors have been told they will remain anonymous to the public throughout. Merchan said this is to protect them from possible bribery or physical harm. But selecting 12 ordinary citizens to judge one of the most famous — and controversial — figures in the country is no easy matter.
Of the first batch of 96 prospective panelists sworn in for screening on Monday, at least 50 were quickly excused after they said they could not be fair and impartial.
Nine others were allowed to leave after stating there were compelling reasons they could not serve, while remaining prospective jurors were grilled about their education, hobbies and news consumption.
Political peril
Trump faces three other criminal cases centered on his hoarding of top-secret documents after leaving office and his unprecedented attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden.

Rescuers in rubber boats joined by marine commandos and divers were searching for three others believed to have been aboard.
Residents said the remaining missing were schoolchildren on their way to class when the boat overturned in the Jhelum river in the city of Srinagar.
“Six died in the accident, another six were rescued and three are still missing,” Srinagar district magistrate Bilal Mohi-ud-Din Bhat said. “Our information so far is that 15 people were on the boat,” he said.
Three of those rescued were being treated at a hos­pital and the other three were sent home, Bhat said.
Residents had initially reported to local disaster management field personnel that 26 people were on the boat. “It turned out that probably not all of them had boarded,” a top official said.
Grief-stricken relatives gathered at the banks of the river as news of the accident spread. Huge crowds joined funeral prayers in Srinagar to mourn the deaths, among them a woman and her two sons along with three other children.
All of the children aboard were aged between 10 and 16, residents said. The river was swollen after days of rain across the valley.
The small vessel had no motor but its crew propelled it between the riverbanks by pulling a rope fixed at both ends. Witnesses said the rope snapped with the force of the fast-flowing water, sending the boat crashing against a pillar of a partially built footbridge nearby.

Keynote speakers at the “national conservatism” conference included the eurosceptic populist Nigel Farage and Britain’s former interior minister Suella Braverman, with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban scheduled to address the two-day gathering on Wednesday.
Farage’s speech went ahead amid swirling rumours the event was about to be shut down, followed by Braverman, who took the stage despite police entering the venue to notify organisers of a ban.
France’s far-right former presidential candidate Eric Zemmour was later barred by police from entering the venue to deliver an address on migration. “I think it’s absolutely monstrous,” Farage told reporters after wrapping up his address.
“This is the complete old Communist style where if you don’t agree with me, you’ve got to be banned, you’ve got to be shut down,” said the Brexit figurehead.

4,Scholz urges China to use Russia ‘influence’ to end Ukraine war,Says Xi had agreed to back a peace conference in Switzerland.,"BEIJING: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday he had urged Xi Jinping to press ally Russia to end its “senseless” war in Ukraine and that the Chinese president had agreed to back a peace conference in Switzerland.
Scholz said after a meeting with Xi at Beijing’s Diaoyutai State Guesthouse on Tuesday that “China’s word carries weight in Russia”. “I have therefore asked President Xi to influence Russia so that Putin finally calls off his senseless campaign, withdraw his troops and ends this terrible war,” he said on social media platform X.
He said Xi had agreed to back a peace conference in Switzerland, which is due to take place in June without Russia in attendance.
Welcoming Xi’s backing, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy responded on X that China could help deliver a “just peace” for his country by playing an “active role” in the international conference. China says it is a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict but it has been criticised for refusing to condemn Moscow’s offensive.
China and Russia have ramped up economic cooperation and diplomatic contacts in recent years, with their strategic partnership only growing closer since the invasion of Ukraine.
Scholz said in talks with Xi on Tuesday “the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine and Russia’s arms build-up have a very significant negative impact on security in Europe”, according to a recording provided by the chancellor’s office.
“They directly affect our core interests,” he told Xi, adding they “damage the entire international order because they violate a principle of the United Nations Charter”.
Scholz, whose country is Ukraine’s second-biggest military backer after the United States, stressed at a news conference later that it was important to “advance the diplomatic efforts that Ukraine is also working very hard on”.
“I believe that this progress is necessary because, in addition to the military support for Ukraine from Germany and its allies, there is also a need for a dialogue between the two countries,” he said.
‘Increasing risks’
Chinese state media, in turn, said Xi had highlighted the importance of ties in the face of “increasing risks and challenges”. State broadcaster CCTV said Xi laid out what state media described as “four principles to prevent the Ukraine crisis from spiralling out of control and to restore peace”.
Nations must focus on “the uphol­ding of peace and stability and refrain from seeking selfish gains”, Xi said, as well as “cool down the situation and not add fuel to the fire”.
“We need to create conditions for the restoration of peace and refrain from further exacerbating tensions,” Xi said, while aiming to “reduce the negative impact on the world economy”.
The “four principles” echoed a Beijing paper last year that called for a “political settlement” to the conflict, which Western countries said could enable Russia to hold much of the territory it has seized in Ukraine.
CCTV also released footage, set to an uplifting classical tune, of the two leaders going for a walk in the picturesque garden of the statehouse for “in-depth exchanges”.
The chancellor of the world’s third largest economy landed in China, the second largest, on Sunday, accompanied by an extensive delegation of ministers and business executives, for his second visit since taking office.

5,Two arrested for firing at Salman Khan’s home,Khan has been in the crosshairs of the Bishnoi gang since 1998 for shooting two blackbucks on a recreational hunting trip.,"

AHMEDABAD: Two members of a notorious criminal gang were arrested by Indian police on Tuesday for firing at the home of Bollywood actor Salman Khan in retaliation for the superstar’s killing of two antelopes.
The Bishnoi gang, accused of several murders and extortion rackets, hails from a wider desert-based religious sect that considers the species to be the reincarnation of their guru.
Khan, 58, has been in the crosshairs of the group since 1998 for shooting two blackbucks on a recreational hunting trip. The gang’s jailed leader Lawrence Bishnoi has threatened Khan with assassination in the past.
Two men on a motorbike shot at Khan’s first-floor apartment during the early hours of Sunday in the upscale Mumbai neighbourhood of Bandra, also firing several rounds in the air before fleeing.
Khan, who is always guarded by armed policemen owing to threats to his life, was home when the gunshots were fired. The two men aged 24 and 21 were arrested in the western state of Gujarat, police said.
“We were able to locate the two accused near a temple,” Kutch district police officer Mahendra Bagaria said. “One of our teams reached the temple and nabbed the accused.” Members of the Bishnoi community pursued a criminal case against Khan for the blackbuck shooting for 20 years. Khan was sentenced to five years in jail by a local court for violating the Wildlife Protection Act in 2018.
But the penalty was suspended on appeal just days after Khan was sent to prison, prompting Lawrence Bishnoi to warn soon afterwards that his gang would take the law into their own hands.
The gang leader has been accused of orchestrating several murders including the killing of popular Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala in 2022.
Khan has starred in nearly 150 films and television shows since his first hit in the 1980s, and remains one of Bollywood’s most bankable figures.

6,Israel kills Hezbollah commander in Lebanon,"BEIRUT: An Israeli strike killed a local Hezbollah commander in south Lebanon on Tuesday, the Israeli army and a...","BEIRUT: An Israeli strike killed a local Hezbollah commander in south Lebanon on Tuesday, the Israeli army and a source close to the movement said.Tuesday’s strike came with regional tensions high after Iran launched missile and drone attacks on Israel over the weekend in retaliation for a deadly Israeli strike on Tehran’s consulate in Damascus.
The Israeli military said its “aircraft struck and eliminated Ismail Yusef Baz, the commander of Hezbollah’s coastal sector”, adding he was killed in the Ain Baal area.
The official National News Agency reported one dead in an Israeli strike on a car in Ain Baal, about 15 kilometres (nine miles) from the border, later saying “enemy warplanes” struck two cars in Shehabiya, about 10 kilometres from Ain Baal, reporting casualties.
Hezbollah announced in a statement that Baz had been killed, without mentioning his rank or role. But a source close to the group said that “the field commander in charge of the Naqura region” had been killed “in an Israeli strike”.
Hezbollah said it launched Katyusha rockets on a base in northern Israel’s Beit Hillel “in response to the Israeli enemy’s attacks” on Lebanese villages, “the latest of which was in Ain Baal”.
Hezbollah claimed an attack on Beit Hillel using explosive drones, with local Israeli authorities saying three people were wounded. The Israeli military said “two armed” drones entered from Lebanon and exploded near Beit Hillel.
Hezbollah had said its fighters launched an “air attack with suicide drones in two phases... striking the Iron Dome (air defence system) platforms and their crew” in the area.

7,"Israeli tanks push back into northern Gaza, warplanes hit Rafah",Families which had returned home begin moving out again after the raid.,"

CAIRO: Israeli tanks pushed back into parts of the northern Gaza Strip on Tuesday which they had left weeks ago, while warplanes conducted air strikes on Rafah, the Palestinians’ last refuge in the south of the territory, killing and wounding several people, medics and residents said.
Residents reported an internet outage in the areas of Beit Hanoun and Jabalia in northern Gaza. Tanks advanced into Beit Hanoun and surrounded some schools where displaced families have taken refuge, said the residents and media outlets of Hamas.
“Occupation soldiers ordered all families inside the schools and the nearby houses where the tanks had advanced to evacuate. The soldiers detained many men,” one resident of northern Gaza said.
Beit Hanoun, home to 60,000 people, was one of the first areas targeted by Israel’s ground offensive in Gaza last October. Heavy bombardment turned most of Beit Hanoun, once known as ‘the basket of fruit’ because of its orchards, into a ghost town comprising piles of rubble.

Families which had returned home begin moving out again after the raid

Many families who had returned to Beit Hanoun and Jabalia in recent weeks after Israeli forces withdrew, began moving out again on Tuesday because of the new raid, some residents said.
Palestinian health officials said an Israeli strike had killed four people and wounded several others in Rafah, where over half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are sheltering and bracing for a planned Israeli ground offensive into the city, which borders Egypt.
Later on Tuesday, Palestinian health officials and Hamas media said an Israeli air strike had killed 11 Palestinians, including children, in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip.
“My brothers were sitting by the door, my brother was injured, and his cousin too, and I lost my son, I do not have a house, nor a husband, nor anything anymore,” said Wafaa Issa al-Nouri, whose son Mohammad and husband were killed in the strike.
“He was playing by the door, we didn’t do anything, I swear we didn’t do anything,” she said.
The Hamas-run interior ministry also said an Israeli air strike had hit a police car in the Tuffah district of Gaza City, killing four police officers and three civilian passers-by.
No sign of ceasefire
After six months of fighting, there is still no sign of any breakthrough in US-backed talks led by Qatar and Egypt to clinch a ceasefire deal in Gaza, as Israel and Hamas stick to their mutually irreconcilable conditions.In Al-Nussei­rat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, residents said Israeli planes had bombed and destroyed four multi-storey residential buildings on Tuesday.
Israel is still imposing “unlawful” restrictions on humanitarian relief for Gaza, the UN human rights office said on Tuesday, despite assertions from Israel and others that barriers have eased.
The amount of aid now entering Gaza is disputed, with Israel and Washington saying aid flows have risen in recent days but UN agencies say it is still far below bare minimum levels.
Israel is under international pressure to allow more aid into Gaza, especially northern areas where famine is expected by May, according to the United Nations.

8,UN calls on Tel Aviv to end support of settler attacks,"“Israel, as the occupying power, must take all measures in its power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order"", says UN high commissioner.","GENEVA: The United Nations human rights office on Tuesday called on Israel to halt its support of attacks by settlers in the occupied West Bank, which has seen an uptick of raids since Oct 7.
The call came a day after Israeli settlers shot dead two Palestinians in the West Bank on Monday, after Israeli forces killed a Palestinian teenager during a military raid.
“Israel, as the occupying power, must take all measures in its power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety in the occupied West Bank,” said Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
“This obligation includes protecting Palestinians from settler attacks, and ending unlawful use of force against Palestinians by the Israeli Security Forces.” She added: “The Israeli Security Forces must immediately end their active participation in and support for settler attacks on Palestinians.”
Violence in the West Bank was already on the rise before Israel’s assault on Gaza. It has escalated since, with stepped-up Israeli military raids and settler violence.
Shamdasani described the escalating violence in the West Bank as “a matter of grave concern.”
