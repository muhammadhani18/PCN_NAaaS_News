0,IMF sees further uptick in Pakistan’s inflation,"Inflation expected at 24.8% for fiscal year, approximately 1% above previous forecast","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has kept Pakistan’s economic growth forecast unchanged at 2% but increased the inflation projection to nearly 25% for this fiscal year. This adjustment comes as the country undergoes another round of increases in utility and fuel prices.
In its World Economic Outlook report released on the sidelines of the spring meetings, the global lender also revised the current account deficit downward to 1.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) or below $4 billion.
The projection is still about $1.5 billion higher than Pakistan’s estimates.
The IMF has also upward revised the inflation forecast for the next fiscal year 2024-25 but did not change the economic growth projection.
The IMF report showed that during the current fiscal year, Pakistan’s economy may grow at a rate of 2%, a forecast that is consistent with the IMF’s first review report under the $3 billion standby arrangement. The forecast is also in line with the projections made by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank that showed estimates little below 2%.
During the second quarter of this fiscal year, Pakistan’s economy grew by just 1% due to continued restrictions on imports, tight monetary policy and increasing cost of doing business that is taking goods out of the reach of the majority of the people.
The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics reported on Tuesday that the large-scale manufacturing sector contracted 0.51% during the July- February period of this fiscal year when compared with the same period of last year.
This suggests that the economic growth rate in the third quarter may also remain subdued, barring better output in the agriculture sector.
The IMF report indicates that inflation for this fiscal year may persist at 24.8%, approximately 1% higher than its forecast from four months ago. This adjustment comes as the PBS reported a slowdown in the inflation rate to 20.7% in March.
The central bank did not reduce the interest rate in its last meeting despite there being significant room for reduction.
The federal government on Monday increased the petrol price by Rs4.53 per litre, which was far higher than the Rs1.73 per litre increase in the average Platts prices. There is a need to investigate the Ministry of Finance for fleecing consumers who are now forced to pay the Rs294 per litre price.
The ministry also passed on a Rs1.34 per litre exchange rate adjustment despite the rupee remaining stable during the past two weeks. The Ministry of Finance also unnecessarily increased the inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) from Rs5.30 per litre to Rs6.75 per litre –putting an additional Rs1.45 per litre burden on the consumers. The IFEM is Rs3.71 per litre for high-speed diesel.
In a press statement, the Ministry of Finance claimed that during the last 15 days, the price of gasoline in the world market increased by $3.82 per barrel. Similarly, the price of high-speed diesel increased by $4.30 per barrel, the ministry spokesperson said.
The spokesman stated that OGRA has proposed to increase the price of petrol by Rs4.53 per litre and the price of high-speed diesel by Rs8.14.
Another round of increases in the prices of gas and electricity is also around the corner, which would further stoke inflation. The prime minister also on Monday gave a go-ahead to implement the gas prices, based on the average of the local and imported gas. This would increase the prices by about 41%.
The IMF report further stated that during the next fiscal year, Pakistan’s economy may grow by 3.5%. It added that inflation could stay around 12.7%, which is 1% higher than its previous forecast.
The IMF released the report a day before Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is scheduled to meet with the Managing Director of the IMF to secure another bailout package.
In an interview with the AFP in Washington, the finance minister said that Pakistan has initiated discussions with the IMF over a new multi-billion-dollar loan agreement to support its economic reform programme. The news agency cited Aurangzeb as saying that Pakistan initiated the discussion with the Fund to get into a larger and extended programme.
An IMF spokesperson told AFP that the Fund is “currently focused on the completion of the current Stand-by Agreement programme”.
A finance ministry official said that the IMF Executive board meeting date to approve the last loan tranche of $1.1 billion would be decided in a couple of days by the global lender. He said that the meeting will be held before the end of April.
The World Economic Outlook report stated that global growth is estimated at 3.2% in 2023 and is projected to continue at the same pace in 2024 and 2025. The projection for 2024 is revised up by 0.1 percentage point from the January 2024 report and by 0.3 percentage point with respect to the October 2023 WEO forecast.
The IMF has cut Pakistan’s current account deficit projection from 1.5% of the GDP to 1.1% for this fiscal year. This brings down the deficit to below $4 billion but it is still far higher than the Ministry of Finance’s estimates of a $2.5 billion deficit.
For the next fiscal year, the IMF has projected the current account deficit at 1.2% of the GDP, according to the report. The next fiscal year’s current account deficit projections are critical in assessing the country’s total external financing needs, including the requirements for loan repayments.

1,‘Misuse’ prompted ban on X,Govt report informs IHC security concerns necessitated decision,"The interior ministry on Wednesday informed the Islamabad High Court that the ban on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, was necessary following its failure to address concerns regarding its “misuse”.
Interior Secretary Khurram Agha, on behalf of the ministry, submitted a report to the court in response to a petition challenging the ban on the social media platform.
The report also requested the court to dismiss the petition stating that “no right of the petitioner has been deprived”.
“[The] failure of Twitter/X to adhere to the lawful directives of the government of Pakistan and address concerns regarding the misuse of its platform necessitated the imposition of a ban,” it read.
It added that the petition against the closure of X was contrary to law and facts.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Cybercrime Wing had requested X to ban accounts that were propagating against the chief justice, the report stated.
It noted that X officials ignored the requests of the FIA Cybercrime Wing and did not respond, following which the decision to temporarily block the platform was made.
The report read that on the intelligence agencies’ request, the interior ministry issued orders for the closure of X on February 17, 2024, aimed at safeguarding the national security as well as the law and order situation.
“The decision to impose a ban on Twitter/X in Pakistan was made in the interest of upholding national security, maintaining public order, and preserving the integrity of our nation,"" it continued.
“Social media platforms are being used indiscriminately to spread extremist ideas and false information. X is being used as a tool by some nefarious elements to undermine law and order and promote instability.”
The ministry stated in the report that the closure of X was not against Article 19 of the Constitution and it was blocked in response to the rising security concerns that led to a ban on many social media platforms, even around the world.
The report added that X's closure was not intended to curtail freedom of expression or access to information, but aimed at the responsible use of social media platforms in accordance with the law.
“The Ministry of Interior is the protector of the citizens of Pakistan and responsible for national stability.”
The ministry's report highlighted that social media platform TikTok was also banned by the government earlier and it was unblocked only after it signed an agreement to abide by the Pakistani law.
Access to the social media giant has been blocked since February 17 this year after allegations of rigging during the general elections surfaced.

The prolonged disruption of X raised widespread concerns about democratic freedoms in the country.
A total of 28 civil society organisations, including Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, issued a joint statement of condemnation.
At the last hearing, the IHC dismissed a report on the closure of X and summoned the interior secretary to provide documentary evidence to justify the ban of the platform.
On Wednesday, Advocate Amna Ali and Additional Attorney General (AAG) Munawar Iqbal Duggal appeared before the court on the behalf of the petitioner and the State respectively.
The AAG informed the IHC that the interior ministry had filed a report on the matter.
The IHC CJ observed that another petition had been filed on the blockade.
He added that he was issuing notices to the respondents on the fresh petition plea and sought a reply on it.
Later, the hearing was adjourned till May 2.
In a related development, the Sindh High Court ordered the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to submit a fresh response with appropriate reasons to the petitions related to the closure of X.
A two-member bench led by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi heard the petitions. During the hearing, Advocate Abdul Moiz Jaferii, the counsel for the petitioners told the court that the PTA had submitted a reply in which it had admitted that access to X had been locked since March 18.
Jaferii added that the PTA in its reply had stated that the access to X was blocked on the instructions of the interior ministry, but the regulator did not give any reasons for the move.
Appearing before the court, the AAG stated that his X account was running fine and that he had accessed and used the platform a day earlier.
The SHC CJ asked the AAG to file an affidavit that his X account and the internet were working perfectly.
Justice Abbasi remarked that the interior ministry and other institutions should respond to the petitions so that the decision could be made regarding X. He expressed his annoyance that the court orders had not been implemented.
The SHC CJ directed the AAG to review the reply submitted to the court earlier and resubmit it within a week.
The court ordered the PTA to give valid reasons for shutting down X and adjourned the hearing till May 9. It also ordered the interior ministry to rescind within a week its February 17 letter instructing the PTA to block X.

2,Ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameed faces army inquiry,Panel to probe former spy master for misuse of authority,"The army on Wednesday constituted a high-level inquiry committee headed by a major general to look into the allegations against Lt-Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed that he as Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) director general misused his authority.
The inquiry has been ordered in pursuant to the orders of the Supreme Court and in the light of the directives of the Ministry of Defence, according to the people familiar with the development.
This is the first formal inquiry ordered against Gen Faiz, who resigned in November 2022, four months before his retirement date.
Faiz served as DG C in the ISI and later headed the spy agency. His name surfaced in many controversies, including the Faizabad Dharna case. Three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif named him and Gen Bajwa as the main characters behind his removal through a Supreme Court order.
While Faiz was given a clean chit in the Faizabad Dharna case by an inquiry commission, the army decided to investigate him months after an owner of the housing society accused him of illegally raiding his residence and stealing valuables.
Sources said Pakistan Army has decided to investigate all the cases through a high-level institutional inquiry, furthering its accountability process. “A high-level inquiry committee has been constituted under a Major General, which will look at every aspect related to this matter in detail,” sources said.
“There is a strict and highly transparent system of self-accountability in Pakistan Army and by promoting this system, all such allegations are investigated with great seriousness and those responsible are also given severe punishment so that the self-accountability of the Pakistan Army is maintained.”
On November 8, 2023, Moeez Ahmed Khan, the owner of Top City, filed a petition in the Supreme Court in which he accused Faiz of misusing his authority.
The petition filed by in the Supreme Court stated that on May 12, 2017, on the behest of Gen Faiz, ISI officials raided the top city office and his house. During the raid, valuables, including gold, diamonds and money, were seized from the house by ISI officials, the petitioner alleged.
The petition also stated that Sardar Najaf, the brother of Faiz, also contacted him to resolve the issue later.
The petition also claimed that Gen Faiz later personally met him to resolve the issue, in which he assured that some of the items which had been taken away by the ISI officials during the raid would be returned. However, 400 tolas of gold and cash will not be returned to him.
The petitioner also alleged that the ISI officials extorted Rs4 crore cash from him.
Considering the sensitivity of the matter and in view of these serious allegations, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, which included Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Qazi Faiz Isa, Justice Attar Minullah and Justice Aminuddin, heard the case.
The Supreme Court observed this was a very serious matter and the serious nature of allegations may damage the image of the entire institution, therefore the matter cannot be ignored. The Supreme Court asked the attorney general to look into the matter and discuss with the relevant authorities.
The Attorney General for Pakistan assured the apex court that full cooperation will be given to the matter and action will be taken according to law.
Following the direction, the army has constituted the inquiry committee to look into the matter.
