0,China adopts quality growth model,Pakistan can learn a lot from Chinese experiences to take economy to new highs,"China – the second-largest global economy – has officially launched “new quality productive forces” early this month to pursue high-quality development, aimed at further accelerating its economic output through deploying latest innovations and technologies where quality will take centre stage in all fields of life.
The tech advancement is expected to help introduce new industries and foster the global economy, as the share of Beijing in the world economy stood at 30% in 2023. It has been connected with around 150 nations through its aggressive Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
The quality productive forces are expected to further expand the influence of China, enabling it to challenge and change the world order, and give a tough time to competitors such as the US and India. Also, it has a lot to offer to its friends like Pakistan to spur growth.
Talking to The Express Tribune, China International Press Communication Centre Research and Media Fellow Muhammad Zamir Assadi said the new quality productive forces comprised cloud computing, Big Data, 5G advance internet, robotics, Internet of Things, high-end manufacturing and artificial intelligence.
Beijing is going to increasingly deploy innovative techniques and advanced technology, as it believes that conventional and traditional productive models have become obsolete with partial failure to perform during the Covid-19 pandemic. He said such productive forces had already become the driving force in the Chinese economy, but “this time around the focus is on quality along with quantity”. The adoption of the new model will gradually accelerate instead of coming into force overnight.
He elaborated that China had set an ambitious agenda through presenting the “Government Work Report 2024” at the annual legislators’ meeting of its two houses (parliament) held in the early days of March. Every year, the annual meeting reviews progress on plans presented last year and sets new-year agenda. The week-long meeting takes up all sectors one by one including the economy, foreign policy and social areas like healthcare and education.

This year, President Xi Jinping has launched the new quality productive forces in pursuance of high-quality development. Assadi said China achieved economic growth of 5.2% (worth 126 trillion yuan) in 2023 compared to average 7% growth in years before the pandemic and lockdowns in late 2019.
The Government Work Report has set the GDP growth target at 5% for the current year. Average growth will remain around 5% over the next four to five years, as the world is still recovering from shocks of the pandemic including high inflation. He dismissed fears that the introduction of high-quality forces would increase the cost of production and the rate of unemployment in China.
Assadi contended that the government of President Xi had remained cautious that the cost of production should not go up while applying new forces and the job market continued to flourish. The inflation measured by the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained moderate at 3% in 2023 and it is estimated to stand at low levels this year and in the future.
He said the Chinese government had targeted to create 12 million new urban jobs in 2024, indicating that the new forces would provide employment opportunities instead of rendering people jobless. In addition, the unemployment rate has got better at 5.5%, which is lower than those in Europe and the US.
Chinadaily.com reported that the concept of new quality productive forces, first coined by Xi in 2023 during an inspection in the northeast Heilongjiang province, was highlighted at a key meeting last December and became the subject of a group study session of the Communist Party of China leadership earlier this year.
In this year’s top legislature meeting, the concept dominated policy discussions in many areas and was placed as a top priority in the Government Work Report.
The Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reports that the term refers to new productive forces that emerge from continuous advances in science and technology, driving strategic future and emerging industries that could introduce breakthrough technological advancements in the era of intelligent information. Xi underscored the importance of leveraging new technologies to upgrade traditional industries and promote the high-end, intelligent and green transformation of industrial units, it said.
Assadi emphasised that the new forces of quality productivity would benefit the entire world, particularly those connected with Beijing through BRI like Pakistan, and revolutionise global growth, which had remained sluggish since the pandemic. “When China grows, the world grows and when the Chinese economy moves, the world economy moves,” he remarked.
The research and media fellow defended China, saying that it never claimed it was going to challenge the world order and had ambitions to become the superpower by achieving the title of largest economy. However, it has kept on modernising its industries and productive forces and has continued to grow since the introduction of reforms and opening up of the economy in 1978.
The high quantitative productive model (now high-quality productive model) has improved lives of 800 million people in China, bringing them above the poverty line over the past 40 years. It aggressively increased the per capita income and the purchasing power of people.
Such developments have divided the US public and private sector companies, encouraging the latter to set up businesses in China in search for the right market and right customers for their products.
World’s largest tech company Apple, based in the US, has very recently opened mega outlets in Shanghai as it believes the country, having 1.4 billion population, has the right consumers with a high purchasing power.
He was of the view that the Indian economy would never supersede China’s as a large part of population of the former still lives below the poverty line, sleeps at the roadside and many have no access to toilets.
He, however, stressed that Pakistan could learn a lot from the Chinese growth models and experiences, and lift its economy to new highs, as Beijing has always remained supportive of Islamabad.
China can assist Pakistan at length to fix the agriculture sector in line with its own efforts that lifted millions of people from below the poverty line in the recent past. Pakistan may also welcome the ageing industries of China to ramp up exports.
China has already invested around $30 billion in the past 10 years under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) by setting up 8,000 megawatts of electricity generation plants, which helped address load-shedding and brought production activities back to normal in industries.

1,Billions can be earned via agri-trade liberalisation,It will be realised under SIFC umbrella as protectionism bears no fruit,"Economic liberalisation, no intervention, no subsidies and least regulation are the key to the success of countries that emerged as global export leaders after the 1980s. Unfortunately, Pakistan didn’t accept it wholeheartedly.
For the past 34 years, I have observed a pervasive fixed mindset of the bureaucracy, not ready to learn the good for change. They are indulged in the romance of maintaining the status quo and going slow.
This deep-rooted culture is one of the major causes of our economic corrosion. SIFC can make them vibrant and help learn a market-based approach, become disciplined and make quick decisions.
Reshuffling blended with private sector professionals is a must for capacity building of the Masters in History.
Bureaucracy is following the orthodox policies of intervention of the 1950s to control farming, business, and industries. As a result, neither agriculture nor industry could flourish in the past 76 years.
Since decades, the country has been growing four major crops – wheat, cotton, rice and sugarcane – and now maize has been added as the fifth key crop.
Except for cotton, the other four major crops are of low value ranging from $200 to $400 per ton. Some 90% of growers are small landholders having three to 12 acres of land.
Arable land is shrinking owing to the setting up of housing societies on the main alluvial fertile land, but unfortunately we are not developing or reclaiming more land.
Exports of China, India, Singapore, the UAE and many other countries have increased as they import raw material and raw agro commodities. Some are exporting goods via third country. Singapore’s 85% of exports are made through the third country and Dubai is also following Singapore’s export model.
Pakistan’s policymakers talk about agro-based value-added industries but they don’t realise that running an industry on a seasonal domestic produce is not feasible unless it runs throughout the year, gets local raw material in off-season as well as via imports.
In case a domestic crop faces shortfall due to climate change or it is become economically unviable to add value, industries may get uninterrupted imported raw material. For instance, fresh tomato value-added industries are not feasible because of the local seasonal produce hence the country is bound to import.

Sesame seeds are exported mostly in natural (un-hulled) form during the season when prices are competitive internationally but hulled sesame and edible sesame oil are not among our regular export items.
Sesame oil industries or the export of hulled sesame seeds for bakeries can remain continue throughout the year provided if we adopt an open import policy, allow duty and tax-free import of raw sesame seeds, like the way India is doing for many agro commodities such as pulses, raw cashew nut, sesame seeds, etc.
Exporters are timorous and are reluctant to invest in Export Processing Zones or avail themselves of the Duty and Tax Remission for Export scheme as well as Export Finance Scheme as cumbersome rules discourage them.
Once Afghanistan was Pakistan’s largest export destination but now others have taken over this market. We increased import tax on Afghanistan’s produce, which found way into India, Iran and China.
Before the increase in taxes on Afghan goods, Pakistan was exporting agricultural commodities. Instead of retaliating by slapping import duties, we need to allow tax-free imports of Afghan produce under Chapter 7 and sign a selective free trade agreement with Iran to curb smuggling.
The minimum support price policy was introduced in the late 1950s but except for a few years, the country faced wheat crisis several times, though it hiked the support price from Rs9.50 per 40 kg in 1952-53 to Rs4,000 in 2024.
The intervention through the support price, procurement of wheat for building strategic stocks and export subsidy made vulnerable the supply chain of this strategic staple crop. This policy neither helped growers nor consumers, who could not get flour at affordable prices, but surely the subsidy doled out by the government reached into the deep pockets of flour millers.
The millers always grind wheat to produce more fine flour (Maida) to sell at a premium to biscuit factories, bakeries, sweet, pizza, noodles and pasta sellers, and supply a less quantity of 2.5-grade flour for the ordinary consumers.
The minimum support price has failed to make the country self-sufficient in wheat, cotton and sugar, which we are compelled to import at regular intervals.
This support price could not change lives of small landholding growers with less than 12 acres of land but the public exchequer is bearing a burden of Rs630 billion to finance the commodities’ operation.
If the support price policy is shifted from wheat, cotton and sugarcane to the high-value minor crops, Pakistan can not only become self-sufficient but can emerge as a major exporter of these crops.
Support price for oilseeds like canola, soybean, sesame, mustard, sunflower, peanuts, pulses legumes, fennel, Ajwain, cumin, turmeric, coriander, Dandicut round chilli, flax seeds and Tukmaria (Tukham Balango) can help to increase the production of these high-value crops valuing in the range of $1,000 to $6,000 per ton.
By abandoning the old-fashioned wheat policy, the government should allow the private sector to enter the arena like it did in the case of rice.
Pakistan’s agricultural and food security is increasingly dependent on imports and imported hybrid seeds, therefore, it needs to develop indigenous seeds and most importantly open pollinated varieties. This will enable growers to use in-house graded and healthy seeds and reduce the high cost of hybrid seeds, which are one of the main causes behind high food inflation and elevated prices of rice, garlic, fresh vegetables and fruits.
The DG Green Pakistan Initiative may call a meeting of agricultural research institutes, which number around 200 and are working in the centre and provinces.
These institutes have become white elephants, enjoying salaries, perks and free housing but their performance is next to nothing. For instance, a tea plantation project, initiated in the 1950s, did not deliver any satisfactory results.

2,Will provinces shoulder Pakistan’s debt burden?,Political parties will resist such measures as they disrupt free lunches and lavish spending,"As we finalise the details of the next International Monetary Fund (IMF) facility to secure economic stability, pertinent questions and concerns arise.
IMF support is vital for the country to address internal challenges and chart its path to prosperity. Amidst this, various discussions are emerging, stirring political scrutiny. A significant issue at hand is ensuring the federal government’s financial sustainability.
Predictably, given the high interest rates, almost all tax revenues are diverted to servicing loan “interest,” making us net borrowers from day one and exacerbating bankruptcy. Inaction is simply not viable. Major decisions are imperative to halt this drain on resources.
The current political landscape intertwines long-standing political dynasties, obliging them to safeguard both their own interests and the state’s simultaneously. Debates regarding the National Finance Commission (NFC) award and wealth distribution between the federal and provincial levels are entirely justified.
Upon close observation, the current NFC structure has disproportionately empowered provinces, to the extent that a mere two years of poor governance at the federal level can propel the country towards the brink of default.
Despite the earlier enactment of fiscal debt restraining laws, persistent breaches have occurred without repercussions, reflecting a lack of remorse or urgency among policymakers. This apathy persists as the elite class manipulates the lives of the remaining 99%.
While the revenue side of the equation may remain unchanged, expenses must be jointly shared.
Hence, it is imperative for provinces to shoulder their own burdens independently. Joint responsibilities should only be shared at the federal level, akin to parental guidance.
The provinces, as mature entities, must bear the expenses of their own households. This includes areas such as Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), education, healthcare, DISCO losses, agricultural tube well subsidy, impact of minimum crop support prices, and lending via National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), all of which should be managed through provincial banks.
In their defence, provinces should impose taxes on provincial matters and services to ensure self-sufficiency and foster bottom-up growth.
Political parties will undoubtedly resist such measures as they disrupt the status quo of free lunches and lavish spending. Historically, the federal government would impose taxes and allocate a significant portion to reckless endeavours, resulting in wasteful job creation and unnecessary development splurges.

There must be transparency for voters to track the allocation of funds designated for development/sustainable development goals (SDGs). Every expenditure by public offices should be mirrored by private sector involvement to enhance efficiency, promote meritocracy, and ensure mutually beneficial project outcomes.
Public sector investment should primarily serve as a catalyst for long-term sustainable growth in the country.
Pakistan might manage to sustain a nominal 1-2% per capita GDP growth over the next three to four years, accompanied by a marginal reduction in domestic and external debt. However, such an outcome would signify a disgraceful failure for a country abundant in talent, determination, and resources.
Frankly, we do not require additional motorways, vast universities, or grandiose infrastructure projects merely aimed at garnering votes from the emotionally patriotic yet undereducated segments of Pakistani society.
To truly make progress, we must prioritise investment in mass education and healthcare. The IMF’s medium-term bailout is akin to providing a village with roads and electricity – while beneficial, it’s insufficient for sustainable prosperity.
It’s imperative to educate and equip men and women working in agriculture with basic digital skills, enabling them to access exportable “data entry” level jobs and earn above the barely enforced minimum wage of Rs30,000-Rs35,000 per month.
We must focus on increasing exports in IT-related services and other value-added industries such as pharmaceuticals, dairy, meat, and cell phones, fostering job creation and economic growth at a rate of 15-20% annually.
Ending the cycle of free money in real estate for the privileged few will unlock the potential. Only through exports can we ensure a sustainable 15-25% return on equity for investors in the long run.
The spiralling currency, shocking interest rates, and exorbitant taxes on compliant documented sectors have stifled Pakistan’s growth for a decade. This is not acceptable, nor deserved by Pakistanis.
Another one or two years of poor governance in the current account/fiscal debt could lead to an economic tailspin akin to situations seen in Venezuela, Argentina, Lebanon, and some poorer African countries.
We cannot rely on the IMF to show us how to thrive; their role is to provide support as we stand on our own feet. It’s up to us to pave our path to prosperity.

3,IMF programme: is there an alternative?,"PM can say no to new IMF loan, start domestically owned ‘Reform and Growth Programme’","The review of IMF’s standby arrangement (SBA) is complete, and Pakistan is now seeking another IMF programme with the aim of “permanently resolving its fiscal and external sustainability weaknesses, strengthening economic recovery, and laying the foundations for a strong, sustainable, and inclusive growth”. This is expected to be the 25th IMF programme.
Can an IMF programme “permanently” solve our economic problems? Is there an alternative to this? And if there is an alternative, what it would be? As Dr Nadeemul Haque and others have rightly expressed many times, an IMF programme should be considered like an ICU (Intensive Care Unit). A patient cannot be permanently kept in an ICU and should graduate to a normal ward and be discharged back to a healthy life.
No patient should be happy by living permanently in an ICU and no professional doctor will allow it.
Countries do encounter balance of payments crisis, which are often but not exclusively rooted in fiscal policies. If Pakistan as an economic patient is again asking to be admitted in an ICU, as the prime minister has already announced, one thing is certain: we are not taking our prescribed medicines seriously. However, let’s also consider the other possibility: the doctor is not professional. The patient is seeking admission to the ICU with the same diagnosis, for the 25th time!
This is what the IMF press release highlights as the key objectives of the anticipated 25th programme: Strengthening public finances, energy sector viability, returning inflation to target, flexible forex market, private sector-led activity, SOE (state-owned enterprises) reforms, and investment in human capital.
This is a familiar list. One conclusion should be straight forward: previous treatments have failed.
IMF programmes have not resulted in an efficient public finance system despite legislations, a viable energy market despite significant tariff escalation, taming inflation despite discount rate hikes, stable forex rate despite securing central bank autonomy, privatisation despite all planning, and educated and healthy workforce despite spending more resources through devolution.
If history is any guide, another IMF programme will not itself resolve our problems. Now, we come to the next question: is there an alternative to the next IMF programme? If this is just a question of meeting external funding gaps, my short answer would be yes.
Read ‘Longer IMF programme could lead to debt trap’
Pakistan’s external situation is vulnerable but not disastrous. IMF, after its first review of SBA, scaled down projections of external funding requirements to around $25 billion, though later estimates indicate $27 billion as well. While this is the total requirement, the gap was estimated to be $6.5 billion during this fiscal year and is likely to be in the same range next year as well.
This gap can be bridged by non-debt inflows such as increased exports, remittances, and foreign direct investment. Roshan Digital Accounts can also help. We do not need debt-creating inflows, including the IMF. On the other hand, if the question is posed again and one asks, does our government have an alternative reform programme, the answer will be no. There have been some efforts by other institutions such as the PIDE Reform Manifesto and the PRIME Charter of Economy.
Our lenders, including the IMF, should understand this simple rule: a government which seeks external loans only as a budgetary support measure, rather than for economically viable projects, has failed to bring its own house into order.
Providing more loans to such a government just provides it with a negative incentive to avoid reforms. It creates a moral hazard. The loans provided in the garb of institutional reforms, therefore, should be discontinued. The FBR and the government of Pakistan owe an explanation to the country’s taxpayers: what is the result of a $700 million loan, counting both the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which was contracted in the name of FBR reforms? Why these institutions keep on lending us?
Fiscal prudence lies at the centre of the IMF programme. Excessive government spending requires borrowing, which not only increases inflation but also crowds out the private sector.
When we have already committed to move towards a balanced budget in our constitution, why do we need to sign up a new IMF programme? We have the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act 2005 and the Public Finance Management Act 2019 as well as the State Bank Autonomy Act 2021.
This legislative framework is sufficient to define fiscal boundaries of the federal government, which are further enforced by the NFC Award, that should be respected.
With a comfortable majority in parliament, and backed by the military establishment, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has a golden opportunity to say no to a new IMF programme and start a domestically and politically owned “National Reform & Growth Programme”.
This, however, should not be decided by in-house committees and should not be done in a rush. It needs national and open debate, with extensive participation from all stakeholders.
Ultimately, it is parliament which needs to take the ownership and steer our country to a prosperous future.

4,Priorities for new government,"While digitalisation is imperative across all depts, it is most critical for FBR","The new government’s steadfast commitment to economic revival and proactive approach to building upon the groundwork laid by the caretaker administration are encouraging signs.
The government’s swift action in initiating negotiations with the IMF for another loan programme is necessary to address the substantial external financial deficit and prevent a repeat of the past six years’ default scenario. This marks a significant departure from previous practices, where new administrations often delayed similar actions for months for political reasons.
Another astute government decision is the appointment of Muhammad Aurangzeb as its finance minister. This choice offers numerous advantages.
Among his achievements in his previous role as the head of Habib Bank, he spearheaded extensive digitalisation efforts, facilitated increased funding for the modernisation of agriculture, and fostered collaboration with the Bank of China to leverage CPEC for enhancing Pakistan’s regional and global integration.
Pakistan is significantly behind in these areas at the national level. While digitalisation is imperative across all government departments, the most critical needs are those of the FBR. Its performance has been much below par.
Almost one-third of the revenue is estimated to be lost due to tax evasion. Only 3.6% of the population files tax returns, with half declaring no taxable income.
It would greatly ease the FBR’s borrow-to-improve problem if its tax collection, at 8.5% of GDP, were brought on a par with India’s, which is almost double at 17%.
Read New government and the challenges
We could seek assistance from Singapore’s tax digitisation efforts, where filing and payment processes have been simplified to such an extent that three-fourths of individual taxpayers benefit from a no-filing service with pre-filled data fields.
At Habib Bank, Aurangzeb’s other major achievement was the establishment of a dedicated subsidiary, HBL Zarai Services Limited. With its financial resources and efficiency, this institution will make a significant contribution to the government’s recent initiatives for catalysing the second Green Revolution.
Pakistan currently imports $10 billion of edible oils and other food products. The greater focus on agriculture should not only bring us self-sufficiency but also position us to significantly elevate our agricultural exports.
During the last eight months, exports of food products jumped by 54%, or from $3.2 billion in FY 2023, to $5.97 billion in FY 2024. There is a need to build on this momentum.
If the Netherlands, which is 19 times smaller in size compared to Pakistan, can export over $100 billion worth of agricultural products, there is no reason why Pakistan, with its much better climate, should not be able to export at least $30 billion of agricultural products.
Aurangzeb, leveraging his years of experience working there, can utilise his knowledge and connections to attract joint ventures with Dutch companies.
Another forward-thinking initiative led by Aurangzeb was establishing a formal strategic partnership between Habib Bank and the Bank of China. This partnership aims to enhance economic empowerment and regional connectivity, fostering seamless trade opportunities across South Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa.
Achieving regional connectivity at the national level necessitates the shifting of Pakistan’s economic outlook from inward-looking to outward-looking. Currently, Pakistan ranks as the world’s seventh most protected and inward-looking economy, with import tariffs nearly twice as high as the global average and three times higher than those in East Asia (World Bank).
Opening up the economy poses a significant challenge from the vested interests, but during our lifetime, many Asian leaders have successfully transformed their nations. There is no reason why Pakistan cannot achieve similar success.
Over the last five years, the World Bank has conducted significant work in this area and has developed a roadmap for modernising Pakistan’s trade policy. Their key findings suggest the necessity of comprehensive import tariff reforms and reducing trading costs.
A World Bank team is currently collaborating with the Customs administration on a new digital management system to fully modernise the clearance system, aiming to reduce time and costs. Pakistan Single Window has already considerably facilitated cross-border trade, replacing manual processes with digitalisation.
However, there have been no initiatives thus far to embark on import tariff reforms. Without substantial reforms in this area, Pakistan risks remaining isolated. We stand on the brink of transformation. There’s a growing awareness that we must fundamentally alter our existing policies and resource allocation.
Given the enormity of the task, the government ought not to hesitate in leveraging the expertise of outstanding technocrats from the caretaker setup, who have demonstrated a remarkable ability to swiftly transform the outlook and economic performance from despair to optimism.
Embracing such an arrangement would not only ensure continuity but also accelerate the pace of reform, thereby propelling the nation towards sustained progress.
