0,Aitchison College principal resigns over 'preferential treatment',"Politics and nepotism have no place in schools, says outgoing principal","Aitchison College Principal Michael A Thompson submitted his resignation on Monday, alleging 'unwarranted interference and brazen directives' from the Punjab government regarding fee waivers for Ahad Cheema’s sons.
The resignation came after Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman allegedly ordered the principal to waive the fees of Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Cheema's sons – Esa and Mustafa Ahad Cheema.
After completing an eight-year tenure, the 18th principal of the prestigious institution penned a heartfelt resignation addressed to his staff.

 
The outgoing principal said he strived to maintain the school’s reputation while practising compassion. However, he pointed out that he was compelled to accommodate ""certain individuals"" who engaged in ""blatant policy manufacturing"" within the school management system.
“Politics and nepotism have no place in schools,” the letter read.
Highlighting recent actions by Governor House, the principal noted, ""Over the past year, other prejudiced actions by Governor House have contributed to a breakdown of governance and management"".
“A well-intentioned foreigner does not venture to another country with less than pure intent,” said Thompson and concluded the resignation with a blessing for Pakistan and its citizens.

'Shifting to Islamabad'
The federal minister stated that “the issue of fee waiver is being ""presented in a different light”.
Cheema claimed that his family, including his wife and two children, are shifting to Islamabad and hence had requested the fee to be waived. Cheema claimed his sons were still issued the fee challans.
The minister maintained that no one should pay fees after leaving the school.
He further claimed that Principal Thompson had already submitted his resignation and was only expected to serve until August 2024.
Cheema added a committee for hiring a new principal has already been formed.
The order released from the Governor’s Secretariat Punjab, in response to a request filed by the wife of Ahad Cheema, Saima Ahad Cheema, stated to ‘review’ the decision concerning the reservation of seats and leave of absence granted to her sons.


Saima Cheema pleaded that being a civil servant and ‘salaried’ class, she was unable to pay the dues of both Aitchison College and the prospective school the children were to be admitted to after the family moved to Islamabad.
Founded in 1886, Aitchison is one of the oldest and most prestigious educational institutes in Pakistan. The sitting governor of Punjab has a say in the affairs of the college as the president of the board of governors.

1,Bureaucratic upheaval expected in K-P,The PTI-SIC’s demands of transfers of key officials of the provincial bureaucracy are yet to be entertained,"With the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) backed independents securing a majority in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), and the party, which is now associated with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), assuming power for the third consecutive term in the province, significant changes in key bureaucratic positions are expected.
In this regard, Member National Assembly (MNA), Sher Afzal Marwat, a senior leader of the PTI, recently told journalists that discussions had taken place with the party’s founding Chairman, Imran Khan, who advocated for a change in key bureaucrats of the province and a change in leadership of the provincial police force.
After Marwat’s presser, demands for the transfer of high-ranking police officials, including the Inspector General (IG) of K-P, Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, have intensified within the PTI ranks, which includes former ministers Taimur Jhagra and Kamran Bangash, who want an overhaul of the administrative setup of the province and the provincial capital, Peshawar. Speaking to the Express Tribune, former information minister, Bangash, said that the election was rigged with the connivance of Deputy Commissioner Peshawar and his team.
“Therefore, until these government officials are transferred, PTI’s protest will continue.” It is also pertinent to mention that recently K-P’s Chief Minister, Ali Amin Gandapur, met with the Prime Minister, Shahbaz Sharif, to discuss the transfer of the provincial police chief and other top bureaucrats.

Sources privy to the developments informed the Express Tribune that after the meeting the K-P government requested that Shahab Ali Shah, who served as the Additional Chief Secretary during former chief minister Mehmood Khan’s tenure, be appointed as the Chief Secretary of the province. While it remains to be seen whether Shah will be posted as Chief Secretary; amidst these calls for a complete upheaval, concerns regarding the lack of prioritisation of governance issues by the new government have increased.
For instance, Ahmed Kundi, the Parliamentary Leader of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) in the K-P Assembly, was of the view that if the incumbent government engages in a scuffle with the federation over transfers, then there would be no time for governance.
“The government needs to address fundamental challenges facing the province, such as the demand from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reassess provincial shares and the recent controversial appointment in the Indus River System Authority,” emphasised Kundi. Similarly, Dr Ibadullah, the Opposition Leader in the K-P Assembly, highlighted a disconnect between the PTI's current rhetoric and its previous acclaim of the province's police force.
""In the elections of 2013 and 2018, Tehreek-e-Insaf praised K-P police as exemplary police everywhere, in every street, in every meeting. Imran Khan himself kept singing the praises of the K-P police in the 2018 rallies, but how did the police, which was apparently so good in the province for 10 years, deteriorate in 10 months?"" Dr Ibadullah questioned.“The answer is that the PTI has ruined the bureaucracy in the province. Therefore, the PTI should now focus on issues of the province, rather than making demands,” suggested Dr Ibadullah while talking to the Express Tribune.

2,"Gaza protesters, police clash near red-zone","JI, Safe Gaza Movement accuse ‘pro-Israel govt’ of inaction amid a genocide","Protestors belonging to the JI and Gaza Bachao Tehreek—Save Gaza Movement—on Sunday clashed with police as the former tried to enter Islamabad’s red-zone to protest against the government’s inaction amid a brutal genocide of beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza.
Former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan led the protest demonstration on behalf of the JI. The Save Gaza Movement was represented by its central leader Humera Tayyaba.
Upon the gathering of demonstrators, the police closed the gate leading to D-Chowk to prevent them from moving towards the Parliament House.
Mushtaq Ahmad Khan held negotiations with the Federal Police SSP Abdul Aleem and requested permission to proceed towards the red-zone.
However, the police officers refused to grant permission for the demonstrators to enter the red-zone, which led to a confrontation between the protesters and the police.
According to the JI spokesperson, the police baton-charged peaceful protesters, resulting in injuries to some JI workers. As a result, the protesters also pelted stones at the police.
The protestors later staged a six-hour long sit-in near D-Chowk and broke their fast on the street. They announced staging a similar sit-in at the same place also next Sunday.
Addressing the protesters on this occasion, Save Gaza Movement’s Humera Tayyaba said that this campaign was initiated to put pressure on Israel at the global level.
She said countries including the United States, the UK and some countries in the Middle East are supporting this genocide of the people of Gaza at the hands of Israel.
“We protested in seven cities, but the Pakistan government turned a deaf ear to us. It is shameful that today we have been intimidated and threatened. We will either stage a sit-in here or go to jail,” she said.
JI’s Mushtaq Ahmad Khan said their movement has a specific agenda, which is solely to save Gaza. He said the people of Gaza are breaking their fasts on the debris of their demolished houses but this “pro-Israel” government is trying to stop the protestors.
“We are ready to go to jail. We will go to D-Chowk in any case. The police should be immediately removed,” he said.
The JI leader claimed that the protest was in accordance with the resolutions passed in parliament against Israeli atrocities in Gaza. He said the government first passes a resolution but when people take to the streets to implement that resolution it resorts to intimidation.
Lambasting the prominent leaders of the Muslim world including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for their alleged inaction, he asked if these leaders are awaiting the death of the entire Gaza population.
He urged the army chief to mobilize the army to protect Palestinians. He said Pakistan should immediately play its role in the ceasefire.
“File a case against Israel's crimes in the International Court of Justice, initiate hearings in the UN Security Council against Israel's war crimes, and issue a demarche to the US ambassador.
“I am saddened that today the police have surrounded us to arrest us. We have come here for the sake of innocent children, but the government is putting up obstacles. We condemn and will continue to condemn the actions of Israel, America, and Europe,” he said.Meanwhile, speaking to the media in Jaranwala, JI chief Sirajul Haq asserted that those who reach assemblies by stealing the public mandate will soon be forced to return to their homes. Haq said the back-breaking inflation has made life difficult for the people.

4,JCP drafts rules to fill SC vacancies,Proposed draft of the JCP Rules 2024 disseminated among all members for careful consideration.," 
The rules-making committee of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) has proposed that the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), as chairman of the committee, suggest three candidates for each vacancy in the Supreme Court.
The committee, chaired by the CJP, has recommended that three individuals be suggested for each vacancy in the Supreme Court. Furthermore, it has proposed that the three-member selection committee initiate nominations for high court judges.
The proposed draft of the JCP Rules 2024 has been disseminated among all JCP members for their careful consideration.
On December 4, 2023, the JCP established a committee chaired by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah including Justice retired Manzoor Ahmad Malik to review the amendments to the JCP Rules 2010.
The committee comprised senior puisne judges from all high courts, along with the attorney general for Pakistan and the law minister, totaling 15 members.
Subsequently, the committee convened two meetings to deliberate on the proposed amendments to the JCP rules.
""For the appointment of a Judge of the Supreme Court, the Chairperson shall propose three persons for each vacancy as per criteria prescribed and convene a meeting of the Commission for deliberation not later than fifteen days before the occurrence of the vacancy. Thereafter, the Commission, shall nominate, by majority one person against a vacancy to the Parliamentary Committee under clause (8) of Article e175A of the Constitution,” read the JCP’s proposed rules.
As for the appointment of the chief justice of a high court, it suggested that the chairperson – CJP – shall convene a meeting of the commission for deliberation on the names of the five most senior judges of that high court one month before the occurrence of the vacancy.
“Thereafter, the commission, shall nominate, by majority, one person to be appointed as the chief justice of a high court to the Parliamentary Committee under clause (8) of Article 175A of the Constitution.”
For the appointment of judges of the high courts, the proposed rule says that the Chairperson (CJP) shall call for nominations from the selection committee concerned not later than sixty days, and convene a meeting of the commission for deliberation on the nominations not later than thirty days, before the occurrence of the vacancy.
Thereafter, it stated, that the commission, shall nominate, by majority, one person against a vacancy to the Parliamentary Committee under clause (8) of Article 175A of the Constitution.
It was also stated that concerning the appointment of the chief justice of the Federal Shariat Court, the chairperson would put forward two nominees.
A commission meeting would then be convened to deliberate on these names one month before the vacancy.
Subsequently, the commission would, by majority vote, nominate one individual to assume the position of chief justice of the FSC, forwarding the nomination to the parliamentary committee in accordance with clause (8) of Article 175A of the Constitution.""For the appointment of the Judges of the Federal Shariat Court, the Chairperson shall in consultation with the Chief Justice FSC and the senior most judge nominate two persons for each vacancy and convene a meeting of the commission for deliberation on those names not later than fifteen, days before the occurrence of the vacancy. Thereafter, the Commission, shall nominate, by majority, one person against a vacancy to the Parliamentary Committee,"" the draft read.High courts judges
The committee has suggested the selection committee for each high. The selection committee will be consisted of the chief justice concerned, the senior most judge of the high court and one representative of the provincial bar council.
Until the nominated representative of the Islamabad Bar Council is made a member of the commission by an amendment in clause (6) of Article 175A of the Constitution, the appointment of judges of the Islamabad High Court, the selection committee shall only consist of the chief justice and the most senior judge of that court.
The committee stated that the chief justice of the respective high court would serve as the chairperson, while the court's registrar would act as the secretary of the selection committee. The secretary of the committee would provide assistance to the committee and its members in fulfilling their duties, as well as maintaining a record of its proceedings.
In relation to establishing criteria, the proposed draft states that to assess the suitability of an individual for a judicial appointment, primary emphasis shall be placed on the criteria delineated in the judicial oath outlined in the constitution. This entails the individual's capacity to dispense justice impartially, in accordance with the law, devoid of fear, favouritism, personal affection, or prejudice.
Additionally, the candidate's professional qualifications, experience, communication abilities, efficiency in managing workload, integrity, independence, objectivity, and temperament to treat individuals from diverse backgrounds fairly shall all be taken into consideration.
""Provided that in nominating Judges of the High Courts for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court, the seniority among Judges of a High Court as well as inter se seniority of Judges of different High Courts shall also be considered.”
About the representation of advocates and members of the district judiciary, it stated that in initiating nominations for appointment of judges of the high courts, the selection committees shall ensure a fair representation of advocates and members of the district judiciary.

6,K-P seeks access for Elahi’s medical tests,Saif wants reassurance PTI president wasn’t tortured," 
A Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government official on Sunday expressed his concerns over the reports of alleged torture on PTI President Chaudhry Parvez Elahi in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail and demanded that his province’s team of doctors should be given permission to conduct his medical examination.
In a statement, K-P Information Adviser Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif claimed that the Punjab government's attitude towards the former chief minister of the province in prison was “alarming”.
According to Elahi’s medical report presented to a court by the jail authorities on Thursday, the PTI leader had a nasty fall in the prison’s washroom on March 17 and broken four ribs.
Following this report, a special court for anti-corruption delay¬¬ed Elahi’s indictment and other suspects in a case of alleged illegal appointments made in the Punjab Assembly and adjourned the hearing till April 4.
However, the detailed medical report outlined a series of injuries sustained by the former chief minister in addition to the broken ribs.
Elahi reportedly suffered an injury to his forehead during the fall, with visible marks noted on the left side of his head. Furthermore, there were injuries near his left eye and on his left arm, while swelling was observed on the right side of his chest. Additionally, Elahi’s left knee was found to be injured.
The PTI president underwent thorough medical examinations conducted by doctors from PIMS Islamabad and Benazir Bhutto Hospital Rawalpindi, including specialists in general surgery, cardiology, and orthopaedics.
The doctors advised Elahi to observe a two-week rest to facilitate his recovery.
“We want to reassure ourselves that he [Elahi] actually fell and suffered injuries or was tortured,” Saif wrote in the statement.
He claimed that the K-P government was deeply concerned that Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was having political opponents “tortured” out of “personal vendetta”.
Saif continued that the K-P government was worried about the safety of PTI founding chairman Imran Khan, Elahi as well as other party leaders and activists incarcerated in Punjab’s jails.
He warned the Punjab chief minister that she would have to face criminal cases if any evidence that Elahi was tortured was found.
The provincial information adviser added that the K-P government intended to take all kinds of legal action if its medical team was not given access to the PTI president.

8,"Senate nominations reek of nepotism, familial ties","Party workers have been sidelined once more, just like they were for the general elections","In the run-up to the Senate elections scheduled for the first week of April, the political landscape across Pakistan is once again being dominated by familiar faces and family ties rather than merit-based selections.
The trend is evident across Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), and Balochistan, reflecting a nationwide phenomenon of prioritising personal relationships and dynastic politics over a democratic process.
In Sindh, where the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) holds sway, the distribution of Senate tickets underscores the influence of personal connections within the party. For instance, senior party leader and former chairman Senate, Mian Raza Rabbani, has been omitted from the list of candidates, signalling a departure from merit-based selections.
Instead, tickets have been allocated to individuals with familial ties or close associations, such as Nadeem Bhutto and Quratulain Marri.
Reflecting on this trend, political analyst Shahab Usto highlighted the prevalence of a political culture rooted in nepotism and familial affiliations. “Pakistan’s political parties mostly distribute tickets on the basis of family terms and personal relationships,” remarked Usto.
Therefore, he emphasised the need for strengthening democratic norms within political parties to mitigate such practices.A similar pattern has been witnessed in Punjab, where influential figures and Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) loyalists, like Mohsin Naqvi and Ahad Cheema, are being favoured for Senate nominations.
In this regard, Dr Hassan Askari, a political analyst with a keen eye on Punjab’s politics, noted that the selection process had sidelined party workers in favour of individuals with personal connections to party leaders, which perpetuated a cycle of dynastic politics.
Dr Askari stated: ""Tickets, whether they be for the Senate elections or other elections, are issued only to the influential, in a clear rebuke for grass roots party workers.”Likewise, in K-P, the Senate race mirrors the hereditary politics witnessed in the recently held general elections.
Traditional political families continue to assert their influence, with established figures securing nominations over grassroots party members. Notable examples include Faisal Javed and Azam Khan Swati of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), who have received repeated Senate tickets despite criticism.
This apparent nepotism in the upper house has drawn scrutiny from senior parliamentarians and former senators, who lament the erosion of meritocracy and the influx of inexperienced individuals.
In this regard, former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who is associated with the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), opined that the importance of the Senate as a platform for provincial representation and legislative oversight was being ignored. “In recent times we have seen that financiers or ATMs and black money holders have bought their way into the Senate either by their influence or familial ties.
Consequently, the standard of the Senate has deteriorated,” asserted Khan.“This is evidenced by the fact that the debates in the Senate are now mainly focused on mudslinging. And the Senate will continue to be little more than a protocol house unless intelligent, honest, and competent individuals join it,” he added.
Senior politician, Zahid Khan, who has been a member of the Senate in 1997 and 2007, echoed Khan’s sentiments by expressing concern over the dilution of the Senate's role due to the influx of inexperienced and non-political individuals.
He warned that the Senate was at a risk of losing its significance if it was not populated by seasoned lawmakers committed to upholding democratic principles. ""Gone are the times when the upper house of Parliament was focused on public issues,"" regretted Khan while talking to The Express Tribune.
