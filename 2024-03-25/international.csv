Currently, cheques worth Rs10,000 have been disbursed to one lakh families, with plans to extend aid to the remaining eligible families soon.
Minister Toru underscored the government’s unwavering commitment to serving the general public, aligning closely with the agenda of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government in the province and its founder, Imran Khan. He emphasized the necessity of concrete actions over mere rhetoric, reiterating the government’s dedication to public service.

He emphasized that stringent directives have been issued to ensure compliance and uphold food standards, reflecting the government’s proactive approach to safeguarding public health.
The Ramazan Relief Program, according to Toru, aims to alleviate the financial burdens on deserving families during the holy month, showcasing the government’s prioritization of citizen welfare.
Highlighting the distribution process, Zareef Ul Muani, Secretary of the Food Department, emphasized that the distribution of cheques under the Ramazan Relief Program is accessible through all branches of Bank Alfalah across the province.
In a press statement on March 15, Barrister Dr Mohammad Ali Saif, Advisor to the Chief Minister on Information and Public Relations, announced the release of funds for the Ramazan package by the finance department. 
He reiterated that the Ramazan package is specifically intended for low-income families, with all relevant matters settled with a private bank.
Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, during a press briefing after a recent cabinet meeting, announced a Rs10,000 Ramazan package for deserving families, demonstrating the government’s proactive efforts to provide relief during these challenging times.
During its inaugural meeting on March 8, the cabinet took a significant step by approving a relief package for the needy populace during the holy month of Ramazan. This package, aimed at assisting 850,000 households already listed in Ehsas and BISP, entails providing Rs10,000 per household, amounting to a total cost of Rs8.5 billion. Additionally, 115,000 additional households, not covered by the aforementioned programs for various reasons, will also receive Rs10,000 per household.
During the meeting, Chief Minister Ali Amin emphasized the government’s commitment to promoting employment opportunities, with a focus on skill development for the youth. To facilitate this, interest-free loans will be provided, enabling individuals to start their own businesses according to their skills and capabilities. He reiterated the government’s dedication to utilizing available resources for the welfare of the people.
Chief Minister Ali Amin also addressed the issue of provincial rights, stating that the matter would be pursued with the Centre. He expressed hope for the media’s support in this endeavor.
Regarding the outstanding dues owed to the province, Chief Minister Ali Amin emphasized that Rs1,510 billion, in accordance with the net hydel power profit (as per the AGN Qazi Formula), are due from the federal government. 
He stressed that this substantial amount could greatly assist the province in overcoming financial challenges. He clarified that the province isn’t seeking charity but rather its rightful and constitutional dues.

3,Bara police set up women’s desk,Inaugurated by IGP Akhtar Hayat Khan along with the appointment of female staff,"A women’s desk had been established in Khyber’s Bara police station in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to quickly resolve complaints of womenfolk. The desk, after being established earlier this year, has registered at least 15 cases.
The cases range from domestic violence, education, marriage, deprivation of inheritance rights, honour killing and others. The outcome of the desk can be seen positively with most case rulings in favour of women.
The desk was formally inaugurated by IGP Akhtar Hayat Khan along with the appointment of female staff including desk officer Fatima Afridi.
Fatima told The Express Tribune that cases pertaining to multiple issues were entertained but in a strange turn of events, a case of the obsolete tradition of ‘Ghag’ was also registered. Ghag means a custom, usage, tradition or practice whereby a person forcibly demands or claims the hand of a woman, without her own or her parents’ or wali’s will and free consent, by making an open declaration either by words spoken or written or by visible.
The officer added that the initiative is seen as a ray of hope for women deprived of justice which ensures satisfaction at every stage. IGP Hayat Khan said that there was a need to have multiple gender desks to entertain Khyber’s women population, which numbers more than 0.6 million.
He added that awareness regarding the importance of the gender desk was also necessary to make the initiative helpful in real terms.
District Police Officer (DPO) Khyber, Salim Abbas Kalachi said access to justice for every man and woman is the basic characteristic of a civilized society, adding that women seeking justice were earlier seen as untraditional.
He added that they remain committed to recruiting more women police officers to back the initiative and have more gender desks in the region.
