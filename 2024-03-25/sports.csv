0,Peasant's body doubts credibility of Kissan Card,HWA says farmers not owning 12 acres of land will be unable to benefit from the initiative,"Hari Welfare Association (HWA), a non-profit organisation working for the rights of peasants, has contended that the Sindh government's Kissan Card initiative is unlikely to benefit the farm workers who do not own land. 
The association's president Akram Khaskheli said in a statement on Monday that the peasants who mostly offer their labour to the landlords on the basis of sharing crops will not be able to avail the card.
Through the card, which was one of the promises made during the election campaign by Pakistan Peoples Party's Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the farmers will receive subsidies, loans and insurance in addition to disaster relief. They will also get preference during the government wheat procurement.
At a provincial cabinet meeting last week, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah had said that the provincial government would start issuing the card within six months. The farmers owning up to 12 acres of land which are cultivated by the owners themselves will be eligible for the card. The government is going to start the survey and registration work for the purpose this month. The information about demographics, contact details, crops, landholding patterns, livestock, irrigation system and mechanisation will be collected.
Khaskheli although appreciated the initiative to the extent that it will be advantageous for the small farmers, he opposed omission of the peasants. According to him, during its previous tenure in the Sindh government the PPP had promised to introduce 'Hari Cards' which were supposed to be given to peasants. But that idea seems to have been shelved.
He looked askance at the government's capacity and intention to enlist all the small farmers particularly those who are often affected by droughts and disasters. Khaskheli said, the farmers associated with the ruling party's local leaders, are more likely to benefit from the scheme.
""But millions of landless peasants who not only cultivate and harvest crops but also invest on inputs are being disregarded by the government."" He demanded that the government should register peasants as agriculture sector's labour under the Sindh Tenancy Act and that women peasants can also be registered under Sindh Agriculture Women Workers Act, 2019. He said, this exercise should be launched without further ado so that in addition to the small farmers, all other peasants also get financial support and relief from the government.

1,Rights commission calls for probe into Hidayatullah Lohar's murder,HRCP alludes political activism seems plausible reason behind killing of nationalist activist,"The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has called for transparent investigation of the murder of Hidayatullah Lohar, a school teacher who was also associated with a nationalist party, who was killed in Naseerabad town of Qambar district of Larkana on February 16. 
In a statement on Monday the HRCP's Chairman Asad Iqbal Butt asked the provincial government to ensure that the investigation of his murder is carried out without taking any pressure.
He also demanded immediate release of the protesters, including two sons of Lohar, who were arrested during a sit-in protest. Butt said the protesters have the constitutional right to hold peaceful demonstrations.
Referring to the HRCP's fact-finding report, which was also released on Monday, Butt said it revealed that Lohar's murder was most likely a targeted killing linked to his nationalist activism. He recalled that the slain person was twice subjected to enforced disappearance.
According to him, the HRCP's fact-finding team did not come across any valid motive behind the killing which might indicate towards personal enmity. ""...Â  the mission found this [Lohar's activism] to be a credible assumption.""
He stated that the mission also observed with concern initial reluctance of the police to lodge an FIR, nominating specific individuals as the accused. This was despite testimonies from Lohar's family and CCTV footage of the incident. The case, however, was registered two weeks later on the court's order.
The HRCP further demanded that the Sindh government should compensate as well as protect Lohar's family, given their vulnerability as vocal activists against enforced disappearances. The perpetrators of the murder must be brought to justice irrespective of any possible links to the powerful quarters, the chairman said.
