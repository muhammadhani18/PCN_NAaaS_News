0,Ramazan drummers struggle as tradition wanes,"For centuries, the rhythmic beat of drums has awakened people for sehri","Ramazan drummers, who have long been an integral part of the sehri waking rituals in Rawalpindi, are gradually fading into obscurity as more and more people turn to digital alarms for their morning calls.
For centuries, the rhythmic beat of drums at sehri time has awakened the populace from their slumber during the holy month of Ramazan. However, this age-old tradition is now facing a decline as mobile phone alarms take precedence.
The traditional practice of drummers circling neighbourhoods to wake people for sehri not only served as a wake-up call but also provided a source of income and employment for many. On Eid, these drummers would receive “Eidi” or festive cash from each household they woke up throughout the month.
In addition to cash, families would also give them essential items like sugar, flour, and rice, reflecting a time of communal support and generosity.
In the past, the absence of loudspeakers in mosques and poor timekeeping made it challenging for people in the Indian subcontinent to wake up for sehri during Ramadan. The drummers’ rhythmic beats and chants served as a vital reminder for families to prepare their pre-dawn meal.
However, with the advent of the new century and technological advancements, this traditional system has seen a gradual decline. Mosques now use loudspeakers to announce the sehri call, rendering the drummers' role less necessary. Additionally, the rise of social media platforms and mobile alarms has further diminished the demand for drummers.
While this traditional practice persisted until the 1990s, it began to wane as scientific progress altered the landscape of waking rituals. The younger generation, accustomed to digital alarms notifications, has largely abandoned the old drumming tradition.
Another short-lived method involved reciting naats in the streets to wake people for sehri, but this too gave way to modern communication technologies. Today, platforms like TikTok, Facebook, and WhatsApp serve as the primary means of staying awake until dawn for Sehri.
In this era of rapid technological advancement, old customs like drumming and reciting naats are gradually disappearing. Families now stay awake until dawn with the help of social media, marking a significant shift in Ramadan waking rituals. As science progresses, traditional practices give way to modern conveniences, reshaping the cultural fabric of communities like Rawalpindi.

1,PTI denied permission to hold rally in Islamabad,Islamabad DC rejects PTI’s application for public gathering citing security reasons,"The Islamabad Deputy Commissioner (DC) has denied Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) permission to gather a rally on March 30.
The application for the rally was given by PTI Regional President Amir Masood Mughal. The Islamabad High Court had ordered the DC Islamabad to take a decision on the application submitted in two days.
The Islamabad DC rejected the application citing the law and order situation. He said that the public gathering cannot be allowed in light of reports from the law enforcement agencies about the recent activities of the outlawed group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
He also added that the PTI had also previously violated the rules by giving an affidavit when the party had been allowed to hold meetings and rallies.
Along with this, the response to the application also stated that the return of foreign troops which participated in the Pakistan Day parade on March 23 will continue in the coming weeks. Additionally, the federal police are presently engaged in special security and sehri and iftar duties of Ramazan. A heavy contingent of the federal police will also be required on Al-Quds Day.
The DC has sent a report detailing his reasoning for denying PTI to the Federal Secretary, Home and Chief Commissioner.

2,‘Lethal kite strings being supplied from K-P’,Says report complied by special branch; district admin to take up issue with K-P govt,"The Rawalpindi district administration has found out that the supply of lethal kite strings, responsible for numerous fatalities, originates from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), therefore, the administration has decided to take up this issue with the K-P government.
A senior district administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, shared that following the tragic death of a young man in Faisalabad due to a killer string, the Rawalpindi administration launched an inquiry. According to the report compiled by the special branch, 90% of the killer strings and kites circulating in the twin cities are supplied from K-P.
The report stated that traders engaged in the sale of these lethal strings and kites get them in Haripur, Abbottabad, Nowshera, and Peshawar. While Punjab has imposed a comprehensive ban on kite flying and the sale of killer strings, KP harbours factories manufacturing kites and related paraphernalia.
Further investigation found no local manufacturing facilities for strings and kites in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Instead, individuals resort to contacting dealers in K-P to get these items. The report highlighted that K-P-based kite and string dealers even offer home delivery services, utilising various courier companies and road transportation for distribution.
Keeping these facts into account, the district administration has decided to engage with the K-P government and administration to halt the supply of kites and strings to Rawalpindi. Initial steps involve identifying the extent of the problem through formal correspondence. Additionally, law enforcement agencies will collaborate to arrest all dealers involved in this illicit trade, which poses a grave threat to public safety.
Furthermore, the Rawalpindi and Attock Police have been directed to swiftly identify and apprehend people involved in this illicit trade. These proactive measures aim to dismantle the demand and supply network of killer kites and strings, which have claimed so many lives despite the government’s ban on kite flying.
Despite the government’s ban, two separate Basant festivals were celebrated in Rawalpindi this year, leading to fatalities and injuries caused by strings. Law enforcement agencies have arrested so many individuals yet the illegal practice persists.

3,Call for suspension of new varsities,"VCs committee stresses the need to consolidate existing resources, enhance efficiency","Vice Chancellors Committee while recognising the detrimental impact of proliferation in the number of institutions on the quality of education, advocated for an immediate halt to the establishment of new universities. They also underscored the importance of consolidating existing institutions to enhance efficiency and optimise resource allocation.
In a concerted effort to address the pressing challenges faced by the higher education sector, the Vice Chancellors’ Committee was convened for a two-day meeting in Islamabad with the participation of more than 160 public and private universities from across the country.
The gathering provided a platform for the university heads to engage in comprehensive discussions and formulate strategic initiatives to navigate the turbulent landscape of the country’s tertiary education.
The meeting was presided over by the Chairperson of the VCs’ Committee Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan and was also attended by the Chairman Higher Education Commission (HEC) Dr Mukhtar Ahmad, Executive Director of HEC Dr Ziaul Qayyum and divisional heads of HEC.
The vice-chancellors of public sector universities unanimously voiced their concern over the financial challenges being faced by the universities.
Emphasising the pivotal role of financial resources in sustaining academic excellence, they called for immediate corrective actions by the government as well as by the management of the universities.
Furthermore, to streamline resource utilization, they stressed the need to curtail new development projects and redirect focus towards completing the ongoing projects particularly those in advanced stages of their completion.
While appreciating the Sindh government for a considerable increase in the budgetary allocation for higher education, the participants emphasised the significance of sustained financial support from provincial governments and urged other provinces to follow suit.
With a firm commitment to fiscal prudence, the vice-chancellors resolved to implement stringent measures aimed at cutting unnecessary expenditure within universities. The proposal to appoint financial experts as Treasurers in universities, instead of officers from the general cadre or faculty members, was also agreed upon.
The meeting also highlighted the importance of embracing e-governance solutions to streamline administrative processes, enhance transparency, and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
Acknowledging the need for diversification in revenue streams, the university heads underscored the importance of exploring novel approaches for resource generation.
They emphasised the potential of public-private partnerships, alumni engagement, and other possible initiatives to augment financial sustainability. There was also a consensus on the transformative impact of endowment funds in fostering academic excellence.
The participants agreed that the selection process for vice chancellors as well as faculty appointment criteria need to be thoroughly reviewed and that it should be aligned with the international best practices.
Similarly, there was a consensus on transition towards non-pensionable recruitments in the universities, aimed at mitigating long-term financial liabilities.
Considering the challenges being faced by HEC and the universities due to the functioning of two parallel systems of Tenure Track Statutes (TTS) and Basic Pay Scale (BPS) for faculty appointments, the meeting recommended that there is a dire need to develop a standardised performance-based faculty appointment service structure.
Under this proposed system, the appointments should be made exclusively through open competition and the performance of the faculty should be evaluated every year for monetary incentives.
The participants also acknowledged the fact that the research quality at MS and PhD levels requires special attention. They expressed concern over instances of unethical practices that compromise the validity and credibility of research.
They emphasised the importance of robust institutional frameworks for research ethics oversight, stringent anti-plagiarism measures, and programmes to raise awareness about the importance of academic honesty and adherence to ethical standards.

4,No leniency for sharing objectionable pictures: IHC,Rejects post-arrest bail plea of accused who posted girl’s objectionable photos online,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has observed that the suspects who share objectionable pictures of women with others and similar offences do not deserve any leniency.
The remarks were made by IHC’s Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri during the hearing of a plea seeking bail for a man, Muhammad Haseeb, who is accused of sharing objectionable pictures of a girl on social media site Facebook and her father and husband on WhatsApp. The court rejected the post-arrest bail plea of the accused.
While rejecting Haseeb’s bail plea, Justice Jahangiri issued a six-page written verdict in the case. The court said that according to the technical analysis expert report, the accused committed a serious offence. In the court verdict, it has been said that according to the records, the accused sent the pictures to the girl’s father, husband and friends and also uploaded them on Facebook.
“This crime has become very common in society. When boys and girls are in a relationship, girls send their objectionable photos to boys,” the court observed.
The IHC’s decision further said: “When the boy and the girl break up, boys upload objectionable pictures on Facebook or share them with friends and family members of the girl. These images cause lifelong shame for the girls and destroy their family life. In most cases, girls also committed suicide.”
The court remarked that the accused involved in such crimes did not deserve any leniency.
The case against Haseeb was registered at the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) Cybercrime Reporting Centre, Islamabad, under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, alleging that the accused “disgraced and destroyed the modesty” of the complainant by capturing or recording her objectionable pictures with authorisation and publicly projected them and shared with her family members.

5,Importance of water management stressed,Experts say millions still lack access to clean drinking water and sanitation,"The International Day of Water was celebrated worldwide, with Pakistan actively participating in the global observance. This year’s theme, “Leveraging Water for Peace,” underscored the critical role water plays in our ecosystems, economies, and lives.
Despite progress, millions globally still lack access to clean drinking water and sanitation, emphasising the urgent need for collective action, reported PTV news channel. A symbolic ceremony was held at the Indus River, attended by government officials, environmentalists, and community leaders. Participants came together to honour Pakistan’s rich water heritage, vowing to protect this invaluable resource for future generations.
March 22 marks International Water Day, uniting communities, organisations, and governments in advocating for water conservation and equitable access to clean water resources. This global platform raises awareness about freshwater’s significance and advocates for sustainable water management.
Pakistan echoed this call for action, reaffirming its commitment to addressing water challenges and promoting sustainability. Innovative technologies and practices, such as desalination plants and water-efficient agricultural techniques, are being embraced to combat water scarcity and pollution.
Mohammad Nawaz, an expert in water reserve management, stressed the urgency of safeguarding water resources. He highlighted the unsustainable use of underground water sources and the need to capture rainwater through small dams and ponds for domestic use and conservation.
He emphasised the importance of monitoring and balancing water systems to address challenges posed by climate change. Nawaz emphasised the importance of constructing small dams and ponds to capture rainwater, ensuring its utilisation for domestic purposes and conservation of underground water reserves which are decreasing day by day.
Dr Shakeel, a specialist in Climate Change and Water Governance, emphasized the importance of creating awareness and changing behaviours to conserve sweet water for drinking and utilise rainwater for other purposes. Despite progress, challenges persist, especially in regions facing water stress and conflict. Pollution, over-extraction, and unequal distribution exacerbate water insecurity, highlighting the need for collective action to safeguard this precious resource.
On International Water Day, let us recommit ourselves to water conservation and equitable access, recognising water as a fundamental human right. Through collaboration and solidarity, we can ensure a sustainable and water-secure future for generations to come.
As Pakistan and the world celebrate International Water Day, the message is clear: collective efforts are crucial to ensure water security, promote peace, and foster sustainable development for present and future generations.

6,Hindus celebrate festival of colours in Rawalpindi,Rawalpindi police provide ‘foolproof’ security to gathering places,"The festival of colours, Holi, was celebrated with traditional zeal and fervour by the Hindu community in Rawalpindi.
Colourful events were organised under tight security at the Gracy Line Main Temple, the 100-year-old Krishna Temple and the ancient temple of Lal Kurti.
Members of the community invoked prayers and threw colours on each other, adding to the vibrance of the celebrations. The participants sang religious songs and interacted with each other as part of the festival to strengthen communal bonding. Temples were also decorated with great beauty for Holi. Colorful flags, and electric lamps were installed in the temples.
The Hindu community of Rawalpindi and Islamabad participated in Holi celebrations with their families. Hindu women and children came to the temples with great obeisance.
These celebrations started after sunset and continued until late at night. At the end the Parshad was also distributed, while the President of Pakistan Hindu Sikh Social Welfare Council Sardar Hira Lal said Holi is our religious festival, the government has provided full support and security for it, while the local Muslim brothers have also provided full support and facilities for which we are grateful.
“Minority communities want the development of Pakistan. We are Pakistanis first and the white colour in Pakistan’s flag is the protector of the minorities. In the end, prayers were also sought for Pakistan's development, prosperity and security.

7,Holy Family’s revamp delayed again,"Prolonged closure irks patients, strains Pindi’s other healthcare facilities","The renovation and revamping project at Holy Family Hospital (HFH), one of Rawalpindi's largest public hospitals, will not meet its second deadline of March 31, despite towering claims by authorities concerned.
The Rs3 billion worth initiative was launched during the caretaker government’s tenure. The hospital has been closed since October 25, 2023, with the administration rejecting the Communication and Works (C&W) Department's proposal to hand over only the emergency and outpatient department (OPD) by the end of March due to the operational necessity of wards.
HFH, boasting 1,052 beds, shut its doors in October for extensive overhaul and modernisation. Medical Superintendent Dr Ijaz Butt confirmed the completion of a small part of the project. However, the full scope of work, including the new block, is yet to be finished as per the health secretary's revised deadline.
With HFH closed, patients have been redirected to Benazir Bhutto General Hospital (BBGH), District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ), and Rawalpindi Institute of Urology and Transplantation (RIUT), already strained healthcare facilities. Queues of patients have assembled in the OPD and emergency department, while patients approaching the surgery and orthopaedic departments are being given appointments of three to four months from now.
The closure particularly affects women, given HFH's prominent Gynecology department, adding strain to other hospitals with limited capacity.
While some HFH departments found temporary homes at BBGH, DHQ, RIUT, and Red Crescent Hospital, the redistribution hasn't alleviated the strain, especially for patients in need of specialised care. The dengue ward and related services were shifted to Red Crescent Hospital due to its capacity, but other departments remain dispersed among overburdened facilities.
The prolonged closure of HFH has exacerbated challenges for impoverished and middle-class patients, lacking viable alternatives. The delay in reopening adds pressure to an already strained healthcare system, highlighting the urgent need to complete the renovation promptly and ensure seamless healthcare access for the local community.
Residents continue to face hardships as uncertainty looms over HFH's reopening schedule, emphasising the critical role this institution plays in meeting healthcare needs in Rawalpindi. Efforts to expedite the remaining work and prioritise patient care are essential to mitigate the current healthcare crisis caused by HFH's closure.
Shortage of medicines has also been reported in other public hospitals. Even patients admitted to the hospital are suffering from a lack of essential medicines’ availability. They are forced to buy medicines by visiting external pharmacies.

8,Cop faces drug smuggling charges,NH&MP constitutes high-level committee to probe allegations,"A National Highways and Motorways Police officer has been arrested following allegations of drug smuggling in Hasan Abdal.
According to sources, a case has been registered against the policeman to initiate departmental proceedings. They said the motorways police had initiated an investigation after suspicions arose regarding the officer's involvement in illicit activities, specifically the unauthorised removal and distribution of seized drugs among police personnel. A high-level committee has been established to verify these claims, and the inquiry remains ongoing.
The incident unfolded during a crackdown on drug smuggling conducted by the motorway police, the sources revealed. Officer Farhad Khan stands accused of pilfering portions of seized drugs from official caches. ASI Nasir Mehmood, recounting the events leading to the case, stated that he encountered Farhad Khan during a routine stop duty near the railway gate. Subsequently, a search yielded twelve kilograms of hashish and a firearm in the suspect's possession, prompting the registration of a case.
During interrogation, Farhad Khan disclosed his affiliation with the motorway police and admitted to stealing the hashish from the seized consignment, implicating other officers in similar illicit activities. These revelations prompted action from Hasan Abdal police, who took up the matter with higher authorities, including DPO Attock Sardar Ghiyas Gul. The situation was communicated to motorway police authorities for immediate inquiry and action.
National Highways and Motorway Police Additional IG Ashfaq Ahmed emphasised the department's commitment to maintaining integrity by swiftly addressing misconduct. A high-level committee has been tasked with investigating Constable Farhad's case comprehensively and generating a detailed report, he said. “Any officer or official found complicit in such activities will face severe consequences, ensuring accountability within the motorway police ranks”.
