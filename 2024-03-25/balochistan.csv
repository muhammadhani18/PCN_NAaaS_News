0,Security gaps endangering devotees’ safety,Visitors at the Data Darbar feel insecure within the premises of Lahore’s largest shrine,"Inadequate security measures at Lahore's revered shrines pose grave risks to devotees and visitors, as revealed by recent investigations. Guards, often lacking proper training and hired on daily wages or through private security firms, fail to conduct thorough physical searches of visitors and their belongings. 
Moreover, malfunctioning walk-through gates and deficient manual scanners further exacerbate security vulnerabilities, fostering an environment ripe for pickpocketing, extortion, and even kidnappings within the shrine precincts.
Lahore Division hosts 57 shrines, including 4 major Darbars: Data Darbar, Bibi Pak Daman Darbar, Mian Mir Darbar, and Madhu Lal Darbar. Among these, Data Darbar stands out, attracting over 50,000 devotees daily and witnessing a staggering 1.5 million devotees during its annual Urs celebrations. Tragically, Data Darbar has been targeted by terrorism twice, with devastating attacks claiming numerous lives in 2010 and 2019.
Presently, security at Data Darbar and other shrines relies on a mix of guards—daily wage watchmen, security personnel contracted from private firms, and a limited police presence. However, the efficacy of these measures remains questionable. Walk-through gates frequently malfunction, while handheld scanners often lack functioning batteries, rendering them ineffective in detecting potential threats.
Data Darbar, in particular, has become a hotspot for criminal activity, with pickpockets preying on unsuspecting devotees, many of whom hail from distant regions and lack awareness of the dangers lurking within the shrine's premises. Muhammad Dastgir, a pilgrim from Okara, who visits Data Darbar regularly, lamented, ""criminals and terrorists can easily enter by taking advantage of the cursory search conducted by the police and private guards stationed here.""
Instances of fraud and exploitation, often facilitated by intoxicants, further compound the security challenges faced by visitors. Ruqqaiya Younis expressed her concerns, stating, ""suspicious men and women keep roaming around the women's section, making us feel insecure.""
Disturbingly, reports of women and children being abducted from Data Darbar underscore the urgent need for enhanced security protocols. Certain gangs, as highlighted by police sources, target vulnerable individuals, particularly women and children, through langar distribution centres within or near the shrine. These perpetrators exploit the naivety of their victims, many of whom are runaways or strangers to Lahore, luring them into dangerous situations with false promises.
In response to these concerns, Secretary Auqaf and Religious Affairs Department, Punjab, Tahir Bukhari, outlined ongoing security measures, including the deployment of trained watchmen and contracted security guards, supplemented by round-the-clock police presence and extensive CCTV coverage. “Presently, 36 watchmen are working on daily wages at Data Darbar on behalf of the department. 
Moreover, services of 78 guards have also been procured from a security company. Additionally, a police force headed by the DSP Security Data Darbar is present at each gate 24 hours a day. Apart from this, monitoring is done through 130 CCTV cameras,” explained Bukhari while talking to the Express Tribune.

1,Over 100 beggars booked in Lahore,CTO highlights traffic hazards caused by begging on roads,"The traffic police have booked 102 professional beggars in an operation across the city.
Lahore Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Amara Athar said in a statement that the number of professional peddlers had increased in Ramazan and four squads had been formed for the crackdown against them. 
She said 102 cases had been registered against professional beggars during the month.
The CTO said more than 830 children and elderly beggars had been released after giving a warning. 
Amara Athar ordered the divisional and circle officers to take strict action against beggars.
She said the beggars were being removed from main traffic signals, while cases had been registered against those duping the citizens by posing as being disabled.
“The citizens should support the traffic police in discouraging such elements because your hard earned money is not for cheaters,” she appealed.
The CTO said that not only the traffic flow was affected by the beggars, but there was also a risk of road accidents. 
She added that the operation would help maintain the flow of traffic.
She said being poor was not a crime, but making begging on the false pretext of being needy was a moral crime. Cases should be registered against those who disguised themselves for begging, she added.

2,Mari Indus Railway Station faces ruin,Building falling apart due to lack of maintenance for decades,"A railway station built in 1891 at Mari Indus, the second major junction on the track after Kundian, is on the brink of ruin. 
Bushes and trees have grown rampantly around the railway lines and historic buildings are falling apart due to lack of maintenance. 
Speaking to The Express Tribune, a local resident, Ejaz Khan Jazi, said his ancestors had served at the station. 
The railway station building has a strong structure like other buildings constructed during the British rule. There was also a workshop, a power house and a guest house. 
However, the station appears like a haunted place because of lack of maintenance for the past six decades.
Jazi said the building was a cultural heritage site of the area and the railway department could release funds for keeping it functional after repair. 
The land of the Mari Indus Railway Station is very valuable. It lies between the bank of the Indus river and the Kalabagh Road. 
If the department had brought the land to commercial use, it could have earned millions of rupees per month and the money could have been spent on maintenance. However, no attention has been paid to this aspect. 
Trains still depart for Lahore and Attock from the station and an office is also located on the dilapidated premises. 
Hundreds of employees work under the supervision of the railway officials deputed in the area.
Another resident, Akram Niazi, claimed that nuts and bolts had been stolen from the railway line, putting at risk the safety of passengers.

4,"Garbage piles, drains threaten ‘Clean Punjab’",Residents question official reports about campaign,"The picturesque town of Buchiana is grappling with a growing crisis as piles of garbage and boiling drains threaten to mar the Clean Punjab programme championed by the chief minister.
Allegations of false reporting by the Union Council secretary and neglect from staff concerned have further exacerbated the situation, with claims of substantial funds being misappropriated.
Reports from urban and rural communities paint a grim picture of the area resembling a filth depot, with garbage heaps and sewage-filled drains turning markets into cesspools.
The overwhelming stench emanating from the accumulated waste has made daily life unbearable for residents and passers-by alike.
Despite promises made during previous caretaker governments and initiatives like the Village Brightening Programme, little progress has been made on the ground in Buchiana.
The lack of coordination between relevant organisations and committees formed by Union Councils has further hindered efforts to address the sanitation crisis.
With the implementation of the Clean Punjab programme yet to commence, the threat of disease outbreaks looms large over the town, exacerbated by the structural damage caused by blocked drains and overflowing garbage heaps.
Desperate residents are calling on higher authorities to intervene urgently, urging for immediate action to clean the drains and remove the piles of waste in Buchiana to safeguard public health and prevent the spread of deadly diseases.
In this regard, President of the Traders Association Malik Muhammad Ashraf stated that the incomplete arrangements for cleanliness and the heaps of garbage have made life miserable in Buchiana.
Mobile Phone Association President of Buchiana Syed Muqaddas Hussain Zaidi said the piles of garbage and waste cricket on the streets and roads are no less than a nightmare.
“Despite repeated requests to the Union Council Secretary, no action has been taken to remove the garbage heaps and clean the drains,” he said.
Social Youth Organisation President Malik Waqas Mujtaba remarked that the heaps of garbage in urban and rural areas of Buchiana are contradicting the vision of clean and stable Punjab announced by the Chief Minister of Punjab.
“The reports provided by the officials of the concerned department are misleading the public and officials alike.”
Members of the “Abb Gaon Chakein Gay” Syed Zahid Hussain and Abid Hussain Malik stated that neither have we been questioned about cleanliness nor has any action plan been prepared after a meeting for cleanliness.
They mentioned that the Union Council Secretary, 41, has repeatedly come to us to collect the garbage tax imposed by the government, but no work has been done regarding cleanliness.
The locals have appealed to the authorities to immediately remove the garbage heaps in Buchiana and clean the drains to protect the citizens from various diseases.
When contacted about the incomplete arrangements for cleanliness in Buchiana, the officers concerned stated that they will eliminate the heaps of garbage cricket in Buchiana city.

6,‘Modern tools to transform farming’,Experts suggest use of crop monitoring drones to empower farmers,"Dr Alamgir Khan from Muhammad Nawaz Sharif University of Agriculture has said that modern technologies like precision irrigation systems and crop monitoring drones empower farmers with real-time data, enhancing decision-making and resource allocation.
Highlighting the crucial role of soil analysis tools in maximising yields, he said agriculture remains the backbone of Pakistan's economy, sustaining millions of livelihoods. “Yet, many farmers lack access to modern tools vital for optimal crop yields.”
Dr Khan underscores challenges like low organic matter in Pakistani soil and soil compaction due to heavy machinery movement. He advocated for modern ploughing tools and composting innovations to address these issues.
Additionally, he emphasised the importance of soil moisture retention and efficient fertiliser use.
Secretary Agriculture South Punjab Saqib Ateel acknowledged the importance of modern tools but stresses the need for precision to avoid losses. He recommends prioritizing investment in efficient machinery for sustainable agriculture.
Shahid Hameed Bhutta, a prominent mango grower, highlights the necessity of machinery for smart agriculture practices.
He emphasised the lack of access to machinery among small farmers and calls for government support.
Agriculture department officials Abdul Samad and Rashid Sidhu mentioned the Punjab government subsidies on 56 agri-tools to assist farmers.
Efficient machinery, from soil preparation to post-harvest management, is crucial for sustainable agriculture. Saqib Ateel suggests investing in transformative technologies, while Bhutta stresses the need for government support for small farmers.

7,All set for anti-polio campaign,Kids to be vaccinated in seven Punjab districts,"A special polio eradication campaign response phase will commence on Monday in seven districts of Punjab.
Punjab Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) Coordinator Khizer Afzaal said on Sunday that the campaign would cover the Faisalabad, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, Faisalabad, Kasur and Okara districts.
It will continue for a week in Faisalabad and five days in the other districts.
Over 30,000 polio workers and supervisors will participate in the drive to immunise 4.5 million children under the age of five.
The EOC coordinator directed the district teams to make the campaign successful, saying the special effort would be helpful in blocking poliovirus recirculation in Punjab.
“Amid poliovirus circulation in other provinces, Punjab has not reported any polio case since October 2020, which is an achievement of the programme. But movement of population from core reservoirs to Punjab was one of the major causes of virus importation in Punjab,” cautioned the coordinator.
He said the programme’s health workers on the forefront continued to reach children in some of the hardest to reach areas with the singular goal to reach every child with the polio vaccine and ensure a polio-free world for future generations.
He also cautioned the workers against complacency, stressing that the country could not afford to let poliovirus return to the province.
Afzaal underscored that the Punjab government, through the health department, was ensuring the safety and security of the frontline workers.
The EOC coordinator reiterated that multiple doses of polio drops offered the best protection against the virus, highlighting the need to vaccinate every child to achieve population immunity and prevent virus circulation.
“Parents must welcome polio teams whenever they come to knock at their doors. Local communities must be reassured that immunisation is a safe and effective means of safeguarding their children against this virus. With dedication and hard work, Punjab aims to remain polio-free in 2024,” the EOC head reiterated.
