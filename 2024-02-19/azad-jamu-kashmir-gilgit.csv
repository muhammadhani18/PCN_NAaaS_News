2,"‘Murghi Paal’, ‘Katta Farba’ schemes back in focus",These initiatives aim to boost poultry farming and halal meat production,"The Rawalpindi Poultry Research Institute and the Livestock and Punjab Dairy Development Department have sent a summary to the provincial government to revive ""Katta Farba"" and “Murghi Paal” schemes after two years.
The initiative was taken by the PTI government under the ""Murghi Paal"" and “Halal Meat” projects, but later the Punjab government decided to cut 50 per cent of funding of the Murghi Paal scheme owing to financial constraints in December 2022.
Authorities have also requested the provincial government to restore funds for the two programmes already termed as public-friendly projects.
During the PTI regime, the registered applicants received a batch of five hens and a rooster at a discounted price of Rs1,050 under the Murghi Pal programme, while those who were registered for the Katta Farba programme received Rs4,000 for upbringing and feeding calves. After being grown up, the meat of calves was supplied to supplied to domestic and foreign countries.
Under the two programmes, around 500,000 poultry birds were distributed among citizens and farmers across Punjab till April 2022. The discounted price of the chicken set was set at Rs1,050 at the start of the project, but after a year it jumped by Rs80 to Rs1,130, and Rs1,200 after six months.  In Rawalpindi district, 2,790 sets of chickens were distributed.
Sources in the Poultry Research Institute claim that even after the programme was discontinued, they still had a demand of 1.5 million birds across the province. Large quantities of chicken sets were acquired in urban areas of the province.
The Katta Farba programme aimed to stop the genocide of calves and to raise them instead of slaughtering them for meat so that they can be raised for higher prices. Rewards were also being given to those who grew calves under the Katta Farba scheme.
Sources in the Rawalpindi Livestock and Dairy Development Department said that the production of halal meat in the country could be increased with the ""Katta Farba Katta Bachao"" project.
Assistant Director Dr Atif said that the institute had raised those chickens with the mix breeding of Aseel and indigenous chicks and that they could lay up to 230 eggs annually.

4,PHC tightens grip on health sector,Directs healthcare facilities to adopt WHO-backed mandatory health indicators,"In a significant move, the Punjab Healthcare Commission (PHC) has issued a plethora of notices to all private healthcare centres, hospitals and laboratories across Rawalpindi City and Cantonment, directing them to adopt the mandatory health indicators developed under the guidelines issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
According to sources, failure to comply with the directives laid down in the notices, which emphasise the need for adherence to quality standards, will result in a ban on operations for the non-compliant entities.
They said patients availing services from private healthcare providers or undergoing tests at laboratories reserve the right to lodge formal complaints with the PHC if dissatisfied with the service quality.
Upon successful registration, the second phase entails the issuance of formal licenses to healthcare facilities meeting the specified health indicators. All private healthcare establishments under the jurisdiction of the PHC must ensure the delivery of quality services and adhere to approved pricing schedules. Similarly, private pathology laboratories are obligated to conduct standardised tests.
Earlier, the commission granted licenses to three government hospitals in Rawalpindi, namely Benazir Bhutto General Hospital, Holy Family Hospital, and District Headquarters Hospital, after fulfilling treatment-related health indicators. Notably, these hospitals incurred fines of Rs120,000 per establishment for non-compliance dating back to 2012.
In a bid to uphold public health standards, the Healthcare Commission has initiated crackdowns targeting counterfeit medical practitioners and unregistered healthcare facilities. Treatment provisions under Sehat Sahulat Cards have been revoked for unlicensed public or private hospitals. 
The PHC’s health indicators, introduced in 2012, encompass various aspects of healthcare delivery, ensuring patient-centric services in government hospitals.
Furthermore, the PHC is actively combating the proliferation of vendors promoting false cures for diseases on streets and sidewalks. Citizens can report complaints against unlicensed practitioners through the prime minister and Punjab chief minister portal. Notably, substantial fines have been imposed on numerous private hospitals and laboratories for failure to register with the PHC.
In cases of patient harm due to medical negligence, the PHC ensures judicial proceedings against responsible medical personnel, including imprisonment and fines. Similar punitive measures are enforced against private laboratories operating without registration.
Before registration, the PHC conducts thorough inspections of public and non-government hospitals, medical centres, laboratories, and traditional medicine practitioners. Facilities failing to meet the designated health indicators are subject to significant penalties. However, upon rectifying deficiencies and fulfilling all requirements, healthcare facilities receive licensure from the PHC.
