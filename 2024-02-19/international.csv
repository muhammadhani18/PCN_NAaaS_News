0,University of Peshawar faces dropping admission rates,"Substandard academics, turbulent faculty have reduced the credibility of the institution among bachelor’s students","For any country to embark on the road to socioeconomic progress, the higher education system must educate and train a sizeable population of students in a wide variety of subjects yet as admission rates for the bachelor’s program at the University of Peshawar continue to observe a downward trend, any hopes for a way out of the current state of domestic instability, seems to be fading away.
Founded way back in 1950, the University of Peshawar (UoP) once held the reputation of being the parent of higher education institutions in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) however, in recent times, a lack of administrative and academic efficiency alongside a deteriorating standard of education has led to a sharp decline in the admission rates across all departments, out of which ten, including the departments of Philosophy, Gender Studies, History, Pashto and Social Work, have no students at all.
According to documents obtained by The Express Tribune, UoP has witnessed an unprecedented decline in admission to its Bachelor of Science (BS) programme, which has received only 3000 students across 53 different faculties this year, that is half of its earlier rate of enrolment, as a result of which the institution is facing a loss of Rs118 million.
Shah Nawaz Khan, an educationist was of the opinion that the UoP has been battling with a serious dearth of financial resources since the past five years due to its poor management.

“A perception has been created among parents and students that not only is the UOP degree expensive but pursuing it is also a waste of time since the teachers and other staff members were always on protest. The standard of education too is deteriorating day by day and students have very little facilities available on campus. Furthermore, since the past one year, the university is functioning without a permanent Vice Chancellor for supervising its affairs,” regretted Khan
On the other hand, Dr Muhammad Uzair, President of the Peshawar University Teachers Association opined that apart from poor administration, the dropping rates of admission at UoP could also be attributed to the sprawling of cheaper colleges, which were offering BS degrees at a much lesser fee.
“If students can earn a degree for only Rs12,000, why would they choose a university which costs at least Rs70,000,” said Dr Uzair.
Speaking to the Express Tribune on the matter, Dr Muhammad Saleem, Pro-Vice Chancellor at the University of Peshawar claimed that multiple factors could explain the declining rate of admission at UoP.
“Since some time, the government has stopped releasing funds for the education sector due to which the university had to increase its fee, which led to lower admission rates. The UoP will review its admission fee policy to attract more students in the coming years,” he assured.

1,US hunter bags Markhor trophy,The number of markhors in Chitral was steadily declining,"During the third trophy hunt of the season, American national Robert Myles Hall successfully hunted a Kashmir Markhor at the Gehrait-Golain Community Managed Game Reserve in Chitral district, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, on Sunday. The Markhor, estimated to be around eight years old, boasted horns measuring 38 inches.
It may be recalled that on February 2, in the second hunt of the season, Denis Morozov, a Russian national, hunted down a Kashmir Markhor at Tooshi-Shasha Community Managed Game Reserve within the jurisdiction of Kasit VIllage.
The horn size of this mountain monarch was recorded 49 inches. It is mention-worthy that Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Wildlife Department is pursuing proactive conservation of wildlife species with the support of local communities as co-management partners.

In December last year, an American hunted a nine-year-old Kashmiri Markhor in Toshi Shasha Game Reserve in Lower Chitral. The US citizen, Deron James Millman, secured the bid for this hunt from the wildlife department after paying a hefty amount of Rs65 million or $232,000.
This is reportedly the highest bid paid for trophy hunting in Lower Chitral. According to the wildlife department, the markhor’s horn measured 45 inches, with the highest recorded in the conservative areas of Chitral at 53 inches.
A wildlife department official explained that 70% of the funds acquired from the trophy hunting permit would be retained locally, while the remaining 30% would be directed to the government’s treasury.
Initially, the number of markhors in Chitral was steadily declining but since the establishment of conservancies and game reserves with the local community’s participation, they have been increasing.
The breeding of markhors has now increased significantly and now they number in the thousands.

2,Chitral and Swat blanketed in snow,Hill stations receive snowfall after a month’s interval,"After an almost month-long hiatus, Chitral Upper and Lower districts in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) experienced snowfall, underscoring the region’s shifting weather patterns attributed to climate change. Similarly, Kalam in Swat, Shangla, and other mountainous districts, including Hazara Division, witnessed heavy snowfall.
According to forecasts from the Met Office and Provincial Disaster Management Authority, the snowfall is projected to persist until the 21st of this month. Areas such as Torkahu, Kahot, Kabor, Lowari Top, Madak, Kashat, Kalash valley, and the picturesque Laspur valley have been blanketed in pristine white snow. Conversely, lower-lying regions like Chitral proper and Darosh experienced nominal rainfall.
Local residents highlighted Chitral’s heavy reliance on rain for irrigation, noting a significant decrease in precipitation this year. Consequently, their wheat crops suffered from insufficient water. They also remarked on the heightened chill in the air following the onset of snow in the highlands.
Meanwhile, the district administration in Dir Upper deployed policemen to enforce the use of snow chains for vehicles traversing the Lowari Tunnel. The prices of timber surged significantly as it became the primary source of firewood due to the absence of Sui gas.
PDMA issued fresh alerts to all mountainous districts as another spell of snowfall was forecasted from the 18th of this month. A new weather system approaching the hilly districts is anticipated to bring heavy snowfall, rainfall, and high winds, according to a press statement issued on Tuesday.

District authorities have been instructed to implement precautionary measures and ensure the availability of machinery to clear snow-covered roads and mitigate potential landslides. They are also tasked with disseminating weather forecasts to local residents and tourists to facilitate appropriate precautionary measures and adjustments to travel plans. Additionally, they have been urged to arrange alternative routes in anticipation of road closures due to heavy snow or landslides.
Last year PDMA, under the guidance of the relief, rehabilitation and settlement department, had formulated the Winter Contingency Plan for 2023-24 in order to cope with various natural hazards in the winter season.
The plan encompassed strategies to manage hazards such as extreme low temperatures, fog, smog, snowfall, rainfall, landslides, flash floods and seismic activities in the mountainous north and west.
In a press statement, PDMA Director General Muhammad Qaisar Khan stated that the Winter Contingency Plan 2023-24 had been initiated in October 2023 and involved key stakeholders such as the federal government, provincial line departments, the district administration, UNDP GLOF-II and other development partners
The statement further said digital tools for data collection had been developed and shared, including information on district, sector-specific hazards, vulnerability profiles, hazard impacts, damages, compensation details, resource mapping, need assessment, and coordination efforts.
The Winter Contingency Plan 2023-24 offers a comprehensive overview of the winter hazard profiles for each district in the province. It includes details on the composite risk score for every district based on various hazards and outlines corresponding risks, along with an estimation of the vulnerable population in cases of emergencies.
The plan further guides districts in mapping vulnerable sites and developing contingency plans, identifying roles.

3,Gandapur unveils plan to reclaim PTI symbol,Says they are trying to join PTI instead of other parties,"Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister-designate, Ali Amin Gandapur, has announced a strategic legal move aimed at ensuring that independently elected candidates supported by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) have the opportunity to join PTI rather than being compelled to align with other political factions. 
Gandapur made this announcement while addressing journalists at the Speaker House in Peshawar. He emphasized the formation of a specialized provincial legal team dedicated to this particular cause, underlining the party’s commitment to upholding democratic principles and ensuring fair representation for PTI supporters.
In a bold statement, Gandapur expressed a willingness to surrender to lawful arrest if it would ultimately benefit the country. He also highlighted the establishment of a provincial complaint cell modeled after the Prime Minister Portal, stressing the importance of unity in safeguarding the rights of the province.
Regarding recent incidents of unrest, Gandapur vehemently denied PTI’s involvement and called for a thorough investigation to identify and hold accountable those responsible for any damages. He provided instances where PTI supporters intending to stage protests were restrained by security forces, demonstrating the party’s commitment to maintaining law and order.
“We need unity and support of all for the rights of the province,” he said, adding that he would go to any lengths to secure the rights of the K-P province from the Centre.

“Silence is not the answer. We would go to any length to take the due rights of the province and we know how to do it,” he observed, adding that he would take all the parties in the province into confidence over the issue.
About May 9 riots, he remarked: “If some supporters of PTI wanted to cause damage they should have been stopped because some of them wanted to march on the residence of Rana Sanaullah and they were stopped by the policemen deployed for security.”
He acknowledged that FIRs have been registered against him in nine districts of the country, including Lahore and Mianwali, but his party PTI now aims to leave the past behind and forge ahead. 
“We are ready to set aside past grievances and implement substantial reforms in government institutions to enhance their performance and meet the public’s expectations,” he declared. 
He emphasized that his party and its leaders are committed to abandoning the politics of revenge. He cited Imran Khan’s affirmation that the army and police are valued allies of PTI, closely aligned with the party’s objectives.
