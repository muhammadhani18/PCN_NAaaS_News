0,Transforming trophy hunting in G-B and Chitral,Moving towards sustainability of wildlife conservation using innovative approaches,"Trophy hunting is the practice of hunting wild animals for sport, not for food. It involves hunters paying high fees to target popular species such as Markhor, Himalayan Ibex, Blue sheep, Ladakh Urial, and many more popular species of ungulates.
The hunting season for Markhor, Ibex, and Blue Sheep typically continues from November 1st till April 31st. December and January are most suitable months for trophy hunting of Markhor and Ibex in the mountains of Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B). However, it is important to note that these species fall in the category of rare and endangered and are therefore regulated by the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Pakistan, as part of CITES and its secretariat, allows trophy hunting quota for bidding every year based on reporting its compliance and undertaking regular inventory of the CITES listed species.
Number of hunting days in the hunting field are specified separately according to the type of permit available. Trophy hunting in G-B and Chitral in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) has become iconic and a great source of earning for the rural communities. This great achievement can be credited to the G-B Forest, Parks and Wildlife department who modified the rigid rules allowing local communities as community watchers that made a difference.
Trophy hunting, initially introduced in Nagar in 1990, has emerged as a highly innovative and fund raising intervention for the local community as 80% of the net sale proceeds go to the community of the hunt area and 20% go to the G-B Forest, Parks and Wildlife department. This has greatly helped in resource mobilisation and ensures ownership of the local communities on these precious resources. Moreover, it has facilitated local development and income generation for community well being and earnings being a sustainable interventions.

This year the G-B Forest, Parks, and Wildlife Department has auctioned four licences for hunting the prized Astore Markhor, each for a record price of $186,000. Permits have been issued to hunt 104 rare species including 4 Markhor, 14 blue sheep, and 86 Himalayan ibex in various community conservation areas across G-B were auctioned as part of the trophy hunting programme for 2023-24. Therefore, the trophy hunting programme has emerged as a circular biodiversity economy playing a major role in sustainable management of a rare species increasing its population and win-win for all stakeholders.
Both foreign and local hunters, along with outfitters, participated in the bidding process at the G-B Forests, Parks and Wildlife Department’s head office. The highest permit for Astore markhor was sold for $186,000, the second for $181,000, the third for $177,000, and the fourth for $171,000. The base rate fees for blue sheep and Himalayan ibex permits were $9,000 and $5,500, respectively. The trophy hunting programme adheres to the “G-B Trophy Hunting Guidelines 2019,” with the hunting season for ungulate species running from November 1, 2023, to April 25, 2024.
Over time trophy hunting has greatly changed the attitudes of local residents towards wildlife, fostering a positive attitude towards the wild ungulates and strongly negative attitude towards wild carnivores. These programmes incentivise local communities to conserve wildlife by providing them with direct financial benefits. This is because the revenue generated from hunting permits is invested back into the local community. Additionally, the programs help control the population of certain species through trophy size animal culling by trophy hunting, ensuring their long-term survival. In addition to providing funds for conservation, hunters play an important role in helping state wildlife biologists manage the size of certain animal populations, according to Nils Peterson, a professor of forestry and environmental resources at the College of Natural Resources. One crucial aspect of this programme is that 80% of the proceeds go to local communities, which utilise the funds for various development projects, including education and healthcare. The remaining 20% of the revenue is deposited into the government’s treasury. There are a total of 47 Community Managed Conservation Areas, which are managed by community organisations involving local communities in the management, conservation and protection of the wildlife. The system is working well in terms of distribution of the net revenue into forestry and community accounts and the latter is used for the welfare and development work in the conservancy.
Thus far, the Trophy Hunting programme has proved to be highly successful. Despite this, the policy and planners must review it and bring innovative changes in the existing programme aiming at sustainability of the Trophy Hunting programme. Researchers, academicians, policymakers and practitioners must join hands and figure out interventions that may pave way forward aiming at sustainability of the programme.
Activities like wildlife watching, winter sports involving the mating of such rare species, wildlife photography, video for TikTok etc, safari rides, water points watching, and such other sports and amusement shall also be introduced alongside trophy hunting. A consultative workshop and regular seminars should also be organised for awareness of the local community and discussing the way forward for sustainable management of the trophy hunting programme in Pakistan.

1,Caretaker’s tax-based performance,"Interim govt inherited political, economic challenges from predecessor","The caretaker setup assumed control of the federal government of Pakistan in mid-August 2023 under the leadership of caretaker Prime Minister Anwarul Haq Kakar. Since then, it has faced criticism for various measures, despite being a technocratic setup. Generally, this kind of setup is good for initiating necessary actions deemed vital by the state, but can also incite public displeasure. The interim government inherited political, economic, and law and order challenges from its predecessor, the Pakistan Democratic Government (PDM). To address economic challenges such as inflation hike, current account deficit, lack of investor interest due to prevailing uncertainty, and mounting debts, it has focused on bringing foreign exchange to Pakistan through promoting the Information Technology Sector and introducing measures for broadening the tax base through digitisation, among others. No doubt, the performance in the tech sector has remained commendable. Whereas taxation measures have been analysed in the upcoming part of this article.
The most important initiative that has remained the talk of the town pertains to the restructuring of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), which the caretaker setup thinks could significantly increase tax revenue and enhance the overall performance of the FBR machinery. The interim government faced backlash from FBR officers too; however, it remained determined and announced the FBR restructuring committee just a week before the general elections, raising questions about the timing of this measure. However, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) refrained from endorsing it, stating that such proposals should be considered by the elected government instead. Measures like these, which could have a significant impact on revenue collection, should never be taken in haste and without thorough consideration.
In this short span of approximately five months, the caretaker setup has also issued multiple Statutory Regulatory Orders [SROs] under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (the Ordinance) read with Income Tax Rules, 2002 (the Rules), and the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (the Act) read with Sales Tax Rules, 2006 (the Rules), to broaden the tax base through digitisation of processes and systems. Credit for this must also be given to the FBR leadership, which has remained very receptive in bringing about changes and ultimately implementing them. The SROs issued under the Ordinance include SRO 1171(I)/2023 dated August 28, 2023, SRO 1588(I)/2023 dated November 21, 2023, SRO 1771(I)/2023 dated December 05, 2023, SRO 1846(I)/2023 dated December 22, 2023, and SRO 1845(I)/2023 dated December 22, 2023, respectively. While the SROs issued under the Act include SRO 1189(I)/2023 dated September 05, 2023, SRO 1185(I)/2023 dated September 05, 2023, SRO 1525(I)/2023 dated November 10, 2023, SRO 1775(I)/2023 dated December 07, 2023, SRO 1788(I)/2023 dated December 11, 2023, SRO 1525-DI(I)/2023 dated December 12, 2023, SRO 1842(I)/2023 dated December 21, 2023, and SRO 28(I)/2024 dated January 10, 2024, respectively.

If the performance of the interim setup is evaluated by focusing on the tax measures taken to promote tax objectives such as documenting the economy, broadening the tax base, and increasing tax revenue, then it can be safely said that it has at least tried to play its role. From bringing rules for record-keeping of beneficial owners to introducing draft SWAPS Rules, which is an initiative to revamp the withholding tax process and further digitise it, the interim setup has been proactive. It has also brought rules for the purpose of section 175A of the Ordinance to provide real-time access to information and databases to the FBR by various specified organisations, which will assist the FBR in multiple ways, including adding those into the tax net who have not yet obtained the registration number and ultimately forcing them to pay their due share of taxes.
If the SROs issued for sales tax are considered, we also find that objectives of taxation are being addressed. For instance, enhancing check posts for the purpose of examining goods and related documents in relation to the supplies of goods originating from tax-exempt areas. The broadening of the scope and applicability of the electronic invoicing system is another landmark achievement of the interim setup, by virtue of which the supply chain of fast-moving consumer goods has been targeted. Further, in another SRO, the scope of Tier-1 retailers has also been enhanced by specifying the threshold for the retailer whose withholding tax is deductible under section 236H of the Ordinance. The perspective also exists in Pakistan that it is not just about issuing SROs, but rather strict implementation should also be done. The upcoming elected government will have a strong responsibility on its shoulders to ensure not only the changes brought about during this period but rather that whatever law is in place is given and implemented in a true sense.
It should always be considered that measures for the improvement of state institutions should not be changed with the shift of power as this impairs their performance. When it comes to investment opportunities, investors are always looking for consistent policies for over a decade or so at least, so that they are comfortable making their decisions with ease, which unfortunately is always missing when we talk about our country Pakistan. Moreover, the interim setup should always consider the constitutional powers it is subject to so that no measures backfire or legal objections are later raised by the honourable courts having competent jurisdiction.

2,Why Pakistan lags in man-made fibre exports,"Country needs to diversify, enhance MMF-based textile exports to address challenges","The global textiles and apparel trade is undergoing a significant transformation, shifting emphatically towards man-made fibres (MMF), which constitute around 63% of global textiles and apparel trade, earning them the title of “fibre of the future”.
However, Pakistan’s textile sector stands at a crucial crossroads, predominantly tethered to cotton-based exports, which account for almost 67% of its total textile and apparel exports.
MMF-based exports account for a mere 12%, thus sidelining itself from the burgeoning MMF market.
This reliance on cotton not only highlights a missed opportunity in an evolving industry but also underscores the necessity for Pakistan to diversify and enhance its textile exports towards MMF to overcome economic challenges and increase its competitiveness in the global textiles landscape.
Despite being among the top 25 textile and apparel exporters, Pakistan has one of the least diversified export baskets.
To gauge the idea, around 1% of the product space accounts for around 65% of exports consisting of denim and non-denim fabrics and apparel, knitwear, socks, home textiles and towels.
Moreover, Pakistan’s textile and apparel exports are highly concentrated in cotton-based products whose share in global trade has shrunk from 40% to 33% between 2007 and 2021 while MMF-based textiles and apparel share has grown from 30% to 35% during the same period.
Since 2007, Bangladesh, India, China and Vietnam have experienced an increase in the share of MMF-based exports, however, Pakistan has not seen an increase in its exports. Also, the share of cotton-based exports has declined for other countries.
For Pakistan, it effectively means that it is competing for a larger piece of a shrinking pie.
There are two main factors behind the lack of growth in MMF-based exports. First, the industry lacks the production capacity necessary to manufacture MMF-based products.
Second, and more importantly, investment in MMF-based manufacturing capacity has been disincentivised by economic distortions, especially in the realm of trade policy.
Polyester staple fibre (PSF) is the basic raw material required for MMF production, and purified terephthalic acid (PTA) is the main input for the manufacturing of PSF.
As it stands, there is 5% import duty on PTA and resultantly a cascading import duty of 7% on PSF with an additional anti-dumping duty of 12% on PSF.
Read: Textile exports surge to $1.46b
The duties on imports were raised from 4% and 6% to 5% and 7% in June 2016. However, Pakistan’s sole PTA manufacturing facility, using an outdated 30-year-old technology, is already outcompeted by newer, more efficient facilities in China and India.
The plant survived on cheap gas ($4/mmBtu) for conversion from paraxylene to PTA and subsidised by high duties on imported PTA/PSF at the expense of the export sector.
Following recent gas pricing reforms, the plant’s operational viability has vanished, leading to the argument that the 5% duty on PTA is unnecessary and should be eliminated along with a reduction in PSF import duty to 2%.
Moreover, in the PSF domain, there are only three major manufacturers that enjoy a protected monopoly due to the imposition of 7% import duties and up to 12% anti-dumping duties on imports of cheaper and higher quality PSF.
Effectively, this has created opportunities for rent-seeking in the PSF market that Pakistani PSF manufacturers have capitalised on by keeping domestic PSF prices significantly above international prices. Higher PSF prices are further enabled by curbs on import LCs faced by the spinning industry.
This rent-seeking behaviour is also triggered by the National Tariff Commission (NTC) of Pakistan.
This has been the case with anti-dumping and import duties on PSF. NTC actions, intended to protect the domestic market and support the broader public interest, have unintentionally favored a small group of domestic manufacturers.
This has come at the expense of a larger group of exporters, highlighting the unintended negative consequences of protectionist trade policies.
Typically, in economics, a non-competitive private entity would be shut down. However, public enterprises are treated differently, often receiving support through expansion, or protectionist policies, thanks to their access to extensive financial and political resources, which clearly is not the case or domain for the PTA plant.
This situation exemplifies the issue of concentrated benefits and dispersed costs. By levying import and anti-dumping duties, a small group of manufacturers reap the benefits, while the burden of these costs is spread across a wide array of exporters.
The imposition of high duties on PSF significantly undermines Pakistan’s textile exports by making the production of MMF economically unfeasible. This situation is discouraging for domestic textile and apparel firms considering investments in MMF production.
The disparity is in stark contrast with the cost of PSF in other countries. For instance, textile exporters in China can acquire PSF at 91 cents (Rs255) per kg, whereas in Pakistan, the price soars to around Rs362 per kg, marking a 40% increase.
Given the elevated costs of both PSF and PTA, manufacturing MMF is neither viable in the domestic market nor competitive internationally.
This leads to an understanding that the primary contributors to the unusually high PSF prices in Pakistan are the extensive import duties on PTA and PSF, coupled with additional anti-dumping duties on PSF.
Moreover, the situation is exacerbated by the ability of local manufacturers to maintain inflated prices, a consequence of the import Letter of Credit (LC) restrictions confronting the spinning industry.
These factors collectively stifle the growth of the MMF sector, highlighting the urgent need for policy revision to alleviate the burden on the textile export market.
The need to re-evaluate import and anti-dumping duties becomes critical, especially now that nearly half of Pakistan’s PSF-based spindles are shut down. As the industry aims for export resurgence amid rising demand in major western markets, the domestic supply of both cotton and PSF is insufficient to operate these machines.
This shortage is compounded by local PSF manufacturers operating at reduced capacities due to the diminished demand, a result of Pakistan’s PSF prices being significantly higher than those of its regional rivals.
Lowering the import and anti-dumping duties on PSF would facilitate enhanced production levels across the supply chain, leading to increased exports and job creation.
Lastly, enhancing exports of MMF is pivotal for bolstering Pakistan’s textile exports, a crucial step for the country to emerge from its ongoing economic difficulties.
Increasing MMF exports would diversify and strengthen the export portfolio, making it more competitive globally and instrumental in economic recovery.

3,General elections and economy,Low forex reserves unlikely to allow govt to accelerate economy in near future,"Elections have been held according to the announced date, which has ended the uncertainty surrounding the electoral process.
Initially, the election campaign remained slow owing to the lingering uncertain political situation as the country had been in the grip of rumours that the tenure of caretaker setup will be extended by considering the security and economic situation.
The campaign picked up momentum in the last 15 days. Despite these odds, the turnout of voters remained high as compared to the previous elections.
Elections provide an opportunity to the voters to choose their candidates who are willing to address their issues. If selected candidates do not fulfil their promise, they will vote out those candidates in the next polls.
Since candidates belong to a particular political party, performance of the party is judged based on the commitments made in the previous elections.
Being at the helm of affairs, the party may appease its voters by addressing certain issues. If the issues remain unaddressed, it will provide an opportunity to the opposition party to come to power.
Through the recent elections, the voters reacted to bring their favourite candidates to power.
Like previous elections, the results of the current elections are not being trusted. Apart from a couple of political parties, others are of the belief that the process and outcome have been rigged.
These parties are either staging protests, blocking roads or raising hue and cry on the digital, print and social media. A few losing candidates has accepted defeat while others are challenging results in courts of law.
Some of the losing politicians have announced their retirement. However, the heightened expectations are not allowing the system to move forward.
Read: Seen from abroad, Pakistan elections disappoint, add to instability
The mandate remained divided among the mainstream political parties. None of the parties got a simple majority in the lower house of parliament.
In the emerging situation, a coalition of political parties will form the government. Although the election manifestos of the political parties are different, they will attempt to reach a compromise.
This compromise will somehow reflect the convergence of their interests in the short term. However, the expected political stability could not be achieved. All this happened in the midst of macroeconomic stability.
Under the standby arrangement (SBA), macroeconomic stability has been achieved to some extent.
The rupee-dollar exchange rate appreciated to 280 in the last couple of months. Current account deficit (CAD) has reduced which, in turn, required net borrowing of around $750 million from July to December 2023.
The official foreign exchange reserves have been hovering around $8 billion since July 2023. In addition, acceleration in prices has slowed down slightly to 29%. Despite this stability, political situation is far from normal.
The economy has been operating well below its potential owing to foreign exchange constraints. The low foreign exchange reserves will not allow the upcoming government to accelerate the economy in the near future.
The government has to fulfil the commitments of the SBA to get the remaining $1.1 billion. Moreover, it will require dollars to meet the external contractual liabilities and has to negotiate a new programme to further stabilise the economy.
In a nutshell, timely elections are the symbol of continuity of democracy. The people of Pakistan deserve felicitation, who have exercised their right to vote through polls.
They have to accept the results of elections in the spirit of democracy. The acceptance and patience of the people will allow the politicians to deliberate on a range of possibilities and reach a consensus.
Last but not least, the upcoming government will face many challenges, which will require indigenous thinking and solution. Let us see how things unfold in future.

4,Does Pakistan need corporate tax reforms?,29% corporate and 10% super tax for companies discourages investment,"There is a direct link between corporate taxes and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Currently, Pakistan has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world: 29%, plus a 10% super tax for companies with income equal to or greater than Rs500 million, a 2% workers’ welfare fund, and a 5% workers’ participation fund. Additionally, there is a tax on dividends ranging from 15% to 25% (which is actually a case of double taxation).
Corporate taxes hinder companies from engaging in activities we desire them to pursue: innovation, employment generation, production of high-quality products at low costs, and competitiveness.
The fundamental goal of any corporation is to maximise shareholder wealth, a challenging task under the best circumstances but doubly so given the tax burden imposed by our government.
The mere existence of a profit tax raises questions about the criteria politicians use to decide what and how to tax. In Pakistan, we tax the living day light out of profitable companies, while simultaneously, giving bailouts, tax credits, and subsidies to losing companies, including State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).
Our shortsighted politicians and bureaucrats believe that our economy is insulated from the global economy. However, corporations have options. They can and do operate across national borders, and taxes—specifically corporate taxes in different countries—affect corporate behaviour.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Pakistan remains at an average of $1 billion per year and has been stagnant for the past five years. In contrast, FDI in 11 Southeast Asian countries increased by 40% between 2017 and 2022, from $150 billion to $210 billion.
For a whole host of reasons, government leaders in Southeast Asian countries aim to increase domestic business and are willing to compete politically for it. Policymakers have limited tools to attract and retain businesses, and the corporate tax rate is likely the most important of these tools. The corporate tax creates powerful incentives and is a significant factor in determining where a company chooses to locate its operations.
Read: Seven keys to good tax policy
Pakistan’s corporate tax code is ripe for reform. The ideal corporate tax rate to stimulate more investment (both foreign and domestic) is a 20% flat-rate corporate tax with no deductions. This would significantly reduce the complexity inherent in our progressive tax system, which is riddled with loopholes, exemptions, and special interest carve-outs.
Lowering the corporate tax rate is a supply-side approach for countries to advertise and promote themselves in a competitive global economy. Pakistan has lagged behind in this regard, as many neighbouring countries have dramatically reduced their corporate income tax rates.
Lower corporate tax rates are associated with higher investment-to-GDP and State GDP growth, faster employment growth, and, most importantly, higher government tax revenues and foreign exchange reserves.
In addition, a corporate tax rate cut would lead to improved equity valuations. In static terms (for example, revenues and costs remain the same), a corporate tax rate cut would significantly impact the value of companies. For example, when companies consider investing in new projects, they calculate the net present value of the after-tax cash flows generated by that project. A decrease in tax rates increases the expected after-tax cash flows of an investment, prompting companies to invest in more projects, employ more labour and capital, leading to overall prosperity in the economy and higher market capitalisation of companies, as well as more money flowing into the stock market. Additionally, the Treasury would benefit as the lower tax rate would generate increased tax revenues. Corporate tax reform is truly a win-win-win.
