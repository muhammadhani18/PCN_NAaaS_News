0,Labour vacuum affecting furniture exports,This shortage was attributed to various factors including limited vocational training programmes,"Pakistan’s furniture industry is grappling with a severe shortage of skilled woodworkers, triggering significant delays in the shipment of export consignments and affecting the industry’s efficiency, repute and profitability. 
Pakistan Furniture Council (PFC) Chief Executive Officer Mian Kashif Ashfaq stated this while addressing a delegation of furniture manufacturers led by Faryad Ahmed Raza on Sunday. He said that woodworking skills are fundamental in the furniture manufacturing process, from crafting intricate designs to ensuring the structural integrity of pieces. However, the demand for skilled woodworkers in Pakistan exceeds the available workforce. 
This shortage was attributed to various factors including limited vocational training programmes, low wages and a lack of interest among the young generation to pursue careers in woodworking, he added. The PFC chief said that export-oriented furniture manufacturers heavily rely on timely deliveries to maintain customer satisfaction and uphold the global market.
However, the scarcity of skilled woodworkers has led to production bottlenecks, prolonging lead times and jeopardizing shipment schedules, he mentioned.

1,Time to restore public confidence in police,Crackdown on political workers leaves department’s image-building in tatters,"The Punjab Police top brass for the past over two decades has been struggling to build a positive, soft image of the department.
Other than official pronouncements and meetings, “Changing the thana (policing) culture” has been a slogan of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) during all these years.
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), even before forming its government in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), had been eagerly vowing “de-politicisation of police stations and making them public-friendly”.
Billions of rupees have been pumped over the years into different projects -- the most recent one of turning over 700 police stations in Punjab into lucratively designed, well-furnished Special Initiative Police Stations (SIPS) with a motive described as promoting community policing.
However, all the efforts seem to have been lost after involvement in a targeted crackdown against the workers of a political party since May last year. 
The acts of blatant abuse of power, violating the sanctity of home and person, harassment of women, children and other family members, illegal detentions, even horrific allegations of sexual harassment, were initially justified as necessary to create deterrence for the protection of institutions and symbols of national integration. 
Post May 9, initially the law enforcement agencies enjoyed a moral high ground. 
As Hegel’s dialectics describes in “unity of opposites”, after a certain saturation point, a thing, idea or value loses its essence and transforms into its opposite.
As the details of gruesome acts of violence and inhumane treatment in the guise of manhunt for the perpetrators came into public eyes, thanks to a party’s vibrant social media cell, the moral grounds were lost. 
At a polling booth on February 8, a constable lamented that they too were fed up with the immoral acts deemed cultural taboo that they had been forced to do. 
An SP said he had closely witnessed a transformation in police’s behaviour after the raids on homes and feared that nothing in his house, from household items to family members, would remain safe.
After the General Elections 2024 were announced, the same issue was used to block the PTI from launching a campaign, a fundamental, constitutional right, and the party’s political gatherings were dispersed
People were targeted even in remote villages. In an incident, an advocate of Lahore High Court, Khalid Khan Ranjha’s house was raided by over three dozen unidentified officials and allegedly taken to an undisclosed location along with 70-year-old ailing father in Koray Koth, a small village of Sargodha district. 
Their crime allegedly was of launching a door-to-door campaign for a PTI-supported candidate.
The home of another LHC advocate, Rai Faisal, was raided multiple times in Syed Wala, a village in Nankana Sahib. 
A large number of activists were allegedly abducted before the election day.
The election day has passed but the police’s targeting political activists has not come to a halt. Two days back, a video went viral of a man being dragged out of his car at Liberty Roundabout in front of his children and wife for carrying a flag.
A philosopher said that the people at large do not have opportunities of high formal learning but they learn from their experiences. 
Development of public consciousness is a tedious process but hard to transform or dodge.
The Punjab Police cannot build a trustworthy, public-friendly image after acting as a tool of coercion to curb political dissent. 
Even if it starts once again the quest for changing its culture and continues for the next two decades, a few months of a role similar to that experienced during the past year will bring it back to the square one.
The departments, especially the police command, must sit together and decide at once never to trespass their role defined in the constitution and laws.
In the long run, this is the only way to win public goodwill.

2,Detained murderer dies in encounter,Police blame accomplices for death of schoolteacher in detention,"A man suspected of kidnapping and murdering an MPhil scholar was killed allegedly in a police encounter near Madani Colony in a densely populated locality of Bahawalnagar.
The suspect was also well-educated and a teacher in a government school. Bahawalnagar police spokesperson Zahid Rasool Khan told The Express Tribune that Talha Arshad, who had completed MPhil in food sciences and was PhD student, had been kidnapped and later shot dead in the head last month. His body was sealed in a box and dumped into an old well. 
The kidnappers had taken the mobile phone of the victim to Sahiwal and demanded Rs10 million in ransom through a message to release him. After two days, the kidnappers had gone to Donga Bonga on the suburbs of the city and reduced their demand to Rs8 million, threatening to kill the youth if his family did not pay the ransom. 
A couple of days later, they went to Manchanabad and against demand the ransom. 
In an apparent bid to mislead the police, the kidnapers accuse Talha of harassing women. They also sent a video clip to the family, showing Talha tied with ropes.
After the repeated threats, the family of the victim paid a ransom of $4,000 and $500 more on January 29.
The following day, a call was received by of rescue hotline 15 that a box was floating in a well, upon which Sub-Inspector Wahab Aslam reached the spot and pulled out the box with the help of Rescue 1122 officials.
The decomposing body of Talha Arshad was found in the box.
After the discovery of the body, the police had arrested two prime suspects in the case. The police were taking the suspect Hameed to help find Talha's motorcycle on Friday night when his accomplices allegedly opened fire on them.
According to the police spokesman, Hameed was killed by the firing of his accomplices who managed to escape after the encounter.
The police shifted the body to a hospital for postmortem.
The city’s traders had observed a strike and staged a protest sit-in against the police after the murder of the kidnapped youth, after which the DPO had promised steps to ensure justice in the case.
A team had identified a house used by the suspects with the help of information technology and arrested the suspects after keeping it under surveillance.
