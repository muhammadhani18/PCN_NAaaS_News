0,PTI leader demands judicial inquiry against CEC,Shaheen claims wrongdoings in general elections,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Shoaib Shaheen has said that he has written an open letter to the chief justice of Pakistan, requesting him to remove the chief election commissioner until a judicial inquiry into the allegations of wrongdoings in the recently held elections is completed.
“The Rawalpindi commissioner says that his mental balance was bad while he was appointed one-and-a-half years ago. Commissioner Liaquat Chattha's connection with the PML-N has come to light as there are pictures of him with Hamza Shehbaz (son of PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif),” the PTI leader said while holding a news conference at his office on Sunday.
He said that if the conscience of Liaquat Chatta had awakened, then at least a judicial inquiry should be conducted.
“Not admitting mistakes has become a habit of the bureaucracy,” he said.
He claimed that three returning officers were told to tell him if there were any objections against him, but when the results came, they rejected his papers.
“In the bureaucracy, the one who speaks the truth is said to be mentally unbalanced.”
“I will not leave anyone, including Tariq Fazal Chaudhry [Shaheen’s rival in the general elections for NA-47 Islamabad]. I have written an open letter to the chief justice,” the PTI leader said, adding that if the elections were held again, they would not be able to show their face to anyone.
He said that he had requested the chief justice to take suo motu notice and keep the CEC on the side until a transparent inquiry was completed.
“It is not appropriate for the CEC to remain in office until the judicial inquiry is completed.”

1,IHC takes stern action against violation LNG case,Issues notices to high-ranking officials including FBR chairman,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has taken serious notice of the persistent breach of its orders in the Pakistan LNG case, issuing notices to high-ranking officials, including the chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the member operations-IR, and tax employees of the Islamabad tax office.
The notices were served in response to the allegedly unauthorised recovery attempts through the attachment of bank accounts belonging to power distribution companies (DISCOS).
The court has mandated appearances for February 22 (Thursday).
Reliable sources reveal that the DISCO, after the prolonged silence from FBR/LTO Islamabad, took legal action through tax lawyer Waheed Shahzad Butt.
The petition raises concerns over the alleged tax robbery tactic, executed without proper legal procedure, and in direct violation of the IHC's binding order in the Pakistan LNG case. The petition contends that the matter had not been clarified despite previous instructions from FBR regarding the necessity of obtaining prior approval from the member operations.
Waheed Butt asserts that certain tax employees at the Islamabad tax office are openly flouting FBR instructions regarding the attachment of bank accounts of DISCOS, National Transmission & Dispatch Company (NTDC), and Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA).The lawyer said that the instructions issued in C. No. 6 (21) S (IR-Operations)/ 2017/ 35481-R dated 20.03.2017 have been blatantly ignored and violated by LTOs without any apprehension of accountability, a claim reaffirmed by the parent agency (FBR) on November 27, 2023.
IHC after hearing the DISCO argument issued notices to the Secretary Revenue Division, Member (Operations), Chief CIR, CIR and DCIR, Zone-II, LTO, Islamabad.
IHC order states, “The petitioner is aggrieved by recovery notices dated 22.02.2023 pursuant to which coercive recovery has been affected from the accounts of the petitioner. The learned counsel for the petitioner states that the assessment order was pending adjudication before the commissioner (Appeals), who by order dated 21.02.2023 had dismissed the petitioner’s appeal. Such order was communicated to the petitioner at 02:00 p.m. on 22.02.2023.”
However, without issuing any prior notice after the dismissal of the petitioner’s appeal or even the communication of the appeal order to the petitioner, coercive recovery was affected at 09:00 a.m. on 22.02.2023 in breach of law.
“He states that the coercive recovery is also in breach of the instructions issued by FBR to the Commissioner, by letter dated 20.03.2017 directing the Commissioners that coercive recoveries are not to be affected against discourse without the prior approval of FBR,” it said.
The court has set the next hearing for February 22, demanding reports and para-wise comments from the respondents.

2,PPP to form govt in Balochistan despite challenges,Bugti observed that parties were resorting to criticism and accusations against institutions where they faced defeat,"Former interior minister Sarfraz Bugti on Sunday said that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) will form a government in Balochistan despite what he termed as ""heinous actions"" by nationalist parties.
Addressing a press conference alongside members of the parliamentary party from Balochistan, Bugti asserted that the PPP, being a federal party with representation from all four provinces, accepted the election results in the interest of Pakistan, even in the face of alleged rigging.
He shared there was an increasing influx of independents aligning themselves with the PPP after the elections. He pointed out that since the nationalist parties tasted drubbing and faced challenges, they were raising hue and cry.
In a pointed remark, Bugti further observed that nationalist parties tend to claim righteousness in areas of victory while resorting to criticism and accusations against institutions in regions where they face defeat.
Commenting on the language used by BNP’s Akhtar Mengal, Bugti criticised it as unfit for any civilised politician. He asserted that nationalists are struggling to comprehend the PPP's mandate.

3,K-P MPAs can join political party by tomorrow,ECP issued gazette notification of winners on 36 NA and 90 PA seats,"The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) issued the gazette notification late on Saturday, announcing the successful candidates for the national and provincial assembly constituencies of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. It encouraged the independent candidates to join any political party of their choice, should they wish to do so.
Elections in the province were held for 44 National Assembly seats and 113 constituencies of the provincial assembly on February 8. The ECP held back the announcement of the results of eight National Assembly and 23 K-P Assembly for various reasons.
Most of the winners in the provinces are the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) backed candidates, who contested the elections as independents because the ECP had denied the party of its electoral symbol of ‘bat’ because of its controversial intra-party elections.
As per the law, the independent candidates could join any political party within three days of the issuance of the gazette notification; otherwise, they would remain independents till the tenure of the assembly.
Consequently, the newly elected National Assembly members (MNAs) have until Monday (today) to join a political party, should they decide. Similarly, the newly-elected members of the provincial assembly (MPAs) have until Tuesday (tomorrow) to take the decision.
The newly-elected MNAs include Ali Amin Gandapur from NA 44; Sibghatullah, NA-4; Gohar Ali Khan, NA-10; Omar Ayub Khan, NA-18; Asad Qaiser, NA-19; Shandana Gulzar, NA-30; Shehryar Afridi, NA-35; Sher Afzal Marwat, NA-41; and others.
Gandapur, who has been nominated by the PTI as its candidate for the post of K-P chief minister, had also won a provincial assembly seat PK-113, Dera Ismail Khan. However, the notification issued on Saturday night did not include his name, which was notified on Sunday.
The gazette notification of eight National Assembly constituencies in K-P, which had not been issued so far, include Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Quaid Nawaz Sharif's constituency of NA-15 Mansehra, PML-N Provincial President Amir Muqam's constituency of NA-11 Shangla besides NA-27 Khyber, NA-28 Peshawar, NA-38 Karak, NA-40 North Waziristan and NA-43 Tank.
The 23 withheld results of the K-P Assembly constituencies include 8 constituencies of Peshawar – PK-72, PK-73, PK-74, PK-75, PK-78, PK-79, PK-80 and PK-82. The other constituencies include PK-20 and 21, Bajaur; PK 28, 29, and 30, Shangla; PK-40 Mansehra; PK-41 Torghar; PK-44 Abbottabad; PK-95 Kurram; PK-101 and 102, Bannu: and PK-103, North Waziristan
Before the elections, the ECP postponed the voting in Bajaur district’s constituencies of NA-8, and PK-22 because of the assassination of a candidate Rehan Zeb. The voting for PK-91, Kohat was postponed after the death of candidate Ismatullah.
Sindh & Punjab
The ECP has been notifying the success of candidates in due course. On February 13, it announced the victory of Mian Azhar, a PTI-backed independent candidate for NA-129, Lahore, besides 54 newly-elected independent MNAs on February 16.
Now, the ECP has also notified the success of seven independent Sindh MPAs. They are Ejaz Khan, PS-88; Wajid Khan, PS-92; Nazar Mehmood, PS-93; Mohammad Owais, PS-96; Bilal Hussain Jadoon, PS-109; Rehan, PS-110; Sarbuland Khan, PS-112; and Muhammad Shabbir, PS-114.
However, apparently, a lack of decision-making by the PTI leadership, regarding joining a party, eliminated the chances of getting reserved seats for women and minorities under articles 51 and 106 of the Constitution.
According to the Rule 92 (6) of Election Rules 2017, the winning independent candidates can formally inform the ECP regarding their decision of joining a political party within three days of the issuance of gazette notification of their victory. Otherwise, the candidate will remain as independent.
Those notified on Friday could join a political party by Monday. However, Mian Azhar failed to produce any document related to his joining any party within the specified period. Therefore, he would remain as independent, according to sources.
According to ECP sources, so far the affidavit of joining the PML-N had been received only from Raja Khurram Nawaz, who won in NA-48. The ECP had established facilitation centre for the independent candidates for joining political parties.

4,Call for accountability amidst chaos,Identifying those responsible for alleged rigging on Feb 8 is deemed crucial,"The resonance of Pakistan's 2024 elections has gone far beyond its borders, with regional and international media vehemently denouncing the process as exceptionally unfair, non-transparent, and heavily rigged in the nation’s history.
In the midst of this uproar, an informal alliance comprising the PTI, the JUI, the JI, the GDA and some other smaller groups has been mobilizing nationwide protests against the alleged rigging, adding another layer to an already complex and highly unstable political scenario.
The startling admission by the Rawalpindi division commissioner, Liaqat Ali Chatha, has introduced yet another layer of turmoil to the nation's precarious political landscape.
His shocking revelation of orchestrating large-scale election rigging, including addition of forged votes and manipulation of results, has sent shockwaves through the country.
Here a question emerges: if the commissioner’s avowal is true then why should only he bear the consequences while the alleged masterminds behind these machinations spanning dozens of national and provincial assemblies’ constituencies across the country remain untouched?
The responsibility for these shameless acts of election rigging squarely falls on the interim government, because its only mandate was to stay in power till a new government elected through a process of free and fair elections comes to power.
However, the motivations and driving forces behind such manipulations remain a puzzle which needs unravelling to shed light on the murky underbelly of Pakistan's political system.
Analyzing the power dynamics, the blame game unfolds across many potential bases of power: The Interim government, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the PML-N and the PPP, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), the establishment and the superior judiciary.
Despite the interim government's significant leverage over civil servants, it lacks the power to coerce them into such egregious acts of betrayal.
The ECP, often perceived as having authority over district returning officers (DROs), lacks the influence to prevent the civil administration from engaging in election rigging.
However, like these elections, many past elections have highlighted the ECP’s failure to incorporate mechanisms ensuring transparency in the polling and result tabulation process, demanding a thorough investigation.
Despite being granted legal powers and resources through comprehensive legislative mechanisms, the ECP consistently introduces so-called novel technology-based systems in every election, only to face repeated failures.
Following the 2018 RTS debacle, the much-anticipated Election Management System, designed to compile and transmit results promptly, also faltered in the February 8 elections.
Political powerhouses like the PML-N in Punjab, the PPP in Sindh, and the MQM-P in Karachi, known for their ability to foster loyalties, are considered insufficient to coerce the civil bureaucracy into committing crimes that could dangerously plunge the country into a civil strife.
The establishment, recognized for its independent actions, allegedly asserts dominance over civilian institutions, relegating them to inconsequential roles.
In weak democracies with a lack of public awareness and collective will, civilians find it challenging to enforce their authority over the armed forces, enabling the establishment to flout oaths and disregard constitutional limits.
The role of the superior judiciary, especially in cases with political ramifications, demands a thorough review. A glance at the judicial history of the last two decades reveals a pattern where court decisions impact the country’s political landscape. If the PML-N bore the brunt in 2018, the PTI suffered in 2024.
An investigation should also be launched to find out whether the internet infrastructure was adequately equipped for election-related communications and scrutinize consultations between the ECP and the PTA regarding online election system readiness.
Identifying those responsible for maintaining the integrity of internet services and holding them accountable for any lapses contributing to nationwide anxiety during elections is crucial.
Commissioner Chatha's admission of responsibility, deflecting blame from the real players, underscores the coercion faced by individuals and their families until they capitulate.
A comprehensive investigation is imperative to restore public confidence in Pakistan’s electoral infrastructure. Yet, a looming question is who will conduct such an investigation in a country where serious national crimes are often swept under the carpet?
Political parties victimized in one election become integral to maneuvering in the next, perpetuating a vicious cycle. The influential ruling class continues to thrive at the expense of the suffering masses who cast their votes, while ordinary political workers endure hardships, hoping for a better future.
However, this status quo cannot persist indefinitely. Reflecting on the debacle of 1971 and enduring crises over the past decades, the country grapples with economic stagnation, a burgeoning population, and serious environmental threats without foreseeable solutions.  A transformative shift is needed for a better future, challenging the prevailing narrative and steering Pakistan toward lasting change.

5,SC to hear plea for annulment of polls tomorrow,"CJ expresses anger at no-show of petitioner, orders police to serve court notice on petitioner","Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa on Monday expressed his anger at the absence of a petitioner who had filed the petition for annulment of the February 8 general elections, and sought the apex court’s order for re-election in the country.

A three-member bench led by the chief justice and comprising Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali took up the petition.

The court staff informed the bench that a notice was sent to petitioner Brig (retd) Ali Khan at his home address but it was not complied with, while his mobile phone was switched off and no contact could be established via WhatsApp either.

The chief justice asked whether it was a joke that first a petition was filed and it was publicised in the media and the social media and then the petitioner did not show up in court.

“This attitude cannot be tolerated,” he added. Was this petition filed for fame, the chief justice asked, adding that the court would hear the case.

A court order later said that the petition was filed on Feb 12 and before filing the plea, publicity was made in electronic and print media.

The Registrar's Office raised objections to the petition, but considering the importance of the case, the petition was fixed for hearing with the registrar's objections.

However, the order said, after filing the petition and gaining maximum publicity, the petitioner filed another plea for withdrawing the petition.

Normally, the court said, an applicant was entitled to withdraw the plea but in this case, the petitioner exploited the situation and achieved his personal objective.

The court order said that the petitioner was being given another chance, therefore, apart from the usual practice, court notices should be complied with through the concerned police station house officer (SHO). As the petitioner was a retired brigadier, the notice should also be complied with through the defence ministry.

The hearing was adjourned till Wednesday (tomorrow).

7,PM vows to punish trolls targeting civil servants,Kakar says some elements using different tricks to blackmail them into switching loyalties,"Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Monday said that the state of Pakistan shall defend the civil servants in discharging their constitutional duties, act against the “violent trolls” and ensure “exemplary punishment” to them.

The statement came days after the Rawalpindi commissioner confessed to his ""involvement in rigging election results in the city"", and resigned from his post demanding to be ""hanged for doing injustice"" to the Rawalpindi Division.

During a news conference at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, Liaquat Ali Chattha claimed that 13 candidates from Pindi were forcefully declared winners, adding that ""we gave the losing candidates leads of 50,000 votes"".

“I have done injustice to the Rawalpindi Division,"" he said. ""I tried to commit suicide today after Fajr prayer. But then I thought, why should I die a forbidden death? Why not put everything in front of the people?” he said.

""I accept the responsibility of election rigging in Rawalpindi Division and surrender myself to the police,"" he said.

However, Chattha’s allegations have been denied by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the newly appointed Rawalpindi commissioner as well.

“There should be no doubt about our commitment to these noble civil servants serving the state and the people of Pakistan,” the premier said in a statement issued by his office on Monday.

PM Kakar said that the people of Pakistan had spoken with a clear voice on Feb 8 and had given a split mandate.

“Some elements with a proven track record of violent behaviour and vigilantism are now using different tricks, including weaponisation of social media, to blackmail and pressure civil servants into switch their loyalties from the State of Pakistan to the violent gang,” he added.

The premier said that the actions of these elements were in clear violation of Article 5 and other articles of the Constitution and the laws of the land.

“The state of Pakistan shall defend the civil servants in discharging their constitutional duties, act against these violent troll,s and ensure exemplary punishment to them. There should be no doubt about our commitment to these noble civil servants serving the State and the people of Pakistan,” he concluded.

A day earlier, Maryam Nawaz, the PML-N’s chief organiser and nominee for the Punjab chief minister’s slot, echoing similar sentiments, warned that legal action would be taken against those who were inciting the bureaucracy to break the law – indirectly referring to the PTI.

Maryam wrote on social media platform X that threatening the bureaucracy meant creating chaos in the state system, and an open indulgence in this practice was an invitation to disaster.

Addressing the bureaucracy, Maryam said officers should not be intimidated by threats and perform their duties according to the law.

The PML-N leader continued that those who threatened the security of the officers would be dealt with “iron hands”.

She vowed to ensure the security of the officers.

8,ECP panel seeks transcript of Chatha’s presser,Probe committee to record testimonies of ROs from 13 NA constituencies of Rawalpindi,"A high-level probe panel, formed by the country’s polls oversight authority on Sunday to investigate the allegations of mass rigging in Rawalpindi division, has started its proceedings.

According to sources in the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the committee, in its first meeting on Monday, directed the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) to submit a transcript of Rawalpindi division’s former commissioner Liaquat Ali Chatha's explosive press conference.

Chatha sent shockwaves through the country on Saturday by claiming that massive rigging took place in all 13 National Assembly constituencies of Rawalpindi under his watch in the February 8 elections.
Taking responsibility for what he termed a “heinous crime”, Chatha implicated not only himself but also accused the chief election commissioner and the chief justice of Pakistan of complicity.

In a stunning admission, Chatha announced his intention to surrender to the authorities, acknowledging his role in tampering with the electoral outcome by turning the tables and flipping losers into winners.
A day after the incident, the ECP announced the formation of a high-level committee to probe the allegations. On Monday, the six district returning officers (DROs) of Rawalpindi division submitted their written statements to the committee.

According to sources, the committee will record testimonies of the returning officers (ROs) from the 13 NA constituencies. Additionally, the special committee will seal the statements of the ROs from 26 Punjab Assembly constituencies that fall within Rawalpindi.

Meanwhile, Caretaker Minister for Information Murtaza Solangi stated that the ECP has launched a probe into the claims made by Rawalpindi's former commissioner. “We should trust our institutions and system. While legal action is ongoing, we should wait,” he said while talking to the media in Islamabad.

Speaking about the formation of a new government at the center, Solangi said that as soon as the final list of successful candidates in the elections is issued, a summary will be sent to the prime minister for convening a session of the National Assembly.

“After approval from the prime minister, a request will be made to the president for calling a session of the National Assembly,” he said, adding that the caretaker government has fulfilled its responsibilities.
