0,Trans transforming young lives,Kami teaches the art of beautification to young girls from diverse backgrounds in Ibrahim Hyderi,"In the labyrinthine alleys of Ibrahim Hyderi, amidst the scent of saltwater and the hum of daily life, a centre radiates hope and transformation. Here, Kamran, affectionately known as Kami, and his friend, Ali, are rewriting the script for the transgender community in the country's male-dominated society.
At the tender age of 25, Kami stands as a pillar of inspiration at a local centre in Ibrahim Hyderi, a fishing community on the edge of the teeming metropolis of millions of people. Young girls from diverse backgrounds gather to learn the art of beautification, all under Kami's expert tutelage and free of cost.
For Saima, a 21-year-old student, Kami's presence not only brings comfort and security but also instills confidence. ""The way Kami teaches is amazing,"" she shares. ""It gives me the assurance that despite the odds, one can develop skills and succeed.""
Born and raised in Ibrahim Hyderi, Kami's journey to earning respect and dignity has been marked by resilience and determination. In a society where acceptance for the transgender community is often a distant dream, Kami and his peers have defied convention and embraced a path less traveled.
""People love us. They respect us by heart,"" Kami affirms with a smile, his eyes glistening with pride. His belief in the power of hard work has propelled him forward, leading him to join the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum (PFF) as an instructor and beautician.

For over 15 months, Kami has dedicated himself to empowering the young girls of Ibrahim Hyderi, Bangali Para, and neighbouring areas. Under his guidance, more than a thousand girls have embarked on three to six-month courses, gaining valuable skills that promise a brighter future.
But Kami is not alone in his mission. His friend Ali, aged 33, stands by his side as an instructor for stitching classes at the PFF. Like Kami, Ali exudes dedication and passion, earning the trust and respect of his community through his commitment to excellence.
""At home, I receive the same respect,"" Ali shares, his gaze shifting to the attentive students in his class.
In a family of 11, Ali plays a pivotal role in maintaining financial stability, working tirelessly to ensure a comfortable life for his loved ones. Despite the challenges they face, Kami and Ali refuse to succumb to despair. Instead, they embrace every opportunity to uplift themselves and those around them.
Their presence at the centre has not gone unnoticed by the community. Syed Qambar Shah, a resident of Ibrahim Hyderi, acknowledges the profound impact of their appointment. ""With the inclusion of transgender individuals at the centre, our community feels a sense of security,"" he reflects. For Ferzana, a student of Ali, the centre serves as a beacon of hope for girls from humble backgrounds.
Both Kami and Ali understand the importance of self-reliance and determination. They actively seek opportunities to inspire others, whether through their teaching or their culinary skills. For Kami, teaching at the PFF center is not just a job - it's an honor. It grants him a sense of identity and belonging, reaffirming his place in society.
In a world where prejudice and discrimination often reign supreme, Kami and Ali stand as symbols of resilience and hope. Through their unwavering commitment to education and empowerment, they are not only transforming lives but also reshaping societal norms. As they continue to pave the way for a more inclusive future, their journey serves as a testament to the power of courage, compassion, and community.

2,Unabated rise of unlawful structures ravages city,Work resumed on 50 unauthorised structures demolished earlier,"In the labyrinth of Karachi's bustling streets, the specter of illegal constructions looms large, defying the recent crackdowns and raising concerns about the city's architectural integrity. Despite the fervent efforts to dismantle illicit edifices, a resurgence in unauthorized building projects, purportedly aided by complicit officers within the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), paints a disheartening picture.
Scores of clandestine constructions have once again taken root, reminiscent of a tenacious weed pushing through cracks in the pavement. From clandestine penthouses to unauthorized extensions and unpermitted storefronts, these structures defy legal formalities, flouting surveys and land usage regulations with brazen audacity.
The enigmatic silence of the SBCA's Director-General shrouds the issue in mystery, leaving questions unanswered and concerns unaddressed. Despite inquiries from The Express Tribune, a void of accountability persists, amplifying suspicions of collusion with the nefarious elements driving this illegal construction spree.

Insiders whisper of deep-rooted connections between the illegal construction syndicate and the provincial establishment, hinting at a web of influence that shields perpetrators from justice. Despite the demolition of over fifty illicit buildings in the central district over the past half-year, the phoenix of illegal construction rises once more, threatening to further erode the city's already strained infrastructure.
The unauthorised construction extends its reach far beyond the central district, encroaching upon neighborhoods like Federal B Area, North Nazimabad, North Karachi, and New Karachi.
Attempts to reach SBCA DG Ishaq Khoro yielded no response, underscoring the veil of silence shrouding the SBCA's corridors. Sources suggest a resurgence of the old guard within the authority, a cabal of influential figures allegedly orchestrating illegal constructions under the guise of authority.

3,Gerrymandering polls compromised nation’s suffrage: Palijo,QAT chief said that the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) has exposed the bogus election,"Gerrymandering polls compromised nation's suffrage, said Qomi Awami Tehreek (QAT) head Ayaz Latif Palijo on Sunday.
According to a statement, the QAT chief said that the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) has exposed the bogus election. He continued that the fake election has proved to be a fraud and an attack on democracy with 250 million people of Pakistan and Sindh. 
The mafias who could not win in the elections, now buy the elections. On February 20, under the leadership of Pir Sahib Pagara, millions of people will reject the bogus election in the public meeting to be held in Moro. 
He said that the People's Party has been in power for 15 years and if it wanted, it would have made Sindh the centre of industries, agriculture would have been brought out of the crisis and Sindh would have been made fertile, life would have flourished in Kachhu, Kohistan along with Thar, unemployment and misery would have been ended and our cities would have become IT cities, but menace of corruption has destroyed the institutions of Sindh. Zardari mafia does not want Sindh to develop, for which they have made the people of Sindh poor and jobless and made them a voting machine for money.

4,"GDA condemns PPP’s allegations, calls for transparent elections",Mallah lamented the lack of integrity within the electoral process,"The Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) vehemently rebuked Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Shazai Marri's accusations of electoral malpractice, asserting their demand for fair and transparent elections. 
GDA leader Zulfikar Mallah urged the Chief Justice of Pakistan and the Army Chief to nullify the results of the recent general elections and ensure the conduct of fresh, untainted polls.
During a press conference in Hyderabad, they appealed to civil servants within the Sindh government to refrain from bowing to PPP's influence. Mallah, in a fervent plea to these officials, emphasized the transient nature of power dynamics, urging them to uphold principles of justice and fairness.
Mallah underscored the irony of Marri and Mahesh Malani's allegations, given PPP's historical entrenchment in power in Sindh. 
He pointed out the glaring contradictions, highlighting the extensive control PPP wielded over electoral machinery and personnel, casting doubts on the legitimacy of their complaints.
Drawing attention to reported instances of coercion and manipulation at polling stations, Mallah denounced the intimidation tactics allegedly employed by PPP-affiliated presiding officers, particularly targeting female voters. At some polling stations, the officials were telling women voters that they would stop receiving Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) payments if the vote against PPP.

He lamented the lack of integrity within the electoral process, citing Commissioner Rawalpindi Liaquat Chatta's revelations as a beacon of hope for accountability.
Mallah reminisced about the longstanding political legacy of the Arbab family in Thar, tracing back to the pre-partition era, and lamented their recent defeat, attributing it to the pernicious influence of fraudulent practices and financial corruption. He called for a thorough investigation into the alleged rigging and emphasized the need for re-elections to restore faith in Pakistan's democratic processes.
In a scathing indictment, Mallah accused Malani's associates of orchestrating electoral fraud in Mithi city and beyond, questioning the authorities' failure to address these grievances promptly.
The GDA's stance reflects a steadfast commitment to upholding the principles of democracy and transparency, as they rally against the encroachment of electoral integrity.

5,CEC urged to apologise to nation,"PTI Sindh chief accuses poll watchdog head of failing to hold timely, credible polls","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh has called for the chief electioncCommissioner (CEC) to tender an apology to the nation or face consequences under Article 6 for his alleged role in rigging the Feb 8 general election.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi on Sunday, accompanied by PTI Sindh General Secretary Advocate Ali Palh and others, Sheikh criticised the CEC for failing to conduct timely and transparent elections, alleging contempt of the people's mandate.
Sheikh revealed a recent presentation in Islamabad highlighted how 80 seats, won by PTI-backed Independent candidates as per Form 45, were allegedly manipulated by changing Form 47. He claimed that this manipulation was exposed by the commissioner Rawalpindi who made a damning revelation on Saturday.
Sheikh, who was released last week after spending 171 days in jail, emphasised the challenges he faced and drew a comparison to Indian spy Kalbhushan Yadav's situation. He declared victory for the nation and the Kaptaan on February 8, asserting possession of all Form 45s from Karachi, including those from his constituency NA-238.
Addressing the media's role, Sheikh accused the PML-N of lacking confidence in the media. He claimed PTI's success in winning 20 out of 22 NA seats in Karachi and two out of three NA seats in Hyderabad, demanding the release of true results based on Form 45s.

Sheikh provided specific examples of alleged discrepancies, citing instances where PTI candidates appeared to have lost despite significant voter support. He called for the return of seats allegedly snatched from the PTI.
Advocate Ali Palh echoed Sheikh's sentiments, claiming that PTI's votes were robbed, workers attacked, and their mandate snatched. 
Palh expressed readiness for Form 45 verification, suggested the chief justice could intervene, and demanded the return of allegedly stolen seats to the PTI.
During the press conference, former MPA Jamal Siddiqui, former MNA Aftab Jahangir, and various PTI candidates were also present.
Sharing details, Haleem said, ""We have all Form 45s of Karachi and all this data is put on the Internet.""
The PTI leader said PTI gave the media Form 45s from each and every polling stations, but PML-N showed lack of confidence in the media.
Haleem said from 22 NA seats of Karachi, we won 20 seats and from three NA seats of Hyderabad we won two. He said we won 40 PA seats from Karachi. He said seats of GDA were stolen from interior Sindh. He said Jamaat-e-Islami also won some seats from Karachi. He said Hafiz Naeem showed moral courage by fortifying his seat.

8,FUUAST entangled in financial quandary,"Administration is in debt to teachers, examination staff and vendors for the past three years","In addition to a competent administration, a stable supply of funding is also important for the smooth functioning of any higher education institution however, both seem to be missing in the unfortunate case of the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Sciences & Technology (FUUAST), which has been battling a severe shortage of funds given the inept management of finances by its supervisory board since the past three years.
The institution, which was established in 2002, came under the governments radar after a mind-boggling report prepared by the acting Vice Chancellor Dr Rubina Mushtaq, came to the fore during a Senate meeting for the appointment of a new Vice Chancellor, which stated that the FUUAST was on the verge of bankruptcy since it had failed to conduct daily operations or provide wages and pensions to its staff since November 2023.
“It is the responsibility of the Vice-Chancellor to keep the university afloat. Only people who are responsible should be appointed for this designation. The university has no permanent Vice-Chancellor, and everyone in the admin is preoccupied with their own issues. Unfortunately, the admin of the FUUAST does not have a serious attitude in the Senate, because of which its matters aren’t dealt with,” regretted Dr Pirzada Qasim, founding Vice-Chancellor of FUUAST, who further revealed that universities in the public sector required grants for operating since the revenue generated from student fee was not enough.
Read: FUUAST, HEC embroiled in controversy
According to statistics obtained by the Express Tribune the present administration of the FUUAST is in debt to teachers, examination staff and vendors amounting to almost Rs1200 million since various dues including salaries, pensions, commutation allowances, leave encashment, honorariums for thesis evaluation have not been paid for the last three years; Rs159 million to 50 employees for commutation, Rs26 million to 24 employees for leave encashment, Rs50 million for an honorarium for thesis evaluation, and Rs105 million for an honorarium for part-time teachers are due. Hence, in the current fiscal year, a loss of around Rs934 million has been anticipated based on the ratio of income and expenditure.
Furthermore, in order to maintain the day to day operations of the university an immediate recovery of Rs1700 million is required in addition to the aforementioned budget.
What has greatly exacerbated the degree of financial loss is the decline in the admission of students, which been a common trend across many public higher education institutions in light of the nation’s economic circumstances.
“Right now, the biggest issue is the availability of funds since the federal government is not ready to provide any additional funding given its commitment to the IMF that no more funding will be provided to any institution. In such a scenario, how is it possible for them to give funds to the FUUAST?,” retorted Dr Mukhtar Ahmed, Chairman of the Higher Education Commission.
“So far, the previous Vice-Chancellors at FUUAST have failed to do their job. They refused to listen to anyone including the Chancellor’s office and invested in upgradations and appointments at their own will, which cost superfluous amounts of money. This problem is not a one-day issue, since a more competent administration is the need of the hour,” he added.
While it remains to be seen whether or not a new administration would be able to save FUUAST, any of the five academicians chosen by the search committee to assume leadership of the university as Vice-Chancellor, would be expected to face significant obstacles in trying to save this failing institution given the current abysmal state of its financial affairs.

9,MQM-P man shot dead in front of wife,"Police are investigating the incident, exploring all possible angles, including robbery resistance","Muhammad Rehan, a 35-year-old activist of Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), was fatally shot in front of his wife at his in-laws' residence in Shah Faisal Colony on Sunday. 
Rehan, a father of two, had come to visit his wife's aunt. The motive behind the fatal gun attack, whether related to robbery or another cause, remains unknown.
Preliminary reports suggest that Rehan, a joint in-charge of UC-3 in MQM-P Surjani Town Sector, was outside his wife's aunt's house when two assailants on a motorcycle approached. 
Reacting quickly, Rehan pushed his wife indoors, only to be met with gunfire moments later, leaving him critically wounded on the road.
As news of the incident broke, Sheikh Abdullah, a newly elected member of the Sindh Assembly from MQM, arrived at Jinnah Hospital. He described Rehan as a responsible worker of MQM-Pakistan. The grieving wife said that the attackers, without any apparent motive, opened fire on Rehan, leaving him critically injured.
Sheikh Abdullah added that another shooting incident had occurred in Surjani Town, targeting an estate agency. The injured in that incident happens to be the father of a prominent MQM-P member.
Police are investigating the incident, exploring all possible angles, including robbery resistance. 
Surveillance footage from CCTV cameras along the escape routes is currently being examined by investigators to identify the culprits.
