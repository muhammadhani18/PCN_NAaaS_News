0,Maryam vows to protect bureaucrats,PML-N accuses PTI of 'inciting hate' against govt officers,"Maryam Nawaz, the PML-N’s chief organiser and nominee for the Punjab chief minister’s slot, on Sunday warned that legal action would be taken against those who were inciting the bureaucracy to break the law – indirectly referring to the PTI.
Maryam, the PML-N’s senior vice president and daughter of its supremo Nawaz Sharif, wrote on social media platform X that threatening the bureaucracy meant creating chaos in the state system, and an open indulgence in this practice was an invitation to disaster.
Addressing the bureaucracy, Maryam said officers should not be intimidated by threats and perform their duties according to the law.
The PML-N leader continued that those who threatened the security of the officers would be dealt with “iron hands”.
She vowed to ensure the security of the officers.
In related development, PML-N leader Malik Ahmad Khan accused the PTI of inciting hate against government officers and urged the interim government to take action against the party.
Addressing a news conference in Lahore, accompanied by party leaders Ataullah Tarar and Uzma Bukhari, Malik Ahmad said Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha, who had tendered his resignation a day earlier after alleging that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa were involved in “rigging” the recent general elections, was never a party to the polls process to begin with.
He added that the Rawalpindi commissioner was neither a returning officer (RO), nor a district returning officer (DRO) and had nothing to do with the electoral process.
In fact, he pointed out that the Rawalpindi commissioner did not even hold a post in the ECP.
He claimed that among all this, a dangerous campaign had been kicked off where the photos of various DROs and their families were shared on social media.
“Hate is being incited in a way that is a threat to their lives,” he continued.
It is pertinent to mention that the ECP and CJP Isa have both denied the Rawalpindi commissioner’s claim.
Separately, PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique underscored the imperative need for the party to reflect on its missteps and set them right, suggesting it to take a leaf out of PTI founding chairman Imran Khan's book for impactful use of the social media.
Addressing party activists in Lahore, Rafique maintained that there was no complaint with the chief election commissioner, but injustice was done to his constituency.
“My constituency was divided into pieces during the elections.”
Praising the PTI’s social media team, the PML-N leader said the former premier had the power of a strong digital media presence and reiterated that “our party should identify mistakes and rectify them”.
“The Imran project was prepared in 2010, and the seeds of hatred were sown. It should be clear who sowed those seeds of hatred and efforts are being made to weaken Pakistan from abroad,” he claimed.
“How will anyone accept the elections in this atmosphere of bitterness?”
He asked if his party had emerged victorious in Punjab, had no rigging taken place in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan.
The PML-N leader further said after years, a CJP had arrived who ""does not believe in the doctrine of necessity"".
“Imran Khan wants to keep the chief justice and army chief in his pocket. I ask Imran to identify where the mistakes are. He [Imran] will have to give up the politics of hate.”
The PML-N leader feared that if one did not give way to another, this “fragile” democracy would have its “last chance”.

1,'X' faces 24-hour restriction amid political turmoil,The disruption marks the lengthiest glitch in the series of recent countrywide internet outages,"The popular microblogging site ‘X’, formerly known as Twitter, once again found itself in the crosshairs of restrictions lasting 24 hours in Pakistan, according to reports by NetBlocks on Sunday.
Users nationwide grappled with prolonged inaccessibility to the platform, marking yet another glitch in internet instability in the weeks leading up to, during, and after the hotly-contested February 8 national elections.
The social media platform became elusive for hundreds of users, facing intermittent issues for the second time in a day, with difficulties reported since Saturday.
According to NetBlocks, the metrics indicated that X/Twitter had been restricted in Pakistan for a continuous 24 hours, marking the lengthiest episode in a series of countrywide internet outages.
Earlier, Downdetector highlighted at least 16 reports of potential issues on X across the country around 4:45 pm, a number that escalated to 83 at a certain point. Real-time internet and social media outage monitoring services revealed that users attempting to access X were greeted with a disheartening message – ""this site can't be reached.""
Frustrated netizens voiced complaints about their inability to connect to X for hours on Saturday night.A day earlier Netblocks reported a nationwide disruption to X “amid escalating unrest and protests over allegations of election fraud, following a high-level resignation and public admission of vote manipulation by a senior election official”.
Moreover, the disruptions extended beyond X, with disruptions reported on other major platforms including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, and Google services, along with the internet service provider PTCL, last month.
The development followed Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chatha's accusation against the Election Commission of Pakistan and Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa of engaging in 'rigging,' a charge refuted by both the electoral watchdog and the Chief Justice.

2,PTI calls for judicial probe into rigging charges,"Omar Ayub affirms PTI’s goal to form government at centre, priority to dismiss cases against Imran and others"," 
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) aims to establish its governments at the Centre and in provinces, with top priorities focusing on the dismissal of false cases against senior leaders, including the party's founding chairman, Imran Khan, stated Omar Ayub, the party’s pick for premiership, on Sunday.
At a press conference, Omar, the acting secretary-general of the PTI, along with Acting Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Spokesperson Raoof Hasan, vehemently condemned the alleged rigging in the election results. They demanded a judicial probe into the allegations levelled by the Rawalpindi commissioner.
Ayub announced plans to establish PTI governments both at the federal and provincial levels. Omar reiterated the party's capability to assume governance at both tiers. He pledged to prioritize the dismissal of false cases against PTI’s leaders and workers upon assuming office, including those against Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, and Pervaiz Elahi. “As soon as Imran Khan is released, he will assume the position of prime minister. The premiership is an entrusted responsibility to Imran Khan.”
Omar hailed the PTI's triumph despite obstacles such as the loss of its signature ‘bat’ symbol and the incarceration of its top leaders and activists, and called for honouring people’s voice and restoring the PTI's rightful mandate given to it on February 8.
“We unequivocally denounce the extensive electoral tampering in the recent polls and term it as ‘mother of all riggings’,” he said, highlighting a pervasive lack of trust even among beneficiaries of the rigged elections, including Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).
Echoing Omar's remarks, Barrister Gohar maintained that the PTI secured 180 seats in the National Assembly in the February 8 vote, only to face alleged rigging during the issuance of election results by the returning officers on Form 47. He demanded the announcement of results as per Form 45.
Accusing the authorities of “deliberately delaying provincial election results” to undermine the PTI majority, Gohar called for formation of a judicial commission to probe into election manipulation charges. He urged transparency in the investigation process and public disclosure of its findings.
Referring to Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Chattha’s resignation after admitting election rigging, the PTI leaders demanded the formation of an empowered judicial commission to investigate the allegations and punish the characters involved in the historic electoral heist.
When asked about a petition in the Supreme Court seeking annulment of the elections and re-polling in the country, Ayub stated that since Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa had been named by the commissioner, his party would request that he should not sit on the bench hearing the case.
He explained that the PTI was not demanding the annulment of the general elections rather it wanted that the real mandate be recognised, adding that the results of the February 8 polls should reflect the actual votes cast by the people.
Alliance talks
The PTI leaders did not say which parties they would take as allies to form the government, however, they had previously said that the Majlis-e-Wahdat Muslimeen Pakistan (MWMP) and the Jamat-e-Islami (JI) would be taken onboard.
In this regard talks were held on Sunday with the MWMP but both sides could not finalise their alliance. According to sources, the PTI would now form an alliance with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which was present in the talks between the PTI and MWMP.
The talks at the MWMP Central Secretariat in Islamabad were attended by PTI’s Barrister Gohar and Omar Ayub, and MWMP Chairman Raja Nasir Abbas, Vice Chairman Ahmad Iqbal Rizvi, Secretary General Nasir Abbas Shirazi, Political Secretary Asad Abbas Naqvi.
Others who were present in the meeting were Opposition Leader in Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly Kazim Maysam, Gilgit-Baltistan President Agha Syed Ali Rizvi, Malik Iqrar Hussain and Asif Raza. Besides Sahibzada Hamid Raza, the head of the SIC, also attended the meeting.
Raza said that matters had been finalised between the SIC and the PTI in Punjab and Sindh. “Our services are also available at the Centre and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, he said.
“I stand firmly with the PTI founder and we will support them at every platform,” he added.

3,PML-N wary of flying solo in govt spotlight,Kaira says constitutional positions are up for debate in committees,"Former planning minister Ahsan Iqbal has stressed the need for the PPP to jump on board the coalition government bandwagon and share the load as the PML-N does not want to be left holding the bag.
PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira, on the other hand, mentioned that the committee was currently discussing our proposal to allocate constitutional positions to PPP. The majority of decisions have already been made, leaving no room for further deliberation.
Against the backdrop of reports indicating that PML-N and PPP have been apprised of the consequences of shilly-shallying about government formation by the establishment, both sides seem reluctant to budge from their positions.
However, leaders from both sides appear optimistic about reaching an amicable resolution, asserting that there is no fundamental disagreement between the two parties.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Ahsan Iqbal, while reflecting on his party’s concern, said PML-N was reluctant to shoulder the entire burden of decision-making at the central government level.’Ahsan pinpointed that the crux of the matter in the coordination committee revolved around the shared responsibility dilemma, adding that they are not willing to let others merely be spectators on the treasury benches.
The PML-N wants the PPP to take the reins of ministries and actively participate in the governmental affairs, he added.
He further underscored that without the PPP's presence or a prior understanding of how to tackle the day-to-day affairs of the state, steering the government ship would be a daunting challenge through and through.
When pressed about whether the PML-N is having second thoughts about its decision to lead the government, Iqbal did not provide a clear answer and asked to wait for the outcome of the meeting.
He said will PPP want to lead in government if PML-N offered to switch sides with them which meant PMLN would get a constitutional position and the PPP would get the government.
However, when questioned about PPP leading the government independently with the same terms, he switched gears, arguing that it wouldn't make sense for the third-largest party to spearhead the country.
Furthermore, he asserted that the leadership mantle must be taken up by either PML-N or PTI-backed candidates, adding that the PTI's support lacks the numerical strength “so it was up to them to save this setup.Regarding why was PML-N bothered about what PTI was doing, and why was it concerned about PTI having the required number, he said PML-N could not let this system collapse.
When asked about whether the PML-N was prepared or hesitant to extend the offer for the speaker position, he responded that this would be a mutual decision based on determining the allocation of constitutional portfolios.
PPP’s ministries
Senior PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira clarified that the issue of PPP not accepting any ministries has been settled, with the focus now on constitutional positions and other related matters.
He vehemently refuted media reports suggesting that the PPP was demanding ministries in Punjab.
Kaira shared that the PPP has even declined an offer to hold the prime ministership for half the term, highlighting its commitment to sacrificing for the sake of democracy.
Responding to PML-N's concerns about PPP potentially abandoning them midstream, he pointed out that it was PML-N's decision to form their government and have their prime minister.
When asked if PPP's participation in the government was entirely ruled out and beyond the committee's purview, Kaira stated that the committee's discussions could not be disclosed to the public.
‘Pressure on PPP’
A PPP leader, speaking anonymously to The Express Tribune, acknowledged that the party was facing considerable pressure to agree to the proposed arrangement by PML-N.
The source expressed suspicions that PML-N might be leveraging its influence through the establishment to coerce PPP into joining the government.
Asserting PPP's resilience in the face of this pressure, the leader noted that the party is unlikely to back down in this high-stakes negotiation. He said that apart from the visible advantage of insulating itself from any potential fallout of a government’s decision-making, there was another advantage that might come PPP’s way and that was an offer to make their own prime minister.
He said that their leader might have said in public that they didn’t want the premiership, but if this opportunity presented itself, their leadership were unlikely to let it slide.

4,Political instability can mar IMF programme: Fitch,Says new deal to succeed SBA expiring in March key to country’s credit profile,"The international credit rating agency Fitch has warned that the close outcome of the Feb 8 general elections and resulting near-term political uncertainty may complicate efforts to secure a financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
“This looks set to be a coalition of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the Pakistan Peoples Party, despite the strong performance by candidates associated with Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in the elections,” the credit rating agency said in its report on Pakistan’s economy released on Monday.
The report stated that a new IMF deal, to succeed the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) expiring in March 2024, was key to the country’s credit profile.
“We assume one will be achieved within a few months, but an extended negotiation or failure to secure it would increase external liquidity stress and raise the probability of default.”
It noted that while Pakistan’s external position had improved in recent months, with the State Bank of Pakistan reporting net foreign reserves of $8 billion as of Feb 9, 2024, up from a low of $2.9 billion on Feb 3, 2023, “nevertheless, this is low relative to projected external funding needs, which we expect will continue to exceed reserves for at least the next few years”.
“We estimate Pakistan met less than half of its $18 billion funding plan in the first two quarters of the fiscal year ending June 2024 (FY24), excluding routine rollovers of bilateral debt.”

It added that the “sovereign’s vulnerable external position means that securing financing from multilateral and bilateral partners will be one of the most urgent issues on the agenda for the next government”.
“Negotiating a successor deal to the SBA and adhering to the policy commitments under it will be critical to most other external financing flows, not just from the IMF, and will strongly influence the country’s economic trajectory in the longer term.”
Fitch highlighted that finalising a new IMF deal was likely to be challenging. “The current SBA is an interim package and we believe any successor arrangement would come with tougher conditions, which may be resisted by entrenched vested interests in Pakistan.”
Als read: How bad is country’s debt crisis and can the IMF save it?
Nonetheless, it added, “we assume any resistance will be overcome, given the acute nature of the country’s economic challenges and the limited alternatives”.
It warned that if the political instability continued, discussions with the IMF would be prolonged, assistance from other multilateral and bilateral partners delayed, or implementation of reforms hampered.
“We believe a government will assume office and engage with the IMF relatively quickly, but risks to political stability are likely to remain high.”
The report also warned that public discontent could rise further if the PTI remained sidelined as the election revealed continued strong public support for the party.
It highlighted the government’s “poor record” of completing the IMF programmes, saying that less than half of its 24 IMF programmes had disbursed more than 75% of the funding available.

“However, there has been fair progress on targets under the current SBA. Moreover, we perceive there is stronger consensus within Pakistan on the need for reform, which could facilitate the implementation of a successor arrangement.”
It further warned that policy risks could rise again over time if external liquidity pressures eased, either as a result of initial reform successes or developments outside Pakistan, such as a substantial drop in oil prices.
“This could lead to the renewed build-up of economic and external imbalances. We believe Pakistan’s external finances will remain structurally weak until and unless it develops a private sector that can generate greater significantly more export income, attract FDI or reduce import dependence.”

5,President warns of political void in country,Alvi says ‘competent people’ being ousted from this arena,"President Dr Arif Alvi has expressed his regret over the expulsion of “competent people” from politics, saying that it is imperative to uphold respect for public mandate and ensure political inclusion.
Alvi warned that it would not be in the country's interest if the confidence of the youth in the system was shaken.
Addressing the third edition of Hosting Business Net 2024 on Monday, the president highlighted the integral link between financial inclusion and political participation.
""Financial inclusion is unattainable without the political engagement of the populace,” Alvi remarked, commending the confidence exhibited by millions of young voters in the democratic process.
Emphasising the importance of respecting mandates, the president attributed the closure of social media websites in Pakistan to a deficiency in intellectual capacity to handle criticism.

""It is regrettable that competent people are being ousted from the political arena,” he lamented.
The president called for enhancing the inclusion of deprived sections of society, especially women and persons with disabilities, in the mainstream of the economy through digital transformation of the financial sector for socioeconomic development.
The ceremony was attended by members of the business and diplomatic community.
The president said that the Pakistani people were a vibrant nation that had been blessed with abundant natural resources, adding that the country needed to invest in their intellectual development and capacity building.
He also highlighted that Pakistan could not progress without the inclusion of 26.2 million out-of-school children in the education system.
“Educating such a large portion of the population would require thousands of new schools and additional resources,” he observed. “If left unaddressed, Pakistan would export raw labour without any value-addition.”

The president cited the example of China which had lifted millions of its people out of poverty by investing in their education and health.
He said that financial inclusion was not possible without the political inclusion of the people.
He opined that technology should be utilised for internet voting (i-voting) and Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).
Dr Alvi highlighted the need for setting priorities for the country, making good decisions and efficiently utilising its human resources for the progress of the country.
He said that the low tax-to-GDP ratio was a perennial problem in Pakistan, adding that overcoming this issue would help reduce Pakistan’s reliance on foreign loans.
The president said that banks were offering business loans for women on easy terms and conditions, however, there was a lack of awareness about micro-credit facilities for women.
He urged the banks to enhance their outreach by introducing cashless banking in far-flung areas through customised products and services.
