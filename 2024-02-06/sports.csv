PU students from the Indian Occupied Kashmir and Azad Jammu and Kashmir were also present on the occasion.
Dr Mahmood said, ""The sacrifices of Kashmiris are eternal and we pay homage to them."" He said India had always given a negative message about Kashmiris through its films, to counter which students should learn the skills of film making and script writing. ""Our thoughts, way of living and dealings separate us from the non-Muslims but many forces are working to erase this difference,"" he added.
He said the oppression of Muslims in Occupied Kashmir, Ayudhiya and Delhi under the Modi government had exposed the hidden face of India to the world. Indian Prime Minister Modi's atrocities towards minorities have once again proven the truthfulness of the two-nation theory, he said. 
""Like Syed Ali Geelani, Afzal Guru and Burhan Wani, we should keep the yearning for freedom alive in ourselves,"" he added.

College of Pharmacy’s Principal Dr Syed Atif Raza said the Pakistani nation is with the Kashmiri people on the moral, legal, political and diplomatic fronts.

5,Pre-poll construction projects fuel cynicism,Uzma Bukhari denied the claims that PML-N was the only party invested in such pre-election endeavors,"Even though the regular reconstruction or renovation of public infrastructure is wholly welcomed by the local populace of any locality, the pre-election overt involvement of mainstream political parties in the completion of development projects worth billions of rupees in their constituencies, qualifies to be taken with a pinch of salt.
With the General Elections 2024 just a day away, ample media coverage has focused on highlighting the campaigning efforts made by political parties, be it through their rallies or social media presence however, very little attention has been drawn to a fairly unobtrusive yet observable manifestation of the urge of contesting candidates to appeal to a maximum number of voters; the initiation of several development projects by mainstream parties in their respective constituencies ahead of the elections.
While an optimistic outlook might allow this to pass as a matter of pure coincidence, fundamental philosophical principles governing the human self-interest theory alongside live testaments from members of other political parties indicate that this might not, in fact, be the case.
“In my constituency, there were complaints on the supply of gas and the roads were also dilapidated. Within a month, my opponent candidate from the Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N) started resolving the issues of the locals. 
This is pre-poll rigging and it is a murder of justice,” lambasted a candidate contesting for a seat in the National Assembly with a wicket sign, who further questioned the caretaker government’s decision to release development funds worth billions of rupees per seat to the candidates of PML-N, who were already at a clear advantage.
On the other hand, Uzma Bukhari, the Information Secretary of the PML-N denied the claims that PML-N was the only party invested in such pre-election endeavors.

“This has been an on-going trend since several years where most political parties kick start development activities as part of their election campaign,” maintained Bukhari.
Bukhari’s assertion was confirmed by the candidate of a political party contesting for a National Assembly seat from Lahore. “All candidates including me have received development funds worth more than Rs5 billion, which we have invested in our respective constituencies. We have repaired the roads, improved the sewage system and implemented clean water supply projects in our constituencies,” asserted the candidate, on the condition of anonymity.
According to sources privy to The Express Tribune, despite the restrictions placed by the Election Commission of Pakistan on pre-election development work in constituencies, a sum total of Rs300 billion have been spent on so-called development endeavors by political parties across 19 mega and small cities in Punjab during the past one year, involving the construction and renovation of overhead bridges, underpasses, sewage facilities, clean water reservoirs, educational institutions, hospitals, and police stations in their constituencies.
In his defense, a representative of the Punjab Finance Department assured that only the development funds allocated in the budget had been released. “Now, whether those funds have been used for political purposes or for development projects, we cannot say,” he added.
Speaking to The Express Tribune on the matter, the spokesperson for the Election Commission of Punjab said, “The ECP only takes action against pre-election development works in the constituencies where a candidate officially files a complaint. So far, we have received very few complaints. But the ones that we did receive have been addressed and the development works have been halted.”
