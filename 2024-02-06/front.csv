0,Nawaz smells a rat in SC judge’s abrupt resignation,Criticises ex-premier Imran Khan for not fulfilling promises,"PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Monday further stirred the pot on Monday by terming the sudden resignation of Justice Ijazul Ahsan as the next chief justice, just eight months away from the coveted position, as nothing short of ""fishy.""
The former premier, who is basking in a series of acquittals in the corruption cases against him following a triumphant return from a four-year self-exile in London, hinted that “there was more to the story”.
This is not the first time Nawaz has taken aim at the former Supreme Court judge. During an earlier campaign trail in Lahore, he had raised eyebrows by questioning the timing of the judge’s resignation, saying “A guilty conscience needs no accuser.”
Addressing a public gathering at Murree's GPO Chowk on Monday, the former premier said the judge who ""disqualified me in 2018 is himself disqualified now"".
Ahsan, who held the position of the third most senior judge in the top court and was poised to assume the role of chief justice following the retirement of the current Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, tendered his resignation on January 11.
Ahsan had been assigned by former Chief Justice Saqib Nisar in 2017 to supervise the proceedings related to the references mandated by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against Nawaz Sharif and his family members.
As he has secured acquittals in the corruption cases against him, within months of his coming back to Pakistan after ending a four-year self-exile in London, Nawaz also expressed regret on Pakistan's condition following his disqualification and departure after his conviction.
“When I was the prime minister, I was serving the country, I ended load shedding, made electricity cheaper, ended inflation, built motorways, bread was for Rs4, flour, sugar, cooking oil and vegetables were cheap. The prices of the dollar and petrol were also low, the prices of tractors, fertilisers, cars and motorcycles were all affordable,” he said.
“When everything was going well, why did you expel me?"" he asked as he addressed party supporters.
Taking a jibe at PTI founder and ex-prime minister Imran Khan, Nawaz said “Who was brought in my place, after I was removed?”
He criticised Imran for promising one million homes and a billion tree project but never fulfilling the promises. Nawaz claimed a billion was spent on the scheme but the nation never saw the completion of the Billion Tree project.

“Did anyone find a job or a house? They say that the youth of Pakistan is with them, but the real youth and the real nation are with me,” claimed the PML-N supremo.
Promising infrastructure development in Murree, he said he also wishes for a train service between Rawalpindi and hill station.
Referring to Kashmir, Nawaz said that Pakistan has always stood with its oppressed Kashmiri brethren and will continue to do so under all circumstances.
'Support Lion to resolve crises'
Meanwhile, addressing a political rally in Murree, the former premier’s daughter and PML-N’s senior vice president Maryam Nawaz rallied supporters and vowed the ""highest development"" for the picturesque city if the party secures victory in the upcoming elections.
She said, ""[We] promise the highest development in Murree if the city chooses lion,"" referring to the PML-N's symbolic electoral symbol.The commitment aligns with the overarching theme of several major political parties, including the PML-N, whose election campaigns focus on addressing dire economic indicators fuelled by a weakening local currency, diminishing foreign exchange reserves, and other pressing factors.
Reaffirming the party's electoral promises outlined in the manifesto titled ""Pakistan ko Nawaz do"" (Give Pakistan to Nawaz), Maryam stressed the need to decide the future for the next generations. The seasoned politician, leading the PML-N's election campaign and contesting for the first time in the general election from NA-119 and PP-159 constituencies, highlighted the pivotal role Murree would play in shaping the nation's destiny.
Maryam Nawaz reiterated the party’s aims, including reducing electricity bills by 20-30%, achieving a 6% GDP growth, targeting $60 billion in exports, securing $40 billion in remittances, and decreasing the poverty level from 38% to 25% over the next five years.Encouraging the crowd to support the ‘lion’, Maryam urged voters to trust the party to solve their problems.
Expressing surprise at the large gathering despite harsh weather conditions, she pledged to address the concerns of Murree's residents, particularly targeting the timber and possession mafias plaguing the city.""We had decided to ease the difficulties of Murree's people by serving them day and night,"" Maryam asserted, outlining the party's commitment to bringing positive change to the region.

1,Bilawal says Nawaz won’t last 6 months,"Warns against vote tampering; vows unity, relief","Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari concluded his election campaign with a fiery speech in his hometown of Larkana, issuing stern warnings against vote tampering and launching veiled attacks on his political adversaries.
Addressing a charged crowd, Bilawal refrained from directly naming his rivals but offered a biting critique, singling out former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and referencing past controversies surrounding his ousting from office.With conviction, Bilawal asserted that should Sharif return to power for a fourth term, his tenure would likely be short-lived.
""If elected for a fourth term, within six months, he will face removal,"" Bilawal boldly stated, hinting at the instability that could characterize Sharif's potential leadership.
In addition to warning against the dangers of vote tampering, Bilawal issued a stern caution that any attempts to manipulate election results would provoke a robust response from the PPP. ""They will forget Imran Khan if our votes are tampered with,"" he proclaimed, suggesting that his party would not hesitate to challenge any perceived electoral interference.
The rally at the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Municipal Stadium in Larkana concluded the PPP’s election campaign for February 8 elections, which took Bilawal to all the provinces of the country, including several stops in Punjab, which offers more than half of the National Assembly seats.
Bilwal, who is the PPP candidate for the premiership should the party win the elections, set two immediate goals – uniting the country and providing relief to the masses. He claimed that only the PPP was capable of steering the country out of this difficult situation.
“Today, I have returned to my home after campaigning and touring the whole country,” he started his speech. It’s been a long time no one from Larkana has become the prime minister. When the people of Larkana elected prime minister, entire country developed. So, now it is Larkana’s turn,” he said.
“If you want to get out of the current crises, want economic stability and resolution of the problems, neither the Muslim League [PML-N] nor the PTI [Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf] can do this. Only PPP can do this,” Bilawal told the crowd.
“Look at all the other political parties participating in the elections, they have become a thing of the past, playing their last innings. The old politicians, who are still in politics, know nothing but the politics of hate and division. They are endangering the country with their politics,” he charged.
With their stubbornness and ego, these old politicians have damaged Pakistan’s democracy, economy and the federation. If any of them gets the government again, they will start the politics of sit-ins the next day. They say something else before elections and do something else afterwards,” he continued.
He warned of the repeat of same old politics of hate and vendetta if rivals won the elections. He said that those who turned politics into personal enmity, wanted to sit in the prime minister’s chair for the fourth time to do what they had been doing previously.
“I am saying today, that if one of them wins, then instead of serving the people, they would start sit-ins the next day and take political revenge again. We have seen this movie three times and know what will happen the fourth time. Within six months, the same cry will start, why did you remove me?”
The PPP chief said that those who played with the country’s economy did not realise the difficulties of the masses. “These people have given nothing to the people in their manifestos. They are not worried about inflation, unemployment and poverty but they are worried about power,” he continued.
He added that a PPP government would do two things immediately after assuming power. “One is to end the politics of hate and division, as Pakistan should be united, not divided. The second task is to give relief to the people through the Public Charter of Economy [the PPP’s election manifesto],” he stressed.
Bilawal said that he had travelled all over the country while on the campaign trail. He predicted that Nawaz Sharif would lose the election from the NA-15 Mansehra in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. On the other hand, he added, he would win his seat from Lahore, the home of the Sharifs.
However, he added, regardless of the result, if the election were held transparently, the PPP would want this country to move forward to stability and development. “If my vote was stolen, I know who you are, I will come after you and then you will forget Imran Khan,” he warned.
Earlier, Bilawal praised the people of Larkana for remaining loyal supporter of the PPP and the Bhutto family. “I am grateful to the people of Larkana, the loyalty they have shown to me and my family and my party has made world history.”

2,"Campaigning ends, govt remains non-committal to ‘smooth’ internet functioning",Interior minister says any such action would only be taken upon a request from a province or district.,"As the nation prepares for the general election on Thursday (tomorrow), the government remains non-committal to ensuring the smooth functioning of the internet – a platform which the embattled Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is relying as a last resort to sway its voters and voice its concerns.
In response to the government’s move, the Amnesty International (AI), and several other human rights organisations, issued a call to the authorities, urging them to guarantee uninterrupted access to the internet and digital communication platforms for all citizens across the country during the upcoming elections.
Internet services have been affected thrice in the past two months. The first time on December 17, second on January 7 and the latest one on January 20. The suspensions coincided with the PTI’s virtual events.
The interim government attributed the internet outages across the country to “technical issues”, stating that there was no assurance that such incidents would not recur in the future.
On January 24, the Sindh High Court (SHC) restrained the relevant authorities from suspending internet services till the general elections.
The SHC ordered the caretaker federal government and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to ensure uninterrupted internet services till the polling day.
The order came on a petition filed by human rights defender and lawyer Jibran Nasir, who was contesting the polls for PS-110 as an independent candidate, against the frequent “unconstitutional” internet outages in the country in recent days.
Recently, the PTI moved the Supreme Court, urging it to take notice of the disruption of popular social media platforms including X, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
Addressing a news conference in the federal capital on Tuesday, interim Interior Minister Goher Ejaz dispelled rumours surrounding the elections on Feb 8, saying until now the authorities had not received any directives to shut down the internet services on the day.
He added that any such action would only be taken upon a request from a province or a district.
“As of now, no decision has been made to shut down mobile or internet services. However, if necessary, considerations are made based on security requests from specific districts or provinces [internet and mobile service will be suspended],” he remarked.
The interior minister was flanked by Caretaker Information Minister Murtaza Solangi and Interior Secretary Aftab Akbar Durrani.
Expressing his commitment to ensuring security, the minister stressed that no compromise would be tolerated on maintaining law and order during the elections.
He underscored the collaboration between security agencies and the administration to prevent any unlawful interference.
He highlighted the presence of trained commandos in Balochistan and the support of the armed forces in ensuring the safety of the electoral process.
Providing an overview of the election preparations, the interior minister shared that out of 90,777 polling stations across the country, 44,000 were declared normal, 29,985 deemed sensitive, and 16,766 had been labelled as highly sensitive.
He urged the nation to vote ‘honestly’ on Feb 8, and added that the country’s reputed media had a significant role to play as it enjoyed the trust of 250 million people.
He said seven to eight security personnel would be deployed at each polling station, along with CCTV cameras installed at those declared sensitive. He added that thousands of police personnel will be deployed across the nation to ensure security on election day.
“All the CCTV cameras have been installed by us, we have 90,777 polling stations, 40,000 polling stations are normal but security is also deployed here. more than 16,000 polling stations are highly sensitive, while the federal government has marked 135 polling stations as sensitive,” the minister said.
Speaking on the occasion, interim information minister noted that the government had no directives yet to suspend mobile and internet services on election day.
Emphasising the gravity of the security situation, Solangi maintained that no such orders had been passed yet, while underscoring the authority of local administrations to assess security conditions and make decisions accordingly, particularly in areas experiencing a deterioration in security.
Solangi revealed that the information ministry had taken steps to facilitate local and foreign journalists and observers. An online helpline had been established to provide assistance and support to media professionals and observers, he said.
Furthermore, the minister acknowledged that while extraordinary situations necessitated extraordinary solutions, the current circumstances did not warrant such measures.
He drew attention to the proliferation of fake news, and propaganda on social media platforms, highlighting the severity of the security challenges. Despite these challenges, he affirmed that Pakistan remained resolute in its commitment to combat terrorism.
Meanwhile, the AI, in collaboration with other human rights organisations, urged the authorities to ensure uninterrupted access to internet and digital communication during the upcoming polls.
Expressing concern over the potential limitations on internet access, the AI underscored the importance of upholding the right to freedom of expression and ensuring that citizens can freely share and access information online.
In the light of these developments, the rights organisations specifically called upon Prime Minister Anwarul Haq Kakar and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to take proactive measures to guarantee full internet access and social media usage throughout the election period.
The ability to access the internet and utilise social media platforms is vital for citizens to participate in democratic processes, engage in informed discourse, and exercise their fundamental rights, the organisation said.
The AI and its partners emphasised that any disruptions in internet access during the election would not only undermine the democratic process but also impede the ability of citizens to access crucial information and express their viewpoints freely.
Meanwhile, the period for chanting convincing slogans, enticing people with their manifestos, and soliciting votes came to a close as the deadline set by the ECP expired at midnight on Wednesday.
Now, the nation prepares to go to the polls on February 8 (tomorrow).
Though the political parties had initiated their electoral campaign after the announcement of election schedule by the polls supervisory body, a notable surge in their activities was witnessed after they were allotted election symbols on January 13.
Around 111 political parties are set to contest the Feb 8 polls to woo more than 128 million registered voters, while the PTI is out of the fray due to the non-allotment of election symbol.
The PTI’s candidates are contesting as independents.
With much hue and cry over the conformity of holding polls and the incarceration of PTI founding chief, the caretaker government was grappled with a formidable law and order situation during this period.

3,IMF tepid to interim govt proposals,"Lender questions govt haste on PIA, circular debt schemes","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday did not immediately endorse the interim government’s proposals to reduce industrial electricity prices, settle over one-fifth of the circular debt and make the Rs268 billion debt of the Pakistan International Airline (PIA) part of the public debt.
The IMF also asked as to why the interim government is showing haste when the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has already barred it from taking any decisive action on the privatisation of PIA, according to government sources.
The global lender sought more details about the economic and legal viability of the three major proposals. The IMF held two back-to-back virtual meetings but their outcomes were below the expectations of the Pakistani authorities.
The next round of discussions on these proposals would take place after the Pakistani authorities provide additional information and the global lender reviews it internally.
The IMF neither rejected nor accepted the three proposals. It emerged from these two meetings that the IMF would give more serious thoughts to them once an elected government takes charge.
The caretaker government is keen on getting the three proposals implemented before leaving the office.
The meetings took place on the request of Pakistani authorities just three days before the general elections scheduled for this Thursday.
The ECP on Sunday refrained the interim government from taking anything to the federal cabinet related to the PIA privatization and questioned its legal mandate.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Finance, Qamar Abbasi did not respond to a question about the IMF’s response to the proposals and sought more information. The IMF resident representative, Esther Perez, also did not reply.
The sources said the IMF’s main objection to the PIA’s proposed debt settlement plan was about the urgency in taking the PIA debt into the government’s books. The government was claiming that the entity was ripe for privatisation and its future proceeds would be available to pay off the debts but still it wanted to take the Rs268 billion on its books before the end of the caretaker setup.
The IMF wanted further clarity about the likely timing of the PIA privatisation and the minimum reserve price, if any, worked out by now by financial advisors. The sources said the IMF’s query was why not to wait for the PIA privatisation proceeds to settle the debt.
The sources said that there was also a question on the treatment of the PIA’s debt that it owes to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Pakistan State Oil (PSO).
The IMF was informed about the arrangement among the commercial banks and the federal government about the Rs268 billion debt restructuring. The government and commercial banks had agreed on the Rs268 billion debt restructuring plan.
Under the understanding, the government will use the PIA sale proceeds for principal payments, resorting to the budget if insufficient funds are available. Banks, in return, accept a 10-year debt rollover with a 12% annual interest rate, amounting to Rs32.2 billion in annual interest payments.

This arrangement means banks will receive Rs322 billion in interest payments over a decade, exceeding their outstanding stocks of Rs268 billion. The total payout to banks at a 12% interest rate will be Rs572 billion in 10 years.
The total outstanding debt of the airline is Rs825 billion, and the privatization ministry and the PIA have to seek no objection certificates from the CAA and the FBR to file a scheme of arrangement with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).
The PIA owes Rs120 billion to the CAA. The FBR needs to recover Rs19 billion from the PIA.
Tariff Plan
The sources said the IMF also did not give its stamp of approval to the government’s plan of reducing the electricity prices for the industrial sector with effect from April 1. For the IMF, it was like reducing the burden from one shoulder and putting it on another, which is already overburdened.
The plan reduces the cross-subsidy burden of the industrial sector by 91% or Rs222 billion but it increases the subsidy burden on residential consumers using over 400 units by 41% or Rs22 billion.
Pakistani authorities informed the IMF about their plan to reduce industrial tariffs up to 29% by sparing the industrialists from the burden of paying subsidies for the majority of the domestic consumers.
The industrial consumer pays Rs8.61 per unit subsidy, while the residential consumer with consumption above 400 units pays Rs5.88 per unit.
The energy ministry has proposed fixed charges on all types of residential consumers to reduce cross-subsidy for industrial consumers, ranging from as low as Rs50 fixed charge on 50 units monthly consumption, to Rs3,000 per month fixed charges for unprotected residential consumers with monthly consumption ranging from 1 unit to above 700 units.  These changes would lead to an overall effective industrial tariff ranging from 8.5 cents per unit to 11.75 cents per unit.
CD Plan
The IMF also decided to hold a separate meeting with the minister for energy to get further clarity on the Rs1.27 trillion circular debt reduction plan.
The global lender was briefed about the plan to reduce the circular debt by Rs1.27 trillion or 22% through combination of budget subsidies and using the government companies’ dividends.
The total energy sector circular debt stands at Rs5.725 trillion as of November 2023. This includes Rs2.7 trillion power sector debt and over Rs3 trillion gas sector debt.
The IMF wanted to understand the government’s legal obligation in paying the Rs745 billion supplementary grant to settle the circular debt.
The IMF was told that a grant of Rs745 billion was needed for only two days to trigger the entire process. The actual funds that would go back to the kitty in the shape of dividends and taxes would be Rs748 billion, they claimed in the plan submitted to the SIFC.
The gross impact on the budget of the Rs1.27 trillion circular debt plan will come to Rs902 billion.
Of the debt settlement plan of Rs1.27 trillion, it is proposed to retire a little over Rs1 trillion of the gas sector circular debt. The remaining over Rs255 billion will be spent on curtailing the power sector circular debt of Rs2.7 trillion.
Once implemented, the gas sector debt will come down from over Rs3 trillion to Rs2 trillion. The power sector circular debt will drop to Rs2.5 trillion.

4,Balochistan preps for epic electoral Battle Royale,Multiple former CMs contesting and potential alliances have become the hallmarks of upcoming polls in the province,"In just a few days, albeit after much ado, the populace of Balochistan will have their say on who gets to represent them in the provincial and National Assembly.
Despite the pervasive terrorism threat in the province, political parties from various backgrounds, including religious, Baloch, and Pashtun nationalist factions, are actively engaging in the electoral process and are all set for the February 8th showdown.
The province, encompassing a vast geographical area, has witnessed record-breaking participation this time around with 1,729 candidates contesting for 51 Balochistan Assembly seats and 16 National Assembly seats.
This surge in candidates indicates a competitive electoral environment, highlighting the fervour and determination of political entities to secure victory in the upcoming general election and shape the political landscape of Balochistan.

Candidates galore in Quetta
In contrast to previous elections where competition for most National Assembly and provincial assembly seats involved only 2 to 3 candidates each, this time, all 9 provincial assembly seats in Quetta city boast more than 40 candidates each. Notably, in the constituency known as PB-43 Quetta, formerly referred to as PB-1, a staggering 50 candidates are vigorously vying for victory, which is a departure from the earlier dominance between Senator Saeed Ahmed Hashmi, founder of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), and Pakistan People’s Party’s (PPP) Shafeeq Ahmed Khan, on the seat.
Multiple former chief ministers of Balochistan contesting elections
Currently, eight former chief ministers of Balochistan including Nawab Muhammad Aslam Raisani, Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, Mir Quddus Bizenjo, Jam Kamal Khan, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, Mir Jan Muhammad Jamali, and Sardar Saleh Bhootani are contesting elections on provincial and national assembly seats from the province.
Be that as it may, political analysts are of the view that apart from Sardar Saleh Bhootani, who has served as the caretaker chief minister of the province, there seems to be no easy win for all the other former chief ministers of Balochistan, as they are facing tough competition in their respective constituencies.
Electables: Kingmakers or not?
Earlier during campaign season PPP’s Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari spent 3 days in Quetta and met with party supporters and leaders; and also addressed supporters in Khuzdar. Furthermore, the PPP Chairman’s father, former president, Asif Ali Zardari, also visited Turbat and addressed party supporters.
And it seems efforts of both decision makers of the PPP bore fruit as they succeeded in gaining the support of influential electables from Balochistan, including Sardar Sarfaraz Domki, Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, Mir Quddus Bizenjo, and former caretaker federal minister, Sarfaraz Bugti.
In stark contrast with the PPP’s campaigning, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) has not focused as much on Balochistan. This is evidenced by the fact that the party’s supremo Nawaz Sharif, along with former prime minister Shahbaz Sharif, and the party’s senior vice president Maryam Nawaz, only visited Quetta once during the campaign cycle and held meetings with a handful of electables.
However, their efforts seemed to have worked as well as a significant number of electables from the province joined the PML-N after parting ways from BAP, despite being provincial ministers in the former BAP-led provincial government.
Nevertheless, it is pertinent to mention that analysts expect that the PPP’s electables are in a stronger position compared to their political rivals PML-N.

JUI-F and PKMAP cozying up
While only Feb 8 will tell if electables win at all whether it be for the PPP or the PML-N, two electoral heavyweights in the province are all set to take on the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf in Quetta and Pishin.
Maulana Fazl ur Rehman, Chief of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) will face off against former governor of Balochistan, the PTI’s Syed Zahoor Agha; whereas Mahmood Khan Achakzai, Chief of the Pashtoonkhwah Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), will go head-to-head against the PTI’s General Secretary for Balochistan, Salar Khan.
It is pertinent to mention that the PKMAP’s Chief as a goodwill gesture, has withdrawn from NA-265 Pishin and is backing the JUI-F Chief. As a reciprocal, the JUI F, withdrew its candidate Mufti Rozi Khan in support of Mehmood Khan Achakzai on NA-263 Quetta City. It is also worthwhile mentioning that the PKMAP was expecting that the JUI-F would withdraw its candidate Salahuddin Ayub on NA-266 to ensure the victory of Mehmood Khan Achakzai based on cordial relations between the JUI-F and PKMAP’s Chief, and an electoral alliance was expected between the JUI-F and PKMAP in the Pashtoon-dominated areas of Balochistan but that did not happen.

Interesting contests all around
Apart from the JUI-F and PKMAP, the Balochistan National Party (BNP) is also vying for key seats in the province. The BNP’s Chief Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal is contesting elections on 2 national assembly seats from Khuzdar and Quetta and 1 provincial assembly seat from his native town Wadh.
It is worth recalling that the nomination papers of the BNP Chief were initially rejected by the Returning Officers for holding an Iqama. However, the election tribunal of the Balochistan High Court (BHC) later allowed Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal to contest elections. Now the BNP Chief is going to face Mir Shafique Rehman Mengal of the Jhalawan Panel on the provincial assembly seat from Wadh and Nawabzada Jamal Raisani of the PPP on NA-264 Quetta.
Another Balochistan electoral heavyweight, Chairman Senate Sadiq Sanjrani, is contesting elections on PB-32 from Dalbandin Chaghi. Sadiq Sanjrani is all set to face Mir Arif Jan Muhammad Hassani of PPP and Sakhi Amanullah Notezai of the JUI-F; and political analysts expect that the Chairman Senate will face a tough contest.
Similarly, Jam Kamal Khan, the former chief minister of the province, is also facing tough competition from his political rival Wadera Hussain Jamot in Lasbela, who is a PPP candidate and is backed by the influential Bhootani brothers.
Balochistan anticipating yet another coalition government
Be that as it may, political observers expect that Balochistan, which has consistently had a coalition government due to the intricate political landscape preventing any single party from securing a majority in the province since its establishment as a province in the 1970s, will have yet another coalition government.
However, analysts are of the view that as the province grapples with its distinctive sociopolitical dynamics, the formation of coalition governments remains a pragmatic response to accommodate the diverse interests and perspectives that characterise the political landscape of Balochistan.
And once the anticipated coalition government takes charge, political analysts expect that one of former federal caretaker minister for interior, Sarfaraz Bugti, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, Nawabzada Gazeen Marri, Nawab Muhammad Aslam Raisani, Mir Sadiq Sanjrani, and Jam Kamal Khan, will be considered for chief ministerial slot of the Balochistan.
Campaign season marred with terrorism
While only time will tell who eventually gets to be Chief Minister of the province, it is pertinent to mention that Balochistan’s electoral campaign cycle was marred with terrorism. Over a dozen bomb explosions targeting election campaign offices and candidates of political parties temporarily impacted the momentum in Balochistan, which might affect election day turnout as well.
Former provincial president of the PPP, Ali Madad Jattak, former provincial minister, Mir Zahoor Buledi, Agha Shakeel Durrani, and Mir Nooruddin Nowsherwani's residences and election campaign offices were targeted during the campaign cycle; consequently, around 2 dozen people were injured and 8 died.
Given this looming security threat, the Balochistan government has taken several security measures to ensure fair and peaceful elections. Of the 18 districts in Balochistan, 5,067 polling stations are slated for February 8th, with 2,055 out of these identified as highly sensitive, 2,180 as sensitive, and 832 as normal. Furthermore, the provincial government has also decided to install over 8,000 CCTV cameras outside all sensitive polling stations in the province.
