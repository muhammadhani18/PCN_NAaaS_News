0,Quality glitch to delay 737 MAX deliveries,Boeing has to do more work on about 50 undelivered airplanes,"Boeing Co said on Sunday it will have to do more work on about 50 undelivered 737 MAX airplanes, potentially delaying some near-term deliveries, after its supplier Spirit AeroSystems discovered two mis-drilled holes on some fuselages.
Boeing confirmed the findings in response to a Reuters query after industry sources said an “edge margin”, or spacing problem, had been found in holes drilled on a window frame on some jets.
Boeing, which has been under fire from regulators and airlines since the January 5 blowout of a door plug on a 737 MAX 9, said safety was unaffected and existing 737s could keep flying.
“This past Thursday, a supplier notified us of a non-conformance in some 737 fuselages. I want to thank an employee at the supplier who flagged to his manager that two holes may not have been drilled exactly to our requirements,” Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal said in a letter to staff referring to Spirit, which is the sole 737 fuselage supplier.

“While this potential condition is not an immediate flight safety issue and all 737s can continue operating safely, we currently believe we will have to perform rework on about 50 undelivered airplanes,” Deal said in the letter.
Spirit spokesperson Joe Buccino told Reuters that as part of its 360-degree quality management programme, a member of its team identified an issue that did not conform to engineering standards. “We are in close communication with Boeing on this matter,” he said.

1,Business leaders demand urgent action on crumbling roads,Call for master plan as deteriorating infrastructure hinders economic growth,"Karachi’s business leaders have urgently called for the formulation of a comprehensive master plan to address the city’s deteriorating road infrastructure. Recognising the pivotal role of smooth roads in fostering economic growth, these leaders stress the need for a strategic approach to improve transportation efficiency and accessibility.
Well-maintained roads, they argue, are crucial for facilitating the movement of goods and people, reducing transportation costs, and increasing overall productivity. The ripple effect extends to attracting investments, stimulating trade, and enhancing economic activity. Improved connectivity is seen as a catalyst for development in both urban and rural areas, creating a plethora of opportunities for businesses and communities alike.
The business leaders advocate for an approach akin to enterprise diplomacy, where diplomatic skills are employed to navigate the complexities of the global business environment. They stress the importance of building partnerships, resolving conflicts, and addressing regulatory challenges as integral components of economic statecraft.
Chairman of All Karachi Tajir Ittehad (AKTI), Atiq Mir highlights the severe impact of dilapidated road infrastructure on local businesses. Increased transportation costs, supply chain delays, and vehicle damage, he argues, escalate operational expenses for businesses, affecting their competitiveness and profitability. Additionally, unreliable transportation infrastructure deters potential investors and customers, hindering economic activities and potentially leading to a decline in local business growth.
Mir said that revamped road infrastructure could particularly benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by improving transportation efficiency. Reduced transit times and enhanced connectivity enable faster movement of goods, ultimately reducing logistical costs for SMEs. The creation of a more conducive atmosphere for markets to operate and thrive is seen as a direct result of better roads.
The current state of affairs is attributed to a lack of coordination among government departments responsible for road construction, gas lines, sewerage, and water supply. “When the city government was functional, significant progress was lacking. During Waseem Akhtar’s tenure as Karachi mayor, various obstacles impeded his work. However, since Barrister Murtaza Wahab assumed the mayoral role, development efforts continue to be in a state of suspension.
The persistent issues of dishonesty, criminal negligence, and a lack of will within the Sindh government contribute to the deterioration of the city’s roads. Historically, despite receiving substantial grants—amounting to Rs10 billion and Rs20 billion—Karachi has not witnessed visible improvements. The city has become a victim of corruption within local government departments.
A glaring absence of a master plan further exacerbates the situation in Karachi. Departments responsible for road construction or repair operate independently, leading to a lack of coordination. This disjointed approach is evident when one department constructs or repairs a road, only for another to lay gas, sewerage, or water supply lines. The result is dilapidated roads, particularly affecting markets and bazaars.”
Mirza Tariq, a supplier of confectionery and food items, provides firsthand accounts of the poor conditions of key roads in Karachi. He points to specific sections, including Shahjehan Avenue, Water Pump Chowrangi to People’s Chowrangi, and People’s Chowrangi to Sakhi Hassan, as well as sections of Nishter Road, Jehangir Road, and roads in Lyari, Malir, Korangi, and Landhi. Tariq lamented the higher cost of vehicle maintenance compared to transportation costs due to the state of these roads.
Karachi Citizens’ Forum (KCF) Convenor Nargis Rahman said, “The actions of government officials in Karachi can be described as merely cosmetic. The main highways and thoroughfares suffer due to a thin layer of poor construction material, exacerbated by heavy vehicular traffic and a collapsed sewerage system. The investment in road infrastructure is inadequate, leading to substantial losses.
The consequences extend beyond damaged roads, impacting the health and productivity of commuters, including staffers, traders, students, and women. The overall well-being of the public is compromised, resulting in a trust deficit in government services. Despite the evident challenges in road conditions, there is an ironic lack of citizen complaints against the substandard services provided by the government bodies. This situation leaves everyone as a victim of malpractice and contributes to a collective loss.”
Riazuddin, a leading industrialist and former president of the Site Association of Industry (SAI), called for the implementation of a master plan for the entire city. He stressed that the prime responsibility of the Sindh government is to allocate funds for infrastructure, eliminate corruption, improve construction materials, and ensure the functionality of the traffic engineering bureau of the Karachi Development Authority (KDA). He lamented the disproportionate allocation of funds, and alleged that only 30% to 40% are spent on roads while the remainder is pocketed.

Highlighting specific instances, Riazuddin pointed to the main Mangopir Road, reconstructed three years ago, where major chunks are already broken. He attributed the inability of contractors to build roads with proper construction materials to pervasive cuts and kickbacks, leading to compromised quality. He deemed a comprehensive revamping of infrastructure as essential, requiring a redesign of Karachi’s master plan, especially in areas with informal settlements (Katchi abadis).
Leading builder and town planner Hanif Gohar, former chairman of the Association of Builders and Developers of Pakistan (ABAD), underscored the need for honest institutional commitment and merit-based awards for road contracts. He stressed the potential for gradual improvement if institutions work honestly and road contracts are awarded based on merit.
While some road schemes are managed by the Sindh Works and Services Department, the majority fall under the jurisdiction of the Sindh local government and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), with support from other authorities.
A senior official from KMC provided details on the condition of anonymity, stating, “There are approximately 200 Annual Development Programme (ADP) schemes for road infrastructure in Karachi. The KMC has allocated around Rs1,500 million for road-related projects since the significant flood of 2022 up to the present date. However, approximately Rs4,000 million is needed to revamp or repair the dilapidated roads under the jurisdiction of the KMC. The KMC oversees a vast network of 106 main thoroughfares, including Shahrah-e-Faisal, M A Jinnah Road, Shahrah-e-Pakistan, and others.
The inadequate sewerage system and blocked storm drains pose significant challenges, causing damage to roads and impacting various sections of the city's arteries. A proper sewerage system and well-maintained storm drains are essential to safeguard roads from deterioration.""
Another official mentioned that KMC has not received a single instalment of the allocated budget for the fiscal year 2023-2024, which amounts to approximately Rs3.6 billion annually. This budget is distributed into four instalments and provided on a quarterly basis. Despite the delay in budget disbursement, the KMC is utilising its own earnings to fund minor road projects.
Regarding the development schemes for road infrastructure in Karachi, a senior official from the Sindh Works and Service Department stated that there are four categories of schemes. These include four ongoing improvement schemes, one ongoing construction scheme, one new construction scheme, and three pre-stressed bridges. The total approved cost for all nine schemes is Rs3,109.322 million.
A resident of Defence Housing Authority (DHA) Phase-V main Khayaban-e-Bahria expressed concerns, stating, “The gas utility stopped the old line and laid a new line two months back. However, they could not connect the new line to the system. As a result, residents in this affluent area have been dealing with clouds of dust and broken roads for approximately two months due to ongoing work for the installation of gas, telephone, and sewage lines successively.”
Dean Faculty of Architecture and Sciences at NED University of Engineering and Technology, Prof Dr Noman Ahmed called for a comprehensive road condition survey to identify defects and plan a phased rehabilitation programme. He underscored the importance of including rehabilitation projects in budget proposals and developing a strategy for scientific and proper road repairs. Ahmed identified collapsed sewerage systems, poor construction materials, increased vehicular traffic, defective road design, and deteriorating drainage systems as the main issues contributing to poor infrastructure.
As preparations for the next year’s budget loom, Ahmed advocated for a strategy to initiate scientific road repairs, benefiting all Karachiites. Moreover, he said that traffic police play a crucial role in monitoring the diverse dynamics of vehicular traffic situations. Their role extends to informing commuters about traffic information services, providing details about under-construction roads, and suggesting alternative routes to avoid traffic congestion. He pointed out that in foreign countries, traffic police operate an FM channel to keep travellers updated, and a similar pilot channel was previously introduced in the country. He argued the need to popularise such channels again for the benefit of the public.

2,Oil steady following strong jobs report,US pledge to continue air strikes in ME keeps tensions high,"Oil prices were steady on Monday as a strong US job report which curbed sharp falls last week dampened hopes of swift rate cuts, but a US pledge to continue air strikes in the Middle East kept geopolitical tensions high.
Brent crude futures gained 10 cents, or 0.1%, to $77.43 a barrel by 1420 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were flat at $72.28 a barrel.
Both benchmarks ended last week down about 7% after stronger-than-expected US jobs data suggested interest rate cuts could be further out than expected.
Read Oil rises over $1
The report showed job growth accelerating in January and wages up by the most in nearly two years, signs that could complicate interest rates cuts by the US Federal Reserve which financial markets had envisioned could start in May.
The data “pushes the timeline for Fed’s highly anticipated cutting cycle out into the second quarter”, said Jeff Schulze, Head of Economic and Market Strategy at ClearBridge Investments. Meanwhile, progress on ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas appeared elusive, indicating tensions in the oil-producing region are set to linger.

3,PBC against finance ministry's tax policy role,Says fiscal policy be aligned with long-term industrial and trade policies,"Although the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) has openly welcomed the government’s plans to split the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) into two entities, it raises concerns over the proposal of keeping the policy-making department in the Ministry of Finance.
In a letter to Caretaker Minister for Finance and Revenue Dr Shamshad Akhtar, PBC Chief Executive Ehsan Malik wrote “the plans you shared propose to retain the (FBR’s) policy role within the finance ministry. Our concern with this is that (revenue) deficit-bridging measures will continue to influence policies.”
“We, therefore, suggest that the policy role be under the ambit of the Ministry of Planning to align fiscal policy with long-term industrial and trade policies within the framework of five-year plans.”
The separation of fiscal policy from tax collection has been a fundamental element of the council’s advocacy work. In the present structure, which combines the two roles, often knee-jerk, short-term and revenue-seeking changes are made, which undermine investor confidence.
Worse still, these revenue-seeking measures target those that are already disproportionately burdened, thwarting the growth of business and the economy, the letter from the country’s leading business advocacy forum read.
“We also note with concern that the policy board will not have taxpayer representation and that the primary goal of policies will be to raise tax revenues.
“We strongly believe that policies should drive growth of business, from which higher taxes can flow to the exchequer. Thus, wealth creation, capital accumulation, consolidation through formation of groups, investment, employment, exports, import substitution and building resilience to climate change should be drivers of tax policies and goals of the policy board.”
It was of the view that taxpayer representation on the policy board would enrich its output. Taxpayers are important stakeholders that should not be ignored. Furthermore, tax targets should encourage broadening of the tax base instead of merely the total revenue raised.
Earlier this month, Finance Minister Shamshad Akhtar shared plans to deploy artificial intelligence and technology to broaden the tax base. “We stress the need to transform talent to use these effectively.” Akhtar met the business community along with the senior FBR leadership to discuss the revenue board’s restructuring. 
Read Seven keys to good tax policy
In the letter, the PBC proposed 25 measures to collect higher revenue through increasing the number of taxpayers instead of burdening those who are already paying due taxes. The proposals suggest ways to encourage investment, exports and import substitution, among others.
It urged the government to ensure long-term predictability and consistency to promote investment and emphasised that policy changes should not affect those who invest on the basis of a previous policy; to make revenue from new taxpayers the primary target to promote broadening of the tax base; exclude refundable taxes and advance tax when assessing performance against tax collection targets; remove the disproportionate burden of taxes on a few taxpayers, in particular withdraw super tax, which was billed as a one-time tax when imposed; tax policies should support growth and competitiveness of business, and be aligned with long-term industrial policies.
It recommended that taxes and tax processes should be simple, with minimum personal interface and harassment; to encourage listing and formation of groups by eliminating double taxation of inter-company dividends and facilitating surrender of trade losses; and establish clear order of priorities to promote formalisation and governance.
The order of priorities should be like this – listed companies, followed by non-listed/ private companies, then the association of persons and individuals in business. The PBC called for taxing profit, not turnover; ensuring that the formal sector enjoys more favourable taxation than the informal sector; and supporting the National Tariff Policy to deploy tariffs as instrument of trade policy rather than revenue generation.

4,‘Smuggled tyres cause annual losses of over Rs70 billion’,"Tyre dealers call for intervention to protect consumers, boost local industry growth","Tyre dealers and manufacturers have appealed to the government to take stern action against the smuggling of tyres, aiming to improve the competitiveness of the local industry and provide equal business opportunities. They stressed the need to curb the flow of smuggled tyres to protect local customers from substandard or inferior quality products and to promote the local industry.
Sharing views with The Express Tribune, they said the annual consumption of tyres in the country is 14.5 million, with approximately 25% of the demand met by domestic production and 10% imported legally, while the rest is through grey channels.
They estimate that the smuggling of tyres alone costs the national exchequer more than Rs70 billion annually, also severely impacting the local tyre industry. Although there was a visible slowdown last year when the government took action to overcome smuggling for a few months, it seems business as usual for the smugglers now.
Ghandhara Tyre & Rubber Company Limited (GTR) CEO Hussain Kuli Khan expresses concern, stating, “Smuggled tyres of inferior quality and of all sizes are now easily available in the market. Unfortunately, due to their low prices, people are buying them without knowing the repercussions.” Last year, the Collectorate of Customs Enforcement (CCE) confiscated over 55,000 smuggled tyres, mainly larger car tyre sizes worth about Rs540 million in Karachi, indicating the heavy influx of smuggled tyres.
“The government needs to reassess the data on items imported through the Afghan Transit Trade (ATT) and verify whether the quantity of tyres imported aligns with the vehicle population in Afghanistan. Items supposedly under the purview of ATT are either offloaded in Karachi or return from the Afghan border through smuggling, and this issue requires urgent attention,” he lamented.

The local industry, he noted, plays a significant role in providing revenue to the exchequer, along with providing opportunities of employment. GTR alone contributes over Rs3.20 billion annually to the national exchequer. “Approximately 60% to 70% of smuggled tyres flood the local markets, causing harm to the domestic industry and, more critically, dissuading potential investors and industrialists keen on establishing new ventures, which is imperative in the current situation. Tyres for various vehicles, including cars, trucks, tractors, and buses, are illicitly brought in from countries such as China, Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia through the Chaman borders,” said Khurram Mustafa Suriya, a prominent tire dealer from Suriya Motors Karachi.
He explained that customers who opt for smuggled tyres due to lower prices often complain about poor quality after some time. He suggested that government relief and incentives for the local industry could lead to more job generation and increased variety and designs in the local market.
Meanwhile, other dealers pointed out that smuggled tyres often arrive in substandard conditions, exhibiting torn tyre beads and structures, along with tampered dates. Subsequently, smugglers use mechanical tools to rectify the deformed tyres, reducing their operational lifespan and posing risks to public safety.

5,OECD forecasts global GDP growth at 2.9% in 2024,Anticipates moderate growth in US and eurozone,"Global gross domestic product (GDP) growth is projected to ease to 2.9% in 2024 from 3.1% in 2023, before recovering to 3.0% in 2025 as financial conditions ease, according to the outlook released Monday by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Annual GDP growth in the United States would moderate to 2.1% in 2024 and 1.7% in 2025 while it’s expected to remain supported by household spending and strong labour market conditions. Euro area GDP growth is projected to be 0.6% in 2024 and 1.3% in 2025, with activity held back by tight credit conditions in the near term before picking up as real incomes strengthen, the report said.
The OECD also reported global growth proved resilient in 2023, with inflation declining more quickly than anticipated; inflation was projected to be back to target in most G20 countries by the end of 2025.
“Headline inflation in the G20 economies is projected to drop from 6.6% in 2024 to 3.8% in 2025, with core inflation in the G20 advanced economies easing to 2.5% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025,” the organisation added.

According to the report, high geopolitical tensions are a significant near-term risk to activity and inflation, particularly if the conflict in the Middle East were to disrupt energy markets.
Persisting service price pressures could also generate upside inflation surprises and trigger financial market repricing as expectations of monetary policy easing are reassessed.
“The foundations for future growth need to be strengthened by policy reforms,” the report said, adding that enhanced international cooperation was needed to revive global trade, ensure faster and better coordinated progress towards decarbonisation, and alleviate debt burdens in lower-income countries.

6,Farmers await imported urea supply,Govt fails to finalise mechanism for delivery of urea as dealers fleece growers,"The failure of caretaker administration to finalise a mechanism for urea delivery to farmers is leading to a multibillion-rupee scandal, resulting in the plunder of money by fertiliser dealers.
Already, the government has imported 220,000 tons of urea costing nearly Rs30 billion, which was sent to National Fertiliser Marketing Limited (NFML) warehouses on December 25 last year.
However, the imported urea has not yet reached farmers, who were supposed to receive supplies for planting the current wheat crop.
Now, the food security ministry is expecting the delivery of imported urea to farmers either by the end of February or March, which will available to them in May for next crop cultivation.
Earlier, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) had decided that fertiliser manufacturers would lift stocks of imported urea from NFML storages to provide it to farmers at the basket price. However, the mechanism has not yet been finalised and the commodity is still stuck at NFML warehouses.
The imported urea was meant to be provided to farmers and released in the market to push down its prices. However, the farmers were either denied the provision of urea due to its scarcity or they got it at double the actual price at more than Rs6,000 per bag.
To avert shortage and meet demand, the caretaker government had decided to import 220,000 tons of urea from Azerbaijan but, according to sources, it could not determine a procedure for the delivery of fertiliser to the market. Farmers too have not got any benefit from the imported urea.
They were in dire need of urea for wheat crop sowing in December and January, but were forced to buy the commodity at high prices.
Earlier, the cabinet voiced concerns over the alleged fleecing of farmers by fertiliser manufacturers despite receiving heavy subsidies on gas supply. Cabinet members noted in a meeting that a high subsidy was being given to fertiliser companies, however, its impact was not being passed on to farmers, who were compelled to buy fertiliser at exorbitant prices.
Read Farmers still grappling with urea availability
The ECC of the cabinet, during its meeting, approved a basket price mechanism for the locally manufactured and imported urea following refusal by provinces and the finance ministry to share the subsidy burden. The ECC was told that the cost of financing would be charged only on 220,000 tons of imported urea.
The cabinet body agreed that NFML should determine the price for the release of imported urea while the Finance Division reiterated that no additional subsidy would be provided once the proposed basket price mechanism was enforced.
The Ministry of Industries and Production briefed the meeting that the ECC had allowed the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) to import 220,000 tons of urea from Azerbaijan’s Socar company in a government-to-government (G2G) arrangement, which was ratified by the cabinet. The ECC agreed that the cost of subsidy would be borne by provinces.
In another decision, it was agreed that the recovery of the cost of imported fertiliser would be made from provinces.
TCP told the meeting that the import of 220,000 tons was estimated to cost Rs27.489 billion and the landed price of a 50kg bag was calculated at Rs6,248.
It was decided that the locally manufactured urea and imported urea would be treated as one basket. Based on previous practices regarding local urea and full cost recovery of imported urea, a price matrix would be determined for the local manufacturers.
It was agreed that a committee would engage in talks with urea manufacturers and finalise an implementation mechanism.
Further discussions were held with the manufacturers and a mechanism for the disposal of imported urea was agreed upon. It was informed that urea manufacturers would lift 220,000 tons from port and NFML warehouses based on their share of local production as a one-off arrangement.
