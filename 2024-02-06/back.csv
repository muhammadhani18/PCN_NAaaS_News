2,Two blasts rock Balochistan,Targeted attacks highlight delicate security situation prevailing in certain regions of province," 
Two separate bomb blasts rocked the Kech and Panjgur districts of Balochistan on Tuesday.
There were no immediate reports of any casualties but the explosions prompted apprehensions about security, as the country approaches the February 8 general elections.
Unidentified assailants lobbed a grenade at the offices of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) in the Hoshop area of Kech district, levies sources told The Express Tribune. The grenade exploded on the premises of offices and extent of the damage was yet to be ascertained.
In another incident in the Surdu area of Panjgur, a bomb blast occurred at the residence of National Party (NP) leader Abdul Qadeer Sajdi. Reports indicate that the attack coincided with a crucial meeting concerning the general elections, adding a political dimension to the incident.
These targeted attacks highlight the delicate security situation prevailing in certain areas of Balochistan, ahead of the elections. Authorities are anticipated to enhance security measures to safeguard candidates, political gatherings, and electoral processes.
Recently, Balochistan has witnessed a sharp rise in the number of low-scale bomb explosions targeting election campaign office and candidates across the province. The Balochistan government has made fool-proof security measures to avert untoward incidents on the elections.

3,Expired ID cards accepted for voting,EMS hitches successfully addressed; over 260 million ballot papers handed over to the district returning officers,"Additional Director General (ADG) Haroon Shinwari on Monday said that the Election Management System (EMS) hitches have been successfully addressed as the country prepares for the ballots on February 8.
During a media briefing in Islamabad, Shinwari assured that the problems encountered during the experimental phase of EMS have been rectified, allowing individuals with expired ID cards to cast their votes.
He emphasised that those with expired IDs would not face hindrances in exercising their voting rights.
Shinwari said that a directive has been issued to all staff members, emphasising that individuals with expired ID cards should be permitted to vote.
To facilitate the election process, 3,000 laptops have been secured for EMS, and 3,600 operators have undergone training.
A dedicated control room has been established to monitor the elections, functioning independently of the internet through a private network. Shinwari highlighted the implementation of a state-of-the-art system with special provisions for monitoring.
Moreover, complaints from across the country can be filed via email and a universal phone number.
At the provincial level, control rooms have been set up, complemented by 32 regional monitoring control rooms overseeing the election process.
To address grievances, 144 district monitoring teams are actively involved. Shinwari announced the launch of a WhatsApp platform for registering complaints, marking a first in the election monitoring process.
Since December 26, notices have been served to 625 individuals, with 252 candidates receiving show-cause notices and 156 facing fines for violating the code of conduct.
Notably, 12,236 wall chalkings and hoardings have been removed, and candidates could face disqualification for serious code of conduct violations.

Shinwari revealed that 221 complaints have been received, of which 198 have been resolved. Notices have been issued to Inspector Generals and chief secretaries regarding incidents in Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
""As of February 8, the eyes of the entire nation will be on the ECP, so the elections are being closely monitored at the district, provincial, and central levels,"" he added.
He expressed satisfaction with the EMS performance during trials, asserting that results will be transmitted through the system.
All control rooms are operational 24/7, with the central room continuing uninterrupted until the election results are announced. EMS is designed to function both offline and online, he added.
ECP readies for polls with updated procedures
Meanwhile, the ECP has finalised all necessary preparations. According to sources, the chief election commissioner has opted to oversee operations from the control room on polling day instead of physically visiting the four provinces.
While the commission members are set to cover all four provinces, the ECP encountered challenges, including appeals from high courts related to polling stations, changes in election symbols, and nomination papers.
Unlike the previous election, the result management system will not be utilised this time. Instead, the EMS will be employed, wherein the returning officer in each provincial constituency will have three computers for result compilation.
The national constituency returning officer will be equipped with four computers, and Result Form 45 will be displayed outside each polling station.
According to reliable sources, presiding officers will transmit their Form 45 through EMS, which can operate without an internet connection.

5,"Choose progress over lies, Nawaz urges public","In final push for vote, PML-N Quaid promises mega development if wins fourth term","Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Quaid Nawaz Sharif concluded the party’s election campaign on Tuesday with a fervent appeal to the voters to shun ‘conman’ who ruined the country through lies and false promises and vote for progress and development of the country on Thursday (tomorrow).
Addressing the PML-N’s final election rally in Khadian Khas, Nawaz strongly criticised his rivals, particularly the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). He promised maga development project for the country should he become the prime minister for the fourth time.
In his address, Nawaz often referred to his previous stints as the prime minister when, he said, the country was steady on its path to become an ‘Asian Tiger’ – a term he used for a rapid economic growth. He added that if his governments continued, Pakistan would have become a developed country.
“If our government hadn't been ousted, Pakistan would be free of unemployment today. We could have become the 'Asian Tiger',” the three-time former prime minister asserted. “So, let’s not allow charlatans to regain power. They have wreaked havoc on Pakistan.”
Nawaz told a charged crowd that February 8 was still two days away but he could see the jubilation and the exuberance of youth among the people. “Pakistan was happy in Nawaz Sharif’s tenure and Insha Allah, I will bring back this happiness to Pakistan,” he pledged.
Nawaz said that he was holding the party’s last election meeting in Khadian, from where the PML-N President and his younger brother Shahbaz Sharif was contesting the election. He assured that on February 9, the destiny of Khadian would change forever.
Reflecting on his previous tenure in government, Nawaz highlighted the challenges he faced and emphasized overcoming them successfully.
He noted that while his administration worked diligently to propel the country forward by addressing issues like load-shedding, infrastructure development, and counterterrorism efforts, his opponents were preoccupied with disruptive sit-ins, in apparent reference to PTI
“He (Imran) had said that he would give 5 million houses, but has anyone got the house. Where did those 5 million houses go, where did 10 million jobs go? Where did the 350 dams go? Where did the billion tree project go? Instead, Pakistan lost billions of rupees,” he said taking a swipe at PTI founder.
He also compared the commodity prices during the PML-N’s government with those during the tenure of the PTI. “Today, the prices have become so high, while in our time, one kilo of vegetables was available for Rs10, one tola of gold was available for Rs50,000. How much is it worth today?”
“There were frauds, they ruined Pakistan. This injustice should never happen in Pakistan again. So, do not allow these criminals come back to Pakistan,” he said, adding: “We will rebuild this country and the youth will join us in the development of the country.”
Addressing the rally, PML-N Chief Organiser Maryam Nawaz, exhorted the PTI’s supporters to bury the politics of hatred and that she was ready to forget everything that had happened in the past. “I have a message for the youth of the PTI, who are in jails, stop hate, and I will forget everything.”
She recalled that there was character assassination of Nawaz Sharif and her. “There was mudslinging against us. I lost my mother in this struggle. However, we did not criticise him [Imran] when court decisions came against him,” she said.
She also criticised the political rivals, who said that Nawaz’s politics was over. “Today, politics starts with Nawaz Sharif and ends with Nawaz Sharif. Even so, the speech of Nawaz Sharif’s opponents starts with Nawaz Sharif and ends with Nawaz Sharif,” she said.

6,"6,000 await execution in nationwide jails",Pakistan holds one of the largest death rows globally,"Pakistan holds one of the largest death rows globally, with 6,039 prisoners awaiting execution nationwide, concentrated primarily in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces. Among them, 99% are male, while 62 are women.
In a significant event attended by public figures, policymakers, international ambassadors, and representatives of global organizations, the Justice Project Pakistan (JPP), in collaboration with the Embassy of France in Pakistan, premiered a short film titled 'Unfathomable.' This film is the first in a series shedding light on the lives of death row prisoners in Pakistan.
Sixty-seven judges from the Federal Judicial Academy, along with representatives of foreign missions, institutions, and NGOs involved in the promotion of human rights, also attended the event.
French Ambassador to Pakistan Nicolas Galey said, ""As for the supposed deterrent nature of capital punishment, it is an illusion and a lie, demonstrated by so many international statistics.""
JPP Executive Director Sarah Belal remarked that every country’s journey towards compliance with international standards on the death penalty is tethered to its own sociocultural context.
""The most important yet often overlooked step is understanding the contextual landscape within which executions have historically taken place in the country,"" she said.

Directed by Sikander-Vincent Khan, the film delves into the hardships and injustices faced by Pakistani death row prisoners throughout their lives, from childhood labor and hazardous work environments to mental illness and dire poverty. It also highlights the challenges within the criminal justice system, both during trials and on death row.
Every year, the JPP publishes an annual statistics report, ""Death Penalty in Pakistan: Data Mapping Capital Punishment,"" analyzing current trends in Pakistan's criminal justice system.
The JPP is a legal action non-governmental organization dedicated to representing the most vulnerable Pakistani prisoners facing the harshest punishments, including those facing the death penalty, mentally ill prisoners, victims of police torture, juvenile prisoners, and overseas Pakistani prisoners.
Formed in Lahore in December 2009, the JPP investigates, advocates, educates, and litigates, building public and political support as well as legal precedents that will lead to systemic reform of the criminal justice system in Pakistan.
Its work combines strategic litigation, fierce domestic and international public and policy advocacy campaigns, and building the capacity of stakeholders who can improve the representation and treatment of individuals facing capital punishment in Pakistan and abroad.

7,'Support Lion to resolve crises',Maryam vows 'highest development' for picturesque city if party secures victory in upcoming elections,"Meanwhile, addressing a political rally in Murree, the former premier’s daughter and PML-N’s senior vice president Maryam Nawaz rallied supporters and vowed the ""highest development"" for the picturesque city if the party secures victory in the upcoming elections.
She said, ""[We] promise the highest development in Murree if the city chooses lion,"" referring to the PML-N's symbolic electoral symbol.
The commitment aligns with the overarching theme of several major political parties, including the PML-N, whose election campaigns focus on addressing dire economic indicators fuelled by a weakening local currency, diminishing foreign exchange reserves, and other pressing factors.
Reaffirming the party's electoral promises outlined in the manifesto titled ""Pakistan ko Nawaz do"" (Give Pakistan to Nawaz), Maryam stressed the need to decide the future for the next generations. The seasoned politician, leading the PML-N's election campaign and contesting for the first time in the general election from NA-119 and PP-159 constituencies, highlighted the pivotal role Murree would play in shaping the nation's destiny.
Maryam Nawaz reiterated the party’s aims, including reducing electricity bills by 20-30%, achieving a 6% GDP growth, targeting $60 billion in exports, securing $40 billion in remittances, and decreasing the poverty level from 38% to 25% over the next five years.
Encouraging the crowd to support the ‘lion’, Maryam urged voters to trust the party to solve their problems.
Expressing surprise at the large gathering despite harsh weather conditions, she pledged to address the concerns of Murree's residents, particularly targeting the timber and possession mafias plaguing the city.
""We had decided to ease the difficulties of Murree's people by serving them day and night,"" Maryam asserted, outlining the party's commitment to bringing positive change to the region.

9,Bushra doesn’t want preferential treatment,Former first lady request IHC to set aside January 31 notification declaring her house a sub-jail,"In an interesting development, the former first lady, Bushra Bibi, whose residence was declared a sub-jail after her conviction in a gift repository case, has requested the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to allow her to serve her time at Adiala Jail “in the interest of justice.”
An accountability court on January 31 sentenced Bushra Bibi and her husband, former prime minister Imran Khan, to 14 years in prison in a case pertaining to the misuse of the state’s gift repository—Toshakhana—during the latter’s term as the PM.
After the court verdict, Bushra Bibi surrendered to Adiala Jail authorities where Imran has been detained since September last year and where the court heard the case and delivered its ruling.
However, after keeping her waiting at the jail’s waiting room for over ten hours, the authorities shifted the convict back to Imran Khan’s personal residence at Bani Gala in view of a notification issued by the Islamabad chief commissioner.
The chief commissioner issued the notification under Section 541 of the CrPC on the request of the Adiala Jail superintendent. Sources had then revealed to The Express Tribune that the jail authorities had received a call in which an unknown caller had threatened to attack the jail in the coming days.
Bushra has, however, moved an application, requesting the IHC to set aside the chief commissioner’s notification and allow her to serve her sentence like “other PTI workers” in an ordinary jail.
In her writ petition, the convict noted that she does not feel safe to be confined alone in the premises of the sub-jail due to potential security issues. She said there has been movement of unidentified people in her house contributing to her sense of insecurity.
She said in the absence of compelling reasons, transferring her to a sub-jail is not feasible owing to security concerns and ensuing hardships.
Bushra stated that special treatment meted out to her while other political workers are detained in ordinary jails goes against the very spirit of equality guaranteed under the Constitution and is consequently discriminatory.
“The impugned notification also goes against the principle of justice and equality as provided under Islam whereby each and every citizen is to be afforded equal treatment and no individual is superior to another or is given preferential treatment,” she added.
She said notwithstanding any grievances that the petitioner has with the mode and manner in which she was convicted and the basis of the said conviction, she as a law abiding citizen of Pakistan wishes to serve her sentence “like any other convict” at Adiala Jail.
