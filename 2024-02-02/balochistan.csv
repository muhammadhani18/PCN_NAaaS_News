Talha, a resident of Mohalla Telianwala, had recently completed his MPhil from the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad.
He had left home on a motorcycle on January 17 and not returned.
A lawyer's intervention prompted the police to register a kidnapping case on January 18, filed by Talha's brother Irfan Arshad.
The abductors had sent a video of Talha tied with a rope, through WhatsApp on January 21, demanding a ransom of Rs10 million for his release. Despite the family sending Rs2.5 million to the crypto currency account specified by the kidnappers, Talha was not released.
On Wednesday, Talha's tortured body, locked in a suitcase, was discovered in a well near a posh area.
