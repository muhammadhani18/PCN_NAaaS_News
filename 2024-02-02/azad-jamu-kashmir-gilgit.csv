1,‘Youth holds key to country’s transformation’,President stresses power of education in shaping country’s destiny,"President Dr Arif Alvi on Wednesday said through the combination of education, intellect and morality, the youth could change the fate of the country.
He said Pakistan needed leadership and proper use of intellect more than the solutions, which he believed the youth of the country was fully capable of playing this role.
Addressing the convocation of Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU), the president said Chinese development was made on the basis of education and health, and Pakistan also needed to follow the Chinese model to achieve the goals of rapid development.
Citing the example of Vietnam which was destroyed during the war in 1973, the president said that in 1999, the fisheries export of both Vietnam and Pakistan was US$300 million had now been increased to around $11 billion a year in 2022 against Pakistan’s export of only $500 million. “Resources do not develop the countries, education does,” he added.
Calling the successful graduates of the university as elite of the country, the president said they were elite because they had the privilege to secure a graduate degree in a country where 44% or more than 26 million children were still out of school.
While comparing with the region, he said all the regional countries had a 98% ratio of school-going children. “Some 55,000 schools have been built in the country so far, while to accommodate all out-of-school children, the government will have to build 50,000 more schools which is not an easy task keeping in view the resource availability in the country,” he added.
He pointed out that around 300,000 mosques in the country could be utilised to educate out-of-school children.
President Alvi regretted that the developed world was claiming to be the champion of democracy and humanity had lost the sense of sympathy with humankind.
He said the world was now running on vested interests, as zero sympathies were being shown by the West amid the atrocities being done on innocent people of Gaza.
He said Pakistan was hoping to get the Kashmir issue resolved by using the United Nations platform but despite passing over 70 years, the issue was still unresolved. “If the exploitation of wealth ends in the world and every person gets its due right, the killing of the people will automatically be stopped,” the president remarked.
He advised the successful graduates of the university to continue their struggle to seek knowledge in their practical lives. He also asked the women graduates not to spoil their education while sitting at home after getting married.

2,Study identifies drivers of child obesity,"Finds significant link between pregnant mothers’ nutrient intake, child obesity","A recent study to understand and prevent childhood obesity discovered that the nutrients mums receive before and during pregnancy can make a real difference in how much weight their children put on in the first years of their life.
The international research involved around 500 mothers and their children from New Zealand, Singapore and Britain. According to the study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal BMC Medicine, half the mothers in the study received an enriched supplement including vitamins B2, B6, B12, D, probiotics and myoinositol, together with only standard pregnancy supplementation, while the other half were in a control group and received standard pregnancy supplementation. During the study, neither the mums nor their medical teams knew which group they were in.
When researchers checked in on the children at age two years, they found half as many obese children in the cohort whose mothers were in the enriched supplement group, compared to the control group. In addition, children of the mums in the enriched supplement group were almost 25 per cent less likely to have experienced “rapid weight gain”, a condition which often leads to obesity.
“The data suggests supplementing mums before and during pregnancy can have benefits way beyond the pregnancy period for children as well as the mothers,” said University of Auckland's Liggins Institute Professor of Paediatric Endocrinology, Wayne Cutfield. ""It can impact the baby through childhood and potentially beyond,"" he said.
He further added that the next stage of the research is to try to identify which of the various nutrients in the supplement are producing beneficial impacts in terms of reducing or preventing unhealthy weight gain.
""We do not know the precise mechanism yet, but there's evidence that some of the micronutrients are associated with body metabolism during pregnancy,"" he said. The research team will continue to look at the impact of the study on the children when they are between six and eight years old.
“Rates of childhood obesity are continuing to rise in many countries, particularly in less advantaged groups. The period before and during pregnancy may provide an opportunity to support better nutritional status for the mother as it could have lasting benefits for her child,” said University of Southampton Professor, Keith Godfrey.

3,Educator stresses role of Islamic teachings,Event was presided over by Faculty of Arabic and Islamic Studies Dean Dr Shah Mohayyudin Hashmi,"Speakers at a one-day seminar titled 'Foundations of Contemporary Ethical Crisis' held at Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) Monday emphasised the role of Quranic teachings and Sunnah in tackling intellectual and ethical challenges.
The event was presided over by Faculty of Arabic and Islamic Studies Dean Dr Shah Mohayyudin Hashmi while Punjab University Professor Rashid Arshad Kaleem was invited as a guest speaker.
In his lecture, Dr Rashid emphasised the imperative role of Quranic teachings and the Sunnah in tackling intellectual and ethical issues.

Similarly, Dean Shah Mohayyudin emphasised the importance of addressing intellectual crises within the Muslim Ummah, highlighting the need to focus on internal issues before external challenges.

8,Snowy respite ignites traffic woes,"Popular hill resort receives 8.5 inches of snow, drawing tourists in droves","Although this season’s first snowfall ended the prolonged dry spell in Murree, it also brought about significant disruptions to the traffic system on the highways between Wednesday and Thursday night, prompting authorities to scramble to avoid any untoward situation. The popular hill resort received around 8.5 inches of snow over a short period, drawing a significant number of tourists.
According to sources, the district administration, law enforcement, and relief agencies collaborated to manage the situation and ensure the smooth flow of traffic. All tourist entry points, including Satra Meel in the federal capital, were closed overnight, impacting thousands of vehicles.
The Meteorological Department forecasted intermittent rain and snowfall until February 4. Approximately 4,000 vehicles entered and 1,800 exited Murree during the snowfall, causing congestion and stranding vehicles on the roadways from 8pm to 12:30am on Wednesday. The district administration, city traffic police, and Rescue 1122 Murree jointly worked to clear the expressway, successfully restoring traffic after 1am.
Following the snowfall, the picturesque landscape of Murree, adorned with a thick layer of snow on roads and trees, provided a visual treat for tourists. The local administration and municipal bodies promptly initiated road-clearing operations after the snowfall ceased. However, dissatisfaction was expressed by Murree Deputy Commissioner Agha Zaheer Abbas Shirazi when he visited the express highway, pointing out the National Highway Authority's alleged delay in utilising suitable equipment for snow clearance.
To manage the influx of visitors and ensure safety, entrance to Murree was restricted for travellers, except for its residents who were allowed after verifying their identity cards. A considerable volume of traffic entered and left Murree during the 24 hours, contributing to the challenges faced by the city's traffic police and administration. An advisory issued by the City Traffic Police and the Murree DC urged visitors to check weather forecasts and adhere to guidelines provided by the district administration.
Amidst these challenges, visitors also raised concerns about fleecing in the name of parking. A visitor from Multan reported paying Rs1,800 for covered parking, only to find his vehicle stranded in the open snow upon return. The tourism department registered the complaint and pledged to take appropriate action against those responsible, highlighting ongoing issues faced by tourists in the region.
More snow expected
The Meteorological Department has forecasted additional rains and snowfall in various hilly regions, including Murree, Galiyat, Naran, and Kaghan, over the next 24 hours.
