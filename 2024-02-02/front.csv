1,Faisalabad turns into PML-N stronghold with Nawaz’s speech,PML-N Quaid says hands raised on his call show ‘real youth’ is with his party,"Continuing with his diatribe against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Quaid Nawaz Sharif on Friday said the “real youth”, not the “mummy-daddy type”, were with his party, calling on them to play a key role in the reemergence of the party as the leading political force of Pakistan.
The three-time former premier was addressing a public gathering at the historic Iqbal Park or Dhobi Ghat ground in Faisalabad, where he asked the participants who were born in or after 1980 to raise their hands.
As a large number of the participants raised their hands, he said that it clearly negated the propaganda that the youth were with some other political parties.
The PML-N supreme leader said he was impressed by the enthusiasm of the participants in the public meeting.
He said, ""I have reliable friends and colleagues in Faisalabad since 1980.""

He particularly named Chaudhry Sher Ali, Abid Sher Ali, Talal Chaudhry, Mian Farooq and Rana Sanaullah, saying they were still steadfast and refused to succumb to any pressure to change their allegiance.
He said that his tenure was marked with maximum facilitation to the masses, adding that all commodities were cheap and available to everyone during his tenure as the prime minister.

He said gold was available at Rs50,000 per tola (now Rs216,300 per tola) and parents did not face any problem in the marriage of their daughters.
""At that time when we were fighting against the twin menace of terrorism and load shedding, others (the PTI) were observing a sit-in to achieve their ulterior motives,"" he recalled.

Nawaz said people remembered those days when the PML-N government was sent packing.
""If our rule would have continued, we would have been able to fight out poverty and unemployment,"" he added.
""We are committed to weeding out unemployment and taming inflation while the previous rulers befooled masses by raising hollow slogans of providing 10 million jobs.""

He said that the PML-N would restart the development process where it was abandoned due to his ouster from the Prime Minister House.
He said more motorways would be established to facilitate people and link different parts of the country.

Earlier, on the announcement of party President Shehbaz Sharif to provide metro bus service to Faisalabad, he said if the PML-N came to power, it would not only start metro bus service but also give a gift of orange line train to the city.
Addressing the participants, Shehbaz termed Faisalabad the citadel of PML-N, saying that enthusiasm of people clearly indicated that “they love Nawaz Sharif from the core of their hearts”.
Shehbaz said PML-N supremo Nawaz always considered Faisalabad as his second home, and when he was voted to power earlier, he launched major development projects for the city and transformed it into a dynamic city.

He said that he had visited Satiana Road in 1997 for construction of the road, adding that he always remained committed to development of the city.
He said he asked people whether they wanted metro or expressway, and they opted for an expressway, and Nawaz directed him (Shehbaz) to give the city what the people were demanding.
He termed the youth asset of the country and power of society, adding that they would be fully accommodated by providing the best quality education at their doorstep.

""We would also offer scholarships and restart distribution of laptops among talented students, so that they could exploit their quality of head and heart to build Pakistan on modern lines,"" he added.
He promised to provide the city with metro bus service, saying that if the PML-N candidates would be voted to power from Faisalabad, the party would set up a state-of-the-art Arfa Kareem IT University in this city after forming its government.

In her address, Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz urged the people to vote the PML-N to power to put Pakistan on the growth trajectory.
The PML-N SVP said she was surprised by the massive gathering, adding that huge participation in the public meeting showed that the people loved the PML-N, which had served them during its previous tenure.
She also saluted the commitment of Talal and appreciated the allegiance of Sanaullah to the party.
She said, ""We tagged him as 'Hakeem Sanaullah', who prudently tackled the situation by promoting unity among the PML-N cadres.""
She said that when Sanaullah was implicated in a fake drug-smuggling case, she went to see him.
He was wearing a mask marked with the symbol of tiger.
When asked, Sanaullah replied that if he was only two per cent with Nawaz, after that case, he was turned into a man 1,000 times with Nawaz because of the oppressive and illegal act of the ruling party – PTI.
She said that the people of Faisalabad fully honoured the commitment of Sanaullah by making the gathering a historic one.
""It seems that the people still love Nawaz Sharif, as he was always among them,"" she added. “We believe in the politics of service instead of indulging in insulting political opponents.""
She said Nawaz was ousted from power thrice, but he never compromised on national solidarity and integrity.
Shehbaz, Maryam, PML-N Punjab President Sanaullah, PML-N City President Sheikh Ejaz, former state ministers Chaudhry Abid Sher Ali, Talal Chaudhry and other leaders were also present at the rally. APP

2,"Nawaz ‘na khappay’, Bilawal’s slogan echoes at rally",PPP chairman says people of Sindh do not want to see PML-N Quaid as PM for fourth time,"In a direct jibe at the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Quaid, Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said the people of Sindh do not want to see Nawaz Sharif as the country’s prime minister for the fourth time.
“Na khappay, na khappay, Mian Sahib na khappay (Not wanted, not wanted, Nawaz Sharif not wanted),” he raised the slogan at a rally in Shikarpur on Friday, attributing it to the people of the district.
Later on Friday night, he also spoke at a news conference in Jacobabad district.
He reiterated that an alleged conspiracy was under execution to impose Nawaz on the nation as the PM for a fourth time.
“I want to convey the voice of Sindh to Islamabad that the people have given their decision that they don’t accept this conspiracy.”
He said Nawaz was giving an impression as if he had already become the PM.
According to Bilawal, the interim government was formed with the support of opposition leader Raja Riaz because no genuine opposition leader was present in parliament.
“Yesterday, Riaz was the opposition leader and today, he is fighting on the PML-N’s ticket.”
Bilawal contended that the caretaker federal government was being influenced by the PML-N, but he believed that the voters in Pakistan would put to rest the conspiracy to install Nawaz as the PM.
The PPP chairman pointed out that a large number of independent candidates had landed in the electoral fray in the country and that the perception that all the candidates belonged to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf was wrong.

“I urge the people not to waste their vote on independent candidates because the actual fight in this election is between the tiger (the PML-N’s electoral symbol) and the arrow (the PPP’s symbol). If you have to stop the tiger and you do not want to see Nawaz as the PM for a fourth time, then vote for the PPP.”
In response to the PML-N’s criticism over the PPP’s governance in Sindh, Bilawal questioned how many times Shehbaz Sharif or Maryam Nawaz visited Sindh.
“Shehbaz Sharif became the PM and how many times did he visit Sindh. Nawaz is going to become the PM for the fourth time but how many times did he visit.”
He maintained that a perception had been generated that other provinces lagged behind Punjab in terms of development.

“As if the two brothers are flowing canals of milk and honey in Punjab and their all roads are made of gold and their educational institutions have a standard higher than the Oxford University.”
He said he was fighting the general elections from Lahore and had witnessed that the ground realities there were no different from the rest of the country.
On the Jamaat-e-Islami’s criticism of the PPP, he responded that the JI was in search of a dictator like late Gen Ziaul Haq because they “know that only a dictator can make them a part of the government.”
“The people haven’t yet forgiven the JI’s mistake of supporting Ziaul Haq.”

Bilawal said parties like the JI and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan wanted to divide the people in the name of religion and ethnicity unlike the PPP.
He claimed that six attacks had been carried out on the PPP’s candidates in Balochistan.
He questioned the efficacy of the ongoing security operation in that province, saying that the way in which the ordinary people and political activists were being targeted in the name of law and order could not be condoned.
“I want all political parties to form a code of conduct after these elections so that politics can be done within the ambit of political norms and not personal revenge. This is necessary also for earning legitimacy for the electoral process in which no one is barred or impeded from the contesting.”

On the visit of Iranian Foreign Minister to Pakistan, he expressed his wish to see the security and terrorism challenges confronting the two countries resolved in an amicable way.
He also desired to complete the Pak-Iran gas pipeline project which he said was a dream of his father, former president Asif Zardari.
The PPP chairman said when he was the country’s foreign minister, he opened border markets so that the people living in the two countries along the borders could prosper.

He emphasised the need for simplifying trade and tourism relations with Iran as a long-term measure.
“Among our four neighbouring countries, we just talk to one. I want that we talk to all the four neighbours and enhance trade with them for economic benefits of the people in Pakistan and the region.”

3,LEAs land a big blow to terrorists in Balochistan,"ISPR says 24 of them killed in Mach, Kolpur ops over three days","In a stunning blow to elements out to create unrest, the security forces killed at least 24 terrorists during gunfights and intelligence based operations in Mach and Kolpur, Balochistan in the last three days, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
However, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated that four law enforcement agencies’ personnel as well as two civilians embraced martyred during the “fire fight”.
With general elections just around the corner, Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa have witnessed an uptick in terrorist activities.
Prominent political figures have been issued threats while the LEAs are grappling with the formidable challenge of upholding peace and stability in the region.
According to the statement issued by the ISPR on Friday, terrorists attacked Mach and Kolpur Complexes in Balochistan on the night of Jan 29 and 30, 2024.
“The law enforcement agencies [personnel] deputed on security offered stiff resistance and forced the attackers to repulse,” the ISPR stated, adding that these terrorists were then hunted down in the ensuing sanitisation and clearance operations which had now been concluded after clearing and securing the area.
“During the fire fights and sanitisation/clearance operations, in the last three days, 24 terrorists have been sent to hell,” the military’s media wing added. “Shehzad Baloch, Attaullah, Salahuddin, Abdul Wadood and Zeeshan are the key terrorists among the dead.
“The identification process of the remaining terrorists is in process.”
The ISPR added that however, during the intense exchange of fire, “four brave members of LEAs, having fought gallantly, embraced Shahadat along with two innocent civilians”.
The army’s media wing praised the effective response by the LEAs’ personnel, saying it was a “testament of their unrelenting resolve in the fight against terrorism”.
“Pakistan's security forces stand shoulder to shoulder with other law enforcement agencies to ensure peace and stability in the country,” it added.
On Thursday, one person was killed and five others injured in three separate attacks in different areas of Balochistan.
The body and injured were immediately rushed to the hospital for medical assistance.
Following the attack, the security forces swiftly cordoned off the affected sites.
Meanwhile, a protest against the killing of National Assembly candidate Rehan Zeb continued at Khar Bazaar, Bajaur. Zeb was shot dead on Wednesday by unidentified assailants while campaigning in Bajaur district’s Sadiqabad Phattak Bazaar.
On Tuesday, unidentified miscreants lobbed a hand grenade at the election office of the PPP on Sariab Road in Quetta, injuring five people.
According to police, Ali Madad Jatak, the PPP candidate for the provincial assembly seat in Quetta, was not present at the office at the time of the attack.
Miscreants also threw a hand grenade at the residence of Mir Zahoor Buledi, the PPP’s candidate for a provincial assembly seat in Kech district.
A bomb blast on a main road in Balochistan’s Sibi during an election rally led by Saddam Tareen – a PTI-affiliated independent candidate for the NA-253 (Ziarat) constituency – left at least four people dead and five others injured.
An ANP activist, identified as Zahoor Ahmed, was killed and another injured when armed men opened fire in the Maizai Addah area of Qilla Abdullah.
On Monday night, security forces had thwarted three “coordinated attacks” launched by terrorists using rockets and sophisticated weapons in Mach, some 70 kilometres from the provincial capital.
The terrorists also targeted a hotel and six shops in the Kolpur area and set them on fire.
The Election Commission of Pakistan while expressing deep concern over the terror attacks sought an immediate report from the Balochistan chief secretary and inspector general.
Further, according to the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD), 15 political figures in K-P received threats from extremists in connection with the upcoming general elections.
Releasing a list of such individuals, the CTD maintained that threats had been issued to former National Assembly member Mohsin Dawar, ex-provincial minister Imtiaz Qureshi, Senator Hidayatullah, former PML-N MNA Amir Muqam, PTI leaders Pir Musawir Shah and Shah Muhammad as well as JUI-F’s Malik Adnan Wazir and Ehsanullah.
Senators Bakhti Afsar and Maulana Abdur Rasheed were also threatened by the extremists.
The CTD stated that the police officials of the concerned districts have been informed about the threats, and directed for additional security of the listed politicians.

4,Shehbaz fully trusts Gen Asim,PML-N president says there is no possibility of any conspiracy in the presence of army chief," 
Former prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday expressed confidence in the incumbent Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir, saying that there would be no possibility of any conspiracy in his presence.
Speaking during the Express News programme ‘Kal Tak’, Shehbaz said that he worked with army chief Gen Asim for seven months, and found him very serious about the development of the country.
Shehbaz emphasised that PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif would be the next prime minister, in any case. “Nawaz Sharif can bring the nation together and he wishes to forget the past and move forward,” the former prime minister told the interviewer.
“Nawaz Sharif has presented the election manifesto, which has been prepared after much consultation. If we get the opportunity, if Nawaz Sharif gets the post of prime minister for the fourth time, he will make all out efforts to make the country a welfare state,” he said.
“Stability will come when the country becomes a welfare state. If there is economic development, all the sit-ins [protests] will end. If the government gets time to work, there will be progress,” he said. “Nawaz Sharif has given a clear message that he will take everyone along.”
In response to a question about Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan, Shehbaz said that if someone had committed a crime, he would have to face the law.
“One who has committed a crime will face the law, there cannot be any cover-up.”
He emphasised that before Imran’s premiership, there used to be a lot of bitterness, but the political rivals would get together at social events, and talk to each other to find a way out.
“National unity and political dialogue is the need of the hour,” he said.
The PML-N president, who replaced Imran as the prime minister after his removal through a no-confidence motion in April 2022, stressed that he did not wish to sound harsh about the PTI founder, who was in jail now, put the state at stake for his own cheap publicity.
“Imran Khan was ready to do anything for his own self. He signed the agreement with the IMF (International Monetary Fund), but then he himself violated it. The reason for the current inflation is the PTI founder. We had no choice but to swallow the bitter pill of the IMF,” he said.
When asked that both Miftah Ismail and Ishaq Dar, the two finance ministers during Shehbaz’s term in office, failed to reach an agreement with the IMF, Shehbaz said that Dar was “very hardworking”. “We saved the country from bankruptcy.”
The former prime minister emphasised that a lame government could not bring any stability. He also stressed that the debate about ‘Ladla’ (favourite) should end now and the country should move forward. To another question, he said: “We will accept whomever the nation votes for.”
Asked further if he wanted to make Lahore like Karachi, Shehbaz wished Karachi to be the most beautiful city in the world. However, he said that unfortunately, there was no water available to the people of the Sindh capital and the roads were broken there. “Karachi has been brutalised.”

The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet also approved Rs396 million funds for repair of ministers’ homes, a structure at the Prime Minister’s House and construction of the Supreme Court monument, according to a finance ministry handout.
The money had not been budgeted but it would be given by the finance ministry by deducting from other heads. It approved summaries from the housing and works ministry and the PWD for provision of funds worth Rs25 million, Rs319.5 million and allocation of Rs51.96 million for various projects.
The ECC “gave approval” to a comprehensive sustainable plan for price rationalisation of subsidised wheat in Gilgit-Baltistan, according to the ministry statement. It approved to withdraw wheat subsidy for the 40% population of G-B, falling in two higher income brackets.
The wheat subsidy of the fifth income quantile stood immediately withdrawn, affecting about 228,000 people, out of 1.2 million total population. For the fourth income quantile, it would be withdrawn after the ground survey.
The Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan affairs ministry had also demanded Rs6 billion additional funds and 150,000 metric tons more wheat to provide the subsidised commodity. The ECC decided in principle to give the money, however, the source of funding could not be established.
Some ECC members advocated continuing the subsidy but the finance ministry firmly opposed it. The special region gets wheat at Rs13 per kilogramme as against Rs130 per kilogramme in the rest of Pakistan.
Both finance and the Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan Affairs ministries would work out the modalities to provide the money for subsidy for the remaining 60% of the population, according to the decision, which had been taken at a time when the G-B population was protesting against the withdrawal of the subsidy.
The ECC also approved to recover Rs17 billion additional from the domestic gas consumers to pay for the subsidies to two fertiliser plants based in Punjab. The money should have been given from the budget but its burden had been passed on to the domestic consumers, who were already facing up to 1,108% increase in gas prices.
The Petroleum Division had proposed that the supply of RLNG to FatimaFert and Agirtech Ltd may be continued at Rs1,239 per mmbtu for the period of January to March 2024 and the differential of price with RLNG for such supply to be treated as RLNG diversion to domestic sector for recovery through SNGPL’s revenue requirements to be determined by Ogra.
In November last year, the ECC had approved to continue supply of RLNG to both fertiliser plants – the FatimaFert and the Agritech – till end December at OGRA determined rate of Rs1,239 per mmbtu.
The price differential between OGRA’s notified RLNG price and Rs1,239 per mmbtu will be made part of revenue requirements of the SNGPL by OGRA in its revenue requirement determination in January, 2024, according to the decision.
Also, the prime minister had chaired a meeting in December on fertiliser issues and directed that the provincial governments should contribute to the subsidy as per their share in urea dispatches for gas supplied to urea manufacturers from January-March 2024.
Subsequently, the SIFC decided that the federal government should contribute a subsidy of around Rs20 billion on LNG for fertiliser plants but since agriculture was a provincial subject, the provinces must contribute by sharing the burden of this subsidy.
However, none of the provinces agreed to contribute in the cost differential, rather they opined that RLNG at full cost may be supplied to both the plants for urea production and produced urea may accordingly be sold at full cost recovery.
Only element of cost of RLNG in urea per bag at current RLNG price of $13 per mmbtu works out to be Rs5,600 per bag, excluding other incidentals, therefore, selling of produced urea at notified RLNG price will distort the entire urea supply market, leading to undue profiteering by sellers at the cost of farmers.
The ECC approved Rs500 million grant for modernisation Of Hydromet Services. It also approved Rs38.9 million for Institutional Reforms Cell (IRC) from Cabinet Division and summary for Importation of Sahiwal Bull from Pakistan as semen donors for the National Artificial Insemination (AI) Programme from the commerce ministry was also approved by the ECC after discussion.
The summaries of the finance ministry for approval of the Technical Supplementary Grant (TSG) for Rehabilitation of flood damaged rural roads in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa through the Counter-Value Fund deposited under the Japanese grant aid, and provision of clean drinking water were also approved.
The ECC approved provision of additional funds amounting to Rs1.6 billion through technical supplementary grant for the procurement of servers and hiring consultants. The ECC gave approval to Rs7.15 billion for “Actions To Strengthen Performance For Inclusive And Responsive Education”(ASPIRE) for federal education and professional training.
The summary presented by the food security ministry regarding demand and supply of wheat in the country was discussed at length and got approved. The ECC also gave approval of Rs4 billion for 7th Population & Housing Census.
In a major decision, it approved to convert power purchase agreement on new lending instrument, transitioning from London Inter-Bank offer rate (Libor) to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). This will increase the idle capacity payment charges.
Meanwhile the G-B government agreed to increase wheat quota from 1.1 million bags to 1.6 million bags, which would cater to the needs of the people the region, according to a notification issued here on Thursday.
The notification said that one kilogramme of wheat would now be available t Rs220 instead of Rs360, which was fixed during December 2023. According to the announcement, in the quota enhancement, each person would now receive 7.315 kilograms of wheat instead of 3 kilogrammes.
