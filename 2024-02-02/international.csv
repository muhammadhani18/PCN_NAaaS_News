1,Bilawal vows to resolve missing persons issue,PPP chief says is capable of securing Balochistan rights; issues warning to ‘conspirators’,"Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari vowed on Thursday to confront saboteurs in Balochistan and resolve the issue of missing persons, if the party formed the government after winning the February 8 general elections.
Address a workers convention during his first-ever visit to Khuzdar town of Balochistan, as a part of his election campaign, Bilawal warned that those conspiring against the PPP, were misguided if they thought he could be intimidated.
If given the opportunity, Bilawal said, he would not only confront saboteurs but also work towards resolving the issue of missing persons. Rejecting the politics of hatred and division, he emphasised that the PPP was the only party capable of securing the rights of Balochistan.
“The PPP is the only party that can give Balochistan its rights,” he continued. He told the audience that being the son of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, he understood the people’s pain and he comprehended the struggles of the Balochistan martyrs.

Bilawal downplayed the recent attacks against the party candidates in the province, terming those a “futile attempt” to instil fear. “The PPP is built on the sacrifices of martyrs. It will not bow down to terrorism,” he said, reiterating his commitment to thwarting conspiracies against the PPP.
He stated that his connection to the Balochistan was profound, and the conspirators were targeting the PPP because they recognised that his leadership, coupled with a PPP-led government in Balochistan, would dismantle their nefarious designs.
“The conspirators know that if I become the prime minister and a Jayala becomes the chief minister of Balochistan, their schemes will crumble,” Bilawal declared.

3,Nawaz labels Imran a cunning deceiver,PML-N supremo asks people of K-P how many of them got one of the pledged 5m houses,"Former prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supreme leader Nawaz Sharif on Thursday took a swipe at Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan without directly naming him, questioning the fulfilment of the promises made by Imran during his tenure in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and accused him of deceiving the people.
Addressing a spirited crowd during a rally in Swat, Nawaz questioned the efficacy of Imran’s pledge to generate 10 million jobs and provide five million houses. 
“Raise your hands and tell me how many people here got one of the five million houses,” he challenged the audience, highlighting the alleged failure of the promises made by Imran’s government.
“The people of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa are very simple people; are you (Imran Khan) not ashamed of deceiving them? Why were false promises made to the public? You secured votes by playing with people’s emotions; later, they were neither given jobs nor any relief,” Nawaz asserted, criticising the credibility of the commitments made by the PTI founder.
The PML-N supremo went on to express his scepticism about the success of the ‘billion-tree tsunami’ project, a cornerstone initiative of Imran’s government.

“I have come looking the whole way, but I did not see any ‘one billion tree tsunami’. He played with your emotions and took your vote, and later neither gave you a job nor any relief… in the process, you destroyed the old Pakistan as well,” Nawaz remarked, referencing Imran’s slogan of building a new Pakistan.
The PML-N supremo took pride in his own government’s accomplishments, emphasising that his administration ended electricity load shedding in Pakistan. He questioned the wisdom of the people in K-P for supporting Imran despite the achievements of his government.
“If there was Nawaz Sharif’s government here, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa would have been the most beautiful province.
