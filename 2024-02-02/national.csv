0,Caretakers also leave double-digit inflation,"Jan inflation stands high at 28.3%, in line with finance ministry’s projection","Pakistan’s inflation rate slightly moderated to 28.3% in January 2024 but prices in all groups of commodities showed a double-digit rise, an outcome of frequent increases in energy prices to meet conditions of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) loan programme and supply disruptions.
The 28.3% inflation was in line with the projection of the Ministry of Finance, which a day earlier significantly raised its old forecast. The interim government too is leaving behind a high inflation as general elections are slated for February 8 after which a new government will take over.
For many years, forecasts of the federal government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) have proved incorrect. Now, price stability is the primary objective of the central bank after it was granted autonomy two years ago under an IMF deal.
Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported a slight moderation in inflation, both in urban and rural areas. But the inflation was still higher than the two-month-old projection, which both the central bank and the finance ministry later revised upwards.
Last month, prices of food and energy items increased further in both rural and urban areas. On the back of an alarming surge of up to 520% in gas prices during the first round, the overall inflation kept soaring across the country. It increased to 30.2% in cities and to 25.7% in rural areas.
Non-food inflation eased to 32.3% in urban areas and to 26.3% in rural areas, though it was still very high. Commodities like wheat flour, rice, tea, sugar, beverages, potatoes and pluses saw a significant increase in their prices last month compared to a year ago.
Food inflation decelerated in both cities and rural areas. In urban centres, it slowed down to 27.4% while in villages and towns, it eased to 25.1%.
People’s purchasing power has taken a hit due to a constant double-digit increase in prices of essential and durable goods. Successive governments have also significantly increased the tax burden, particularly on the salaried class.
The interim government increased prices of electricity and gas under the IMF deal, which kept overall prices high. PBS bulletin showed that gas got expensive by 520% while electricity charges surged 71% in January compared to a year ago.
Read Inflation to stay at 28.5% despite ‘economic stabilisation’
However, the core inflation, which does not include energy and food items, eased to 17.8% in urban areas and 24.6% in rural areas. It is still above the central bank’s policy rate of 22%.
Former SBP Governor Dr Reza Baqir had agreed with the IMF that Pakistan would set the policy rate in line with the general inflation by delinking it from the core indicator. As a result, the central bank has not been able to slash the policy rate despite a slowdown in the core inflation.
This has massively increased the cost of interest payments on loans, which is now more than the federal government’s net income.
There was a double-digit increase in prices of all 12 groups of commodities monitored by the PBS. Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages went up 25% in January compared to a year ago. Non-perishable goods got dearer by 24% while perishable goods saw a surge of 31%.
The inflation rate for the consumer transport group rose 26% despite a reduction in fuel prices. However, the finance ministry on Thursday announced an increase of Rs13 per litre in the price of petrol while reversing the downward trend.
The government and the central bank are again set to miss their annual inflation target of 21%. PBS reported that for the July-January period of the current fiscal year, the average inflation stood at 28.7%. It was far higher than the official target of 21%.
Average inflation in rural areas was 29.3% for the first seven months whereas it was 28.3% in urban areas. The central bank’s hopes that the inflation rate would dip below 20% on the back a higher reading during the second half of last fiscal year have once again been dashed. The government has also agreed with the IMF on a further increase in gas prices with effect from February.

1,Lack of economic agenda tests PSX,"Challenges short-term business confidence, despite promising medium-to-long-term outlook","The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has experienced a tumultuous ride, mirroring the frenzy leading up to the upcoming general elections. The once-positive election fervour has morphed into election anxiety, temporarily shattering short-term business confidence, despite the prevailing promising medium-to-long-term outlook.
The KSE 100 Index, a benchmark for PSX, witnessed a remarkable 27% surge since the announcement of the election date in the first week of November 2023. Scaling unprecedented heights, it peaked at over 67,000 in mid-December 2023.
Scheduled for the next week on February 8, 2024, the parliamentary polls initially ignited a rally fuelled by optimism surrounding early signs of economic recovery and the anticipated substantial rise in low-priced stocks across the board. However, as the year 2023 drew to a close, investors chose to sell stocks to secure profits. Unfortunately, this trend failed to be accompanied by renewed buying, leading to an almost 8% decline from the all-time high. The index hit a one-month low at 61,842 points on January 30, 2024.

 
In a conversation with The Express Tribune, Muhammad Awais Ashraf, Director of Research at Akseer Securities, pointed out that election uncertainty is unsettling investor sentiments, temporarily impacting business confidence and contributing to the downturn of the PSX index.
He highlighted the crucial role of the electorate, urging the nation to vote for the formation of a robust political government at both the central and provincial levels. He stressed that a strong government, secured through winning a majority of seats, is essential to implementing the necessary economic reforms. Conversely, a weaker coalition government or a hung parliament he said would be inadequate for steering the economy, entering into a new IMF loan programme, and addressing the promising future. A weak government, he argued, could exacerbate pre-election uncertainty.
Director of Research at Chase Securities, Yousuf M Farooq shared an optimistic outlook, stating that the end of political uncertainty would spur renewed buying. He highlighted the continued rise in sale revenue and net profit of listed companies.
Political uncertainty escalated following the sentencing of former Prime Minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf founding Chairman Imran Khan to a 10-year jail term in a cypher case, leading to extended sales at PSX.

 
Farooq clarified that political uncertainty is just one of the contributing factors to the recent correction in the bourse. Other factors include extended foreign selling over the past few days and the State Bank of Pakistan maintaining a record-high policy rate of 22% for the next six weeks.
Fitch Ratings, a globally renowned credit rating agency, reported last week that most frontier market nations, including Pakistan, are set to hold general elections in 2024. The agency observed a slowdown in reform momentum leading up to elections, with Asia-Pacific’s GDP growth (including Pakistan) expected to outperform other regions amid a global economic slowdown.
Several local research houses anticipated a 25-30% growth in the benchmark index in late November and early December 2023. They projected the PSX to reach somewhere in the range of 75,000-81,000 points by the end of the current calendar year 2024, up from the levels of around 60,000 points.

Despite the recent return of sharp volatility, these research houses maintained their projections for the year, anticipating that the rally would resume and reach the projected levels post-elections.
PSX AND ELECTION HISTORY
Arif Habib Limited, Head of Research, Tahir Abbas reiterated the necessity of political stability for economic growth and its reflections in the PSX.
Reflecting on the historical context, Abbas stated that elections impact the capital market based on the provided pre-election situation, economic roadmap, and policies given by new governments.
Comparing the past four general elections in the country since 2002, Abbas noted that the PSX declined before and after the 2018 elections, while it grew before and after the prior three elections.
In the three months before the last polls held in 2018, the PSX declined by 9%, dropping by another 8.8% in the three months after PTI came into power through the elections. The market witnessed a significant 21% decline in the one year post the 2018 election, marked by political polarisation and protests impacting the market in both pre and post-election periods.
Contrastingly, the benchmark KSE 100 Index increased by 15% in the three months before the 2013 elections, surging by 16% in the three months after the election when the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz formed the government. The market experienced a notable 41.5% surge in the one year post the 2013 elections.
Before the 2008 election, the PSX went up by 8% in the three months leading to the election but declined by 1% in the three months post the election when the Pakistan People’s Party formed the government. In the one-year period post the elections, the market slumped by 59.3%, influenced by the historical financial crisis of 2008.

In 2002, the market saw an 18% increase in the three months before the election, followed by another 32% surge in the three months post the elections. It spiked by 97% in the one-year period post the elections.
Abbas expressed confidence in the market’s upward trajectory post the 2024 elections. He believed that the next government, regardless of its composition, would provide a solid economic roadmap. Additionally, stocks are still available at attractive prices.
In December 2023, the benchmark index hit a record high at over 67,000 points, though majority share prices were still below their historical peak prices, presenting attractive buying opportunities, he said.
To recap, the market surged by almost 15% net since November 8, 2023, three months ahead of the February 8 election.
POPULAR SLOGANS VS INFLATION
Topline Research provided a detailed commentary on the 2024 election, highlighting that major parties are not adequately addressing key economic challenges. Instead, they focus more on popular measures to gain public confidence amid record-high inflation.
Investors are keenly interested in whether the new government will secure a majority or if it will form a weak coalition government. According to Topline Research, if one party secures 50% plus seats, it would boost investors’ confidence, leading to positive market reactions and signalling positively to the International Monetary Fund and other lenders.
Conversely, a coalition government with the support of smaller parties is predicted to remain fragile and may struggle to implement much-needed economic reforms.
The recovery of the Pakistan Stock market is expected to continue in 2024. Projections indicate that the benchmark KSE-100 total return index will reach 75,000 by December 2024. Key drivers for equities in 2024 include a smooth transfer of power to the new government after elections, a new long-term funding programme from the IMF, and an expected fall in interest rates.

2,Bulls take charge over election timing clarity,"KSE-100 index rises 414.56 points, settles at 62,393.74","Bulls staged a comeback at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday, pushing the KSE-100 index up by over 400 points as investors rejoiced at the elections remaining on schedule despite political noise.
After taking a heavy battering earlier in the week when uncertainty about the timely holding of elections hovered over the market, investor sentiment flipped and bulls took charge, helping the index move forward.
Bullish activity was also driven by speculation about the government’s resolve to curtail the power-sector circular debt following the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) approval.
The index touched the intra-day high at 62,480.23 during late hours owing to cherry-picking by investors and closed the day just shy of 62,400.
“Stocks closed bullish on reports of timely general elections after the ECP (Election Commission of Pakistan) meeting and upbeat data of exports that surged 26.9% year-on-year to $2.786 billion in January while trade deficit fell 39% to $12.24 billion for Jul-Jan FY24,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.

“Speculation about the government’s resolve to slash power-sector circular debt after IMF’s approval played the role of catalyst in bullish close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 414.56 points, or 0.67%, and settled at 62,393.74.
Topline Securities, in its report, remarked that it was a “trend reversal day”.
Earlier, while continuing Wednesday’s momentum, Pakistan equities went into the negative zone. However, at the day’s low, value hunters opted to do some cherry-picking, which helped the index to close up by 415 points at 62,394, it said.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 270.5 million shares against Wednesday’s tally of 276.5 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs11.6 billion.

3,Forex reserves dip $54m to $8.21b,"Despite outflows due to foreign debt repayment, the reserves remain robust","Pakistan’s central bank, on Thursday, reported that the country’sforeign exchange reserves reached $8.21 billion, marking a 0.6% week-on-week decline as of January 26, 2024. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) explained that the reduction was attributed to debt repayments. The SBP’s foreign currency reserves experienced a $54 million drop compared to the previous week total of $8.27 billion. Including commercial banks’ reserves, the country’s total liquid foreign currency reserves amounted to $13.26 billion, with commercial banks holding net reserves of $5.04 billion.
In its weekly update, the central bank highlighted the positive impact of recent inflows, including the second tranche of $705.6 million from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under its $3 billion ongoing loan programme. Despite outflows due to foreign debt repayment, the reserves remained robust.
Read Forex reserves hit 6-month high at $8.27b
Arif Habib Limited CEO Shahid Ali Habib highlighted on social media that the elevated reserve levels played a crucial role in stabilising the Pakistani rupee against the US dollar.
The IMF’s upward revision for Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves to $9.1 billion by June 2024 suggests a continued gradual growth momentum. Last week, reserves briefly dropped to $8.27 billion, likely due to foreign debt repayment.

4,"Industrialists urge customised financing, infrastructure overhaul","Present recommendations to 2024 government, advocate for consistent industrial policy","Leading industrialists have presented proposals to bolster the national economy to the upcoming government. Their recommendations include introducing a customised low-cost financing scheme, evolving an urban and consistent industrial policy, revamping crumbling road infrastructure, and implementing a one-window operation, among other initiatives.
Speaking to the Express Tribune about expectations from the upcoming elected government after the 2024 general poll, business leaders stressed the need for a customised low-cost financing scheme specifically for the construction of industrial units in the small and medium-sized sector. They highlighted the significance of SMEs as the backbone of any country.
President of the Site Association of Industry (SAI), Muhammad Kamran Arbi, stressed the importance of proper utility services for industrial operations. He called for the upcoming government to address utility issues, including gas, electricity, and water, with regionally competitive rates and improved services to support economic growth. Arbi suggested the establishment of a mechanism for a one-window operation to streamline interactions with the more than 65 federal and provincial departments that impact industrialists, traders, and investors throughout the year.
He also underscored the promotion of e-commerce to save time and transportation costs, facilitating ease of doing business. He urged the government to ensure law and order in Karachi and promptly establish an urban and consistent industrial policy with input from all stakeholders, especially industrialists, to address industry challenges on a top priority basis.
Another prominent industrialist, Salahuddin Qureshi, called for a comprehensive revamping of the road infrastructure in all industrial zones of Sindh, including Karachi and Hyderabad. Poor road conditions contribute to increased transportation costs, affecting productivity. Qureshi suggested emulating successful models, like Bangladesh’s planning commission, for swift issue resolution. He urged the newly-elected government to follow similar initiatives to enhance exports, control inflation, generate jobs, and ensure facilities for local industrialists and investors.

Qureshi specifically called for supplying electricity and allocating an Express Feeder for Sindh small industries in Phase-II on Tando Mohammad Khan road. He also highlighted the importance of giving possession to an industrial plot spreading 300 acres of land allotted in 2007 in SITE Hyderabad. He pleaded for the government to provide maximum facilities for local investors and industrialists, encouraging public-private partnerships in rural areas to eliminate poverty and generate employment.
President of the Federal B Area Association of Trade and Industries (FBATI), Syed Raza Hussain, proposed a financing scheme of up to Rs500 million through commercial banks, with a favourable markup rate of 5–6% over 20 years. This scheme aims to encourage small and medium-sized entrepreneurs to construct industrial units, focusing on domestic and export markets. The emphasis is on construction activities to accelerate economic activities in major cities, preventing the loss of precious foreign exchange through machinery imports.
Hussain highlighted that the financing scheme would revive growth in allied sectors, generate employment, and contribute additional revenues through taxes. He urged the government to introduce an easy markup scheme for local brands and SMEs, enhancing economic activities across the country and curbing imports of foreign brands that burden the current account and foreign exchange reserves.

5,"Exports remain robust, rise 27% in Jan",Trade gap contracts nearly $8b in first seven months of FY24,"Federal Minister of Interior, Commerce and Industries Dr Gohar Ejaz has announced that Pakistan’s exports remained highly positive in January 2024 as shipments to overseas markets increased 26.9% to $2.786 billion as compared to $2.195 billion in January 2023.
Imports, however, decreased 4.5% to $4.665 billion in January against $4.884 billion in the corresponding month of last year. Consequently, the country’s trade deficit significantly narrowed to $1.879 billion in January as compared to $2.689 billion in January last year.
“This is a substantial improvement from last year,” the commerce minister remarked while citing the contraction in trade gap, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Commerce on Thursday.

Overall, in the first seven months (July-January) of FY24, Pakistan’s trade performance remained “robust”. Trade figures for the seven months showed that Pakistan was steadily expanding its international footprint, it said. Exports amounted to $17.766 billion in Jul-Jan FY24, up 12% from $15.831 billion during the same period of the previous fiscal year.
Imports contracted 16% to $30.010 billion in the seven months under review as compared to $35.836 billion in the same period of last year. As a result, the trade deficit shrank 39% to $12.244 billion, significantly lower than the gap of $20.005 billion in the previous year.
In absolute terms, during Jul-Jan FY24, exports increased almost $2 billion while imports went down about $6 billion and trade deficit contracted $7.8 billion.
The minister said, “I am confident that Pakistan is on the right track to achieve its trade goals and become a leading player in the global economy.”

6,PIA debt burden shifted to taxpayers,"Govt backtracks; agrees to making principal, interest payments from budget","The government and commercial banks have agreed on a Rs268 billion debt restructuring plan for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). This move, while shifting the burden of PIA’s inefficiency onto taxpayers, removes an irritant in its privatisation. The Ministry of Finance, abandoning its previous stance of not incorporating PIA debt into public debt, now commits to making principal and interest payments from the budget.
Under the agreement, the government will use PIA sale proceeds for principal payments, resorting to the budget if insufficient funds are available. Banks, in return, accept a 10-year debt rollover with a 12% annual interest rate, amounting to Rs32.2 billion in annual interest payments.
This arrangement means banks will receive Rs322 billion in interest payments over a decade, exceeding their outstanding stocks of Rs268 billion. The total payout to banks at a 12% interest rate will be Rs572 billion in 10 years, said the sources.
The Ministry of Finance will seek the endorsement of the International Monetary Fund due to implications of the arrangement on the budget, and the banks will go to their respective board of directors for approval, according to sources. A response from the Ministry of Finance spokesperson, on the circumstances that led to a change of heart at the ministry, was awaited until the filing of this story.
In March 2023, the finance ministry had stopped making interest payments on the PIA debt, compelling the government and the PIA management to look for the option for its privatisation. However, there are concerns that the commercial banks’ debt restructuring in isolation can delay its privatisation. The agreed restructuring and ownership of the PIA debt by the finance ministry ends the single biggest worry of the airline, which also takes away the single largest monthly charge from its balance sheet.
Privatisation Minister Fawad Hasan Fawad remained persistent in his demand to make PIA debt part of public debt, Finance Secretary, Imdad Ullah Bosal, and Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar finally agreed to the proposal with some caveats. Sources said that as per the understanding in the finance ministry, the privatisation ministry, and the representatives of nine commercial banks, the Rs268 billion debt, including Rs250 billion principal, is being restructured for 10 years.
The government will pay an interest rate equal to the one-year Karachi Interbank Rate (KIBOR) but capped at 12%. The interest payments will be made annually.
Read Plan for PIA sell-off submitted
The principal payments will be made out of the privatisation proceeds and the sale of other fixed assets. If, however, there are no proceeds available, the finance ministry will settle the payments from the budget. Sources said that the privatisation minister also informed the finance ministry that the plan to sell the Roosevelt Hotel and Scribe hotel has been shelved at this stage. Instead, the Roosevelt Hotel will be demolished, and a new structure will be built in the coming years.
Despite the agreement on the most contentious issue affecting its privatisation, PIA is nowhere close to privatisation. The total outstanding debt of the airline is Rs825 billion, and the privatisation ministry and PIA have to seek no objection certificates from the Civil Aviation Authority and Federal Board of Revenue to file a scheme of arrangement with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). A Scheme of Arrangement, segregating PIA into core and non-core entities, could not be filed with the SECP due to the absence of statutory audited accounts of PIA until September 2023 and no-objection certificates from creditors.
The finance minister said two weeks ago that PIA’s Rs825 billion debt would be transferred into a holding company. “I do not know what to do with this debt,” remarked the finance minister while speaking at a seminar on the economic issues of the country.
The banks have agreed to give an NOC to SECP to transfer their debt worth Rs268 billion into the holding company and vacating their claim on PIA’s assets. The Privatisation Commission board had approved the transaction structure to sell a minimum of 51% stake after cleansing its balance sheet by transferring almost three-fourths of the Rs825 billion to a new company. The board also approved setting up a new holding company in which to park the debt.
The privatisation minister was hopeful that he would be able to sell PIA before the end of the caretaker government tenure, which looks like it will not happen.
The federal government has rejected some other demands put forth by the banks. The banks had requested that the PIA debt be considered eligible for the Capital Requirement Regulations (CRR), but the finance ministry declined this proposal. Similarly, the banks’ request for deferring tax payments on the profits they would earn was also turned down. Sources said that the banks have also asked for firm commitment that the PIA privatisation will not be halted after the clearing of its balance sheet.
