0,Voter surge makes Pakistan fifth largest democracy in world,Country witnesses substantial increase of 22.5 million voters including 12.5 million women,"With the fifth-highest number of registered voters globally, Pakistan has a record 128 million people, constituting over half of its total population, registered as voters on the final electoral rolls for the upcoming general elections scheduled for February 8.
It means there is a substantial increase of 22.5 million voters including 12.5 million women since 2018, according to a Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) report titled as “Electoral Rolls, General Election 2024”. The report was released on Wednesday.
This unprecedented surge brings the total number of registered voters to 128,585,760 in 2024, marking a significant rise from 106,000,239 in 2018 and 86,189,828 in 2013.
This makes Pakistan the fifth largest democracy in the world after India, Indonesia, United States and Brazil. This is also the first time that Pakistan registered more women voters as compared to men in-between two elections.
Presently, the number of registered voters constitutes 53.2 percent of the 241.49 million population. Nevertheless, there are regional disparities in voter-to-population ratios, with Punjab (57 percent) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (53 percent) registering over half of their populations as voters.
Sindh and Islamabad have voter-to-population ratios close to 50 percent, while Balochistan lags behind with 36 percent population registered as voters.
The voter-to-population ratio can be indicative of potential under-registration with a caveat. The ratio only accounts for voters registered in their native districts and not those who are registered as voters on their temporary addresses outside their native districts.
At the district and constituency levels, the disparity in voter proportions becomes increasingly apparent. Among the 136 districts analyzed by Fafen, 78 have more than half of their populations registered as voters, while nine districts including Upper Kohistan, Lower Kohistan, Kohistan Palas, Kech, Kharan, Panjgur, Sherani, Surab and Washuk have less than 30 percent population registered.
A comparable trend is noted at the National Assembly constituency level, with 159 out of 266 constituencies registering over 50 percent of their populations as voters.
The registration of women has experienced an unprecedented increase since 2018, following the implementation of special measures introduced by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in accordance with Section 47 of the Elections Act, 2017.
The final electoral rolls reflect encouraging progress in narrowing the gender gap in voter registration. The collaborative efforts by the ECP, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), and civil society have played a vital role in raising awareness, mobilizing communities, and facilitating women’s participation in the electoral process, leading to significant improvements in most regions.
These targeted initiatives have positively impacted gender parity in voter registration, reducing the overall gender gap from 12.4 million (11.8 percent) in 2018 to 9.9 million (7.7 percent) in the final electoral rolls for 2024 general elections.
Since 2018, as many as 2.5 million more women have been registered than men out of the 22.5 million new voters added to the electoral rolls.
The number of districts with a gender gap exceeding 10 percent has decreased from 85 in 2018 to 29 in 2024, and the number of National Assembly constituencies with a gender gap above 10 percent has declined from 173 in 2018 to 38 in 2024.
However, challenges persist, particularly in Balochistan, where the overall gender gap remains above 10 percent. The regional distribution of the 9.9 million gender gap reflects women’s registration as a national issue.
More than half of the overall gender gap, five million, is in Punjab, followed by 2.2 million in Sindh, and 1.9 million in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Balochistan is the only province where the overall gender gap remains above 10 percent.

1,Lower-caste Hindus see greater presence,"About a dozen Hindus participating in elections from Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas divisions","Lower-caste Hindus in Pakistan are carving a niche for themselves in the political arena, boldly stepping into the electoral fray on general seats.
The surge in participation is particularly pronounced in the Mirpur Khas division, home to districts such as Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, and Tharparkar, where a majority population of non-Muslims, especially Hindus, resides.About a dozen Hindus are participating in elections from Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas divisions, with a key focus on NA-215 Mithi, NA-213 Umerkot, and PS-45 Mirpurkhas. Notably, all three candidates in these constituencies are up against Muslim opponents.
In NA-215 Mithi, PPP’s Mahesh Kumar Malani, who secured victory in the general elections 2018, faces Arbab Ghulam Rahim, a prominent leader of the GDA and former chief minister of Sindh. Local analysts believe Malani, with Hindu voter dominance, is well-positioned to defeat his archrival.
""Malani is a public figure and knows how to maintain a strong connection with the masses,"" Sajid Bajeer, a journalist based in Mithi, said.In Mirpur Khas’s PS-45, Seth Hari Ram Kishori holds a favourable position despite contending against a Muslim candidate from an upper caste – Syed.
Senior journalist Muhammad Hasham Shar from Mirpur Khas commented: ""Despite the other candidate being Syed, Kishori is in a winning position."" He said that the competition among both is interesting as well.
In another Hindu-majority district Umerkot, former PTI National Assembly member Lal Malhi, now vying for the general seat from NA-213, faces stiff competition from PPP’s Nawab Muhammad Yousuf Talpur.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Malhi expresses optimism, stating, ""This constituency is Hindu majority, and I hope to win this seat.""Interestingly, PTI has emulated PPP by nominating candidates from lower castes, including Lekhraj from PS-50, Pehlaj Kolhi from PS-53, Lajpat Bheel from PS-54, and Bhanji Kolhi from PS-55.
Malhi emphasized the importance of political party backing for candidates, stating that: ""a candidate without a political party’s support cannot win a seat.""
In contrast, the major political party PML-N has not nominated any candidates for general seats, citing its direct support for the Grand Democratic Alliance as one of the reasons.
However, Kheeal Das Kohistani, a senior leader and former MNA, clarified that PML-N has recommended candidates from lower castes for reserved seats.Neelam Kumari represents women on the reserved seat in the National Assembly, he said.
Kohistani highlighted that PML-N interviewed 118 non-Muslim candidates, claiming that the selection process was based on pure merit. ""We have given due space to those who were ignored in the past [by any political party],"" he maintained.
Political analyst Ashfaq Laghari views the inclusion of lower-caste Hindus in the 2024 general elections as a positive development. He commended PPP’s Krishna Kumari, a rights activist and Senator since 2018, for serving as a source of inspiration and symbolising inclusivity.
Educationist Partab Shivani attributes this progress to increased awareness, emphasizing that despite the reluctance of upper-caste Hindus, the presence of lower-caste Hindus in parliament is essential. Shivani noted that Hindus reside not only in the Mirpur Khas division but also in significant numbers in Badin, Ghotki, Jamshoro district, and Karachi.
Political and social activist Mukesh Meghwar highlighted the challenges faced by Hindus in securing general seats, stating that political parties are hesitant to allocate these seats to Hindus due to the anticipated lack of support from Muslim voters.
""Muslims will not support if a Hindu is given a chance by a political party, and parties are well aware of this fact.""
The analysts believe that the 2024 general elections in Pakistan mark a positive shift with lower-caste Hindus gaining representation in general seats, challenging stereotypes, and contributing to a more inclusive political landscape.

2,Pakistan urges ICJ Gaza ruling’s full compliance,"Foreign Office calls for unconditional ceasefire, UNSC role in mitigating the crisis","Pakistan on Thursday called for full implementation of the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) provisional judgment on Gaza, requiring an immediate and unconditional ceasefire and urged the United Nation Security Council to play its mandated role on the crisis.
At her weekly press briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch expressed deep concerns over the ongoing oppression of Palestinian people and condemned an Israeli attack inside the Ibn Sina Hospital in Jenin which, she said, fell in the category of war crimes.
“Pakistan also calls for the full implementation of ICJ’s provisional judgment to uphold human rights, dignity, and identity of the Palestinian people as per the UN Charter, relevant resolutions, and international law,” Baloch said.
“The implementation of these provisional measures requires an immediate and unconditional ceasefire to bring about an end to the suffering faced by the people of Gaza,” she said. “These ongoing atrocities go against the spirit of the provisional measures decided by the ICJ to protect the people of Gaza.”
Baloch stressed that the suspension of funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) also went against the spirit of the ICJ's provisional measures. She called for reconsidering the decision of suspending the UNRWA funding.
The spokesperson said that on February 5, the government and the people of Pakistan would observe the Kashmir Solidarity Day to reaffirm their solidarity with the Kashmiri people in their just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination.
""Pakistan will continue to extend political, diplomatic and moral support to our Kashmiri brothers and sisters for the just and peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolutions,"" the spokesperson reiterated.
Baloch said that Caretaker Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani attended the Third European Union (EU)-Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum in Brussels, where he also held bilateral meetings with a number of EU officials. Jilani, she added, will also attend a session on ‘Economic Resilience and Investment’.
She informed the media persons that Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian visited Islamabad on January 29 and held in-depth talks with Foreign Minister Jilani, and met with Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir.
The two sides agreed to immediately appoint liaison officers in Turbat and Zahedan, besides establishing a joint coordination mechanism at the foreign ministers level to oversee and steer progress on a common agenda for prosperity and development, she added.
Baloch reiterated that Pakistan shared credible evidence linking Indian agents to extra-territorial and extra-judicial killings of two Pakistani nationals on the Pakistani soil, which contained striking similarities with the pattern observed in other countries, including Canada and the United States.
As part of a proactive diplomacy and deepening engagement with Small Island Developing States, the spokesperson said, Pakistan formally established diplomatic relations with St Kitts & Nevis in the Caribbean and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific.

3,Retired judges in the hot seat,"Govt is urging SC to revisit its previous order, shielding retired or resigned judges from action by SJC","Retired judges, once aligned with the camp of former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Mian Saqib Nisar, now face a precarious situation as the federal government is urging the Supreme Court to revisit its previous order, which shielded retired or resigned judges from action by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
The judicial politics has been buzzing with activity ever since the filing of the presidential reference against the current CJP, Qazi Faez Isa, back in May 2019.In attempts to unseat CJ Isa, a faction of judges made not one but two determined efforts, yet they fell short, and Justice Isa emerged unscathed.
Nevertheless, this intense legal tussle has resulted in a clear division among judges, aligning themselves into two distinct camps.At the forefront of this divide was the group led by CJP Saqib Nisar, which was in the driving seat in the superior judiciary until the retirement of the former CJP, Umar Ata Bandial.
The landscape shifted as judges who weathered the storm with CJ Isa are now at the helm.The tides turned dramatically for ex-CJP Saqib Nisar's camp, facing a significant setback when judges Justice Ijazul Ahsan and retired Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi tendered their resignations.As the SJC, led by CJ Qazi Faez Isa, was poised to act against Justice Naqvi following his resignation, Attorney General for Pakistan, Mansoor Awan, announced the government's intent to file an intra-court appeal (ICA) against a prior decision that said the SJC could not proceed against resigned or retired judges.
The judgement, authored by Justice Munib Akhtar, was handed down during the tenure of the ex-CJP Umar Ata Bandial.Recently, the government, through the AGP, filed an ICA against the division bench.
The appeal was heard by a larger bench of five judges, presided over by Justice Aminuddin Khan on Wednesday. The bench is set to decide on the maintainability of the ICA within the next two weeks.
It is noteworthy that the Independent Group, which holds sway in the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), also aligns itself closely with CJP Isa, PML-N, PPP and ‘powerful circles’.
Therefore, the superior bars, under the Independent Group, are not supporting the PTI in the current political climate. Notably, this legal faction backs every move made by CJP Isa during his tenure. They had filed complaints of misconduct against Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar in SJC.
When the media buzzed with criticism of the three-judge bench led by CJP Isa's January 13 order on the illegality of PTI intra-party elections, both superior bar representatives demanded government action against those allegedly tarnishing the image of SC judges via a campaign.
In response, the government notified a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to probe the matter, summoning dozens of journalists, including senior court reporters. However, the court reporters express disappointment over the bench's response to JIT notices.
The government, in tandem with powerful circles, will wholeheartedly endorse CJP Isa's decisions regarding the accountability of retired judges. If the apex court greenlights the government's ICA, retired judges aligned with ex-CJP Saqib Nisar could face the heat from the SJC led by CJP Isa.The government's support for CJP Isa has not gone unnoticed.
The executive is content with the fact that, unlike in the past, PTI has not secured relief from the SC during CJP Isa's tenure. An ideal relationship has been observed among the government, judiciary, and the bar since September of last year.
If they remain on the same page, sets the stage for potential trouble for social media activists and retired judges. However, the larger bench may reject the government’s ICA.
It is pertinent to note that in an unprecedented move during CJP Qazi Faez Isa's tenure, the conduct of retired CJs has become a subject of open court discussions.
During the hearing of petitions against the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act 2023, CJP Isa questioned the judgment of ex-CJP Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry in the Reko Diq case, which led to a multi-billion-dollar fine for the country. However, during the proceedings, Justice Munib Akhtar expressed reservations about scrutinising the conduct of retired CJPs.
Similarly, when review petitions against the Faizabad dharna judgement were taken up, CJP Isa had expressed bewilderment about why these review petitions had not been addressed in the past four years.
In a recent development, Chief Justice Isa expressed astonishment at the prolonged delay in deciding the elections matter of former deputy speaker of the National Assembly, Qasim Suri, which remained unresolved for four years.
Former CJP Bandial had granted a stay in Suri's favour after he was disqualified by the election tribunal. The bench, headed by CJP Isa, subsequently summoned Suri to address this matter.
PBC member Muneer Kakar, affiliated with the Professional Lawyers Group, has strongly condemned the demand made by SCBA and PBC representatives for action against social media activists critical of CJP Isa.
He has questioned why the Independent Group remained silent when judges were being ridiculed during the tenure of ex-CJP Bandial, adding that the bar's approach should not be selective.
As members of the Professional Group, we will strongly react to the formation of JIT and the issuance of notices to court reporters who criticised the January 13 order, he added.

4,"Pakistan, China discuss Afghan peace",China’s special envoy meets officials in Islamabad,"Days after China formally accepted a full time Ambassador of Afghanistan under the Taliban regime, President Xi Jinping’s close aide travelled to Islamabad on Friday apparently to take Pakistan into confidence.
The Chinese president earlier this week accepted the credentials of Bilal Karimi, a Taliban-appointed ambassador to China. The move was seen as tantamount to recognition of the Afghan Taliban government by Beijing.
No country has yet officially recognised the Taliban government since they returned to power in August 2021. But China became the first country to accept its full-time ambassador.
Though China has not clarified, diplomatic sources and observers believe that the move was a “tacit recognition” of the Afghan Taliban government, which is, otherwise, struggling to convince even neighbours for recognition let alone the Western countries.
Following the development, Chinese Special Envoy on Afghanistan Ambassador Yue Xiaonyoung held meetings with Pakistani authorities, including Foreign Secretary Cyrus Qazi and Additional Foreign Secretary, Afghanistan and West Asia, Ambassador Rahim Hayat Qureshi.
A statement issued by the Foreign Office said that both sides underscored their commitment to a peaceful and stable Afghanistan and emphasised the need for enhanced coordination for regional stability. “They also underlined the crucial role of neighbouring countries of Afghanistan for a peaceful, stable and prosperous region,” it added.

No further details were provided but sources said that the current Chinese move was also part of the discussions. China took Pakistan into confidence about its decision.
The sources said that China apparently took a “solo flight” in a disregard to the regional countries’ earlier understanding. They added that regional countries, particularly the immediate neighbours of Afghanistan, decided that the decision to recognise the Taliban government would be taken with consensus and collectively.
But, the sources continued, China’s close engagement with Taliban government could enhance its leverage that might help Pakistan in the long-run. China might have accepted a full time Taliban ambassador but the sources said that its concerns regarding Afghanistan being used by terrorist outfits remained.
China is particularly worried about the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which Beijing considers a terrorist outfit, activities in Afghanistan. A recent UN Monitoring Team report revealed that the Afghan Taliban relocated ETIM from Badakhashan to Baghlan province.
Also read: Has China formally recognised Taliban govt in Afghanistan?
However, the report noted that the ETIM was active in various parts of Afghanistan and busy recruiting young people. That was the reason that Chinese move to inch a step closer to recognise Taliban came as a surprise for many, including Pakistan.
The international community has set certain benchmarks before the Taliban were recognised. Those benchmarks include the inclusive government, permission for girls to go to school and women for work and on top of it no terrorist group would be allowed to operate from Afghan soil.
But it seems major players have adopted a more pragmatic approach compelled by their respective strategic interests. The US is also cautiously exploring the possibility of reopening its consulate in Kabul, according to the new strategy approved by the State Department.
The US, however, clarified that reopening the diplomatic mission in Kabul did not mean the recognition of the Taliban government.
The State Department, in its strategy, stuck to Washington’s demands that the Afghan Taliban would have to fulfil commitments, including formation of inclusive government, allowing girls education, women to work and not allow Afghan soil to be used against by terrorist groups and pose a threat to US and its allies.

5,PBS plans seventh agricultural census,"This will be first digital agricultural census, in which modern technology will be used","The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) has started planning for the seventh agricultural census as it held a meeting in Karachi to discuss various related issues, including timelines, initial activities, use of digital technology and the role of provinces in this regard.
This will be the first digital agricultural census, in which modern technology will be used.
The statistics will provide a comprehensive picture of the agricultural economy.
The meeting was informed that the field operation of the census would be completed with the cooperation of the provinces.
Chief Statistician Dr Naeemul Zafar chaired the meeting to apprise the district administrations of their role in the field operation.
Officials from the livestock department, Crop Reporting Service Centre, Board of Revenue (BoR) and Agriculture Extension participated in the meeting.
The meeting was informed that the PBS was responsible for planning, data processing, and preparation of census reports.
Dr Zafar said that the purpose of the meeting was to inform local governments about their role and get their cooperation for provision of updated information about the census activity.

6,Prices of 146 life-saving drugs hiked,Federal cabinet’s move compelled by ‘rising rates of raw material in global market’," 
In a major blow to the inflation-hit people of the country, the caretaker federal government on Thursday increased the prices of 146 life-saving medicines.
A federal cabinet meeting, chaired by interim Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar, gave its nod to the move under the hardship category on the recommendation of the national health services ministry, which informed the huddle about the rising prices of raw material for preparing the medicines in the global market.
The national health services ministry and Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) told the meeting that citizens could file complaints about the unavailability of medicines in the market through the pharmaceutical industry regulator’s online portal.
Speaking to the participants of the meeting, the interim premier said the caretaker government was taking all possible steps to provide medicines to the common man at reasonable prices.
He added that the interim government was framing policies that would benefit the common man and also develop the pharmaceutical industry.
Kakar directed that suggestions should be made to further improve the performance of Drap.
He also ordered that action against the trafficking and hoarding of medicines should be accelerated.
The interim premier further directed that suggestions should be forwarded to prepare a draft summary for legislation by the next elected parliament for the deregulation of medicine prices.
A shortage of several life-saving drugs across the country has paved the way for smuggled medicines in the market.
Patients have no option but purchase the essential medicines at much higher prices than their actual rates.
The crisis hit the country after caretaker Health Minister Dr Nadeem Jan turned down the proposed prices of 262 drugs that were approved by Drap under its policy in Nov 2022, saying that matter would be decided by the next elected government.
The Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) described the decision as “disastrous” for the medicine industry.
The federal cabinet, on the recommendation of the finance ministry, approved the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Competition Commission of Pakistan and China’s State Administration for Market Regulation.
Under the MoU, the exchange of information and technical capabilities between the two countries will increase.
The federal cabinet also allowed Pakistani psychologist Dr Muhammad Saleem Khan Tareen to receive the award of Member of the British Empire by UK King Charles III for his services in his field.
The cabinet further granted permission to Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu to receive the Gold Medal for Aeronautical Merit from Italy.
The Italian government conferred this medal in recognition of his services for enhancing cooperation between the air forces of the two countries.

7,LHC judge tenders resignation,Third resignation in a month raises eyebrows,"The buzz around judicial resignations continued on Friday, with another judge from the superior judiciary throwing in the towel, marking the third such departure within a month during Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa's tenure.
Under the watchful eye of CJP Isa, the resignation tally has reached three, with two from from the Supreme Court and the latest one hitting the Lahore High Court (LHC).
Justice Shahid Jameel Khan, performing at the LHC bench since 2014, decided to step down, adding to the recent exits of Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, both SC judges.
Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Justice Shahid Jamil Khan on Friday tendered his resignation from his office, citing “personal circumstances” in which he had decided to “turn the page and start a new chapter”.
""I Justice Shahid Jamil Khan, after having served as a Judge of [the] Lahore High Court, Lahore for about 10 years, hereby exercise the option to resign under Article 206(1) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973, with immediate effect,"" read his resignation letter, which he has reportedly sent to President Dr Arif Alvi.
“It was an absolute honour to hold the office, but for personal circumstances I have decided to turn the page and start a new chapter,” the letter added.
The judge also added an old proverb “An ounce of discretion is worth a pound of wit” in the letter – that means that being discreet and thoughtful in your actions can have greater value and long-term benefits in comparison with relying solely on cleverness.
Justice Shahid Jamil also drew inspiration from the poetry of Allama Iqbal, incorporating verses into his resignation letter.
Reflecting on the disparity between freedom and servitude, he highlighted the importance of enlightened thinking for those who seek true liberty.
“Azad Ki Ek Aan Ha Mehkoom Ka Ek Saal, Kis Darja Garan Sair Hain Mehkoom Ke Auqat! [A free manʹs breath can match a subject year, How slowly moves the time of serfs, is clear!] Azad Ka Andesha Haqiqat Se Munawar, Mehkoom Ka Andesha Giraftar-e-Khurafat [The thoughts of persons free with truth are lit, But the thoughts of slaves do not own sense a bit] Mehkoom Ko Peeron Ki Karamat Ka Soda, Hai Banda-e-Azad Khud Ek Zinda Karamat [A slave has craze for marvels wrought by guides, Himself a wonder live, his memory fresh abides] Iqbal! Yahan Naam Na Le Ilm-e-Khudi Ka,
Mozoon Nahin Maktab Ke Liye Aese Maqalat [Iqbal! Don’t talk about the self here, As such sermons are not suitable for schools],” he wrote.
However, sources said that the reasons behind the resignation of the two apex court’s judges differ from the resignation of the LHC judge. There is no apparent nexus between the LHC judge's resignation and the resignations of the other two judges.
When Shahid Jameel Khan contemplated resigning shortly after Ijazul Ahsan's resignation, he was advised to hold off for a couple of weeks, steering clear of creating the impression of a continuous string of resignations.
Shahid Jameel Khan had already decided to submit his resignation, aiming to begin a career in legal practice after serving as an LHC judge for a decade. Despite having the option to serve four more years, he chose to step down.
Ranking as the 11th most senior judge at the LHC, he was known for his expertise in tax matters. He was close to ex-CJP Umar Ata Bandial.
Meanwhile, sources told The Express Tribune that his disappointment over not being assigned constitutional cases might have played a role in his decision. The situation might have seen a shift following the retirement of the incumbent LHC chief justice, but the judge did not wait to see any changes in this regard.
Senior lawyers point out that adding complexity to the situation is the mention of Urdu poetry in Shahid Jameel Khan's resignation letter.
Some who are displeased with CJP Isa's judicial decisions are attributing the LHC judge’s resignation to the current political climate, where the judiciary faces criticism for not providing relief to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
While some lawyers demand an inquiry into the reasons behind the resignation of Ijazul Ahsan, others point to elements of judicial politics at play amid swirling speculations and rumours.
At a superior bars event on Thursday, CJP Isa expressed his astonishment upon learning about Justice Ijazul Ahsan's resignation.
It has been reported that the vice chairman of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) raised concerns about the credibility of LHC judges during his speech.
The superior bars, led by the Independent Group, filed complaints of misconduct against Justice (retired) Naqvi. There is a pressing need for an inquiry to delve into the reasons behind the resignations of the three judges.
