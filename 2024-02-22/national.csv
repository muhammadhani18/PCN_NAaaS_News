0,Karachi business leaders urge Safe City project,"Highlight importance of enhanced security measures to attract investment, restore confidence","Business leaders in Karachi highlighted the critical role of the Safe City project in revitalising business activity and restoring investor confidence in the city, which serves as the economic engine of Pakistan.
They argue that the implementation of a safe city initiative in Karachi holds the promise of transforming the city into a secure and business-friendly environment, akin to the success witnessed in global business hubs like Singapore. Renowned for its robust security measures and advanced surveillance technology, Singapore has become a magnet for foreign investments and multinational corporations, setting a precedent for the economic benefits of enhanced safety measures.
SI Global Solutions CEO, Noman Said highlighted the potential transformative impact of the Safe City project on Karachi’s business landscape, drawing parallels with Singapore’s success. He stresses that improved surveillance and law enforcement capabilities are expected to reduce crime rates and create a safer environment for businesses and investors. This enhanced security is crucial for attracting foreign investment, which prioritises safety in decision-making.
Moreover, Said points out that the project could elevate Karachi’s status as a venue for international cricket events, such as the Pakistan Super League (PSL), thereby boosting sports tourism and enhancing the city’s global reputation. Eminent industrialist Riaz Uddin criticised the Sindh government for its perceived reluctance in making Karachi a safe city, despite its status as Pakistan’s economic hub. He underscored the dissatisfaction among Karachiites with the city’s safety and liveability, compared to other cities like Islamabad and Lahore.
Liaquat Ali, another business leader, underscored the exodus of residents from Karachi due to safety concerns, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced security measures.
Despite these challenges, progress is underway, with the Karachi Safe City (KSC) project set to launch in the coming month. Divided into five phases, the project will encompass key areas of the city and involve the installation of state-of-the-art surveillance cameras monitored by control rooms.
Pakistan Stock Exchange Director and former chief of the CPLC Karachi, Ahmed Chinoy reiterated the importance of safety and security in instilling confidence among businessmen and citizens. He acknowledged the persistent challenge of street crimes in Karachi but underscored the necessity of the Safe City project in addressing these issues effectively.
An anonymous senior police officer underscored the need for advanced surveillance technology, including facial recognition and artificial intelligence, to combat street crimes effectively. He cited the success of similar projects in cities like London and Lahore, stressing the importance of scaling up surveillance infrastructure to meet the demands of Karachi’s urban landscape.
He noted that Karachi currently has approximately 2,200 traditional cameras installed, but even with the installation of 10,000 cameras, it would not suffice for such a large city. Stressing the need for advanced surveillance technology, he advocated for the installation of cameras equipped with facial recognition and artificial intelligence capabilities. This, he explained, would enable swift detection of street criminals by cross-referencing their images with databases such as NADRA’s, facilitating their immediate apprehension.

1,Businessmen seek changes to Af-Pak Transit Trade Agreement,Urges amendments to APTTA 2010 for better trade relations,"Businessmen dealing in Pak-Afghan trade have suggested amendments to the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) 2010 through consultation with stakeholders. These suggestions were made during the visit of a delegation of businessmen, led by Coordinator Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI) Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, to the office of Director General Transit Trade, Wajid Ali.

Speaking on the occasion, Sarhadi said APTTA 2010 has several lacuna as a result of which 70% of transit trade has been shifted from Karachi port to Bandar Abbas in Iran. He demanded the revival of Goods in Transit to Afghanistan (GITA) service through lost cargo via train between Peshawar to Karachi and from Karachi to Chaman. For this purpose, he urged for SRO 121 to be repealed in order to allow GITA services through containers and lost cargo as well.

Sarhadi added that in October 2023, the Ministry of Commerce through issuing SRO 1380 imposed a ban on 14 items of Afghan transit trade, which in a larger context constitute around 212 items, besides enforcement of a 100% bank guarantee. He said the cargo goods were already covered under insurance guarantee and had been going safely to Afghanistan for the last 13 years. He demanded the revocation of a 100% bank guarantee and the revival of the old insurance guarantee system.

He added that hundreds of trucks are illegally bringing different items including petroleum production, and food items from Iran daily which needed to be stopped. The measures taken for imposition of restriction on Pak-Afghan transit trade are hurting commerce in the region, he opined.

Sarhadi also shared data on Pak-Afghan trade and mentioned a decline in volume during the last several years, a reduction to $1,400 million.

Both the countries, he continued, have set the target of increasing trade volume to $5 billion which in prevailing circumstances looks impossible. APP

2,PSX soars as political gridlock breaks,"KSE-100 index soars over 1000 points, settles at 61,559.15","The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) bounced back on Wednesday, making a U-shaped recovery and erasing losses as the resolution of internal political concerns spurred investor interest following an agreement to form a government.
Earlier, trading kicked off with minor ups and downs, but somber sentiment kept the KSE-100 index activity dull for most of the day.
An arrangement for power-sharing to set up a fresh government rejuvenated investor interest in the bourse and triggered a rally, with the index touching an intraday high of 61,620.85.
Gains were also accelerated by rolling Pakistan Eurobonds on the favourable political developments and an uptrend in the rupee value. Strong earnings in the banking sector further lifted the market.
With the revival of investor interest, the market skyrocketed over 1000 points to close the day above the 61,500-point mark.
“Stocks closed bullish after a consensus over the power-sharing deal to form a new government and upbeat data on the trade deficit falling by 32.7% YoY to $13.16 billion for July-Jan’24,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Reports of a reduction in NSC rates, surging Pakistan Eurobonds on the formation of a coalition government played a catalyst role in the bullish close”.
At the close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a significant gain of 1094.91 points, or 1.81%, settling at 61,559.15.
Topline Securities noted that the index maintained a positive trend throughout the day.
The market optimism stemmed from the recent consensus among major political parties to form a coalition government, it said.
This upward movement was driven by Oil & Gas Development Company, Lucky Cement, Pakistan Petroleum, United Bank, and TRG Pakistan, collectively contributing to an additional 322 points on the index.

Arif Habib Limited (AHL) observed in its report that “following an agreement to form a government following almost 2-weeks of deadlock, the KSE-100 rallied to close near the high of the day and +1.81% day-on-day”.
United Bank announced its 4QCY23 earnings per share (EPS) of Rs11.0, +3% YoY along with a dividend per share (DPS) of Rs11/share, with main drivers being a jump in interest income and provision reversal.
While Askari Bank reported 4QCY23 EPS of Rs4.78, +108% YoY along with DPS of Rs2.5/share, with main drivers being growth in total income.
“Strong Tuesday session now sets up a test of 62,000 which is the first hurdle that needs to be crossed to indicate a tradable bounce is underway towards 64,000,” AHL added.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal noted that the market welcomed clarity on the political front regarding government formation both at the federal and provincial levels.
“We recommend investors to avail any downside as an opportunity to buy in the banking and E&P sectors,” the JS analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 362.7 million shares against Tuesday’s tally of 364.4 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs12.5 billion.
Shares of 347 companies were traded, with 242 stocks closing higher, 84 dropping, and 21 remaining unchanged.
Bank of Punjab led in volume with trading in 35.4 million shares, losing Rs0.03 to close at Rs6.24. It was followed by K-Electric with 28.6 million shares, gaining Rs0.04 to close at Rs4.30, and WorldCall Telecom with 21.4 million shares, gaining Rs0.08 to close at Rs1.29.

3,Rupee rises amid political stability,"Regains Rs0.07, reaches Rs279.50/$ at interbank market","The Pakistani currency resumed its uptrend after a day of nominal losses, partially regaining to Rs279.50 against the US dollar in the interbank market on Wednesday amid the beginning of the end of the political crisis over the formation of the government in the centre.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the domestic currency regained 0.02% or Rs0.07 against the greenback on a day-to-day basis.
In total, the local currency has increased by 9.87% or Rs27.60 over the past five months to date compared to its record low closing at Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023.
Market talks suggest that the supply of foreign currencies has remained higher than demand in the interbank market. A report suggests an uptrend in export earnings in the first 15 days of the ongoing month of February. Moreover, overseas Pakistanis are believed to be sending higher workers’ remittances to their family members and friends these days ahead of the beginning of Ramazan in the second week of March 2024.
However, the currency in the open market extended its losses for the ninth consecutive working day, falling by 0.04% or Rs0.12 on a day-to-day basis to close at Rs282.44/$.

Read Rupee falls to 3-week low against dollar
The currency has cumulatively dropped by Rs1.43 in the open market in the past nine days.
Dealers at the open market said the drop is recorded following a demand for foreign currencies up by 10% for purchase by Hajj and Umrah pilgrims these days compared to the pre-election days that were held on February 8 in the country.
Accordingly, the disparity in the value of the rupee between the two markets further widened to Rs2.94 (or 1.05%) at present, gradually approaching the IMF recommended maximum limit of 1.25% (around Rs4 at current levels). If the spread continues to widen, then either the currency has to appreciate in the open market or depreciate in the interbank market to reduce the widening.
Earlier, the disparity had spiked to Rs30-40 by the first week of September 2023, resulting in high volatility in the local currency in both markets.

4,PAAPAM decries proposed sales tax hike,Says increases from 18% to 25% could escalate car prices to over Rs4 million,"The Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM) has sounded the alarm over the government’s proposed increase in sales tax on automobiles from 18% to 25%, warning that such a move could drastically escalate car prices to as high as Rs4 million or above.
Speaking in unison, PAAPAM’s leadership, including Chairman Abdul Rahman Aizaz, SCV Mumsahd Ali, and VC Taufique Sherwani, voiced grave concerns, citing that previous tax hikes, currency devaluation, and other economic factors have already led to a substantial decline in automobile sales, plummeting to just 30% of 2021-22 levels. This downturn has not only strained the automotive manufacturing sector and curtailed job opportunities but has also resulted in diminished tax revenue from the industry.
Highlighting the prevailing challenges such as surging energy costs, a staggering currency devaluation of over 160% within six years, exorbitantly high financing rates, and a tax burden exceeding 40% on each vehicle sold, PAAPAM officials underscored that current sales have dwindled to a mere 100,000 cars and SUVs, significantly below the installed capacity of 500,000 vehicles.
They noted that the automotive sector has been on a downward trajectory for the past five years, and any further price hikes, particularly due to increased taxes, would only exacerbate the decline in sales. Highlighting the elasticity of automobile demand, they warned that higher prices resulting from a GST hike would likely dampen consumer sentiment and erode investor confidence in Pakistan’s market, compounding the existing challenges of hyperinflation and economic slowdown.

Read Auto industry seeks growth via diversification
Expressing surprise over the government’s decision to leave taxes unchanged on imported used cars, PAAPAM leaders argued that this policy discrepancy provides negative protection to locally manufactured vehicles, allowing used cars to dominate the market at the expense of domestic production, highlighting the detrimental impact of this trend on foreign exchange reserves and government revenue.
They reiterated that the Economic Coordination Committee’s decision to increase the GST to 25% on locally produced vehicles, of 1,400cc and above, will result both in a drop in volumes as well as revenues.
The association urged authorities to refrain from burdening the local automotive industry with further tax increases, explaining that raising the GST to 25% for small-sized sedans would render them unaffordable for the middle class and result in reduced tax collection due to decreased sales. They called for constructive dialogue with the government before implementing any additional taxes on automobiles, noting that a similar proposal had been rejected during previous discussions with industry stakeholders.
Meanwhile, data from the Pakistan Automobile Manufacturing Association (PAMA) revealed a 12.33% decrease in the sale of motorbikes and three-wheelers during the first seven months of the current fiscal year (2023-24) compared to the same period last year. While certain brands experienced growth, overall sales declined, signalling ongoing challenges in the automotive market.

5,"Edible oil, sugar imports drop","Exports increased 7.89%, imports declined 14.11% during July-January (2023-24)","Edible oil including soyabean and palm imports into the country during the first seven months of the current financial year decreased by 49.85% and 34.14% respectively as compared to the imports of the corresponding period of last year.

6,Ineligible hiring at Exim bank,Officials say incumbent CEO did not meet eligibility criteria at time of appointment,"The federal government has decided to hire a new head of Pakistan’s Export-Import (Exim) bank amid a disclosure of discrepancy in the age of the incumbent president, which should have made him ineligible for the appointment four years ago.
Sources in the Ministry of Finance told The Express Tribune that a decision has been made to expedite the process for the appointment of the chief executive officer and the president of the Exim Bank of Pakistan. This decision was taken after it surfaced that the incumbent chief executive did not meet the eligibility criteria at the time of his appointment in December 2019, according to officials.
In July last year, the federal cabinet had extended the tenure of the chief executive of the Exim Bank for a period of six months or until a new appointment, whichever is later. But the Ministry of Finance was now considering stopping the president from attending the office, said the sources.
The advertisement for the appointment of the CEO of EXIM Bank had been published in newspapers in May 2019. The age limit was kept at 55, as shown in the advertisement.
The Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of Pakistan records showed that there was a clear discrepancy in the age record mentioned in two different passports. The president, Syed Irfran Bukhari, is a dual national, holding both Canadian and Pakistani nationalities, the Ministry of Finance confirmed to The Express Tribune.
In December 2019, the Ministry of Finance issued the notification for the appointment of Bukhari as the head of the bank, subject to clearance by the central bank.
The documents showed that the central bank highlighted the “discrepancy” in the age of the candidate in a letter sent to the Ministry of Finance in February 2020.
“While assessing the fitness and propriety of Irfan Bukhari for the subject position, a discrepancy in his date of birth has been noted. In the National Identity Card Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP), the date of birth is 08-05-1964, whereas in the Canadian passport and FPT Proforma, his date of birth is 08-05-1962,” according to the SBP letter to the finance ministry.
The central bank clearly told the finance ministry that his age was above the eligibility criterion and “in contradiction with the job advertisement wherein the maximum age requirement for the position is 55 years”.
The central bank advised the ministry to reassess Bukhari’s eligibility. However, despite these contradictions, the ministry secured an extension in Bukhari’s tenure in July last year.
When contacted, the Spokesperson for the Finance Ministry, Qamar Abbasi, confirmed that Bukhari was a dual national holding Pakistani and Canadian nationalities.
The spokesman said that at the time of the appointment, as per the record of the NICOP, the president was 54 years and 11 months old. Abbasi said that Bukhari was shortlisted on the basis of his date of birth as mentioned in NICOP, which was cross-verified from NADRA.

Read EXIM to become operational soon
But the documents suggested that Bukhari started the process of preparing documents to meet the age limit criteria after his selection.
The date of birth on his Canadian passport was May 8, 1962, which he obtained in August 2019. This made him ineligible for the post.
However, the Pakistani passport was issued on January 13, 2020 – weeks after his notification from the Exim Bank president, and mentioned the date of birth as May 8, 1964.
The finance ministry spokesman said a committee comprising the additional secretary internal finance, additional secretary establishment, and additional finance secretary human resource had shortlisted the candidates.
Abbasi said that a selection committee comprising the then finance minister, then Minister for Commerce, former Prime Minister’s Advisor on Institutional Reforms & Austerity, then secretary finance, then secretary establishment, and the then additional secretary Finance Division had finalised his name.
The spokesman further said that as required for such appointments, the SBP assessed the proposed appointment on the basis of its prescribed Fit Proper Test and cleared it.
But the record showed that the central bank had highlighted the age discrepancy.
Pakistan has established the Exim bank as a Development Finance Institution and it is fully owned by the federal government. The Exim bank’s mandate is to promote exports and to support the implementation of import-substitution projects.
The sources said that the Ministry of Finance at that time had sought clarification from Bukhari after the central bank objection. Four years ago, the president had assured that he would get the record corrected with Canadian authorities and with provincial authorities of Punjab, according to the sources. But subsequently there was no follow-up on the issue. The spokesman said that the federal cabinet had approved the reappointment of Bukhari on the recommendation of the Finance Division in July last year.

7,Balanced pharma regulations sought,Punjab governor says strict regulations carry risk of companies departing,"Punjab Governor Muhammad Balighur Rehman, addressing media at the inauguration of the two-day Pak Pharma and Healthcare Expo at Lahore’s Expo Centre, underscored the importance of a balanced regulatory framework for the pharmaceutical industry, according to a statement release on Wednesday.
He stressed that while the caretaker government’s initiative to deregulate medicine prices was commendable, regulations should not be overly stringent, risking the departure of pharmaceutical companies from the industry.
According to the statement, the 16th Pak Pharma & Healthcare Exhibition & Conference (PPE) commenced with over 400 stalls and the participation of 100 foreign and local exhibitors. The event was organised by Prime Event Management with support from the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA).

Rehman highlighted the need for regulations that prevent the exploitation of patients while fostering a conducive environment for pharmaceutical companies to thrive. He also called for the prompt convening of the Punjab Assembly session to facilitate the formation of a new government, reaffirming the government’s commitment to constitutional duties.
Reflecting on past governmental actions, the governor commended the organisers for a successful expo, highlighting the significance of local production of pharmaceutical raw materials in driving sectoral growth and promoting technology and exports.
PPMA Chairman Mian Misbahur Rehman echoed the call for pharmaceutical pricing reforms, advocating for a transition towards a system aligned with WHO standards to ensure fair pricing and accessibility of medicines. Meanwhile, organiser Kamran Abbasi highlighted the expo’s exclusive focus on pharmaceutical equipment and healthcare essentials, offering a comprehensive platform for industry stakeholders to explore cutting-edge solutions and forge partnerships.

8,Govt restructures gas priority for industrial growth,"Residents, industries share first spot, power and fertiliser sectors in second category","The caretaker government has decided to change the gas priority order by placing the process industry at the top along with domestic consumers. It has also changed the priority order of the fertiliser sector by placing it in the second category along with the power sector.
Earlier, the fertiliser industry was placed in the third category. The export-oriented industry was placed in the second category in the old policy. However, the caretaker government has removed it from the second category and placed it in the fertiliser sector.
In the first category, the government had added domestic and commercial consumers, including tandoor and industry processing only. The power and fertiliser sectors have been placed in the second category, industry (captive power) in the third, cement in the fourth, and CNG in the fifth category.
Sources said that the issue was taken up before the prime minister. The Petroleum division had submitted a plan regarding the proposed revision in the gas priority order that was okayed. The issue was already taken up before the economic coordination committee (ECC) to change the gas priority order.
The members of the economic decision-making body had suggested amendments to the gas supply priority order with the objective of according top priority to the industry, which will help boost the industrialisation process in the country. Its members had argued that the merit order for gas supply had been distorted, as the domestic sector got first priority with no value addition. They underscored the need to amend the economic merit order by placing industries at the top, as they make value addition and bring revenue for the country.
It was pointed out that the government had already decided on the gas load management plan, wherein the provision of gas to domestic consumers would be ensured for eight hours a day during winter months. However, some policymakers warned against relegating residential consumers in the priority order cautioning against further reductions of gas supply.
Domestic consumers are given preference in gas supply owing to the implementation of parliamentarians’ schemes that are mainly undertaken for political considerations to win over voters. Such schemes are approved by each government to provide gas to villages, though the production of indigenous gas has not increased since the year 2000.

Read Gas price hike for fertiliser plants sought
Earlier, parliamentarians had been focusing on electricity supply projects, but its network has now expanded to the maximum level. Pakistan’s gas production is depleting by 9% every year, and the country has become dependent on imported gas for the past many years. With the execution of lawmakers’ projects, the gas pipeline network is expanding, while on the other hand, prices are also going up. Gas prices are linked with a guaranteed rate of return on assets. Therefore, the initiation of new schemes promises more incentives to the public gas utilities on account of an increase in prices. There are 72% retail consumers of gas, whereas 28% are bulk consumers like the power sector, industry, captive plants, and CNG stations.
In 2005, bulk consumers accounted for 70% of the total, whereas domestic consumers comprised 30%. However, the ratio has reversed with domestic consumers rising and bulk consumers dropping drastically. 
The reversal in the priority order has also led to an increase in gas losses and theft. In 2013, the average losses of gas utilities stood at 10%, which has now gone up to an average of 12%. Similarly, in the jurisdiction of Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), Balochistan has contributed 40% to the overall gas losses.
Industry officials say that mismanagement in the priority order has made the country a net importer of LNG, which has significantly added to circular debt. Earlier, the power sector was a key contributor to the debt pile.

9,Foreign bonds outperform peers,Rally as political deadlock ends; govt cuts profits on local saving products,"Pakistan’s US dollar-denominated Eurobonds and Sukuks staged an outstanding rally in global markets on Wednesday in the wake of ending the political deadlock over the formation of the government in the centre, outperforming emerging-market peers on the day.
According to the data compiled and reported by JS Global Research, Pakistan’s foreign bonds spiked in the range of 1-6% on the day, overcoming almost all the losses the bonds had recorded post-election upset in Pakistan.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Chase Securities Director of Research, Yousuf M Farooq, said the chances of the formation of the new political government have increased following a joint press conference on the subject by Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) top leadership, ending the two-week-long political crisis in the country.
“The development has given confidence to global investors that Pakistan will manage to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on time instead of getting delayed. This will ensure the nation repays the maturing foreign debt on time, going forward,” he said. To recall, Pakistan is to make a major debt repayment worth $1 billion against maturing a 10-year Eurobond two months later in mid-April 2024.
According to JS Global, Pakistan’s $300 million bond maturing in 2036 gained 6% in a day to 76.21 cents on the day, followed by the notes maturing in 2051 and 2031, which surged 5% each. The bonds maturing in 2026, 2027, and 2029 each increased by 4% on a day-to-day basis. The 2025 bond rose 2%. The bond worth $1 billion, maturing in April 2024, improved by 1%, nearing a record high at 98.40 cents on the day.
Global media outlet Bloomberg reported during the day that the notes maturing in 2031 climbed 3.6 cents to 68.2 cents on the dollar, nearly wiping out losses that followed the February 8 election. Other bonds maturing in 2027, 2029, 2051, 2026, and 2025 all advanced by similar margins. “Pakistan’s securities beat emerging-market peers on the day,” it reported.
Earlier, global rating agencies including Moody’s and Fitch Ratings said Pakistan approaching the IMF for the new loan programme, after the ongoing one worth $3 billion ends in March-April 2024, has become highly uncertain in the wake of the then high political crisis over making the next government. Goldman Sachs, the global investment bank, however, had expressed hope that the political crisis would end soon and enable the nation to approach the IMF almost on time.
Farooq further said that the political landscape has drastically changed over the past 24 hours. “Yesterday (Tuesday) there was high political uncertainty over the government formation. And today, the uncertainty has shifted into certainty.”

The new government is to work on a variety of economic issues in addition to securing an IMF loan programme. The other tough issues are increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio by increasing the number of taxpayers and rising collection of revenue in taxes by bringing new taxpayers into the tax net.
There is very limited fiscal space left with the government to do development work and support economic activities in the country. The increase in tax collection is a must. Moreover, the new government has to play its due role in controlling the stubborn inflation reading. The latest increase in gas prices in February will keep inflation reading elevated near and around 24% in February, he said.
The expectations are that the inflation rate will start coming down from March onwards. The new government also needs to play smart on the external economy. It needs to keep the current account deficit moderate and at the same time increase economic growth to create the required job opportunities in the country, he said.
NSS cuts rate
Topline Securities reported the government cut profit rates by 36-72 basis points on rupee-denominated local national saving products with effect from Wednesday (Feb 21).
The data suggest that the rate of return was cut by 72 basis points to 15.36% on each of the three bonds including Pensioners Benefit Account, Behbood Saving Certificate, and Shuhada Family Welfare Account. The profit rate reduced by 58 basis points to 19.76% on Short-Term Savings Certificates. The rate slashed by 55 basis points to 13.67% on Defence Savings Certificate.
Special Saving Certificate’s profit declined by 40 basis points to 15.60%. The rate on Regular Income Certificate dropped by 36 basis points to 14.64%.
The rates on Saving Account Rate, Sarwa Islamic Term Account, and Sarwa Islamic Saving Account remained unchanged at 20.50%, 18.54%, and 20.50%, respectively.
Chase Securities’ expert Farooq further said the government reinvests the investor money into Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), while the rate of return on the bonds has gone down notably in recent times.
Accordingly, the latest cut in the rate of profits on the saving products is made in line with the reduction in return on PIBs.
