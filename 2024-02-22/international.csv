0,PBS to launch 7th agricultural census,Reliable data to help policy formulations for K-P,"The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), guided by the principles outlined by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO), has embarked on a monumental task – the organization of the 7th Agricultural Census in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and its newly merged districts. This endeavor represents a significant step forward in integrating digital technology to streamline data collection processes across the agricultural, livestock, and agro-machinery sectors. Despite financial constraints, a substantial budget of Rs650 million has been allocated to ensure the success of this vital initiative, underscoring the government’s commitment to evidence-based policymaking in the agricultural domain.
At a special meeting convened at the Benevolent Fund Building in Peshawar, chaired by senior PBS member Muhammad Sarwar Gondal, the strategic importance of the agricultural census was underscored. It was emphasized that this comprehensive effort would not only provide crucial insights for policymakers but also serve as a benchmark for addressing the food and fiber needs of Pakistan’s burgeoning population, which currently stands at over 241 million.
One of the cornerstones of the census strategy is the adoption of a process re-engineering approach, drawing inspiration from the successful execution of the Covid census in 2019. This approach involves the development of large-scale agri holdings (NCH) and the implementation of innovative methodologies to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of data collection processes. 
Moreover, to facilitate seamless operations, 157 agricultural census support centers have been established in collaboration with provincial stakeholders, including the Board of Revenue, Agriculture Extension, Livestock, and the K-P Bureau of Statistics.

Recognizing the importance of widespread participation and awareness, extensive outreach efforts have been planned through various media channels, including print, electronic, and social media platforms. These efforts are aimed at engaging all segments of society and encouraging active involvement in this national endeavor.
Muhammad Sarwar Gondal, in his address, reiterated the significance of the census in informing evidence-based policy formulation. 
He emphasized the need for collaboration and cooperation from provincial stakeholders to ensure the successful execution of the census. Engagements with partner organizations and stakeholders are already underway to garner diverse perspectives and address potential challenges in data collection. 
A comprehensive methodology and field operation plan have been developed, incorporating newly developed sampling designs vetted by FAO. The integration of digital technologies, such as tablet-based data collection and SMS gateways, will not only enhance the efficiency of data gathering but also ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected information.
To support field operations, various working groups have been constituted to manage complaints and provide necessary information. Additionally, divisional and district census coordinators have been deployed to provide technical guidance and operational management at the grassroots level. To facilitate training, 157 venues equipped with multimedia facilities have been identified to ensure standardized training for field personnel.
The 7th Agricultural Census represents a critical milestone in Pakistan’s efforts to modernize its agricultural sector and inform evidence-based policymaking. The commitment of the PBS, in collaboration with provincial stakeholders, underscores the government’s dedication to addressing the evolving needs of the agricultural sector. Through effective utilization of resources and widespread engagement, the census aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Pakistan’s agricultural landscape, laying the foundation for informed policy interventions and sustainable development.

1,New hiring in MTI hospitals stopped,The backdrop to these decisions is the suspension of claims payment to public hospitals under the Sehat Card program,"The caretaker government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa has issued directives to halt the Board of Governors (BoGs) of all Medical Teaching Institute (MTI) Hospitals from making significant decisions, including new appointments. 
A letter from the advisor to the chief minister emphasized that BoGs must seek prior approval from the Health Department for major decisions.
This move echoes a previous directive issued on May 24 last year, which imposed a ban on all new recruitments by the BoGs of MTI hospitals.
The backdrop to these decisions is the suspension of claims payment to public sector hospitals under the Sehat Card program by the State Life Insurance Company. 
This suspension has had a profound impact on the revenue of public hospitals, including MTI hospitals in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. As a result, these hospitals have been facing financial constraints, struggling to procure essential medicines and provide free treatment to patients, particularly those covered under the Sehat Card program.
The insurance company’s stance underscores the gravity of the situation, as they insisted on the release of funds by the provincial government to settle outstanding dues, which, back then, amounted to approximately Rs30 billion. The company had specifically requested Rs10 billion from the provincial government to clear these dues. Failure to address this issue could lead to dire consequences, including the inability to pay healthcare providers and difficulties in securing vital supplies.
These financial challenges have had a cascading effect on consultants and healthcare providers, impacting their ability to deliver essential care to patients. For instance, Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC) was awaiting Rs900 million in claims, but payments had been halted by the insurance company. This financial strain had significantly hampered the capacity of healthcare facilities in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to ensure the provision of quality healthcare services to the public, posing serious challenges to the healthcare system.
