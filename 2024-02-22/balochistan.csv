0,No end in sight to young maid’s plight,Teenager fell victim to violence in Islamabad last summer,"A 15-year-old domestic worker who was subjected to violence in Islamabad last summer and remained hospitalised till December has been admitted to a hospital again for a surgery.
According to the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau (CPWB), Rizwana, the victim,
is currently undergoing treatment at Lahore General Hospital, where her arm will be operated upon.
The 15-year-old girl had been handed over to the CPWB on December 6 after several months of treatment at the Lahore General Hospital. However, she has once again been admitted to the hospital.
According to hospital management, Rizwana’s health is much better than before. A CPWB spokesman said that Rizwana was taken to Lahore General Hospital several times for routine check-ups, but earlier this week she complained about pain in her arm. 
She has since been admitted to the hospital, where her arm will be operated upon.
According to the authorities, in July last year, Rizwana was subjected to torture while working at the house of a civil judge named Asim in Islamabad. 
The accused severely tortured her, fracturing both her
arms and even attacking her with acid. 
On July 24 last year, Rizwana was taken to the District Headquarters Hospital in Sargodha in critical condition, reportedly with wounds on her face, head and body that were said to have been caused by a “blunt weapon”.

The girl also bore burn marks on her body. She was later shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the Lahore General Hospital, with doctors fearing for the teen’s life.
The Principal of Ameeruddin Medical College, Prof Al-Fareed Zafar, called an emergency meeting of a Special Medical Board and the members conducted a thorough medical examination of Rizwana.
The doctors believed the wounds were old, due to which the infection in blood had increased, and the complications affected some organs.
The medical board members told the media that the girl had an infection in her lungs, which was affecting her breathing.
In August, Rizwana successfully underwent plastic surgery at Lahore General Hospital. 
The principal of the medical institute confirmed this positive outcome in an official statement. 
The surgical procedure involved grafting to address wounds on both the victim’s cheeks and eye.
Professor Zafar underscored the complexity of wound cleaning and grafting procedures, highlighting their critical nature. 
He further elaborated on the high level of care and attention Rizwana was receiving, pointing out that she was being provided with top-tier medical facilities.
Round-the-clock medical support was being ensured through the dedicated efforts of doctors and nurses, he added.
He stressed the commitment to Rizwana’s well-being by emphasising regular communication with the authorities concerned regarding her progress.
Additionally, the head of the Medical Board, Professor Judat Saleem, detailed the comprehensive medical care Rizwana had received. 
Notably, the wounds on her head and back were thoroughly cleansed and sutured, leading to improvements in her platelet and blood levels.
