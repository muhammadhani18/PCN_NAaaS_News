0,JUI-F eyes a slice out of power pie,Maulana Haideri discusses alliance with Dar,"In an apparent change of heart, the Jamiat Ulema Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), after playing hardball and signalling its intention to embrace the opposition benches, on Wednesday appeared to be swallowing its own words, eyeing a slice out of the power pie in the upcoming coalition setup crafted by the PML-N and the PPP.
Seemingly singing a different tune, the party engaged in discussions with PML-N leaders to explore the possibility of hitching a ride on the PPP-PML-N agreement bandwagon to establish a coalition government at the Centre.
According to reports, the party's delegation, led by Central Secretary General Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, convened with Balochistan Awami Party's Mir Khalid Khan Magsi and Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani to delve into the prevailing political landscape, particularly in Balochistan.
Meanwhile, inside sources revealed that during the meeting between PML-N leader Ishaq Dar and JUI-F's Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, the latter extended an offer to form a coalition government in Balochistan. “The PML-N and the JUI-F can at least form a coalition government in Balochistan,” sources quoted Haideri as saying.
However, Dar conveyed that the PML-N had already solidified a power-sharing agreement with the PPP in the province. ""We wanted to go together, but Maulana, you are too late,"" Dar responded, expressing frustration over unsuccessful attempts to engage with the JUI-F.
He informed Haideri that an agreement with the PPP had been reached, leaving the final decision regarding the JUI-F's offer to the party leadership. The development follows Maulana Fazl's bombshell claims, asserting that the no-confidence motion against PTI founder Imran Khan in March 2022 was orchestrated by former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa.
The claims put the JUI-F's former allies, PPP and PML-N, on the defensive, as they had consistently denied the PTI founder's allegations of engineered ouster. Following his refusal to accept the results of the February 8 elections, Maulana Fazl claimed that his party had been deliberately defeated in multiple constituencies through rigging and irregularities.
In an unexpected turn of events, he even held discussions with his arch-rivals from the PTI, contemplating joint protests against the alleged rigging in the elections. The JUI-F chief faced criticism from the PPP and PML-N for his claims, with both parties rejecting his allegations of rigging and the subsequent no-confidence motion.
 
'Baseless rumours'
However, PML-N's Information Secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb refuted media reports about PML-N and JUI-F, dismissing them as baseless.
She emphasised the mutual respect and cooperation between the two parties and urged the media to refrain from speculating about their meetings.
A subsequent official statement from the PML-N clarified that, considering the challenges faced by Balochistan, a strong democratic government is imperative.
The meeting participants, recognising the need for various political forces to unite in Balochistan, affirmed their commitment to cooperation, as outlined in the official declaration.
PPP, PML-N forge coalition pact for Balochistan govt
In a related development, the PPP and the PML-N reached a consensus to establish a coalition government in Balochistan.
A key PPP leader in Balochistan confirmed to The Express Tribune that the PPP is set to claim the position of chief minister, while the governor's role will be handed over to the PML-N.
The distribution of portfolios between the two major political entities is pending, with the leader providing no further details.
""CM from PPP and Governor from PML N"", he mentioned.
The next 24 hours are anticipated to be crucial as the nomination for the chief minister’s position in Balochistan is expected to be announced. Chairman PPP Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari is slated to make the official announcement regarding the new CM from PPP.
Several notable figures are being considered for the chief ministerial role, including Mir Sadiq Umrani, a member of the PPP central executive committee, Nawab Sanaullah Zehri – who is also considered an ‘old jiyala’ – the former chief minister of Balochistan, and Sarfaraz Bugti, the former caretaker interior minister.
The potential candidates are vigorously vying for the coveted position.
Meanwhile, the former ruling party, the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), is also expected to be part of the forthcoming coalition government in Balochistan.
Jam Kamal Khan, the former CM of Balochistan and a PML-N leader, recently met with Chairman Senate Sadiq Sanjrani, aiming to garner support from the BAP. Jam Kamal is considered a strong contender from the PML-N for the position of CM in Balochistan.
The PML-N has emerged as the second-largest parliamentary party in the Balochistan Assembly, boasting 13 lawmakers, while the PPP claims the top spot with 14 members in the house.
Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail, the PML-N Balochistan president, expressed the party's strong desire to secure the CM position in Balochistan, citing robust representation in the assembly.
On the other hand, the Jamiat ul Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) with 11 lawmakers is yet to make a decision regarding government formation.
Sources within the JUI-F revealed that the party plans to sit on the opposition benches following the directives and decision of its chief, Maulana Fazalur Rehman.
The development came a day after a consensus was reached between the PML-N and the PPP to share power to form the next government, claiming a comfortable majority in the lower house of parliament to clinch the slot of the prime minister.

1,Govt won’t let social media become ‘propaganda’ tools,Minister says action to be taken against such platforms under law,"Caretaker Information Minister Murtaza Solangi on Thursday said that some elements were using social media platforms to incite violence, which was an illegal activity.

Addressing a news conference along with Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Interfaith Harmony Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi, he said the government would take strict action against such illegal activities under the law.

He said that freedom of expression under Article 19 of the Constitution was not unlimited, rather it was subject to law of the land. Under Article 19, derogatory remarks against judiciary, armed forces and brotherly countries were not allowed, Solangi remarked.

He said that the companies earning billions of dollars from the social media platforms cannot shirk responsibility for disruptions in law and order incited through their platforms.

The minister said that social media giants ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), YouTube, Facebook and Instagram had been continuously used for propaganda, lies, defamation of government officials and harassment, and the companies owning these platforms would have to control this illegal activity.

“The state of Pakistan will not in any way allow these platforms to spread baseless, false and fabricated propaganda in the country,” he added.

The minister said if this baseless propaganda was not stopped by these social media platforms, the state would have to take strict measures under the law.

He said there were means of legal review against any decision of the judiciary and if anyone had a complaint, a review petition could be filed.

The minister stated categorically that no one would be allowed to take the law into their hands and disturb the peace and tranquility of the country. “Pakistan is a peaceful country with rule of law and lawlessness and anarchy will not be allowed to be spread in the country,” he added.

He said all foreigners living in Pakistan should feel assured that they were safe and their security would be ensured by the Pakistan government.

Earlier, chairing the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar said the caretaker setup in a short span of time had left behind a useful strategy for the upcoming elected government that would ensure public welfare and protect national interests.

""The caretaker government always gave priority to national interests while taking policy decisions as it believed to work together for national stability and development,"" the prime minister said.

He said the government had improved the national economy, adding ""we are leaving country's economy in a better condition than before"". He appreciated and thanked his cabinet members and civil servants for their tireless efforts during short tenure of the government.

Among other agenda items, the cabinet, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, allowed Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir NI (M) to receive the ""Turkish Armed Forces Legion of Merit"" awarded by Turkiye in honor of his services regarding cooperation between the armed forces of Pakistan and Turkiye.

On the recommendation of ministry of finance, the cabinet also approved the extension of deputation period of Lubna Farooq Malik as Director General Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) from June 9, 2023 to June 8, 2024.

The cabinet, on the recommendation of ministry of National Food Security and Research (MNFS&R), approved the signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between MNFS&R Pakistan and Khalifa International Award for Date Palm and Agriculture Innovation.

The cabinet also approved the decisions made in the meeting of the Cabinet Committee for State Owned Enterprises held on February 16, 2024. The Federal Cabinet ratified the decisions taken in the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Cases held on February 16, 2024.

2,SC alarmed over smear drive against CJ,Blames media for insensitive reporting of judgment,"The Supreme Court on Thursday deplored “unfortunate” criticism aimed at it over a judgement ordering the release of a person accused of distributing supposedly proscribed religious literature.

In response to an escalating online campaign targeting Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, the Supreme Court issued a clarification about a recent verdict involving a man accused of committing blasphemy.

The campaign gained momentum following the CJP’s remarks in the blasphemy-related case that surfaced online.
In the judgment, CJP Isa underscored Holy Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) duty to convey the message of the Almighty without enforcing belief in it.

Citing verses from the Holy Quran, the chief justice emphasised Islam's fundamental tenets, notably the freedom of faith.
""Sadly, in matters of religion, tempers flare up, and the mandate of the Holy Quran is forsaken,"" the CJP noted, acknowledging the sensitivity surrounding religious issues.

The case involved the deletion of charges against a person accused of committing blasphemy, including Sections 7 and 9 of the Punjab Holy Quran (Printing and Recording) Act, 2011, as well as Sections 298-C and 295-B of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).

The top judge stressed the need for caution in religious matters. He regretfully noted that emotions often overrode facts in cases related to religious offences.

The court granted bail to the petitioner, Mubarak Ahmed Sani, upon providing a personal bond of Rs5,000.

A statement released by the top court addressed concerns over the misreporting by the media.

""Misreporting of a Supreme Court decision on electronic, print and social media is creating a lot of misunderstandings and giving the impression that the Supreme Court has deviated from the Second Constitutional Amendment (definition of ‘Muslim’) and has called for the abolition of provisions on 'crimes against religion'. This perception is completely wrong,” it read.

""In the case concerned, even if the allegations mentioned in the FIR are accepted as true, even then the provisions do not apply [to them]. In such cases, Section 5 of the Criminal Amendment Act, 1932 applies, under which publication of prohibited books can be punished with imprisonment for a maximum of six months,” it elaborated.

""Since the petitioner/accused has already spent more than one year in prison, the Supreme Court, keeping in view Islamic injunctions, constitutional provisions and the requirements of law and justice, ordered the release of the petitioner/accused on bail.”

The statement continued to outline CJP Isa's approach to judicial interpretation, stating that he tried to interpret all laws in accordance with Islamic rules, reasoning from the verses of the Holy Quran, Hadiths, decisions of the Caliphs, and the opinions of the jurists.

""If one believes that there has been a mistake in a judicial decision in the interpretation of an Islamic principle or a constitutional or legal provision, then it is the responsibility of the learned people to correct it. There are constitutional and legal avenues for [this purpose]. The chief justice and the Supreme Court have not stopped anyone before from a review, nor will they stop it now.""

The statement also condemned “organised campaign” against the judiciary, asserting that criticism should carried out while pursuing legal avenues. It warned against violating the right to freedom of expression, emphasising the judiciary's role in protecting the rights of the people in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

The controversy surrounding CJP Isa's observations escalated as several political parties in the country, including the PTI, JUI-F, and Jamaat-e-Islami joined the campaign.

These parties have actively called for CJP Isa to reconsider his verdict in the specific case, adding a political dimension to the already charged discourse on the matters of faith.

Meanwhile, the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) strongly condemned the “malicious and slanderous campaign” against the CJP.

“The campaign designed to bring the Supreme Court into disrepute and make the Chief Justice of Pakistan vulnerable is based on deliberating attempting to distort a decision of the Supreme Court,” the PBC said in a statement.

Moreover, the law enforcement agencies apprehended Abdul Wasay, a resident of Rawalpindi’s Pandora area, for launching a threatening campaign on the social media against CJP Isa.

Wasay, participating in a vile and threatening campaign against the chief justice on social media platform X, was involved in the top judge’s character assassination as well.

The arrest of Wasay signalled the government's commitment to curbing illegal activities on the social media.

The ongoing process of identifying and taking legal action against other individuals involved in the social media campaign against the CJP emphasised the authorities' dedication to maintaining law and order as well as safeguarding the principles of justice in the country.

3,Chatha admits staging poll rigging ‘drama’,Retracts earlier allegations; regrets ‘misleading’ nation at behest of a political party,"In a statement recorded before an Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) committee, former Rawalpindi commissioner Liaquat Ali Chatha on Thursday expressed his regret over his earlier ‘misleading’ allegation that the recent elections were rigged, adding that he had made the claim at the behest of a political party, without explicitly naming the PTI.

The former Rawalpindi commissioner, who had resigned from his post last week while making serious allegations of election rigging, also issued a public apology.

ECP sources said Chatha appeared before the ECP investigation committee and recorded his statement in response to a notice sent to him by the body a day earlier.

Sources revealed that all the district returning officers (DROs) and returning officers (ROs) of Rawalpindi Division had categorically rejected the accusations of rigging in the elections levelled by the former commissioner. The inquiry committee collected written statements from all six DROs of Rawalpindi Division.

During his fiery news conference last week, Chatha had raised serious concerns about election rigging. However, in his statement before the ECP committee, he attributed his actions to political pressure from the PTI leadership, without naming the party.

He admitted to orchestrating a news conference filled with drama and emotional rhetoric, including phrases related to suicide and hanging, under the guidance of the political party.

Chatha disclosed that at the time of the news conference, he was retiring on March 9 and concerned about his future as well as benefits, adding that after the 2018 elections, he had held many important positions in the Punjab government.

He revealed that during term as the Punjab secretary, he developed a close relationship with a senior official of a certain political party for future benefits.

This party official absconded because of his involvement in last year’s May 9 violence. However, Chatha said he kept in touch with the party official and secretly helped him.

The former commissioner said on February 11, he secretly went to Lahore and met the party official, who asked him to work on a plan to prove that this year’s general elections were rigged and in return promised him a higher position in the future.

At first, Chatha suggested that he should resign alleging that the elections were rigged.

However, in view of the apprehension that it would not have much effect, an emotional and drama-filled news conference was decided.

According to the political leader, the whole plan was organised under the full support and guidance of the top leadership of his party.

Chatha disclosed that the day of the news conference was scheduled on February 17 as per a deliberate plan, linking it with a protest staged by the political party.

He added that the name of Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa was deliberately included in the plan and the aim was to incite public hatred towards him.

The ex-Rawalpindi commissioner in his statement maintained that nobody, including the ECP, had instructed him to manipulate the election results.

More importantly, he continued that no RO was involved in any rigging process, refuting his earlier allegations.
“I am very ashamed of what I have done and seek forgiveness from the entire nation, especially all government employees because I have seriously damaged their reputation with false allegations,” he added.

In a related development, the interim Punjab government has decided to prosecute the former Rawalpindi commissioner over charges of conspiracy against the state, punishable by one to 10 years in prison.

According to the details, the additional IG legal has written a letter to the Punjab Home Department for taking strict action against Chatha under extraordinary provisions.

Sources said the additional IG legal has recommended taking action against Chatha under Section 153 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) for inciting hatred and dividing the society.

In addition, the official has also recommended framing charges against the former commissioner under Section 505 of the PPC for misusing his office, Section 178 of the Elections Act for interference in the voting process, and Section 186 of the PPC for taking action against government employees.

The sources said the interim provincial government had decided to prosecute Chatha under all these charges.

4,Altering poll results spells disaster: Gohar,Acting PTI chief stresses constitution’s supremacy,"Acting Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan asserted on Wednesday his party’s right to form governments at the Centre as well as in the provinces of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and demanded the announcement of the election results in accordance with the Form 45.
In a statement, Khan stressed that the future of Pakistan was linked to the supremacy of the Constitution and the utmost respect for democratic values. He warned that degrading the relationship between the state and the people, would not benefit the country in anyway.
“The Constitution entrusts the ownership of authority to the people, who exercise this authority through their elected representatives. By degrading this sacred relationship between the state and the people, it is futile to expect any good for us as a state,” he said.
“History is witness whenever there was an attempt to run the state without the Constitution and democracy, the country was engulfed in crises. The situation we are in as a state today requires us to be very serious and smart,” he added.
Khan said that PTI founder Imran Khan was unjustly imprisoned in false, fabricated and fake cases, the PTI’s electoral symbol of ‘bat’ was taken away, it was not allowed to run election campaign and every possible effort was made to throw it out of the election race by flouting the Constitution and the law.
In spite of all tactics, Khan continued, a clear and decisive public mandate was entrusted in the PTI. He warned that the move to forcibly change the election majority into a minority through manipulation of the results was a recipe for disaster.
Barrister Gohar demanded of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) that the election results should be released immediately in accordance with the of Form 45 and return the seats taken away from the PTI and the party should be given the right to form governments in K-P, Punjab and the Centre.

5,Imran wants IMF loan contingent upon vote audit,Says foreign lender should take note of massive rigging,"Founding chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Imran Khan on Thursday announced from jail that he would write a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), demanding it to halt the next loan to Pakistan unless there is a thorough probe into the alleged election rigging.

Notwithstanding its public posturing against the intervention of foreign institutions and powers into the country’s internal affairs, the former premier conveyed through his party’s lawyers that he would write the letter to the IMF on Feb 22 and urge it to link the talks and loan with audit of poll rigging.

Shockingly, Imran’s statement has come at a time when the country is embroiled in severe economic crisis and the upcoming government is already eying at a new IMF programme. The experts believe that writing such a letter was a terrible idea as it will not have any value but would lead to burning political capital and creating more rifts between PTI and powerful stakeholders.

“The whole world saw that the peoples vote was stolen in Pakistan,” Zafar said after meeting with Imran in jail, emphasizing that “democracy cannot run on the mandate of theft”. He elucidated, “when lending institutions see that there is no democracy, they do not give loans.”

In his media talk, Zafar, accompanied by incumbent PTI chairman Barrister Gohar, said that “our letter will be addressed to the IMF, and if the IMF desires discussion, an audit of election rigging must precede any dialogue.” He stressed, “where rigging is proven, rectification must occur before the IMF engagement.”

“Our agreement with the IMF is contingent upon an audit against rigging,” he reiterated. In response to a question if he asked Imran to reconsider writing the letter to IMF as such a move could enhance economic crises, Zafar said that he instead agrees with the move, saying linking loan with audit was “a necessary condition”.

“Imran Khan reportedly plans to write a letter to the IMF demanding it not fund Pakistan due to election rigging. Such a letter would be disregarded and have no value, but what a terrible idea. Pakistan badly needs a new loan. Not getting one could be catastrophic for the economy.” Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington DC-based Wilson Centre, stated on X, formerly Twitter.

Renowned political expert, Zaigham Khan said that Imran Khan has taken a dangerous decision by deciding to write the letter to IMF. It seems, the experts noted, PTI lawyers didn’t do their homework either before advising Imran.

Referring to IMF’s Articles of Agreement, which is commonly known as IMF charter, Zaigham said that there isn’t any clause pertaining to politics or good governance in the 123 pages of the charter, saying there no condition that a country could become IMF’s member if there was democracy in it.

“Having democracy in the country is not a condition in the IMF charter,” Zaigham said, saying that is why 190 members of IMF include countries where there is democracy or dictator is ruling as well as the countries whose elections are tainted.

“The IMF’s new program is a matter of life and death for Pakistan,” he said, saying it is the only thing that can stop Pakistan from default at the moment. Without IMF program, he said, neither friendly countries nor any global institutions would provide any financial support to Pakistan. He warned that such a situation could lead to similar situation that Sri Lanka faced a few months ago.

Zaigham recalled that PTI was repeating the same mistake that it made when it asked the then PTI finance ministers in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to not show budget surplus to IMF.

IN August 2022, some leaked audio clips of purported telephonic conversations between PTI’s ex-finance Shaukat Tarin and Punjab finance minister Mohsin Leghari and K-P’s Taimur Jhagra surfaced where Tarin could be heard telling them to tell the then PML-N-led federal government that provinces could not post a budget surplus — an IMF demand — in the light of devastating floods.

Back then, the PTI leadership was accused of attempting to sabotage the revival of IMF bailout package. Now, Zaigham noted, it appears that no lessons have been learned from previous mistakes.

6,Fazl won’t ‘lick boots’ to get to dummy parliament,JUI-F announces countrywide movement against alleged rigging in Feb 8 polls,"Castigating the military establishment for what he termed the ""most rigged elections"" in Pakistan’s history, Maulana Fazlur Rehman has declared that his party will not ""lick boots"" just to secure membership in a nominal parliament. Fazl’s party, the JUI-F, has, in the meanwhile, also announced a nationwide movement against alleged rigging in February 8 general elections.

Addressing his party members and supporters after a meeting in Islamabad on Thursday, Fazl said he expected that the February 8 elections would be free and fair.

However, he lamented, those hopes and the country’s Constitution got trampled on—on the election day. The JUI-F chief wondered what was the credibility of parliament in the wake of two consecutive controversial elections.

""If the establishment directly intervenes and chooses representatives from each constituency according to its own will, then they won't be representatives of the people. What kind of parliament would that be?” he said, adding that the candidacy of every lawmaker in such a parliament will become dubious.

He predicted that in the coalition government that is likely to be formed in the center, the two major parties—the PML-N and the PPP—will keep blackmailing each other while “someone else” will be pulling the strings behind the scenes.
The JUI-F chief said they are the flag-bearers of democracy and their elders are the founders of this Constitution. He said they want to safeguard the Constitution. However, he lamented that the Constitution has no significance now; it is just a piece of paper which holds no value.

He said even the parliament is not supreme as sovereignty rests with God. “But in Pakistan, we don’t even witness supremacy of parliament “as here our servants are our sovereigns.”

He claimed that in the February 8 elections, the establishment broke all records of rigging in the 75-year history of the country. Addressing the military leaders, he said: ""Uniforms do not confer respect on a person; rather, it is the character within a uniform which inspires respect.""

Fazl questioned the utility of joining a parliament which could not pass a legislation on its own and which only stamps its seal of approval on pieces of legislation imposed on it by the establishment.

He also questioned why his party should now continue electoral politics. “In the parliament, my power will depend on someone else but on the street, I will not need anyone else,” he said.

The JUI-F chief said militancy in the country is one the rise but the establishment is engaged in “other games”. He said the establishment considered itself beyond criticism and gets offended when people point the finger at it.

“They say we are defense forces and it is not justified to criticize us. I clarify that I do not criticize the country’s defense forces as long as they remain defense forces. But when they become political forces they become liable to be criticized.”
Fazl also criticized the mainstream political parties for their dual standards with regard to rigging.

He said the PML-N won almost a similar number of seats in both 2018 elections and 2024 elections. “in 2018, it had claimed that the elections were rigged but now [when it is able to lead a government] it says the elections are fair.”
He said the same was the case with the PTI as it also got almost the same number of seats in the 2018 and 2014 elections. “However, now that the PTI is not able to form a government, it says the polls were unfair.”

Fazl said only the JUI-F is the party which protested against rigging in 2018 polls and which also called these elections massively rigged.

Separately, the JU-F announced launching a movement against alleged rigging during the February 8 general elections.  JUI-F leader Aslam Ghauri, in a statement, said in the initial phase of the movement, meetings will be held at party level.
According to Ghauri, Maulana Fazlur Rehman will address these meetings and the first of such assemblies is set to take place on Thursday (today) in Islamabad. ""Rigging in these elections has put 2018's rigging to shame,"" he said. ""A mockery has been made of the public mandate"".

Previously on February 16, the JUI-F Sindh staged a protest demonstration outside the provincial office of the Election Commission of Pakistan in Karachi against alleged electoral fraud.

JUI-F Sindh Secretary General Rashid Mahmood Soomro addressed the gathering, stating that the JUI-F had decided to launch a nationwide movement against “doctored election results.”
