0,LHC orders consolidation of ‘symbol’ pleas,"Issues notices to govt, ECP over petition challenging polls body’s powers","The Lahore High Court (LHC) has ordered its registrar's office to club all petitions challenging the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) powers to strip a political party of its election symbol.

A division bench, led by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, passed this order during the hearing of an intra-court appeal on Wednesday. The bench also issued notices to the federal government and the ECP and sought their replies.

Advocate Azhar Siddique, who represented the petitioner, argued that the ECP does not have the authority to withdraw an electoral symbol from a political party. He claimed that Section 215 of the Election Act, 2017 is in violation of the Constitution.

When Justice Naqvi asked the petitioner whether political parties should be allowed not to hold intra-party elections, Siddique said such elections were vital but the ECP cannot deprive a party of its election symbol just because it has not conducted intra-party polls.

He said in such cases, the ECP could only levy fines on a political party.

Justice Naqvi said the Election Act, 2017 was passed unanimously by all parliamentary parties. He also noted that no political party has challenged the ECP’s powers to deprive a party of its symbol.

Subsequently, the bench issued notices to the respondents, ordered the LHC registrar to club all similar petitions, and adjourned the matter.

The ECP on December 22 deprived the former ruling party, the PTI, of its iconic election symbol—the cricket bat—while hearing complaints that accused the party of holding intra-party elections in violation of its constitution.

The party later challenged the ECP order in the Peshawar High Court (PHC) which on January 10 invalidated the ECP order. The ECP challenged the PHC order in the Supreme Court which on January 13 dealt a heavy blow to the party by upholding the ECP order.

1,US wants poll fraud claims probed,Miller maintains that US wants to see full internet freedom around world,"The US State Department has emphasised that claims of “interference or fraud” in the Feb 8 polls should be “fully and transparently” investigated as per Pakistan’s laws and procedures.

Spokesperson Matthew Miller made these remarks while responding to a question about rigging allegations by former Rawalpindi commissioner Liaqat Ali Chatha.

“I don’t want to get into an internal Pakistani matter, which I very much believe that the formation of a new government is. But – so that’s a matter that I will leave to Pakistan. But as I said, when it comes to – any claims of interference or allegations of irregularities, we want to see those fully investigated,” he said in response to a question on PTI’s mandate.

On the recent suspension of X in the country, Miller maintained that the US wanted to see full internet freedom around the world “and that includes the availability of platforms that people use to communicate [with] each other”.

“We want internet platforms to be available to people in Pakistan and around the world,” he added.

2,SIC races to get its share of reserved seats,Party chairman informs ECP 86 independents elect have joined council,"The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) on Wednesday approached the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), seeking the allocation of reserved seats in the National Assembly and provincial assemblies after the PTI sealed its alliance with the council.

The ECP was requested to allot the seats on the basis of the inclusion of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed candidates in their party.

A request, in this regard, drafted by SIC Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza was submitted with the polls supervisory body through a PTI representative.

On Monday, the PTI announced that its independent candidates would join the SIC to form governments at the Centre, in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in a bid to secure reserved seats. The development came almost 10 days after the Feb 8 polls.

The party’s candidates were forced to contest the elections as independents after the apex court upheld the election supervisor’s decision, considering its intra-party polls “unconstitutional” and revoked its claim on the electoral symbol of ‘bat’.

The PTI-backed independent lawmakers, who just joined the SIC, clinched 93 seats in the lower house of parliament as well 84 and 116 in K-P and Punjab assemblies, respectively.

As per the Constitution, the reserved seats are allocated to the political parties on the basis of the number of their lawmakers elected on the general seats. For their allocation, the ECP had already received the priority list of candidates from the parties before the Feb 8 polls.

The situation this year is different from the previous elections as the largest group of lawmakers are independents, who cannot have the reserved seats.

There are a total of 346 reserved seats for women – 60 in the NA and 66, 29, 26, and 11 in the provincial legislatures of Punjab, Sindh, K-P, and Balochistan.

Similarly, there are 10 reserved seats for minorities in the lower house. Besides, there are eight, nine and three reserved seats for minorities in the Punjab Sindh, and Balochistan assemblies.

Based on the current election results, the PML-N is likely to bag 17 reserved seats for women in the NA, 33 in Punjab and one in Balochistan.

Besides, it will also be allocated two reserved seats for minorities in the lower house and four in Punjab.
The PPP will fetch 10 reserved seats in the NA from Sindh as well as a reserved seat each for women and minorities from Punjab in the lower house.

The party will receive 19 reserved seats for women and six for minorities in the Sindh Assembly. In addition, it will bag two reserved seats for minorities in the Punjab Assembly as well.

The MQM-P will bag four women's seats in the NA. It will also fetch six seats for women and two for minorities in the Sindh Assembly.

Based on these figures, if the PTI-backed members after their inclusion in the SIC, the party will be allocated 22 reserved seats for women in the NA, 20 in K-P, and 27 in Punjab, beside three seats for minorities.

Raza’s letter stated that 86 independent candidates of the National Assembly had joined the SIC, adding that 107 independents of Punjab Assembly, 90 of K-P Assembly and nine independent members of Sindh Assembly now garnered the support of the SIC.

The SIC requested the polls supervisory body to allocate reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies seats on these criteria.

The R and I branch of ECP received the letter and assigned the diary number.

3,Kaira top contender for Punjab governor,"Makhdoom Ahmed, Nadeem Chan also vying for the post","The Pakistan People's Party (PPP) kicked off deliberations on Wednesday to select candidates for the crucial governorships of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).

Insider sources disclosed that prominent political figures in contention for the coveted role in Punjab include Makhdoom Ahmed Mehmood, Qamar Zaman Kaira, and Nadeem Afzal Chan.

This comes as power-sharing agreements between the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the PPP are gradually taking shape under a carefully crafted formula.

The two parties on Tuesday agreed to jointly wield power in the upcoming government, securing a comfortable majority in the lower house of parliament.

Following the crystallisation of the power-sharing formula, PPP leadership is actively engaged in consultations to finalise the nominee for the position of Punjab governor.

Sources suggest that the party leadership will soon make a definitive decision on the Punjab governor after concluding the ongoing consultations.

Simultaneously, within the party ranks, deliberations are underway to select the PPP governor for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Multiple names are under consideration, including current and former party presidents. In addition to the current provincial president, Syed Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha, other notable figures like Syed Zahir Ali Shah, Engineer Humayun Khan, and the provincial information secretary, Amjad Afridi, are part of the deliberations.

The ultimate approval of the selected names for the governorships, or any alternative candidates, rests with the central leadership of the PPP. This decision is expected to be finalized after the establishment of the new government.

It is worth noting that the incumbent governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Haji Ghulam Ali, assumed office in November 2022. Before him, Shah Farman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) held the position, resigning after the conclusion of the Imran Khan-led government at the centre.

During the interim period, the duties of the governor were temporarily assumed by the speaker of the provincial assembly, Mushtaq Ghani, for a duration of seven months.

4,JCP to discuss BHC judge’s elevation to SC,CJ Qazi Faez Isa has nominated Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan for promotion to the apex court,"Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa has nominated Balochistan High Court (BHC) Chief Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan as a judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) will consider this nomination at its upcoming meeting on February 23.

If appointed, Justice Afghan will be the third judge from Balochistan to serve in the Supreme Court, following CJ Isa himself and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail.

Though the total number of positions in the SC is 17, it currently has only 14 judges. SC’s Senior Puisne Judge Sardar Tariq Masood is also scheduled to retire next month, on March 10.

On Friday, February 23, the JCP will also discuss the elevation of Lahore High Court (LHC) senior judge Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan to the position of the provincial high court’s chief justice.

5,"Qaiser takes a dig at PML-N, PPP",Asks both parties to ‘show some respect and step aside from govt’,"PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser on Wednesday launched a diatribe against the PML-N and the PPP, saying the parties should “show some grace and step aside from the government’.

A day earlier, both the parties finally cooked up a deal to once again sew together a coalition government in the Centre. They reached a consensus on splitting up the power pie, deciding on crucial positions including prime minister, president, governorships, and chairman Senate.

Under the power-sharing recipe, Shehbaz Sharif is set to assume the role of prime minister once again, while Asif Ali Zardari will reoccupy the presidential chair.

In addition, the PPP is slated to assume the roles of Senate chairman and Punjab governor, while the governors in both Sindh and Balochistan will belong to PML-N.

The agreement put the brakes on the days of political limbo, potentially resolving the deadlock in the wake of the Feb 8 elections that left the national assembly hanging in the balance.

While negotiations unfolded for government formation, the PTI had formed an alliance with the Sunni Ittehad Council to secure the necessary numbers through reserved seats in the assemblies.

In a media talk outside Adiala Jail, PTI's Qaiser said Shehbaz had a 'minority stake' in the elections and the people never gave him the mandate for premiership.

“PML-N and PPP should show some grace and step aside from the government,” he said while censuring PML-N’s Ishaq Dar and his handling of the economy during his previous stints as finance minister.

“The PPP is telling the people that they are not a part of the government […] but you are taking the post of Senate chairman on their [PML-N’s] vote,” he lamented.

8,Ex-LHC judge says resignation 'rebellion against system',Justice (retd) Shahid refutes claims of resigning 'under duress'; advises other judges to 'not give in to fear',"Former Lahore High Court Judge Shahid Jameel Khan, speaking publicly for the first time since his resignation earlier this month, characterized his decision as a “rebellion against a system held hostage by vested interests.”
Addressing a lawyers’ convention, he lamented the capture of the system by certain individuals who seek to wield it according to their whims.
Highlighting the prevalent instability in Pakistan, Justice Shahid expressed concern that some judges continue to operate under fear, fearing job loss or displeasure from superiors. Urging a break from this fear-driven culture, he emphasized the importance of unity and courage for the nation to stand as one.
Justice (retd) Khan refuted speculations of resigning under duress, affirming that his resignation was a personal choice made after careful deliberation on what was best for him. He underscored the importance of upholding one’s self-respect and making decisions independently, without succumbing to pressure or compromise.
“My resignation serves as a testament to those who yield to pressure,” he asserted, advocating for judges to base their decisions on principles, free from external influence or intimidation.
Read Naqvi's resignation misses its mark
Responding to a query regarding “the establishment” approaching him, the retired judge said that he had “only twice been approached by them”. Once after his confirmation as a judge when “a lawyer approached me to convey a ‘zoo official’s’ message regarding wanting to meet me"". ""I was told the official was really 'impressed' by me,"" the judge said, adding that he refused the meeting offer.
The second time, he said, was when “a car chased me during the time I was hearing some matters related to cantonment elections in Rawalpindi,” he said.
Justice Shahid claimed that he was informed that the car chase was a warning for him. “Although they did not accept responsibility, everyone knows who they were,” the judge said.
Justice Shahid's resignation
On February 2, Justice Shahid tendered his resignation from his office, citing “personal circumstances” in which he had decided to “turn the page and start a new chapter”.
In his resignation letter, sent to President Dr Arif Alvi, he stated, “It was an absolute honour to hold the office, but for personal circumstances I have decided to turn the page and start a new chapter.""
His resignation marked the third such departure within a month during Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa's tenure.
Justice Shahid, who remained part of the LHC bench since 2014, decided to step down, adding to the recent exits of Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, both SC judges.
