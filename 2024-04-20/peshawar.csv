3,"Centre asks KP govt to help recover Rs188bn from Pesco, Tesco",ISLAMABAD: Seeking support of the provincial government to minimise over Rs188bn worth of energy loss in Khyber...,"ISLAMABAD: Seeking support of the provincial government to minimise over Rs188bn worth of energy loss in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through theft and low recoveries, the federal government has asked KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gundapur to find out a workable solution to challenges in Peshawar and Tribal electric supply companies.
The prime minister has already constituted a special team led by Defence Minister Khwaja M Asif for consultations with the KP government and other stakeholders to finalise a sustainable plan of action and asked Mr Gandapur to join these interactions and support the initiative.
In a letter to CM Gandapur, power minister Awais Leghari said both Pesco and Tesco were “among the low performing Discos which are contributing to ever increasing circular debt. During the current financial year, combined loss of Rs188 billion, which includes under recovery and loss above regulatory threshold, is anticipated in Pesco and Tesco”.
Critical high loss areas identified in Pesco also included Dera Ismail Khan -- the hometown of Mr Gandapur -- besides adjacent Bannu, Karak, Kohat, Shangla and formerly frontier regions. Tesco operates in former tribal areas where there is serious problem of non-recovery and non-meterisation. Due to these factors, Tesco may make loss of Rs51bn in the current financial year.
He said the success of nationwide anti-theft campaign to reduce losses and improve recovery was dependent “on wholehearted support of provincial government and its authorities which is not currently available in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa”.  
The power minister sought the chief minister’s specific interest to ensure that support of police was available in Pesco so that anti-theft campaign was successfully implemented in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and menace of theft was rooted out.
Besides, “there is a challenge of weak writ of the government in the operational jurisdiction of Tesco”, he said and proposed that the KP government should prepare comprehensive plan to support Tesco in recovery and meterisation drive or it should take over supply of power in Tesco region.

4,Institutions should stick to constitutional role: Aimal,"ANP leader says he’ll raise voice for rights of KP, Balochistan in Senate","CHARSADDA: Awami National Party president for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Senator Aimal Wali Khan on Friday said all national institutions should restrict themselves to their constitutional roles.
Addressing a news conference in Wali Bagh here, the ANP leader said the security establishment should do away with its involvement in politics and should focus on their task of protecting borders.
He said the Saudi investment in Pakistan was welcome, but as the regional situation was alarming, he wondered if the Saudi investment was a “deal against Iran.”
Mr Aimal said the Chinese nationals could freely move in Punjab cities and Karachi, but it was surprising to see them come under attack after entry to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He said the Chinese nationals were attacked in Malakand division, but authorities suspended the deputy inspector general of Hazara region, who was reportedly the brother-in-law of the province’s police chief.

ANP leader says he’ll raise voice for rights of KP, Balochistan in Senate

The ANP leader said the province had been destroyed “financially and administratively” during the last 10 years, and once again, the province was being handed over to the facilitators of militants.
He alleged that on one hand, 40,000 militants were “being resettled” in KP, but on the other, official security cover was withdrawn from the ANP’s leadership.
Mr Aimal said he had asked the party’s leaders to make security arrangements for them.
He, however, warned that if the lives of ANP leaders or workers were harmed, the party would lodge criminal cases against the chief minister, police chief, corps commander, and sector commander of Peshawar.
The ANP leader said the ANP could speak to political forces only and wouldn’t become part of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan.
He claimed that his party was offered governorship and ministries in the province after the February 2024 general elections, but it refused to accept them.
Mr Aimal said if his election as senator was “someone else’s job,” as a few people claimed, then they should know that the ANP was offered “many things,” but it rejected all those offers.
He said the province was denied its rights under the 18th Constitutional Amendment.
“I’ll raise a voice for the rights of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan in the Senate,” he said.
Mr Aimal thanked the Pakistan Peoples Party for supporting him in the recent Senate elections.
He complained that despite the court’s orders, oaths weren’t administered to women and minority members of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
The ANP leader said the KP government didn’t represent residents. He urged workers to participate in the April by-election in the Bajaur tribal district.
Mr Aimal said the party would continue fighting for people’s rights and would hold a public meeting in Buner on April 26.
ANP leaders Haji Ghulam Ahmad Bilour, Senator Hidayatullah, Hussain Shah Khan, Sardar Hussain Babak, and Mukhtyar Khan were also present on the occasion.

“We can make these efforts successful only through an effective and better teamwork,” he said while addressing an important meeting of the Provincial Task Force (PTF) for Polio Eradication Initiative held at the Chief Minister’s House here.

6,Opposition MPAs take govt to court over authorisation of expenditure,They insist cabinet okayed expenses for one month without following procedure,"PESHAWAR: The opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz on Friday moved the Peshawar High Court against the authorisation of expenditure by the provincial government for a month.
It requested the court to declare the government’s move illegal and unconstitutional.
In a joint petition, two PML-N MPAs, including Leader of the Opposition in the provincial assembly Ibadullah Khan and Sobia Shahid, said the April 5 decision of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet regarding the authorisation of essential expenditure of the provincial government for the month of April of the financial year 2023-24.
They also prayed the court to direct the provincial government to immediately call the provincial assembly session and pass the essential expenditures for an appropriate period until the presentation of the regular budget in the house.

They insist cabinet okayed expenses for one month without following procedure

The petition filed through lawyer Aminur Rehman Yousafzai included as respondents the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government through its chief secretary, provincial finance secretary, speaker, and secretary of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
The petitioners said that the provincial assembly was dissolved on Jan 19, 2023, by the KP governor on the advice of the then chief minister and a caretaker government was later installed in the province.
They said that piecemeal authorisation of expenditure for four months was approved under Article 126 of the Constitution by the caretaker cabinet for July-Oct 2023 and Nov 2023-Feb 2024, respectively, in July and Nov 2023.
The opposition lawmakers said that the general elections were held on Feb 8, 2024, and the first meeting of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial assembly was held on Feb 28 for the oath- taking of the newly elected members.
They added that the previous period of the authorisation of expenditure expired on Feb 29 and therefore, the provincial assembly approved the authorisation of expenditure for a further period of one month (March 2024) under Article 125 of the Constitution on March 4.
The petitioners said that the period of authorisation also expired on March 31.
They said that after the lapse of a one-month period of authorised expenditure, the provincial government, in order to approve authorisation of expenditure for a further period, opted for the analogy of Article 126, through which a caretaker provincial government was authorised to sanction expenditure.
The petitioners contended that without following the prescribed constitutional procedure, the cabinet authorised the essential expenditure for the month of April in its meeting held on April 5.
They contended that the provincial cabinet had deliberately misinterpreted Article 126 of the Constitution for ulterior motives in order to frustrate judgement of the high court on March 27, wherein it directed the speaker of the assembly to administer oaths to the opposition members elected to seats reserved for women and non-Muslims in the assembly.
The petitioners said that the provincial government had no lawful authority to deprive the provincial assembly of its mandate in the budget matters conferred under Article 125 of the Constitution.
They said that the provincial assembly had been there since Feb 28, 2024, whereas Article 126 of the Constitution, which was exclusively related to a caretaker government when the assembly had been dissolved, had been invoked by the government, which was illegal and unconstitutional.

As authorities didn’t deliver the books, teachers of government schools in Bisham asked students promoted to next grades to return old course books for use by other schoolchildren, according to students and their parents.
Student Mishal Khan, who was promoted to grade 4, told Dawn that she had returned her books to the school but hadn’t got books for the new class.
She also complained that textbooks were not available on the market, so there were chances of learning loss.
Habib Yousafzai, a ninth grader at the Government Higher Secondary School, Butyal, said he and his classmates were upset as they returned home without books.
“Education is our fundamental right, so the state is responsible for providing us with free textbooks, but unfortunately, it has failed to do so,” he said.
Mohammad Qasim, a student of a school in Bisham, wondered how he would study in the absence of course books.
He said the government should immediately make arrangements for books to provide them with books so that they could continue their studies without spoiling their time.
The student said the education department had issued a letter to the district education departments on March 26 urging them to collect old books from the students and re-distributed among the promoted pupils.
Shahid Ahmad, the principal of Government Higher Secondary School Butyal, told Dawn that the department recently instructed the school to collect old books from students as it would provide 90 per cent of books from nursery class to grade 3 and the rest to other grades, but those books had yet to reach it.
“The books collected from students are not usable but we distributed them to some students. As there is a lack of textbooks, the attendance of students was very low on Thursday,” he said.
A senior teacher said 90 per cent of collected books were in bad condition but the school had no option but to distribute a single book from each set to students.
When contacted, district education officer Muzzaffar Sayed said textbooks had yet to be supplied from Peshawar.

9,"Govt claims int’l partners have promised $1.8bn investment in ex-Fata, Dir, Chitral",CM’s aide urges centre to clear province’s dues before budget’s announcement,"PESHAWAR: Adviser to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on finance Muzammil Aslam on Friday said the international partners at a donors’ conference arranged by the provincial government promised to invest $1.8 billion in the province for the development of the long-neglected merged tribal districts as well as Dir and Chitral regions.
Mr Aslam told a news conference in Islamabad that the KP government signed $1.8 billion agreements with its international partners, with the ADB committing $1 billion, the World Bank $500 million, and others the rest of the amount.
“During the conference, the international donors pledged complete support and inked agreements worth $1.8 billion with various development partners,” he said, according to an official statement issued here.
Mr Aslam noted that the funds would be utilised for the uplift and development of the merged tribal districts (formerly Fata), Dir and Chitral, which were blessed with national resources but had been neglected for a long time.

CM’s aide urges centre to clear province’s dues before budget’s announcement

He said that the pledged funds would not only help develop those regions but also ensure peace in those areas.
The adviser said that the donor conference was attended by representatives of the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, Japan International Cooperation Agency, USAID, the United Nations Development Programme and other international organisations.
He said that the donors’ conference mainly focused on three areas: knowledge-based tools, long-term and effective projects for merged districts, and development packages for Dir and Chitral regions.
The adviser said the KP government delivered within 45 days and took some tangible and practical steps for economic recovery and resolving public issues.
He also urged the federal government to release the province’s long overdue payments before the budget’s announcement.
Mr Aslam said the KP government had written 12 letters to the centre regarding the non-release of the provincial funds under various heads.
He said that the provincial government had written letters regarding the National Finance Commission and FBR and clearance of the dues of billions of rupees of hydel profit.
The adviser to the chief minister said that KP produced 6,600 megawatts of electricity for just Rs1.1 per unit, while the price of electricity was Rs30 per unit in the country.
He said that the province had the potential to produce 30,000 megawatts of electricity, insisting that the center should encourage the province instead of discouraging it by erecting various obstacles.
Talking about the International Monetary Fund’s loan programme, he revealed that the IMF demanded of Pakistan to “do more” and double the speed of reforms amid the ongoing talk of a fresh financial bailout package.
He, however, said that the IMF board of directors had yet to meet to decide about the release of the third tranche of the earlier promised financial package.
He demanded that Afghan businessmen be facilitated and encouraged instead of creating handicaps for them because they had been living in the province for a long time.
On the occasion, spokesman for the PTI Raoof Hasan flayed the accusation of CM’s adviser, Mishal Yousafzai, against a Peshawar reporter and said that he, along with the CM and Barrister Saif, were looking into the matter.
“I will hold a separate news conference on this matter,” he said.

They said the differences emerged after Mubarak Zeb, the younger brother of slain PTI leader Rehan Zeb Khan, who was killed in an armed attack on January 31 during his election campaign for NA-8 and PK22 in the February 8 general elections, decided to take part in the by-election as independent on both the seats after the PTI parliamentary board ignored him in the allocation of ticket.
The decision has split the PTI into two groups. The party had won all the three seats of the provincial assembly in the district in the general elections.
Sources told Dawn that Mubarak Zeb’s position was strong as majority of workers were supporting him, threatening the prospects of Gul Zafar Khan and Gul Dad Khan, who are aspiring for NA-8 and PK-22, respectively.
The sources said both the PTI candidates had tried to get Mr Zeb withdraw from the election race, but he refused to do so.
They said most of PTI leaders, including Nawagai tehsil council chairman Dr Khalilur Rahman, were now supporting Mubarak Zeb in the by-election.
According to observers, the recent impressive public gatherings of Mubarak Zeb showed he would give tough time to PTI contestants on both the seats.
Meanwhile, the Dera’s NA-44 constituency, where the by-election is going to be held on Sunday, consists of 57 village and 129 neighbourhood councils. It has a total of 396,661 registered voters, including 185,629 women.
As many as 358 polling stations, including 126 for men, 115 for women and 117 combined, have been established with a total of 1,172 polling booths, including 635 for men and 537 women.
The front-runners include Sardar Faisal Amin Khan Gandapur, the brother of Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and the joint candidate of Sunni Ittehad Council and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf; and Pakistan Peoples Party’s Abdul Rasheed Kundi, who is also uncle of PPP central information secretary Faisal Karim Khan Kundi and MPA Ahmed Karim Khan Kundi.
Other candidates include Mohammad Ejaz Awan of Jamaat-i-Islami, Zameer Hussain alias Roshan Zameer Laghari of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, Pakistan Messiah Party’s Amber Nawaz Malik Advocate, independent Sheikh Mohammad Yaqub, who is former MNA, and Pakistan Nazriyati Council’s Mohammad Fawad.

He said Naranji was mountainous terrain, where growers cultivated poppy in inaccessible areas to hide it from police.
However, he said revenue department officials provided the police with a map showing the areas were the banned crop was grown. 
Another official, who supervised the operation, said the action continued despite rain.
The official said the farmers pledged they wouldn’t cultivate the banned crop in future. He said local jirga members were also involved in making the farmers not to grow poppy in future.
A farmer in Naranji area told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the growers were happy to cultivate poppy as it gave them more profits than other crops.

“A higher CNG rate means a higher income tax, so we have adjusted it in the CNG’s fresh value under a formula agreed upon by the FBR and our [CNG station owners] association in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the manager of a CNG station told Dawn.
Transporters declared the latest surge in sales taxunjustifiedand demanded the government immediately withdraw it to prevent transport fares from going up.
