0,NA speaker suspends two SIC MPs’ membership,Sadiq said Dasti and Khan violated Rule 30 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business,"The treasury benches stirred up the ghosts of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) past -– now reincarnated in parliament as the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) -– as it reminded the National Assembly of the former ruling party's controversial decision to allow the resettlement of terrorists during its tenure, plunging citizens back into the dark abyss of terrorism.
The government, however, stood firm, declaring that negotiations with terrorist organisations were off the table and they would be given a dose of their own medicine. “With absolute clarity, the government has decided that there will be no talks with terrorists,” Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar said on the floor of the house. “The terrorist will be paid back in their own coins.”
The law minister took the opportunity to castigate the previous PTI administration, recalling how they had arranged a security briefing within the hallowed halls of parliament and subsequently greenlit the resettlement of thousands of terrorists within the nation's borders, who had been pushed out by the police, army, and people of Pakistan.
“The citizens of Pakistan were once again exposed to terrorists,” the law minister regretted.
Before and after the elections, parties included in the PML-N-led coalition have strongly criticised the terrorist resettlement policy of the PTI government and called for a comprehensive inquiry into the release of outlawed individuals associated with Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
They have also questioned the decision to invite them to settle in the tribal areas of the country by former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently in jail and facing multiple cases. Recently, Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, including on Chinese nations, and the government and the security forces have since been devising strategies to protect people and defeat terrorism.
The senator said that the government has a zero-tolerance policy, saying the security institutions along with federal and provincial governments were fighting against terrorists. He said that the officials of the security forces were laying down their lives to protect citizens and the homeland.
In response to a question, Tarar said the Balochistan government is taking steps to punish terrorists involved in the Noshki incident and the federal government is extending all help to the provincial government through various institutions whenever and wherever it is required.
Efforts are underway to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorist organizations, he said, adding that federal government agencies are on their toes to support the provincial governments, including in their operations against dacoits of Kacha areas. The law minister said that Pakistan has been facing terrorism for the past four decades and the issue will take time to resolve.
In response to different questions, the law minister reiterated that the federal government through ministry of interior will continue to provide support to the provincial governments within the bounds of law and rules to combat terrorism.
Responding to another question, Tarar said that the government takes up issues at appropriate forums when there is solid evidence and credible information of the involvement of any foreign element in terrorist incidents.
He also said that it was up to Afghanistan how it wanted to have a relationship with any other country when his attention was drawn toward Afghan-India ties.
Meanwhile, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar drew the house’s attention towards a statement by a PTI official against Saudi Arabia when he alleged that KSA was also involved in the alleged regime change operation when the PTI government was ousted.
The information minister said that there have been multiple statements from the PTI officials regarding friends of Pakistan, saying one official says something and the party issues a rebuttal to it, recalling PTI has earlier accused the US of ousting it from power in April 2022 before taking a U-turn on it. Ata Tara accused ex-PM Imran Khan of habitually playing with foreign policy, alleging he compromised on the confidential system of the diplomatic corps when discussing cypher in public.
Memberships suspended
Friday's session also saw the suspension of two members of SIC, Jamshed Ahmed Dasti and Mohammad Iqbal Khan.
NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said that they have used abusive language, approached the dice of the speaker in a threatening manner, blew whistles and trumpets which has never happened in the parliament before, chanted objectionable slogans, displayed banners and placards, indulged in rowdy behaviour and eroded the sanctity of the house.
The speaker said that Dasti and Khan violated Rule 30 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007.
Subsequently, Sadiq while accusing two members of disregarding the authority of the Speaker and obstructing proceedings put a question to the house if Dasti and Khan be suspended for the remainder of the session or now.
The house voted in favour of the suspension of the two SIC members. The Speaker then adjourned the session to meet again on April 27 at 5pm.
The motion said: “Jamshed Dasti and Muhammad Iqbal MNAs used abusive language and approached the dais of the speaker in a threatening manner, which is unacceptable.”
The motion further detailed their disruptive behaviour, including “blowing whistles and trumpets, chanting objectionable slogans, and displaying banners and placards”, saying that such actions violated the sanctity of the house and the rules outlined in the Rules of Procedure of Conduct of Business International 2007.
Citing Rule 21 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the NA read with Rule 33 of the Parliament Joint Sitting Rules 1973, the NA speaker named them and ordered the withdrawal of their membership from the assembly’s current session.
This decision was made by the established rules and regulations to maintain the decorum and integrity of parliamentary proceedings.
The motion was passed after a majority of voice votes.

1,"Protest drive will spell doom for ‘fake govt’, says Fazl",JUI-F chief asserts movement originating in Balochistan will resonate nationwide,"JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has claimed that a political movement starting from Balochistan will ultimately lead to the ouster of the PML-N-led “fake government” that has come into power through “massively rigged elections.”
Fazl’s JUI-F was part of an alliance of political parties—the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)—that governed the country after the removal of the PTI government from April 2022 till August 2023.
However, the party became estranged from its former allies—the PML-N and the PPP—after the general elections on February 8, in which it performed poorly and could only secure six National Assembly seats. Fazl later accused the powers that be of massive rigging.
Addressing a rally in Balochistan’s Pishin district on Saturday, Fazl criticized both the political government and the establishment.
He said rigging took place in the 2018 elections, against which the public mobilized and achieved success. The rigging in the 2024 elections, he said, is even more shameful, as it resulted in bringing fake representatives into power.
“The JUI-F called out the wrong yesterday and still calls it out today. Our workers will never tire of calling out the wrong,” he said.
“This movement against this fake government has originated from Balochistan. It will spread across the country. We will not allow this fake government to remain in power,” he added.
Interestingly, a six-party opposition alliance also launched its protest movement from Balochistan’s Chaman and Pishin districts on April 13. The alliance—Tehreek Tahaffuz-e-Aain—comprises PTI, PkMAP, the SIC, the BNP-M, the JI, and the MWM.
Fazl said: ""The election results of February 8, 2024, are rejected. Money was taken from politicians to defeat the JUI-F. No one can stop the movement. It will continue to advance.”
He asked the rulers how much money they paid to “buy” the Balochistan Assembly.
“It should be revealed whether the assembly was bought for Rs70 billion or Rs80 billion. It should also be disclosed how much the assemblies of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) were bought for.
""I am predicting today that there will also be rigging in the upcoming by-election of Qila Abdullah. We are boycotting the by-election,"" he added.
Maulana Fazlur Rehman said the military had no role in the independence of this country and that the nation won freedom thanks to the sacrifices of common people and religious seminaries.
Warning the establishment, he said: “If you trample the Constitution and democracy, we will stand in front of you like a mountain. My ancestors have taught us the lesson of courage and bravery.”
Fazl condemned the politics of cowardice, saying that he curses those who indulge in cowardly politics. He alleged that the establishment has always pitted politicians against each other, so politicians should leave the fight for the chair.
The religious party has launched its anti-government campaign from Pishin district from where the Maulana was elected as a member of the National Assembly.
Describing the rally as the ""Awami Assembly,"" Fazl reaffirmed his commitment to the people's trust despite his absence from Pishin. He thanked them for their unwavering support and cited shared struggles against electoral malpractice.

3,"In letter to CJ, ex-PM seeks judicial intervention to safeguard rule of law","Incarcerated ex-PM draws CJP’s attention on seven issues, says entire nation is looking at him","The incarcerated founding chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Imran Khan, wrote a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa on Saturday and drew his attention to seven key issues that he felt needed urgent intervention by the top court and the top judge to safeguard the rule of law and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution within the country.
In his letter, the former premier has urged the CJP to take notice of NAB giving a clean chit to ex-PM Nawaz Sharif in the Toshakhana case; look into the Bahawalnagar incident; take action on the letter of six high court judges; fix a petition calling for an independent probe into May 9 events; inquire about Commissioner Rawalpindi’s statement regarding poll rigging; take up petitions pertaining to rigging in February 8 general elections; and see how reserved seats have been allocated in national and provincial assemblies.
While drawing CJP’s attention to the seven issues, the PTI supremo reminded him that the entire nation is looking at him and quoted the words of one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time, Albert Einstein: “The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.”
Also read: CJP’s extension issue stirs political chessboard
Through the letter, Khan has conveyed to CJP Isa that the state of the rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution has fallen to new lows in Pakistan under his watch, saying it has caused the gradual emergence of the “law of the jungle and the enactment of the primitive doctrine that might is right.”
“I have no doubt that if our superior judiciary, with your good self at its helm, would not meaningfully intervene as the custodian of the Constitution and the ultimate arbiter of justice, and if the foregoing situation were to prevail,” Imran stated, “it would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.”
He then brought seven matters to CJP Isa’s attention, saying some of which form sub-judice matters of petitions already pending in the Supreme Court, while others involve facts and circumstances that glaringly call for prompt intervention at the judiciary’s own motion, but, in each case, “it has so far been in vain.”
Nawaz’s Toshakhana case
Firstly, Khan’s letter which was officially released by his party states that the CJP should take notice of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB)’s sudden decision to exonerate three-time former premier Nawaz Sharif, saying the case was pursued for years and has now been dropped. Also, he has called for an inquiry against NAB Chairman Nazir Ahmed Butt and sought his removal from office.
Bahawalnagar incident
Secondly, Khan has urged “dear” CJP to look into the Bahawalnagar incident, saying it should serve as an eye opener on the lop-sided state of uniformed vigilante justice in Pakistan. Khan recalled that, for months on end, the police repeatedly crossed every single line known to a civilized society by raiding, vandalizing, and looting the homes of unarmed citizens – mostly PTI workers – and no one came to the rescue of the defenseless men, women, and children. “Disappointingly,” he stated, “our Judiciary, instead of stepping in, has remained a bystander in the face of all these excesses.”
Referring to how women belonging to PTI have so far been treated, Khan’s letter read that this begs the question: “Are the fundamental rights of human dignity and privacy of the home left to be enforced solely by the barrel of the gun, or does the Judiciary retain any semblance of authority to enforce them across the board?”
“The lines drawn by our Constitution between the various pillars of the state are getting blurred into non-existence, and this has to be stopped before it is too late,” the letter read.
Six IHC judges’ letter
Thirdly, Khan has urged the CJP to take action on the letter written by six judges of the Islamabad High Court, complaining about being subjected to blackmail, harassment and coercion by “members of the executive, including operatives of intelligence agencies.”
Recalling how different judges were pressurised, Khan stated that it could not be more ironical that, in this day and age, those who are supposed to provide justice to citizens, those who are duty bound to secure justice for others, are themselves seeking justice. To date, he said, the action taken by the Supreme Court on the subject has been meek and indecisive. By failing the judges, he added, people’s confidence in the justice system, which is undergoing significant erosion already, will stand dismantled and demolished.
Transparent probe in May 9 events
Fourthly, the letter stated that Khan believes that 90 percent of the people incarcerated and facing trial in connection with the May 9 incidents “did not indulge in any violence whatsoever”. The state, however, is acting as judge, jury, and executioner in all these trials. He apprised the CJP that a constitutional petition “calling for an independent, transparent and thorough inquiry into who in fact incited and perpetrated the 9th May violence” has been pending in the Supreme Court since May 25, 2023. “In the interest of complete justice,” he urged, “this case must be fixed and decided upon on a priority basis.”
Where did Commissioner Rawalpindi go?
Fifthly, Khan has referred to the startling press conference of the Commissioner Rawalpindi Division on February 17, 2024, regarding the alleged manipulation of election results on February 8. The PTI founder has asked the CJP to look into the commissioner’s subsequent retraction; whose custody he was in until the point he made it and to where he has disappeared now from public view, saying these are a mystery to all and sundry.
“Stolen mandate”
Sixthly, Khan has drawn the CJP’s attention toward a series of petitions, including one filed by PTI, pressing that, contrary to constitutional stipulations, the general election of February 8, 2024, was “not conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law, and that corrupt practices were not guarded against therein”. He said that petitions have been pending in SC for more than two months now, calling to uphold the rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution by fixing and deciding all those petitions on a priority basis.
Reserved Seats
Lastly, he drew the chief justice’s attention towards the manner in which the subject of allocation of reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies has been handled by the Election Commission of Pakistan, and by speakers of several of the houses concerned. He said the pending petitions on this subject must also be fixed and decided upon on a priority basis in the interest of justice. “Inaction on your part and that of the Supreme Court in the face of each of the aforementioned matters of grave importance,” he stated, “would exacerbate the constitutional crisis the country is already faced with and push it closer and closer to the abyss.”
“Yours faithfully”
Surprisingly, in the letter, Imran reminded the CJP how he faced the wrath of the state in the form of a reference in the Supreme Judicial Council a few years ago – when Khan was the premier. Similarly, he reminded the CJP of the occasion when he spoke to the joint sitting of the parliament on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the enactment of the Constitution of Pakistan, saying a copy of the Constitution was held in hand in full public view before proclaiming that the book was the CJP’s guiding light after the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH).
“As, what I believe to be the majority of our populace, faces the wrath of the state,” Khan concluded, “now is the time for you to prove whether his proclamation of the supremacy of the Constitution is for real “or was mere hollow rhetoric.”

4,Pakistan sweetens terms to lure Saudi investment,"Assures swift repatriation of profits for Saudi investors, ensuring a hassle-free process","Pakistan has presented the enticing prospect of highly profitable returns to attract Saudi investment, with projected rates ranging from an appealing 14% to an astounding 50%. Additionally, Pakistan has assured priority in the repatriation of profits without any hindrances.
According to government sources involved in these discussions, the indicated returns on Saudi investment are expected to allow the Kingdom to recoup its invested capital within a period of three to nine years, depending on the nature of the project.
Pakistan aims to advance the Saudi Arabia investment initiative during the April 27-28 visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who will be accompanied by a team from the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).
During their two-day visit to Pakistan, the Saudi delegation asked maximum questions about projects in the areas of agriculture, mining and Diamer Basha dam, said the sources. These are the areas where the government has indicated maximum returns on the investment.
Although initially eying on a $25 billion bonanza, Pakistan has now adjusted its expectations to a $5 billion investment by June 2025.
One of the concerns of Saudi Arabia was that Pakistan was withholding the repatriation of profits due to external sector liquidity constraints. However, Pakistan assured that Saudi investors would get priority in repatriation of profits, said the sources.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has already given instructions to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to give Saudi Arabian companies preference in repatriation of the profits.
Pakistan allowed $694 million repatriation of the profits during the first eight months of this fiscal year, which was more than double compared to the previous fiscal year but it was still $900 million less than the pre-crisis period.
Despite a liberal and attractive investment regime, Pakistan’s annual foreign direct investment has remained in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. It had earlier offered special incentives to Beijing under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that resulted in a total of $25 billion Chinese inflow, mostly in the shape of loans and a component of investment
While appearing at Express News programme The Review –Pakistan’s only dedicated show on economic affairs – Bilal Azhar Kayani the Member National Assembly of the PML-N, said that the indicated Internal Rate of Returns (IRR) are based on the assumption of the potential investments.
He said that these indicative numbers should not be construed as offers, as the actual returns on the investments would be decided during the technical negotiations.
The maximum 50% return on the investment has been indicated for the Greenfield Mine Development, Khuzdar, project, which is said to be the third largest mining project after Reko Diq and Thar coal, according to the sources.
The government has estimated an initial investment of $154 million and with the 50% IRR, the payback period is projected at five years.
Pakistan has also indicated higher returns on investment in the agriculture sector. It has offered Saudi Arabia to set up a cattle farm in Punjab for 30,000 animals with an annual production of six thousand tons of meat. The initial indicated size of investment is over $25 million and the payback period is just three years with a 34% return on the investment.
The sources said that Saudi Arabia was also interested in getting agricultural land on lease but the details have yet to be finalized. Pakistan pitched Saudi Arabia to acquire 50,000 acres of land on lease for corporate farming.
A government official said that the Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company (SALIC) showed interest in the project and a memorandum of understanding could be signed during the next week's visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to the Kingdom.
The government has indicated a 22% return on the investment in corporate farming with a payback period of only six years, said the sources. The sources said that due to the lack of availability of water corporate farming cannot begin for at least one and a half year.
The profitability for the majority of the projects is estimated in the range of 14% to 15% with some falling in the profitability of 19-20%, said the sources.
The semiconductor development and Chip packaging project is also pitched for Saudi investment of $270 million with an indicated profitability of 17%, said the sources. This project will have a payback period of seven years, they added.
The sources said that Pakistan has indicated that it would dilute 25% shares of the Reko Diq project to Saudi Arabia, which are currently held by three federal government-owned companies. The project is highly capital-intensive.
A $2 billion project for a strategic rail link development connecting Reko Diq mines with Gwadar port has also been offered to Saudi Arabia.
Pakistan has indicated a 20% return on around $1.5 billion investment in the development of the Iron Ore Mining and Steel Mills Complex at Chiniot, Punjab. The project will have a payback period of 9 years, said the sources.
Despite surplus electricity, the government has offered Saudi Arabia to set up a 600MW Solar Park at Kot Adu, Punjab with a $300 million equity investment. The indicated return on the investment is 13-14%, which Pakistani authorities said can be further negotiated.
The government also wants Saudi investment in a 1320 MW Thar Coal power project on a cost-plus tariff basis despite the country not needing any new investment in the power sector. There will be guaranteed dispatch and a 14% return over the investment cost, said the sources. The project will also get tax exemption and protection from political force majeure.
A $680 million transmission line project has also been offered to Saudi Arabia with a 14% return on investment and a payback period of seven years, said the sources.

5,‘Political use of export controls’ tests Pak-US ties,FO reacts after US sanctions target Pakistan’s missiles programme,"In a move that jolted efforts to reset ties between the two countries, the United States on Friday imposed sanctions on four international companies -- three Chinese and one from Belarus -- accusing them of supplying equipment for Pakistan’s ballistic missile program.
Islamabad was quick to reject the move, saying that “political use of export controls” would only lead to an arms race and disturb strategic balance.
The US Department of State designated four entities pursuant to Section 1(a)(ii) of Executive Order 13382, which targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.  
“These entities have supplied missile‐applicable items to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, including its long-range missile program,” read the official statement issued in Washington.
The State Department issued a “fact sheet” while justifying the listing of four entities. It alleged that the Belarus-based Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant worked to supply special vehicle chassis to Pakistan’s long-range ballistic missile program.
“Such chassis are used as launch support equipment for ballistic missiles by Pakistan’s National Development Complex (NDC), which is responsible for the development of Missile Technology Control Regime Category (MTCR) I ballistic missiles,” it noted.
The statement department release further said People’s Republic of China (PRC)-based Xi’an Longde Technology Development Company Limited, supplied missile-related equipment, including a filament winding machine, to Pakistan’s long-range ballistic missile programme that we assess was destined for NDC. Filament winding machines can be used to produce rocket motor cases.
Similarly, China-based Tianjin Creative Source International Trade Co Ltd supplied missile-related equipment to Pakistan’s long-range ballistic missile program, including stir welding equipment (which the United States assesses can be used to manufacture propellant tanks used in space launch vehicles), and a linear accelerator system (which the United States assesses can be used in the inspection of solid rocket motors).
Tianjin Creative’s procurements were likely destined for Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), which develops and produces Pakistan’s MTCR Category I ballistic missiles.
Another Chinese-based Granpect Company Limited, the US claimed,  worked with Pakistan’s SUPARCO to supply equipment for testing of large-diameter rocket motors. In addition, Granpect Co. Ltd. also worked to supply equipment for testing large-diameter rocket motors to Pakistan’s NDC, it alleged.
“As a result of today’s action, and in accordance with E.O. 13382, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC),” according to the statement department.
“Additionally, all individuals or entities that have ownership, either directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. All transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons are prohibited unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC or exempt.”
Reacting to the development, the Foreign Office rejected the US decision, saying such listings of commercial entities had taken place in the past as well on allegations of links to Pakistan's ballistic missile programme without sharing any evidence whatsoever.
“While we are not aware of the specifics of the latest measures by the United States, in the past we have come across many instances where listings have been made on mere suspicion or even when the involved items were not on any control lists but were deemed sensitive under catch-all provisions,” said Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, the foreign ministry spokesperson.
She said Pakistan rejected the political use of export controls. “It is a reality that the same jurisdictions, which claim to exercise strict non-proliferation controls, have waived off licensing requirements for advanced military technologies for some countries. This is leading to arms buildup; accentuating regional asymmetries, and undermining the objectives of non-proliferation and of regional and global peace and security,” the spokesperson warned.
“We have pointed out many times the need to avoid arbitrary application of export controls and for discussions between concerned parties for an objective mechanism to avoid erroneous sanctions on technology needed purely for socio-economic development pursuits. Pakistan has been ready to discuss end-use and end-user verification mechanisms so that legitimate commercial users are not hurt by discriminatory application of export controls.”
She further noted: “We reject political use of export controls. It is well known that the same jurisdictions, that claim strict adherence to non-proliferation controls, have waived off licensing requirements for advanced military technologies for some countries. Such discriminatory approaches and double standards are undermining the credibility of non-proliferation regimes and also the objectives of regional and global peace and security by accentuating military asymmetries.”
This is not the first time the US imposed sanctions on Chinese firms on allegations of helping Pakistan’s missile program. In October 2023, the US banned 3 Chinese firms on similar allegations while in December 2021 another Chinese company faced sanctions.
Observers believe that the US has maintained double standards when it comes to non-proliferation efforts. Interestingly, the latest US move came two days after US Ambassador to Islamabad Donald Blome told Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar that Pakistan’s “security and prosperity” was the US top priority.
Defense experts feel that it is not possible for Pakistan to compromise on its strategic missile program and other arsenals at a time when the US has developed close strategic ties with India and is building its defense capabilities.

6,Pakistan sweetens terms to lure Saudi investment,"Assures swift repatriation of profits for Saudi investors, ensuring a hassle-free process"," 
Pakistan has presented the enticing prospect of highly profitable returns to attract Saudi investment, with projected rates ranging from an appealing 14% to an astounding 50%. Additionally, Pakistan has assured priority in the repatriation of profits without any hindrances.
According to government sources involved in these discussions, the indicated returns on Saudi investment are expected to allow the Kingdom to recoup its invested capital within a period of three to nine years, depending on the nature of the project.
Pakistan aims to advance the Saudi Arabia investment initiative during the April 27-28 visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who will be accompanied by a team from the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).
During their two-day visit to Pakistan, the Saudi delegation asked maximum questions about projects in the areas of agriculture, mining, and Diamer Basha dam, said the sources. These are the areas where the government has indicated maximum returns on the investment.
Although initially eying on a $25 billion bonanza, Pakistan has now adjusted its expectations to a $5 billion investment by June 2025.
One of the concerns of Saudi Arabia was that Pakistan was withholding the repatriation of profits due to external sector liquidity constraints. However, Pakistan assured that Saudi investors would get priority in repatriation of profits, said the sources.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has already given instructions to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to give Saudi Arabian companies preference in repatriation of the profits. Pakistan allowed $694 million repatriation of the profits during the first eight months of this fiscal year, which was more than double compared to the previous fiscal year but it was still $900 million less than the pre-crisis period.
Despite a liberal and attractive investment regime, Pakistan’s annual foreign direct investment has remained in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. It had earlier offered special incentives to Beijing under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that resulted in a total of $25 billion in Chinese inflow, mostly in the shape of loans and a component of investment
While appearing at the Express News program The Review –Pakistan’s only dedicated show on economic affairs – Bilal Azhar Kayani Member National Assembly of the PML-N, said that the indicated Internal Rate of Returns (IRR) is based on the assumption of the potential investments.
He said that these indicative numbers should not be construed as offers, as the actual returns on the investments would be decided during the technical negotiations.
The maximum 50% return on the investment has been indicated for the Greenfield Mine Development, Khuzdar, project, which is said to be the third largest mining project after Reko Diq and Thar coal, according to the sources.The government has estimated an initial investment of $154 million and with the 50% IRR, the payback period is projected at five years.
Pakistan has also indicated higher returns on investment in the agriculture sector. It has offered Saudi Arabia to set up a cattle farm in Punjab for 30,000 animals with an annual production of six thousand tons of meat. The initial indicated size of investment is over $25 million and the payback period is just three years with a 34% return on the investment.
The sources said that Saudi Arabia was also interested in getting agricultural land on lease but the details have yet to be finalized. Pakistan pitched Saudi Arabia to acquire 50,000 acres of land on lease for corporate farming.
A government official said that the Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company (SALIC) showed interest in the project and a memorandum of understanding could be signed during the next week's visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to the Kingdom.
The government has indicated a 22% return on the investment in corporate farming with a payback period of only six years, said the sources. The sources said that due to the lack of availability of water corporate farming cannot begin for at least one and a half years.
The profitability for the majority of the projects is estimated in the range of 14% to 15% with some falling in the profitability of 19-20%, said the sources.
The semiconductor development and Chip packaging project is also pitched for Saudi investment of $270 million with an indicated profitability of 17%, said the sources. This project will have a payback period of seven years, they added. The sources said that Pakistan has indicated that it would dilute 25% shares of the Reko Diq project to Saudi Arabia, which are currently held by three federal government-owned companies. The project is highly capital-intensive.
A $2 billion project for a strategic rail link development connecting Reko Diq mines with Gwadar port has also been offered to Saudi Arabia.
Pakistan has indicated a 20% return on around $1.5 billion investment in the development of the Iron Ore Mining and Steel Mills Complex at Chiniot, Punjab. The project will have a payback period of 9 years, said the sources.
Despite surplus electricity, the government has offered Saudi Arabia to set up a 600MW Solar Park at Kot Adu, Punjab with a $300 million equity investment. The indicated return on the investment is 13-14%, which Pakistani authorities said can be further negotiated.
The government also wants Saudi investment in a 1320 MW Thar Coal power project on a cost-plus tariff basis despite the country not needing any new investment in the power sector. There will be guaranteed dispatch and a 14% return over the investment cost, said the sources. The project will also get tax exemption and protection from political force majeure.
A $680 million transmission line project has also been offered to Saudi Arabia with a 14% return on investment and a payback period of seven years, said the sources.
