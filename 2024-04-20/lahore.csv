Sardar Zafar Hussain, president of the Kisan Board Pakistan,  announced at a press conference here on Friday that demonstrations would  be held at all district headquarters and other major towns in the  province to make the government procure at least five million tonnes of  wheat in the current season and that grain support price be raised from  current Rs3,900 to Rs5,000 per 40kg.
Flanked by Akhtar Farooq Meo  and Mian Rashid Minhala, he alleged that the government was deliberately  delaying the wheat procurement campaign because of which the prices of  grain in the open market were on the decline.
He demanded that the  government should not only increase the official support price to  Rs5,000 per 40 but also enhance its procurement target from 2m tonnes to  5m tonnes to stabilize the local market.
He lamented that farm  input prices had more than doubled in the last one year or so but the  farmers were being forced to sell their produce at the last year rates  and even lower than that.
He claimed that the fertiliser companies  had increased by Rs600 per bag the urea rate four days ago though no  new tax had been imposed on any ingredient of the fertiliser or on the  companies.

1,Over Rs100m scam: 19 Gepco officials set free after surrendering embezzled amount,Officials were accused of making fake entries of electricity bills recovery into the record.,"GUJRAT: At least 19 officials of the Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco) have been discharged in a case of embezzlement of Rs100.5 million after they deposited the embezzled amounts into the national exchequer on Friday.
However, the man accused in the case was again handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on a three-day physical remand in the same case.
The FIA had registered a case against at least 26 senior Gepco officials, while 20 of them were arrested on April 17 the last.
Earlier, on Friday, an FIA team produced all the 20 suspects, belonging to revenue and accounts sections of Gepco’s Gujranwala headquarters, in a court after their two-day physical remand was completed.
The investigation officer informed the court that the FIA had no objection if the suspects are discharged from the case as they had deposited the entire amount of Rs100.5m into the Gepco’s respective accounts.
At this, 19 out of the 20 suspects were discharged from the case, while the prime accused, Naeem, who is a commercial assistant in the company, was again handed over to the FIA on a three-day physical remand.
These officials were accused of making fake entries of electricity bills recovery into the record, and instead of depositing the recovered amounts into the official accounts, they would embezzle it.
The matter was referred to the FIA’s Gujranwala directorate by the senior hierarchy of Gepco headquarters after an initial departmental probe.
These officials were arrested when they arrived at the FIA police station after being summoned for investigation.
However, the Gepco Officers’ Association and Hydro Labour Union had also lodged a protest demonstration against the arrests.
The Gepco officials had also suspended the electricity supply to FIA headquarters in protest against these arrests, accusing the agency of defaulting on payment of Rs6.8m to the company.
However, sources in the FIA had denied the charge and said that the federal agency had regularly been paying its electricity bills every month.
The power supply to the FIA offices had been restored within a few hours of suspension.
A senior FIA official told Dawn that the agency had to further investigate the main accused for which his physical remand was sought. The remaining suspects in the case have been set free after being discharged from the case, he added.

Qaisera Elahi, the wife of the former chief minister, filed a petition before the court alleging harassment at the hands of the police.

He alleged that Elahi’s voters, supporters and family members were also being harassed by the police officials. The counsel asked the court to order the police not to conduct illegal raids or make arrests and obstruct Elahi’s election campaign.
Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan disposed of the petition with a direction to the Gujrat district police officer to ensure no harassment is caused to the petitioner’s family and voters of her husband.

4,CM Maryam visited Kartarpur by copter: Punjab government,Spokesperson says case registered over youth’s death; police say inquiry launched against driver of ‘official vehicle’.,"NAROWAL: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz visited Kartarpur on Thursday via helicopter and she was not travelling with a motorcade at the time of an accident, which claimed the life of a youth in Narowal, the provincial government said on Friday.
In a statement, a spokesperson said the CM had taken notice of the youth’s death and ordered immediate action, issuing directions for the identification of the car involved in the accident and the arrest of the culprits.
The spokesperson said that police, on the orders of the CM, had registered a case and launched an investigation into the man’s death.
According to initial reports and eyewitness accounts, 23-year-old filling station worker Muhammad Abubakar had died after allegedly being hit by an Elite Force vehicle, said to be part of the chief minister’s convoy.

Spox says case registered over youth’s death; police say inquiry launched against driver of ‘official vehicle’

The incident took place at the Chandowal Stop on the Shakargarh Road, en route to Kartarpur, where the CM had attended Baisakhi celebrations on the same day. The government, however, has rejected these reports.
Meanwhile, Abubakar was laid to rest in his native village following funeral prayers.
Narowal DSP Malik Muhammad Khalil said they had obtained the CCTV footage of the incident, claiming that Abubakar could be seen fell on the ground after being hit by an unidentified motorcyclist before he had a fatal collision with a government vehicle.
DPO Naveed Malik said the search was on for the unidentified motorcyclist, but so far they had not got any information about him. He claimed that a departmental inquiry had been launched against the driver of the government vehicle that hit Abubakar.
DC Syed Hasan Raza said a proposal had been sent to the government for financial support of the family of the deceased.
But Ali Rizwan, a cousin of the deceased, told Dawn nobody from the government contacted the family.

5,SC urged to regulate high court chief justices’ power,"The federal government, the Ministry of Law, and all provincial high courts through their registrars have been made respondents in the petition.","LAHORE: The Supreme Court has been requested to regulate the discretionary powers of all provincial high courts’ chief justices to curb the alleged misuse of authority in the judiciary. 
“The outgoing chief justices often misuse their discretionary powers like royalty,” says a petition filed by a lawyer in the wake of alleged dozens of decisions made by Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti, the former chief justice of the Lahore High Court, during the last 30 days of his tenure. 
The federal government, the Ministry of Law, and all provincial high courts through their registrars have been made respondents in the petition. Petitioner Mian Dawood says the former chief justice approved illegal increments for hundreds of employees of the LHC in the name of good performance. 
He said from July 6, 2021, onwards, two illegal advance increments were given to the officials of the LHC. No chief justice has ever given such increments to the staff, including the registrar, for a period of over one year in judicial history, the lawyer claims. He pointed out that the former chief justice granted four-year paid educational leave to the reader (the court associate) of his court. 
He said the reader’s spouse, who is a senior civil judge, was also extended the same favor without any record of university enrollment or law department requisition. The petitioner alleged that over 50 notifications were issued in a day to end the penalties of as many employees of the LHC. 
He argued that withdrawing any penalty under the discretionary powers is tantamount to disbanding the service tribunals established under the law. He said that the former chief justice not only withdrew the penalties of two deputy registrars of the LHC but also granted them advance increments and promotions. 
He said the former chief justice issued most of the notifications a day before his retirement on March 6. He said the discretionary powers should not be exercised by an individual (chief justice) rather administrative committees of the high courts be given the powers. He asked the apex court to regulate the discretionary powers of all high courts’ chief justices and set aside the notifications issued by the former chief justice of the LHC by ‘misusing’ his discretion.

6,Heads of CAA and PSB changed,"Govt has already announced outsourcing airports in Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi in a bid to attract foreign direct investment.","LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif government on Friday removed the heads of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB).
According to a notification of the Cabinet Secretariat Establishment Division, “with the approval of the federal government, retired Flt-Lt. Khaqan Murtaza, a BS-21 officer of Pakistan Administrative Service, presently posted as Director General of CAA is transferred and posted as Chairman of Employees Old Age Benefits Institution (EOBI) under Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development Division in terms of section 8A(1) of the Employees Old Age Benefits Act 1976 and under section 10 of the Civil Servants Act 1973 with immediate effect and until further orders.”
Mr Murtaza had assumed the DG CAA charge in Nov 2020.
According to source, the government is considering the name of retired Air Vice Marshal Sajid Habib for the slot of the DG CAA.
The government has already announced outsourcing airports in Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi in a bid to attract foreign direct investment and provide “world-class facilities” to passengers. The government is keen to implement its privatization policy in the CAA and other under-performing government units/departments.
On the other hand, the Director General Shoaib Khoso lost his job in a row between his department, Pakistan Sports Board (PSB), with it administrative ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC).
The IPC ministry terminated the contract of Khoso on Friday and the Establishment Division issued a notification in this regard. The ED also assigned the additional charge of DG PSB to Zahoor Ahmed, a BS-21 officer of Secretariat Group presently working as additional secretary in the IPC ministry for a period of three months. Earlier this week, after the return of Khoso, PSB challenged the authority of secretary IPC and termed the postings, assigning look-after charge in the board by the ministry as contradictory to the Establishment Division’s rules.
In the letter sent to the Secretary IPC on April 15, the Deputy Director General (Admin) of PSB Mansoor Ahmed Khan stated that while the DG PSB was on ex-Pakistan leave, the ministry assigned the charge to a junior officer of BS-19.
The letter termed this as against the Management Pay Scale Police approved by the Prime Minister that provides that “the current charge/additional charge of the position of Heads of Autonomous Bodies in MP-Scales only be granted to a civil or government servants of equivalent grade and that too with the approval of appointing authority which is the Prime Minister of Pakistan.”
It further said that the officer who had been assigned the look-after charge “requisitioned the services of various officers on deputation basis for PSB which is purely an administrative matter which also involved financial implications. Such decision does not fall in the ambit of look-after charge range, therefore, is violative of clarification of the Establishment Division.”
Sarfraz Rasoo, an Assistant Engineer of the PSB on April 17 challenged the posting transfers made in the Board by the acting DG PSB and the Islamabad High Court (IHC) issued a stay order in this regard. The appointment of DG PSB was also subjudice before the IHC, however, the IPC ministry terminated his service contract “by paying one month’s salary in lieu of one month notice, with immediate effect.”

Shahzad Farooq, an SIC candidate in the by-poll from NA-119, filed a writ petition against the district government and the police for denying permission to hold an election rally.
The petitioner’s counsel stated that the DC did not grant permission for the rally at Shalimar Chowk. He said by denying the permission, the government violated the petitioner’s constitutional rights.
He alleged that the candidate of the ruling party was being supported and favoured by the government machinery. He asked the court to grant permission to hold an election rally at Shalimar Chowk.
A Punjab government’s lawyer argued that due to the crowded nature of the Shalimar Chowk, permission for the rally was not granted. However, he said, permission could be given for a rally at Garhi Shahu or Co-Op Store Chowk.
Justice Rasaal Hassan Syed remarked that holding rallies was a constitutional right of every political party. He directed the petitioner to suggest alternative places for the rally to the DC.
The petitioner’s lawyer expressed satisfaction saying arrangements for the rally would be made wherever the DC grants permission.
The judge directed the DC to decide the application of the petitioner strictly under the law.

8,T.E. Lawrence and writing back from Lahore,"LAHORE: A play, Lawrence in Lahore: the Lost Years, has taken up the subject of the life of the spy that the British...","LAHORE: A play, Lawrence in Lahore: the Lost Years, has taken up the subject of the life of the spy that the British called military strategist Col T.E. Lawrence and his years spent in colonial Lahore. 
Written by Fawzia Afzal-Khan and Shahid Nadeem, a staged reading-cum-performance of the play was held at the Lawrence Hall of the Quaid-i-Azam Library at the Lawrence Gardens on Wednesday.  
The three-act play begins with the Paris Peace Conference attended by the heads of states of England, France, Italy and the US at Versailles, France, in 1919 after the fall of the Ottoman Empire and then moves to the RAF base at Drigh Road, Karachi, where Lawrence was posted as a clerk despite having a higher rank in the army. The subsequent action happens in Lahore with the arrival of Lawrence in the city.  
Dubbed as ‘the decolonial spy thriller of our times’ by the writers and production, the play portrays Lawrence as a character poles apart from his portrayal in the movie, Lawrence of Arabia, that won seven Academy Awards. While the film presents him as a hero, the play gives another perspective, an attempt of the ‘empire writing back’. 
While the canvas of the story is huge, the writers have done well by squeezing it in three acts while maintaining the unity of the plot that can be divided in two parts – the conspiracies of a cunning British spy who disguises himself at will to cheat the leaders and people in India and Afghanistan and his love life and marriage with Akbar Jehan, the daughter of the owner of the famous Nedous Hotel in Lahore.  
Lahore of yore 
While the conspiracies of Lawrence are presented with skill, the history of Lahore was also shown through audio-visual effects, especially its two famous hotels, the Arab Hotel and Nedous Hotel, where the action happens.  
About the Arab Hotel, KK Aziz in his book, the Coffee House of Lahore, writes, “for those orientalists of the 1920s the Mall was too westernised, distant and costly. By chance, they started patronsing a small, unclean restaurant on Railway Road, opposite the gate of Islamia College. A clean-shaved but dirty Arab from Kuwait, known as Bhai Aboud, ran the shop and was happy to serve kebabs and tea to his intelligentsia even on doubtful credit”. 
A Hameed in his book, Lahore Ki Yadain, mentions Hasrat, Noon Meem Rashed, Akhtar Shirani, Krishn Chander as regulars of the hotel. 
“It was Hasrat who was the life of the party. Arab Hotel was the hub of Lahore’s intellectual activity. News reached Arab Hotel before it hit newspaper offices,” he writes. 
About the Nedous Hotel, US-based scholar Dr Nyla Ali Khan, writes, “my grandmother Akbar Jehan’s paternal grandfather, Michael Adam Nedou started out as a photographer and architect, but destiny had willed otherwise. The decisions that he took shaped that destiny as though with the finesse of a calligrapher’s brush. His first venture in hoteliering was the acquisition of the Sind Punjab Hotel in the port city of Karachi. He built the imposing and courtly Nedous Hotel in Lahore, characterized by charm and grace, in the 1870s.”  
In an article, she mentioned that her grandmother Akbar Jehan’s father’s family, the ‘Nedous’, had emigrated from Dubrovnik, Croatian city on the Dalmatian coast of the Adriatic Sea, to Lahore in the 1800s. At the time of his nutralisation, Michael Adam Nedou explained that he was born in Ragusa, Austria (Ragusa is the Italian and Latin name for Dubrovnik on the Dalmatian Coast). 
During his time in Lahore and north India, Lawrence has been shown in the play as a cunning man who changes his name to T.E. Shaw and Pir Karam Shah (as he could speak Arabic) at ease, especially when he instigated the Afghan tribes against anti-British King Amanullah of Afghanistan. He gets into a relationship with 17-year-old Akbar Jehan, the daughter of Nedou’s owner. 
Talking about the play, Fawzia says issues of Middle East and Palestine started in the times of Lawrence were open and out now. She said the colonial forces led to the long standing issue of India and Pakistan also, including that of Kashmir. “All these topics have been touched in the play.”  
The play ends with the end of marriage of Lawrence with Jehan with the divorce forcibly taken by her father by involving Gama Pehlwan. Besides the legendary wrester, Bhagat Singh’s character had also been included in the plot, perhaps an attempt to bring in more familiarity for the audiences. 
Writer and actor Navid Shahzad said the play related the contemporary world with the times of Lawrence when the US, Israel, France, Germany and Jordan were on the scene. “Divide and rule has always been a policy of the empires and it’s still in play.”  
She also talked about Akbar Jehan and her family and how her father fell for a Kashmiri milkmaid and married her. Jehan was studying at the Convent of Murree and came to Lahore on vacations. It was time when Lawrence, after his conspiracies in Afghanistan, had come to Lahore, and fell in love with Jehan.  
Comparing the character of Lawrence with Ali (played by Omar Sharif) in the movie, Lawrence of Arabia, she said “that’s how the west always looked at the Arabs, the Semite and us—always a black and white situation. The English had a kind of arrogance towards our culture, our languages and way of life which was called pure savagery and they considered themselves as carrying out a god’s mission to correct and heal us.”  
Shahzad said the play left the audience offended at times but this was accepted as our chequered history.  
The issue of language 
Prof Shaista Sonnu Sirajjuddin spoke in Punjabi, saying that a lot had been said about what the British did to us and what’s happening in Palestine now but our biggest trouble (maar) was the English language itself. “The process of the language-induced troubles continues till date. But we are persistent with it very stubbornly and include it in our plays.” Using the Punjabi word dheet for the Pakistani people, she used a pun, translating dheet as ‘resilience’ and ‘tenaciousness’. She congratulated the actors and ended her comments, saying she won’t prolong the punishment for the audience by speaking more Punjabi.  
Earlier, to the question of the language of the play being in English and not in any local language, Shahid Nadeem said “we always had this idea that it’s the content, story and desired audiences that determine the language and venue of the play”. He said the story was such and it had international interest. He said the Urdu translation of the play would be staged at the end of this year. 
The actors included Dr Sameer Ahmad, Yusra Irfan, Dara Hashmi, Sameer Afzal, Ehssn Kareem, Sohaib Nasir, Fatima Abbas, Uswa Amjad, Hassan Atif, Jazib, Ahmad Tajy, Hammad, Hassan, and Waqas. The play was a collaboration among GCU, Kinnaird College and Ajoka.

These were concluding remarks made at the second day of the annual conference by the Lahore School of Economics on “Management of the Pakistan Economy” which focused on issues of innovation, female employment, skills development of workers and Pakistani trade.
Dr Rabia Arif of the LSE looked at how innovation in the textile sector, the light engineering sector and the automotive sector differs. She found that most of the textile manufacturers surveyed were exporters engaged in product innovation to increase revenues and decrease costs.
In the light engineering sector, firms engage in process and marketing innovations but this leads to higher costs and lower revenues. In the automotive sector, larger firms engage in product and marketing innovations to increase their revenues.
“The results showed that innovation in the textile sector, which is an export-intensive sector, tend to be different from innovations in the light engineering and automotive sectors which mostly cater to the domestic market,” she said.
Dr. Hamna Ahmed and Zunia Tirmazee of the Lahore School of Economics and Rebecca Wu of the University of Chicago discussed the impact of a training initiative by the Punjab Skills Development Fund which focused on providing access to online training courses for workers in rural and urban Punjab. They found that workers who had completed online training courses transitioned into work more than those who did not, and also gained more income after completing the courses.
Dr Zunia Saif Tirmazee of LSE and Sakina Shibuya from the University of Wisconsin discussed the factors that may hinder firms from hiring women. They looked at the impact of social norms as well as economic factors like the cost of transportation for women and the cost of training for women in firms.LSE Rector Dr. Shahid Amjad Chaudhry concluded the moot with a discussion of how the dramatic fall in Pakistan’s growth rate, with almost zero per cent growth last year and an expected growth of only two per cent this year, has led to an increase in poverty and how transfers to low income households through programmes like the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) must be significantly increased to help lower income households.
He also discussed how the provinces must take the lead role in development and economic growth, by investing in health and education and increasing productivity.

He  said that Punjab food department and the Passco have reduced the wheat procurement target by  more than half this year, as compared to the last year’s, due to which the farmers  are worried.
He warned that if the Punjab government did not  revise the wheat purchase target, the growers would face a severe  financial crisis as they had been buying fertilisers and other inputs for wheat cultivation at higher rates because of hoarding.

Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza passed the order on a contempt petition by Dehrki Sugar Mills, challenging the government failure to allocate funds for the subsidy despite a court order.
Assistant Attorney General Sheraz Zaka presented a letter of the commerce ministry written to the finance division for the release of Rs1.3bn funds to the sugar mills regarding exports made during the former prime minister Imran Khan’s tenure.
The law officer stated that due to the paucity of funds the finance division was unable to release this colossal amount.
Justice Mirza lamented that the state could spend lavishly on frivolous things, but was, unfortunately, unable to release subsidy to sugar mills.
Advocate Shahzad Elahi, the counsel for the petitioner, said it had been more than four years since the sugar mills’ owners exported their stock.
The judge directed the federation and the director general of Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) to take up necessary measures with the finance division and the commerce ministry for the allocation of funds regarding sugar export subsidy in the next budget.
The judge adjourned the proceedings till June 11.

15,"PFSA report refutes rape, pregnancy in Maria case","TOBA TEK SINGH: In a surprising development, a DNA test report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA)...","TOBA TEK SINGH: In a surprising development, a DNA test report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) laboratory in the Maria murder case received by Toba Saddar shows that the girl was neither raped nor was she pregnant as it was alleged earlier.  
Maria was murdered by her father Abdul Sattar and brother Faisal at Chak 477-JB Allowal on March 17. Her body was exhumed for autopsy on March 28 after a video of the crime went viral on social media and received large-scale outcry. 
The main accused, Faisal, had admitted in his statement on camera recorded by media persons in police custody on March 31, a day after his arrest, that he had raped and strangled his sister to hide his incest with her.  
However, after this new development and PFSA report, police have now mentioned in the FIR and challan of the case that the girl was murdered by her father and brother in the name of honour and the FIR previously registered under sections 302, 34 and 201 of the PPC had been amended and Section 311 (honour killing) had also been inducted in it.  
Earlier, the police officials involved in investigation had said that both the suspects had raped the girl and they strangled her to hide their incest as she was four months pregnant. The DNA report denies any pregnancy.  
A police officer confirmed that the viral video in which Faisal was seen strangling his sister was proven in the forensic analysis. Both the accused were in the district jail on 14 days judicial remand.  
Faisal’s brother Shahbaz and his wife Sumaira are also in jail in a separate case on the charge of hiding the murder from police. They had told the police that Maria had told them a day before her killing that Faisal and their father, Abdul Sattar, had raped her. Shahbaz had claimed that he had secretly made video of murder by pretending to be talking to his other sister, Kausar, on the phone.  
Due to Faisal’s on-camera statement recorded in custody, police had booked a senior journalist, Rana Khalid Mahmood, and his cameraman, Ali Ahmad, for unlawfully recording an interview of the suspect and posting it on social media.  
Senior lawyer and former vice president of Lahore High Court Bar Association Mian Muhammad Aslam told this correspondent that Maria was murdered on March 17 and buried on March 18 but her body was exhumed about two weeks after her murder. He said so many days after the incident, it was impossible to confirm through swabs in the forensic test by the PFSA whether she was raped or not as most parts of dead bodies would decay in so many days. 
GAS THEFT: The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) got a case registered against three persons for pilfering gas at Gojra.
The pilferage was detected by an anti-theft squad of SNGPL on Friday.
SNGPL Foreman Rafiqur Rehman said in the FIR registered by Gojra Sadar police that the suspects -- Abdul Ghaffar, Yasir and Arshad -- had been pilfering gas through illegal connections from the main line without meters.
Police are conducting raids to arrest the suspects who had fled after detection of gas theft.
