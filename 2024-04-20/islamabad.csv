The seminar on ‘E-commerce and trade fair participation for women entrepreneurs’ was held at the district council hall in Attock. 
The event brought together women entrepreneurs from various business sectors, development partners and governmental representatives to discuss challenges faced by women entrepreneurs in rural and urban areas. 
The speakers on the occasion said development of an exclusive women entrepreneurship policy and action plan would be game changers in economic development of Pakistan.
Officials of TDAP said that with the support of Attock Women’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry, traditional handicrafts, furs, jewellery, food items, including groundnuts and olives, can be introduced at international trade fairs which would not only benefit the local community but would also fetch demand from international buyers.
Dubai-based banker Rehman Gul Khattak, well-known businessman Sheikh Rehan Mehmood, senior Vice President AWCCI Saima Jabin, Vice President Shamaila Sarfaraz, Executive Committee members Sameran Naseer, Rizwana Nadeem, Shakeela Parveen, Henna Jabin, Lubni Mansab, General Secretary Mohammad Arsalan, former presidents Iram Khan, Najea Bibi, PPP women wing district president HajraTabbasum and more than 60 entrepreneurs from the district besides a large number of female students were present.
Assistant director services TDAP Adil Mukhtar deliberated upon market and product research, product development, business modelling, company tax registration, marketing tools, export-related procedures, logistics and payment processes. 
He also spoke about the incentives being provided by the authority to empower women to join trade. 
Dr Arfa Shahid, assistant director women entrepreneurs’ division TDAP, stated that over the years TDAP had organised more than 60 women specific local exhibitions, sent many women entrepreneurs to international exhibitions and sponsored solo women exhibitions internationally and also held multiple seminars and conferences.
President of AWCCI Saba William said the chamber was working to promote women entrepreneurship to drive economic growth, channelise home-based and micro-businesses to venture at commercial level and explore their roots in international markets. 
Saarc Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chairperson Henna Mansab Khan said readymade garments, wooden furniture, salt, gems and jewellery and handicrafts were linked with women businesses which needed to be channelised to give a quantum jump to exports as non-traditional items direly needed in traditional and non-traditional markets. 
She stressed the need to develop a database of women entrepreneurs and identify areas in which they were mostly concentrated. 
She urged the need to provide guidance to women chambers on improving their members’ knowledge, vision, access to resources besides advising women entrepreneurs to join relevant trade associations to stay in touch with latest trends and opportunities.

11,Middle East conflict could alter balance of power: speakers,"ISLAMABAD: The unfolding developments in the Middle East are reshaping the regional dynamics, giving rise to new...","ISLAMABAD: The unfolding developments in the Middle East are reshaping the regional dynamics, giving rise to new geopolitical realities with significant implications for regional stability and power structures, which could fundamentally alter the balance of power and influence across the region, speakers at a roundtable discussion said on Friday.
The discussion titled: ‘Israel’s Gaza Genocide: Specter of a Widening War’ was hosted by Islamabad Policy Institute to dissect the escalating conflicts in the region, particularly focusing on Israel’s slaughter in Gaza and Israel – Iran military exchanges, according to a press release issued by the think-tank.
The participants were of the view that the redefining of regional power dynamics has prompted a critical reevaluation of strategies by key stakeholders.
Dr Shireen Mazari, while opening the debate as the chair of the session, said that “US had been setting the stage for the widening conflict for a while in terms of providing the strategic environment on the ground by not fulfilling the responsibility to protect, and allowing blatant violations of genocide convention, humanitarian law, Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and gathering of military alliances on the ground.”
She regretted the silence of Muslim countries, especially the Arab world on the massacre in Gaza and warned that if these countries that are at the “crux of the evolving new world” do not act proactively by accepting the new reality, they would suffer for not keeping up with the changing times.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed said the events that started with ‘Toofan Al-Aqsa’ on Oct 7 have jolted the Western led security architecture in the region and three new realities have emerged in the shape of shattering of the status quo in the Middle East that had been built by Israel and US; resurgence of terrorism both by state and non-state actors; and intensification of the new cold war unleashed by US against China, Russia and Iran.
He said that in the new situation Israel has on the one hand lost the war in Gaza politically, legally and morally as its genocide has rallied the Global South in support of Palestine; it has on the other buried Modi-Biden’s India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor under “the rubble of Gaza”.
Mr Syed said that though chances of aggravation of conventional direct conflict between Iran and Israel were dim, there was a greater worry that ‘shadow war’ between the two would intensify. He believed one of the ways Israel would try to destabilise Iran would be to exploit its ethnic minorities, which could in turn affect Iran-Pakistan ties as well.
Senator Farhatullah Babar, while talking about the start of a direct conflict between Israel and Iran, said that Iran’s reply has broken the myth of invincibility of Israel by sending a strong message that no matter how sophisticated are the air defenses of the Zionist state, targets can still be hit.
He argued that though Iran’s retaliation against the missile strike on its Damascus Consulate and Israel’s counter attack in Isfahan early Friday morning have been symbolic with both sides showing restraint in executing them, Tehran has successfully demonstrated its capability to respond to provocations.
Senator Afrasiab Khattak expressed his fear that the rise of extremism because of the aggravating conflict in the Middle East would affect Pakistan and its neighbourhood the most. He proposed that Pakistan should, therefore, continue with China Pakistan Economic Corridor, strengthen ties with Iran and change its Afghanistan policy for safeguarding its interests in the evolving situation.
Mr Khattak said Iran has won this round of the conflict by delaying recognition of Israel by Arab states and highlighting the Palestinian crisis.
