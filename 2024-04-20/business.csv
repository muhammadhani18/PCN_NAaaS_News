0,Pakistan can be $3tr economy by 2047: Aurangzeb,Urges Moody’s to upgrade the country’s credit rating soon.,"WASHINGTON: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has stated that Pakistan’s economy has the potential to grow from over $300 billion at present to $3 trillion by 2047.
The minister underscored the country’s desire to grow out of its current economic troubles and to establish itself as a robust economy at a roundtable this week on “Implementing for Faster Results and Greater Impact” organised by the World Bank.
A statement issued by his office on Friday said he conveyed his conviction to enhance the national economy while referring to a 2022 World Bank report dubbed “From Swimming in the Sand to High and Sustainable Growth”. The report laid out a clear roadmap for Pakistan to become a high middle-income country by 2047.
The minister emphasised the World Bank’s focus on climate change, digitalisation, and human development aligned with government priorities. He also appreciated the launching of a single platform to enhance the operational effectiveness of the bank.
Mr Aurangzeb, who represented Pakistan at the spring meetings of the World Bank group in Washington this week, has also urged Moody’s Investor Service to upgrade the country’s credit rating soon.

Urges Moody’s to upgrade the country’s credit rating soon

The government hopes that financial institutions will also take note of Pakistan’s reinforced economic fundamentals and commitment to reforms and will do a favourable reassessment of the Pakistani economy.
The minister expressed his optimism during a meeting with Moody’s representatives in Washington, held on the sidelines of the spring meetings. While the meetings concluded on Friday, the minister remains in Washington for bilateral discussions with US officials and other counterparts.
In its last assessment in February, the credit rating agency defended its decision to downgrade the ratings, citing concerns about Pakistan’s liquidity and external position. Characterising Pakistan’s situation as “increasingly fragile”, with heightened default risks, Moody’s assigned the country a Caa3 rating.
During his meetings with Moody’s representatives, the finance minister shared insights on economic indicators, telling them that recent reforms have had a stabilising impact on the national economy.
He also highlighted the government’s priorities, which include tax reforms, energy sector overhaul, and privatisation agenda, said a statement issued by his office.
The minister “expressed intent to access international capital markets, focusing on the Middle East and China” and addressed concerns on inflation, foreign exchange reserves, debt repayments, external account vulnerability, and domestic liquidity“, the statement added.
He told Moody’s that “he expects a credit rating upgrade soon, fostering confidence in Pakistan’s economic trajectory”.
Pakistan’s current $3 billion IMF arrangement concludes this month, and Islamabad is working to secure a new deal by May. It is seeking a longer and larger package, aiming for $6 billion to $8 billion over three years.
While specifics on loan size remain undisclosed, Pakistan plans to request additional financing under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust.
“We expect the IMF mission to be in Islamabad around the middle of May — and that is when some of these contours will start developing,” the minister told Reuters after meetings with senior IMF and US officials.
In his interview with Reuters, Mr Aurangzeb underlined positive trends in foreign exchange reserves and debt rollovers, projecting a robust fiscal outlook.
“The bulk of our bilateral debt — including our China debt — is being rolled over, so in that sense, I think we are in good shape and I don’t see a big issue during this fiscal year nor the next fiscal year,” he said. But the minister also acknowledged that Pakistan needs to repay roughly $25bn dollars every fiscal year.

The weekly inflation hit a record 48.35pc year-on-year in early May 2023, but then decelerated as low as 24.4pc in late Aug 2023 before surging past 40pc during the week ending on Nov 16, 2023.
The items whose prices increased week-on-week incl­uded potatoes (17.­07pc), tomatoes (12.67pc), chicken (11.60pc), lawn printed and shirting (3.55pc) each, garlic (2.88pc), diesel (2.87pc), beef (2.56pc), georgette (1.91pc), pulse mash (1.62pc), cooked beef (1.31pc) and sugar (1.10pc).

2,Economic optimism tosses PSX to all-time high,Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation says the bullish trend is based on a strong earnings outlook and deliberation over privatising state-owned enterprises.,"KARACHI: Snapping the three-day bearish spell on Friday despite mounting geopolitical tensions, the Pakistani stocks staged a surprise robust rally, tossing the benchmark KSE 100 index near 71,000.
Speaking to Dawn, Arif Habib Ltd Head of Research Tahir Abbas said the ongoing process to secure another bailout package was the key bullish factor as staying in the IMF programme would ensure the sustainability of meeting the country’s external debt repayment obligations and keeping the current account in better shape.
“Pakistan should stay in the IMF programme as it boosts investor confidence in the economic direction and places the country in a better position to deal with current account and debt management issues more conveniently as it would also open up inflows from other multilateral lenders and friendly countries fulfilling crucial financing needs,” Mr Abbas remarked.
He added that the government has been making all economic decisions on merit, fuelling bullish sentiments in the stock market.
More importantly, Mr Abbas said, the valuations of scrips are still highly attractive even though the benchmark index has crossed an unprecedented level of 70,000 during the current week.
“Historically, PSX maintains a price-to-earning (P/E) ratio of 6 against the current 4.2,” he said, explaining the P/E ratio is a benchmark that measures a firm’s current share price relative to its income per share.
The market has performed robustly in the last six months, surging almost 60pc. However, its P/E ratio is still attractive, so investors, especially foreign ones, continued across-the-board value-hunting.
Topline Securities Ltd Chief Executive Muhammad Suhail told Dawn that the news that Saudi Arabia moved closer to buying a $1 bn stake in Reko Diq triggered aggressive buying, taking the PSX to another record closing. Moreover, steady SBP forex reserves despite the $1bn Eurobond payment signalled that the external account is relatively better.
“Locals got huge cash liquidity after Rs6bn buying of Pak Suzuki shares by their sponsors and now it seems they are re-investing in other stocks,” he added.
Hub Power, Engro Fertilisers, Meezan Bank, Bank Al-Habib, and Oil and Gas Development Company made a major positive contribution to the index, cumulatively contributing 329 points.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the bullish trend is based on a strong earnings outlook and deliberation over privatising state-owned enterprises.
“The bullish trend is realistic owing to external account stability after reduction in current account deficit to $1bn for July-February FY24, falling CPI inflation to 20.7pc for March hinting SBP key policy rate cut in coming months,” he observed. He added that the surge in global crude oil prices amid geopolitical tensions and the finance minister’s ruling out significant devaluation with the IMF deal played a catalyst role in the record close.
Speaking to Dawn, Pak-Kuwait Investment Company Head of Research Samiullah Tariq remarked that the market rallies as economic conditions remain stable, the successful Eurobond payment and steady forex reserves, good financial results, and optimism regarding the new IMF agreement.
As a result, the benchmark KSE 100 index closed at 70,909.90 points after rallying 619.79 points, or 0.88pc from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume inched up 8.06pc to 475.83 million shares. However, the traded value fell 4.68pc to Rs23.22bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pak Refinery Ltd (49.66m shares), Cnergyico PK Ltd	(26.77m shares), Kohinoor Spinning	Mills Ltd (22.83m shares), The Bank of Punjab (21.40m shares) and Air Link Communication (20.68m shares).
The companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs200.00), Hoechst Pak (Rs97.49), Hallmark Company (Rs56.00), Nestle Pakistan Rs52.50) and Philip Morris (Rs45.00).
The shares registering the most significant decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs30.10), Service Industries Ltd (Rs9.50), Archroma Pakistan Ltd (Rs9.45), Sitara Chemical Industries (Rs6.00)and Al-Noor Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs5.48).
Foreign investors continued their buying spree by purchasing shares worth $5.69m.

3,Govt borrows record Rs5.5tr from banks,Financial experts believe new agreement with the IMF may open a window for Pakistan to borrow from the international market.,"KARACHI: Within a week, the government borrowed over Rs650 billion from banks to meet its rising expenditure, reflecting the consequence of high inflation.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data showed that the government’s borrowing from commercial banks reached a record Rs5.5 trillion from July 1 to April 5, 2023-24. This is against Rs2.95bn in the same period last fiscal year.
Only last week as reported by the SBP on April 13, the government’s borrowings from the commercial banks were Rs4.842tr. It shows during a week the government borrowed Rs657bn to reach Rs5.5tr.
 
 

This massive borrowing is overburdening the economy, with the domestic debts not leaving space for revenue allocation other than interest payments. The government will have to pay more than half of the total budgetary outlay in interest payments.
During FY23, the government borrowed Rs3.7tr from banks, but the current situation looks alarming as the government has exceeded last year’s level by Rs1.784tr in the first nine months.
The government usually borrows heavily from banks in the last quarter of a fiscal year to paint a better picture of the economic performance.
The economy is in serious trouble on both internal and external fronts. The maximum revenue generated is used to pay back the domestic debt and interest. This considerable outflow does not leave space for any government for new development programmes; instead, most of the development funds are slashed for other sectors.
The situation is even worse on the external front, where borrowing is difficult as Pakistan’s repayment capacity has been reduced to the lowest level. Pakistan needs IMF help to restore its image for foreign investors, but for the last two years, the government has been unable to borrow from international markets.
Financial experts believe that the new agreement with the IMF may open a window for Pakistan to borrow from the international market. However, they believe time is required to sustain growth and remove major reasons for uncertainties.
Analysts estimate that the current borrowing from banks could touch Rs7tr by the end of June 2024. The government has been increasing energy prices but has not generated enough revenue to meet its expenditures.

4,Customs broadens oversight to curb mis-invoicing,"To enhance transparency in valuation, the customs department will transition from the current Valuation Rulings (VRs) to Publication Valuation Rulings (PVRs).","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s customs department plans to broaden its oversight of commodities, encompassing imports valued up to Rs3.030 trillion by September to curb mis-invoicing and under-invoicing practices, said a senior customs official.
To enhance transparency in valuation, the customs department will transition from the current Valuation Rulings (VRs) to Publication Valuation Rulings (PVRs). These PVRs are grounded in international research data, which will also limit the discretionary power of customs officials.
Director, Directorate General of Customs Valuation, Karachi Fayaz Rasool Maken told Dawn that the import values of PVRs are projected to increase from Rs2.357tr in 2022-23 to Rs3.030tr by the end of 2023-24. He emphasised that this trend underscores the customs department’s intention to transition from VRs to PVRs, which he described as a more reliable and transparent system.
Mr Maken stated that implementing PVRs has significantly reduced the likelihood of mis-invoicing and under-invoicing in Pakistan’s imports, valued at Rs5.5tr. He considers this a substantial accomplishment, particularly because other imports, such as duty-free items and petroleum products, typically present a lower risk of mis-invoicing and under-invoicing.
Earlier in the day, Mr Maken conducted the orientation session on implementation of Linking International Value (LlVE) System under Innovation Framework to control mis-invoicing, which was developed and deployed in December 2022. Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) hosted the session.
Mr Maken said that the directorate of valuation has so far linked over 150 commodities involving an import value of Rs2.280tr, which cover products including HRC, CRC, GP, food items, Paper, Yarn, Crude Oil & LPG, Polymers and Chemicals, etc — with international publications — LME, Public Ledger, Asian Pulp and paper, Yarn and Fibre database, Platts, ICIS, Argus Media, Reuter and CCFEI etc.
He said that in order to fulfil this objective effectively, the customs department is exploring more robust databases, including QY Research, Statista, and Factiva, to arrive at the actual values of goods as envisioned by the WTO Valuation Agreement. QY Research is a leading global market research and consulting company that offers exhaustive information, inter alia, about commodity prices.
Mr Maken said that the transition from VRs to PVRs will not only optimise revenue realisation but also minimise trade/valuation disputes and ensure regulatory benefits through expeditious clearances and trade facilitation.
FPCCI chief Atif Ikram Sheikh delivered the welcome note and appreciated the efforts of Customs  in creating a conducive environment for trade and industry.

5,"Ogra, oil industry propose phased deregulation of fuel prices","Govt warned of supply chain issues, up to Rs27 per litre price hike in GB.","ISLAMABAD: Amid warnings about supply chain challenges and ret­ail prices increasing by up to Rs27 per litre in Gilgit-Baltistan, the major oil sector stakeholders — the regulator and the industry — have proposed gradual deregulation of petroleum prices over a period of two years to avoid the political pressure associated with pricing.
The government has also been advised to end its engagements with petroleum dealers and cartage contractors over their commissions and leave them to the oil industry to set their margins on a “competitive basis”. 
It should also strengthen the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) to ensure competitive market conditions, check cartelisation and monopolistic behaviour, and guarantee product quality, quantity, and availability to consumers.
The government has also been warned that the deregulation of inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) — the pooling mechanism for uniform rates throughout the country — was announced in 2010, which quickly “escalated into a political challenge and the policy was reversed”.

Govt warned of supply chain issues, up to Rs27 per litre price hike in GB

In what appeared to be making the process even more cumbersome, the regulator has asserted that the pricing deregulation would need a comprehensive government policy covered through a legal framework and amendments to the Petroleum Levy Surcharge Rules 1967 and Oil Rules 2016 covering refineries upliftment, demand-supply, import, export and transportation along with new provisions for checking monopoly and anti-competition practices.
To counter the retail product prices going significantly higher in northern parts of the country and other regions away from ports and refineries, Ogra has suggested the expansion of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) system for subsidising consumers of petrol, diesel and kerosene, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan and Chitral.
The “government may introduce a direct subsidy for the residents of the area through BISP in view of the expected significant variation in retail outlet prices”.
Ogra has indicated that in case the IFEM is 
abolished, the retail prices would vary by Rs6.50 to Rs8 per litre countrywide on average, although prices in Azad Kashmir and areas near ports and refineries would be lower by Rs2 to 5 per litre.
Under the main proposal of Ogra, the product prices “will be set by refineries and oil marketing companies (OMCs) themselves on a self-chosen frequency of daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly on a competitive basis”.
It said the pricing deregulation should be approached in three phases. 
In the first step, the ex-refinery price and OMC’s margin should be deregulated with oil supply chain management, to be followed by deregulation of dealers’ margin and then IFEM in six months each.
Ogra has also suggested that a careful assessment of the impact of deregulation should be carried out in view of the recently announced brownfield upgrade policy for refineries.
Ogra said the deregulation would mean the “OMCs would be free to import or locally procure as they deem fit”, and the existing arrangement would have to be abandoned, which required first upliftment of the local refinery product.
“To provide a level playing field to OMCs for negotiating ex-refinery price, the first upliftment priority principle of local products will have to be disbanded. The OMCs be given the choice to efficiently source their supplies locally or from the international market,” it said.
Both refineries and OMCs would follow the existing government policy for storage and 
minimum stock requirements and the oil industry, including refineries, will implement digitisation of the entire supply chain up to the retail outlets for transparency of product availability.
Ogra has also proposed the introduction of independent retail outlets (without OMCs) to foster competition in the retail sector with company-operated outlets. “Alternatively, the OMCs may be allowed to set the margins for their dealers,” it said.
The refineries have agreed to follow the existing ex-refinery price principles of import parity price except to keep the 10pc customs duty paid by PSO on petrol and high-speed diesel as part of the import parity price as opposed to 7.5pc currently allowed as deemed duty on high-speed diesel only.
