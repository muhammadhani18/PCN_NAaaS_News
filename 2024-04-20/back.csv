1,"Iraq's PMF force says base was attacked, army investigates",Iraqi military said a technical committee was looking into the cause of an explosion,"A huge blast at a military base in Iraq early on Saturday killed a member of an Iraqi security force that includes Iran-backed groups. The force commander said it was an attack while the army said it was investigating and there were no warplanes in the sky at the time.
Two security sources had said earlier that an airstrike caused the blast, which killed a member of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and wounded eight others at Kalso military base about 50 km (30 miles) south of Baghdad.
In a statement, the PMF said its chief of staff Abdul Aziz al-Mohammedawi had visited the location and ""reviewed the details of the investigative committees present in the place that was attacked"".
The Iraqi military said a technical committee was looking into the cause of an explosion and fire at the base, which it said happened at 1 am on Saturday.
""The air defence command report confirmed, through technical efforts and radar detection, that there was no drone or fighter jet in the air space of Babil before and during the explosion,"" the military said in a statement.
The incident in Iraq's Babil province occurred with tensions running even higher than usual across the Middle East, following what sources said was an Israeli attack in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Friday. Tehran has played it down and indicated it had no plans for retaliation.
That incident came six days after Iran fired a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel in response to a presumed Israeli airstrike that destroyed part of Iran's embassy in Damascus, killing seven Iranian Revolutionary Guards officers on April 1.
The PMF includes Iran-backed groups which, operating under the banner of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, have attacked US troops in the region and targeted Israel since the eruption of the Gaza war, declaring support for the Palestinians.
Their attacks on US forces in Syria and Iraq stopped in early February after a drone strike killed three US soldiers in Jordan, prompting heavy US airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.
But they claimed responsibility for an attack on the Israeli city of Eilat on April 1.
The US military's Central Command, in a post on X early on Saturday, denied what it said were reports that the United States had carried out airstrikes in Iraq. ""The United States has not conducted air strikes in Iraq today,"" it said.
The PMF started out as a grouping of armed factions, many close to Iran, that was later recognized as a formal security force by Iraqi authorities.

2,"Iran's foreign minister downplays drone attack, says Tehran investigating","Israel launching airstrikes on Gaza, casualties of children reported","Iran's foreign minister on Friday said Tehran was investigating an overnight attack on Iran, adding that so far a link to Israel had not been proven as he downplayed the strike.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told NBC News the drones took off from inside Iran and flew for a few hundred meters before being downed.
""They are more like toys that our children play with, not drones,"" Amirabdollahian said.
""It has not been proved to us that there is a connection between these and Israel,"" he said, adding that Iran was investigating the matter but that media reports were not accurate, according to Tehran's information.
Iranian media and officials described a small number of explosions, which they said resulted from air defenses hitting three drones over Isfahan in central Iran in the early hours of Friday. They referred to the incident as an attack by ""infiltrators"", rather than by Israel, obviating the need for retaliation.
Amirabdollahian warned that if Israel retaliated and acted against the interests of Iran, Tehran's next response would be immediate and at the maximum level.
""But if not, then we are done. We are concluded,"" he said.
The attack appeared to target an Iranian Air Force base near the city of Isfahan, deep inside the country, but without striking any strategic sites or causing major damage.
Israel has said nothing about the incident. US Secretary of State Atony Blinken said the United States had not been involved in any offensive operations, while the White House said it had no comment.
Calibrated Retaliation
Israel had said it would retaliate after a strike on April 13, the first-ever direct attack on Israel by Iran, which caused no deaths after Israel and its allies shot down hundreds of missiles and drones.
Tehran launched those attacks in response to a presumed Israeli airstrike on April 1 that destroyed a building in Iran's embassy compound in Damascus and killed several Iranian officers including a top general.
Allies including the US had pressed all week to ensure any further retaliation would be calibrated not to provoke more escalation, and Western countries tightened sanctions on Iran to mollify Israel.
There was no word from Israel on Friday as to whether further action might be planned. Apart from direct strikes on Iranian territory, it has other ways of attacking, including cycyber-attacksnd strikes on Iranian proxies elsewhere.
Violence between Israel and Iranian proxies across the Middle East has intensified throughout six months of bloodshed in Gaza, raising fears the longstanding foes' shadow war could spiral into a direct conflict.
Israel's assault on Gaza began after Hamas Islamists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's military offensive has killed 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Gazan health ministry.
As night fell on Friday, Israeli planes and tanks pounded several areas across the Gaza Strip, with air strikes hitting areas of Rafah where over half of Gaza's 2.3 million people are sheltering, according to residents, Hamas media, and officials at the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.
One strike hit two apartments in a residential building in the city, killing nine people, including four children, and wounding several others, health officials said.
Air strikes also destroyed at least five houses in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, residents and Hamas media said.
""They (Israeli security) phoned some residents and ordered them to evacuate their houses before planes bombed some buildings nearby,"" Abu Omar, a resident of Al-Nuseirat, told Reuters via a chat app.
""Soon as we ran away explosions shook the ground,"" he added.
Israel's government did not immediately reply to a request for comment

3,Top Afghan Taliban aide shot dead in Pakistan,Akhundzada was visiting Pakistan over Eid holidays when he was attacked,"A close aide of Taliban supreme leader Mullah Habitullah Akhundzada and former bodyguard of another leader, Mullah Mansoor, was assassinated in Pakistan by unknown assailants near the Pak-Afghan border on Saturday.
The deceased, identified as Mohammad Omar Jan Akhundzada, was leading evening prayers at a mosque in the city of Quetta on Thursday when he was attacked. 
There are no immediate claims of responsibility for the deadly shooting.
Akhundzada hailed from Zabul province and held the position of chief at a seminary in Kandahar.
Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid, on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), urged local authorities to take decisive action against those responsible for the assassination.
The deceased was reportedly on Eid holidays and was visiting family in the area .
The loss of a senior member has sent a shockwaves within the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as the killed leader was reportedly targeted by the militant Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) in Pakistan.

Following the withdrawal of United States-led foreign forces in August 2021, numerous central religious figures and associates of the Taliban have been targeted for assassination within Afghanistan, including in the capital, Kabul.
The ISKP, a regional affiliate of the Islamic State and a fierce rival of the Taliban, has claimed responsibility for a significant number of these attacks.

4,Interior minister discusses President Raisi’s visit with Iranian envoy,"Pakistan values its brotherly relations with Iran, says Naqvi","Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met with Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam and discussed the upcoming visit of President Ebrahim Raisi, scheduled for April 22.
The visit amid escalating tension following the Tehran-cross border strike and Iran’s retaliatory strike on Israel territory will serve as a test case right when the US and its allies are looking to corner Tehran. However, the visit is a milestone in the development of cross-border connections.
Talking to the Iranian envoy in Islamabad, Naqvi said Pakistan values its brotherly relations with Iran and assured that the two countries will work together to resolve common challenges. 
Read Raisi likely to visit Pakistan this month
Naqvi and Moghadam also held discussions regarding agreements to be signed during high-level visit of the Iranian president.
The interior minister noted that the visit of the head of state is very important in the context of the regional situation and added that the visit will be a milestone in the promotion of bilateral relations.
The expected discussions during the visit of the Iranian president would centre around border security, the long-delayed Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline, trade, economic cooperation, and mutual areas of interest. The meetings will also address the broader regional situation and the Iran-Israel conflict.
The visit signifies sustainable efforts by both countries to foster deep relationships, following a temporary setback earlier this year.

5,US House advances $95 billion Ukraine-Israel package toward Saturday vote,"The legislation transfers frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, impose sanctions on Hamas, Iran, and ByteDance.","The US House of Representatives advanced a $95 billion legislative package on Friday providing aid to Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific in a broad bipartisan vote, overcoming hardline Republican opposition that had held it up for months.
Friday's procedural vote, which passed 316-94 with more support from Democrats than the Republicans who hold a narrow majority, advanced a package similar to a measure that passed the Democratic-majority Senate in February.
Democratic President Joe Biden, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell, and top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries had been pushing for a House vote since then Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had held off in the face of opposition from a small but vocal segment of his party.
In addition to the aid for allies, the package includes a provision to transfer frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, sanctions targeting Hamas and Iran, and force China's ByteDance to sell social media platform TikTok face a ban in the US.
The legislation provides more than $95 billion in security assistance, including $9.1 billion for humanitarian aid, which Democrats had demanded.
If the House passes the measure, as expected, the Senate will need to follow suit to send it to Biden to sign into law.
Schumer on Friday told senators to be prepared to come back over the weekend if needed.
Some conservative lawmakers oppose aid to Ukraine, and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has sent mixed messages about it.
Some Democrats also oppose certain provisions in the bill, notably on Israel aid, and have pushed for more conditions on that assistance.

6,Man sets self on fire outside New York court where Trump trial underway,"Officials said victim, late 30s, survived and is in critical condition at hospital","A man set himself on fire on Friday outside the New York courthouse where Donald Trump's historic hush-money trial was taking place as jury selection wrapped up, but officials said he did not appear to have been targeting Trump.
The man burned for several minutes in full view of television cameras that were set up outside the courthouse, where the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president is being held.
""He was on fire for quite a while,"" one witness, who declined to give his name, told reporters. ""It was pretty horrifying.""
Officials said the man, who is in his late 30s, survived and was in critical condition at a hospital.
Witnesses said the man pulled pamphlets out of a backpack and threw them in the air before he doused himself with a liquid and set himself on fire. One of those pamphlets included references to ""evil billionaires"" but portions that were visible to a Reuters witness did not mention Trump.
The New York Police Department said the man, who they identified as Max Azzarello of St. Augustine, Florida, did not appear to be targeting Trump or others involved in the trial.
""Right now we are labelling him as sort of a conspiracy theorist, and we are going from there,"" Tarik Sheppard, a deputy commissioner with the Police Department, said at a news conference.
In an online manifesto, a man using that name said he set himself on fire and apologized to friends, witnesses and first responders. The post warns of ""an apocalyptic fascist coup"" and criticizes cryptocurrency and US politicians, but does not single out Trump in particular.
A smell of smoke lingered in the plaza shortly after the incident, according to a Reuters witness, and a police officer sprayed a fire extinguisher on the ground. A smouldering backpack and a gas can were visible.
The downtown Manhattan courthouse, heavily guarded by police, drew a throng of protesters and onlookers on Monday, the trial's first day, though crowds have dwindled since then.
Jury selection completed
The shocking development came shortly after jury selection for the trial was completed, clearing the way for prosecutors and defence attorneys to make opening statements on Monday in a case stemming from hush money paid to a porn star. The court adjourned later in the afternoon.
The 12 jurors, along with six alternates, will consider evidence in a first-ever trial to determine whether a former US president is guilty of breaking the law. Prosecutors intend to call at least 20 witnesses, according to Trump defense lawyer Susan Necheles. Trump may testify on his behalf, in a risky move that would open him up to cross-examination.
The jury consists of seven men and five women, mostly employed in white-collar professions: two corporate lawyers, a software engineer, a speech therapist and an English teacher. Most are not native New Yorkers, hailing from across the US and countries like Ireland and Lebanon. The alternates, who will also hear the case, are held in reserve in case one of the jurors has to leave due to illness or some other cause.
Trump is accused of covering up a $130,000 payment his then-lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she says they had a decade earlier.
Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and denies any such encounter with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.
Trump has pleaded not guilty in three other criminal cases as well, but this is the only one certain to go to trial ahead of the Novemebr 5 election when the Republican politician aims to again take on Democratic President Joe Biden.
A conviction would not bar him from office.

7,IHC seeks suggestions from judges,CJ asks jurists about convening full SC court on letter alleging ‘interference’ in judicial affairs,"High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq on Friday sought suggestions from all other high court judges about convening a full court over a letter written by six IHC jurists to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) alleging that the country’s intelligence agencies were “interfering” in judicial matters.
In line with the Supreme Court’s directions, the IHC chief justice sought suggestions from the judges by April 22 (Monday).
Sources said suggestions had also been sought from the Islamabad East and West district and sessions judges.
They added that a copy of the apex court's order had also been sent to the judges.
After receiving the judges' suggestions, it will be decided whether or not a full court should be convened on the matter.
Last month, six IHC judges -- Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kiyani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz -- penned a letter to the SJC led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, expressing concerns about the ""interference"" of intelligence agencies in the affairs of the courts.
""We, therefore, request that a judicial convention be called to consider the matter of interference of intelligence operatives with judicial functions and/or intimidation of judges in a manner that undermines the independence of the judiciary.”
The open letter, a copy which had been sent to all SC judges, noted that such a convention might provide further information as to whether or not jurists of other high courts have had similar experiences.
“Such institutional consultation might then assist the Supreme Court to consider how best to protect independence of the judiciary, put in place a mechanism to affix liability for those who undermine such independence and clarify for the benefit of individual judges the course of action they must take when they find themselves at the receiving end of interference and/or intimidation by members of the executive.”
The move came just days after the ruling by the apex court, which deemed the removal of former IHC Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui as illegal, decreeing his status as that of a retired judge.
The verdict highlighted the SJC's approach towards Justice Siddiqui's case, indicating that the council had proceeded under the assumption that the veracity of the allegations raised by the former judge was irrelevant.

8,High courts chalk steps to safeguard independence,LHC full court meeting to deliberate on SC’s April 3 order,"In a bid to safeguard independence of the judiciary from undue interference, various high courts across the country have initiated deliberations aimed at formulating proposals to address concerns regarding meddling in the judicial functions by agencies.
Lahore High Court (LHC) Chief Justice Malik Shehzad Ahmed Khan has called for a full court meeting scheduled for Monday to deliberate on the Supreme Court's April 3 order in a suo motu case on a letter from six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges.
The LHC judges will discuss and ""consider how best to protect the independence of the judiciary"" and to ""put in place a mechanism to affix liability for those who undermine such independence and clarity for the benefit of individual judges the course they must take when they find themselves at the receiving end of interference and/or intimidation by members of the executive"", in the light of directions of the SC passed in sou motu case.
All the judges gracing at principal seat have been requested to make it convenient to attend the meeting. The judges working at the three benches as per respective rosters will participate in the meeting through video-link.
It has been revealed that IHC CJ Aamer Farooq has requested proposals from all high court judges individually by Monday.
Following the submission of these proposals, a decision will be made regarding the convening of a full court meeting.
Similarly, two judges from Islamabad sessions courts have been tasked with providing proposals on the same subject. Copies of the order have been distributed to the relevant judges for their consideration.
Furthermore, Sindh High Court Chief Justice Aqeel Abbasi may also call for a full court meeting on this matter in the near future.
In pursuant to the April 3 order, all high courts and other relevant stakeholders are supposed to submit their proposals by April 25.
Lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii stated that it is a welcome step, which contributes to fostering consensus within the judiciary, as originally sought by the letter from the IHC judges. ""It will help if this is repeated in every other high court; and if judges are allowed to speak their mind on their own experiences of interference by the executive,” he added.
This, he reckoned, will also go towards establishing the extent of interference and also to create a deterrent against such pressure.
Two leading legal bodies, namely the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), have also been requested to submit their proposals. The majority of representatives in both organisations belong to the Independent Group, which is known to be aligned with the government.
One representative of the bar stated that, in principle, the bar opposes interference by agencies in judicial functions. However, he believes that a commission comprising serving judges is necessary to identify individuals who attempted to manipulate judicial proceedings.
Nonetheless, both bars stand in solidarity with CJP Qazi Faez Isa in all matters, he asserted.
Meanwhile, former prime minister Imran Khan has decided to send a letter to Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa. In the letter, he will urge the chief justice not to preside over cases related to him and the PTI in light of the recent order from the larger bench.
Imran will also raise objections to any potential government efforts to extend CJP Isa's tenure through constitutional amendments.

The judge ordered the Pims mecial board to visit Elahi in the jail on Saturday (today) and informed the court whether he should be kept in jail or shifted to hospital.
The court also sought report about the facilities being provided to Elahi in the jail. It directed the the jail superintendent to submit a report regarding the treatment of Elahi in the jail. The hearing was adjourned till Monday.
