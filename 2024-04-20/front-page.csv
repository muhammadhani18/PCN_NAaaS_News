0,Analysis: To build or not to build — the Iran pipeline conundrum,"Between the threat of US sanctions and possible Iranian penalties, experts question whether the ‘Peace Pipeline’ will be a panacea for the country’s energy crisis.","THE rooftop of Vaqar Zakaria’s home in Islamabad is strewn with photovoltaic panels that he says have lowered his electricity bill to virtually nothing. This is countered by the stark contrast in his rising gas costs. “From a steady Rs800 a month, it has risen to Rs4,000 in the last six months,” he says.
Mr Zakaria, head of environmental consulting firm Hagler Bailley Pakistan, is fortunate to have a gas supply at home. His situation highlights a nationwide energy paradox, where advancements in one sector are negated by crises in another.
“If only Pakistan had imported Iranian gas back in the late 1990s when there were no sanctions,” Mr Zakaria told The Third Pole, recalling a time when prices were far cheaper “at just $2 per million British thermal units (mmBtu)”.
A participant in some of the early discussions, Mr Zakaria remembers strategising over the proposed 2,775km pipeline that promised to link Pakistan’s energy supply directly to Iran’s abundant gas reserves.

Between the threat of US sanctions on one side and possible Iranian penalties on the other, experts question whether the ‘Peace Pipeline’ will be a panacea for the country’s energy crisis

The long-term project, which came to be known as the ‘Peace Pipeline’, has faced significant delays due to geopolitical pressures, sanctions on Iran and financial hurdles within Pakistan.
Iran’s proven natural gas reserves, estimated at 1,203 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) as of December 2021, are second only to Russia.
Ten-year wait
In February this year, the caretaker government decided to dust off the 2009 agreement, approving the construction of the first phase or 80km stretch (of the total 780km pipeline) from the Iranian border to Gwadar.
Meanwhile, Tehran has issued a deadline: finish the pipeline segment by March 2024 or incur financial repercussions amounting to nearly $18bn — a sum that could prompt international arbitration.
“We are very reluctant to take this drastic step,” Hassan Nourain, the consul general of Iran in Karachi, told The Third Pole, adding, “but the gas company of Iran is a national company and belongs to the people of Iran. It invested $1bn years ago. Now, the Iranian parliament is pressuring the government to decide the fate of this project”.
Iran had already fulfilled its part of the agreement by completing 1,100km of pipeline from the South Pars gas fields to the Pakistan border. Then in 2014, it extended the deadline by an additional decade, on Pakistan’s request, he added.
But Islamabad is also feeling the pressure from the US. Last month, Donald Lu, the US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia cautioned Pakistan against importing gas from Iran, as it would expose it to US sanctions.
In response, Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch made a case for national sovereignty; since the pipeline is being built within Pakistani territory, “we do not believe that at this point there is room for any discussion or waiver from a third party”, she said.
Nonetheless, Thomas Mont­gomery — the acting US mission spokesperson in Pakistan — offered the following words of caution: “We advise anyone considering business deals with Iran to be aware of the potential risk of sanctions.”
The US has been pushing Pakistan to seek green alternatives; through its development agency it has helped add almost 4,000 MW of clean energy to Pakistan’s grid since 2010.
Speaking in a personal capacity, Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed of the ruling PML-N highlighted the tension between national sovereignty and the US: “We invite its meddling by abdicating our own autonomy for decisions on our core interests.”
Despite the warnings from its longstanding ally, Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif told The Third Pole that the energy infrastructure project would proceed, signalling Pakistan’s intention to assert its autonomy: “We will go ahead with construction of the pipeline,” he said.
Waiver favour
While Pakistan grapples with Iran’s deadline, the land in Gwadar earmarked for construction has yet to be acquired, according to government insiders.
Micheal Kugelman, director of the Wilson Centre’s South Asia Institute in Washington, summarises the predicament: “Pakistan is seemingly caught between the devil and the deep blue sea — build the pipeline and risk being sanctioned, or don’t build it and get slapped with a massive fine.”
Ahmad Irfan Aslam, the former law minister in the caretaker government that greenlighted construction of the 80km section of the pipeline, points out Pakistan’s reliance on the US for “everything from economic bailouts to its security”. He warned any waiver request would necessitate complex negotiations.
“We cannot bear American sanctions. We will present our stance to the US,” Petroleum Minister Musadik Malik told journalists last month. “Iran has been told multiple times that we need their gas.
We want to complete this project but without any sanctions,“ he had said.
Mr Montgomery confirmed Pakistan has yet to present a formal waiver request. With Pakistan in a tight spot, Mr Aslam suggested exploring a deadline extension and seeking a waiver, which “would require support from both Saudi Arabia and the UAE.”
But as tensions mount in the Middle East over the war in Gaza, with new US sanctions against Iran announced on April 18, Mr Kugelman said it was unlikely that the US would grant Pakistan a sanctions waiver to proceed with the project.
Economic feasibility
Pakistan has around 19.5 Tcf of proven gas reserves, sufficient for just 12 more years, based on current annual consumption levels.
“The only advantage to have Iranian gas is if there is a guarantee of firm supply at favourable rates,” said Haneea Isaad, an energy finance specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
Although Khawaja Asif said the government was “looking towards raising funds from international banks”, Mr Zakaria warned that securing investment may prove challenging.
“Neither the development finance institutions nor western and Middle Eastern banks will lend for the project in view of US sanctions placed on Iran, which will also make it difficult for Pakistan to pay for the gas received from Iran,” he said.
Pakistan’s best bet may be to build the pipeline with financing from China or some other external source, notes Mr Kugelman.
Among possible funders is Russia. Senator Mushahid Hussain told The Third Pole that, “Russia has offered to fund the initial $160m for the 80km of Pakistan-Iran pipeline.”
Iran, said its consul general, “would be happy to provide technical and engineering support in building the pipeline”.
But Pakistan faces a complex energy transition, marked by growing demand and discussions centred on the immediate challenges of costs, legal action and geopolitical dynamics.
As Islamabad prepares to host Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on an official three-day visit from April 22, Isaad warns against viewing Iranian gas as a panacea for Pakistan’s energy needs, emphasising it is “another imported
commodity and subject to geopolitical considerations and linked to global oil prices“.

1,ME breathes easy as Iran brushes off ‘Israeli strike’,"• Tel Aviv, Washington stay tight-lipped over ‘attack’; US media claims Biden admin had advance information • Tehran hardly","• Tel Aviv, Washington stay tight-lipped over ‘attack’; US media claims Biden admin had advance information
• Tehran hardly acknowledges incident; officials claim ‘a few drones’ shot down over Isfahan
• Fears of wider conflict subside after initial reports spur flight cancellations, market fluctuations
TEHRAN / JERU­SALEM / DUBAI: Reports of overnight explosions in Isfahan that were termed an Israeli strike on Iran caused an initial flurry of activity on Friday, with the markets reacting sharply, airlines cancelling flights in the region and world leaders going into crisis-control mode. 
But the limited scale of the so-called attack and the muted response from both Tehran and Tel Aviv — who have not shied away from ramping up the rhetoric in the past — indicated that there was no will on either side to further escalate the situation. 
The apparent attack was the latest in a round of actions, set off by the killing of seven Iranian officers in an Israeli strike on an embassy compound in Damascus. Iran retaliated over the weekend with hundreds of drones and missiles, some of which are said to have reached targets inside Israel.
On Friday morning, US outlet ABC News reported Israeli strikes on Iran, while the Fars news agency said an explosion was heard at an airport in Isfahan, but the cause was not immediately known.
Several Iranian nuclear sites are located in Isfahan province, including Natanz, centerpiece of Iran’s uranium enrichment programme. But CNN quoted a US official as stating the target was not a nuclear facility, and the Inter­nati­onal Ato­mic Energy Age­ncy also reported no damage to Iranian nuclear sites.
Israeli media also cited reports from the New York Times and the Washington Post, which quoted unnamed Israeli officials as confirming Israel was behind the attack, but did not report official confirmation of their own.
Israel has a long tradition of maintaining ambiguity over issues like nuclear weapons and intelligence operations and the silence appeared to be part of its messaging. 
The Israeli military and foreign ministries declined comment and there were no immediate public statements from senior politicians apart from hardline security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, who sent out the one word message “Feeble!” on social media platform X. In departure for a White House that routinely weighs in on the latest developments in the Middle East, spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said on Friday they had no comment on reports of Israeli attacks in Iran overnight.
But according to officials quoted by NBC and CNN, the US received advance notice of Israel’s reported strike on Iran, but did not endorse the operation or play any part in its execution. 
Iran’s muted reponse
Iranian media appeared to play down the significance of the strike. In official statements, there was almost no mention that Israel – or the ‘Zionist entity’ as it is usually called – was behind it. State television carried analysts and other pundits who all appeared be dismissive about the scale.
“There has been a remarkable fabrication to exaggerate the extent of the incident,” the semi-official ISNA news agency said, with one analyst telling state TV that “mini drones shot down by air defences in Isfahan were flown by infiltrators from inside Iran”.
A senior Iranian official told Reuters there were no plans to respond against Israel for the incident.
“The foreign source of the incident has not been confirmed. We have not received any external attack, and the discussion leans more towards infiltration than attack,” the official said.
Even Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi made no mention of the explosions, nor did he cut short his trip to the central province of Semnan, indicating that the country was not on high alert. 
In comments made to the envoys of Muslim countries in New York, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said the drones caused no damage or casualties in Isfahan.
Iran’s army commander-in-chief Abdolrahim Mousavi attributed Friday’s explosions to “the firing of anti-aircraft defence systems on a suspicious object”. He said there was “no damage” and that investigations were underway to assess the scale of the incident, according to Tasnim news agency.
Iran’s space agency spokesman Hossein Dalirian, referring to a type of drone, said there was “a failed and humiliating attempt to fly quad-copters, which were shot down.” In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he denied Iran had been attacked from abroad.
Flurry of activity
Confirmed or not, reports of the suspected Israeli strike on Iran sent markets, airlines and world leaders into a frenzy on Friday morning. 
Prices of oil, gold and equities seesawed during the trading session, crude oil prices surged as much as four percent on worries about supplies from the oil-rich region before turning lower as it became apparent the strike was limited and neither side appeared eager to escalate. 
The initial rush for safety also saw the yen rally against the dollar and gold jump back past $2,400 per ounce, while the Swiss franc and US government bonds won support. They all later gave up much of those gains.
Asian equities bore the brunt of the shock of the news of the attack. European equities recovered to end the day mixed, with Wall Street stocks also mixed in late morning trading.
Meanwhile, most major global airlines cancelled flights into Israel and other destinations in the Middle East, but by the end of the day, most Gulf-based carriers — such as Qatar Airways, flydubai, Emirates, Etihad — had resumed their operations. 
Calls for calm
Following the early morning reports of an Israeli strike, the international community sprung into action with a chorus of voices unanimous in their calls for de-escalation. 
UN chief Antonio Guterres said it was “high time to stop the dangerous cycle of retaliation in the Middle East”, while European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen stressed the need for stability in the region.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called for calm heads to prevail across the region, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that de-escalation remained the order of the day.
Following a meeting in Capri, G7 foreign ministers also issued a statement, saying: “We urge all parties to work to prevent further escalation. The G7 will continue to work to this end.”

2,"Guard killed, all five Japanese safe in Karachi suicide attack",• Two passers-by injured; another assailant killed by police; one of the attackers said to be linked with BRA • 10 grenades reco,"• Two passers-by injured; another assailant killed by police; one of the attackers said to be linked with BRA
• 10 grenades recovered from two suspects
• President, PM laud timely police response  
KARACHI: A private security guard was killed in a suicide attack targeting Japanese nationals near Mansehra Colony in the city’s Landhi neighbourhood on Friday morning, officials said.
The five Japanese, travelling in a van to their workplace, escaped unhurt. Two passers-by were injured, one of them in critical condition. According to witnesses, the attack involved a suicide bomber and a second assailant who was shot dead by police.
No individual or group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
However, Raja Umer Khattab, a senior official at the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), claimed that one of the deceased attackers was a member of an outlawed Baloch separatist group from Panjgur.
DIG East Azfar Mahesar told Dawn the Japanese nationals were travelling from their residence in Clifton to the export zone when the attackers struck near Murtaza Chowrangi.
“All five Japanese remained safe. However, a private security guard accompanying them and two passers-by were injured,” Mr Mahesar, a retired army captain, said.
He said the guards and police responded swiftly, with a Sharafi Goth police patrolling unit managing to secure the Japanese and escort them to safety.
Investigators seized a submachine gun, a bag full of grenades and a motorcycle at the scene.
A police official, who asked not to be named, claimed that it was a “failed operation” by the militants. He claimed they had mistakenly targeted the Japanese nationals, assuming them as Chinese because of facial resemblances.
DIG Asif Aijaz Shaikh of the CTD told Dawn the van was armoured, which helped prevent casualties among the foreigners. He disclosed that the attackers used a motorcycle to carry out the bombing, adding that the rapid response of the patrolling police averted a greater tragedy.
Mr Khattab said the foreigners were travelling in three vehicles, including a Revo and a Fortuner, apart from the van that was targeted. The company’s senior officials and their guards were travelling in the other two vehicles.
He explained the attack began when the van slowed at a speed breaker, prompting the suicide bomber to detonate the explosives prematurely. Although the blast didn’t harm the Japanese nationals, an accomplice fired at least 15 shots from behind roadblocks, while the foreigners’ guards returned fire. Nearby police responded, and as the shooter focused on the guards, a police officer fatally shot him in the head.
Mr Khattab stated that much impact of the blast was absorbed by a passing van carrying bakery goods. Glasses on only one side of the foreigners’ van were broken.
The deceased guard was identified as Noor Mohammed, 45, who succumbed to injuries at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), where two other injured passers-by were also being treated.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said one unidentified male body of the alleged suicide bomber was brought in fragments at the JPMC. Dr Syed said there were five pieces of the body of the suspected suicide bomber, but he was identifiable. Therefore, DNA samples were taken.
Another unidentified body of the attacker was also brought, who had received four bullet injuries. His DNA samples were also taken for identification. Both suspects were in their 30s.
Abid Farooq, an official of the Bomb Disposal Squad, told Dawn that a total of six hand grenades and four rifle grenades were recovered from the custody of both suspects.
BRA affiliation
Mr Khattab of CTD claimed that one of the suspects killed, identified as Sohail Ahmed from Panjgur district, was affiliated with the outlawed Baloch Republican Army (BRA).
The official claimed that Ahmed, who had been “missing” since 2022, was previously involved in the Baloch insurgency from 2008 to 13, later joined the Levies Force, and was dismissed in September 2023 after disappearing. Ahmed had reportedly joined the Majeed Brigade, a faction of the BRA, in 2021.
President, PM condemn attack
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the suicide attack and lauded police’s timely res­ponse by the to avert casualties.
In separate statements, both the president and prime minister said the timely action by the police averted a huge life loss and reiterated their firm resolve to wipe out terrorism from the country.

3,PHC orders KP CM to convene assembly session for oath-taking,"Twenty MPAs had requested court to declare illegal the failure of speaker, deputy speaker to call the assembly’s sitting for administering oath.","PESHAWAR: The Pesh­awar High Court (PHC) has directed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister and cabinet to convene the assembly session within a fortnight to ensure that those elected on reserved seats for women and non-Muslims take oath.
A PHC bench comprising Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Shakeel Ahmad, in its 24-page detailed judgement on three identical petitions filed by around 20 MPAs-elect of the opposition in KP, also ordered the provincial assembly speaker to administer the oath to the said MPAs-elect in the session to be requisitioned in accordance with the court order.
While the bench in its March 27 short order had not issued any such directive to the CM and the provincial cabinet, the court in its detailed judgement ord­ered both to “take all material steps in terms of Arti­cle 109 along with all enabling provisions of the Cons­titution for summoning the session of the provincial assembly within fortnight positively, after receipt of this judgement, so that the oath is administered to the petitioners in term of Article 65 of the Constitution before the upcoming Senate election”.
The PHC in its short order had directed the speaker to administer the oath to the petitioners in the session convened for Senate election of April 2 and also to facilitate voting in the election. But the ECP had to postpone the Senate polls in the province making it conditional with the said oath-taking, as no session was convened by the KP government.
Now multiple petitions have been filed in the high court — one by the speaker requesting the court to review its order and others by the MPAs-elect seeking implementation of the short order and initiating contempt proceedings against the speaker and the deputy speaker.
The PHC in its judgement observed that owing to a dispute over allocation of reserved seats, with the exception of Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) that has a majority in KP Assembly, the present dispensation was resisting oath to those who represent marginalised communities in order to deny them the right to participate in the assembly proceedings and also to deprive them of exercising their right to vote in the April 2 Senate election in violation of the Constitution.
Referring to the notifications issued by the ECP of declaring the petitioners as MPAs elected on reserved seats, the court ruled that after receipt of the said notification, the assembly secretary was obliged under the law to have informed the CM to requisition the assembly session to administer oath to the petitioners accordingly, but he failed to discharge his constitutional obligations for reasons best known to him.
The petitioners, including Shazia Tehmas Khan and 19 other MPAs belonging to the PPP-P, PML-N, JUI-F and PTI-P, had requested the court to declare illegal and unconstitutional the failure of both speaker and deputy speaker to call the assembly’s sitting for administering oath.

4,Speaker suspends two PTI MNAs over ‘rowdyism’,"Dasti, Iqbal barred from current session; action taken for misconduct during president’s address; NA witnesses two walko","ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Friday suspended the membership of two Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers for the current session for “eroding the sanctity” of the assembly by “indulging in rowdy behaviour” during President Asif Zardari’s address to the joint sitting of parliament on April 18.
The speaker read out his ruling regarding the suspension of MNAs Jamshaid Dasti from Muzaffargarh and Muhammad Iqbal Khan from Khyber after seeking approval of the house on a motion through a voice vote minutes before the culmination of an eventful sitting, marred by separate protests by members of the opposition PTI, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on different issues.
The house also witnessed two token walkouts and as many failed attempts to disrupt the proceedings by pointing out the lack of quorum.
The PTI and PPP members staged token walkouts as a mark of protest when the speaker did not give them the floor to respond to each other on the issue of the president’s address, whereas the JUI-F lawmakers protested against the speaker’s act of administering the oath to Sadaf Ihsan, who had been declared the winner by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on a reserved seat for women from KP on the JUI-F ticket.

Dasti, Iqbal barred from current session; action taken for misconduct during president’s address; NA witnesses two walkouts as opposition members continue noisy protest

Speaking on a point of order soon after the oath, JUI-F’s Noor Alam Khan termed the speaker’s act “illegal and unconstitutional”, stating that a case was pending before a court of law and party chief Maulana Fazlur Rahman had already informed the ECP that Ms Ihsan had not been issued the ticket.
As a mark of protest, he pointed out the lack of quorum, but the speaker declared the house in order after a headcount.
MNAs’ suspension
Before reading out his ruling, the speaker stated that he had been forced to take action against the two MNAs when they crossed “all the limits” and that he was doing so with a “painful heart.”
Mr Sadiq announced that the two MNAs “be suspended from the services of the assembly for remainder of the session” and asked them “to forthwith withdraw the precincts of the assembly”.
“I had been showing patience, but today I will not do it,” said the speaker when the PTI members lodged noisy protest when he didn’t give floor to PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan. However, later, he gave the floor to Mr Khan, who said that his party did not consider Mr Zardari a legitimate president.
Walkouts
PPP members, led by party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, staged a walkout when Mr Khan lashed out at Mr Zardari for keeping the office of the party’s president, declaring that he did not represent the federation.
MNA Sharmila Farooqui was given the floor by the speaker to respond to the PTI chairman, but as soon as she took the floor, Mr Bhutto-Zardari with his sister Aseefa, started walking out of the assembly. At this point, PPP’s Shazia Marri pointed out lack of quorum to compel the speaker to adjourn the sitting.
Playing intelligently, the PTI members, who had already been protesting against the speaker for not giving them the floor, also staged a walkout to compel the speaker to adjourn the sitting without giving his ruling to suspend the two party MNAs.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar then went to the PPP members and succeeded in bringing them back to the house. Seeing the PPP members returning, the PTI members also came back and started raising slogans. The speaker declared the house in order and subsequently gave his ruling.
There was a rumpus in the house due to noisy protest by the PTI members when Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, on a point of order, started lambasting the opposition benches and targeted former prime minister Imran Khan.
Criticising the PTI members for “hooliganism” during the joint sitting and in the presence of diplomats, the minister said Imran Khan had been jeopardising the country’s foreign interests by issuing directives from Adiala Jail.
Security situation
Responding to a calling attention notice regarding the recent terrorist attack on a bus in Noshki, Balochistan, and Kashmore in Sindh, where an operation against the robbers was underway, Law Minister Tarar said the federal government was providing full assistance to the provincial governments to deal with the security situation.
The NA will reconvene on Monday evening.

5,Indian polls start without Modi wave,"In the first phase, polling held for 102 seats of 545-member Lok Sabha.","NEW DELHI: Elections to the 18th Lok Sabha kicked off on Friday across 21 Indian states covering 102 seats of the 545-member house, and although voters queued up in searing heat across much of the country to record an overall voting of over 60 per cent, absent from the fray was any sign of a Modi wave.
The first of the seven-phase polls saw eight seats in the politically crucial western Uttar Pradesh in the contest. The state sends 80 MPs and is regarded as a must-win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s bid for a third consecutive term.
His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had grabbed 62 of the seats in 2019, mainly riding the military standoff with Pakistan, which he exploited with posters seeking votes in the name of the army.
The 2014 elections were buoyed by the communal polarisation instigated in Muzaffarnagar with false stories of Muslims abducting Hindu girls. This time the key BJP plank of Ram temple in Ayodhya has evidently failed to enthuse the voters. Moreover, this time around the Jat community of farmers that stood with the BJP is standing in solidarity with fellow farmers in Haryana and Punjab fighting for rights promised by the Modi government but never implemented.

In the first phase, polling held for 102 seats of 545-member Lok Sabha

A discussion in Bijnor by The Wire news portal with a mix of religious and caste representatives revealed a marked absence of a Modi wave. The ‘wave’ delivered him victories in the most populous state, including his own constituency of Varanasi. Now, a Brahmin interlocutor in the discussion described himself as a hardcore supporter of the BJP who would not vote for the party this time.
His young son too will not vote for Mr Modi, citing corruption in the electoral bond scheme and the jailing of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.
The wife would not vote for Mr Modi over price hike, he said.
A triangular contest in western Uttar Pradesh involves the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) of former Dalit state chief minister Mayawati, the Samajwadi Party of the INDIA opposition cluster and the BJP. Ms Mayawati’s decision to go it on her own could damage INDIA candidates in western UP, and that rather than a Modi surge could deliver him several of the seats, though not all.
According to The Indian Express, which filed a spot report from Rajasthan by Neerja Chowdhury, “unlike the last two general elections, when the BJP swept Rajasthan, this time a contest is a possibility in nine to 10 Lok Sabha constituencies”.
An entrepreneur at Mandaava, in Jhunjhunu, told Express: “Had Modi not been there, it would have been difficult for the BJP to win. This time, there is no junoon (enthusiasm).”
A BJP leader articulated the sense on the ground, saying; “It may not change the direction of the wind, but shifts are being felt this time.”
This is how a political observer was quoted as describing it: “When you look at it closely, these fights do not reflect a fight between the BJP and the Congress nationally. It is a heavyweight candidate or a local group rivalry that seems to be overtaking the Modi factor, converting it into a takkar (contest).”
In the last two general elections — which the BJP swept, winning 25 out of 25 seats in Rajasthan — the Modi factor was able to subsume these local issues and may yet do so in many constituencies. “Modi thoda struggle mein aa gaye hain (Modi is struggling a little),” said a shopkeeper, a pro-BJP Brahmin manning a shop near the famous Khatu Shyamji Mandir in Sikar district, where, in the middle of a hot afternoon, hundreds of devotees were trying to catch a glimpse of the highly revered local deity.
Clash, bomb blast
West Bengal has elections in all seven phases, ending with the last on June 1. It recorded a turnout of 66.34pc till 3pm. However, polling was marred by violence in the Cooch Behar seat, The Hindu said. Both the TMC and the BJP clashed and lodged 80 and 39 complaints against each other respectively related to poll violence, voter intimidation, and assaults on poll agents, sources from both parties said.
In strife-torn Manipur, around 63.03pc of the over 1.544 million voters exercised their franchise till 3pm. In Chhattisgarh, more than 58pc of the electorate cast their votes in the first four hours of polling in the Naxal-hit Bastar Lok Sabha constituency where an assistant commandant of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) was killed when an improvised explosive device planted by Naxalites went off in Bijapur district.
