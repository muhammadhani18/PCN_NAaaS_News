Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ghulam Nabi Memon said this while chairing a meeting at the Central Police Office (CPO) Karachi to review security arrangements for foreign nationals.  
The officer stressed the need for strict implementation of standard operating procedures issued by the government of Sindh regarding security of foreign visitors/delegates and regular issuance of security advisories by the officers concerned.  
Supervisory officers at the range, district, and zone levels were instructed to reassess security measures for foreigners to formulate a concrete and effective police strategy and submit a review report within three days.

1,Nexus claimed between religious and secular militants,Novelist and police officer Omar Shahid sheds light on resurgence of terrorism.,"KARACHI: A senior police officer claims to have identified a nexus between jihadi and sub-nationalist secular militant groups in the country and said that they are providing each other safe havens.
DIG and novelist Omar Shahid Hamid also said young people are inclined towards militancy due to a disconnect between them and the state.
He was speaking at a talk on the rising trend of terrorism, crime and violence and solutions to curbing these, organised by Concerned Citizens Alliance (CCA) in collaboration with the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) at the PMA House on Friday.
Coming to the point right away by bringing up the latest terrorist attack on foreign nationals in the city earlier in the day, DIG Shahid said that the law enforcement agencies are facing difficult times where they are seeing a downward spiral due to the state of the country’s economics. “There is a spike in street crime, an increase in terrorist attacks,” he said, adding that the challenges faced by Pakistan regarding crime would even overwhelm Western countries.

Novelist and police officer Omar Shahid sheds light on resurgence of terrorism

He said it is not like nothing was done to control the crime but they are still unable to enjoy the peace dividend of the sacrifices that the law enforcers have made. 
“Even though Pakistan was able to break the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan [TTP], so many militants who had gone back to Afghanistan are back due to some unfortunate decisions on the part of our government. We have been seeing resurgence [of terrorism] for the past two to three years and incidents are not just shooting or firing incidents but suicide bombings, meaning the terrorists’ capacity is increasing. They have slowly revived and we have reverted to our position of 2014,” he observed.
He also mentioned militancy in Balochistan and said that it was also eating up the country’s resources. 
“We have expanded our footprint there but the problem is still not solved because the militant groups have collaborated. The jihadi groups are helping the secular groups, providing each other safe havens. There is looting and extortion as the whole system of crime feeds on it. They enable the militant groups to function comfortably as they collect amazing amounts to become some of the richest groups in the world,” he said.
“The heart of the problem is the motivation for these groups. The youth are inclined towards militancy due to a disconnect between them and the state. There is a difference between their vision and the vision that the government wants to give to its stakeholders. They are not buying that vision,” he said.
About street crime, he said renting a pistol and snatching three iPhones in a day looks far easier and feasible than holding a job, which pays far less than that in a month. “Meanwhile, desperation is increasing on both sides, that of the criminal and that of the victim. This increase leads to violence and the sensational stories that you see and hear about,” he added.
DIG Omar Shahid said that he was not saying all this as an apologist for the performance of law enforcement agencies. But he felt that the government has not invested enough in the capacity growth of the police here. 
‘Politicisation of police’
Another issue that he pointed to was “politicisation of police”. 
He explained this by pointing to the fact that internal politicisation has increased in the police. 
“And it’s not by one political party. There are also non-political actors because of whom there comes a problem with accountability. For instance, there is the inspector general of police who may not feel that he is accountable to the chief executive of his province. Then his entire chain of command may also feel the same. This becomes a problem on the operational level then. We need to reverse this, which is a tough thing to do because there is political inference and control in police in the West, too,” he said.
Earlier, CCA founder Azhar Jamil and their coordinator Mirza Ali Azhar also mentioned how the entire city is in the grips of crime.

2,Man in Karachi sentenced to life term for murdering cousin in acid attack,29-year-old Sana suffered over 25 per cent burns and later on died during treatment at Civil Hospital Karachi.,"KARACHI: A sessions court on Friday sentenced a man to life imprisonment for killing his cousin in an acid attack over rejecting his marriage proposal.
Additional District and Session Judge Shahid Ali Memon convicted Shahzad for throwing acid on 29-year-old Sana, who had suffered over 25 per cent burns and later on died during treatment in the Burns Ward of the Civil Hospital Karachi.
The judge emphasised that if the accused had wanted to marry her, he should have taken a lawful step. However, his unlawful actions resulted in the tragic loss of an innocent life.
While elucidating the impact of this offence on society, the judge remarked that the offence with which the accused had been charged was not an ordinary one; “it inflicts harm upon the entire societal fabric”, adding that these days “school-going girls, teachers and common females feel insecure due to increase of such kind of acts”.
According to state prosecutor Pervaiz Hussain Solangi, the father of the victim woman told the police that in December 2021, the accused came to his house near Akhter Colony with the intention of hurting his daughter, who had rejected his marriage proposal.
He said that the accused threw a bottle of acid on her, causing her burn injuries. Upon hearing her cries, neighbours took her to the hospital where she succumbed to her injuries.
During the trial, state prosecutor Solangi presented seven witnesses to support the case against the accused and pleaded the court to award the accused an exemplary punishment.
The defence counsel argued that the accused, being a cousin of the victim, visited the house of his maternal uncle and witnessed the deceased holding a bottle containing acid in her hand. He attempted to save her.
However, the judge rejected the defence plea and inquired as to who had brought and given her the bottle of acid if indeed the deceased possessed one.
The judge observed that the accused failed to address this query adequately. “The prosecution succeeds in establishing the case against the accused… beyond any shadow of doubt,” the judge ruled in the verdict.
A case was registered at the Mahmoodabad police station under Section 336-B (punishment for hurt by corrosive substance) read with Section 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

4,Govt officials earn SHC’s ire for failing to decide PTI plea for permission to hold public meeting,"Party applied for permission on April 3 and DC-East sought reports from officials on 15th, court told","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday came down heavily on the district administration for an inordinate delay in deciding an application of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, seeking permission to hold a public meeting near the Mazar-i-Quaid on April 28.
The deputy commissioner concerned submitted that the application was still under consideration while a provincial law officer insisted that the public gathering could not be held at the subject venue under the relevant law.
The SHC ordered the DC to decide the application and submit a report till April 26.
The PTI petitioned the SHC and submitted that the district and provincial administration were not deciding its applications to hold a public gathering on April 28.

Party applied for permission on April 3 and DC-East sought reports from officials on 15th, court told

At the last hearing, the SHC directed the authorities concerned to process the applications in accordance with law and sought a compliance report if there was no legal impediment.
At the outset of the hearing on Friday, Deputy Commissioner Shahzad Abbasi filed a report and stated that upon receipt of the PTI’s application, he forwarded letters on April 15, to SSP, resident engineer/secretary of Quaid-i-Azam Mazar Management Board and assistant commissioners of Ferozabad and Jamshed Quarters for specific comments so that permission may be accorded.
He contended that the request of the petitioner for public gathering was still under consideration and permission would be issued on receipt of reports from the officers concerned according to the law.
Responding to a question of the court, the DC submitted that he received the application on April 3.
A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi expressed serious resentment over the DC for an inordinate delay in deciding the matter and remarked that “you enjoy sitting in an air-conditioned room”, asking him if there was any ‘rocket science’ involved to take a decision on the subject matter.
Assistant Advocate General (AAG) Saifullah contended that no rally and public gathering could be held within the premises of the Quaid’s mausoleum including the ground/park in question under Section 6 of the Quaid-i-Azam Mazar (Protection and Maintenance) Ordinance, 1971.
Representing the petitioner, Advocate Ali Tahir argued that the subject ground/park was not part of the mausoleum and in the past various political parties had held several public gatherings at the same venue.
The chief justice warned that it may make the contention of AAG part of the record so nobody could hold such gathering in future.
The bench directed the DC to complete the relevant procedure, decide the matter and submit report till April 26.
Citing the chief secretary, commissioner of Karachi and DC (East) as respondents, PTI Sindh general secretary Ali Ahmed Palh petitioned the SHC and submitted that the party had approached the district and provincial administration on a number of occasions for permission or no-objection certificate to hold a public gathering, but to no avail.
The petitioner submitted that initially, an application was filed with the DC concerned on March 21 seeking permission to hold a public meeting on April 21, at a ground adjacent to Mazar-i-Quaid from 4pm to midnight and proper access for people to the venue without any hindrance.
The petitioner also asserted that he had a detailed meeting with the DC regarding the process and timely permission and the deputy commissioner had agreed upon venue and timing of such public gathering.
However, he maintained that since the DC had not granted the NOC, the petitioner moved another identical application on March 27, but no response was forthcoming and therefore, the party was forced to change the intended date by a week (April 28) and approached the chief secretary and commissioner, but they also remained unable to make a decision on the subject matter.

“Karachi is not only economic and financial hub of Pakistan but it is gateway to a number of tourist places,” he said and hoped that it would help strengthening people to people contacts as well as tourism in both the country.
Ambassador of Azerbaijan Farhadov said that direct flights would open new avenues for bringing people of both the brotherly countries more closer who were tied in bonds of brotherhood from centuries, according to an APP report.
“We are historically very close and leadership of both the countries had taken significant steps to develop a mechanism for bringing people of both the countries closer,” he said adding that it would contribute to strengthen bilateral relations of Azerbaijan and Pakistan.

KARACHI: There’s a poignant line in William Shakespeare’s King Lear. Earl of Gloucester, after losing his eyesight and misunderstanding one of his sons at a heavy cost, says, “I stumbled when I saw.” The reference here is to the spiritual awakening which is achieved after losing the visual sense, a physical attribute. 
Dolphins found in the Indus River are unlike that: they are ‘sightless’ but have ‘high sonar capabilities’. Add what adds to the beauty of this creature is that it exudes innocence like very few creatures in the universe. 
They need to be taken care of by the authorities concerned with great seriousness because not only this lovely species is an integral part of nature’s munificence but adds to its aesthetical dimension. 
A two-person show titled Hungry Shores featuring works of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Saba Khan that’s under way at the Canvas Art Gallery highlights both the plight and beauty of the blind dolphin.
According to the information provided by the gallery, last year in the month of March, Saba Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto visited Guddu Barrage and Sukkur Barrage for research on the habitat of blind Indus River dolphin. As a result, what the viewer gets to see in the show is an inspiring range of more than a dozen artworks. 
Khan uses oil on canvas to highlight the sightlessness of the species feelingly. Feelingly: because the artist comes up with a poetic personification of the species in exhibits such as ‘Lightness’, allowing the viewer to empathise with it.
Bhutto presents his noteworthy craft through his Bulhan Nameh (dolphin diaries) in works like ‘Play’ by using cyanotype on khaddar, broadening the dolphin space into a world of infinite possibilities where man and cetacean can coexist in harmony. Do they? That’s the question the viewer needs to ask themselves.
Apart from that, there are audio and video presentations on the subject that complement the theme of the show well.
The exhibition will continue till April 25.

7,KU research facility staff protests  over non-payment of salaries,"Affected employees of Centre of Excellence in Marine Biology seek HEC chairman, varsity’s VC’s intervention","KARACHI: The staff of the Centre of Excellence in Marine Biology (CEMB) at Karachi University (KU) held another protest on the campus for the third consecutive day on Friday over non-payment of their salaries for the past three months.
Sources said the CEMB, directly funded by the Higher Education Commission (HEC), had been facing a serious financial crisis following significant deduction in its grant and that too was released on a quarterly basis after prolonged delay.
Currently, they said, 40 teaching and non-teaching staff members were associated with the KU facility.
“We are constantly being deprived of our fundamental right to on-time payment of our monthly salary. This time, we are forced to spend even our Eid without salaries,” said Dr Faiz Muhammad, an assistant professor at CEMB, adding that the staff was forced to hold protests for their salaries after every three months.
The protesters appealed to KU Vice Chancellor Dr Khalid Iraqi, also the chairman of CEMB’s Board of Governors, and the chairman of the Higher Education Commission to intervene in the matter.

Affected employees of Centre of Excellence in Marine Biology seek HEC chairman, varsity’s VC’s intervention

Sources said that the prolonged delay in salaries had forced some staff members to go on leave while others had found part-time jobs.
The worst affected, they said, were the pensioners as some of them were deprived of their dues pending for years.
“There is a major deduction in the facility’s funds and that too is released on a quarterly basis. Almost 45 per cent of the total funds we get go into payment of pensions to 40 retired staff members,” an administrative officer at CEMB told Dawn, adding that the facility had asked the HEC to set up a separate pension fund.
He hoped that the funds would be released next week.
“We are finding it very tough to pay on-services employees their salaries since the facility has a high number of retired staff members and there is no separate fund for them,” a senior teacher said.
According to him, the financial crisis has hard hit research at the facility. 
“Not a single penny is received for research. Hence, lab infrastructure, classrooms and research equipment are in poor condition. Two of the four vehicles meant for research activities are out of order for a long time. Fortunately, however, faculty members compete for individual research projects and often win grants from private organisations,” he explained.
He also shared that the facility headed by an assistant professor hadn’t seen a selection board since 2010 and that there was a special case of a senior teacher who was deprived of his salary for 10 months.
Dawn tried to reach out the in-charge of the CEMB and KU Vice chancellor but they weren’t available for comments.

8,Experts call for educating schoolchildren about climate change,KARACHI: Environment experts on Friday called for providing climate change education to schoolchildren as they were...,"KARACHI: Environment experts on Friday called for providing climate change education to schoolchildren as they were the future leaders and could contribute greatly to environment cleaning and greening.
They were speaking at an advocacy seminar for schools’ leadership, organised with the support of the US Mission in Pakistan in partnership with the Pakistan US Alumni Network at Lincoln Corner in Liaquat Library Karachi.
Bhavita Kumari from the Institute for Global Health and Development, Aga Khan University, said that climate change had been badly affecting socio-economic conditions, public health, and the environment of the country. 
Increasing temperatures in Sindh and Balochistan had a direct impact on the health of people, particularly children and, therefore, there was a need to tackle climate change impacts to save our Planet and the young generation, she added.
Shahpur Jamal of Bay View Academy said that the world climate had significantly changed, particularly in Pakistan as such heavy rains were not seen in April and May five years ago. Dubai, which used to receive rare and very light rains after a gap of several years, had been hit by torrential rains that had affected social and business life across the city, he added.
He said: “In the next 20 years, the impacts of climate change will be devastating. Developed countries are generating more greenhouse gasses by using fossil fuels and other energies while undeveloped countries contribute very little to the greenhouse gases.”
He added that earth’s temperature had risen by 1.2 degrees centigrade since the late 19th Century due to human activities, like the use of fossil fuels. Solar, wind, and hydropower energy, however, offered sustainable alternatives to reduce greenhouse gases, he informed.
Zahid Abbasi, secretary to the Sindh Government, said climate change syllabus had been introduced in the school curriculum. He stressed the need to tackle climate change and start tree plantations in schools with the involvement of children. “The private sector has played a great role in Karachi so we will collaborate with this sector to tackle climate change,” he added.
Dr Fozia Parveen from the Insitute of Educational Development, Aga Khan University, urged school teachers to provide environmental education to the students so that they could gain awareness about water conservation, climate change, and proper waste disposal.
She said that teachers’ jobs should not be limited to education and awareness but should also be about changing students’ behaviours for environment conservation and cleaning.
Ms Parveen added that the agriculture sector was now fast progressing and becoming like the industrial sector so children should also be involved in food production, adding that field trips for people, particularly, children, were also needed to show them the changing environment.
Rafia Javed Mallah of the Sindh Education and Literacy Department said that climate change was a phenomenon that all need to learn about and tackle its impacts. She stressed the need to educate and motivate people to save the planet.

The Global Water Summit is the flagship water sector event of the year, renowned for its industry-leading agenda and the high concentration of water sector executives that attend each year.
A KWSC press statement said that the water utility chief was selected as Member Steering Committee at the GWS on April 17 by the Global Water Intelligence, the leading publisher and events organizer serving the international water industry.
According to the press statement several leading utilities expressed their willingness to work closely with KWSC on the areas like non-revenue reduction plan, customer relationships management, water quality improvement, water filtration with new media, sludge treatment and reuse at wastewater treatment plants.
Mr Salauddin highlighted the importance of effective governance in addressing global water challenges at the summit where ongoing institutional reforms and modernizing of the water utility were also discussed at length.
The conference theme, “Security for a Changing Planet,” aligned with the pressing need to address water security issues in the face of climate change. Over 850 delegated around the world attended the summit.
The Global Water Summit provides a platform for peer to peer learning, student-mentor relationships amongst utilities and gives ample opportunity to bring digital solutions to many problems faced by water utilities besides bringing in investment opportunities.r

Organised by The Knowledge Forum, the webinar brought together prominent voices from academia, media, and civil society to address concerns surrounding the fairness and transparency of general elections in the country.
During the discussion, the speakers highlighted the challenges facing Pakistan’s electoral system, particularly regarding the rights of citizens to freely elect their representatives.
Educationist Dr Naazir Mahmood spoke about the importance of electoral integrity and called for measures to reduce the influence of money in politics. He highlighted the need for transparency in political parties’ operations and stressed the significance of empowering common people to participate in the electoral process.
“Electoral integrity is crucial for a vibrant democracy, but in Pakistan, free, fair, and transparent elections are rare,” said Dr Mahmood while reflecting on the current electoral process. “The current system disproportionately favors the moneyed class, making it difficult for ordinary citizens to contest elections and represent their communities,” he added.
Dr Mahmood also pointed out that interference of the state institutions in the electoral process had marred their credibility and transparency of the electoral process, adding that there was a lack of democratic practices among all political parties in Pakistan as they avoided intra-party elections, which raised the impression of dynastic politics in the country.
Media professional Laiba Khan raised concerns about the electoral process’s independence and the alleged rigging in recent elections. She emphasised the role of digital media in promoting civic engagement and urged for greater freedom of the press and expression.
“Recent elections have raised serious doubts about the fairness of the electoral process,” she said, adding that issues like media censorship must be addressed and the separation of powers be ensured between the executive and judicial branches. “The use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and transparent education systems can help enhance transparency and accountability in the electoral process,” said Ms Khan.
According to her, a ban on social media during and after the elections, which is still going on some social media platforms, has created uncertainty and doubts.
The speakers also called for judicial reforms to safeguard the independence of the judiciary and protect the rights of journalists and civil society organisations. Both speakers cited distressing incidents of persecution and harassment endured by media personnel and activists. The discussion also referred to actions against the civil society organisations, which continued to face restrictions and state persecution.
Director of The Knowledge Forum Zeenia Shaukat spoke about the importance of credible elections as a critical democratic exercise. She also highlighted the need for approaching democracy as a system that went beyond elections and upheld public’s will through fostering state-society relations, political participation, civil liberties and accountability of institutions.

Amid increasing circular debt and rising line losses, a nationwide effort is being made to counter electricity theft across the country.
Use of kundas or makeshift connection is not only illegal but also bypasses the safety protocols, creating a grave safety hazard for residents and increasing the risk of short circuits, fires, and disruptions to the power supply.
A KE spokesperson appreciated the support of law enforcement agencies and various organisations in addressing the challenge of electricity theft, reiterating that the company extended its full support to customers, area representatives and elected officials who wished to work with the company to address this issue together.

12,Court orders probe into lawyers’ alleged involvement in criminal activities,"Petitioner tells court drug peddlers in garb of advocates rig polls, seeks postponement of HDBA election","HYDERABAD: A division bench of Sindh High Court’s Hyderabad circuit comprising Justice Shamsuddin Abbasi and Justice Amjad Ali Sahito on Thursday ordered an inquiry into the allegations that criminal elements existed within the rank and file of lawyer fraternity and they, in the garb of bar members, used to influence voters with the aim of getting their favourites elected in elections.  
Advocate Mohammad Bux alias Waheed Karan Shoro, has in his petition alleged that these elements were involved in drug peddling and other criminal activities. He has prayed the court to order postponement of the Hyderabad District Bar Association (HDBA) elections scheduled for April 20 and order an inquiry to expose lawyers, as well as government officials, found involved in narcotics trade and rigging in the elections.   
The bench ordered the Hyderabad SSP, Amjad Shaikh, to conduct the inquiry and submit his report before the bench by May 15, when the matter would be taken up again at 11am. The SSP would submit his report through SHC’s additional registrar.
Advocate Shoro had earlier raised the same issue in November last year before then caretaker Sindh chief minister retired Justice Maqbool Baqar during the latter’s visit to the High Court Bar Association office.

Petitioner tells court drug peddlers in garb of advocates rig polls, seeks postponement of HDBA election

When the matter came up for hearing on Thursday (April 18), the judges expressed their concern over the issues raised by petitioner Advocate Shoro. Justice Abbasi asked High Court Bar Association (HCBA) President Ayaz Tunio if he was doing anything over the allegations. Advocate Tunio sought time to look into the matter and said he would comply with court’s order when issued in the light of the inquiry report.
‘Secret inquiry’
During the hearing Justice Sahito said that the bench would get a ‘secret inquiry’ conducted by an SSP and Intelligence Bureau (IB) into the matter. However, the order passed during the course of the day contained directive for inquiry by the Hyderabad SSP alone. The bench also issued directive that the order passed on Feb 22 and the memo of petition should be sent to the SSP. 
Petitioner Shoro has cited the home secretary, Sindh inspector general of police, Hyderabad SSP, Sindh Bar Council (SBC) secretary and presidents of the HCBA and HDBA as respondents. 
Rigging in elections
The petitioner has informed court that there had been complaints about incidents of ‘systematic rigging’ during bars’ 2024 elections which proved correct the apprehensions that the prescribed code of conduct was not followed in administrative affairs. “Lately, it has emerged that some criminal elements under the garb of ‘advocates’ entered the legal fraternity and pretended to be members of bar associations,” he submitted in court, and lamented that “they look at elections every year after obtaining favourable results through manipulation and illegal practices”.
According to the petitioner, these elements serve vested interests and misuse powers of the two bars for activities prohibited under law. They use to influence bars’ office-bearers on the basis of their votes to get personal benefits which needs to be stopped. These elements are involved in sale of narcotics and other criminal activities. 
Advocate’s arrest mentioned
The petitioner also submitted in court that one advocate, enroled with a bar, was arrested with a huge cache of psychotropic substance (ice).
He pointed out that the Hyderabad SSP had met HCBA and HDBA office-bearers in this regard and provided them with evidence to seek action against the arrested advocate as well as some other lawyers believed to be involved in unlawful activities. “Then an inquiry committee was formed and its report revealed that not only that fellow but other advocates were also misusing HCBA and HDBA,” the petitioner informed the bench.
Advocate Shoro suggested that biometric system should be implemented in line with Supreme Court’s relevant order and the system could be used to verify lawyers’ registration in a practical manner.
Formation of JIT urged

Speaking to them at a wheat procurement centre near Bhan Syedabad town, their leaders Ghulam Nabi Gambhir, Nizam Gambhir, Ashiq Brohi, Asif Memon and Gul Zaman condemned the corrupt practices by food officials who, they alleged, were giving away gunny bags only to influential growers and turning away abadgars (small growers) empty handed. They also alleged that the officials posted at the procurement centres were also charging Rs200 per wheat bag to buy their produce and that too at a much lower price than the official rate. All these injustices were causing heavy losses to abadgars, they deplored, and raised slogans against the area’s Food Inspector Rajab Panhwar.
They said that such corrupt practices were witnessed at the wheat procurement centres in Bhan Syedabad, Wahur, Bobak, Arazi, Dwanbha, Tilti and Lakki Shah Saddar areas.
They deplored that small farmers had already incurred heavy losses while buying urea fertiliser at an exorbitantly high rates during the sowing season and now they were being denied gunny bags and official rate of their produce. The losses ran into millions of rupees as wheat growers were being made to sell away their crop at a throwaway price after producing the commodity at a very high cost due to an unprecedented increase in the prices of all agricultural inputs and fuel.   
They appealed to the CM to look into their grievances and save them from the heavy losses that were bound to devastate them economically.
They also demanded stern action against corrupt officials of the food department and extortionists.
