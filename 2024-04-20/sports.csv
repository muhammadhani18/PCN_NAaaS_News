1,Under trial prisoner dies due to alleged police torture,"Petitioner contends his son was unlawfully detained, murdered by police","A man, under trial in a case of theft, died in police custody purportedly due to torture inflicted by the SHO of the City Police Station and other police personnel.
On the order of the court, a case was filed against six police officers, including the SHO, in connection with the youth's demise during an investigation. However, the authorities dismissed the case the same day, prompting outcry from the victim's family and the community.
Three months ago, SHO Akram Shehbaz and officers Irfan Cheema and others conducted a raid on the residence of Hameed, a resident of Chongi 8 in Daska.
The raid was aimed at apprehending Muhammad Hameed's son, Usman. The police demanded Usman's surrender, threatening to detain his family if he was not produced.
Hameed informed the police that Usman was at work and would be brought to the police station in the evening.
Later that day, Hameed, along with Usman and Owais, visited the City Police Station. However, SHO Akram Shehbaz allegedly detained Usman without formal arrest.
On March 26 Muhammad Hameed received news from the police that Usman had died during questioning, with his body lying at the Civil Hospital Sialkot. While police attributed Usman's death to an epileptic seizure, the victim's family vehemently refutes this, alleging that Usman was killed through torture.
In response, the victim's father submitted a formal complaint, accusing SHO Akram Shahbaz, Investigating Officer Waris, Irfan Cheema, Mumtaz Head Constable, Babar Aziz, and an unidentified individual of torturing Usman to death.
The district court presided over by Additional Sessions Judge Khalid Bashir wrote in a verdict that the death of the petitioner's son, Usman, occurred while in the custody of the City Daska Police Station.
“Despite completing the detention period for various robbery cases, Usman was not transferred to jail. The court found it suspicious that Usman was taken to Imran Idrees Hospital in Sialkot instead of DHQ Hospital Gujranwala, as recommended by doctors at Civil Hospital Daska.”
The judge further noted that discrepancies were noted in the entry record at Imran Idrees Hospital, suggesting tampering.
“Although the police were aware of Usman's identity, they falsely labelled him as an “unknown” individual while transporting his body. The petitioner contends that his son was unlawfully detained and subsequently murdered by the police. In light of these circumstances, the court concluded that an FIR should be filed against the perpetrators.”
On the other hand, counsel for Usman, Advocate Ijaz Ashraf Goraya said that the court sent Usman to jail and then “unlawfully” handed him over to the police custody, even though there is no law allowing a suspect to be transferred from judicial custody to police custody for three days, upon which the police have filed fake cases.
The police also included charges against Usman when he was only 14-year-old, and false allegations were made against him. These cases are now part of the record, including the judicial proceedings. Now, these cases will also come to light.
This highlights the impunity of the police. Furthermore, although it was determined by court orders that there had been a murder, both the homicide and the police did not waste any time and without any inquiry, they either released the suspects or gave them clean chits.
He said the police's sole purpose was to extort money and engage in corruption.
“The police have become the uncrowned king of corruption these days and are openly violating human rights. In recent days, around 22 people have been killed in fake encounters, with no judicial record for any of them,” he said.
“In all these cases, the judiciary is also not playing its role; instead, it is silently observing all the proceedings and in many cases, the judiciary's assistance is also being obtained by the police.”

2,LHC orders replacement of environment officers,Action taken in response to inadequate measures to combat smog,"The Lahore High Court (LHC) issued directives to the authorities concerned on Friday for the replacement of three officers from the environment department due to their failure to address environmental pollution effectively.
The court instructed the director-general of Environment to promptly replace the deputy directors of environment in Lahore and Sheikhupura, as well as an assistant director of Environment in Lahore. Additionally, the court mandated taking disciplinary action against them under the PEEDA ACT.
Justice Shahid Karim issued these orders during the hearing of petitions filed by Haroon Farooq and others concerning inadequate measures to combat smog. Initially, members of the Judicial Water and Environment Commission and the law officers of the relevant departments appeared before the court and submitted reports.
Hina Hafeezullah, a commission member, presented a report stating that factories previously sealed for environmental violations were allowed to operate again in collaboration with Environment department officials.
Expressing grave concern over this revelation, the court demanded the immediate replacement of the implicated officers and the director-general of Environment Punjab. However, upon a request from the commission member, the court granted an opportunity for the director-general of Environment to present their case.
During the proceedings, the court also inquired about the plans of the Central Business District (CBD) Punjab for a 100-acre area. The CBD lawyer revealed that the CBD was executing a project for the Punjab government.
The commission member informed the court about the alarming trend of housing societies encroaching on agricultural land, posing potential food security threats.
In response, Justice Shahid Karim underscored the gravity of the situation and urged the government to address it earnestly. The CBD lawyer highlighted the proliferation of illegal housing societies around Lahore, emphasizing the need for a coherent policy to regulate them. Consequently, the court adjourned further proceedings until the next week and requested implementation reports.

3,Enhanced wheat target likely,Punjab Food Dept gears up for more procurement,"The Punjab government is likely to set a big target for official purchase of wheat in view of demands by farmers and political leaders.
According to sources, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz decided during a meeting with Pakistan Kisan Ittehad leader Khalid Mehmood Khokhar to set the government procurement target for wheat. She also assured the farmers’ representative that the limits announced regarding the area and number of gunny bags to be issued for the procurement would be revised.
The Kisan Ittehad leader has demanded that the food department's wheat procurement target should be set at 3.5 million tonnes. He also called for replacement of the limit of issuing six bags per acre for six acres of land with 200 sacks.
The sources said the food department had started arrangements to meet the procurement target. An ‘indent’ has been prepared for gunny bags for the purchase of wheat.
A summary of posting of field staff for the procurement has also been approved by the Chief Minister's Office.
Meanwhile, the farmers and flour mill owners are also demanding action by the federal government against the authorities working under the caretaker set-up involved in importing more than 800,000 tonnes of surplus wheat by altering a decision to ban the import on February 14. Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzaib had also termed the surplus import a major drawback.
For the first time in history, the Punjab cabinet had not set an official target for wheat procurement for the food department. The government had decided that the department would purchase less wheat.
However, the policy drew criticism from farmers' organisations and political parties.
Lawmakers from the opposition as well as the ruling coalition had criticised the wheat policy in the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz invited the head of Pakistan Kisan Ittehad and discussed the situation.
PML-N leader Pervaiz Rasheed, Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman, Food Minister Bilal Yasin, Agriculture Minister Ashiq Kirmani and Principal Secretary Sajid Zafar Dal attended the meeting, the sources said.
They said Khalid Khokhar termed the government's wheat policy tantamount to economic massacre of farmers.
He said that in the past 76 years, the governments had bought wheat by breaking into farmers' homes and warehouses, seizing their trolleys from the roads and taking them to food department centres, and making grain markets no-go areas for them. He said the governments had given billions of rupees in subsidy while farmers bore the bank interest on loans.
He said now the Punjab government should buy wheat for the sake of the farmers this year even if it had to face a loss while saving them.
Khokhar said that if the price of wheat is not paid adequately, the farmers would not be able to buy fertilisers and pesticides for cultivating maize and mustard, while the wheat cultivation next year would also drop.
The source said some participants of the meeting had said the government was offering relief to the farmer owning up to six acres of land, but he growers’ leader said those owning 12.5 acres had been officially considered small farmers.
Khokhar said the food department should buy at least 3.5 million tonnes of fresh wheat. He said a minimum of 200 sacks should be given to a farmer and the support price of wheat in Punjab should be Rs4,700 per maund.
He also called for action over the import of surplus wheat.
The food department had earlier purchased jute bags, after which it has the capacity to purchase 1.9 million tonnes of wheat. However, preparations are under way to buy PP bags for millions of tonnes more.
An approval will also be sought from the federal government to take loans from banks for purchasing the wheat.
Under the government policy, online procedures had been included in the procurement process but these provisions may also be revised, the sources said.

6,Plea about naming infrastructure dismissed,"Petition aimed to eradicate the association of streets, roads, government institutes to political figures","Lahore High Court (LHC) Justice Shahid Kareem has dismissed a plea seeking to declare the naming of public infrastructure after politicians and ruling elites in Punjab as “illegal”.
The petition, filed by Mushkoor Hussain, aimed to eradicate the association of streets, roads, government institutes, and cities with political figures.
During the proceedings, Justice Kareem expressed frustration over such petitions, labelling them as time-consuming for the courts.
He advised the petitioner's lawyer to focus on more substantial legal matters instead.
Hussain's petition named several government officials as respondents, including the chief secretary and secretaries of various departments.
He argued that renaming public facilities after political figures reflected a mindset of treating public assets as personal domains of political and feudal lords.
Citing examples like the recent change of Imam Bibi Maternity Hospital to Khawaja Safdar Hospital, Hussain highlighted the prevalence of such practices across Punjab. He emphasised that public infrastructure should not be monopolised by politicians and elites, stressing that these assets belong to all citizens.
The petitioner criticised the lack of logic behind naming or renaming roads, parks, and institutes after individuals without considering their contributions to society.
He warned against the misuse of authority to gain personal recognition, which could undermine the efforts of genuine contributors to the nation's progress.

7,Mystery surrounds bodies missing from graves,"Discovery triggers fear, speculation in village","In a village under the jurisdiction of Laksian police station, situated 30 kilometres from Sargodha city, bodies had been vanishing from graves in the local cemetery, sparking widespread fear and unease among the populace.
Ahmad Yar, the gravedigger of the village, raised the alarm on April 17, informing villagers that several graves had been tampered with at the Mauza Sewar cemetery, with bodies missing from them.
Upon receiving this alarming news, villagers gathered at the village cemetery.
Yar further said the disturbed graves included both new and old ones.
Local residents reported that more than a dozen graves had been desecrated, with bodies or skeletal remains removed from them.
Shehbaz Nethar, an advocate from the nearby area of Laksian, also visited the village and informed The Express Tribune that dozens of graves had been disturbed, with bones and remains taken from them.
He mentioned that among the desecrated graves, ten belonged to children, while two contained the remains of elderly individuals.
Suspicions have arisen among the villagers, suggesting the involvement of a group in the village engaged in the practice of using human bones and remains for magical purposes or medicinal concoctions.
Following the unsettling disappearances from the Mauza Sewar graveyard, concerns have escalated among the local populace about the safety of their deceased loved ones.
Residents reported the incident to the Laksian police station. Upon receiving the report, personnel from the Laksian police station and ASP Kot Momin, Akhtar Nawaz, arrived at the scene to investigate.
Authorities registered a case and apprehended four suspects in connection with the incident.
Police confirmed that they are conducting a thorough investigation into all aspects of the case and are currently interrogating the detained individuals.
They assured that the main perpetrators behind the grave desecration would be apprehended soon.
Amidst speculations surrounding the theft of bodies from the graves, some local residents believe that the disturbances may not be the work of a group but rather attributed to the deteriorated condition of some older graves due to neglect, while others speculate that wild animals may have been responsible for digging up certain graves.
