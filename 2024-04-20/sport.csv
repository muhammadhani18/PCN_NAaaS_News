0,Germany manager Nagelsmann extends contract until 2026,"""Together we now want to play a successful home European Championship, we are all burning for it,"" says Nagelsmann.","BERLIN: Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann has extended his contract until the conclusion of the next World Cup in 2026, the German Football Association (DFB) said on Friday.
Nagelsmann replaced Hansi Flick as Germany coach last September and had initially signed a contract to the end of Euro 2024, which Germany will host in June.
The 36-year-old has enjoyed a mixed start to his reign, but recently won back-to-back friendlies against France and Netherlands and will have two further warm-up games with Ukraine and Greece in June before the Euros, where they will face Scotland, Hungary and Switzerland in the group stage.
“With successful, passionate performances, we have the chance to sweep an entire country along. The two victories against France and the Netherlands in March gave a foretaste of this,” Nagelsmann said in a statement.
“I was very touched by the enthusiasm of the fans. Together we now want to play a successful home European Championship, we are all burning for it. After that, I’m really looking forward to the challenge of a World Cup together with my coaching team.”
Nagelsmann had been linked with managerial jobs in both the Premier League and the Bundesliga.
“It is a strong signal for the DFB and the national team that Julian Nagelsmann will remain national coach beyond the home European Championship. Because he is on the wish list of many big clubs all over Europe,” DFB President Bernd Neuendorf said.
“But the national team is more than just a job for Julian Nagelsmann, it’s a real affair close to his heart. Now there is planning security, and everyone can concentrate fully on a successful performance at the European Championship.”

1,"Coleman focused on US trials, not Olympics",XIAMEN: Christian Coleman admitted on Friday to being more focused on safely negotiating the notoriously tough US...,"XIAMEN: Christian Coleman admitted on Friday to being more focused on safely negotiating the notoriously tough US trials than the actual Paris Olympics, where he hopes he will bid for a sprint double.
Coleman, who beat teammate Noah Lyles to 60 metres gold in the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow in February, had to sit out the Covid-delayed Tokyo Games after missing a drugs test.
He donned a US vest at the 2016 Rio Olympics, where he ran the heats for the Justin Gatlin-led 4x100m relay squad that was eventually disqualified in the final won by Usain Bolt’s Jamaica.
“I can’t even think past June right now, just focused on being our absolute best when we need to be at the trials,” Coleman said ahead of the opening Diamond League meeting of the season in the Chinese city of Xiamen.
“If you’re not at your best there then the season’s all for nought, really.
“That’s what makes it so special to be on the American team — the fact it’s so hard to make it.”
Coleman, along with teammate Fred Kerley — the 2022 world champion and Olympic silver medallist — holds the joint sixth fastest time over 100m ever run (9.76sec) and acknowledged that the US would have a very strong 4x100m relay squad in Paris.
“Hopefully I can start the year off on a good note,” said Coleman, who was world outdoor 100m champion in 2019 before his doping suspension.
“Everyone’s goal is first to make the team but whoever makes that team is obviously well capable of getting on that relay pool and doing something special. The world record is definitely within our reach.”
Coleman admitted that competing in an Olympic year felt  “a little different because you know the magnitude of it”.
“I feel like it would be unrealistic not to acknowledge the fact that it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that not many people have the opportunity to even experience, being in your prime and actually having a realistic chance of making it to the Olympics.”
Coleman added:  “As far as the process is concerned, we do this every year, so it’s really no different. You just try not to pay too much attention to outside factors and outside pressures.
“The main thing is focus on what’s right in front of you, one day at a time. That’s the same process every year, it’s just a bigger opportunity.”
Saturday’s meeting in Xiamen, the first of back-to-back Diamond League meets in China, with a second in Shanghai on April 27, will also see women’s world 100m champion Sha’Carri Richardson in action in the 200m.
Coleman dubbed Richardson, who also won 200m bronze at the Budapest worlds,  “special”.
“She’s somebody who’s at the forefront of women’s empowerment in sport, she’s taken it to a whole different level.
“She’s a beast, a special talent, she’s somebody who’s going to continue to propel the sport forward and take it to new heights.
“I’m a fan,” he said.  “She’s someone I take inspiration from.”
Also in action in Xiamen, the first of 15 meets on the elite one-day track and field circuit, are 12 Olympic gold medallists, notably Swedish pole vault star Mondo Duplantis and Qatar’s three-time world high jump champion Mutaz Essa Barshim.

2,EFL denies it agreed to scrap FA Cup replays,LONDON: England’s football powers locked horns on Friday as a row erupted over the scrapping of FA Cup replays ...,"LONDON: England’s football powers locked horns on Friday as a row erupted over the scrapping of FA Cup replays with the lower leagues saying they had been cut out of the decision process after an angry reaction from clubs who fear losing revenue.
The FA announced the move on Thursday to scrap replays in England’s biggest cup competition from next season, prompting criticism and calls to re-evaluate from several lower league clubs with both the government and opposition Labour party commenting on the decision.
English football’s governing body issued a statement on Friday saying representatives from the English Football League (EFL), made up of the three divisions directly below the top flight Premier League, agreed in meetings to ditch replays.
The EFL, however, said the final decision was made by the FA and Premier League alone.
“We have been discussing the calendar for 2024-25 season with the Pre­mier League and EFL for we­ll over a year,” the FA said.
“Removing Emirates FA Cup replays was discussed in the early meetings and all parties accepted that they could not continue.”
The EFL, however, said they did discuss the matter with the FA in September but there was no agreement in place before the change was announced.
“The agreement which now sees the abolition of replays from the competition format was agreed sol­e­ly between Premier Lea­gue and FA,” the EFL said.
“Ahead of the deal being announced there was no agreement with the EFL nor was there any formal consultation with EFL Clubs as members of the FA and participants in the competition.”
The FA said the new calendar was approved by the Professional Game Board, which has representatives from both the Premier League and the EFL, then by the FA Board where the National League and grassroots game was represented as well.

3,Federations slam Olympic prize money for athletics,LAUSANNE: An organisation of Olympic sports federations on Friday said the decision by World Athletics to award ...,"LAUSANNE: An organisation of Olympic sports federations on Friday said the decision by World Athletics to award prize money to gold medallists in its events  “undermines the values of Olympism”.
The Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) released a statement which made clear how unhappy it was at the announcement by World Athletics president Sebastian Coe that track and field gold medallists at the Paris Games will receive $50,000 (47,000 euros).
World Athletics’ move, announced last week, was a first for a federation at an Olympics. It said it would extend prize money to all medallists in Los Angeles in four years’ time.
ASOIF, which has 30 full members and two associate members, said:  “This move undermines the values of Olympism and the uniqueness of the Games. One cannot and should not put a price on an Olympic gold medal.
“This disregards the less privileged athletes lower down the final standings.”
It said other Olympic sports cannot afford to offer prize money.
“Not all sports could or should replicate this move, even if they wanted to,” said ASOIF.
The organisation added that it accepted schemes by National Olympic Committees and governments to  “reward athletes for outstanding performances...for purposes of national pride and ...consistently across all the sports at the Olympic Games.”
It also said that there had been a consensus that, where sports had a surplus, Olympic revenue should  “be invested as a priority into development and integrity.”
The organisation was also unhappy that Coe had announced the move without warning to its fellow federations, although it had informed the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on the day of the announcement.
“ASOIF was neither informed nor consulted in advance of the announcement, which was made one day after the ASOIF General Assembly,” it said, adding  “it is important and fair to discuss the matter at stake with the other federations in advance”.
World Athletics responded in a statement to AFP that its decision to award prize money was  “about underscoring our unwavering commitment to empowering the athletes and recognising the critical role they play in the success of any Olympic Games”.
It said it agreed it was impossible to put a  “marketable value” on winning an Olympic medal.
“But we think it is important to make sure some of the revenues generated by our athletes at the Olympic Games are directly returned to those who make the Games the global spectacle that it is,” World Athletics added.
The total World Athletics prize fund of $2.4 million will come from IOC’s revenue share allocation that the federation receives every four years.

4,‘All-or-nothing’ Norris takes sprint pole in rain chaos at Chinese GP,SHANGHAI: A fearless  “all or nothing” lap from McLaren’s Lando Norris in wet and wild conditions on Friday...,"SHANGHAI: A fearless  “all or nothing” lap from McLaren’s Lando Norris in wet and wild conditions on Friday denied Lewis Hamilton pole position for the Chinese Grand Prix sprint race.
Hamilton thought he had claimed Shanghai pole in his Mercedes when Norris’s lap of 1min 57.940sec on intermediate wet tyres was deleted for exceeding track limits, only to be dramatically reinstated a minute later.
Fernando Alonso in an Aston Martin showed his experience and guile to come third in the treacherous conditions with championship leader Max Verstappen fourth.
It was a second career sprint pole for Norris.
“It was tricky, you are always nervous going into a session like this,” said the Englishman. “You just have to risk a lot, push and build tyre temperature and what not. You only get three laps. The first two I aborted on both, so it was all or nothing.”
Verstappen’s Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez was sixth, splitting the Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc, who survived a big spin.
“It was just like driving on ice,” said Verstappen, whose final lap time was deleted after a trip across the gravel outside the final bend.
“That is why also I think we deserved to be where we are in qualifying, it isn’t really working for me in the wet but it is not where we are in the dry.” Hamilton has endured a poor start to 2024 but was clearly looking forward to starting from the front row.
“So happy, as soon as I saw the rain coming I was getting excited. In dry conditions we’re not quick enough.”
Alonso was also thankful for the late rain.  “We were not super competitive on the dry,” he said.
“In the wet it was difficult to judge the level of grip and risk we wanted to apply but in the end I am happy.”
Fifth-placed Sainz said the rain and cool conditions made it very difficult to get his intermediate tyres warmed up.
“We didn’t manage to switch on the tyres so we couldn’t push,” said the Spaniard, the only driver to win a race this season apart from Verstappen.
Formula One is back in China for the first time since 2019, when Hamilton won.
A big crowd at the Shanghai International Circuit let out a huge roar when their hometown hero Zhou Guanyu made it into the third qualifying session.
He will start Saturday morning’s sprint from 10th for Sauber.
The 24-year-old Zhou was elevated to F1 in 2022, but has had to wait till his third season to make his home debut because of the pandemic.
Zhou is yet to score a 2024 championship point but has given himself a great chance with a near-flawless qualifying show.
Every lap in his bright green Sauber was greeted by massive cheers from the grandstand opposite the pit lane as his times appeared on the scoreboard.
“We will give it everything,” Zhou said.  “I am just happy with the first day and great to have everyone here.
“The pressure before the weekend was so extreme, like I felt when I made my debut.”
Verstappen, who has won three out of four grands prix this season, again looked quickest until the rain came near the end of SQ2.
It sets up an intriguing 19-lap sprint battle for Saturday morning as the three-time world champion attempts to find his way past Alonso, Hamilton and Norris.
“We have to try and have the best start possible,” said Vers­tappen. “And then I think it will be quite a long stint on one set of tyres in the sprint.” Hamilton said his fate lay with the weather gods.
“It really depends what the conditions will be like,” said the seven-time world champion, who has won a record six grands prix in Shanghai.
“If they are like they were just now we have a chance of being up there.”

5,‘Pakistan to announce new coaches by end of April’,LAHORE: Pakistan will announce new set of coaches for red and white ball formats for the national team by the end of...,"LAHORE: Pakistan will announce new set of coaches for red and white ball formats for the national team by the end of this month, an official of the country’s cricket board official told the Press Trust of India news agency on Friday.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) also confirmed that besides South Africa’s Gary Kirsten and Australia’s Jason Gillispie, the board had received applications from a couple of reputed coaches by the April 15 deadline.
The PCB official said that while they are interested in Kirsten and Gillispie, the new applicants are also in the fray.
“The PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi has made it clear that the long-term appointments of coaches will be done through a due process and all commitments would be met by the board,” the source added.
The last time PCB followed due process in appointing coaches was in 2019 when it named Misbah-ul-Haq as the head coach and chief selector of the national side. Since then, all appointments have either been made on a consultancy or interim basis.
Another reliable source in the PCB said that this time, the board would only invite those candidates for interviews who apply for the coaching positions.
“Even in Kirsten and Gillispie’s case though, the board has held direct negotiations with them, and they remain top candidates to be appointed head coaches, they were also told to apply through due process by the deadline,” the source said.
He admitted that with some interesting candidates have also applied for the head coach’s position, the PCB will require time till the end of the month to reach a decision and make an announcement.
“The PCB chief doesn’t want names disclosed at any stage, and names would only be revealed once announcements are made,” stated the source.
The PCB has also kept April 20 as the deadline for candidates interested in applying for assistant coaches positions.
“Even Azhar Mahmood has to go through the process, and currently, he was named head coach for the New Zealand series on a consultancy basis,” the source added.

6,Olympic chief Bach says AI can be a game changer for athletes,LONDON: IOC president Thomas Bach said artificial intelligence can help identify talented athletes  “in every...,"LONDON: IOC president Thomas Bach said artificial intelligence can help identify talented athletes  “in every corner of the world” as he unveiled the Olympic AI Agenda in London on Friday. 
Bach, speaking at Olympic Park, which hosted the 2012 Games, said the Olympic movement needs to lead change as the global AI revolution gathers pace. 
“Today we are making another step to ensure the uniqueness of the Olympic Games and the relevance of sport, and to do this, we have to be leaders of change, and not the object of change,” said the International Olympic Committee president. 
The former fencing gold medallist said it was vital to have a  “holistic” approach to create an  “overall strategy for AI and sport”. 
Bach, speaking less than 100 days before the start of the Paris Olympics, said  “unlike other sectors of society, we in sport are not confronted with the existential question of whether AI will replace human beings”. 
“In sport, the performances will always have to be delivered by the athletes,” he said.  “The 100 metres will always have to be run by an athlete — a human being. Therefore, we can concentrate on the potential of AI to support the athletes. 
“AI can help to identify athletes and talent in every corner of the world. AI can provide more athletes with access to personalised training methods, superior sports equipment and more individualised programmes to stay fit and healthy.” 
Bach said other advantages of AI included fairer judging, better safeguarding and improved spectator experience. 
The Olympic AI Agenda comes from the IOC AI working group — a high-level panel of global experts including AI pioneers and athletes, set up last year. 
When asked about the potential negatives of AI, Bach was keen to emphasise the importance of free choice in sport. 
“He and she, or the parents, must still have the free choice,” said the German.  “So a guy who is then maybe identified as a great athlete in wrestling must still have the chance to play tennis and cannot be sorted out from these sports.” 
Former Olympic skiing champion Lindsey Vonn, who also spoke at the London event, told AFP she envied current athletes, who could use AI to enhance their training. 
“I’m very jealous that I didn’t have any of this technology when I was racing because I just really feel that it’s going to enhance the athlete’s experience all around,” she said. 
“Athletes can utilise AI in training to enhance their knowledge from training like, for example, skiing on the mountain but then also off the mountain in the gym recovery times,” added the American. 
“The more we understand about your body, about the sport, about performance, the better you can adjust as an athlete.” 
Vonn, 39, also said AI would be a vital tool for talent identification, particularly in nations without the resources to scout talent. 
“You can give them access to AI through a cell phone and you do a series of tests and they can identify ‘OK this athlete would be a great, a 40-metre dash sprinter, or this athlete would potentially be an amazing high jumper,” she said. 
“You have the ability then to find the talent and give them resources through things they already have like a cell phone.” 
Vonn also welcomed plans to use artificial intelligence to shield Olympic athletes from vicious online hate, recounting how she was “wildly harassed” before the 2018 Winter Games. 
“Social media can be a very positive experience but unfortunately I’ve experienced the other side of it, specifically before the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang,” she said. 
“I was wildly harassed, and people were sending me death threats and that was really hard for me. You have enough, as an athlete trying to perform at the Olympics, than to deal with people that you know want you to ski off a cliff. 
“So the fact that AI will be able to in real time take these comments down and not only that but be able to help them prosecute people, that is huge because that will, I think, change the dynamics of social media.”  
Kirsty Burrows, head of the IOC’s Safe Sport Unit, said she was anticipating around half a billion social media posts in Paris. 
“We know that social media and sport are inextricably linked and they present such fantastic opportunities for engagement but unfortunately we also know in this digital age that online violence is something that is pervasive and it’s also inescapable,” she said. 
Burrows said the IOC was working with a technology provider to use AI to “create and foster digitally safe environments” in Paris.

7,"Arsenal, Liverpool fight to keep Premier League race alive","“What we still have to play (for) is beautiful and I said before, it’s time to be next to our players and in this moment, not when you win 10 […] and a draw,” says Arteta.","LONDON: Arsenal have no time to dwell on their Cham­pions League exit as they return to Premier League action this weekend with the chance to reclaim top spot.
Manchester City were the big winners last week, hammering Luton Town 5-1 before Arsenal and Liverpool both lost, and are now firm favourites to claim an unprecedented fourth straight English top-flight title.
But City are in FA Cup semi-final action against Chelsea on Saturday and could find themselves shunted down to third spot.
At the bottom of the table, relegation-threatened Everton and Nottingham Forest, both hit with points deductions, go head to head.Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta says they still have a  “beautiful” opportunity in the title race, but their campaign is in danger of ending in a whimper for the second straight year.
The second-placed Gunners, who face mid-table Wolver­hampton Wanderers on Saturday, led the way in the Premier League for the bulk of last season but faded badly in the run-in, allowing City to cruise past them.
They appeared to have toughened up this campaign, taking four points off both Liverpool and City and going on a run of 10 wins in 11 games.
But last week’s 2-0 home defeat by Aston Villa was a huge blow, compounded by their midweek Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Bayern Munich.
Arteta knows his men need an arm around their shoulders after their  “painful” defeat in Germany.
“What we still have to play (for) is beautiful and I said before, it’s time to be next to our players and in this moment, not when you win 10... and a draw,” he said.
Arsenal must beat Wolves — both to stay in the title hunt and to prove they have what it takes.
Jurgen Klopp’s Premier League title push in his final season at Anfield is running out of momentum after a damaging draw against Manchester United and a shock defeat by Crystal Palace.
Liverpool had 49 shots over the two games but managed just two goals, in the chaotic 2-2 draw with United, telling a tale of wastefulness.
Liverpool had been the masters at winning points from losing positions but they have lost that useful knack, winning just two of their past five league games.
At the other end of the pitch, Klopp’s men, who have struggled with defensive injuries, are struggling to keep clean sheets.
Liverpool, City’s closest challengers during Pep Guardiola’s reign at the Etihad, are not out of the race — like Arsenal they are just two points off the top ahead of Sunday’s match against Fulham.
But unless they rediscover their sharpness at both ends of the pitch, their challenge could quickly be over.
Their mood would not have been improved by crashing out of the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Everton or Forest could find themselves in the relegation zone at the end of the weekend if Luton beat Brentford.
Both clubs have been hit with penalties for breaches of the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules.
Everton have been docked eight points in total for two breaches — a two-point punishment earlier this month followed a six-point penalty, reduced from 10 on appeal.
The club have also appealed against the second penalty.
Forest were docked four points and have also appealed.
Everton, who have been ever-present in the English top-flight since 1954/55, have won just one of their past 15 league matches.
Both clubs will hope their appeals are successful but they cannot afford to rely on a successful outcome as the games run out.
Fixtures: Saturday (1400 GMT unless stated): Luton Town v Brentford, Sheffield United v Burnley, Wolverhampton Wanderers v Arsenal (1830); Sunday: Everton v Nottingham Forest (1230), Aston Villa v Bournemouth (1400), Crystal Palace v West Ham United (1400), Fulham v Liverpool (1530).

8,Liverpool out of Europa League as Leverkusen advance to semis,LONDON: Liverpool crashed out of the Europa League after a 1-0 win against Atalanta that wasn’t enough to overturn...,"LONDON: Liverpool crashed out of the Europa League after a 1-0 win against Atalanta that wasn’t enough to overturn their quarter-final deficit, while Bayer Leverkusen’s 1-1 draw at West Ham United took the German champions into the last four on Thursday.
In Jurgen Klopp’s last season as Liverpool boss, the Reds were hoping to give the German a memorable farewell in the final in Dublin.
But Liverpool had suffered a stun­ning 3-0 loss in the first leg against Atalanta at Anfield last week.
And although Liverpool have authored some of European football’s greatest comebacks down the years against the likes of St Etien­ne, AC Milan and Barcelona, there would be no miracle escape this time.
Mohamed Salah converted a seventh minute penalty in the second leg in Bergamo after Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross hit Matteo Ruggeri’s arm.
However, Klopp’s men couldn’t breach the stubborn Atalanta defence again.
It has been a brutal week for Liverpool, whose Premier League title challenge was damaged by a shock home defeat against Crystal Palace on Sunday.
“It’s mixed emotions. We are out but I’m happy with the game,” Klopp said. “It was clear we gave ourselves a massive hurdle. We wished we could have gone to Dublin but that hasn’t happened.”


VILLENEUVE-d’ASCQ (France): Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez saves the last penalty in a shoot-out during the Europa Conference League quarter-final second leg against Lille at Stade Pierre-Mauroy.—AFP

 
While Klopp contemplates his failure to land the one major trophy to elude him during nine years with Liverpool, Atalanta can dream of winning the second silverware in their 116-year history after the 1963 Coppa Italia.
Bidding to reach their maiden European final, Gian Piero Gasperini’s team will face Olympique de Marseille in their first European semi-final since the 1988 Cup Winners’ Cup.
Fresh from clinching their first Bundesliga title last weekend, Leverkusen survived a scare from West Ham before advancing 3-1 on aggregate.
In the semi-finals, Xabi Alonso’s side will play AS Roma, who saw off Italian rivals AC Milan 3-1 on aggregate.
Leverkusen won the first leg 2-0 but West Ham made the perfect start in east London when Michail Antonio met Jarrod Bowen’s pin-point cross with a close-range header in the 13th minute.
West Ham eventually ran out of steam and Jeremie Frimpong stru­ck in the 89th minute with a shot that deflected in off Aaron Cresswell.
“The momentum was with West Ham. To be honest, we were not at our best in the first half. I’m happy to go through. In the Europa League you always have tough moments,” Alonso said.
Leverkusen are into their second successive Europa League semi-final, while West Ham’s exit means for only the third time in the 21st century, England will have no teams in the Champions League and Europa League last four.
Leverkusen’s 44-game unbe­aten run in all competitions has taken them to the brink of an incredible treble, finally ridding the club of the ‘Neverkusen’ tag that mocked their decades of underachievement.
Alonso’s team, who face second tier Kaiserslautern in the German Cup final on May 25, beat Werder Bremen 5-0 on Sunday to win the Bundesliga title.
At the Stadio Olimpico, Gianluca Mancini put Roma head from close-range in the 12th minute and Paulo Dybala doubled their advantage in the 22nd minute with a blistering strike.
Daniele De Rossi’s side were red­uced to 10 men in the 31st minute when Zeki Celik was dismissed for a foul on Milan forward Rafael Leao.
Matteo Gabbia got one back in the 85th minute, but his header was little consolation for Milan.
After losing last season’s Europa League final against Sevilla, Roma are one step closer to finally winning the competition for the first time.
Roma, who won the Europa Conference League in 2022, are into their fifth European semi-final in the last seven seasons.
In the south of France, Marseille were 4-2 winners in a penalty shoot-out against Benfica following the French side’s 1-0 victory in a tie that finished 2-2 on aggregate.
Faris Moumbagna struck in the 79th minute, heading in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s cross to force extra-time.
In the shoot-out, Luis Henrique scored the winner for Jean-Louis Gasset’s side after Benfica duo Angel Di Maria and Antonio Silva missed their kicks.
MARTINEZ HEROICS SEND VILLA INTO LAST FOUR
Meanwhile in the Europa Conference League fixtures on Thursday, Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez saved two spot kicks and  survived a bizarre red card incident as his side beat French club Lille  on penalties to reach the last-four stage.
Lille  had led 2-0 with goals by Yusuf Yazici and Andre but Matty Cash’s  deflected effort in the 87th minute sent the tie into extra time.
A chaotic match ended 3-3 on aggregate after Lille’s 2-1  victory on the night but the real drama was to come in the shoot-out  with World Cup winner Martinez in the thick of it.
Martinez, who  was shown a yellow card during the game, first saved brilliantly to keep  out Nabil Bentaleb’s effort to give Villa the advantage in the  shoot-out but was warned for his persistent mind games in the Stade  Pierre Mauroy.
The Argentine was then shown a second yellow card  for his antics and appeared to have been sent off only to be reprieved  by the rule which states that yellow cards awa­r­ded during regular time  are not carried forward to penalty shoot-outs.
Villa’s Leon Bailey  then missed his spot kick but Martinez proved the hero as he kept out  Benjamin Andre’s effort to seal a 4-3 shoot-out win for Unai Emery’s  side.
It is the first time Villa have reached a European semi-final since 1982.
Elsewhere on Thursday, last season’s runners-up Fiorentina sealed a return to the semis with a 2-0 win over 10-man Viktoria Plzen after extra time.
Cadu  was sent off in the second half for a foul on the edge of the Plzen box  and Fiorentina made the extra man count when Nico Gonz­alez struck in  the 92nd minute.
Skipper Cristiano Biraghi added a second on 108 minutes as the Italians progressed 2-0 on aggregate.Spanish  striker Ferran Jutgla got both goals for Club Brugge in a 2-0 win in  Greece as the Belgians eased through 3-0 over the two legs.

9,Defending champion Swiatek breezes into Stuttgart quarter-finals,STUTTGART: World num­ber one and defending champion Iga Swiatek progressed to the quarter-finals of the WTA...,"STUTTGART: World num­ber one and defending champion Iga Swiatek progressed to the quarter-finals of the WTA Stuttgart clay-court tournament by beating Elise Mertens in straight sets on Thursday, her ninth win in nine career matches at the French Open warm-up event.
Swiatek beat the unse­eded Belgian 6-3, 6-4 to maintain her bid to capture a third successive title in the German city and be handed the keys to a third luxury car from the sponsors after also winning the tournament in 2022.
“There’s always space for a Porsche. If not, we’ll make it. I’ll build an underground garage,” said Swiatek after playing her first clay-court match since lifting the French Open title last June.
The Pole burst out of the blocks to set up a 5-1 lead in the first set, before going 0-30 down but recovering to serve out the set.
Swiatek was broken early in the second but served her way back into the set, winning with a forehand on her fourth match point after Mertens had saved the previous three.
“This is not an easy tournament. Everyone is really motivated to win that car,” Swiatek added.
The top seed will face former US Open champion Emma Raducanu for a place in the semi-finals.
Raducanu, who helped Britain qualify for the Billie Jean King Cup finals last weekend, took down Czech teenager Linda Noskova 6-0, 7-5.
It will be a first quarter-final appearance for Radu­canu in 19 months. She has been plagued by a raft of injuries since her 2021 Gra­nd Slam breakthrough and missed much of last season.
Ukraine’s Marta Kost­yuk saved five match points at 5-4 in the final set to defeat fifth seed Zheng Qin­wen of China, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5.
World number 27 Kost­yuk will face US Open champion Coco Gauff for a place in the semi-finals.
Elena Rybakina beat Veronika Kudermetova 7-6 (7-3), 1-6, 6-4, continuing her strong form in 2024.
The Kazakh world number four, who has already claimed titles at Brisbane and Abu Dhabi this year, beat the Russian in two hours 33 minutes.
“I know I have my weapon, my serve. I know I can always serve it out in tough moments. Not alw­ays, but this is a strength,” Rybakina said.
Rybakina will be playing in her seventh quarter-final of the season on Friday where she will face Jasmine Paolini who put out Ons Jabeur 7-6 (10-8), 6-4.
Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova defe­a­ted Anastasia Potapova 7-6 (7-5), 6-1 in her last 16 clash.

Then, the National Women’s Championship was postponed due to academic exams of the players.
Holding domestic competitions after a long gap, the Pakistan Football Federation Norma­lisation Committee is facing several obstacles even if it held the draw for the fifth phase of the National Futsal Cup in Karachi.
The PFF NC announced on Friday that it was indefinitely shelving plans to hold the National Women’s Championship, which was set to kick off in Karachi from May 5.
“This decision comes in response to feedback from representatives of various clubs, who expressed concerns regarding potential clashes between the championship schedule and the academic commitments of their players,” it said in a statement.
“In light of these considerations, the PFF has made the difficult but necessary decision to 
postpone the event. However, the revised schedule for the National Women’s Football Championship 2024 will be announced in due course, following further consultation with club representatives and careful consideration of all relevant factors.”
In a letter sent to the teams, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the PFF NC noted that it “had received numerous requests from teams regarding clashes between the scheduled dates of the Championship and important O/A Levels examinations among others”.
It added it realises the “challenges they [examinations] pose for participating teams”.
The PFF has already stated that only club sides from the country will be allowed to take part in the women’s championship, meaning departmental teams like defending champions Pakistan Army, who won the title when the event was last held in its entirety in 2020, would not be able to take part.
The decision to postpone the women’s championship came a day after the PFF NC admitted it was looking for another venue, with Islamabad’s Jinnah Stadium its preferred 
choice, due to the unavailability of Lahore’s Punjab Stadium for the knockout stages of the Challenge Cup.
The group stages of the Challenge Cup, the premier cup tournament for men’s teams, was held last year and the PFF NC had announced that the concluding part of the tournament will take place from May 1 to 12.
