• Met Office predicts more downpour
QUETTA: The road link to many areas of Balochistan couldn’t be restored till Friday as rains and thunderstorms continued in different areas of northern and southern Balochistan during the last 24 hours.
The border district of Chaman continued to witness disaster as flash floods entered the town from Khozak and other mountain ranges.
The deluge also damaged the Quetta-Chaman highway, cutting off traffic between the two cities.
Trucks carrying Afghan Transit Trade goods were stuck near Qila Abdullah and Chaman, and they are waiting for the road to be cleared.
Officials in Chaman said Levies and other forces had reached the people stranded in hilly areas and “are making all-out efforts” to restore traffic on the highway.
They added that the bodies of a woman and a child were recovered from a seasonal stream.
They died after the vehicle they were travelling in was swept away in flash floods as the driver tried to cross a gushing seasonal stream.
“The bodies were handed over to the family,” the official added.
The provincial capital, Quetta, didn’t receive any rainfall during the last 12 hours , but overnight heavy rain damaged mud houses on the city’s outskirts.
Water was yet to be drained from some areas of the city as drains failed to evacuate the water due to blockages.
Some parts of the Makran region were still cut off from Karachi as a key bridge in the Basool area of Ormara, on the Makran Coastal Highway, had been washed away by flash floods.
All traffic has been suspended as an alternative route was yet to be constructed.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said a team headed by its chairman, Aurangzeb Khan, visited Daak and Mal in Noshki district, which were badly affected by the downpour.
Hundreds of people who were rendered homeless during the inclement weather were given tents, food and drinking water, the PDMA said.
Meanwhile, the Meteorological Centre of Balochistan has advised the authorities to remain vigilant during the next 48 hours.
It has forecast more rain with thunderstorm in Quetta, Ziarat, Chaman, Pishin, Qila Saifullah, Chaman, Qila Abdullah, Mastung, Sherani, Zhob, Musakhail Barkhan, Khuzdar, Kalat, Noshki, Sibi, Kohlu, Dera Bugti, Loralai and Harnai in next 24 hours.
During the last 24 hours, the weather remained cloudy and it rained in most parts of the province.
The highest rainfall was recorded in Samungli at 25mm, Kalat 23mm, Dalbandin 21mm, Barkhan 16mm, Zhob13 mm and Panjgur 5mm.
More than 20 people have died and 15 injured due to roof collapses, lightning strikes and other mishaps since heavy rain and thunderstorms started in the province last week.
The situation is grim in Chaman, where a large number of mud houses were swept away by flash floods on Thursday triggered by heavy rainfall on surrounding mountains, Deputy Commissioner Atha Abbas Raja had told Dawn over the phone.
He said gushing water has also badly damaged roads, cutting Chaman off from other areas of Balochistan and suspending transit trade with Afghanistan.

During a meeting chaired by the PM on smuggling, a committee rep­ort was presented, according to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). “The committee identified the elements involved in the misuse of Afghan Transit Trade for smuggling and the officers facilitating them,” the report stated.
The PM was informed that a list of smugglers, hoarders, and their facilitating officers had be­en forwarded to law enforcement agencies and provincial governments. 
Consequently, the PM directed the removal of the identified officers from their respective posts and the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against them. 

Shehbaz orders removal of officers found involved, accelerating anti-smuggling drive

During the meeting, the prime minister paid tribute to Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir for his full cooperation with the government in its endeavour against smuggling. 
The report of the investigation committee, headed by A.D. Khawaja, was presented at the meeting. 
Calling for punishment to smugglers and drug dealers, the prime minister asked the law ministry to carry out legislation immediately for this purpose.
The PM emphasised more effective and swift monitoring of the sale and smuggling of Afghan Transit Trade goods in the country, calling for a third-party audit of the monitoring system.

3,FO slams Israel for international law violation,"Urges UN Security Council to intervene, hold Israel accountable.","ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Friday sharply criticised Israel for its flagrant violations of international law and urged the UN Security Council to intervene, hold Israel accountable, and assist in restoring global peace and security.
“Instead of showing restraint and upholding international law, Israel has brazenly continued with its blatant violation of international law,” said FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch when she was asked at the weekly media briefing to comment on the reports of Israel executing strikes against Iran.
Media reports earlier quoted US and Israeli officials claiming that Israel had carried out “missile and drone strikes” targeting Isfahan and Tabriz.
While avoiding directly commenting on those reports, the FO spokesperson said the situation was still being assessed. “We would comment when there are more details,” she added.
However, she reiterated Pakis­tan’s concern over the escalation in the region.
With Tehran, which retaliated following an airstrike on its consulate in Damascus, downplaying the attack being claimed by Israel, it appears that its restrained response may have temporarily averted the risk of a regional war for now.
Besides echoing global calls for de-escalation between Israel and Iran, including those from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and a joint G7 communique, Ms Baloch also highlighted the need for urgent international efforts to prevent the expansion of hostilities in the region and to secure a ceasefire in Gaza.
She repeated Islamabad’s criticism of Israel’s attack on Iranian consulate in Damascus, terming it “irresponsible and reckless” action that further vitiated security in an already volatile region. “We reiterate our call on the UN Security Council to prevent Israel from its adventurism in the region and to hold it to account for its violations of international law. The council should actively contribute to efforts for restoring and maintaining international peace and security,” the spokesperson said.
‘Deep disappointment’
The FO spokesperson expressed Pakistan government’s “deep disappointment” after the US vetoed a resolution that would have granted full UN membership to Palestine. “We regret the US decision to veto the draft resolution granting full membership of the UN to Palestine,” she said.
She said: “The people of Palestine have an inherent right to live in a sovereign, independent, and contiguous state within the borders of June 4, 1967, with Al-Quds Al-Shareef as its capital.”
