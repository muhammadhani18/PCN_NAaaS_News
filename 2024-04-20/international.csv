0,Absence of storm water drainage worsens Dubai’s flooding woes,"Impassable roads have affected basic services, with supermarkets unable to restock and many employees struggling to reach their workplaces.","DUBAI: When record downpours sent water flooding into his Dubai home, Riaz Haq expected the levels to drop once it stopped raining. But instead of falling, the water kept rising higher.
“We went to bed, the water was half-a-metre,” the British lawyer said, recalling Tuesday’s tempest that flooded homes, malls, offices and roads.
“We woke up and it was one metre. My cars were submerged, water to our waist. Everything is ruined.” Haq, his wife and their dog spent more than two days trapped on the upper floor of their two-storey home before they were finally rescued by a neighbour’s boat on Thursday.
The couple, who were only able to salvage some bread and snacks, did not eat for most of that time, surviving on a few bottles of water.
“Fridge, freezer, even my car was floating. Ever­ything was floating,” he said. 
“I had a brand new car. It’s all ruined.  It’s a natural disaster situation. No one was prepared for this level of carnage,” he added.
During their ordeal Haq, his wife and their neighbours —  about 18 families in a suburban residential community — were too scared to wade out through the waist-high, smelly water, fearing electrocution.
`Water is locked in’ 
The failure of water to drain away has proved a major obstacle to recovery efforts in the desert country, with persistent flooding blocking roads around Dubai days later.
Impassable roads have affected basic services, with supermarkets unable to restock and many employees struggling to reach their workplaces.
Dubai’s airport, the world’s busiest for international passengers, has suffered badly from staff shortages. Karim Elgendy, associate director at the Buro Happold engineering consultancy, said drainage for storm water had not been widely included in planning for the city.
“Someone must have vetoed this because of the fact that it hardly rains.
This conversation, I think, when it happened, was short,” he said.
“Water is locked in. If you have a hard surface like the road or the airport, where will it go? The ground is too hard (to absorb water),” Elgendy added.

1,New Yorkers find vetting for Trump jury slots stressful,NEW YORK: The judge in Donald Trump’s criminal trial hoped to wrap up jury selection on Saturday before opening...,"NEW YORK: The judge in Donald Trump’s criminal trial hoped to wrap up jury selection on Saturday before opening arguments start next week in the historic case against the former president.
The main 12 jurors were sworn in on Thursday, but a pool of six alternates still needs to be completed _ ready to step in if any of the original jury become unavailable during the case in which Trump is accused of covering up hush money paid to a porn star.
The difficulty of choosing jurors who will be impartial when judging one of the most controversial men in the country — and also able to set aside as much as two months of their time — has been clear throughout the selection process this week. Two women in the pool of dozens of ordinary New Yorkers being vetted for the final jury slots on Friday burst into tears as they answered probing questions from attorneys.
“I’m sorry. I thought I could do this,” said one who was quickly released by judge Juan Merchan. “This is so much more stressful than I thought it was going to be.” 
Trump arrived in court and delivered an angry statement about what he called the “very unfair” partial gag order imposed by Merchan to prevent him from using his powerful media presence to attack witnesses, prosecutors and relatives of court staff. “The judge has to take off this gag order,” said Trump, who has a long history, including while president, of making threatening or insulting statements against private and public opponents.

2,US vetoes resolution  on UN membership  for Palestinian state,UNITED NATIONS: The United States on Thursday effectively stopped the United Nations from recognising a Palestinian...,"UNITED NATIONS: The United States on Thursday effectively stopped the United Nations from recognising a Palestinian state by casting a veto in the Security Council to deny Palestinians full membership of the world body.
It vetoed a draft resolution that recommended to the 193-member UN General Assembly that “the State of Palestine be admitted to membership” of the UN. 
Britain and Switzerland abstained, while the remaining 12 council members voted yes.
“The United States continues to strongly support a two-state solution. This vote does not reflect opposition to Palestinian statehood, but instead is an acknowledgement that it will only come from direct negotiations between the parties,” Deputy US Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood told the council.
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas condemned the US veto in a statement as “unfair, unethical, and unjustified”.  Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour, at times emotional, told the council after the vote: “The fact that this resolution did not pass will not break our will and it will not defeat our determination. We will not stop in our effort.” 
The Palestinian push for full UN membership came six months since the Gaza crisis unfolded and as Israel is expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank, which the UN considers to be illegal.
‘Start with Gaza’  
The Palestinians are currently a non-member observer state, a de facto recognition of statehood that was granted by the UN General Assembly in 2012. But an application to become a full UN member needs to be approved by the Security Council and then at least two-thirds of the General Assembly.
“We believe that such recognition of Palestinian statehood should not come at the start of a new process, but it doesn’t have to be at the very end of the process. We must start with fixing the immediate crisis in Gaza,” Britain’s UN Ambassador Barbara Woodward told the council.
The UN Security Council has long endorsed a vision of two states living side by side within secure and recognised borders. Palestinians want a state in occupied West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip, all territory captured by Israel in 1967.
Algeria’s UN Ambassador Amar Bendjama argued before the vote that admitting Palestinians to the United Nations would strengthen rather than undermine the two-state solution, adding: “Peace will come from Palestine’s inclusion, not from its exclusion.” 
The Palestinian Authority, headed by Mahmud Abbas, exercises limited self-rule in West Bank. Hamas ousted the Palestinian Authority from power in Gaza in 2007.
Hamas condemned the US stance in a statement and called on the international community to “support the struggle of our Palestinian people and their legitimate right to determine their destiny”.

3,China unveils new cyber force,"The new cyber force represents “a strategic step to establish a new system of services and arms and improve modern military force structure”, says defence ministry spokesperson.","BEIJING: China announced the creation of a new military cyber corps on Friday, saying it would bolster Beijing’s capacity to “fight and win” wars.
The Information Support Force will act as a “key support for coordinated development and application of network information systems”, defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian said.
China has ploughed billions of dollars into modernising its armed forces in recent years as tensions with the United States and other regional powers have escalated.
President Xi Jinping has also sought to bring the military more firmly under his control.
The new cyber force represents “a strategic step to establish a new system of services and arms and improve (China’s) modern military force structure”, Wu said.

4,‘Tortured poet’ Taylor Swift exorcises demons with second album,The 34-year-old has been crossing music industry milestones and boosting local economies with her record-breaking Eras Tour.,"LOS ANGELES: Taylor Swift surprised fans with her new record The Tortured Poets Department on Friday, revealing it was a double album featuring songs about heartbreak and a period described as “the saddest story” of the singer’s life.
Swift’s 11th studio album, featuring 16 tracks, was released at midnight and two hours later she revealed a second instalment with 15 more songs.
“I’d written so much tortured poetry in the past 2 years and wanted to share it all with you,” Swift wrote on Instagram.
“Poets” comes 18 months after 2022’s Midnights. Swift will also release a video for the new album’s first single, a collaboration with Post Malone called Fortnight.
The 34-year-old has been crossing music industry milestones and boosting local economies with her record-breaking Eras Tour, which resumes in Paris next month.
Time magazine named Swift its 2023 Person of the Year, citing her musical accomplishments and influence on everything from pop culture to voter registration.
A description of Poets on Instagram said it was “an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time _ one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure”.
“This period of the author’s life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up,” it added.
“There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed. And upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted.”
The post also suggested that Swift used the writing process to heal.
“This writer is of the firm belief that our tears become holy in the form of ink on a page. Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it,” it said.
The Instagram post did not say which events Swift was referring to. Fans have speculated she was writing about her relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn. The pair split in April last year after six years of dating.
 
 

A representative for Alwyn could not immediately be reached for comment.
Reviews of Poets were mostly positive, with Rolling Stone calling the music “wildly ambitious and gloriously chaotic”.
Billboard said the album was “extreme in its emotions and uninterested in traditional hits; not everyone will love it, but the ones who get it will adore it fiercely”.
Other critics were not as impressed. Britain’s NME described it as “surprisingly flat and, at times, cringeworthy”.
Lindsay Zoladz of the New York Times praised several tracks, but said the best ones may be obscured by the volume of new songs.
“Great poets know how to condense, or at least how to edit,” Zoladz said, adding that the album’s sharpest moments “would be even more piercing in the absence of excess”.

5,"Apple pulls WhatsApp, Threads from store after Beijing order","Other Meta apps, including Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, remain available to download.","BEIJING: Apple said on Friday it had removed Meta Platforms’ WhatsApp and Threads from its App Store in China after being ordered to do so by the Chinese government, which cited national security concerns.
Telegram and Signal — two other foreign messaging apps — were also removed from the store on Friday, according to app tracking firms Qimai and AppMagic.
The removal of the four apps suggests growing intolerance on the part of China’s central government towards at least some foreign online messaging services that fall outside of its control. It also signals less leeway for Apple in China.
However, other Meta apps, including Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, remained available to download, according to Reuters checks on Friday. Many other popular apps developed by Western companies, including YouTube and X (formerly Twitter), were also available.
It was not immediately clear how WhatsApp or Threads might have caused security concerns for Chinese authorities.
“The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,” Apple said in an emailed statement.
“We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree,” the statement said.
Meta declined to comment and referred queries to Apple. Apple did not respond to requests for comment on Signal and Telegram. Representatives for the two companies did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

6,"US sanctions Israeli minister’s ally, fundraisers for settlers",WASHINGTON: The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on an ally of Israel’s far-right national security...,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on an ally of Israel’s far-right national security minister and two entities that raised money for men accused of settler violence, the latest actions aimed against those Washington blames for an escalation of violence in the occupied West Bank.
The sanctions, in addition to those already imposed on five settlers and two unauthorised outposts already this year, are the latest sign of growing US frustration with the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The moves on Friday, which freeze any US assets held by those targeted and generally bar Americans from dealing with them, hit two organisations that launched fundraising campaigns to support settlers accused of violence and targeted by previous sanctions, the Treasury said in a statement.
The Biden administration’s moves against Israeli settlers have upset right-wing members of Netanyahu’s governing coalition who support the expansion of Jewish settlements and ultimately the annexation of the West Bank, where Palestinians envisage a future state.
They come as the complex relationship between Washington and Tel Aviv is tested by the Gaza crisis and as the Biden administration urges Israel to show restraint in responding to retaliatory strikes by Iran.
Washington sanctioned Ben-Zion Gopstein, founder and leader of the right-wing group Lehava, which opposes Jewish assimilation with non-Jews.
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said members of the group had engaged in “destabilising violence affecting the West Bank”.  
“Under Gopstein’s leadership, Lehava and its members have been involved in acts or threats of violence against Palestinians, often targeting sensitive or volatile areas,” Miller said in a statement, warning of additional steps if Israel does not take measures to prevent extremist attacks amid an escalation of violence in the occupied territory in recent days.
The European Union said on Friday it had agreed to impose sanctions against Lehava and other groups linked to violent settlers.
