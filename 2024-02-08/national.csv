0,Sindh opposes rushed approval of Rs1.1tr canal network package,Tensions rise over concerns on water shares as Centre pushes controversial proposal,"Sindh, on Wednesday, opposed a highly questionable and sudden joint move by the federal government and the Water and Power Development Authority to secure approval for a roughly Rs1.1 trillion development package for constructing canal networks.
The development unfolded during a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC), according to officials of the Planning Ministry.
Wapda presented the Master Plan for the Rs1.1 trillion Canals Network package at the ECNEC meeting without first securing the requisite endorsements from the Planning Commission and the Water Resources Ministry. Wapda was backed by ECNEC Chairperson Dr Shamshad Akhtar.
Attendees of the meeting told The Express Tribune that the package included construction of more than half a dozen canals, some of which were highly controversial, such as the Greater Thal Canal.
Sindh has long opposed the construction of some of these canals due to their adverse impact on the province’s water share. Some of these projects included in the package had separate approvals, but Wapda bundled them with those not yet approved by all competent forums.
ECNEC members were largely uninformed when Wapda introduced the proposal, backed by Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar, according to a cabinet member. In response, Sindh Revenue Minister Younus Dagha opposed the proposal, particularly objecting to the Greater Thal Canal project.
Dagha’s main objection was to the Greater Thal Canal project, said sources.
Wapda’s proposal also violated the commitment given to the International Monetary Fund and an Act of Parliament that requires thorough scrutiny of such proposals, said a senior planning ministry official.
During the meeting, the planning minister and planning secretary did not object to violations committed by Wapda. Sources said that at one point, the finance minister stated that she would conditionally approve the master plan.
The reasons for expediting ECNEC proceedings were unclear, especially as the interim government planned another ECNEC meeting next week after the general elections.

A late-night press release by the finance ministry stated that “the summary of Ministry of Planning Development and Special Initiatives regarding Development of National Irrigation Network for Green Pakistan Initiative was discussed in detail with the submission to Ministry of Water Resources and Provinces to allocate priority to strategic canals in accordance with National Water Policy”.
The finance ministry further stated that “Greater Thal Canal Project (Phase II) was also discussed, on which the government of Sindh showed its concerns”.
The ECNEC directed the government of Sindh to present its views regarding techno-economic viability of the Greater Thal Canal (Phase II) project to the Council of Common Interest. “The forum gave approval of the Greater Thal Canal (Phase II) project, subject to approval of the CCI,” the finance ministry added.
The ECNEC approved increasing the cost of ongoing projects funded through the Public Sector Development Programme by 6% to compensate contractors against inflation. The 6% increase will dent the budget by Rs168 billion, despite approved projects already having the option to make adjustments against inflationary pressures.
The ECNEC was told that after a series of meetings, it has been recommended that the price adjustment formula will be applied on a case-to-case basis, with a financial impact of at least Rs168 billion.
The Constructors Association of Pakistan (CAP) and Association of Consulting Engineers Pakistan (ACEP) complained about the unprecedented inflation and recession of the economy in the country, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak since January 2020.
They claimed that this unprecedented situation has crippled construction activities in the country and cast negative effects on the Engineering Consultancy Sector. The Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) notified its document on September 19, 2022, to address the price adjustment in ongoing contracts, August-2022 due to an unprecedented price hike.

1,"Hesco, Gepco privatisation okayed",CCoP increases Privatisation Commission budget by Rs2.2b or 175%,"The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) on Wednesday approved handing over the management control of the two loss-making power distribution companies to the private sector aimed at stemming their losses and improving efficiency.
Headed by Privatisation Minister Fawad Hasan Fawad, the CCoP also approved revising the budget of the Privatisation Commission, jacking it up by 175% or Rs2.2 billion. The Commission’s budget has increased phenomenally during the course of the fiscal year to make room for the majority of the $14.53 million or Rs4.3 billion payments to the financial advisors hired for the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines and remodelling of the Roosevelt Hotel, New York.
The financial advisor of PIA will get a total of $6.9 million or Rs2 billion, and out of this, 95% or Rs1.9 billion will be paid during the current fiscal year, the CCOP was informed. Similarly, the financial advisor of the Roosevelt Hotel would get a record $7.65 million or Rs2.2 billion, and 60% of this payment will be made during the current fiscal year. These are probably the highest payments made to any financial advisor hired by the Privatisation Commission.
For the current fiscal year, the government had approved a Rs1.3 billion budget for the Privatisation Commission, which the CCoP has now revised to Rs3.4 billion – an increase of Rs2.2 billion or 175%. The additional room was created to make payments to PIA advisor Ernst & Young and Roosevelt Hotel Advisor is Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL) – a Chicago-based real estate management firm.
The privatisation ministry has used the Rs290 to a dollar exchange rate for the budget purposes for making the $14.53 million payments to these advisors. But the financial advisors will be paid in dollar terms.
The CCoP decided to give the Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO) and the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) on a 20 to 25 years lease contract, according to at least two cabinet ministers.
The decision was taken on a summary moved by the Ministry of Energy and it also has the backing of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).
However, it was also decided that both these power distribution companies along with eight others will remain on the active Privatisation Programme. The CCoP also approved to end the earlier process of handing over these entities to the provinces.
The privatisation minister has in the past stated that the transfer of ownership of the power sector to the provinces cannot be described as privatisation.
The Ministry of Privatisation has not issued a press statement after the CCoP meeting.
Both the power distribution companies are running in losses. The annual State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) report showed that the GEPCO caused a loss of Rs20.6 billion while the losses incurred by the HESCO amounted to Rs54.4 billion in the fiscal year 2022.
The CCoP did not pick the highest loss-making entity – Peshawar Electricity Supply Company – which caused Rs103 billion losses in 2022 – even more than the losses of PIA.
The CCoP did not accept the Ministry of Energy’s proposal to give a lead role to the Power Division in handling the outsourcing process. The CCoP also did not agree to setting up an inter-ministerial committee to give the two entities on lease.
The Power Division’s proposal to appoint the International Finance Corporation (IFC) – an arm of the World Bank – as the financial advisor was also not accepted by the CCoP at this stage.
The privatisation ministry had supported the proposal of selecting one better-performing and one worse-performing power distribution company. The privatisation ministry has not supported delisting the Discos from the privatisation programme; however, the proposal of withdrawing the summary for provincialisation of Discos has been supported.
There has been less focus on the privatisation of the power sector, which caused Rs376 billion losses out of the Rs730 billion combined losses by all the government-owned companies.
The CCoP did not approve another summary for the transfer of the 10% shares of Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) back to the Petroleum Division. These shares currently rest with the Privatisation Commission.
Earlier, the Privatisation Commission Board had referred the decision for the transfer of 10% shares of the OGDCL in the name of the Petroleum Division to the CCoP. The Privatisation Commission has been receiving dividends of the 10% shares, which it then remits to the finance division.
The CCoP decided that for the time being, these shares should stay with the Privatisation Commission. Eventually, these 10% shares along with the entire 85% government shareholding in the OGDCL would be transferred to the Sovereign Wealth Fund, according to the government officials.
Seven profitable companies have been placed in the Sovereign Wealth Fund, and their earnings will be used to make future investments in various ventures, they added.

3,Govt to extend scope of talks with IPPs to cut tariff,"Decides to negotiate with hydel, gas-based IPPs to save costs for consumers","As electricity prices continue to surge, the government has decided to extend the scope of negotiations with independent power plants (IPPs) to cover hydel and gas-based projects as well in an effort to slash tariffs.
Earlier, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government had started negotiations with the IPPs to review the dollar indexation clause. A cap was placed to control the electricity prices rising with further depreciation of the rupee.
The current caretaker government has continued negotiations with wind energy producers. Now, it has decided to talk to hydel and gas-based IPPs as well.
It directed the Power Division in a recent meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCOE) to come up with a separate summary.
The cabinet body told the Power Division to initiate a separate case for engaging with the remaining IPPs, including those dealing with hydel power that did not sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU).
During discussions, according to sources, CCOE members noted that the scope of negotiations should not be restricted to wind or bagasse-based power plants but hydel and gas-fired IPPs may also be included.
They observed that since the summary carried a proposal for extending the scope to the remaining bagasse-based plants, therefore, a separate summary would be required rather than adding hydel and other IPPs to the existing summary. The CCOE agreed to the proposal.
The energy committee was informed that the Power Division had submitted a summary titled “Implementation of Master Agreements and PPA amendments with Wind Power Producers” on May 25, 2023. The CCOE considered the summary and directed the Power Division to chalk out a new strategy to continue to engage with 14 wind power producers to achieve savings for consumers and reduce costs.

To comply with the CCOE directive, the Power Division notified a committee to negotiate with the wind energy producers.
The Power Division said that Chiniot Power Limited, an IPP run on bagasse, did not agree during earlier negotiations to convert its MoU into a binding agreement in financial year 2020-21.
However, the IPP has now shown its intention to renegotiate and initiate meaningful discussions with the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guarantee (CPPA-G) to resolve its disputes.
Earlier, MoUs were signed with 47 IPPs in the wake of negotiations during 2020. Later, an implementation committee succeeded in converting 46 MoUs into initial agreements for CCOE’s approval.
Of the 46 IPPs, binding agreements were reached with 32 IPPs and payments were made after taking approval of the CCOE and the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC).
The CCOE authorised the Power Division to devise a new strategy to continue its engagements with 14 wind power producers. The Power Division was of the view that the committee constituted for talks with the wind energy producers could also engage in negotiations with Chiniot Power to evaluate the company’s proposal and place recommendations before the CCOE.
It said that the committee may recommend possible options while keeping proposals non-discriminatory for other bagasse-based IPPs.

4,Rupee ticks up to 3-1/2-month high,"With fresh uptick, currency has cumulatively risen 9.93%, or Rs27.76, in past five months","Pakistani currency on Wednesday hit three-and-a-half-month high at Rs279.34 against the US dollar in the interbank market, maintaining its winning streak for the second consecutive day apparently in the wake of higher inflows of foreign currency. 
According to SBP data, the rupee appreciated 0.03%, or Rs0.08, on a day-on-day basis. With the fresh uptick, the currency has cumulatively risen 9.93%, or Rs27.76, in the past five months.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan reported that the rupee went up 0.03%, or Rs0.08, closing at Rs281.05/$ in the open market.
The currency has maintained its uptrend after the credit rating agency, S&P Global, hinted at upgrading Pakistan’s rating to “B” following the formation of a new government post-Thursday’s elections, subject to the economic roadmap to be followed by the new rulers.
There are strong reports in the market that the new government, irrespective of whoever comes to power, will immediately engage in talks with the IMF to secure a new bailout package, as the ongoing loan programme of $3 billion is going to end in March this year.

5,Stocks rise in volatile trading ahead of polls,"KSE-100 index gains 344.85 points, settles at 64,143.87","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) succeeded on Wednesday in maintaining its positive momentum as investors appeared optimistic about the economic and political scenario after general elections.
However, the KSE-100 index faced increased volatility despite expectations of credit rating upgrade for Pakistan post-elections, driven by a new economic roadmap.
The trading session commenced on a positive note but soon volatility gripped the bourse and the index fluctuated between green and red zones throughout the day.
The market touched its intra-day low at 63,927.28 just before midday but rebounded later to hit the intra-day high at 64,196.61 towards the close of trading, influenced by efforts to secure a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan deal after polls. The bourse closed the day above the 64,000 mark.
“Stocks closed higher in a pre-election rally amid speculation about S&P Global’s projection of ratings upgrade to “B” on expectations of adoption of tough reforms by the new government for an IMF deal, and falling treasury bond yields,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“An upbeat economic outlook, strong earnings in oil and banking sectors and the government’s resolve to resolve the circular debt issue played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 344.85 points, or 0.54%, and settled at 64,143.87.
Topline Securities, in its commentary, wrote that investors at the stock market were optimistic ahead of general elections.
“This positive movement was fueled by Hub Power, Meezan Bank, Engro Fertilisers, United Bank and Bank Alfalah, which collectively contributed 197 points to the index,” Topline said.
Latest PSX faces volatility amid political uncertainty
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, commented that in the last trading session ahead of general elections, the market regained the 64,000 mark.
“The convergence of price action will likely be resolved on Friday following election results where the stronger the government will be, the more positively the market will likely react,” it said.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal noted that the stock market traded in the positive territory, albeit with lacklustre investor participation throughout the day.
“We believe that investors opted to stay away before general elections scheduled for Thursday,” he said, adding “going forward, investors are recommended to adopt a cautious approach and follow a buy-on-dips strategy in banking and exploration and production sectors.”
Overall trading volumes decreased to 327.6 million shares against Tuesday’s tally of 330.9 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs14.3 billion.
Shares of 356 companies were traded. Of these, 203 stocks closed higher, 125 dropped and 28 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 44.4 million shares, gaining Rs0.11 to close at Rs4.86. It was followed by Oil and Gas Development Company with 24.95 million shares, losing Rs4.9 to close at Rs150.67 and Pak Elektron with 21.3 million shares, gaining Rs0.81 to close at Rs23.88.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs395.2 million, according to the NCCPL.

7,Govt raises 7.5 times lower financing at T-bills auction,Strategy aims to maintain policy rate amidst IMF concerns,"The government has raised financing 7.5 times lower than the target, reaching Rs64 billion through the auctioning of sovereign debt securities (T-bills), while managing to stabilise the rate of return at around 20.4%.
Commercial banks demanded a significantly higher rate of return (interest rate) to lend money to the cash-strapped government. This was prompted by concerns that the central bank might raise the policy rate to a new record high level following recommendations from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to maintain a tight monetary policy to tackle future challenges.
However, the government only managed to raise Rs64 billion against the target of Rs480 billion. This strategy helped in maintaining the cut-off yield (interest rate) at stable levels, indicating to the market that there is currently no consideration to increase the policy rate in the near future.
Commercial banks had offered Rs1.15 trillion in financing at the T-bills auction held on Tuesday.
The central bank has maintained the policy rate at a record high of 22% since late June 2023 despite announcing four monetary policies in the past seven months. State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmad stated that the IMF has recommended only maintaining a tight monetary policy but did not suggest what the policy rate should be. He mentioned, “The current policy rate remains appropriate to control the inflation reading.”
Market experts believe the policy rate has peaked at 22%. They anticipate the central bank will make its first rate cut in March 2024. While speaking to The Express Tribune, Optimus Capital Management’s Research Analyst, Maaz Azam, mentioned that the government raised lower financing due to commercial banks’ demand for higher interest rates. However, it is expected that borrowing will increase in the next auction when low inflation rates may allow banks to charge a lower rate of return.
Read Govt borrows Rs599b via T-bills auction
Azam predicted that the market would witness a sharp drop in inflation to 24-24.5% in February compared to around 28.3% in January. Further declines to 20-21% are expected by March 2024. This reduction in inflation may prompt the central bank to cut its benchmark policy rate in February or March 2024.
Previously, the central bank had increased the policy rate cumulatively by 15 percentage points from September 2021 to June 2023, raising it to 22%.
Azam explained that the government borrowed an additional Rs300-350 billion through the auctioning of Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), meeting its immediate financing requirement to repay maturing domestic debt on Tuesday.
The bank borrowed the higher financing by selling PIBs at a variable rate of return, which would move along with the policy rate. The rate of return on the PIBs would also decrease when the central bank cuts the policy rate in the near future, helping the government manage the rate of return at an affordable level.
The government sold the PIBs at a rate of the policy rate plus 1.4 percentage points, which currently stands at around 21.4%. However, the rate of return is expected to decrease as the market foresees the policy rate declining by 7 percentage points by the end of December 2024, from 22% to 15% at present. Azam stated that the government also borrowed less in anticipation of the new IMF loan programme expected after March 2024, aiming to reduce its reliance on expensive domestic debt.

8,UAE fund plans $4-5b investments in India,Funds will go through a tax-neutral finance hub in Gujarat,"Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the largest sovereign wealth fund in the UAE, is setting up a $4-5 billion fund to invest in India through a tax-neutral finance hub in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
The regulatory authority for financial services at Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, or GIFT City, has granted in-principle approval to ADIA to set up the fund, sources said, declining to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to media. ADIA’s intention to establish a presence in the hub was first announced last July in a joint statement, opens new tab by India and the UAE. The amount of investment planned and the approval from the regulatory authority has not been previously reported.
A spokesperson for ADIA declined comment. An email to the International Financial Services Authority (IFSCA), which regulates financial services in the hub, was not answered.
With the approval, ADIA will become the first sovereign wealth fund to begin investing in India via GIFT City. The greenlight comes days before Modi is set to visit Abu Dhabi to inaugurate a large temple. Since becoming prime minister a decade ago, Modi has visited the UAE six times, strengthening ties with India's third-largest trading partner.

9,Economic revival likely post-polls,"LSM sector growth, exchange rate improvement key to boosting economy","As Pakistan heads towards general elections, a ray of hope is emerging among the public and business community. Nearly every individual, no matter rich or poor, businessman or economist, job-seeker or job-holder, is pinning hopes on the upcoming government, believing it will be able to improve the economy and make a sizable reduction in inflation.
While it is premature to predict which party or group of political parties may form the next government, the economic revival agenda is on top of every political party’s manifesto.
One can argue against the tall claims of different parties and their policy mechanism, however, there is consensus among different stakeholders that until the rejuvenation of large-scale manufacturing (LSM) sector, it would be a distant dream to reduce unemployment, and it would be more difficult to control inflation, until the exchange rate improves, coupled with a reduction in the cost of energy.
“Businesses and industries are in a crisis, largely due to high cost of doing business and inflationary pressures,” said Syed Rizwan Haider, a public relations specialist.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Haider saw Pakistan as a country that was full of potential as it had ample manpower, natural and land resources, which could produce different commodities on a large scale.
“What a businessman wants is an enabling environment, which can be created through a stable, long-term policy, reduction in taxes and energy bills. If the government wants to increase power or gas tariffs, it can go for it, but it should exclude various taxes, which normally cost up to 50% of original bills,” he said.
“The not-so-enabling environment for doing business, coupled with import bans, has resulted in massive unemployment, causing further trouble for fresh graduates who prefer to fly abroad for better prospects, despite the fact that a large number of immigration-seekers do not have proper skills set to work in global economies.”
The International Labour Organisation (ILO), in its report, said that Pakistan’s employment-to-population ratio was estimated at 47.6% in 2023, which was nearly 2% below the pre-crisis ratio in 2019.
The estimated ‘jobs gap’ grew to 2.4 million in 2023 and the number of persons unemployed, not working and actively seeking work, was projected to reach 5.6 million for 2023. This translates into an increase of 1.5 million unemployed persons since 2001, and this estimate matches with the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) projected unemployment rate of 8.5% in 2023, up from 6.2% in 2021.
Lahore School of Economics’ Professor Dr Moazam Mahmood said that with projected economic growth of 2.4%, it was hard to create jobs for millions of Pakistanis in fiscal year 2023-24.

“Pakistan’s economy is highly import-dependent, especially large-scale manufacturing, as FY22 shows. A high growth rate averaging 6% requires imports of $90 billion.
“In FY23, imports dropped to $67 billion and in FY24 import constraints still appear to bite. Prior to that, in FY22, per-month imports topped $7 billion. In the first quarter of FY24, imports remained at $5.5 billion per month,” Mahmood said.
He added that inflation was another challenge hindering growth, which in 15 months from July 2022 to October 2023 was estimated at 29.39%.
“For FY24, the overwhelming driver of inflation has been the huge depreciation of the exchange rate, by some 37% as observed already over 1QFY24, contributing nearly two-thirds to the inflation rate.”
The second major driver of inflation has been the fiscal deficit, estimated at 6%. “The impact of increased energy prices on inflation, for this most recent period, comes in at 4.2%, a much larger part of this increase is based on additional taxation,” Mahmood elaborated.
“We expect the situation to get worse, but a long-term policy is the solution to achieve better economic growth and generate more employment opportunities.”
He emphasised Pakistan should now divide its economy into domestic economy and the balance of payments situation.
“We as a country now have to decide what to import, for the first five years, as we have to stop importing unnecessary consumer goods, and should opt for import substitution in this category. After a successful five-year ban, the policymakers should then move forward to ban some intermediary goods, at least for five more years, with the objective of locally produced replacements. And then comes the turn for capital goods,” he said.
Increased focus on LSM and agriculture sectors, of course, could put the economy back on track. “It may take many years to overhaul the economy, but we cannot sustain any more without making some fundamental changes, which could ultimately lead towards low inflation and higher job creation.”
