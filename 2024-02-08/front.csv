0,"Internet, cellular services outages cripple polls",Move attributed to maintaining ’law and order’; condemned by rights groups and parties,"Pakistan on Thursday witnessed a countrywide shutdown of internet and cellular phone services during the polling process with the authorities attributing the move ""to maintain law and order"" in the wake of the violence that occurred a day earlier.
However, the suspension was denounced by Amnesty International, which described it as a “reckless attack on people’s rights”, as well as experts and political stakeholders, particularly the PTI, a political party that relied heavily on social media platforms for its electoral campaign.
""It has been decided to temporarily suspend mobile services across the country,"" an interior ministry spokesman said in a statement.
The spokesman added that “precious lives have been lost” in recent militant attacks in the country and ""security measures are essential to maintain law and order situation and to deal with potential threats"".
Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja said the decision on mobile networks was made by ""law and order agencies"" following Wednesday's violence and the commission would not interfere.
In a post shared by the state-run broadcaster PTV on social media platform X, Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) spokesman Haroon Shinwari said the internet suspension would not affect the results of the polls and they would be announced on time.
He added that the ECP’s system was not linked to the internet.
The CEC also maintained that the ECP had its own exclusive independent networking system that did not require internet.
However, the suspension of the cellular services created hassles for the voters.
Voters in Pakistan were reliant on a text messaging service to confirm the polling station where they were registered.
Forty-year-old Abdul Jabbar said the internet disruption prevented him and his wife from finding their polling station.
NetBlocks, a global internet watchdog, said data confirmed there was a disruption to mobile phone and internet services ""corroborating widespread user reports of outages"".
""The ongoing election day internet blackout in Pakistan is amongst the largest we've observed in any country in terms of severity and extent,"" NetBlocks director Alp Toker told AFP.

""The practice is inherently undemocratic and is known to limit the work of independent election observers and cause irregularities in the voting process.""
Amnesty International slammed the suspension of internet and cellular services, calling it ""a blunt attack on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly"".
“It is reckless to impede access to information as people head out to polling stations on the heels of devastating bomb blasts and what has been an intense crackdown on the opposition in the lead up to the elections in the country,” Livia Saccardi, the interim deputy director for South Asia at Amnesty International, wrote in a post on X.
“Unwarranted restrictions on dissemination of information, despite reassurances to the contrary from the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority and Election Commission of Pakistan, are in breach of people’s human rights at this critical time in Pakistan,” Saccardi added.
Nighat Dad, a lawyer who runs the not-for-profit organisation Digital Rights Foundation, said the outage ""is an attack on the democratic rights of Pakistanis"".
""Shutting down mobile phone services is not a solution to national security concerns. If you shut down access to information you create more chaos. How do you call [anyone] if, God forbid, there is an attack?""
She added that there was more room for disinformation to spread, including about reports of unconfirmed attacks.
""People will of course put their safety first if they are unable to verify rumours of an attack in their area,"" she said, noting such disinformation could cause voters to stay away from the polls.
Senior PTI leader Senator Syed Ali Zafar has written a letter to the CEC, expressing concern over the suspension of internet and mobile phone services across the country on the day of the polls.
According to a statement issued by PTI’s Central Media Department, Zafar wrote in the letter that the nationwide suspension of mobile phone and internet services on the day of the elections had caused severe and significant damage to the country.
Barrister Ali Tahir, the Election Correspondence Cell of the PTI in Sindh in-charge, wrote to the CEC as well, claiming that the internet shutdown raised serious doubts about the ECP’s commitment to fulfilling its constitutional duties.
“The suspension of internet services on polling day represents a clear and brazen assault on democracy and the rule of law.”
The PTI in a post on X called on people to remove passwords from their personal Wifi accounts ""so anyone in the vicinity"" could have internet access.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari demanded that the caretaker government should restore the services.
In a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, PPP Central Election Cell In-charge Senator Taj Haider urged the top judge to “issue instructions” on the matter of internet services being suspended across the country.
He added that the internet suspension had affected voter turnout.
Haider informed the CJP that the interim government’s step was in violation of the Islamabad High Court’s 2018 order, which declared the suspension of cellular services on the pretext of “security concerns” as illegal.
“The closure has also adversely affected reporting and responding to security incidents. One of our workers was shot dead in Mirpurkhas today and it was after an hour that we came to know about the murder,” the letter read.
Haider also maintained that that “all political parties except the PML-N” have raised their reservations over the internet suspension
Jamaat-e-Islami Karachi chief and NA-250 candidate Hafiz Naeemur Rehman also expressed his concerns over the shutdown of cellular services.
In a video posted by the JI on X, the party’s Karachi chief condemned the suspension of mobile services, describing the move as a ‘shameful stunt”. He accused the interim government of paralysing the communication system on the day of the elections.
By the time the polling was over by 5pm, both the internet and cellular services were resumed partially in Islamabad as well as Rawalpindi. Subsequently, they were completely restored across the country.

1,Military hopes election will serve as catalyst for strengthening democracy,"Safe and secure environment for public was ensured through deployment of 137,000 army personnel, says ISPR","The armed forced of Pakistan have congratulated the nation on the “generally peaceful and violence-free” conduct of the general elections, and expressed the hope it would serve as a “catalyst for further strengthening democracy in Pakistan”.
“It is our fervent hope that our sacrifices would not be in vain and this election will serve as a catalyst for further strengthening democracy in Pakistan, and that it will pave the way for the realisation of the aspirations of the people of Pakistan,” the military’s media wing, the ISPR, said in a statement.
“The armed forces remain dedicated to upholding peace and security in the country and stand ready to provide unwavering support in safeguarding the democratic traditions of our state,” it stated.
The ISPR stated that the armed forces alongside other law enforcement agencies (LEAs) are proud to have played a pivotal role in providing security during the conduct of the sacred electoral process, in aid of civil power, and in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan.

A safe and secure environment for the public was ensured through the deployment of 137,000 army personnel and civil armed forces at approximately 6,000 selected “most sensitive” polling stations and over 7,800 QRFs, it added. “Gratitude is owed to other law enforcement agencies that worked hand in hand with the armed forces to safeguard the democratic process.”
According to the ISPR, despite 51 cowardly terrorist attacks, mostly in K-P and Balochistan, aimed at disrupting the electoral process, the soldiers remained resolute and effectively ensured peace and security across Pakistan.
Twelve people, including 10 personnel of security forces and law enforcement agencies, embraced shahadat and 39 others have been injured in these attacks, according to the ISPR. “Through proactive intelligence manoeuvres and swift action, many potential threats were neutralised, underscoring the unwavering commitment of our security agencies to protect the democratic rights of our citizens,” it added. “During various operations, five Terrorists were also killed.”

2,Naya or Purana Pakistan,Nation goes to polls to elect their representatives for next five years,"The curtain finally rises on the general elections as the nation prepares to go to the polls today. Despite delays and political hiccups, Pakistanis will now cast their votes, electing new national and provincial legislatures and ushering in a fresh constitutional journey.
The road to these elections has been riddled with challenges with echoes of the past haunting the present. The 2018 polls had seen PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif caught in the cross hairs. However, this time around, the PTI chief, Imran Khan, and his party are facing a crackdown.
The elections were earlier scheduled for November last year as the previous National Assembly was dissolved days before it could complete its term in August, 2023. However, unforeseen events threw out unexpected plot twists.
Soon after a caretaker government was sworn in, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) announced that it could not hold general elections in the 90-day constitutional timeframe as it would have to conduct fresh delimitation of constituencies in view of a digital census that the outgoing political government notified in the last week of its term.
The ECP later announced holding polls in the last week of January without specifying its exact date. However, the polls oversight authority had to announce the date of election in consultation with the president on November 3, 2023 only after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court later also removed some other legal hurdles to the general elections, which some forces including some political parties like JUI-wanted deferred to a later date for various reasons including inclement weather in the northern parts of the country and security issues.
Apparently, a restive political climate is the only thing that has remained unchanged between the two general elections.
In view of a highly polarized environment coupled with security challenges, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has deployed security forces to perform duties as defined in Article 245 (functions of Armed Forces) of the Constitution.
The police will be the first-tier responders, followed by the civil armed forces as the second tier, and the armed forces as the third tier. The armed forces are being deployed outside the most sensitive polling stations.
The role of the security forces has become all the more important after the recent surge in violent attacks targeting election candidates and political entities, especially in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provinces.
Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja recently admitted in an official statement that there are security challenges; that the law and order situation is deteriorating in two provinces, and the poll body’s offices as well as political meetings are being attacked just ahead of polls.
The CEC, having all the time to ensure free and fair elections and foolproof security arrangements, simply termed “terrorism as the biggest enemy of the electoral process”.
Parties and independents
In the political ring, heavyweight contenders like the PML-N, the PPP, the MQM-P, the JUI-F, the PML-Q, the TLP, the JI, the ANP as well as others regional and religious parties vie for victory.
For the general election 2024, the ECP has allocated election symbols to 150 political parties.

The PTI, though in the contest, faces unique challenges as the ECP deprived it of its iconic election symbol, the cricket bat, forcing its candidates to run as independents. This, the PTI leaders and experts say, can open the window for horse-trading post elections.
The Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) states that as many as 111 political parties have nominated 275 women candidates to contest the upcoming elections on general seats, making up 4.6 percent of the total of 6,037 candidates.
Voters and candidates
Nevertheless, over 128 million registered voters out of a total 241.4 million population would elect members for 266 National Assembly and 593 provincial assemblies’ seats.
Out of the total 128,585,760 voters, constituting over half of its total population, over 69 million (69,263,704) male and over 59 million (59,322,056) female voters of Islamabad, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan would put democracy to its latest test.
According to Fafen, this indicates an increase in the proportion of voters within the population, rising from 49.6 percent in 2018 to 53.2 percent in 2024.
Between the last two general elections, Fafen said, the number of registered voters increased by 27.4 percent, from 86,189,828 in 2013 to 106,000,239 in 2018. Since then, the number of registered voters has increased by 22 million (21.7%), reaching 128,585,760. These include 12.5 million women.
A staggering total of 5,121 candidates, including 4,807 males, 312 females, and two transgender individuals – representing a diverse spectrum of parties and ideologies – are vying for the 266 general seats in the National Assembly.
Simultaneously, 12,695 candidates, comprising 12,123 males, 570 females, and two transgender persons, are contesting the 593 general seats across the four provincial assemblies. Voting for both the national and the provincial assemblies will be held on the same day.
Polling stations and booths
The ECP has set up a total of 90,675 polling stations across the country including a total of 25,320 polling stations for men, 23,950 for women and 41,405 combined polling stations.
The ECP has established 50,944 polling stations in Punjab, out of which 14,556 will be for men, and 14,036 for women, while 22,352 polling stations will be for both men and women.
There will be 19,006 polling stations in Sindh, including 4,443 for men, 4,413 for women and 10,250 joint polling stations. Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa will have 15,697 polling stations, including 4,810 for male, and 4,286 for female voters. There will be 6,601 combined polling stations in K-P.
Balochistan will have 5,028 polling stations, including 1,511 for men, and 1,317 for women. The number of joint polling stations in the province is 2,200.
The ECP data shows that there will be 276,398 polling booths across the country, including 147,552 polling booths for men and 127,846 polling booths for women.
In total, there will be 149,434 polling booths in Punjab, 65,005 in Sindh, 47,077 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and 14,882 in Balochistan.
Young voters
Fafen states that the distribution of voters across age groups demonstrates that voters under the age of 35 constitute 44 percent of the total electorate.
Within the age brackets, the largest proportion of voters falls within the 26-35 range. In the younger category of 18-25, the proportion of voters is notably lower at 18 percent.
These figures may indicate a combination of factors such as under-registration and a decline in population growth rates over time.
Subsequently, the 36-45 age group comprises 22 percent of the registered voters. The 46-55 age category has 14 percent of voters, while a mere nine percent fall into the 56-65 age group. Lastly, individuals aged 65 and above account for 10 percent of voters.
Turnout and expected outcome
In the 2018 general elections, the turnout was 51 percent, meaning only half of the country’s voters came out to cast their votes. As admitted and explained by politicians and experts, no party is in a clear position to gain majority in the National Assembly, saying it can lead to a hung parliament, again.
The only thing that can change predictions, they say, is the turnout of the voters on the polling day.

3,Pakistan's electoral dilemma: hope amidst challenges,Imran Khan’s PTI faces an uphill battle in contested elections,"As Pakistan braces itself for the momentous day of highly contentious and controversial general elections, the nation stands at a critical juncture, marred by economic stagnation, hyperinflation, acute balance of payments issues, and serious security concerns.
In the midst of these challenges, the holding of elections today serves as a beacon of hope for continuity for the democratic process. Yet allegations about a lack of a level playing field, particularly for Imran Khan's PTI, have cast a shadow of doubt over the credibility of the exercise.
The PTI, having fallen out of favor with powerful quarters since the ouster of its government via a no-trust motion in April 2022, faces significant hurdles in this electoral battle. The perceived unfair advantages bestowed upon the PML-N this time underscore deeper issues within Pakistan's democratic framework, raising concerns about the integrity of the electoral process.
Restrictive conditions and constraints on political parties, notably the PTI, have hampered their ability to campaign freely, painting a picture of an uneven playing field exacerbated by the continuous influence of powerful quarters in the country's political affairs.
Surveys reflect a tight race between leading parties, the PTI and the PML-N, particularly in Punjab, which has a major say in government-making in the center. With its 141 general seats out of 266 directly elected seats of the National Assembly, alliances and political maneuvering in Punjab hold the key to dominance in the province that ultimately decides the fate of the next government at the center.
In this high-stakes electoral battle, parties like the PPP maintain their regional strongholds. While economic woes and security threats make the contest complicated, the presence of more than 100 parties in the contest with over 5,000 candidates for 266 National Assembly seats and another more than 12,000 candidates for 593 directly elected constituencies of the four provincial legislatures, add layers of complexity to the race. More than 65 percent of the candidates are independents.
The political landscape in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, historically a stronghold of the PTI, faces new challenges that may impact the party's performance. In Sindh, the PPP's influence remains strong, albeit with hurdles in expanding beyond its traditional base. Balochistan's political scene remains fragmented, with various parties and independents vying for influence in shaping the provincial government.
In a highly fragmented political atmosphere, voter turnout will determine the fate of main political players, particularly Imran Khan’s PTI, whose candidates are contesting as independents.
Many known PTI figures are either behind bars or facing crackdowns. Three court sentences to Imran Khan in three consecutive days just a week before the elections may go both in favor and against the party.
The party has been stripped of its election symbol, and candidates backed by the PTI are contesting as independents on numerous election symbols. It will be difficult for an electorate, 40% of whom cannot even read and write, to find their candidate if they have to vote for the PTI candidate.
Still, a lot would depend on the number of voters who turn up to cast their vote. Voters between 18-35 years of age constitute 44% of the 128 million voters and will play an important role in the elections.
Read: How elections can shape the future
A careful analysis of election results from the last four elections shows that the party poised to win an election got more seats than the proportionate number of votes it bagged on the polling day.
There were instances when the number of votes of a party was more than the number of votes of the “the king’s party” of that time. However, the king’s party ended up getting more seats thanks to the pre-poll, polling day, and post-poll maneuvers.
These maneuvers included seat adjustments, vote division through “manufactured” smaller parties and splinter groups, and smaller sectarian or religious groups launched to steer the results in favor of a particular party.
Interestingly, none of the mainstream parties that formed the government after the last four elections could secure more than 33% of the total votes cast, which leaves enough room in the hands of the establishment to maneuver.
If this maneuvering is not sufficient, another tactic is used when there is a very tight race. Rejected votes in a constituency, in many cases, are more than the difference between the winner and the runner-up. Interestingly, the percentage of rejected votes in every new election is increasing.
Besides other machinations done on election day to get a favorable outcome, the technology-based result compilation system of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has been seriously questioned during the last two elections.
In 2018, the ECP’s Result Transmission System (RTS) collapsed within a few hours after vote count started. For the 2024 elections, the ECP is introducing a new system, the Election Management System (EMS), developed by a private company to compile results electronically along with manual counting.
The ECP had its first large-scale mock test of the new system only a week ago—around two weeks before the polling day. It remains to be seen how successful the new system would prove in bringing transparency in vote count.
Despite these challenges, the unanimous decision of all stakeholders against boycotts or delays underscores a collective dedication to upholding democratic norms and a political transition of the nation's democratic journey.
