0,Police produce ‘missing’ Raja Nasir before IHC,Case dismissed after plea withdrawn by lawyer for PTI-backed candidate for PP-11,"On the strict instructions of the Islamabad High Court and its hint at postponing the general elections in case he was not found, police on Wednesday revealed the arrest of PTI-affiliated independent candidate for PP-11 Raja Nasir, the brother of party stalwart Raja Basharat.
According to the details, the court heard a plea filed by PP-11 candidate’s son, Ahmed.
The SSP operations appeared before the court and expressed his ignorance about Nasir’s arrest.
He told the court that the PP-11 candidate was not in the possession of the police but they received information about his disappearance through its Rescue 15 telephonic service.
The court had earlier given an ultimatum of half an hour and indicated to postpone the polls in the constituency in case Nasir was not recovered.
The judge then adjourned the hearing till 7:30 pm.
When the hearing resumed, the state counsel told the court that Nasir was arrested by the Rawalpindi’s Morgah police in connection with cases related to last year’s May 10 violence.
The court asked the police officials if the action had taken place in their jurisdiction.
As his car was found in Islamabad, the court observed that why did such incidents happen in the jurisdiction of the federal capital.
It regretted that the election for this constituency had been turned controversial even before the polls were held.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir noted that elections are going to be held in Islamabad and such incidents should not happen.
He added that if these candidates were not participating in the elections, could you say that the polls were conducted in a fair and transparent manner.
To this, the lawyer for the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) replied that according to the law, the campaign time had ended 24 hours ago and the absence of one candidate would not affect the polls.
The state counsel requested the IHC to direct Nasir to approach the relevant court.
Justice Tahir ordered the Rawalpindi police chief to present Nasir in the court by 8:30 pm.
He further directed the Morgah SHO to appear in court in person.
Later, Nasir was presented before the IHC. His lawyer said their man had returned. The court asked the lawyer if he wanted to withdraw the case. To this, the lawyer replied in the affirmative.
The court then dismissed the case after the plea was withdrawn by the lawyer.
In a related development, PTI-affiliated independent candidate Raja Basharat, Nasir’s brother, dispelled some media reports that he had pulled out of the race for NA-55 constituency.
He said he condemned these “false and baseless” reports.
“I am participating in the election and a frontline soldier of the PTI,” he added.

1,SC orders extreme caution in matters of faith,Grants bail to an accused charged with distributing proscribed religious book,"The Supreme Court has held that the courts must exercise extreme caution when handling cases involving matters of faith.
Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa authored a five-page judgment while granting bail to an accused charged with distributing a proscribed book, Tafseer-e-Sagheer.
The judgment expressed concern that emotions often overshadow facts in cases related to offences against religion, where individual complainants take precedence over the state. The CJP highlighted the nature of such offences, emphasising that they are not against individuals or personal property.
""We regretfully note that in dealing with cases pertaining to offences against religion facts give way to emotions, as seems to have happened in this case too, and individual complainants supplant the State, even though the very nature of these offences is not against an individual or with regard to personal property,” the order read.
The counsel for the petitioner stated that distributing/disseminating a proscribed book was made an offence by the Punjab Holy Quran (Printing and Recording) (Amendment) Act in the year 2021 whereas the FIR alleged that the petitioner had done this in 2019.
The accused had been charged with distributing a proscribed book in 2019, and the judgment noted that the Constitution prohibits charging someone for an act that was not an offence when committed.
The court ruled that since distributing the book was not an offence in 2019, the petitioner could not be charged for it.

The judgement also noted that as regards the offences under sections 298-C and 295-B of the PPC for which the petitioner is also charged, his counsel submitted that neither the FIR nor the police report (challan), submitted after investigation by the police, allege that the petitioner had done any of the acts mentioned therein to constitute these offences.
""The instant case is also not one wherein the charge could be altered or where the petitioner could have been convicted of a lesser offence to those under sections 298-C and 295-B of the PPC.
Therefore, the offences under sections 298-C and 295-B of the PPC are removed from the Charge framed against the petitioner.""
The court also said that religious compulsion also violates the Divine scheme of accountability in the hereafter. “Even Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Almighty Allah be upon him) was told by the Creator that he is required to only convey the message and should not compel people to believe, as stipulated in surah Ar-Ra’d (chapter 13), verse 40 and in Surah Yunus (chapter 10), verse 99 of the Holy Qur’an.”
The judgement further held that freedom of faith is one of the fundamental tenets of Islam. “But sadly, in matters of religion tempers flare up and the Qur’anic mandate is forsaken,” it added
The court further said that if only the functionaries of the State had heeded the Holy Qur’an, considered the constitution and examined the law then the FIR would not have been registered in respect of the offences.
The court also said that the petitioner was arrested on January 7, 2023, and has remained incarcerated for thirteen months, which is more than double the permissible punishment under section 5 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932.
Trials in respect of offences where the maximum sentence of imprisonment is relatively short must be conducted promptly or the accused should be granted bail. However, bail was declined to the petitioner by the additional sessions judge on 10 June 2023, without considering that the petitioner had already served out the maximum prescribed imprisonment for the said offence.
The learned judge of the high court also dismissed the petitioner’s bail application, through the impugned order dated November 27, 2023, by overlooking this crucially important aspect of the case.
Therefore, the court noted, that since the petitioner has already served out the maximum imprisonment of six months prescribed for the offence if he is found to be guilty of having committed it, keeping him incarcerated would violate a number of his fundamental rights.
Article 9 of the Constitution stipulates that a person shall not be deprived of his liberty save in accordance with the law; the law no longer permits his detention, it added.
""And, Article 10A of the Constitution guarantees the right to a fair trial and due process, which too the petitioner is now being denied. In addition to the violation of these two Fundamental Rights is the overarching right stipulated in Article 4 of the Constitution, ‘To enjoy the protection of law, and, to be treated in accordance with law is the inalienable right of every citizen.’”
The petitioner is no longer being treated in accordance with law because while waiting for the conclusion of his trial he has remained imprisoned for a period much longer than what he could have been punished for if he is found guilty, the judgement read.

3,IHC suspends FBR restructuring notification,Petitioner contends that interim govt does not have mandate to take such decisions,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has suspended a notification issued by the caretaker government on February 4 regarding an implementation committee to restructure the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
A single-member bench comprising Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb issued this order on Wednesday while hearing a petition filed by an FBR officer.
The petitioner contended that the caretaker government does not have the mandate to restructure the tax authority.
He stated that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had informed the interim government about its limitations, but despite that, the government formed the committee.
With less than a week before the general elections, the interim government notified an implementation committee to execute the restructuring of the FBR and set a tight deadline of 72 hours to finalize a legal package.
The eight-member Implementation and Asset Distribution Committee was to give effect to the FBR’s restructuring. Two sub-committees had also been notified to prepare a slew of legal amendments in laws, finalize new statutes, and distribute the assets between the two new organizations.
On February 1, the federal cabinet approved the FBR’s restructuring. After the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar told The Express Tribune that the restructuring of FBR would be implemented by the next elected government, and the next parliament would make requisite changes.
However, immediately after the approval of this plan, the ECP barred the prime minister from taking any action, terming it beyond his constitutional and legal mandate.
According to the ECP, the caretaker prime minister should avoid major reforms in the FBR and keep them pending for consideration by the new government after the General Elections 2024.
The committee notification indicated that the interim government wanted to prepare plans within four to seven days, but no timeframe for submitting this plan to the federal cabinet had been given.

4,"Imran, Elahi cast votes via postal ballot","Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Sheikh Rasheed unable to vote","The postal ballot polling on Wednesday concluded at Central Jail Adiala, with the imprisoned founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Imran Khan, exercising his voting right through a postal ballot.
A total of fifteen prisoners, among them Imran Khan and former Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, participated in the postal ballot voting process.
However, despite pleas from former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and former interior minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed, the prison administration was unable to secure the postal ballots.
Imran Khan finds himself incarcerated with a tally of four criminal convictions, three of which were pronounced just last week. Due to these legal setbacks, he is prohibited from participating in elections or assuming any public office.
The sentences handed down include terms of three, 10, 14, and seven years, all to be served concurrently. Furthermore, Imran Khan faces an extensive legal challenge, with over 150 additional legal cases pending against him.
He remains incarcerated ahead of February 8 (today’s) vote.
Out of the 145 prisoners who applied to vote via postal ballots, only fifteen, including Imran Khan and Pervaiz Ellahi, managed to obtain the necessary materials for casting their votes.
A designated location within the jail was earmarked as a regular polling station for the postal ballot voting.
Due to the high-profile status of Imran and Elahi, postal ballots and voting materials were sent to their cells, where they marked and submitted their votes.
It is worth noting that a total of 145 prisoners, including the founder of PTI, former Punjab chief minister, former foreign minister, and former interior minister, had submitted applications to the prison administration to exercise their voting rights via postal ballots.
However, due to the failure of the prison administration to receive the postal ballots, approximately 130 prisoners, including Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Sheikh Rasheed, were unable to partake in the electoral process.
The cast votes have reportedly been dispatched to the District Returning Officer (DRO) at the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the prescribed manner.

5,Bilawal challenges ‘myth’ about PML-N performance,PPP chief says his party is manages economy better than others,"Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari challenged the “myth” that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government fared better than his party’s government in Sindh, expressing the hope that the people would vote for “real” performance.
Bilawal, who is contesting on three National Assembly constituencies from Larkana, Shahdadkot and Lahore, said in a series of tweets on microblogging website X, that it remained the “fact” that the PPP was better at managing the economy.
Bilawal cited a book, authored by prominent economist Hafiz Pasha, titled ‘Human Security in Pakistan’, in his tweets, saying that Sindh performed better than Punjab in many areas. He also recalled his challenge to the PML-N leaders for a debate.
“It is truly unfortunate that PMLN did not agree to a debate for PM candidates. One myth I hoped to address is the fiction that due to PMLN, Punjab performs better than other provinces,” the PPP chairman wrote in one of his posts.
“As Hafiz Pasha’s book; ‘Human Security in Pakistan’ demonstrates. Sindh now preforms better than Punjab in many areas. Such as governance, freedom from want, freedom from fear, gross regional income and human security over all,” he continued.
“PMLN knows this and this is why they ran away from a debate. Unfortunately the media perpetuates the myth of PMLNs performance. The people know the truth. IA the people will vote for real performance over ‘showbazi’ tomorrow,” he added.
In another post on X, Bilawal shared data about Pakistan’s exports of goods and services, and said that everyone agreed that increasing exports was the only way out for country from the ongoing economic crisis.
The dats showed Pakistan’s exports were worth $20.5 billion in 2008; $31.5 billion in 2013; [the period when the PPP was in power from 2008-13]; $30.5 billion in 2018; [the PML-N government from 2013-18] $39.5 billion in 2022 [the PTI government] and $36 billion in 2023 [the PDM coalition government].
“Every time PMLN has been in control of finance exports have decreased. The last time PPP was incharge exports increased the most despite a global recession. PPP is better at managing the economy – fact!” he concluded.

6,When PML-N extended a helping hand to PTI,"In a surprising twist, influential PML-N leader helps locate young PTI supporter in time of need amid crackdown","A quiet village in Mandi Bahauddin found itself ablaze with whispers of a police raid on PTI workers and supporters after sunset. Farooq*, arrested a few days ago after he fell down, has emerged covered in mud, after a chase through the narrow village streets. 
For giving a chase, he was beaten up before being bundled up in a police van. “The police beat me up with sticks,” Farooq said.However, as the police van carrying two party workers sputtered towards the jail, the influential one was allowed to go home while the other one was thrown in the jail with several other PTI workers; all fearing what cases would they be fixed in by the morning.
Back in the village, the family of the young PTI supporter was on their toes to, initially, locate his exact location and, then, see who could help them get him released before being booked in a case. They knew who could help them but were reluctant to directly ask him because of the bitter rivalry.
A common relative was then approached to see if he could ask none other than an influential PML-N leader to help them out.Just minutes after the screen of the PML-N leader brightened up and he put the phone to his ear, he was calling his contacts to trace the young PTI worker’s exact location.
Soon, they found that and, without wasting a minute, they were on the way to get Farooq released. Using his contacts, they entered the prison and asked the officials concerned to locate the young man, which they did.
Read: PTI ‘needs to follow conciliatory path’
Before they could clear his name from files and head home, two other young men, who were arrested in a separate raid, recognized the PML-N leader and urged him to help them out as well as no one else was coming for them. After a few ifs and buts, all three were let go. Soon, they were reunited with their families.
However, as soon as Farooq reached home, the PTI workers came up with a narrative that he was released after PTI’s influential leader, who had alighted from the police van midway, approached a judge and sought his help to get him released from prison. The villagers then started choosing the story that suited them.
This could be one of the rarest occasions where PML-N came to PTI’s rescue amid an ongoing crackdown against PTI workers and supporters in the run-up to the general elections as the crackdown is still going on in different areas.
In one of the raids, several PTI workers and supporters, including a student of 9th grade, were arrested from Islamabad’s Ghauri Town area on February 6.The student whose father is a lawyer by profession and once served as a polling agent for a PML-N leader in Islamabad before deciding to stand with Imran Khan shared that he along with other lawyers and the PTI candidate in NA-48, Ali Bukhari, ran from pillar to post to get his son released, saying he finally succeeded at 2am on Tuesday night. “My son is so afraid that he isn’t even going in the street after what happened with him,” the lawyer Rana Abdul Qayyum said.
“He is just a 15-year-old boy; he has a whole life ahead of him; I don’t know how will he overcome the trauma.”“Can we still call these elections free, fair and transparent,” Qayyum questioned, regretting that political rivalry shouldn’t have reached this extent.
Though the political elite has been promising to end the politics of hatred and division, things would start unfolding once the elections are over, to say the least.

7,Is a coalition govt in the offing?,"PPP, PML-N complete pre-poll consultation, final decisions after vote results","An analysis of the election campaign for Thursday’s (today) vote shows the possibility of the a coalition government at the Centre, and in this regard both the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) have already completed preliminary consultation.
The leaderships of two parties have assessed basic questions as to how many seats they will be able to win in the election and how the other parties will fare in the gigantic exercise. Besides, both the parties also had their assessment about the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed Independent candidates.
These two parties have underscored the importance of the role of independent candidates in the formation of the next federal government, as their internal assessment suggest that based on the election campaign it would be difficult for a single party to win simple majority.
However, any formula for the formation of a coalition government at the Centre will be worked out in the light of the election results. A PML-N source told The Express Tribune, that after the elections, the party will be is in a position to form the federal government they were not sure about simple majority.
The source added that the party thought that if there were lesser seats than expected, the government could be formed with the cooperation of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP), Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and other like-minded parties and independents.
If necessary, the same formula, which was used to form a Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led coalition government in 2022, could be used this time, the source said. In the light of the political situation, the PML-N can discuss the matter of government formation with the PPP.
Continuing, the sources said, Nawaz Sharif was the PML-N’s candidate for the post of prime minister. However, keeping in mind the emerging political situation or other issues, if arose, the name of Shahbaz Sharif could be considered for the premiership. However, the final decision will be taken by Nawaz.
On the other hand, PPP sources said that Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the party’s candidate for prime ministership. They added that after evaluating the election results, the strategy for the government formation would be worked out.
According to these sources, PPP Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari will decide the matters related to the government formation, while the party chief Bilawal Bhutto Zardari will consult and take the like-minded parties. The PPP would also try to court successful independent candidates into its camp.
PTI sources claim that they would be successful in the National Assembly contests. Senior political analyst Zia Abbas said that the PML-N was likely to get most of seats in the election and it might form the government with the cooperation of the like-minded parties and independents.
Besides, Abbas continued, the PPP will succeed in forming the government in Sindh and the PML-N and the IPP and others would join ranks to form the government in Punjab. However, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Balochistan would see coalition governments.
PTI sources claim that they would be more successful in the contests for the National Assembly but Abbas said he did not see any improvement in the political situation of the PTI, adding that the party would get less number of seats.
According to Abbas, the first priority of the next federal government would be the revival of economy, in which it would have the full cooperation of the military leadership. It is apparent that the establishment wanted to strengthen democracy and the parliamentary system in the country.
