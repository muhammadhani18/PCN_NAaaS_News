1,Railways starts local manufacturing  of high-speed coaches,620 goods wagons to be made under another technology-transfer agreement with China.,"LAHORE: For the first time, Pakistan Railway has started local manufacturing of 184 state-of-the-art high-speed passenger coaches under a technology-transfer agreement with China.
Since a team of the department has also started pre-shipment inspection of the required material in China for making coaches, the manufacturing of 620 high-capacity flat goods’ wagons has also been launched in Pakistan under another technology-transfer agreement with China, Dawn has learnt.
“We have started manufacturing of the 184 modern high-speed designed (up to 140km) passenger coaches after the required machinery was installed at our Islamabad carriage factory under the technology-transfer agreement with China,” PR’s Chief Executive Officer Amir Ali Baloch said while talking to Dawn on Thursday.
“We will also receive other required material from China soon, as our team is currently there for a pre-shipment inspection of the same,” he added.

620 goods wagons to be made under another technology-transfer agreement with China

According to him, the manufacturing of the high-speed coaches will gradually end the PR’s 1,964 low-speed designed (100km per hour or so) coaches being used by the department at the moment.
In November 2021, the PR while planning to upgrade its rolling stock had inked an agreement worth $140 million with China Railway Construction Corporation Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Company for the supply of 230 high-speed coaches. In this regard, the department had, in the last week of November 2022 received a consignment of 46 completely built units (CBUs) of high-speed modern coaches from China under the technology-transfer component of the 230 coaches purchase contract.
Similarly, the department received various consignments of 200 CBUs of modern goods/freight wagons from China under another agreement of the procurement of total 820 wagons under which 620 wagons are to be manufactured in the carriage factory Risalpur and Lahore Mughalpura Workshop.
The modern train coaches and wagons received from China in the form of CBUs had been designed for a speed of 140km and 100km per hour respectively. The 820 wagons included 800 freight wagons and 20 brake wagons.
“Besides high-speed feature, the suspension of both coaches and trains has also been designed with modern technology,” the CEO said while responding to a question.
To another question, Mr Baloch said the new technology of manufacturing the goods’ wagons had been adopted by the PR 20 years ago. But the manufacturing of these wagons was done under semi-complete knock-down method. But, now under the new agreement with China, the wagons would be manufactured locally under the complete knock-down method/technology, he maintained.
He said the PR, at present, had over 3,000 freight wagons and it wants to increase it to total 4,000 in phases.
Talking about increasing the railway income, he said the PR would achieve its annual revenue target of Rs85 billion till June 30, this year which is Rs22bn more than the last fiscal ended on June 30, 2023.

Dar, the son of Rehana Imtiaz Dar, the candidate supported by the PTI in NA-71 Sialkot, was released on bail after 75 days.  
On coming out of jail, a large number of PTI workers garlanded him and showered him with flower petals. They raised slogans in favour of their party and Umar Dar. At his home, his mother Rehana Imtiaz Dar received him and mother and son hugged each other.  
Speaking to the workers, Dar said he had returned to his home after 10 months. He said that after May 9, persecution of the PTI workers had started. He said God had given him courage and strength due to which he had reached his home. He said his wishes and prayers were with all the workers and leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) who were missing from their homes or locked up in jails since May 9. He paid tributes to his mother for her courage.  
Umar Dar went underground after the May 9 while police and security agencies kept looking for him. He was arrested 75 days ago by police and security agencies from a hotel during a joint operation. He was booked in the cases registered with various police stations of Sialkot.  
Umar Dar’s brother had filed a petition in the high court for recovery of his brother as they could not find his whereabouts and the police were not showing his arrest.  
Sialkot police admitted arresting him on the orders of the LHC 10 days after his arrest. His mother Rehana Dar had released a video on social media, alleging that her son was arrested to stop her from submitting nomination papers and contesting election against Khwaja Asif of the PML-N.

3,Food bags: families data being verified,The distribution of food bags will be made between March 5 and 15.,"GUJRAT: The data of families registered with the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) is being verified by the land revenue field staff as well as the local bodies employees for the distribution of bags carrying dry food items under the Nigehban Ramzan programme of the Punjab government.

4,Election symbol case: LHC reserves verdict on plea against ECP powers,"The law officer pointed out that the PTI had challenged the ECP decision before the Peshawar High Court, but did not assail Section 215 of the Election Act, 2017.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Thursday reserved its verdict on an intra-court appeal (ICA) challenging the powers of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to withdraw the electoral symbol of a political party.
A two-judge bench, comprising Justice Ali Baqar Najafi and Justice Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, heard lengthy arguments of the appellant side and the federal government.
At the outset of the hearing, the bench asked Azhar Siddique, the counsel for the appellant, if he had approached the court on behalf of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), which lost its symbol following an ECP decision.
The lawyer said he assailed the powers of the ECP, which indirectly dissolved PTI as a political party.
Additional Attorney General Mirza Nasar Ahmad argued that the ECP decision to withdraw the electoral symbol from the PTI was a consequence of not holding intra-party polls.
To a court’s query, he said the withdrawal of election symbol from a political party also impacted voters. However, he said only a political party could contest elections on a common symbol, not individual candidates.
The law officer pointed out that the PTI had challenged the ECP decision before the Peshawar High Court, but did not assail Section 215 of the Election Act, 2017.
Mr Siddique argued that both a party and a candidate had a fundamental right to have an election symbol of choice. He said the ECP decision proved to be detrimental for the PTI in the election.
Justice Najafi asked the appellant’s counsel if the affected party, the PTI, had not challenged the powers of the ECP.
“Pakistan has a democratic system. A political party sans democracy should face the consequences,” the judge observed.
The appellant’s counsel asked the bench to allow the ICA and also set aside a decision by a single bench whereby a writ petition was dismissed.
The appeal said Section 215 of the Elections Act 2017, dealing with eligibility of a party to obtain election symbols, was against the Constitution.
It pleaded that the right to contest the election under a common symbol could not be taken away from the candidates of a political party. It said the ECP, being a constitutional body, was not a court or a tribunal, therefore, any power wrongly assumed by it for taking away fundamental rights was illegal in terms of Article 8 of the Constitution.

The Mohsin Naqvi-led caretaker government had got “The Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment (Amendment) Ordinance 2023” promulgated after the DG had ‘dared’ to lodge FIRs against Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) officers.
The ACE DG had lodged two FIRs against three PAS officers – former secretary of services Masood Mukhtar, former secretary of coordination to chief minister Dr Asif Tufail in a case of posting Muhammad Khan Bhatti on deputation as principal secretary to chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, and FIR against former special secretary to chief minister Dr Khurram Shahzad, among others, in a case of “illegally” allowing a sugar mill to enhance its sanctioned crushing capacity.
The bureaucracy had sprung up against the lodging of FIRs against the PAS officers and maneuvered the caretaker chief minister, who allowed the initiation of a summary by Additional Chief Secretary Ahmad Raza Sarwar. The summary was immediately approved and sent to Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman, who promulgated the ordinance on Dec 1 last year.
Sources in the civil secretariat told Dawn that there seems no urgency as no summary has been initiated for the newly elected chief minister Maryam Nawaz for her nod to take the matter to the Punjab Assembly for legislation. The sources say the ACE DG’s powers have been restored and could be exercised in required circumstances.
Through the ordinance, the civil bureaucracy had bound the ACE DG to send a reference to obtain prior permission in writing for BPS-01 to BPS-16 from the appointing authority, for BPS-17 from the secretary of the administrative department, for BPS-18 and BPS-19 from the additional chief secretary, and for a deputy commissioner, commissioner, secretary to the government, head of an attached department or any other public servant in BPS- 20 and above, from the chief secretary – before registering a criminal case. 
The ordinance required that the “secretary or the additional chief secretary or the chief secretary, as the case may be, may constitute a committee of at least three members and may refer the reference to such committee for its examination.
The committee was supposed to give its recommendations to the secretary or the additional chief secretary or the chief secretary, as the case may be, within 15 days from the receipt of the reference and the secretary or the additional chief secretary or the chief secretary, as the case may be, shall decide whether to grant the permission for registration of criminal case against public servant or not.”
The ordinance had also barred the ACE that “no public servant up to BPS-17 shall be arrested without prior permission in writing of the administrative secretary or head of an attached department, and no public servant in BPS-18 or BPS-19 shall be arrested without prior permission in writing of the ACS and no deputy commissioner, commissioner or administrative secretary, head of an attached department, and no other public servant of BPS-20 and above shall be arrested without prior permission, in writing, of the chief secretary.
The amended ordinance had also empowered the chief secretary that he could call for the record of any case or preliminary probe, pending or finalized, for purposes of satisfying himself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any order passed or decision taken in such preliminary probe by the DG or any other officer of the ACE.

6,Move to rent out exam centres set aside,The petitioner's counsel argued that the Punjab government was renting out the examination centres’ building due to financial losses.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Thursday set aside a decision of the Punjab caretaker government of renting out Lawrence Road examination centres for non-educational purposes.
Justice Shahid Karim passed the order allowing a petition filed by Kashif Shahzad, the president of the Punjab Teachers’ Union, and others.
Advocate Mian Dawood, on behalf of the petitioners, argued that the Punjab government had taken a stance that it was renting out the examination centres’ building due to financial losses.
He said the government also took a plea of traffic congestion around the Lawrence Road to rent out the examination centres of Lahore Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE).
He argued that the superior courts had long settled the point that a property allocated for education purposes cannot be used for any other purpose.
Additional Advocate General Samia Khalid argued that the government had the power to take the building on rent.
Asked about the purpose to get the examination centres on rent, the law officer said staff of the Higher Education Department (HED) would be shifted to the building.
Justice Karim considered the reply of the law officer as the government’s admission to seek the building for non-education purposes.
The judge observed that the record showed that the government forced the BISE to get the examination centre’s building on rent.
BISE counsel Mehboob Sheikh stated that the board could rent out its properties.
However, the petitioners’ counsel said the board was authorised to rent out its properties but only for educational purposes.
The judge directed the government to formally advertise if it wanted to rent out the building of the examination centres but only for educational purposes.

Azhar Ali, who was recently posted as the SHO, made public announcements through a megaphone in the busy areas of the city that “no one is allowed to go out of their houses after 12 midnight without any reason” like going to the hospital in an emergency.  
A video of such an announcement went viral on social media, showing SHO Azhar Ali making the announcement in a busy roundabout of the city, saying that anybody seen outside their home in the city or in its chowks would be sent to the lock-up immediately as noble people and gentlemen would never come out of houses after midnight. 
Not only this, the SHO issued threats of taking the law into his hands, saying if anyone would do any wrongful act in the city, that person would not only be sent to the lock-up but he (SHO) himself would break his legs also. 
However, he tried to sugar-coat his threat by offering help of every kind to citizens, asking them to approach him without fear if they faced any issue.  
The public announcement by the SHO created panic among the general public, especially youth, who go out of houses at night for dining, meeting their friends or relatives in the city being the district headquarters. 
The people were found wondering if there was any justification of the order of the SHO who tried to create a curfew-like situation in the city, threatening the citizens with violence besides being sent to the lock-up without committing a crime. 
The video ignited a debate on social media about civil liberties and police action to confine the public to their houses at night in a city. 
Talking to the media, SHO Azhar said the video uploaded on social media was out of context as he was warning the criminals and their patrons of strict action as he had done during his previous posting as SHO of the Lalian Police Station in the district. 
District Police Officer Chiniot Abdullah Ahmad defended the officer, saying SHO Azhar was a responsible officer. The DPO denied the existence of the questionable announcement made by his subordinate. 
However, when this news of announcement by the SHO was telecast on the top electronic media channels, the Punjab inspector general of police transferred him out of the district.  
“Inspector Azhar Abbas,SHO Operations Chiniot city is hereby transferred to Gujranwala regional police office with immediate effect,” the notification said.

According to Auqaf administrator Imran Ahmed, thousands of devotees with their families are camping at the venue where they arrived on their motorcycles, rickshaws, tractor-trolleys and buses along with the food stuff, ration packs, cooking cylinders and tents. 
They have gathered at the Channan Pir shrine from across the country to pay homage to their spiritual figure to spend the night of the last Thursday of the festival. 
During the day festivities, the devotees tied thread knots with a tree at the shrine and prayed for acceptance of their Mannats. They also sacrificed animals, spending the night in the walled arena amid security provided by police and other law enforcement agencies. The searchlights and CCTV cameras were installed along the boundary wall for security for the night.  
The Auqaf department arranged shops and set up bazaars having edibles stalls for the facilitation of the devotees. Besides, a number of entertainment and recreation facilities, including theatres, had also been provided at the venue for them to perform round the clock there.  
The festivities at Channan Pir would continue for whole of the Thursday night and they would come to an end with Fajr prayers on Friday (today) when the devotees would start returning to their homes and the areas. By Friday noon (today), the whole venue would stand vacated. 
Imran Ahmed told Dawn that it was the third week of the mela that opened Feb 11 and its first Thursday fell on Feb 15. The main activities happen on every Thursday during the duration of the festival when the devotees spend the whole night near the shrine.  
Ahmed said originally the festival comprised seven weeks (Thursdays) and was scheduled to go on until April 10.
