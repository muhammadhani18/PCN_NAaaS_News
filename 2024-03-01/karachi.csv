0,Food delivery man shot dead near Karachi’s KU,Police unsure about the exact motive since the assailants did not rob him.,"KARACHI: A young delivery man was shot dead on main University Road in Gulshan-i-Iqbal in the small hours of Thursday morning, police said.
While the police were unsure about the exact motive since the assailants did not rob him, victim’s family believed that 22-year-old Muhammad Waqas was killed by armed robbers.

Area SHO Mohammed Nawaz ruled out the possibility of a robbery-related murder, saying the killers did not take away his cash, cell phone or the motorbike. Victim’s cousin Awais told the media that Waqas worked as a delivery man for foodpanda. He said that after being shot Waqas phoned his cousin but could not tell them what had exactly happened with him.
He said that the victim was a good human being and had no enmity with anyone.
The cousin believed that Waqas was shot dead by robbers over resistance.

1,"SBCA director general can’t exercise full authority, Sindh High Court rules",• Asks provincial govt to form an oversight committee to supervise building authority’s affairs,"• Asks provincial govt to form an oversight committee to supervise building authority’s affairs             
KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Thursday observed that the director general of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) could not act as an authority in the absence of an oversight committee and ordered the provincial government to notify the committee to supervise the total functioning of the SBCA, including its director general. 
The two-judge bench headed by Justice Salahuddin Panhwar deplored that the local government department had failed to comply with a mandatory provision of law regarding formation of an oversee committee and the whole burden shifted upon courts to examine illegalities allowed by officials of the SBCA with regard to construction of buildings.
At the outset of the hearing, the SBCA DG filed some documents, including a notification, about the appointment of the DG in compliance with the previous court order. 
The bench noted that the DG was notified to act as an authority for the whole province while under the law the DG could not be appointed to act as a ‘body cooperate’, council, department, functionary or an organisation in his individual capacity. 
While referring to Section 4 (authority) of Sindh Building Control Ordinance (SBCO), 1979, it also observed that if the language of the statute was clear, the only duty of court was to give effect to it and the court had no business to look into the consequences of such interpretation. 
“The ordinary definition of the words ‘body cooperate’ is a cooperation consisting a body of persons legally authorised to act as one person while being distinct from that person. But it cannot consist of an individual,” it added. 
The bench further noted that prima facie, the notification in question was issued in flagrant violation and derogation of Section 4 of the SBCO. 
“Thus, the government Sindh shall issue notification within the scope of Section 4 of the ordinance 1979, with the consultation of the law department within a period of one month,” the bench in its order said. 
A notification, issued in August 2020, was placed before the court by the LG department about formation of the oversee committee headed by the secretary local government department to supervise all affairs of the SBCA. 
However, a provincial law officer contended that the oversee committee was abolished through a notification issued in December 2022. 
Thereafter, the bench said the oversight committee as provided under Section 4-B of SBCO, was not functioning while another notification issued in December 2022 reflected that a sub-committee was constituted by the provincial cabinet regarding amendments to Section 4-B by replacing the oversee committee with the government body. 
It noted that the LG department had failed to comply with the relevant provision of law and ordered to notify the oversee committee by joining all stakeholders as per law in 30 days. 
The SBCA DG also informed the court that around 300 posts were vacant and as per rules, the provincial government was required to make such recruitments. 
“Needless to mention that the government of Sindh has approved a policy to recruit officials from BS-5 to BS-15 through third party; hence that method shall be adopted by the SBCA. Accordingly, the local government department shall amend respective rules in view of the amended rules I [of] the Civil Servant Act and for other institutions and corporate bodies,” the bench in it order concluded.

2,Five students get bail in Karachi Seaview aerial firing case,"The five students, along with around 600-700 others, have been booked in a case pertaining to aerial firing, rash driving, etc.","KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Thursday granted bail to five college students arrested on Wednesday for allegedly carrying out aerial firing during an event described by authorities as ‘batch bunk’ in the Seaview area.
The investigating officer produced the five suspects — Bilal Akhund, Jabber Khan, Muzammil, Rajab Ali, and Shaheer Khan— before Judicial Magistrate (South) Mazhar Ali and sought their 14-day physical remand for further investigation.

The magistrate granted bail to the held students against a surety bond of Rs20,000 each.
The five students, along with around 600-700 others, have been booked in a case pertaining to aerial firing, rash driving, etc.

3,DHA residents’ hearts sink before rains in Karachi,"It was a chaos when it rained last time, president of Clifton Defence Community says","KARACHI: Defence Housing Authority resident community groups were abuzz with rain alert news since early on Thursday. 
Many residents were saying that their circumstances, due to dug up roads here and there, were such that they were afraid of normal rains and here the forecast was for heavy rain with thunder, which was extremely worrisome for them. 
The president of the Clifton Defence Community (CDC) told Dawn that they felt vulnerable during the rains in DHA. “Even normal rain is scary for us. It too can give us misery,” he said. 
“There are ditches dug up everywhere, some in the name of building storm-water drains, some for laying new Sui Southern Gas Company lines or some other utility laying cables or the other. The last time it rained, which was just a few weeks ago, a car had also fallen into one such ditch as you can’t see the dug up areas when it rains because there is water everywhere,” he pointed out. 

It was a chaos when it rained last time, president of Clifton Defence Community says 

“You can’t see whether the water is inches deep or several feet deep. There is a need for proper fencing and barriers in such instances, which was not done last time,” he added. 
“We reached out to DHA and Cantonment Board Clifton [CBC] for this. The DHA did not respond but CBC has said that they are ready in case of all rain-related emergencies. They have put little fencing in some places and plastic tape in others. But we believe that such measures are not enough in normal situations and here we are hearing of more than usual rain,” said Husayn Abbas, a resident of Phase 7 extension. 
“Where other institutions are taking care and precautions and sharing emergency centre phone numbers to call in case of emergencies, the CBC look unprepared in comparison. They are not even issuing awareness messages on their social media pages where there is only publicity about their cosmetic works in DHA. Still, there is a DHA business number, 1092, which all us residents know of. Whether it will be of use or not remains to be seen,” said director of municipal affairs, CDC, Mohammad Ali. 
“The real concern of the residents is not being addressed by the DHA. We want to see rescue camps set up at places, machines deployed to pump out water and pull out stuck cars, etc. Right now, we can only pray that rain doesn’t happen. Because if it does, we are sure to expect disaster,” concluded Arshad Hussain, a resident of Phase 5.

4,Social ‘re-engineering’ sought to overcome country’s challenges,Speakers discuss journalist Mahmood Sham’s autobiography,"KARACHI: Pakistan has been in a constant decline and ‘we are still struggling to become a nation’.  
Those who are highly educated are going abroad while the less-privileged are joining separatist and extremist groups. The solution to all these issues is a reconsideration of the political, social and economic systems in the country.  
These views were expressed by speakers at a discussion about senior journalist and writer Mahmood Sham’s autobiography, Sham Bakhair, which was held at the Arts Council’s Haseena Moin Hall on Thursday.
The event was presided over by Dr Amjad Saqib, who is the founder and of Akhuwat Foundation. 
Speaking on the occasion, Dr Saqib praised Mr Sham’s work and his creative energies. He said the book contained deep social, political and economic insights. Along with that, it also contained truth and simplicity so the people, especially the youth, could easily read it, he said.

Speakers discuss journalist Mahmood Sham’s autobiography 

He said he felt that the primary question in the book was why the people of Pakistan could not become a nation, why the country lost the right path and why it had been in a decline.  
Dr Saqib said he believed that the answer and solution to this was a ‘re-engineering’ of the social, political, economic spheres of the country to unite Pakistanis and make them aware of their own intellectual heritage and knowledge which had been lost after the enslavement of their thought by the ‘intellectual colonisation’ by the west.
Mr Sham spoke about the current political happenings in the country and reflected on the martial laws it had faced. Commenting on the issues, he said the highly educated in the country were moving abroad and those who were less educated were joining separatist and extremist groups. 
However, he said the people had understood the real problem in the country and they had come together on the Feb 8 elections to show their decision. 
Scholar and academic Dr Syed Jaffer Ahmed said a great writer and journalist could not only see the issues of his present time but also get hints about the future. “The autobiographies of such people are reflective of not just their lives but also of their age and Mr Sham’s book is an addition to such books,” Mr Ahmed said, adding that Mr Sham had written very important and eye opening historical facts in the book and, therefore, students should read that book. 
President Arts Council Muhammad Ahmed Shah said that Mr Sham’s autobiography, apart from being ‘Sham Namah’ was also ‘Pakistan Namah’ as it reflected the issues of the country. 
Syed Sarmad Ali, managing director Jang Media Group, spoke about his relationship with Mr Sham. He said his personal relation with Mr Sham was more than the professional relation. 
Twelve-year-old Uroosh Fatima read out passages from the book. Aftab Memon, former chairman export processing zone, praised the vastness of the book and the manner in which the author had woven all the events. 
Mehnaz Hasan Zaidi, former director general information department Sindh, spoke about how she, as censor officer in the information department, had to censor newspapers and other publications during dictatorship. 
Speakers from India shared their views through video messages. Taran Vijay, chairman Monuments Authority, Ministry of Culture, India, congratulated Mr Sham and praised his works. Indian scholar and poetess Dr Amber Abid said the book was an important historical document whereas Professor Akhtarul Wasey, an Indian educator, hoped that Mr Sham’s book will spread love and bring people closer to each other.

5,Urdu adaptation of Perfect Wedding to be staged in April,KARACHI: An Urdu adaptation of the play Perfect Wedding by Robin Hawdon titled Hotel Jaan-i-Jaan will be staged at...,"KARACHI: An Urdu adaptation of the play Perfect Wedding by Robin Hawdon titled Hotel Jaan-i-Jaan will be staged at the Arts Council of Pakistan from April 19 for 10 days. This was announced at a press conference by the council’s President Ahmed Shah on Thursday evening.
He said a bunch of students of the council had made a theatre group and since the council was always willing to help youngsters in artistic pursuits, it had put its weight behind them. To support them senior actor Yasir Hussein was appearing in the play as a principal character. “Farhan Aalam, who teaches theatre here, will direct the play and Babar Jamal has adapted it in Urdu. I’ve seen the movie based on the drama and I still remember some of its lines,” he said.
Babar Jamal said it’s an adaption of the Robin Hawdon play. “We have adapted it in accordance with our society. It’s the story of two friends one of whom is getting married. It’s a funny, farcical play which can also be called a comedy of errors.”
Producer Raahim Bukhari thanked Mr Shah for accepting his proposal. “I went to him with an idea, he lent an attentive ear and said ‘go-ahead’. I’m also thankful to Yasir bhai. I gave him just a single call and he agreed.” He then introduced his team members to the media.
Actor Yasir Hussein said it’s 2024, and the council and its president were helping a group of artists. “I remember we did a play in 2009-2010. It went well. People cried and laughed, but didn’t buy tickets for it. We went to Shah Sahib and told him that despite the drama’s success, we weren’t able to sell tickets. He replied there’s no problem. We said we needed to give the council its money for using its stage. He said we didn’t have to give the money. We thought he was kidding and soon some people would get hold of us. But he wasn’t kidding. Ever since, I have an unbreakable relationship with the council.
“When the students called me, I liked the idea. I wanted to do theatre, too. It’s going to be an entertaining project. I have only done originals and not any adaptation. This is my first time. It’s nicely written. We have turned the story into a Pakistani tale. It’s very funny. It won’t let the audience leave their seats.”

Burki and Prof Zafarulllah Chaudhry.

Prof Gondal also shed light on the various milestones achieved by the CPSP, such as extending its training network to Saudi Arabia, Nepal, and the UK, and getting recognition from the ACCME, which was accepted internationally.
“The CPSP’s department of medical education has been a WHO Collaborating Center in the Eastern Mediterranean Region for Education and Research since 1996,” he told the audience while mentioning the institution’s academic linkages with reputed organisations in the world.

The protesters led by Sindh-Taraqqi-pasand Party district president Akram Bajkani held a four-hour sit-in in front of SSP office said that unabated robberies, thefts and kidnappings, which had become order of the day in the district, had spread fear and unrest among citizens across Kandhkot-Kashmore district.
Bajkani and other leaders said that people had gotten sick of the crimes as police had completely failed to restore peace in the district and provide security to citizens. Over the past 24 hours, several crimes had been committed across the district but police had been arresting innocent citizens instead of taking action against outlaws, he said.
They claimed that police picked up innocent citizens, kept them hidden somewhere for several days and then declared them criminals only to target them in staged encounters. They demanded higher authorities establish law and order in the district and bring criminals to justice, otherwise, they would continue their protest.
