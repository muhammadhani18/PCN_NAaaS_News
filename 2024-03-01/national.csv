0,Income tax filers drop 35%,Interim govt misses crucial monthly target as FBR fails to expand tax base,"The interim government has failed to broaden the tax base, with the number of income tax return filers shrinking 35% to just under 3.9 million compared to last year, amid challenges to achieve monthly tax collection targets.

The caretaker government, whose rule has now effectively ended with the oath of the new National Assembly, also remained unable to tax retailers, neither was it able to suspend the mobile phone connections of non-filers of income tax returns. There was hope that, unlike politicians, technocrats would move against powerful retailers.

Sources told The Express Tribune that, contrary to the hype created around bringing reforms in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the figures of income tax return filers have significantly dropped.

This is the second consecutive month in which the government has missed the monthly tax collection target. However, due to better collection in the previous months, the FBR has somehow managed to achieve the eight-month tax target of Rs5.83 trillion.

The FBR, whose performance remained exceptionally good during the first half of the fiscal year, started facing problems from January this year. This coincided with the interim finance minister’s attempts to restructure the tax machinery despite opposition from some cabinet members and questions over the mandate of the caretakers. The Election Commission of Pakistan also advised the interim government against restructuring the tax machinery.

Shrinking Tax Base

In November last year, Pakistan had shared a plan with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to increase the number of income tax return filers to 6.5 million by June 2024. The interim government decided to set up district tax offices to expand the base by shifting half of the tax force in the regional tax offices to these new offices.

The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) had also given the interim government the target to increase the tax base by at least one million during the current fiscal year over last year’s figure. When these targets were set, about 5 million people had filed tax returns for the last year.

As of the end of February, sources said, the total income tax returns received by the FBR stood at just 3.88 million – a number that was 2.1 million or 35% short compared to tax year 2022. The government faced a reduction in the number of filers across all four categories: companies, associations of persons, business individuals, and the salaried class.

However, senior FBR officials hope that the figure will see a sharp jump in March after the publication of the Active Taxpayers List on Monday. All non-filers’ names will be omitted from the new list, which will double the rate of withholding taxes on their transactions.

Details showed that compared to 92,704 associations that filed returns in the previous year, this year the figure has so far remained at 91,135. Similarly, in the last tax year, about 77,600 firms had filed their returns, which have now dropped to less than 72,000, showing a decline of about 8%.

The major reduction in the number of filers was in the case of business individuals, as about 1.6 million or 43% fewer persons filed their income tax returns this year, said the sources. In the last tax year, about 3.8 million business individuals filed returns, which have now shrunk to 2.2 million.

Similarly, about 22% or 435,000 fewer salaried persons filed their returns this year. As against nearly 2 million salaried persons who filed returns last year, only 1.55 submitted their annual statements of wealth and income this year.

The FBR had sent a proposal to the finance minister to impose tax on retailers, but she left the matter for the next government, according to the sources. Similarly, a committee was also constituted to suspend the mobile phone connections of non-filers, but no order was issued in this regard.

A senior FBR official said that despite the low number of filers, there were about 840,000 new filers this year, which showed the efforts of the tax machinery. Out of this, the big number was business individuals, as 510,000 business persons became return filers for the first time.

Nearly 11 million individuals and companies are registered with the FBR, but less than 7 million did not file their annual returns.

Tax Collection

The FBR has managed to achieve its eight-month tax collection target of Rs5.829 trillion, thanks to better performance in the first six months of the fiscal year. A timely decision by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the super tax case also helped the FBR get Rs6 billion on the last day, which in return became the reason to achieve the eight-month target.

The FBR, for the second time in this fiscal year, missed the monthly target by a margin of Rs33 billion or 4.6%. Under an arrangement with the IMF, Pakistan may have to kick in a mini-budget if the monthly collection falls short of the target by more than 1%.

The tax authorities attribute the shortfall in the monthly collections to the interim finance minister’s drive to restructure the FBR and the increased number of holidays in February.

The provisional collection figures showed that the FBR has so far collected Rs5.83 trillion, showing an increase of Rs1.34 trillion or 30% over the collection made during the same period of the previous fiscal year.

Till December, the FBR’s management was confident of achieving the Rs9.415 trillion annual target despite a slump in imports. Income tax collection amounted to Rs2.76 trillion, up over Rs800 billion, or 41%, during the first eight months of this fiscal year.

Sales tax and customs duties remained the weakest areas. Sales tax collection reached over Rs2 trillion, which was Rs316 billion, or 19%, more than the last fiscal year. The FBR collected Rs352 billion in FED, and the collection of customs duty stood at Rs710 billion.

Details showed that as against February’s target of Rs714 billion, the FBR could provisionally pool Rs681 billion – a shortfall of Rs33 billion. But there was an increase of Rs162 billion or 32% in collection compared to the same month of the last fiscal year.

1,Akhtar urges early IMF deal,Calls public debt unsustainable which is at heart of economic challenges,"Pakistan is facing the challenge of unsustainable public debt and the new government should reach an early agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a long-term bailout package to continue difficult reforms, said outgoing Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar on Thursday.

In a departing note in the monthly economic outlook, Akhtar said that market confidence had been restored during the past few months and as a result the gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to grow around 3% in the second quarter of the current fiscal year. In the first quarter, the economic growth was 2.1%.

“At the heart of economic challenges is the unsustainable public debt position, with Pakistan in breach of the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act (FRDL) since 2013,” said the minister.

Although she claimed to have achieved fiscal consolidation, the budget deficit in the first half was 58% higher than the comparative period of last year, which was a reason for debt unsustainability.

Akhtar said that it was imperative that the new government completed the last review of IMF programme that would lead to the release of $1.2 billion loan tranche.

“Perhaps more important is that the new government reaches an early agreement with the IMF staff on a new medium-term facility, providing an anchor to carry out difficult reforms,” she said.

Pakistan’s debt has ballooned to Rs81 trillion and it now spends on debt servicing an amount that is more than the net federal income. Any future IMF programme should consider the possibility of debt restructuring, according to independent analysts.

Akhtar stressed that the next government should focus on restructuring the FBR, privatisation of loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs) including PIA and implementation of the SOE policy for improved governance and financial performance.

Despite all-out support for the privatisation ministry and the finance ministry, the caretaker government could not show progress on these critical areas.

Akhtar said that the government’s ability to service public debt was hampered by weak tax collection, rising losses of SOEs and the highest interest rate since 1972.

She added that measures taken over the last few months had restored market confidence and led to a pick-up in economic activity. The GDP growth accelerated to 2.1% in the first quarter after two consecutive quarters of negative growth.

The finance minister pointed out that the removal of import ban and other import restrictions eased supply constraints, leading to an increase in economic activity.

The second quarter data is showing a stronger performance by the manufacturing sector, with large-scale manufacturing posting an 8.2% growth.

“We expect second-quarter GDP growth to rise to around 3% on stronger manufacturing output and higher production of crops including cotton, which has increased by 75% to 8.35 million bales,” Akhtar said.

She was of the view that difficult and unpopular measures including a reduction in subsidy on power and gas through timely implementation of quarterly tariffs helped improve primary accounts. No supplementary grants were released during that period and the PSDP projects that fell within the provincial domain were transferred to the provincial development programmes.

The finance minister acknowledged that the headline inflation had remained persistently high, but hoped for a significant decline in 2024 due to the measures taken by the caretaker government including the improvement in imports of raw material, higher food production and stability in exchange rate.

The government has cut its inflation forecast to 25.5% and it also sees economic instability “fading” away but said that the overall economic outlook still suffered from the restricting monetary and fiscal policies.

In its economic outlook, the Ministry of Finance stated that inflation may remain around 24.5% to 25.5% in February 2024, a forecast that is 2% less than its previous projection. It also expected lower inflation in March, projecting it in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%.

The inflation outlook for the upcoming month points towards a downward trajectory owing to better crops and smooth supply of commodities.

For the current fiscal year, the government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) have set the inflation target at 21%, which may be missed with a huge margin.

The finance ministry said that in February there was an increase in the administered prices of petrol and diesel. Despite the upward adjustment in transport expenses and gas prices, the inflation outlook for the upcoming month may have a downward trend, primarily due to a decrease in prices of perishable items on the back of better crops and ease in supplies, it added.

A high base effect will further contribute to keeping the inflationary pressure reduced.

The report pointed out that the foreign exchange reserves held by the SBP again slipped below $8 billion, standing at $7.9 billion as of last week.

There was also over 21% reduction in foreign direct investment despite efforts made by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). The finance ministry said that foreign direct investment decreased to $690 million in the current fiscal year, down by $187 million, or 21.4%.

The report pointed out that China had withdrawn some investment from the power sector. “In January 2024, the foreign direct investment witnessed a huge outflow of $173 million owing to the pulling out of investment aggressively from power projects, mainly by China.”

Chinese power plants are facing liquidity problems due to Pakistan’s failure to release their dues of Rs493 billion as of end-January.

2,Exports to China jump 44.53% in 7 months,Pakistan’s exports to other countries witnessed increase of 9.32% in first seven months,"Pakistan’s export of goods and services to China witnessed an increase of 44.53% during the first seven months of the current fiscal year (2023-24) as compared to the exports of the corresponding period of last year, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported.

The data revealed that overall exports to China were recorded at $1726.679 million during July-January (2023-24) against that of $1194.639 million the year before. On a YoY basis, exports to China also surged by 79.54% from $136.551 million in January 2023, against exports of $245.169 million in January 2024. However, on a MoM basis, exports to China fell by 4.96% during January 2024 against $257.978 million recorded in December 2023, the SBP report stated.

3,US encourages cooperation with IMF,State Department spokesperson says policies over next few months are crucial for financial stability,"The United States (US) supports Pakistan’s efforts to “break free” from the vicious cycle of debt and financing, a State Department spokesperson has said, urging the new government to continue working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global financial institutions.

“Pakistan’s new government must immediately prioritise the economic situation because the policies over the next several months will be crucial to maintaining economic stability for Pakistanis,” Spokesperson Mathew Miller told his daily news briefing on Wednesday.

The spokesperson was responding to a question at the daily State Department briefing about a letter sent by ex-Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan to the IMF, suggesting that the next loan facility be linked to an audit of the February 8 general elections in the country.

“I’ll just say, with respect to the IMF, that we support Pakistan’s efforts to break free from the vicious cycle of debt and international financing,” the spokesperson said. “The long-term health of Pakistan’s government – or economy is crucial to its stability,” Miller added.

Pakistan has been facing financial challenges in recent years, with dwindling foreign exchange reserves and declining value of its national currency.

Previously, the PTI had asked the IMF to factor in the country’s political stability in any further bailout talks, it emerged on Wednesday.

Read US wants Pakistan to continue working with IMF
Addressing a news conference in Islamabad, PTI stalwart Barrister Gohar Ali Khan confirmed that the party had sent a letter to the IMF, adding that it would reveal its content after it reached Washington.

Giving hints of what the letter might read, Gohar said the PTI had reminded the IMF of its promise that transparent elections would be held in Pakistan. However, The Express Tribune has obtained a copy of the letter. Addressed to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, in the letter, PTI claimed that it did not want to stand in the way of any global lender’s facility for Pakistan.

However, the party stressed the need for the necessary reforms along with the facility to facilitate the repayment of the loans.

“The IMF can negotiate only with an elected government that has the confidence of the people,” it stated. The party urged the Washington-based lender to take into account its policy guidance note prepared in 1997.

“It is a well-established reality that a government without legitimate representation, when imposed upon a country, carries no moral authority to govern, and, in particular, carry out taxation measures.”

4,Rupee stabilises near 279,China’s rollover of $2b loan signals market confidence,"The Pakistani rupee is showing signs of stability, hovering slightly over Rs279 against the US dollar in the interbank market, even as the country's foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) slipped to below $8 billion, a two-month low.

According to SBP’s data, the domestic currency ticked up by Rs0.01, closing at an over four-month high at Rs279.11 against the greenback on Thursday.

Over the past five and a half months, the currency has cumulatively gained 10% or Rs28, compared to all-time low hit of Rs307.10/$ recorded in the first week of September 2023.

The currency has been moving in a narrow band between Rs279-280/$ for a little more than a month, suggesting that the rupee may be moving towards stabilisation at its current levels.

Additionally, the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported that the rupee remained unchanged at Rs282.04/$ for the third straight working day in the open market.

The country’s foreign exchange reserves (held by SBP) dropped by $63 million on foreign debt repayment, slipping to a two-month low at $7.85 billion in the week ended February 23, 2024, according to the central bank’s weekly update on Thursday.

Meanwhile, the Caretaker Finance Minister Shamshad Akhtar confirmed to Reuters that China has rolled over $2 billion deposits at SBP. This development puts an end to the speculation in the currency markets that the government was arranging financing to pay off the huge sum to Beijing in March 2024.

However, it is important to note that the reserves provide import cover for less than two months.

Earlier, the reserves were maintained at above $8 billion in the past eight consecutive weeks, despite little fluctuation due to official inflows and outflows. However, for the second successive week, the reserves have maintained a downturn on foreign debt repayments, according to the central bank.

On the other hand, the foreign exchange reserves held by commercial banks remained stable at $5.08 billion on a week-on-week basis.

Accordingly, the country's total foreign exchange reserves stood at $13.03 billion in the week under review.

5,"Sindh govt, World Bank to invest $100m in renewables",Aim to generate around 300MW of electricity through various energy projects,"The Sindh government is collaborating with the World Bank to set up renewable energy projects in solar and wind equipment, aiming to protect the environment from greenhouse gases and Pakistan from recurrent natural disasters.

Speaking at a seminar titled ‘Significance of Renewable for Karachi & Export Industry: Cost of Inaction’, Director of Alternative Energy for the Sindh Government, Mehfooz Qazi, stated, “The Sindh government will invest $100 million in renewable energy projects in collaboration with the World Bank.”

Around 300 megawatts (MW) of electricity will be generated with World Bank funding, which will include wind and solar power, he said at the summit organised by Renewables First in collaboration with PRIDE (Policy Research Institute for Equitable Development) in Karachi on Thursday.

The government of Sindh is working to set up 500 MW solar power projects, 400 MW hydrogen power projects, and waste-to-energy projects, Qazi said.

These environmentally friendly power projects are the need of the time to save the country from natural disasters, he said, adding that they are also good sources of providing low-cost energy, which is another requirement of the time in Pakistan, which has been fighting against high inflation for the past couple of years.

Qazi said the Sindh government has developed a policy of providing affordable land for alternative energy projects. The provincial government is already acquiring a significant amount of energy from such renewable projects.

He also mentioned that the Sindh government and K-Electric are collaborating on several alternative energy projects. KE set up two projects of 25MW each in the Hub area three years ago. The Karachi-based private energy firm is harnessing wind energy from the wind corridor located in Gharo in the province.

Sharing findings of a study titled ‘Examining KE’s Cost of Inaction in Deploying Renewables’, Hammad Ali, an analyst at Renewables First specialising in the power market, said, “KE’s generation fleet is heavily dependent on thermal power generation. Timely decisions (on renewable energy projects) by KE can still save up to $4.51 billion in the next seven years.”

Read ‘Three waste-to-energy projects to be launched’
He mentioned that previous decisions by the Karachi-based power utility company to procure thermal generation sources instead of cheaper renewable alternatives had resulted in losses of over $250 million in terms of the cost of missed opportunities.

Former NEPRA chairman, Tauseef Farooqi said that the latest license given to KE is non-exclusive, and any private entity can now enter the market in Karachi as a competitor.

He emphasised that KE should have been unbundled from the very first day because generation, transmission, and distribution are three very different departments that require separate attention.

He regretted that there was absolutely zero planning in Pakistan’s power sector before the introduction of Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan a few years ago.

Speaking of the potential of renewables in lowering costs for ordinary consumers and industrial users alike, he stressed that the country and utilities must now move towards a competitive, transparent, and open market mechanism as proposed under the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contracts Market

Programme Director of Net Zero Pakistan, Somanul Haq, said his organisation is a coalition of industries committed to net zero emissions by the end of 2050.

He further highlighted that the export industry in Pakistan is increasingly coming under pressure from global supply chains, and there is growing demand for Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) in the country, with 300GWh to be sold this year alone.

He said companies in Pakistan are shutting down every day due to more and more expensive fuels and unfavourable conditions.

6,"Political clarity tosses stocks above 64,500","KSE-100 index surges 875.07 points, settles at 64,578.52","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday extended its bullish run from the previous session as buoyant investors resorted to hefty buying over the commencement of formal legislative proceedings, propelling the KSE-100 index higher by over 870 points.

Earlier, the trading session kicked off with a spike as the newly elected members of National Assembly (NA) were sworn in after President Dr Arif Alvi approved the holding of first post-poll session of the lower house of parliament at the eleventh hour.

Despite reservations, the president called the NA session to put an end to speculations, which eased political uncertainty, bolstered investor confidence and provided an opportunity to the market to post growth.

Besides clarity on the political front, China agreed on a $2 billion debt rollover on existing terms after initially seeking a price hike. This further boosted the stock market.

The bourse sustained the uptrend throughout the day and touched the intra-day high of 64,801.63 points in the second half. In addition, rupee stability also helped the index surge past the 64,500 barrier.

“Stocks closed bullish after the president summoned NA session for setting up the new government, which eased political noise,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.

“Easing political uncertainty, rupee stability and rollover of $2 billion of Chinese debt played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.”

At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a surge of 875.07 points, or 1.37%, and settled at 64,578.52.
Topline Securities, in its report, said a positive session was observed at the PSX where the index extended the previous day’s gains.

“This positivity can be attributed to the maiden session of the 16th National Assembly where the newly elected representatives took oath. This increased investor confidence as the country headed towards fulfilling the democratic process where the new government will take charge,” it said.

Major positive contribution to the index came from Engro Fertilisers, Millat Tractors, Pakistan Petroleum, Hub Power, United Bank and Meezan Bank as they cumulatively contributed 516 points, Topline added.

Arif Habib Limited (AHL) remarked that the KSE-100 gained 4.19% month-on-month and finally moved through 64,000 to the new target of 65,300.

“According to the Ministry of Finance, the Consumer Price Index is expected to ease to 23.5%-24.5% in March, due to a decrease in prices of perishable items on the back of better crop yields and smooth supplies with a high base effect,” it said.

For March, the index should see new record highs above 67,000 with support in the 63k-64k zone, AHL added.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal said the market opened positive where major investor interest was seen in cement, banking and exploration and production sectors.

“Political clarity was the key reason for the positive sentiment,” he said. “Going forward, we recommend investors to view any downtrend as an opportunity to buy stocks in cement, banking and oil sectors,” the analyst added.

Overall trading volumes decreased to 424.04 million shares against Wednesday’s tally of 461.4 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs17.05 billion.

Shares of 364 companies were traded. Of these, 188 stocks closed higher, 161 dropped and 15 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 54.96 million shares, gaining Rs0.11 to close at Rs4.90. It was followed by Hascol Petroleum with 31.9 million shares, gaining Rs0.03 to close at Rs8.01 and Kohinoor Spinning Mills with 19.8 million shares, gaining Rs0.01 to close at Rs4.69.

Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs1.15 billion, according to the NCCPL.

7,Alvi advocates for global recognition of pink salt,"Calls for value addition, sustainable mining, tourism at Khewra Salt Mines","President Dr Arif Alvi, on Thursday, underlined the need to project pink salt as a Pakistani product in potential global markets after its value addition in line with the international standards.

“A significant amount of foreign exchange can be earned by adding value to the local raw salt and making various products,” he said during his visit to the Khewra salt mines.

He also emphasised the need to utilise modern technology to minimise the loss of salt during the mining process besides adopting atmosphere friendly and responsible mining ways. He highlighted that Pakistan had huge reserves of high quality rock salt which was low cost and full of minerals. The president also reviewed the tourist places inside the salt mine.

8,Alibaba Cloud announces steep price cut,"It's most severe price cut to date, amid intensifying competition to attract heavy users","China’s Alibaba Cloud on Thursday said it will slash prices of some of its products by as much as 55%, its most severe price cut to date, amid intensifying competition to attract heavy users, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) software developers.

This would be the second time the cloud arm of Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding has cut prices in less than a year after reductions of as much as 50% in April.

The cloud service provider said it would lower prices of over 100 products by an average of 20%. The price cuts constitute Alibaba’s latest effort to persuade developers to build data-intensive AI models and applications using its cloud services.

Rivals including Tencent Holdings and Huawei Technologies, which also cut cloud prices last year following Alibaba’s lead, have offered a number of promotions to convince tech companies to develop AI within their ecosystems.

Alibaba Cloud currently serves about one-third of the local market.

An industry analyst said that Alibaba’s price-cutting exercise this time is more aggressive than usual, showing the company’s focus on courting customers. “The discount even applies to the undelivered orders for existing customers. This is seen as breaking the norm,” he said.
