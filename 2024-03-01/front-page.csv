• 302 lawmakers take oath amid noisy protests by opposition lawmakers, supporters
• Ayaz Sadiq to contest NA speaker poll against Amir Dogar backed by PTI
ISLAMABAD: Three weeks after the general elections, the National Assembly held its inaugural session on Thursday amid noisy protests from both sides of the aisle, as 302 lawmakers took the oath of office on its first day.
The session started at 11:14am with outgoing speaker Pervaiz Ashraf in the chair. At the outset, PTI leader Amir Dogar led a group of lawmakers into the house wearing facemasks resembling Imran Khan and carrying portraits demanding the release of the PTI founder. They surrounded the dais of the speaker and shouted slogans for over an hour prompting the PML-N and PPP lawmakers to respond by doing the same.
 
 

The PTI MNAs were chanting slogans like ‘release Imran Khan’, ‘prisoner number 804’, ‘who will save Pakistan: Imran Khan, Imran Khan’, and ‘fake mandate and thieves are not accepted’ etc. On the other hand, PML-N leaders waved a wristwatch — a reference to the Toshakhana case against Imran Khan.
 






The press gallery was also not immune from unrest, as some PTI supporters managed to sneak into the gallery and raise slogans against Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif.
They were, however, shown out of the hall by the assembly staff. The supporters of the political parties in the VIP gallery were also involved in sloganeering.

Similarly, a PML-N supporter, reportedly son of a late PML-N leader from Murree, was seen raising slogans against PTI founder Imran Khan. He was expelled from the house on the complaint of PTI MNAs sitting in the front row.
PPP leaders Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Asif Ali Zardari separately entered the house as Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari sat in the VIP gallery.
As Asif Zardari entered the hall, the PTI supporters greeted him with ‘Mr 10 per cent’ jibes. The PPP supporters responded with ‘aik Zardari sab pay bhari’.
Similarly, Nawaz Sharif and PM-designate Shehbaz Sharif came to the house together and were warmly welcomed by those sitting on the treasury benches. They were also met with slogans from the PTI supporters.
Oaths and signatures
After the lawmakers were administered the oath, they were asked to sign the roll of members, a register newly elected lawmakers are supposed to sign after taking the oath. PML-N’s Ayaz Sadiq — being the speaker nominee — was the first one to sign his name.

Due to the protest of PTI lawmakers surrounding the speaker’s dais, former president Zardari faced some difficulty in approaching the podium. PPP lawmakers, however, made a human shield around him to facilitate his signature.
The PML-N lawmakers followed the same method to shield Nawaz and Shehbaz from the protest and they were taken to the speaker’s dais for the required procedure.
On this occasion, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz also reached the VIP gallery to witness the oath-taking of the MNA. She also faced slogans.

Aleem Khan, a former PTI leader, was called a turncoat by the protesters as he arrived to sign his roll of member.
In contrast, almost all PTI lawmakers chanted slogans in favour of Imran Khan before scratching their signatures. They went to the speaker’s dais and raised the portrait of Mr Khan before signing their name.
After the signatures, Speaker Ashraf gave the floor to Omar Ayub who complained that many of the detained leaders and returned candidates of the PTI were in jail and were not produced in the NA session.
“One of our woman leaders Aliya Hamza (who lost election to Hamza Shehbaz) is still behind bars,” he added.
 






PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali said his party had won 180 seats according to Forms-45, but its mandate was stolen.
He said that under Article 51, the election of the speaker and the deputy speaker could not be held with an ‘incomplete’ house.
He said the Sunni Ittehad Council has been deprived of 23 seats, including 20 reserved seats for women and three reserved for non-Muslims.
The speaker also allowed PML-N leader Khawaja Asif to speak on the floor of the house but the opposition started shouting giving him no chance to speak.
PTI-backed MNA Jamshed Dasti used “abusive language” during the speech.
In response, Khawaja Asif removed his wristwatch and brandished it to tease his opponents — a reference to the Toshakhana case. PTI-backed Amir Dogar told people sitting in the VIP gallery that the opposition would not allow the government to make any legislation throughout its term.
Speaker, deputy speaker’s election
The National Assembly issued a notification regarding the election of the speaker and deputy speaker which is taking place today (Friday) at 10am while the election for the office of prime minister will be held on Sunday.
Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Ghulam Mustafa Shah are the joint candidates of the allied parties for the office of the speaker and deputy speaker, respectively.
PTI-backed lawmaker Amir Dogar is the joint candidate for the slot of the NA speaker and Junaid Akbar is their candidate for the office of the deputy speaker.
Interestingly, PPP leader Yousuf Raza Gilani lost his Senate seat after taking the oath as the MNA. The lawmaker cannot hold two offices simultaneously.
Earlier, it was believed that Mr Gilani would be the joint candidate of the coalition for the Senate chairman slot, but after taking oath as the MNA he ceased to be a senator.
PPP sources earlier said Mr Gilani would join the Senate in the election expected to be held in March and then he will be able to contest for the office of the chairman.
Composition of coalition
The potential ruling coalition consists of eight political parties: the PML-N with 108 seats, PPP with 68 seats, MQM-Pakistan with 22 seats, PML-Q with four seats, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party with four seats, Balochistan Awami Party, PML-Zia, and National Party with one seat each.
In total, the coalition has 209 seats so far. It may be noted that Ijazul Haq of PML-Z had joined the PTI in March 2023.
The joint opposition has five political parties. The Sunni Ittehad Council has 91 seats, JUI-F has eight seats, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen, Balochistan National Party, and the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party have one seat each. The total strength of the opposition is 104 members at the present.

1,Gwadar declared calamity-hit; forecast puts Sindh govt on edge,"Rain emergency declared in Sindh, Friday to be half-day; 100mm of rain expected in Karachi, temperature may drop to 13-15 degrees.","

• Rain emergency declared in Sindh, Friday to be half-day
• 100mm of rain expected in Karachi, temperature may drop to 13-15 degrees today
• Downpour may arrive after 2pm, likely to continue for 12 hours with frequent gaps
KARACHI / GWADAR: The fourth-time PPP government in Sindh, haunted by its past poor performance during rains, faces its first challenge today (Friday), with the Met Office predicting two days of moderate to heavy downpours in many parts of the province.
Meanwhile, the Balochistan government on Thursday declared Gwadar a calamity-hit area after heavy rains battered the district, suspending normal life and traffic.
The weather forecast for Sindh has kept the provincial administration on its toes, prompting it to announce a rain emergency in the province, declare Friday a half-day, and advise citizens against unnecessarily stepping out of their homes.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department repeated its forecast on Thursday, predicting “rain with winds and thunderstorms” in Karachi, Sukkur, Jacobabad, Kashmore, Larkana, Dadu, Shaheed Benazirabad, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Khairpur and Mirpurkhas on Friday and possibly on Saturday.
A Met Office advisory said Karachi is likely to experience cloudy weather with intermittent thunderstorms and rain on Friday, with a few heavy falls that may generate urban flooding in some areas.
It said the temperature is likely to drop to 13-15 degrees Celsius on Friday and 10-12 degrees on Saturday in the city. Similar weather conditions are likely to prevail in other parts of the province under the influence of a westerly wave over Balochistan.
This weather forecast follows the recent devastation caused by similar weather conditions in Gwadar and other coastal areas of Balochistan.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, on his second day in office, summoned a meeting at Chief Minister House, where the officials from the city administration, relief organisations, disaster management bodies and civic institutions discussed the approaching challenge and devised a strategy.
“In view of the rain emergency in Karachi, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has declared Friday a half-day for all government and private offices. In addition, all local bodies, hospitals, water board, Karachi Electric (KE) and cantonments have been instructed to be prepared to handle any situation,” said a statement issued by Chief Minister House after the meeting.
The urgency of these preparations stems from the traumatic experiences of the most recent rains, which occurred just days before the Feb 8 elections and badly hit Karachi’s infrastructure,
100mm rain expected in Karachi
Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab, citing the Met Office, highlighted the potential for up to 100 millimetres of rain in the city.
“The information suggests that the downpour may hit Karachi after 2pm and continue for 12 hours with frequent gaps,” Mr Wahab told Dawn. “In case of heavy rain, we may receive 30mm to 32mm of rain in one go. So, we are doing our best and making all precautionary measures utilising all available resources.”
At the CM House meeting, Chief Minister Shah directed all the town chairpersons to be alert in their areas and look after their stormwater and sewerage systems. He directed Chief Secretary Dr Fakhre Alam to coordinate police support for district administrations in case of heavy rain.
Among directives to officials, there was also a suggestion for the people. “The Pakistan Meteorological Department has issued a forecast stating that there will be rain and thunderstorms from the night of Feb 29, 2024, until the morning of March 2, 2024. This rainfall could be heavy, so residents are advised to prepare themselves accordingly,” the CM House statement said.
Later in the evening, the provincial government announced setting up a rain emergency cell at Chief Minister House for “better coordination and effective execution of plan”.
“The cell would coordinate with administrations of the affected districts and report to the chief minister every few hours,” the CM House said in a statement.
Additionally, the education department has announced closures for evening shifts in schools, colleges, and universities across Sindh on Friday.
Besides, the University of Karachi rescheduled its exams from March 1 to March 7, and Commissioner Karachi postponed the fifth city marathon in DHA Phase VIII and announced March 8 as the new date.
The crisis-handling moves from the government, officials said, came with “unusual weather conditions.” They were “surprised” that such an “intense and strong” rain system was never witnessed before in February and March.
Unusual weather
Dr Sardar Sarfaraz, chief meteorologist at the Pakistan Meteorological Department, was cautious about attributing this unusual weather pattern to climate change, but acknowledged its rarity and potential impact.
Linking the current phenomenon to climate change “needs to be proven through data, post-event study and scientific evidence, which would take time”, he said.
“But, definitely, it’s unusual. We have never witnessed such a massive and intense impact of westerly waves in February or March before like we are recording in Gwadar and other Balochistan towns. After weakening in Balochistan, the same system is moving to Karachi and other parts of Sindh,” he said.
Dr Sarfaraz said the fresh rain system was likely to stay for 12 to 18 hours in Karachi and expected to fizzle out from Sindh by Saturday evening. However, he warned, it would cause a brief spell of cold waves for a few days and might bring the night temperature down to single digits in Karachi.
Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has directed the Sindh government to play a full and effective role in preparation for possible rains in the province.
According to a press release issued by the media cell at Bilawal House on Thursday, the PPP chairman instructed all members of the Sindh Assembly and elected representatives of his party to play an active role in addressing the rain emergency.
Gwadar declared calamity-hit
Caretaker Balochistan Information Minister Jan Achakzai, who announced the government’s decision to declare Gwadar a calamity-hit area, said heavy rains with hailstorms continued to lash the district.
Hundreds of people affected by rains have protested in Gwadar against the provincial administration, alleging that it was not doing enough to shift citizens to safe areas. The heavy downpour has practically left many people homeless in the affected areas, as their houses either collapsed or inundated.
In Gwadar city, protesters blocked Marine Drive and other roads. Haq Do Tehreek leaders Maulana Hidayatur Rehman Baloch and Hussain Wadila reached the site and joined the protesters.
“We have no other option but to dig roads to dewater the area. Continuous rains are creating hurdles in relief operations in Gwadar and other rain-affected areas,” a senior official of the Gwadar district administration told Dawn by phone, adding that the roads and streets of Gwadar were flooded with rainwater.

2,"Petrol price jumps by Rs4, diesel unchanged",Petrol now at Rs279.75 per litre while high-speed diesel kept unchanged at Rs287.33 per litre.,"ISLAMABAD: In its last fuel price revision announcement before farewell, the caretaker government on Thursday increased the petrol price by Rs4.13 per litre for the next fortnight ending March 15 but left the price of high-speed diesel unchanged.
In a late-night an­­nouncement, the Ministry of Finance announced the new prices for the next fortnight, starting from March 1, as recommended by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
 






The petrol price has gone up by 1.5 per cent with immediate effect to Rs279.75 per litre from Rs275.62 earlier. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and an increase in its price directly impacts the budget of middle- and lower-middle classes.
The price of high-speed diesel was kept unchanged at Rs287.33 per litre. Since this fuel is mostly used by the transport sector, a hike in its price is considered inflationary. The fuel is used in heavy vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
The government did not announce the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil. Kerosene is mostly used by unscrupulous elements, who mix it with petrol, and to some extent for lighting and heating in remote areas. Light diesel oil is consumed by flour mills and a couple of power plants.
 
 

In the international market, the prices of both major petroleum products — petrol and high-speed diesel — moved slightly both ways (10 to 50 cents per barrel) over the past fortnight, with the Pakistan State Oil (PSO) paying higher import premiums on petrol. Meanwhile, the US dollar lost about 15 paise against the rupee on Feb 28.
The price of petrol has gone up to $90.78 from $89.20 per barrel over the last two weeks, while that of high-speed diesel edged lower by about eight cents per barrel to $101.05 from about $101.13.
However, the rupee generally remained stable. The premium paid by PSO for securing product cargoes went up slightly for petrol to $10.45 per barrel this fortnight from $9.47. It remained unchanged for high-speed diesel at $6.5 per barrel.
Petroleum and electricity prices have been the key drivers of a high Consumer Price Index-based inflation, recorded at 28.3pc in January. The seven-month average inflation increased to 28.7pc from 25.4pc in the same period last year.
At present, the government is charging about Rs82 per litre tax on both petrol and high-speed diesel. Although the general sales tax is zero on all petroleum products, the government charges Rs60 per litre petroleum development levy on both products.
The government also charges about Rs17-20 per litre customs duty on petrol and high-speed diesel.
On the other hand, it is charging Rs50 per litre tax on high-octane blending component and 95 research octane number (RON) petrol.
Petrol and high-speed diesel are the major revenue spinners for the government, with their monthly sales hovering at 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene.

3,PTI notifies office bearers ahead of schedule after ‘no contest’,"Gohar, Omar Ayub to be party chairman and secretary general, respectively, after their rivals ""withdraw"" papers.","ISLAMABAD: In a late-night development, PTI announced that Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Omar Ayub were elected the party’s chairman and general secretary, respectively, after their opponents withdrew nomination papers.
Similarly, provincial presidents of Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapters were also announced. An election will now only be held to elect the Balochistan chapter president.
In Balochistan, three candidates, Amin Khan Jogazai, Dawood Shah, and Munir Ahmed Baloch, will contest the election on March 3.
 
 

PTI was set to hold intra-party elections on March 3, for which a number of leaders submitted their nomination papers as panels.

Gohar, Omar to be chariman and secy general, respectively, after their rivals ‘withdraw’ papers

But a majority of those leaders withdrew nomination papers only two days before the election, PTI’s Federal Election Commi­ssioner Raoof Hasan told Dawn.
In the absence of opponents on most seats, he was left with no option but to notify the unopposed winners.
According to a notice issued by Mr Hasan and seen by Dawn, there was only one candidate each for the posts of chairman; secretary general; and Punjab, KP and Sindh presidents.
“There shall be no polling for the stated five positions. Polling shall take place only in Quetta for the election of President Balochistan Panel,” the notice said, adding that the federal election commissioner will declare the final result on March 3.
As per the final list, signed by Mr Hasan and available with Dawn, Yasmin Rashid, Ali Amin Gandapur and Haleem Adil Sheikh were elected presidents of PTI’s Punjab, KP and Sindh chapters, respectively.
For the March 3 election, Mr Gohar was the only leader to have submitted his candidature for the top post. Mr Ayub, along with a 15-member panel, had submitted nomination papers for the position of general secretary.
In Punjab, Dr Rashid, who is currently in prison, was Mr Khan’s nominee to lead the party’s provincial chapter. So was Mr Sheikh in Sindh, Dr Baloch in Balochistan and Mr Gandapur in KP.
The victory of Mr Khan-backed candidates was guaranteed anyway, but to meet ECP’s requirement and avoid any unopposed election, rival panels also submitted nomination papers.

4,"Developer admits arranging £5,000 for ex-judge Mazahar Naqvi’s daughter","Witness testifies Justice Naqvi did not repay the amount; SJC told judge’s sons were allotted plots in Islamabad, Lahore at concessional rates.","ISLAMABAD: A leading developer, Zahid Rafiq, on Thursday conceded before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) he had arranged £5,000 for the daughter of Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, a retired judge of the Supreme Court facing references for misconduct.
Mr Rafiq, who owns eight to ten companies including Lahore Smart City (Pvt) Ltd, Capital City (Pvt) Ltd and Future Development Holding (Pvt) Ltd, informed the SJC he was told the money was needed to meet an emergency. He arranged the funds through one of his friends in the United Arab Emirates.
 
 

Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, the five-member SJC held proceedings against Justice Naqvi, facing ten references even after his resignation on Jan 10.
The prosecution witness said the judge did not repay the amount and his company made an adjustment from the accounts of Mohammad Safdar Khan, also a businessman and another witness in the case.

Witness testifies Justice Naqvi did not repay the amount; SJC told judge’s sons were allotted plots in Islamabad, Lahore at concessional rates

Mr Safdar, who provided land to Smart City, had purchased from the former judge a house situated in Gulberg, Lahore, measuring two kanals and four marlas for Rs130 million. He, however, committed to providing documents on Friday about the running accounts maintained by his company in favour of Mr Safdar.
The witness was not sure about arranging in 2022 any booking in the Montcalm Royal London House for ten days for Tasadduq Mustafa Naqvi, the son of the former judge.
Mr Rafiq said he was introduced to the former judge by Mr Safdar about five years ago, who took him to the latter’s GOR Lahore residence. He also attended the marriage ceremony of one of his sons, though he never met any other judges of the superior courts.
Allotment of plots
On April 16, 2019, his company allotted a 500-square-yard plot each to the two sons of the judge at Capital Smart City Islam­abad at a concessional rate. The sons deposited a down payment out of ten payments, totalling Rs5.4 million each.
 
 

However, the witness added, the balance amount has not been paid to date. Yet, the company transferred the plots in the names of the judge’s sons. The witness provided documents to this effect.
When he said the allotments were made at the request of Mr Safdar, the CJP quipped, was Mr Safdar doling out sadqa (charity) from the owner’s pocket, or blackmailing him.
Mr Rafiq replied that he usually favours friends, explaining that Mr Safdar has been working with him for the last ten years, helping to buy lands for different projects on his behalf.
He stated that two commercial plots of 100sqyds each were also allotted to the judge’s sons in Lahore by the Lahore Smart City at a concessional rate of 10pc when the total land cost was Rs8m each, that too on Mr Safdar’s request. Subsequently, these commercial plots were transferred into the names of the sons, who later sold them.
The witness produced March 19, 2019 letters issued by Future Development Holdings in favour of Tasadduq Mustafa Naqvi who was appointed legal adviser of the company on a monthly salary of Rs150,000 with the condition that he will not work for any other organisation.
When quizzed why his company paid Rs50m to Chaudhry Mohammad Shahbaz, who had sold four kanals — 100 Sant Jones Park property — to the former judge in Lahore, he explained he was requested by Mr Safdar to pay the money to Mr Shahbaz since Mr Safdar was a debtor of his company. When asked was it a practice of issuing such a huge amount to someone else, he said he had no idea, adding that his staff might have committed a mistake.
The CJP, however, observed that the witness had attributed everything to Mr Safdar.
Earlier, Mr Shahbaz and Masood Khan, the branch operations manager of Islamic Banking at Askari Bank Gulberg Lahore, also presented their testimonies before the court.
While concluding proceedings, the CJP reiterated that anyone wishing to cross-examine the witnesses on behalf of Justice Naqvi may do so; otherwise, the testimonies would go un-rebutted.
Naqvi’s fresh letter
Justice Naqvi again wrote a letter to the SJC secretary, stating he would not be participating in the council’s proceedings. However, he said he reserved his right to address his grievances at the right and relevant forums, if and when the occasion arises.
The letter regretted that all his earlier correspondence had been ignored and disregarded by the SJC, and on many occasions, the facts of the proceedings were allegedly misstated in the minutes of the meetings.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati swears in Suraiya Bibi as deputy speaker.—INP / Handout

• Gandapur to contest against PML-N’s Ibadullah in KP; PPP yet to nominate Balochistan CM candidate
• Babar Saleem Swati becomes KP Assembly speaker; Abdul Khaliq Achakzai bags Balochistan speaker slot unopposed
QUETTA / PESHAWAR: After electing custodians of the house on Thursday, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan lawmakers will respectively elect their leader of the house in the election for the chief minister on Friday and Saturday.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the PTI has nominated Ali Amin Gandapur for the coveted slot against PML-N candidate Ibadullah Khan, with the polling scheduled for 10am.
 
 

In Balochistan, the PPP which is eyeing the CM seat unopposed has yet to name its nominee, with only a day left in the election. A source told Dawn that the candidate would be announced today (Friday), hoping the PPP CM would get elected unopposed like the Balochistan Assembly speaker.
 






As the KP Assembly met on Thursday, it elected Babar Saleem Swati as the speaker and Suraiya Bibi as the deputy speaker. Although the session was relatively calm, pro-Imran slogans continued to echo in the house throughout the session.
At the outset of the session, outgoing speaker Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani administered the oath to Abdul Munim and Laiq Khan. The ceremony was followed by voting for the KP Assembly speaker.
The PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) candidate Babar Saleem Swati won the election against Ehsanullah Khan, the joint candidate of the PPP, ANP, PML-N, and the PTI-Parliamentarians.
In the 106-strong house, Mr Swati bagged 89 votes whereas Mr Khan got 17 votes. Mushtaq Ghani administered the oath to newly-elected speaker Swati, who announced voting for the deputy speaker slot. Suraiya Bibi, who won the election from Chitral on a general seat, defeated PTI-P’s Arbab Muhammad Waseem by securing 87 votes against her rival’s 19 votes.
The session was boycotted by the JUI-F.
During the session, a similar situation like Wednesday was seen during the sitting when PTI workers kept chanting pro-Imran Khan slogans from treasury benches.
They also chanted slogans against PML-N’s Sobia Shahid on the second day during the voting of the KP Assembly speaker. Ms Shahid later brandished her shoe at the guest gallery and reached out to the CM-designate Ali Amin Gandapur, who stood up and asked his supporters to calm down.
Balochistan speaker elected unopposed
 

Balochistan Assembly Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai administers the oath to Ghazala Gola as deputy speaker.—INP / Handout

In Balochistan, PML-N nominee Abdul Khaliq Achakzai became the speaker while PPP’s Ghazala Gola bagged the deputy speaker slot without facing any opposition.
Mr Achakzai was nominated by the PML-N for the slot at the eleventh hour. Both candidates were declared winners unopposed as no one else had submitted papers for the posts.
The assembly session was presided over by Zamrak Khan Piralizai, who administered oath to the newly-elected speaker. Speaker Achakzai subsequently announced the election of Ghazala Gola unopposed and administered the oath to the deputy speaker.
As oath was being administered to the speaker, National Party chief Dr Abdul Malik, along with three others, walked out of the house. He said he was boycotting the proceedings because the elections were rigged.
After the unopposed election, Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai assured the house that the proceedings of the assembly would be run with consultation and cooperation of all the members and parties. “As custodian of the house, I will treat every member equally and will run the house through cooperation and understanding with all members,” he assured.
He, however, expressed his reservation about the boycott of oath-taking of the speaker and deputy speaker by the National Party.
Interestingly, former interior minister Sarfaraz Bugti was administered oath on Thursday after he skipped Wednesday’s proceedings. The PML-N’s Jam Kamal Alyani and Mir Zafar Zehri did not attend the session.
