0,Pakistan rejects foreign poll probe demand,Islamabad says election is an internal matter,"The Foreign Office on Friday said no country could give directions to Pakistan to investigate the allegations of rigging in the Feb 8 general elections, insisting that the country believed in “sovereign right” to make decisions about its internal matters.
“Pakistan is a vibrant democracy and there are mechanisms in place inside Pakistan where Pakistani people can resolve any issue pertaining to questions relating to elections or any issue relating to the democratic process in Pakistan,” the FO spokesperson remarked at the weekly briefing.

Mumtaz Zahra Baloch was responding to a question about the US government’s repeated statements, asking Pakistan to probe into the ballot fraud.

“I believe no country can give directions to Pakistan. Pakistan is an independent and sovereign country. We believe in our own sovereign right to make decisions about Pakistan's internal affairs,” she added.

Besides the US government’s reaction, a number of US congressmen wrote a letter to the Biden administration urging the White House not to recognise the new government in Pakistan till election fraud allegations were probed.

“Yes, we understand that such a letter has been sent by some Congressmen to the US Secretary of State. This is a communication between public officials in the United States and is not addressed to the Government of Pakistan. We therefore have no comments to offer on such letters,” the spokesperson said.

Mumtaz also declined to comment on the letter written by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), requesting the Washington-based lender to negotiate only with a legitimate government.

On the arrest of four individuals believed to be Pakistanis for allegedly transporting weapons to Yemen from Iran, the spokesperson said Pakistan was in contact with the US authorities.

“We have seen the press release issued by the US Department of Justice indicating the said charges. We are in touch with the US Embassy in Islamabad and our Mission in Washington to ascertain more facts regarding the incident and to provide consular access to the individuals following confirmation of their nationality,” she added.

The suspects were detained on Jan 11 in an operation conducted by the US Navy Seals off the coast of Somalia in the Arabian Sea.

The main suspect identified as Muhammad Pehlwan was charged with transporting weapons to the Houthis in Yemen.
The other three were accused of giving false information.

The spokesperson said there were no basis for speculative reports that certain countries had already conveyed their concerns to Pakistan over its move to start work on the long delayed multibillion-dollar Iran gas pipeline project.

She confirmed that the Cabinet Committee on Energy had already made a decision regarding the Iran-Pakistan pipeline.
“Pakistan considers the Iran-Pakistan pipeline project as an important project that symbolises friendship between the two countries. Ensuring energy security remains a top priority for the Government of Pakistan and the Iran-Pakistan pipeline, among other projects, forms an important component of Pakistan's future energy mix,” she explained.

She said the Cabinet Committee on Energy had approved the recommendations to resume work on the 80-kilometre section of the pipeline, which was inside the Pakistani territory.

“And this is the latest development that I can share with you. I have seen certain media reports yesterday and I do not understand the basis of those reports so I would not like to comment on speculative reporting,” she said.

2,"Gohar, Ayub win PTI top slots unopposed","Yasmin Rashid, Ali Amin Gandapur, Haleem Shaikh elected uncontested as presidents of Punjab, K-P, Sindh, respectively","In a major development in the intra-party election of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Barrister Gohar Ali Khan was elected Chairman and Umar Ayub Secretary General unopposed, along with the leadership of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh on Thursday.

However, there is a three-way contest for the president of the party’s Balochistan chapter president, which would be held on March 3. According to the party officials, the final results would be announced on Sunday after the election in Balochistan.

The PTI would election its chairman, secretary general and four provincial chiefs through the intra-party elections on March 3. As per the election schedule, Thursday was the last day of withdrawal of candidates and panels for provinces.

At the end of that phase, PTI Federal Election Commissioner Raoof Hassan issued the final list of candidates for the posts of party chairman, central secretary-general, Punjab president panel, K-P president panel, Sindh president panel and Balochistan president panel.

“With Reference to the schedule of Intra-Party-Election issued on February 23, 2024, following is the revised final list of Panels/Candidates: 1. Chairman’s Election, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan; 2. Central Secretary General’s Panel, Omar Ayub Khan Panel; 3. Punjab President Panel, Dr Yasmin Rashid Panel; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa President Panel, Ali Amin Khan Gandapur Panel; 5. Sindh President Panel, Haleem Adil Sheikh Panel,” said a press release.

“With only one Candidate/Panel remaining as above, they have been declared elected unopposed by the respective Returning Officers,” said a press release. “There shall, therefore, be no polling at the above stated 5 places,” it added.

“Polling shall take place only at Quetta for the election of President Balochistan Panel,” the press release said, adding that in Baluchistan, the president panels in contest were: a) Amin Khan Jogazai Panel b) Dawood Shah Panel and c) Munir Ahmad Baloch Panel.

The press release announced that the final result of the election would be declared by the Federal Election Commissioner on March 3, 2024, at the conclusion of the election process.

The PTI is holding the intra-party elections after a long battle in the run-up to the February 8 general elections, when it was stripped of its electoral symbol of ‘bat’ by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), a decision endorsed by the Supreme Court.

Intra-party election is a required under the Election Act. The last elections were held in the PTI during June 2016 with the next elections due in June 2021. However, in response to ECP’s notice, the party stated that it had failed to hold the elections due to the COVID pandemic and asked for a year’s time.

The party conducted its elections on 8 June 2022, but the ECP refused to accept the elections. After long proceedings in the ECP, the PTI conducted the intra-party election again on December 2 2023. However, these elections were also challenged in the ECP.

The ECP again ruled that the elections were not held according to the party’s constitution and decided to strip the party PTI of its electoral symbol. PTI termed the order of ECP as “deeply flawed” and challenged it in both the Lahore High Court (LHC) and the Peshawar High Court (PHC).

On January 13, 2024, less than a month before the 2024 elections, a three-member Supreme Court bench affirmed the ECP’s decision, overturning a previous PHC reversal. Following the apex court decision, PTI candidates contested the elections as independent candidates.

Recently, the ECP ordered the PTI to hold intra-party polls within 20 days, allowing them to contest elections with the symbol of a ‘bat’23. The PTI’s internal elections were scheduled for February 5, 2024. However, the party later delayed the polls and gave the new date of March 3.

3,PTI does not want CJP to hear Imran’s cases,Says larger bench’s order held Justice Isa should not hear such cases,"After expressing total mistrust in Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamir Farooq, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan is contemplating to seek recusal of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa from any bench hearing matters related to him or his party.

Imran Khan’s spokesperson Shoaib Shaheen told The Express Tribune that he held a meeting with Imran at the Adiala Jail wherein it was discussed that CJP Isa should not hear cases related to Imran and his party in view of the larger bench order wherein it was held that Justice Isa should not hear cases involving Imran.

He stated that the PTI would move an application for his recusal in case any matter related to the party or its founder would be fixed before any bench led by CJP Isa.

Shaheen informed that they were preparing a petition against alleged rigging in the recent elections and the same would be filed in the apex court soon.

Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, already expressed mistrust in the IHC CJ. The IHC has issued notices to superior bars on their objections. The matter is still pending in the apex court. It is also witnessed that the previous PDM government had also expressed mistrust of the bench led by former CJP Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice
Munib Akhtar hearing the matter regarding the holding of general elections of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) assemblies. Then the PDM government was requesting the constitution of a full court but that plea was rejected.

Previously, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) had raised objections of biasness against then chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. Likewise, allegations of bias was levelled by the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) against then chief justice Mian Saqib Nisar. However, both parties could not succeed in recusing them from hearing cases related to them.

However, there was no judicial order restraining them from hearing cases related to a particular party.
In CJP Isa’s case, a larger bench led by CJP Gulzar Ahmed on Feb 11, 2021 held that Justice Isa should not hear cases involving the then PM Imran.

“The Hon Chief Justice of Pakistan, therefore, observed that in these circumstances it would not be proper for the Hon Judge (Justice Isa) to hear the matter considering that he had already filed a petition against the Prime Minister of Pakistan, in his personal capacity. Therefore, to uphold the principle of un-biasness and impartiality, it would be in the interest of justice that the Hon Judge should not hear matters involving the Prime Minister of Pakistan,” says a five-page written order in a case related to a news story citing him as announcing allocation of Rs500 million to all lawmakers ahead of the Senate polls.

The lawyers, however, are wondering as to why the PTI is agitating this issue as Justice Isa is hearing the party cases after taking charge as the CJP.

The PTI lawyers showed that they completely trusted him. Secondly, the apex court already ruled that only the judge himself could decide about allegations of biasness against him.

Even the Balochsitan Bar Council through Hamid Khan advocate had filed a review petition against the court’s Feb 11, 2011 order barring Justice Isa from hearing cases concerning Imran. The review petition is still pending.

The situation changed after the Jan 13 order wherein the bench led by CJP Isa held that PTI’s intra-party elections were held as illegal.

Subsequently, the PTI was deprived of its election symbol. Later, the PTI legal team was disappointed with the SC’s decision and withdrew the contempt petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the executive authorities for not implementing the court’s order to provide a level-playing field to the party during the elections.

It is being witnessed that the parties could not succeed to get relief through filing of objections on the judges. Likewise, when the PDM-led government was showing mistrust of former CJP Bandial, the superior bars led by the Independent Group was backing it.

However, now the bar led by the same group was fully supporting CJP Isa.

Even they will never endorse Imran’s objections on IHC CJ Farooq.

It is noted that several lawyers are not satisfied about the judiciary’s role in recent elections wherein there are serious allegations of rigging, implications of Jan 13 order wherein the PTI is facing difficulty to get reserved seats, allowing the trial of civilians in military courts by suspending the SC judgment, arrest of the PTI female activists etc.

Somehow, the PTI needs to understand that the judiciary is the only institution which redresses its grievances. When the PTI's relationship was cordial with the security establishment, the superior courts were giving it relief.

Now their relationship is tense and the PTI is finding it difficult to get judicial decisions in its favour.

4,NA to elect leader of house on Sunday,PML-N’s Shehbaz and PTI’s Omer Ayub will compete for the PM’s post,"PML-N’s Shehbaz Sharif and PTI’s Omer Ayub Khan will vie for the prime minister’s post as the election of the leader of house in the National Assembly will take place on March 3 (Sunday).

According to the schedule issued by the NA Secretariat, the nomination papers for the slot of the prime minister could be obtained from the Legislation Branch of the National Assembly and submitted till 2pm on Saturday (March 2).

The scrutiny of nomination papers would be completed by 3pm on the same day (Saturday).

The election for the prime minister would be conducted through division of members in the house.

As per the Constitution, before the voting process begins for the slot of prime minister, bells will ring for five minutes inside the Parliament House to inform every member — in case they are not present in the chamber at the moment — to gather inside.

Once the process begins, the doors will be locked, and no one will be allowed to enter or leave the hall till the PM’s election is concluded.

Under the supervision of the speaker, voting will be held through division.
For example, if there are two candidates, the speaker will say that ‘whoever wants to vote for candidate A can go to lobby A’ and ‘whoever wants to vote for candidate B, can go to lobby B’.

If there are three candidates then there can be a lobby C as well.

At the entrance of the said lobbies, there will be a member of the assembly secretariat staff who will record the name of every member of the National Assembly in the register.

The whole process will be open and people sitting in the galleries will be able to see who votes for whom. The political parties have to vote collectively and every member has to vote for the candidate that their party is voting for.

Section 91(4) of the Constitution states, “The Prime Minister shall be elected by the votes of the majority of the total membership of the National Assembly: Provided that, if no member secures such a majority in the first poll, a second poll shall be held between the members who secure the two highest numbers of votes in the first poll and the member who secures a majority of votes of the members present and voting shall be declared to have been elected as Prime Minister:

Provided further that, if the number of votes secured by two or more members securing the highest number of votes is equal, further poll shall be held between them until one of them secures a majority of votes of the members present and voting.”

PTI Secretary General Ayub reached JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman's house, seeking votes for the posts of National Assembly speaker, deputy speaker and the prime minister. The delegation included Ayub, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser, and Junaid Akbar.

Similarly, a delegation comprising PML-N, PPP, PML-Q, BAP and IPP leaders arrived at the residence of Fazl, seeking votes for the three posts. The delegation included Rana Sanaullah, Ahsan Iqbal, Ayaz Sadiq, Saad Rafique and Yusuf Raza Gillani.

5,IHC defers Imran’s conviction suspension plea,Will take up his main appeal against trial court orders on March 5,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has indefinitely deferred the hearing of a couple of petitions filed by former prime minister Imran Khan for the suspension of his conviction and sentences in the gift repository and diplomatic cipher cases.

However, the court will hear Imran’s appeal against his conviction in the two cases on March 5.

An accountability court convicted Imran and his wife Bushra Bibi in the gifts repository—Toshakhana—case on January 31, sentencing each of them to 14 years in prison.

A day earlier, on January 30, a special court also sentenced the former PM, Imran, and the former foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, to ten years in prison for allegedly misusing a diplomatic cipher in the last days of the PTI government in March 2022.

The PTI founder, his wife, and Qureshi later filed appeals against the trial courts’ orders. They also filed petitions seeking suspension of their conviction and sentences.

A division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb resumed hearing these petitions on Thursday.

During the proceedings, Justice Aurangzeb noted that the IHC has already issued an order highlighting the reasons as to why the suspension of conviction is so rarely allowed in criminal cases.

“We are bound to abide by that order. As the order has already been challenged in the Supreme Court, we will wait for the apex court to decide that matter. We will, therefore, defer your request [for suspension of Imran Khan’s conviction and sentence] for an indefinite period,” he said.

The prosecutor for the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the respondent in the gifts case, told the court that NAB special prosecutor Amjad Pervaiz could not attend the hearing due to the death of a relative. He requested the court to defer the hearing until the second week of March.

The assistant attorney general also told the bench that two special prosecutors were supposed to be appointed to represent the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the respondent in the cipher case.

He also requested the court to adjourn the matter, noting that the FIA has written to the Ministry of Law for hiring the special prosecutors.

Imran’s lawyer, Salman Safdar, told the bench that the trial court concluded the proceedings in a hurry and did not allow the accused to present his case.

Justice Farooq noted that the IHC will review if the trial courts have made any mistakes in the light of court records. The court later adjourned the hearing of the appeal against the trial courts’ orders until March 5.

Thee Saudi authorities would start issuing visas to more than 1.2 million pilgrims for the upcoming annual Hajj from Friday (today) as the kingdom prepared for the arrival of the Muslims from around the world just before mid-May, media reports said, quoting Saudi officials, on Thursday.

A Saudi committee, in charge of housing the pilgrims in the holy city of Makkah, has already licensed a total of 1,860 buildings for the upcoming annual Hajj season, to accommodate an estimated 1.2 million pilgrims, according to the reports.

This year’s Hajj will fall between Friday, June 14 and Wednesday, June 19, depending on the sighting of the moon. From last year, the number of pilgrims, performing Hajj had returned to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels.

Al Rabiah explained that places for different countries would be designated depending on finalising contracts. According to the minister, the number of buildings for pilgrims in Makkah, was expected to eventually exceed 5,000.

Makkah Deputy Governor of Prince Saud bin Meshal has recently extended the deadline for receiving applications from landlords of such buildings for licensing them, until the end of Shawwal, corresponding to May 8.

8,PHC seeks ECP response on SIC's seats,Party claims non allocation of reserved seats is a violation of Constitution," The Peshawar High Court (PHC) has sought a reply from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) within seven days while hearing a petition filed by the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) for the allocation of reserved seats to the party in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), Punjab, and national legislatures.

A division bench comprising Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Waqar Ahmad on Thursday took up a writ petition filed by the SIC, a little-known political party which is now in a position to form a government in the K-P thanks to the inclusion of PTI-backed candidates after the Feb 8 vote.

The PTI faced a setback when an ECP decision stripped it of its iconic election symbol just weeks before the polls, rendering the party unable to contest elections as a political entity.

PTI candidates had to contest the general elections as independents. However, these independents managed to outstrip all other parties in the National Assembly, Punjab Assembly, and the K-P Assembly.

As per the Constitution, independent candidates have to join a political party within three days of the general elections, and the PTI-backed candidates joined the SIC after an agreement.

The SIC later approached the ECP for the allocation of reserved seats to its members in various legislatures. The ECP, however, reserved its order on the SIC petition on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the party moved a writ petition in the PHC through advocate Shah Faisal Utmankhel, nominating both the ECP and the Provincial Election Commissioner as respondents.

It contended that the non-allocation of reserved seats for female and minority lawmakers was illegal and in violation of fundamental rights.

It noted that if the party, which has a majority in the K-P province, is not allocated the reserved seats, such an omission would amount to a violation of the Constitution.

""[This] would amount to extreme injustice to the mandate given by the general public and would violate the fundamental rights of women and minorities.

The SIC requested the PHC to direct the ECP to allocate SIC its reserved seats in proportion to its general seats in the K-P Assembly, the Punjab Assembly, and the National Assembly.

During the hearing of the petition, the petitioner stated that according to Articles 51 and 106 of the Constitution, parliament will only be complete when seats for women and minorities are also filled, as without them, neither the Assembly nor the Senate sessions can be convened.

""This is a matter of public interest because if women are not given their reserved seats in the K-P Assembly, it will be tantamount to the absence of women's representation in the assembly, even though they have been successful in the election with a significant majority.

""Therefore, it is essential that the party is allocated the reserved seats so that their representation can be accompanied by addressing their issues on an urgent constitutional and legal basis.""

After the initial hearing of the petition, the court asked the ECP to submit a response within 7 days.

The PTI had also filed a petition in the PHC for the allocation of reserved seats earlier, but that petition was withdrawn for some legal reasons

9,Gwadar declared ‘disaster zone’ after heavy rains,"Interim Balochistan govt imposes emergency in coastal city, kicks off relief and rescue ops","The caretaker Balochistan government on Thursday imposed an emergency in Gwadar and declared it a disaster zone after heavy rains triggered devastating flash floods in the coastal city.

In a statement, Balochistan caretaker Information Jan Achakzai said the provincial government had decided to declare Gwadar calamity-hit and impose an emergency, acknowledging the severity of the situation.
According to Achakzai, caretaker Balochistan Chief Minister Ali Mardan Khan Domki has already signed a summary for this purpose and a notification will be issued soon.

He added that the interim CM would personally monitor relief activities in all the rain-hit areas of the province.

Following the devastating flash floods in Gwadar, triggered by heavy rainfall that lashed the area for several hours and left thousands of residents homeless as well as in dire need of assistance as the downpour caused widespread destruction, Haq Do Tehreek Balochistan (HDTB) chief Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, who won the election for PB-24, on Thursday reached the coastal city -- where his constituency was located -- to coordinate rescue operations.

The torrential downpours not only inundated residential areas but also disrupted essential services including the power supply and already strained sewerage system, adding to the miseries of the locals.

With the situation growing increasingly dire, urgent measures are being taken to provide shelter, food, and medical aid to those affected by the calamity.

The rainwater inundated the streets of Gwadar with an alarming depth of six to seven feet.

According to officials, Gwadar district received over 180 millimetres of rainfall over the past two days.
The coastal highway connecting Karachi with Gwadar was damaged because of the heavy rainfall, disrupting vehicular traffic.

The impact of the flash floods has reverberated beyond Gwadar, with heavy rainfall also battering Quetta and other parts of Balochistan

In the statement, the interim provincial information minister said relief and rescue operations were under way in coastal areas hit by heavy rains.

“Teams of the district administration, army, navy, Provincial Disaster Management Authority, Levies and National Disaster Management Authority are working day and night in Gwadar, Ormara, Pasni and other areas,” he added.

He continued that all available resources were being used to drain the accumulated rainwater and for the well-being of the affected population.

Achakzai expressed concerns about the major damage to Gwadar’s fundamental infrastructure because of the continuous rains.

“According to the latest information, two out of six disconnected roads from Gwadar city have been restored, and around 300 individuals have been safely relocated,” he maintained.

He added that around 80 boats had been dispatched to the area for evacuation.

“Assessments are being conducted in the area to determine the extent of damage,” the statement read.

Separately, caretaker CM Domki said that rescue operations were under way in the rain-hit areas with the help of the army.

In a statement, he observed that an “unusual and disastrous situation” had emerged because of the heavy downpours.

In light of the adverse weather conditions, the Balochistan education department has taken the proactive step of ordering the closure of all private and government-run schools across the province, prioritising the safety of students and staff.

Relentless rainfall and hail continued to lash Gwadar and its surrounding areas, compounding the challenges faced by rescue teams and exacerbating the plight of the affected population.

Furthermore, the rains in Nagor have led to the breach of protective dams, exacerbating the already precarious situation.
Amid the devastation, efforts are under way to provide relief and assistance to those grappling with the aftermath of the flash floods.

The solidarity and swift action demonstrated by MPA Hidayatur Rehman and other stakeholders underscore the resilience and compassion of the Pakistani people in times of adversity.
