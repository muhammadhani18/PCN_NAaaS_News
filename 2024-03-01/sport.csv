1,Gayle hopes T20 World Cup can help cricket crack US market,LONDON: Former West Indies star Chris Gayle hopes the T20 World Cup will help cricket crack the lucrative American...,"LONDON: Former West Indies star Chris Gayle hopes the T20 World Cup will help cricket crack the lucrative American sports market and lift the game onto a new global level.
The Twenty20 showpiece, which starts on June 1, is being jointly hosted by the United States and Gayle’s native West Indies, where big crowds are expected.
But it will be the first major international cricket tournament staged in the United States, with a sell-out crowd expected for the clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan at a temporary 34,000-seat venue in Long Island, New York.
Gayle believes the success of last year’s inaugural Major League Cricket, a US-based T20 franchise event, has given the game a foothold in America.
“The ICC (International Cricket Council) has been trying to get cricket on a global scale within the US,” Gayle told AFP in an interview marking 100 days to go until the start of the T20 World Cup.
“India v Pakistan is in New York, I’m sure it’s going to be phenomenal.
“They [US] had a T20 tournament last year and it was a success. It’s a big market, we just have to hope it will be a success within the United States.”
West Indies have pedigree in limited-overs cricket, winning the first two men’s ODI World Cups in 1975 and 1979, but they failed even to qualify for last year’s 50-over tournament in India.
“We missed out on the 50-over World Cup so this will be something fantastic for the guys to actually play for something,” said Gayle, speaking via video call from Barbados. “We just want to be in the [June 29] final here in Barbados. Anything is possible when you make it to the final.
“I’m excited for the people, to actually see a bit of cricket,” added Gayle, who in 2007 became the first batsman to score a T20 International century.
The 44-year-old, a member of the West Indies teams that become T20 world champions in 2012 and 2016, said the current side had enough  “options and experience” to relieve holders England of their title, even though they are a lowly seventh in the world rankings.
One pressing issue for global cricket chiefs is that top players no longer need to play internationals to make a living in an era of worldwide franchise competitions.
Former West Indies captain Jason Holder missed the Test series in Australia to play T20 cricket in the United Arab Emirates instead.
Gayle, who had several run-ins with Caribbean cricket chiefs over availability, said it was down to administrators to re-balance the schedule.
“I’m in favour always of the players making their earnings, it’s their livelihood, it’s their job,” he said. “Cricket is actually a big business, so we can’t beat down on a player to choose a franchise over his country, because there’s no loyalty from both sides.
“There’s just too much cricket and it takes away a bit from international cricket, unless there’s two big teams playing. They just need to structure it a bit better to make sure both teams are competitive when they are going against each other at international level.”

LONDON: Manchester Uni­ted will host Liverpool in an FA Cup quarter-final blockbuster after the bitter rivals took contrasting routes to their fifth round victories on Wednesday.
United eased the pressure on beleaguered boss Erik ten Hag as they scraped through with a 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest thanks to Casemiro’s late goal.
Fresh from their League Cup final triumph against Chelsea on Sunday, Liverpool relied on their youngsters again in a 3-0 win against second tier Southampton at Anfield.
Chelsea bounced back from their painful 1-0 defeat to Liverpool at Wembley, snatching a 3-2 win against Champ­ionship promotion chasers Leeds United to book a last eight date with Leicester City.
After Liverpool’s ball boys paraded the League Cup around Anfield prior to kick-off, Jurgen Klopp’s kids gave another glimpse into a bright future as two of their young guns inspired the win.
With Liverpool ravaged by injuries to Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Diogo Jota and Alisson Becker among others, Lewis Koumas, the son of former Wales and West Brom midfielder Jason Koumas, marked his debut with the opening goal in the 44th minute.
The 18-year-old forward drilled a fierce low drive that deflected in off Southampton’s Jack Stephens.
Jayden Danns, another 18-year-old offspring of a former player — his father Neil starred for Crystal Palace — netted Liverpool’s second in the 73rd minute with a composed finish that belied his tender age.
James McConnell, 19, and Bobby Clark, 19, also impressed for Liverpool, who introduced 16-year-old Trey Nyoni to become their youngest ever FA Cup player in the second half.
Danns capped the victory in the 88th minute when he lashed home in front of The Kop.
“We don’t take these things for granted,” Klopp said of facing United. “The situation is horribly difficult. We have too many games and not enough players. They (the youngsters) have got to learn and improve, but it was a top performance.”
At the City Ground, United reached the FA Cup quarter-finals for a record 48th time.
Ten Hag insisted this week that he doesn’t need a public vote of confidence from Jim Ratcliffe after the British billionaire took charge of United’s football operations.
But United are languishing in sixth place in the Premier League, eight points adrift of the top four, after Saturday’s shock 2-1 home defeat against Fulham.
A loss to Forest would have been a major blow for Ten Hag after Ratcliffe was linked with a move for former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane.
The FA Cup represents United’s last silverware chance this term and, after missing a host of chances, they finally hit the target in the 89th minute when Bruno Fernandes’ free-kick was headed in by Casemiro.
“It’s the best time to score at the end. On Saturday we felt the defeat in stoppage-time. What they showed today is great,” Ten Hag said.
At Stamford Bridge, Mauricio Pochettino will have felt similar relief to Ten Hag.
With the pressure mounting in his troubled first season in charge, the Argentine was indebted to Conor Gallagher for a late winner.
It was the first FA Cup tie between Chelsea and Leeds since the Blues won the 1970 FA Cup final replay, a booking-filled clash regarded as one of the most vicious matches in English football history.
Mateo Joseph put Leeds ahead before Nicolas Jackson and Mykhailo Mudryk netted to give Chelsea the lead.
Joseph scored again but Gallagher won it in the 90th minute.
“In the context of the week, I’m happy. The performance wasn’t great but of course it’s about building our confidence again,” Pochettino said.
Elsewhere, Wolverhampton Wanderers beat Brighton and Hove Albion 1-0 at Molineux, with Mario Lemina’s goal after just 77 seconds securing a home tie against second tier Coventry.
Holders Manchester City, who beat Luton 6-2 on Tuesday, will host Newcastle in the other quarter-final.

Hosts Rouen had knoc­ked out both holders Toul­ouse and AS Monaco on penalties in previous rou­nds en route to the last eight.
But they could not repeat the feat as Abdejalil Sahlo­une and Zana Allee both saw their spot-kicks saved by Valenciennes goalkee­per Jean Louchet as the visitors won the shoot-out 4-2.
Nigerian forward Math­ias Oyewusi had headed Valenciennes, who sit rock bottom of Ligue 2, into a 26th-minute lead.
Rouen managed to force penalties as Damien Loppy scored on the rebound in the first minute of added time after his penalty was saved by Louchet.

6,Murray ‘not likely’ to play past summer,DUBAI: Former world number one Andy Murray said on Wednesday he is  “likely not going to play competitive tennis...,"DUBAI: Former world number one Andy Murray said on Wednesday he is  “likely not going to play competitive tennis past this summer”.
The British three-time Grand Slam champion, 36, has won just two of his eight matches this season and appears ready to put an end to his storied career.
Murray, who fell to French fifth seed Ugo Humbert 6-2, 6-4 in the Dubai second round on Wednesday, has not recorded back-to-back victories since September and has faced persistent questions over his future.
“I’m likely not going to play past this summer,” he said. “I get asked about it after every single match that I play, every single tournament that I play. I’m bored of the question, to be honest.
“I’m not going to talk more about that between now and whenever the time comes for me to stop.
“But yeah, I don’t plan on playing much past this summer.”
Murray, who has been playing with a metal hip since he underwent resurfacing surgery in 2019, hopes to compete at the French Open in May, which would be his first appearance at Roland Garros since 2020.
“Last few years I’ve tried to give myself maybe better preparation for the grass season, but that also doesn’t guarantee that you’re going to play really well on the grass,” said Murray. “I’ve had experiences through my career where I didn’t play the French Open in 2013 and I won Wimbledon.
“I don’t think it makes a huge difference if you get an extra week’s practice or so on the grass. So yeah, I would like to play [Roland Garros] one more time.”.

Sky Sport Italy and La Repubblica reported the sports prosecutor’s request for a four-year ban was granted.
Pogba was provisionally suspended by Italy’s national anti-doping tribunal in September after testing positive for testosterone — a banned substance.
The test, performed after Juve’s 3-0 Serie A season-opening victory at Udinese on Aug 20, detected testosterone, a hormone that increases athletes’ endurance. The 30-year-old was an unused substitute in that game.
Pogba’s positive doping test was also  confirmed  in a counter-analysis on a second sample in October.
Juventus did not comment but a source confirmed that the club had been notified about the decision of a four-year ban and would assess the next steps.The Frenchman has had a torrid second spell with Juve due to injuries since he returned to the Turin-based outfit following his departure from Manchester United on a free transfer in 2022.
The 2018 World Cup winner barely played last season due to knee and hamstring injuries as well as knee surgery, which pre­v­ented him playing for France at the World Cup in Qatar.

Inter, who have won all eight of their league games in 2024, are on 69 points from 26 games, comfortably ahead of second-placed Juventus with 57 and rivals AC Milan in third on 53.
“It’s nice at the moment, but we know that it was in the past month that we’ve gained these 12 points to move ahead,” coach Simone Inzaghi told a press conference.  “We have to stay focused.”
Defender Matteo Darmian put Inter in front in the 26th minute with a low strike from the edge of the box before Lautaro Martinez doubled the advantage in first-half stoppage time, firing a powerful shot inside the left post.
Federico Dimarco added a third for Inter in the 54th minute, netting on the follow-up after Atalanta keeper Marco Carnesecchi saved a penalty from Martinez, and Davide Frattesi nodded home an Alexis Sanchez free kick to seal the win.
“In the second half I didn’t even see it that bad,” said Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini. 
“Then we made a lot of changes and it became more of a training session than a match, it degenerated. The third goal I don’t think it was a Serie A match.”
Atalanta, who next week host Portuguese side Sporting in the Europa League last 16, are fifth with 46 points, two adrift of fourth-placed Bologna.
In Wednesday’s other mat­ch, clinical Victor Osimhen scored a hat-trick before Khvicha  Kvaratskhelia bagged a  brace of his own as Napoli come from behind to win their game in hand  6-1 and reignite hopes of European football.
After Amir Rrahmani  levelled just before the half-hour mark, Osimhen rattled in his treble  across 16 minutes either side of half-time to take his goal tally since  returning from the Africa Cup of Nations to five in three matches in all  competitions.
And Kvaratskhelia, who rolled Osimhen in for his  simple third, belted in two fabulous strikes in the 51st and 75th  minutes against a dreadful Sassuolo.
“We already knew that Osimhen  was a great player, we missed him a lot. When you’ve got Osi in this  kind of form everything is easier,” said Matteo Politano, who set up two  of Osimhen’s goals, to DAZN.
Napoli are still ninth but four  points behind AS Roma, who sit sixth and in the Europa Conference League  spot, after just their third league win of 2024.
Sassuolo, playing for  the first time under Emiliano Bigica following Alessio Dionisi’s  sacking on Sunday, drop down into the relegation zone following a sixth defeat in seven matches.

WELLINGTON: Cameron Green slammed only his second Test century on Thursday to steer Australia to 279-9 at stumps on the opening day of the first Test in Wellington.
The visitors were tottering on 89-4 after being put into bat at the Basin Reserve before Green dug in for a rescue mission with the help of Mitchell Marsh, who made 40.
The 24-year-old brought up three figures with his 16th four in the final over to end day one on 103 with Josh Hazlewood yet to score.
“Obviously it feels really good, mainly with where we were as a team,” Green said.
“It was a pretty tough wicket out there ... someone just needed to bat through so glad it was me. Was nice to stick it out there, and hopefully put a semi-competitive total on the board.”
Green, batting at number four, fought back after New Zealand seamer Matt Henry took the key wickets of Steve Smith, Usman Khawaja and Marsh to end with 4-43 on a green pitch.
Henry dismissed Smith for 31 before lunch, bowled Khawaja for 33 after the break then snagged Marsh and Nathan Lyon, for five.
Scott Kuggeleijn, restored to the side, also grabbed two wickets, removing out-of-form Marnus Labuschagne for one and Alex Carey for 10.
Black Caps rising star Will O’Rourke, who took nine wickets on his debut this month, bagged two more in the shape of Travis Head (one) and Mitchell Starc (nine).
Green said the wicket would still offer plenty for the Australian quick bowlers on Friday.
“It’s pretty close, I reckon they are just on top,” he said.  “They have a quality batting line-up and we have to bowl well tomorrow.”
Marsh and Green offered the resistance with a 67-run partnership off 77 balls.
But Marsh succumbed to Henry, caught behind by Tom Blundell, before Carey meekly slapped a Kuggeleijn delivery to Kane Williamson at cover.
With stumps beckoning, New Zealand attacked Australia’s tail with Starc, Pat Cummins and Lyon dismissed in the space of 57 runs.
After winning the toss, Tim Southee and New Zealand’s pace bowlers were frustrated by Smith and Khawaja as they put on 61 before Henry got the breakthrough.
Smith, promoted to open for the second Test in a row after the retirement of David Warner, lasted 71 deliveries, crunching four boundaries.
Henry induced him to play back to a delivery that nipped and took the edge, with Blundell collecting a sharp diving catch in front of first slip.
Labuschagne departed after a defensive knock, getting a thick outside edge to Daryl Mitchell at slip off Kuggeleijn, with Khawaja and Head following in quick succession.
Henry’s inswinger took out the stump of Khawaja before Head went after O’Rourke’s but clipped the ball to Blundell.
Marsh crashed six fours and a six before Henry struck again straight after tea, with Australia’s Twenty20 skipper attempting a pull shot that landed in Blundell’s gloves.
Carey departed for 10 to leave Australia on 176-6 before O’Rourke had Starc caught at second slip.
Cummins was trapped lbw by spinner Rachin Ravindra with Henry taking his fourth when Lyon was also caught behind.
New Zealand are looking for a first Test victory over Australia since 2011 and came into the two-match series on the back of a 2-0 sweep against South Africa this month.

11,HBL PSL 2024:  Rutherford takes Gladiators home in last-ball finish,"After captain Rilee Ros­souw’s departure, Ruthe­rford and Hosein hit a six each in the space of five balls to ease the pressure on Quetta as they needed 44 off 24 balls.","

KARACHI: The stands here at the National Bank Stadium were more densely filled than they were a day ago and excitement had filled the air. Karachi Kings, despite half of their squad suffering from food poisoning, still showed up.
The home side, starting from a point of disadvanta­ge with some of their main players missing out, punc­hed above their weig­ht and had Quetta Gladiators well under their control but the West Indies pair of Sherfane Rutherford and Akeal Hosein had other plans.
The Gladiators needed 80 off the last eight overs with five wickets in hand when Hosein joined Ruth­erford. What followed was a show of immense power by the two left-handers.
After captain Rilee Ros­souw’s departure, Ruthe­rford and Hosein hit a six each in the space of five balls to ease the pressure on Quetta as they needed 44 off 24 balls.
Rutherford dispatched Hasan to the top of the roof over the stands on square-leg before picking pacer Blessing Muzarabani up and over wide long-on for another maximum.  
He slapped Hasan for another six in the penultimate over before clearing the long-off boundary for two more sixes off Anwar Ali in the final over.
Still needing to defend three off four balls, Anwar bowled two well directed yorkers for dots. He followed it up with a low full toss and Rutherford slashed it to backward point, where it was fielded brilliantly.
It probably wouldn’t even be a single in a normal situation, but Rutherford stole two off the delivery, as chaos unfolded on the pitch with Anwar desperately blocking his way. The Guyanese went on to flick for four to take the Gladiators across the finish line for a five-wicket win.
The base for the chase accomplished by Ruthe­rford (58 off 31) and Hosein (22 off 17) was laid by ope­ner Jason Roy’s 52 off 31 as the Englishman was the only Gladiators batter to take the attack onto the Kings.
Roy twice cleared long-on for sixes against Moha­mmad Nawaz and creamed the spinner through square on the off-side for four in the third over.
His opening partner Saud Shakeel, however, fell on the last ball of the powerplay; the left-hander finding Irfan Khan Niazi at square off Hasan after the right-armer was pulled for six by Roy.
Khawaja Nafay fell in the ninth over as he found Irfan’s bucket hands at long-on off Zahid Mahmood’s leg-spin before wicket-keeper Tim Seifert’s acrobatic effort down the leg-side in the next over saw Sarfraz Ahmed get caught off Hasan.
The right-armer spoiled the breakthrough with a no-ball to follow it up and got launched over square-leg by Roy for six on the subsequent free hit as the batter brought up his 50 in 27 balls as the Gladiators’ scorecard read 83-3 at halfway stage.
Shoaib Malik then provided the major breakthro­ugh;  the veteran off-spinner forcing a top-edge off Roy and grabbing the catch himself in the 12th over. Rossouw lost his patience and became Zahid’s first victim as he found Irfan at the wide long-on boundary, leaving the match inclined towards the Kings before Rutherford and Hosein took it away.
After being put into bat earlier, the Kings got off to a decent start but the spin trio of Usman Tariq, Hosein and Abrar Ahmed made good use of the surface’s slowness to keep the hosts from finding rhythm.
Usman, with his unorthodox bowling style — a precise run-up followed by a pause and throw — in particular, was almost unplayable for the Karachi batters as he registered figures of 2-16 in four overs without conceding a single boundary.
He bagged the crucial wickets of Karachi opener Seifert and first-drop James Vince after they had put up 57 off 36 balls together following the early dismissal of captain Shan Masood by Hosein.
None of the Karachi batters could make a stand out difference after Seifert and Vince’s departure, but each of them made small contributions to push the team to a competitive total.
Vince ensured Karachi didn’t go on the back foot , notably dispatching  Abrar for three fours in a row as they ended the powerplay at 61-1.
But Usman’s trapped Seifert (21 off 11) lbw with one that sharply turned inwards to strike the right-hander’s pads on the first ball and did the same to Vince (37 off 25) on the last ball of the over.
The wickets took Karachi to the back foot but Nawaz crunched pacer Moha­m­mad Wasim Jr for three fou­rs in a row to take his team to 91-3 at halfway stage.
Malik holed Abrar out to Rossouw before Nawaz (28) cut Hosein right into the hands of Abrar. Abrear cleaned up Pollard and got Hasan caught before Anwar glided Wasim for a four and slapped the bowler for two powerful hits for sixes in the final over to set up a last-ball finish.

12,PCB forms body for selling bilateral series rights,PCB chief operating officer Salman Naseer and director commercial Bab­ar Hameed are included in the committee.,"LAHORE: The Pakis­tan Cricket Board (PCB) has formed a committee to sell media and production rights, live streaming and screening rights of the bilateral international series to be staged in Pakistan during the next three years.
PCB chief operating officer Salman Naseer and director commercial Bab­ar Hameed are included in the committee.
Dawn has learnt that the PCB is expected to sell the media rights for Rs15-20 billion for 100 days of international matches to be held in the country during the next three years.
The PCB intends to give production rights for Rs10 billion and around Rs2 billion for the live streaming as well as screen rights.
Sources told Dawn that the PCB most probably will retain the same partners for the media and production rights, which had won the rights of ongoing PSL 9 and 10 including WorldTrans and ARY, respectively as the state-run Pakistan Tele­vision (PTV) may not show any interest to participate in the bidding process. The PTV did not feature in the bidding for PSL 9 and 10 too.

13,Bumrah back for final England Test,NEW DELHI: India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah will return for the final Test against England after missing the...,"NEW DELHI: India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah will return for the final Test against England after missing the team’s series-clinching win in the fourth match, the country’s cricket board said on Thursday.
Bumrah was rested in the previous Test, which India won by five wickets in Ranchi to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said Bumrah  “will link-up with the squad in Dharamsala” for the final Test starting on March 7.
Batsman KL Rahul will miss out again after he was forced out of the previous three due to a quad injury he picked up in the opener.
Spinner Washington Sundar has been released from the squad to join his state team Tamil Nadu for the Ranji Trophy semi-finals and will rejoin the national team for the Test  “if need be”.
The BCCI also said Mohammed Shami had successfully undergone surgery for a right heel injury after the fast bowler posted social media photographs of himself from hospital after the operation on Tuesday.
“He is recovering well and will soon head to the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru to commence his rehabilitation process,” the statement said.
Squad: Rohit Sharma (captain), Jasprit Bumrah (vice-captain), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Rajat Patidar, Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel (wicket-keeper), KS Bharat (wicket-keeper), Devdutt Padikkal, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ra­v­­indra Jadeja, Axar Pa­tel, Kuldeep Yadav, Moh­ammed Siraj, Mukesh Kumar, Akash Deep.

14,Ireland eye maiden Test victory over Afghanistan,ABU DHABI: Ireland put themselves in a strong position to claim their first Test victory at the eighth attempt...,"ABU DHABI: Ireland put themselves in a strong position to claim their first Test victory at the eighth attempt despite a late fightback from Afghanistan on day two of their one-off Test in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.
Resuming their first innings on 100-4, 55 runs behind Afghanistan’s opening effort, Ireland’s middle and lower order dragged them to 263 all out and a 108-run lead.
When Afghanistan were reduced to 38-2 a two-day finish looked possible, but despite losing Noor Ali Zadran for 32, an unbroken 41-run stand between captain Hashmatullah Shahidi and Rahmanullah Gurbaz took the nominal hosts to 134-3.
“There was pressure but I kept it calm and simple... Because as a captain you have to lead by example,” Shahidi said after ending the day 53 not out, his second Test fifty.
“Last two Tests my performance was not good but today I felt good...
Tomorrow is a big day for us. We have to win the first session to be in the mix.”
Any first-innings lead for Ireland looked a way off when Harry Tector was dismissed by Naveed Zadran to leave them 106-5.
But Paul Stirling made 52, putting on 80 runs with wicket-keeper Lorcan Tucker, who later fell to Zia-ur-Rehman Akbar for 46.
A useful 38, though, from Andy McBrine, who was last man out, put Ireland in a strong position.
Left-arm spinner Akbar finished with 5-64 from his 30 overs.
Irish seamer Mark Adair followed up his first-innings five-wicket haul by taking the crucial wickets of Ibrahim Zadran and Rahmat Shah.
Ibrahim Zadran was brilliantly taken in the gully by Peter Moor before Shah nicked behind to Tucker.
Noor Ali Zadran and Shahidi rebuilt steadily before the veteran opener was bounced out by Barry McCarthy.
But Rahmanullah, making his Test debut, counter-attacked, hitting two sixes in his unbeaten 23.
Afghanistan, who like Ireland played their first Test in 2018, will be hopeful of notching their fourth victory in the format if they can set the tourists a testing run chase on a pitch already showing signs of significant turn.

15,Paris Olympic village ready on time as confidence grows,The village was a major test of whether the Paris Games could avoid the pitfalls of past editions.,"PARIS: The organisers of the Paris Olympics took possession of the newly built athletes’ village on Thursday on schedule, reinforcing growing confidence that they will be ready for the Games.
At an inauguration ceremony in northern Paris, chief organiser Tony Estanguet rece­ived a symbolic key for the complex in front of VIPs including President Emmanuel Macron.
The roughly 40 low-rise tower blocks will house around 14,000 people over the course of the Olympics, which kick off on July 26, and another 9,000 during the Paralympics afterwards.
The handover target of March 1 for the crucial piece of Olym­pics infrastructure was exce­eded by a day, with all sides keen to stress that the construction work was finished on time and only marginally over budget.
“It’s a demonstration that we have honoured our commitments,” Macron told reporters after meeting workers who he said should be  “proud” of taking part in what he called  “the adventure of a century”.
The village was a major test of whether the Paris Games could avoid the pitfalls of past editions.
Wasteful over-spending, rushed construction work and extravagant  “white elephant” infrastructure projects have consistently tarnished the reputation of the Olympics.
Concerns about climate cha­nge have also led activists to target the enormous carbon footprint of an event that brings together athletes and spectators from across the world every four years.
Paris organisers see themselves as promoting a new  “sobre” model, with a focus on using existing or temporary sporting infrastructure, as well as promoting recycling, re-use and innovative low-carbon technologies.
“We’ve made a village that’s a showcase, but also a manifesto of what we know how to do best in France today in response to the major questions posed for urbanisation in the 21st century,” Olympics infrastructure chief Nicolas Ferrand told Macron.
By using low-carbon concrete, wood structures, and renewable geothermal heating, organisers claim the village will create around half the amount of carbon emissions over its lifetime compared with an equivalent built with standard construction techniques.
The village is the single biggest new-build Olympics project, located on a site by the river Seine that is a focus for regeneration efforts in the economically deprived Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis.
The suburb, which also hosts the national stadium, is the poorest and most crime-ridden of mainland France.
“We made a promise: that we would create above all a new neighbourhood for Seine-Saint-Denis rather than an Olympic and Paralympic village,” Laurent Michaud, director of village operations for the organising committee, told reporters earlier this week.
Roughly two thirds of the 2.0-billion-euro ($2.2 billion) budget has been provided by private real estate companies, with the state contributing 646 million euros.
During the Games, it will include a 24-hour restaurant, an alcohol-free bar, as well as training facilities.
Afterwards, around a third of the 2,800 apartments will be sold off to private homeowners, while a third is destined for public housing, and the rest for rentals, including for students.
Opinion polls suggest a majority of French people support the Paris Games, though expensive tickets, political bickering and disruption to life in the capital have soured the mood recently.
“Wherever the Games have been held, you have inconveniences that come at the end,” Macron said when asked about the mood of the country.
Other environmental innovations in the village include a mini water-processing plant to recycle water that will be used on the more than 9,000 trees and shrubs that are set to be planted on the site.
“The village is already ready for the climate of 2050,” Ferrand added.
Some pavements have been made from oyster and other seashells to absorb heat, while the beds to be used by athletes are made out of reinforced cardboard and recycled fishing nets.
Organisers are set to spend the next four months fitting out the village with more than 300,000 items of furniture and decoration.
The tower blocks each have a different design, which is intended to underline the  “architectural variety” that is seen as a marker of European cities.
