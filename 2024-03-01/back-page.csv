• Israel claims truck drivers ran over crowds amid looting, admits soldiers fired at people
• UN slams killings; Biden says incident will complicate ceasefire talks
GAZA: Desperate for food amid the looming famine, hundreds of Palestinians flocked to an aid distribution point early on Thursday morning, only to be met with live fire by Israeli troops.
At least 104 people are said to have been killed in what has been described as a massacre, while the health ministry said around 760 people were wounded in the grisly incident.
The incident caused the largest loss of civilian lives in weeks and was condemned by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as an “ugly massacre conducted by the Israeli occupation army on people who waited for aid trucks at the Nabulsi roundabout”.
 






Just hours earlier, the death toll from the nearly five-month-old war had topped 30,000.
There were conflicting reports on what exactly was responsible for Thursday’s deaths: Israel claimed that many of the dead were crushed by the truck drivers as they became overwhelmed by people trying to loot the supplies.
However, Israeli sources confirmed to AFP that the Israeli forces at the scene did open fire, having perceived the crowds near the trucks as a “threat”.
A young Palestinian man who was among the wounded spoke of chaotic scenes.
“There were crowds of people, but the occupation (forces) kept firing towards us,” the man told AFP while lying on the dirty, crowded floor at Kamal Adwan Hospital waiting for treatment.
At Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, doctors were “unable to deal” with the flood of casualties “as a result of weak medical and human capacities,” said Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for Gaza’s health ministry.
According to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, just over 2,300 aid trucks have entered the Gaza Strip in February, down by around 50 per cent compared to January.
 






That is an average of well below 100 trucks per day, down from around 500 that were entering daily before the war. It was precisely that scarcity that drove crowds to rush the trucks at Nabulsi roundabout on Thursday, a witness told AFP.
 






On Wednesday, Israel said that a convoy of 31 trucks had moved to northern Gaza on Tuesday night and said the UN was responsible for distribution. UN-OCHA, however, said no UN agency was involved.
Aerial footage distributed by the Israeli military showed large groups approaching a line of moving trucks on foot.
 






 






“Trucks full of aid came too close to some army tanks that were in the area and the crowd, thousands of people, just stormed the trucks,” the witness said, declining to be named for safety reasons.
“The soldiers fired at the crowd as people came too close to the tanks.”
UN condemnation
UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said on Thursday he was appalled at the reported killings and injuries of people during the transfer of aid supplies west of Gaza City.
“Even after close to five months of brutal hostilities, Gaza still has the ability to shock us,” Griffiths said in a post on X.
 






“I’m appalled at the reported killing and injury of hundreds of people during a transfer of aid supplies west of Gaza City today… Life is draining out of Gaza at terrifying speed,” the UN humanitarian chief said.
Complicate negotiations
US President Joe Biden, who had been hopeful of securing a ceasefire by next week, admitted after the incident that it would complicate the negotiations.
Speaking to reporters, he said the White House was checking “competing versions” of the shooting incident. He also said a temporary ceasefire probably would not happen by Monday, as he had earlier predicted, but said he is still hopeful.

2,Spy row erupts in Australia over ‘traitor’ politician,SYDNEY: The Australian government faced angry demands on Thursday to name a “traitor” former politician accused...,"SYDNEY: The Australian government faced angry demands on Thursday to name a “traitor” former politician accused by Canberra’s top spy of having “sold out” the country to a foreign power.
In an extraordinary public revelation, Australia’s director-general of security Mike Burgess said a spy team from an unidentified country had cultivated and recruited a former Australian politician.
“This politician sold out their country, party and former colleagues to advance the interests of the foreign regime,” the spy chief said in a speech in Canberra on Wednesday.
Australia is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group that includes the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand — making it a juicy target for operatives from countries such as China and Russia.
Burgess, who runs the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, said the unidentified former politician had been recruited “several years ago”.
The person had even proposed bringing a prime minister’s family member into the “spies’ orbit”, a plan that did not proceed, he said.
The former politician did, however, organise an overseas conference at which spies posing as bureaucrats targeted participants for recruitment, eventually obtaining security and defence information from an academic, Burgess said.
The remarks unleashed speculation in the media and demands for the former politician to be identified.
“The trouble is, if he does not indicate the name then there is a cloud hanging over everybody else,” conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton told Sydney radio station 2GB.
“If you are putting that detail out there as Mr Burgess has done, I think it is incumbent to either give a little bit more criteria or a little bit more of a hint as to who the person might be.”
‘Absolutely absurd’
Former Australian conservative treasurer Joe Hockey said all lawmakers had been tainted by the revelation. “The former politician is a traitor,” he told national broadcaster ABC.
It is “inconceivable” that the politician could be allowed to “walk off into the sunset without having their name, or their reputation revealed”, he said.
Burgess’s revelation had “besmirched” all politicians, said Hockey, who was also Australia’s ambassador to the United States for four years until 2020.
“He should not do that if he is not going to name that person — it’s absurd, it’s absolutely absurd.”
Defence Minister Richard Marles said he did not know the name of the former politician. “I respect what ASIO have done here in terms of putting this story into the public domain but also maintaining the confidentiality of the facts around this, and there could be a whole lot of reasons why that should happen,” he told reporters.
Treasurer Jim Chalmers said he would not “second guess” the ASIO boss.
“I know Mike Burgess, I work with Mike Burgess, and I know that he wouldn’t have said this without good reason, and he wouldn’t have couched it this way if he didn’t think that was absolutely necessary,” he said.
In his Canberra address, Burgess said a foreign intelligence service unit, dubbed “the A-Team”, had made Australia its “priority target”.
The unit had targeted Aust­ralians with access to “privileged information” on social networking sites using “false, anglicised personas” and pro­m­ising cash rewards, he said.
“The spies pose as consultants, head-hunters, local government officials, academics and think tank researchers, claiming to be from fictional companies such as Data 31,” he added.

3,Putin warns West of nuclear war risk,MOSCOW: President Vladimir Putin told Western countries on Thursday they risked provoking a nuclear war if they sent...,"MOSCOW: President Vladimir Putin told Western countries on Thursday they risked provoking a nuclear war if they sent troops to fight in Ukraine, warning that Moscow had the weapons to strike targets in the West.
The war in Ukraine has triggered the worst crisis in Moscow’s relations with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Putin has previously spoken of the dangers of a direct confrontation between the Nato military alliance and Russia, but his nuclear warning on Thursday was one of his most explicit.
Addressing lawmakers and other members of the country’s elite, Putin, 71, repeated his accusation that the West was bent on weakening Russia, and he suggested Western leaders did not understand how dangerous their meddling could be in what he cast as Russia’s own internal affairs.
He prefaced his nuclear warning with a specific reference to an idea, floated by French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, of European Nato members sending ground troops to Ukraine — a suggestion that was quickly rejected by the United States, Germany, Britain and others.
“(Western nations) must realise that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory. All this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons and the destruction of civilisation. Don’t they get that?!” said Putin.
More troops for Western border
Russian forces now had the initiative on the battlefield in Ukraine and were advancing in several places, Putin said. Russia must also boost the troops it has deployed along its western borders with the European Union after Finland and Sweden decided to join Nato, he added.
The veteran Kremlin leader dismissed Western suggestions that Russian forces might go beyond Ukraine and attack European countries as “nonsense”. He also said Moscow would not repeat the mistake of the Soviet Union and allow the West to “drag” it into an arms race that would eat up too much of its budget.
Putin said Moscow was open to discussions on nuclear strategic stability with the United States, but suggested that Washington had no genuine interest in such talks and was more focused on making false claims about Moscow’s alleged aims.
