0,24 migrants drown in shipwreck off Senegal,"SAINT LOUIS: At least 24 people seeking to reach Europe drowned off northern Senegal when their loaded vessel sank,...","SAINT LOUIS: At least 24 people seeking to reach Europe drowned off northern Senegal when their loaded vessel sank, the governor of the Saint Louis region said on Thursday.
Governor Alioune Badara Samb said 24 bodies had been found since Wednesday when the boat got into difficulty in a particularly dangerous part of the northern coast. He added that 21 people had been rescued.
The Saint Louis estuary, where the Senegal River meets the Atlantic Ocean, is notorious for strong currents and areas of thick mud. Samb did not say how many people were missing from the vessel, which witnesses said could have been carrying more than 300 people.
A number of survivors managed to reach shore and dispersed among locals on the sea banks, making it difficult to say exactly how many people were involved, he said.
Mamady Dianfo, a survivor from Casamance in the south, said more than 300 people were on board when the boat left Senegal a week ago. Another survivor, Alpha Balde, estimated there were more than 200 passengers.
Dianfo said the vessel reached Morocco, further north up the coast but the captain then said he was lost and could no longer continue the journey. “We asked him to take us back to Senegal,” he said.
President Macky Sall expressed his  “deep sadness” following the  “tragic capsizing” in a message on X, formerly Twitter. He added that the relevant authorities had been deployed to offer support and assistance.
Senegal’s coast is an increasingly common departure point for Africans fleeing poverty and unemployment and heading to the Canary Islands, their port of entry into Europe. European Union border agency Frontex says Senegal and Morocco are the most common countries of origin for migrants arriving on the Spanish archipelago in the Atlantic.

1,India seeks release of citizens ‘stuck’ in Russian army,NEW DELHI: India said on Thursday it was working to secure discharges for around 20 of its citizens  “stuck” in...,"NEW DELHI: India said on Thursday it was working to secure discharges for around 20 of its citizens  “stuck” in the Russian army, after reports that several were sent to fight in Ukraine.
Two years after Russia’s invasion began, tens of thousands of its soldiers have been killed in Ukraine and Moscow is on a global quest for more combatants. Several Indian recruits said this month they were lured into joining up by promises of high salaries and a Russian passport before being shipped to the frontlines.
“It is our understanding that 20-odd people are stuck,” foreign ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal told reporters in New Delhi. “We are trying our level best for early discharge. We are in regular touch with Russian authorities both here in Delhi and in Moscow.” 
The ministry confirmed last week that an unspecified number of Indian nationals had signed up for  “support jobs” in the Russian army. It said several had already been discharged as a result of its interventions with Russian authorities.
Neither India nor Russia has explicitly confirmed whether they were deployed to fight the war in Ukraine. Jaiswal said the ministry had  “told people not to venture into the war zone”.
The soldiers said they had been promised non-combatant roles but were trained to use Kalashnikov assault rifles and other weapons before being sent to Ukraine. A Russian-language defence ministry contract, signed by the men refers to  “military service in the armed forces of the Russian Federation”, with a requirement to  “participate in hostilities” and  “serve the Russian people without limit”.

2,Proposal to cool earth by blocking sun withdrawn,UN Environment Assembly says the use of solar radiation modification involved health risks.,"NAIROBI: UN delegates on Thursday withdrew a motion calling for more research into technologies that aim to fight climate change by reflecting the sun’s rays back into space, amid concerns about health and environmental risks.
Some who opposed the draft resolution at the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) were also worried that the use of solar radiation modification (SRM) might let big polluters off the hook, organisations watching the debate said.
Switzerland and Monaco first tabled the resolution on examining the geoengineering technology in December and it was discussed during this week’s assembly in Nairobi.
The original version called for the convening of an expert group that would produce a report examining SRM’s possible applications, risks and ethical considerations.

UN Environment Assembly says the use of solar radiation modification involved health risks

One of the best known proposals for using it involves blasting sulphur dioxide — a coolant — into the higher reaches of the atmosphere.
There are only a handful of small SRM projects in operation. Some scientists say SRM could be made available when necessary to avert climate tipping points.
Critics are worried about possible impacts on weather patterns and agriculture, especially in poorer countries. They also fear SRM could serve as an excuse to delay cutbacks on greenhouse gas emissions.
After going through six revisions over the past two weeks, the resolution was withdrawn on Thursday.
Robin Poll, a spokesperson for Switzerland’s Federal Office for the Environment, said countries disagreed on how to facilitate better access to information on SRM and  “if the gathering of information should only focus on risk and uncertainties or could as well include potential benefits”.
“We regret that UNEA couldn’t come to a conclusion on this important matter. However, the discussions have been informative and useful and we managed to start a global conversation about this important topic,” he said.
Ali Mohamed, Kenya’s climate envoy, said African countries opposed the resolution.
“The science is very, very nascent, and the risks are unknown,” he said.  “At this stage, there are many solutions to the regulation of greenhouse gases.”  The Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL) said the European Union, Pacific Island states, Colombia and Mexico also came out against the resolution.
“These technologies cannot tackle the root causes of the climate crisis and would instead enable major polluters to delay the urgent need to phase out fossil fuels,” Mary Church, Senior Geoengineering Campaigner at CIEL, said.—

3,"Serial failings allowed UK police officer to commit rape, murder",LONDON: A public inquiry into a British police officer whose rape and murder of a woman horrified the nation...,"LONDON: A public inquiry into a British police officer whose rape and murder of a woman horrified the nation concluded on Thursday that without a sweeping overhaul of failed vetting procedures, there was nothing to stop another similar case arising.
Wayne Couzens, 51, whose job was to guard diplomatic premises in London, is serving a full life sentence in jail after being convicted of the 2021 rape and murder of Sarah Everard, whom he abducted from a London street using his police credentials to force her into his car.
He subsequently pleaded guilty to three unrelated charges of exposing himself. In total the inquiry found eight such offences had been reported, but not acted upon, prior to the killing of Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive.
Elish Angiolini, who headed the inquiry, said serial failings in the vetting and investigations of Couzens meant that red flags were repeatedly missed, but he  “could and should” have been stopped.

4,US House okays bill to avert shutdown,"While both chambers’ leaders agreed on the measure, there are potential stumbling blocks in the Senate.","WASHINGTON: The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives on Thursday approved a bill to avert a partial government shutdown, sending the measure to the Democratic-majority Senate less than two days before funding for some federal agencies runs out.
Two-hundred and seven Democrats joined 113 Republicans in a 320-99 vote to approve the short-term stopgap measure, which would extend by one week federal funding that expires at 0500 GMT on Saturday and set a March 22 funding deadline for other government agencies.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he hoped his chamber would pass the bill, known as a continuing resolution, or “CR”, and forward it to President Joe Biden to sign it into law.
While both chambers’ leaders agreed on the measure, there are potential stumbling blocks in the Senate, where some hardline Republicans are expected to demand amendment votes in exchange for their consent to fast-track the bill.
The stopgap, the fourth needed to keep federal agencies open in the fiscal year that began on Oct 1, is intended to give the House and Senate time to pass 12 appropriations bills to fund the government.

5,Asia’s richest man launches lavish pre-wedding party in India,"Global tech CEOs, industry titans, Bollywood stars, pop icons and politicians are expected to jet in for the main three-day celebrations hosted by Mukesh Ambani.","NEW DELHI: India’s richest man has kicked off lavish pre-wedding parties for his son by feeding more than 50,000 people in his hometown, with celebrations in the coming days expected to include some of the world’s most influential figures.
Global tech CEOs, industry titans, Bollywood stars, pop icons and politicians are expected to jet in Friday for the main three-day celebrations hosted by billionaire tycoon Mukesh Ambani, who is building a sprawling Hindu temple complex for the event.
Ambani, 66, chairman of oil-to-telecoms giant Reliance Industries, is Asia’s richest person according to the Forbes real-time billionaires list, worth more than $114 billion.
On Wednesday evening, Ambani and wife Nita — along with their son Anant and his fiancee Radhika Merchant — launched a three-day feast for villagers at the Reliance Township in his hometown of Jamnagar, in India’s western state of Gujarat.
Anant, 28, who also serves as a director on the boards of several Reliance-owned firms, is expected to marry Merchant, 29, the daughter of an industrialist, later this year.
Ambani held the most expensive wedding in India for his daughter in 2018, which reportedly cost $100 million and saw US pop megastar Beyonce perform. This time, R&B star Rihanna, illusionist David Blaine and Bollywood’s Diljit Dosanjh will perform for the guests, who are expected to include Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Meta head Mark Zuckerberg, and several current and former political leaders, according to a list released by Reliance.
Also among the invitees is Disney chief Robert Iger, following a deal agreed Wednesday between Reliance Industries and Walt Disney to merge their Indian media businesses. The merger will create a $8.5 billion entertainment giant in the world’s most populous nation and fifth-largest economy.
Other guests invited include Ivanka Trump, the former US president’s daughter, as well as ex-Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt, former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and the King of Bhutan.
Bollywood stars Amitabh Bachchan and Shahrukh Khan, cricket icons Sachin Tendulkar and M. S. Dhoni, and industry titan Gautam Adani are also invited in a who’s-who of India’s super-rich elite.
The Ambanis are building a Hindu temple complex in Jamnagar, to keep  “India’s rich cultural and spiritual identity at the heart of the wedding festivities”, the Reliance Foundation said on social media.
The main celebrations, running from March 1-3, will have different themes, events and dress codes — including a  “jungle fever” day with a visit to an animal rescue centre run by Ambani, the Hindustan Times newspaper reported.

6,Gridlock-prone Lagos gets new train line,"LAGOS: Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu on Thursday launched a new train line in Lagos, the country’s most...","LAGOS: Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu on Thursday launched a new train line in Lagos, the country’s most populous city, which is struggling with poor public transport and huge traffic jams.
The Red Line is the second urban rail link in Nigeria’s economic capital and 
officials say it will eventually carry around 500,000 passengers a day. The first 37-kilometre (23-mile) stretch links eight stations between the northern Agbado district in neighbouring Ogun state with the Oyingbo district in the heart of the megacity.
Tinubu said the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority had  “demonstrated that agencies of government 
can be made to succeed and work for the people.”  “There’s more work to be done,” he said, warning there was  “no room for complacency.” From a population of around 200,000 in the 1960s, Lagos now has more than 20 million inhabitants and is neck and neck with Kinshasa in the 
DR Congo for the title of Africa’s most populous city.
The Climate Central NGO says Lagos could become the world’s most populous city by 2100. More public train, bus and ferry links are considered vital to curb the lagoon-side city’s heaving traffic.
The Red Line joins the Blue Line, which opened in September 2023 and can carry up to 250,000 people a day from Marina on Lagos Island to the Mile 2 area on the mainland. The two lines are set to be part of a vast citywide transit network, with another five train lines due to open over the next few years.

7,US Supreme Court to hear Trump’s immunity claim,Judge orders ex-president excluded from primary ballot in Illinois.,"WASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court agreed on Wednesday to hear Donald Trump’s claim that as a former president he is immune from prosecution, further delaying his trial on charges of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.
Trump had been scheduled to go on trial in Washington on March 4, but the nation’s highest court scheduled arguments in the high-stakes case for the week of April 22 and said Trump’s federal election interference trial would remain on hold for now. 
On the same day, a judge in the state of Illinois ordered the former president stricken off the state’s primary ballot for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot.
Today, both Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden are due to pay dueling visits to the US-Mexico border Thursday as they try to win over voters on immigration, one of the most divisive issues of the presidential election.

Judge orders ex-president excluded from primary ballot in Illinois

The 77-year-old who is currently the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, welcomed the Supreme Court decision to hear the case.
“Without Presidential Immunity, a President will not be able to properly function, or make decisions, in the best interest of the United States of America,” he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. 
The Supreme Court said it would address the question of whether a former president has “immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.” A ruling is expected by the end of the court’s current term in June.
A three-judge appeals court panel ruled earlier this month that a former president has no immunity from prosecution for actions taken while in the White House.
Trump’s claim to be immune from criminal liability is “unsupported by precedent, history or the text and structure of the Constitution,” the judges said in a unanimous opinion.
“We cannot accept that the office of the Presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter,” they said.
The question of whether a former US president is immune from prosecution is an untested one in American jurisprudence because until Trump, an ex-president had never been charged with a crime.
Illinois primary exclusion
The decision by Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter comes as similar anti-Trump ballot measures have cropped up in several states, including a Colorado ruling now before the US Supreme Court.
The question before the nine US justices is whether Trump, the presumed Republican presidential candidate, is ineligible to appear on the Republican presidential primary ballot in Colorado because he engaged in an insurrection – the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol by his supporters.
Earlier this month, the high court signaled it was skeptical of the Colorado ruling.
Trump blasted the Illinois decision as politically motivated and unjust.
“Democrat front-groups continue to attempt to interfere in the election and deny President Trump his rightful place on the ballot,” Trump’s campaign said, vowing to appeal the decision.
Anticipating pushback, the judge in Illinois put her decision on pause until Friday to allow an appeal.

8,Legitimacy test for rulers as Iran goes to polls today,"Heavyweight moderates, conservatives stay out of race; reformists shun the vote, labelling it ‘unfree and unfair’.","• Heavyweight moderates, conservatives stay out of race; reformists shun the vote, labelling it ‘unfree and unfair’
• Economic hardships, high inflation and discontent with living standards pose challenges                       
DUBAI: Iran holds a parliamentary election on Friday seen as a test of the clerical establishment’s popularity at a time of growing dissent over an array of political, social and economic crises. 
The vote will be the first formal gauge of public opinion after anti-government protests in 2022-23 spiralled into some of the worst political turmoil since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. 
Critics from inside and outside the ruling elite, including politicians and former lawmakers, say the legitimacy of Iran’s theocratic system could be at stake due to economic struggles and a lack of electoral options for a mostly young population chafing at political and social restrictions. 
Iran’s top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has called voting a religious duty. He accused the country’s “enemies” — a term he normally uses for the United States and Israel — of trying to create despair among Iranian voters. 
The commander of the country’s elite Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami, said on Wednesday that “each vote is like a missile launched at the enemy’s heart”. 
But Iranians still have painful memories of the handling of nationwide unrest sparked by the death in custody of a young Iranian-Kurdish woman in 2022, which was quelled by a violent state crackdown involving mass detentions and even executions. 
Economic hardships pose another challenge. Many analysts say that millions have lost hope that Iran’s ruling clerics can resolve an economic crisis fomented by a combination of US sanctions, mismanagement and corruption. 
While establishment supporters will likely vote for hardline candidates, widespread public anger at worsening living standards and pervasive graft may keep many Iranians at home. 
Prices for basic goods like bread, meat, dairy and rice have skyrocketed in past months. The official inflation rate stands at about 40 per cent. Analysts and insiders put it at over 50pc. 
The US 2018 withdrawal from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers, and its re-imposition of sanctions, have hit Iran’s economy hard. Efforts to revive the pact have failed. 
Reformists shun ‘meaningless’ vote
Iranian activists and opposition groups are distributing the Twitter hashtags #VOTENoVote widely on social media, arguing that a high turnout will legitimise the Islamic Republic. 
With heavyweight moderates and conservatives staying out of Friday’s race and reformists calling it an “unfree and unfair election”, the vote will pit hardliners and low-key conservatives against each other, all proclaiming loyalty to Iran’s Islamic revolutionary ideals. 
The interior ministry said 15,200 candidates will run for the 290-seat parliament, with a vetting body called the Guardian Council approving 75pc of initially registered hopefuls. 
The unelected Guardian Council, made up of six clerics and six legal experts generally within Khamenei’s orbit, has the authority to scrutinise laws and election candidates. 
Ballots will mostly be counted manually, so the final result may not be announced for three days, although partial results may appear sooner. 
On the same day, Iranians also vote for the Assembly of Experts, which appoints and can dismiss the supreme leader. The 88-member clerical body rarely intervenes directly in policy but is expected to help choose the 84-year-old Khamenei’s successor. 
Parliament has no major influence on foreign policy or Iran’s nuclear agenda. These are determined by Khamenei who holds the utmost authority in the country’s unique dual system of clerical and republican rule. 
Polling has projected turnover of about 41pc, while former lawmaker Mahmoud Sadeghi said on Monday that surveys showed the participation could be as low as 27pc, significantly lower than 42pc in a 2020 parliamentary vote. 
Discredited after years of failed attempts at widening political and social freedoms, the pro-reform opposition suffered further unpopularity in 2022 when protesters scorned its mantra of gradual change. 
The Reform Front coalition has said it will not take part in the “meaningless” election but has not boycotted the vote.

9,Kashmiri journalist freed after five years,Asif Sultan released following a delay of over two months after high court quashes his detention due to procedural lapses.,"Kashmiri journalist Asif Sultan, one of first media professionals booked under a stringent anti-terror law, was released from jail after being incarcerated for over five years, reported The Independent on Thursday.
The paper said he was released on Tuesday following a delay of over two months after the Jammu and Kashmir High Court quashed his detention due to procedural lapses.
Sultan had been incarcerated for over five years in a jail in Uttar Pradesh’s Ambedkar Nagar district. His continued detention even after the High Court’s decision was attributed to the pending arrival of “clearance letters” from the home department and the Srinagar district magistrate.
In September 2018, Sultan was detained under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), accused of offering logistical aid to a prohibited militant organisation. Four years later, on April 5, 2022, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court approved his release on bail, citing the investigative agencies’ inability to prove his association with any militant group.
However, just four days after this decision, the district magistrate of Srinagar ordered his detention under the Public Safety Act (PSA).
On December 11, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court annulled Sultan’s detention under the PSA, stating that the necessary procedural steps were not adequately followed.
According to this law, individuals can be detained without trial for up to two years for national security reasons and up to a year to maintain public order. Justice Vinod Chatterji Koul noted that the authorities seemed to consider the case against Sultan under the anti-terror law while detaining him under the Public Safety Act, but failed to provide him with essential documents like the FIR or statements recorded under Section 161 of the criminal procedure.
This omission prevented Sultan from effectively challenging his detention order.
