0,NA win sets stage for Shehbaz election tomorrow,"Newly-stitched ruling alliance comfortably clinches speaker, deputy posts in NA","In what appeared to be a dress rehearsal of the election of the prime minister, the newly-stitched ruling alliance passed the first test of showing its numerical strength on Friday when their nominees for the speaker and deputy speaker slots sailed through without any hiccup.
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarian (PPPP) clinched the two top positions in the National Assembly as PML-N’s Ayaz Sadiq and PPPP’s Ghulam Mustafa Shah were elected speaker and deputy speaker, respectively, on NA’s second day of the inaugural session.
The result of the election of the speaker and deputy speaker was a forgone conclusion as both Sadiq and Shah were the joint candidates of the PML-N, PPPP, and MQM-P, among others, who have clear numerical superiority over the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed candidates sitting in assembly under the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) banner.
Sadiq and Shah defeated the SIC’s Amir Dogar and Junaid Akbar with a comfortable margin as Sadiq bagged 199 votes while Shah secured 197 votes during speaker and deputy speaker’s elections.
Dogar got 91 while Akbar secured 92 votes during the polls. Apparently, the day witnessed elections on key posts but the actual task was to check if the numbers were complete before the March 3 elections when the lawmakers would elect a new leader of the house – the new prime minister.
A notable positive highlight of the day occurred when Sadiq embraced Dogar upon winning the speaker election. The moment stood out in contrast to the remainder of the day's proceedings, which were tainted by the customary exchange of slogans against each other's leaders and resorting to personal attacks.
However, in a matter of seconds, PTI-SIC member Sher Afzal Marwat began vociferously chanting the slogan ""mandate chor (thief)"" as Sadiq engaged with PTI-SIC members seated in the front row.
Similar to the opening day of the inaugural session a day ago, the echoes of slogans such as ""chor"" (thief) and ""ghari chor"" (watch thief) persisted in the assembly hall all day. The chants were among other slogans voiced in support of two major political players: PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif and PTI's founding chairman Imran Khan.
SIC members kept resorting to calling opponents ""chor"" (thief) — a reference to corruption allegations that have been chasing Sharifs and others over the years — while the PMLN-led alliance kept responding with Ghari Chor — watch thief — a reference to the Toshakhana case where Imran has been accused to selling a watch gifted by Saudi royals.
Following the election of the speaker, outgoing Speaker NA Raja Pervez Ashraf administered the oath to Sadiq. Subsequently, Sadiq presided over the deputy speaker's elections and administered the oath to Shah after he secured an easy victory.
Throughout the day, Ashraf delivered his farewell speech, Sadiq assumed charge from him, Dogar delivered a scathing speech, and Mahmood Khan Achakzai's address was characterised as belligerent.
Achakzai not only called for an end to powerful stakeholders' roles in politics but also demanded the release of the PTI founding chairman.
Ashraf has served from April 2022 till March 1, 2024. He had replaced PTI’s then-speaker Asad Qaiser after then-PTI’s PM Imran Khan was ousted through a vote of no-confidence. His 23-month-long tenure has ended. In his farewell speech, he thanked the party heads for expressing trust in him.
In his first address to the 16th National Assembly after assuming the role of speaker, Sadiq emphasised the importance of collective efforts for the betterment of Pakistan. Speaker Sadiq underlined the significance of unity among members of the House, regardless of political affiliations.
“Both the government and opposition play vital roles in the parliament. All members must set aside their differences and work together constructively to propel Pakistan forward,” he stated.

Reaffirming his commitment to constitutional principles and the rule of law, Speaker Sadiq pledged to fulfil his duties with integrity, ensuring the impartial functioning of the National Assembly.
Openly inviting all members to engage in constructive dialogue, Speaker Sadiq urged the members of the House to refrain from personal criticism, promoting a spirit of unity and cooperation. ""This House thrives on the contributions of every member, and I urge all to participate in constructive debate for the greater good,"" he stated.
After the oath, Sadiq took charge and assumed the office of the speaker NA, amid desk thumping. “Say thank you to boots as well,” PTI-SIC leader Marwat quipped as the newly-elected NA speaker thanked different party leaders as well as all those whom he finds close to his heart.
Sadiq, in a polite tone, urged the newly-elected lawmakers to criticise the decisions but should refrain from resorting to personal attacks. Offering that his office was open for all, he urged them to work together for the betterment of the country.
Throughout the day, PMLN supremo Nawaz Sharif entered the assembly hall only to cast a vote for the speaker and deputy speaker amid loud slogans of “sher, sher” – lion, lion. On both occasions, Sharif was surrounded by a group of party leaders.
Meanwhile, Asif Ali Zardari, the PPPP President and would-be President of the country, also cast his vote. His son Bilawal Bhutto accompanied him.
Not a single slogan was raised either in favour or against Zardari even when he walked past the benches where SIC members were seated.
Shahbaz Sharif, the would-be candidate for the PM’s slot, also cast a vote amid sloganeering from both sides. Shehbaz was surrounded by his party members while PTI-SIC while holding Imran Khan’s posters started shouting slogans standing near the speaker’s desk.
PTI-backed candidates, including Sher Afzal Marwat, also held shoes in their hands while shouting ""chor chor"".
PML-N and PTI-backed candidates were standing against each other when Shehbaz decided to leave the assembly hall after he cast his vote. Subsequently, the sloganeering suddenly ended and legislators went back to their seats.
Meanwhile, Dogar while congratulating Sadiq said that PTI-SIC participated despite being deprived of seats, including reserve seats. Had the results come as per FORM 45, Dogar said, his votes would have been 225.
Till this morning, Dogar revealed, 91 members who voted for him were under severe pressure but still decided to stand by him till the end.
“This wasn’t election but selection,” Dogar said while referring to general elections and questioned what was the need to spend Rs50 billion on elections if the decision was to be made by those tasked to count votes rather than those who cast them.
He demanded to give back PTI-SIC won seats, saying the party was ready to cooperate.
Referring to the speaker’s offer of reconciliation, Dogar while paying tribute to Imran Khan’s struggle said that Imran has given the go-ahead for reconciliation but has linked it with the demand that PTI’s mandate should first be handed back.
Meanwhile, a group of PTI-SIC members initiated chants of ""Lota, Lota"" when Aleem Khan, their former party colleague who currently leads IPP, approached to cast his vote.
Ironically, many observers in the press gallery pointed out that Umar Ayub, the PTI-SIC candidate for the premiership, exhibited audacity in labelling others as turncoats, considering his own history of switching parties multiple times over the years.

1,Khan’s diehard loyalist elected K-P CM with two-thirds majority,"Gandapur announces revival of Sehat Card, reopening of panagahs and langarkhanas","Ali Amin Gandapur, a diehard loyalist of jailed PTI founder Imran Khan, was elected the 20th chief minister of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa with a two-thirds majority on Friday in a provincial assembly session which witnessed vociferous sloganeering in favour of “Qaidee No 804”, a reference to the former prime minister who has been serving an extended jail term at Adiala Jail on several charges that his beleaguered party claims are all trumped up.
The election for the provincial chief executive was a face-off between Ali Amin Gandapur and the opposition’s Dr Abidullah, but ended up being a one-sided affair as Gandapur bagged 90 votes, while his challenger could grab only 16 votes. Lawmakers from Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s eponymous faction of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam stayed away from the process.
The assembly session, which started with one-and-a-half-hour delay, was officiated by Speaker Babar Salim Swati. He restricted the entry of unauthorised people into the house before the commencement of the session, while media persons were guided to the press gallery.
The speaker allowed absenting MPAs five minutes to ensure attendance. Soon after this hiatus, bells were rung in the assembly for five minutes and the main hall doors were closed soon after. Initially, four MPAs: Ali Amin Gandapur, Hisham Inamullah, Zark Khan, and Abidullah, had submitted their nominations for the chief minister's election. However, Khan and Inamullah later withdrew their papers, leaving Gandapur and Inamullah in the race.
Speaker Swati explained the election process whereby those voting for Dr Abidullah would go to Lobby No 1, while those voting for Gandapur would go to Lobby No 2. The speaker then summoned the MPAs back into the house to announce the results, whereby Gandapur was declared the winner with an overwhelming majority. Gandapur was formally sworn in soon after his election as the chief minister.
While speaking on the floor of the house after securing the office, Gandapur spelled out the priorities of his administration. He announced the revival of the Sehat Card, something that has politically benefited the PTI immensely in the impoverished province. He also announced the reopening of Panahgahs and Langarkhanas that Imran Khan had opened throughout the country for the shelter-less and the destitute as part of his vision for an Islamic welfare state.
The new chief minister called for immediate resignation of the chief election commissioner for his failure to hold transparent and credible elections. “I would offer myself first if any electoral fraud is established against me. Then I shall offer my province,” he added. Gandapur called for an audit of the vote, saying that stealing a mandate is not only a violation of the Constitution but also a betrayal to the public.

Gandapur said that he was cognizant of the myriad challenges faced by K-P, a province wrecked by a deadly reign of the Taliban terrorism. He stressed the establishment of peace and security as the foremost task, asserting that without peace, a good roads infrastructure becomes irrelevant. He promised to reform those who resort to terrorism.
Gandapur singled out corruption as the most serious challenge that gnaws at the roots of good governance. He called on all elected representatives of his party to pledge under an oath that they would carry forward a crusade of their party chief against corruption in the province.
He said that nations could not stand on their feet by borrowing money from lenders. “We will increase our revenues by taxing the rich to provide relief to the poor,” he added.  The new CM pledged to stand up for the rights of the province. “If we (K-P) are denied our due share, then nobody will be allowed to exploit our mineral resources,” he said amid thunderous applause from party supporters in the visitors’ gallery.
“If we are not given what belongs to us, then this august house should be ready to wrest its rights,” Gandapur said in a veiled reference to the federal government led by PTI’s arch nemesis whom it accuses of stealing its mandate in connivance with the powers that be.
Gandapur also expressed his gratitude to Imran Khan for reposing trust in him and assured that he would utilise all his energies to live up to Khan’s expectations. He lamented that Khan, who is a proponent of freedom, justice, and welfare of the common man, has been “unjustly imprisoned”. Gandapur demanded an open and fair trial for Khan. The PTI claims that its founder has been denied his constitutional right to fair trial and was jailed on trumped-up charges through unprecedented marathon trials in a haste.
The new chief minister, who himself is facing several court cases, slammed the system for not changing despite the efforts from the PTI. In the same breath, he warned: “If we fail to change the system, then the people will hold us accountable.”
Gandapur called on everyone to focus on the mandate given by the people and urged the opposition to raise their voices for the rights of the province inside and outside the assembly. However, he warned that if the opposition tried to create unnecessary roadblocks on the province’s march to progress, then his administration would deal with them accordingly.

2,Alvi resents Kakar’s 'tone and tenor',Objects to ‘unacceptable language’ in NA summary," 
On Wednesday, President Dr Arif Alvi, while signing a summary sent by Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar for summoning the inaugural session of the 16th National Assembly, expressed dissatisfaction with the ""tone and tenor"" of the interim PM. Dr Alvi noted that Kakar had resorted to ""unacceptable language"" and baseless allegations.

A press release issued by the President’s Secretariat on Wednesday night stated that the president summoned the NA session with some reservations. ""The president accorded his approval while keeping in view the mandate and implications of the timeline given in Article 91(2) and subject to some reservations and expecting the resolution of the issue of the reserved seats before the 21st day.""

Dr Alvi had earlier returned a summary moved by the caretaker government due to the non-allocation of reserved seats to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), a party comprising PTI-backed independent lawmakers. However, the president signed the second such summary in a change of heart.

The statement said, ""While responding to the summary…, the president said that the tone and tenor of the honorable caretaker prime minister of Pakistan was unfortunate.""

He took exception to the contents of the summary, stating, ""Summaries are not usually addressed in this way. It is sad that the chief executive of the country addresses the head of the state in the first form and resorts to unacceptable language and allegations without any substance.""

The statement said the president believed and always maintained the principle of objectivity and neutrality in accordance with his oath and responsibilities under the Constitution and could not be oblivious of some incongruities in the electoral and government formation processes.

It noted that the president has to keep national interest in his view, for cohesiveness and betterment of the nation, adding that the return of the first summary was very much in accordance with the provisions of Article 48(1) of the Constitution.
""It is not understood on what grounds it [the decision to return the first summary] has been taken as a partisan act, though it was also aimed at the completion of the National Assembly in accordance with Article 51 of the Constitution, so that people of Pakistan are not deprived of taking part in the executive decisions of the country through their representatives as enshrined in the Objectives Resolution.""

The president stated that he did not wish to indulge himself or delve into the baseless accusations of constitutional violation attributed in the summary.

 “It was needless to remind that a caretaker prime minister/set-up is merely responsible to ensure conducive conditions for the peaceful, fair and transparent holding of general elections, within the framework of the Constitution and the timeline on which many quarters had expressed reservations.

The president stated that he fully realized that the Constitution of Pakistan must be implemented in letter and spirit, though it was not being done so in case of the existing electoral process.

He reiterated his stance about the provisions of the Constitution such as Article 51 and clause 2 of Article 91 to be followed by all and given effect in letter and spirit.

""Of late the Election Commission of Pakistan is seized of the exercise contemplated by Article 51 of the Constitution, the outcome of which was awaited and expected by the 21st day as envisaged in Article 91(2). However, till this time no decision has been made by the commission,” he said,

3,Petrol price jacked up by Rs4.13 per litre,Interim govt keeps diesel rate unchanged,"The outgoing caretaker government on Thursday increased the prices of petrol by over Rs4.13 per litre, effective from March 1, 2024. However, it maintained the price of high-speed diesel (HSD), light diesel oil (LDO) and kerosene oil.
According to a notification issued by the finance ministry, the price of petrol was increased as per the recommendation of the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
After the hike, the price of petrol reached Rs279.75 while HSD is available at Rs287.33.
The Express Tribune had reported that the price of petrol may go up due to expected exchange rate adjustment.

The report said that the oil price revisions are based on a higher premium, exchange rate adjustment, and the current petroleum levy and general sales tax (GST) rate on petroleum products.
The import premium on petrol is estimated at $10.48 per barrel, whereas the premium on high-speed diesel is estimated at $6.50 per barrel. The government is charging Rs60 per litre petroleum levy on both.
The inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) is Rs7.52 per litre on petrol and Rs3.92 per litre on high-speed diesel.
The sale of total petroleum products in Pakistan clocked in at 1.38 million tonnes in January, a decline of 4% year-on-year compared to 1.44 million in the same period of the previous year. The decline comes on the back of lower petrol and diesel sales.
