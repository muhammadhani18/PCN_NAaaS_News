The police have registered a case and arrested the nominated suspect, Ameer Khan on the complaint of the victim’s uncle Ijaz Sheikh.

“The man put his hand on my mouth and ordered me to keep quiet, but I gathered all the strength and shouted for help,” she said, adding that the culprit tortured her but she kept crying for help, on which he panicked and ran away. The victim said, “My uncle and I give free education to poor children in Gulshan-e-Hadeed. We have built a free madresa in our house.”

1,772nd Urs of Shahbaz Qalandar begins,Around three million visitors from across the country expected to attend,"The 772nd Urs of Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar has begun in Sehwan, drawing millions of devotees from across the country. The air in Sehwan resonates with the spiritual melodies of ‘Dama Dum Mast Qalandar’.
Shehbaz Milad Committee Chairman and Deputy Commissioner Jamshwar Ali Zulfiqar Memon remarked on the exceptional turnout of devotees despite the cold weather this year.
It is estimated that around three million people will participate in the Urs this year for which stringent security arrangements have been made to ensure peace and order.
Thousands of devotees have set up temporary settlements in a form of camps and tents in various areas of the city, including Lal Bagh, Yak Thanbi, Railway Station, and College Road. Many people, including women and children, have set up makeshift shelters along the roads.
Numerous devotees are making their way to the shrine barefoot, offering floral tributes and engaging in Sufi dance performances to the rhythmic beats of drums on the city streets.
The ambiance of the entire city is filled with chants of ‘Mast Qalandar Lal’, while the city has been adorned like a bride.
Meanwhile, various businesses have established stalls selling sweets, handicrafts, caps, ajrak, toys, and other souvenirs. The Milad ground hosts recreational activities, including circus performances, captivating the attention of visitors.
However, there have been complaints of exorbitant prices and substandard quality of items sold at the restaurants and stalls. The increase in the number of visitors has also led to a surge in pollution, with garbage accumulating across the city and sanitation conditions deteriorating.
To ensure safety, over 400 CCTV cameras have been installed at strategic locations, and security measures have been intensified. Meanwhile, police have apprehended a group of pickpockets, including five women involved in stealing earrings from female devotees. Pickpockets have targeted thousands of pilgrims, and mobile SIM franchises have raised the price of duplicate SIMs to Rs500.
Moreover, in light of terrorism concerns, sensitive areas such as rest houses and hotels are being regularly monitored, and strict security measures have been enforced.
