0,Gustasap declared winner in NA-15 final tally,MANSEHRA: Returning officer NA-15 Zakir Hussain Jadoon on Thursday confirmed the victory of Pakistan...,"MANSEHRA: Returning officer NA-15 Zakir Hussain Jadoon on Thursday confirmed the victory of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-backed Shahzada Gustasap Khan after formally issuing Form 49.
“This is not only my victory but also of people, workers and leadership of PTI as the returning officer in pursuance of the ECP’s ruling issued Form 49,” Mr Khan was speaking to media persons after receiving the final result.
A two-member bench of ECP comprising Nisar Ahmad Durrani and Babar Hassan Bharwana dismissed the petition of the losing candidate and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday and ordered RO NA-15 to issue consolidated result (Form 49) of NA-15.
According to the result, Shahzada Gustasap Khan could bag as many as 105,259 votes and his close rival and PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif secured 80,413 votes.
Mufti Kifayatullah, a nominee of JUI-F, secured 29,938 votes, while Pakistan People Party’s aspirant Zargul Khan bagged 5,443 votes.
The constituency — NA-15 — is widely spread over the rural parts of Mansehra and neighbouring Torghar district.
According to Form 49, a total of 645,049 men and women voters are registered in the constituency. As many as 247,660 votes were polled and 9,104 of them were rejected.
Shahzada Gustasap Khan along with his supporters reached the RO office and collected the result following which a jubilant crowd distributed sweets among each other.
Mr Khan told the jubilant crowd that it was merely an election process for him and his rival candidate Nawaz Sharif’s son-in-law retired captain Mohammad Safar first misguided him to contest election from here and when he lost with a margin of over 25,000 votes, he compelled him to challenge the result with ECP, saying votes of Torghar were not counted in Form 47.

2,PHC seeks Election Commission’s response to reserved seats plea,"Petitioner insists ECP ""illegally"" delaying allocation of those seats to Sunni Ittehad Council.","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday directed the Election Commission of Pakistan to respond to a petition seeking orders for it to allocate seats reserved for women and non-Muslims to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) in the national, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Punjab assemblies.
A bench consisting of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Wiqar Ahmad took up for preliminary hearing the petition filed by a member of the Insaf Lawyers Forum, Azmatullah Afridi, who requested it to declare illegal the delay on part of the ECP in allocating those reserved seats to the SIC, which was joined by independently-elected members of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf after the Feb 8 general elections.
The bench directed the ECP to respond to the petition within seven days.

Petitioner insists ECP ‘illegally’ delaying allocation of those seats to Sunni Ittehad Council

The counsel for the petitioner, Shah Faisal Uthmankhel, contended that the ECP had deprived the PTI of its election symbol, so the latter challenged the move in the high court.
 
 

He added that the Peshawar High Court declared the decision of the ECP illegal, but the Supreme Court set the high court’s verdict aside on Jan 10 and restored the decision of the ECP.
The lawyer said that after the judgement of the apex court, the PTI’s nominees had to contest the Feb 8 general elections as independents.
He said that in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, the independent candidates backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had a landslide victory in the elections, while they also won seats in the national and Punjab assemblies in large numbers.
Mr Uthmankhel said that the ECP had issued a notification informing the independently-elected MNAs and MPAs that they could join any political party within three days of the publication of election results in the official gazette.
He contended that under the Constitution, the seats reserved for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies should be allocated to political parties on the basis of proportional representation of the number of seats won by a particular political party, and that also included the independently-elected candidates, who joined that party.
The counsel said that those independent lawmakers joined the Sunni Ittehad Council, which was registered with the ECP as a political party.
He argued that the Sunni Ittehad Council was entitled to be allocated seats reserved for women and non-Muslims in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, Election Act, 2017, and Elections Rules, 2017.
Mr Uthmankhel, however, said that the ECP had been delaying the allocation of reserved seats to the Sunni Ittehad Council in clear violation of the Constitution and the law.
He pointed out that the KP Assembly’s session was summoned on Feb 28, whereas the sitting of the National Assembly was called for Feb 29.
The lawyer argued that every vote had assumed importance in the national and provincial assemblies, and therefore, the non-allocation of reserved seats to the SIC was an injustice to their members, who had joined that party.
He said that unless the national and provincial assemblies had full strength, holding elections to their key positions would be unconstitutional.

3,Youth’s murder sparks protest in Lakki Marwat,LAKKI MARWAT: A street protest was staged here on Thursday against the killing of a young man.,"LAKKI MARWAT: A street protest was staged here on Thursday against the killing of a young man.
The protesters, including relatives of the deceased and tribesmen, demanded of authorities to ensure the early arrest of killers for strict punishment.
The body of Ghaniullah, 20, was found near his house in the Fareedkhel area of the Bitanni subdivision. He was killed with a sharp-edged object. He was the son of former nazim, the late Shaukatullah.
Inamullah, a leader of protesters, said unidentified men severely tortured the youth before killing him and dumping his body near his house.
He said that the youth was associated with anti-polio efforts in his area as a volunteer, and his family had no enmity.
A health official told Dawn that the killing had nothing to do with the ongoing campaign for polio eradication.
He said that the youth worked with an anti-polio mobile team.
“He [Ghaniullah] returned home after completing the daylong field assignment of administering the polio vaccine to children on Wednesday,” he said.
An official of the local police insisted that the killers would be tracked down “soon.”
“We have started an investigation into the murder,” he said.
The body was taken to the Tajazai Chowk by the deceased’s relatives and local tribesmen, who were accompanied by the activists of Marwat Bittani Tehreek.
They closed the Peshawar-Karachi Highway to vehicles, suspending traffic for long hours.
The speakers, including Bittani tehsil council chairman Maulana Anwar Badshah, Marwat Bitanni Tehreek chairman Inamullah Khan, JUI-F leader Qari Mohammad Umar and local elder Akhtar Gul Bitanni, denounced the murder and asked police to arrest killers without delay for strict punishment.
The protesters later went to the District Headquarters Complex, where a government team headed by assistant commissioner Najam Dawar and police officials held talks with them.
They said that the police would ensure the arrest of killers within three days for legal action.
The mob dispersed peacefully afterwards.

4,"Govt plans to develop kidney, cardiac health services in DI Khan",Health dept also intends to launch telemedicine project in Peshawar,"PESHAWAR: The provincial government has planned to allocate funds to upgrade and develop kidney, cardiac and burns health services in Dera Ismail and launch telemedicine project in Peshawar during the next four months.
Three of these projects will be executed in the native town of chief minister-designate Ali Amin Khan Gandapur.
The planning and development department has asked health department to inform it about the cost of four projects to be included in the budget, meant from March to June. It has asked health department to submit concept papers and details proposed by the latter last month so that these could be included in the budget.
The schemes, for which health department has already sought funds, include enhancement of angiography and angioplasty services in Cardiology Hospital and development of Burns Centre at Mufti Mahmood Teaching Hospital and increasing capacity of Kidney Centre Dera Ismail Khan.
The fourth project is starting telemedicine programme in health department. The department has been asked to submit the proposed cost of these programmes and the existing available facilities so that these can be included in Annual Development Programme on immediate basis.

Health dept also intends to launch telemedicine project in Peshawar

Officials said that health department wanted to develop those services in Dera Ismail Khan and provide treatment facilities to people in the local hospital. “Currently, patients come to Peshawar for heart ailments because full-fledged services are not available there. Therefore, we have requested inclusion of these schemes, which require attention at the start of financial year. These schemes were dropped from Annual Development Programme due to financial constraints,” they added.
They said that funds would be allocated for the schemes in the native town of chief minister-designate Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, who had already played important role in the establishment of Burns Centre there. Most of the patients with burn injuries were being shifted to Burn and Plastic Surgery Centre Peshawar where finding a bed was not an easy task because it catered to needs of patients from the entire province, they added.
Officials said that Prof Tahmeedullah, the director of Burns and Plastic Surgery Centre, who helped in establishment of burns ward in Dera Ismail Khan, expressed willingness to further enhance those services there and train the staff so that patients could be handled locally. “Prof Tahmeed has been visiting burn wards in districts but it requires the desired financial support,” they said.
Likewise, patients continued to visit Peshawar for cardiac ailments despite the presence of cardiology hospital there, officials said. They said that Prof Shahkar Ahmad Shah, the medical director of Peshawar Institute of Cardiology (PIC), was already working to upgrade cardiac services at the district level hospitals and reduce the burden patients on Peshawar.
Same is case with kidney services as people suffer due to non-availability of full treatment facilities.
“Under these programme, healthcare services in Dera Ismail Khan will be developed as the chief minister belongs to the same district and allocation of the required amount will not be a major issue,” they said.
Officials said that health department was also considering launching telemedicine project. They said that a project was launched in 2018 in Services Hospital but that no longer existed. They added that the project, headed by late Dr Jamal Nasir, benefitted patients of five districts including Karak, Chitral, Battagram, Swabi and Nowshera.
“Telemedicine has been gaining currency worldwide as patients can avail healthcare services through information technology in far-flung areas,” they said.

A policy of zero tolerance has been adopted towards the facilitators of drug smugglers in the police force, read the statement.

PRICE CONTROL: The administration of Khyber tribal district has developed a strategy to check the prices of essential commodities, especially food items, during the coming month of Ramazan to the relief of the people.
During the “Meet the Press” programme at the district press club in Landi Kotal on Thursday, additional assistant commissioner Rameez Ali warned that the district administration wouldn’t tolerate the overpricing of essential commodities, especially edibles and beverages, in Ramazan and would establish price control committees in all markets.
He urged traders and shopkeepers to help the administration and price committees provide relief to the people hit by the high inflation rate.
The representatives of traders and shopkeepers insisted that members of their community wouldn’t fleece customers and would help authorities keep the prices of essential commodities under control besides arranging “sasta bazaars” during Ramazan.
They, however, argued that most edibles and other Ramazan-related items were brought in from Peshawar or Punjab, so traders and shopkeepers couldn’t reduce their prices on their own after procuring them at inflated rates.
The official assured them that the issue would be resolved to benefit both shopkeepers and customers.

They told this scribe that the continuously sliding process of the hill slope was neglected while executing the project. They said that the department of communication and works (C&W) totally neglected the ramshackle position of the hillock from which boulders and debris fell on the road and overran it during rainy days.
They said that many precious were killed while passing through the location when they were hit by boulders from the hillock.
Sajjad Ahmed Khan, chairman of Jughur village council, said that the department of communication and works was executing the project of ‘beautification of Chitral’ launched by the previous government of Pakistan Tarheek-i-Insaf (PTI) costing Rs32 million. He said that the project included Chew Bridge road.
He regretted that a huge amount of money had been spent on the road on trivial structures which like fencing, pavement and lightings using its funds while leaving behind its basic need of containing the fall of rocks to the road.
Mr Khan said that the money could have been spent on the work of rock nailing of the affected portion of the hill which could have added to the beauty of the area and provide a safety to the road once and for all.
He said that rock nailing was the only solution to the problem of falling of rocks, endangering the lives of the passersby and motorists.
A sub-divisional officer of C&W, when contacted, said that the rock nailing item was not approved in the plan of the project due to its high cost. He said it was beyond the scope of the project.
He admitted that only rock nailing structure could provide a permanent solution to the problem while erecting a retaining wall could also serve the purpose with a lower cost.
