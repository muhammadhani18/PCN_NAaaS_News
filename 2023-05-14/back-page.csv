0,SCO member states vow to boost rail connectivity,Pakistani delegation returns from New Delhi after attending three-day meeting that adopts work plan.,"LAHORE: A delegation of Pakistan Railways returned from India on Saturday after attending a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) railways committee during which member states agreed to increase rail connectivity and improve the existing infrastructure for the sustainable development of rail transport.
The meeting adopted the ‘Work Plan of the Meeting of the Heads of SCO  Railway Administrations for 2023-25’ along with a draft action plan for  the implementation of the ‘Concept of Interaction between SCO Railway  Administrations until 2025’ and the draft of ‘Initiative Council of the  SCO Heads of Government’ to promote quality and sustainable development  of international rail transport in the member states.
During the discussion, the SCO Secretariat was represented by Deputy Secretary-General Sohail  Khan who stressed the relevance of the initiatives from the SCO member  states in railway transport and noted the importance of coordinated work  in overcoming the consequences of the pandemic to restore stable  operations, as well as in the processes of updating and digitising the  industry.

A railways official, who was a part of the Pakistani delegation, told Dawn that the meeting was held in New Delhi from May 8 to 10 after a gap of two years. Railways Secretary Syed  Mazhar Shah headed the delegation. The trip was approved by the Foreign Office, Ministry of Railways  and PM’s Office.
During the first two days, experts  discussed matters related to strengthening and expanding the rail network,  the safety of passengers, construction of state-of-the-art freight  terminals and one-window operation for resolving such issue, the PR  official explained.
On the third day, secretaries of the member  states’ railway departments held consultations on the policy framework  determined in the preceding meeting of the experts.
Speaking to Dawn, the official who was part of the Pakistani delegation said all participants unanimously supported the proposals to improve  railway services, keep safety as the top priority, strengthen existing  railway lines, construct new tracks to connect SCO member states and  bring innovative interventions to improve the freight sector.
“I term the meeting successful, as it will help us improve our rail services,” he added.
The SCO secretariat also issued a statement after the meeting. It said the fourth meeting of the SCO Heads of Railway Administrations took place in New Delhi, led by India.
“During  the meeting, the heads of the delegations discussed the implementation  of the final resolutions of the third meeting [in Dushanbe] and the  development and improvement of multimodal transport and modern logistics  centres.”
The delegations “considered priority areas for the  construction of new railway lines connecting the SCO member states” and  measures taken by the SCO railway administrations during the Covid-19  pandemic.

1,BJP voted out in key Indian state,Congress cleanly regains Karnataka,"NEW DELHI: India’s Congress Party cleanly defeated the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the crucial state of Karnataka on Saturday, subverting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s hopes of expanding his muscular Hindu nationalism into the southern provinces.
The BJP had grabbed power in Karnataka in 2019 by inducing defections from the fragile Congress coalition government, and not winning it fairly. The Congress staged an emphatic victory this time, winning 136 seats in the 224 member state assembly, well beyond the halfway mark. 

Congress cleanly regains Karnataka

That Mr Modi held several rallies over a number of days, ending the campaign with a desperate religious appeal to Hindu voters magnified the importance of the BJP’s defeat. “The bazaar of hate has shut down. The shops of love are re-opened,” said Rahul Gandhi, whose recent marathon ‘March to unite India’ spent several days in the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka.
But the Congress’s troubles are not entirely over. It has to decide on the chief minister’s post between two contending stalwarts with different ideological thrusts. Ex-CM Siddaramaiah belongs to the social justice plank, while D.K. Shivakumar is a wealthy farmer with muscle power. Reports say both could be accommodated as chief ministers, splitting the five-year tenure into equal halves.
The problem of local satraps also dogged the BJP and it had to sideline an influential former chief minister to put the focus in the campaign on the prime minister. That Mr Modi’s overused charisma failed in Karnataka is said to be good news for the shunned B.S. Yeddiurappa, now even more vital for Mr Modi’s poll bid in May 2024.
The fact that the Karnataka results were decided by a marginal shift in votes should also worry India’s opposition parties. Two other results should make the opposition parties ponder their future, as Aam Aadmi Party won a single Lok Sabha seat from Jalandhar, defeating the Congress Party by a large margin and BJP led by an avowedly anti-Muslim CM has swept local body polls in Uttar Pradesh. The results are being seen as troublesome for former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, but the good news is that Lalu Yadav, recently freed on bail, has started working intensively for opposition unity. As the results from Karnataka trickled in, Lalu headed for a Muslim shrine known as ‘High Court Mazaar’, to offer prayers there. Adding to his joy was the Supreme Court’s verdict that proclaimed the recent change in government in Maharashtra to install a BJP rule by inducing defections as illegal.

2,Thousands flee as Mocha heads to Bangladesh,Rohingya refugees among vulnerable population; cyclone packing winds of up to 220km an hour.,"SITTWE: Thousands fled Myanmar’s west coast and officials in neighbouring Bangladesh raced to evacuate Rohingya refugees on Saturday as the most powerful cyclone in the region for over a decade churned across the Bay of Bengal.
Cyclone Mocha was packing winds of up to 220km an hour, according to India’s meteorological office, equivalent to a category four hurricane.
It is expected to weaken before making landfall on Sunday morning between Cox’s Bazaar, where nearly one million Rohingya refugees live in camps largely made up of flimsy shelters, and Sittwe on Myanmar’s western Rakhine coast.
On Saturday, Sittwe residents piled possessions and pets into cars, trucks and tuk-tuks and headed for higher ground. “We have our grandma in our family and we have to take care of her,” Khine Min told AFP from a truck packed with his relatives on a road out of the state capital.

Rohingya refugees among vulnerable population, as cyclone is packing winds of up to 220km an hour

“There is only one man left in Sittwe to take care of our homes.” Shops and markets in the town of about 150,000 people were shuttered, with many locals sheltering in monasteries.
Kyaw Tin, 40, said he could not leave the area as his son was in a local hospital. “I’m worried that this cyclone will affect our state just like Nargis did,” he added, referring to a 2008 storm that killed over 130,000 people in southern Myanmar.
While Myanmar’s junta authorities were supervising evacuations from villages along the Rakhine coast, Myanmar Airways International said all its flights to Rakhine state had been suspended until Monday.
In neighbouring Bangladesh officials moved to evacuate Rohingya refugees from ‘risky areas’ to community centres.
“Cyclone Mocha is the most powerful storm since Cyclone Sidr,” Azizur Rahman, the head of Bangladesh’s Met Office, told AFP. That cyclone hit Bangladesh’s southern coast in November 2007, killing more than 3,000 people.
Bangladeshi authorities have banned the Rohingya from constructing permanent concrete homes, fearing it may incentivise them to settle permanently.
“We live in houses made of tarpaulin and bamboo,” said refugee Enam Ahmed, who resides at the Nayapara camp near the border town of Teknaf. “We are scared. We don’t know where we will be sheltered. We are in a panic.” 
Forecasters expect the cyclone to bring a deluge of rain, which can trigger landslides. 
Mocha is also predicted to unleash a storm surge up to 13 feet high, which could inundate low-lying  villages.

3,Turkiye set to vote in tight  presidential race,Erdogan leads prayers at Hagia Sophia as six-party opposition alliance joins forces to unseat him.,"ISTANBUL: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan led Saturday prayers at Istanbul’s iconic Hagia Sophia mosque, ahead of a battle for his political life against a secular rival as he braces for Sunday’s parliamentary and presidential ballot.
Erdogan has never faced a more energised or united opposition than the one led by retired civil servant Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his disparate alliance of six parties. The Turkish leader excelled at splitting his rivals and forging unlikely unions while winning one national election after another over 21 years.
Amid Turkiye’s economic challenges, the six opposition parties have put aside their political and cultural differences and joined forces for the lone task of pushing Erdogan out. They are officially supported by Turkiye’s main pro-Kurdish party — a group that accounts for around 10 per cent of the vote.

Erdogan leads prayers at Hagia Sophia, as six-party opposition alliance joins forces to unseat him

Kilicdaroglu is now desperately trying to break the 50pc threshold and avoid a May 28 runoff that could give Erdogan a chance to regroup and reframe the debate. “Are you ready to bring democracy to this country? To bring peace to this country? I promise, I am ready too,” Kilicdaroglu told a rally in Ankara.
On the other hand, Erdogan was put in the uncomfortable position of being asked on TV what he would do if he lost. The veteran leader bristled and pledged to respect the vote. “We came to power in Turkiye by democratic means, with the approval of our people. If our people were to change their mind, we would do what democracy requires.” 
His campaign path to re-election has taken him to the iconic Hagia Sophia, which he decided to convert back into a mosque nearly a century after Mustafa Kemal Ataturk had turned it into a museum during his secular post-Ottoman rule. His decision to convert it back into a mosque in 2020 solidified his hero status among his religious supporters and contributed to growing Western unease with his rule. 
“The entire West got mad — but I did it,” Erdogan told an Istanbul rally on Saturday. He has played up religious themes and used culture wars to try and energise his conservative and nationalist base.
However, the voting will also include southeastern regions that lie in ruins in the wake of a February quake that claimed more than 50,000 lives. The level of anger in these traditionally pro-Erdogan regions could also help swing Sunday’s outcome.

4,‘EU should talk Imran out of confrontation with govt’,New report suggests bloc talk to both sides; warns Pakistan needs much more than IMF loan to revive economy.,"ISLAMABAD: The European Union and its member states can apprise PTI Chairman Imran Khan about the risks of confrontation with the government in a bid to lessen the political polarisation in Pakistan, a new report has suggested.
The report by the International Crisis Group (ICG) — an independent organisation working for global peace — said Pakistan is currently facing three crises: political confrontation, a fragile economy and resurging militancy.
The ICG, in its ‘Watch List 2023’ — which identifies where the EU and its member states can intervene to enhance prospects for peace — stated Mr Khan has reached out to EU member states “in hopes of fixing the harm done by his anti-Western conspiracy narratives”.
“These governments can, at the very least, hold conversations with him about the risks associated with his confrontation with the Sharif government,” the report added.

New report suggests bloc talk to both sides; warns Pakistan needs much more than IMF loan to revive economy

For dealing with the other side, i.e. the government, the EU should emphasise that in order to gain benefits of the ‘GSP Plus’ scheme, the country should adhere to democratic norms, including respect for free speech and the freedom of association.
Mr Khan’s arrest has undermined the chances of compromise as the ex-premier was unlikely to accept the government’s preference for general elections in October.
Economic revival
According to the watch list, political polarisation has heightened at a time when there was a risk of default if Islamabad failed to reach an agreement with the IMF.
However, a deal with the IMF alone cannot avert this crisis as the economy needed a capital injection of “nearly 50 per cent larger than what the IMF would provide”.
 
 

But, lenders are unlikely to disburse the money amid political turmoil and investment risk would be too high.
Although the current government restarted the negotiations, “election-year calculations” appeared to have limited their options for economic revival.
The country has urged global powers, including the EU member states, to exercise their influence with the IMF to fast-track the bailout.
The ICG suggested EU member states help Islamabad in exchange for economic reforms to put Pakistan on a path to sustainable recovery.
The government should be stopped from taking populist measures for votes, the ICG suggested while cautioning that there should be a realistic understanding of how far Islamabad can be pushed to implement reforms.
‘Press Kabul to address Pakistan’s concerns’
The report suggested EU governments address Pakistan’s concerns over militancy, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“In both quiet and public diplomacy, they should hold the Afghan Taliban to their pledge to prevent militants from attacking other countries, which they made in the 2020 peace agreement they signed in Qatar.”
Kabul should also be provided with support to maintain peace, such as technical assistance with border management.
Help in flood recovery
The EU and other countries, which pledged around $10 billion to assist Pakistan’s flood recovery efforts, should focus on helping the country build a resilient infrastructure.
The EU should also work with provincial governments to repair damaged health and education facilities and such assistance could be channelled through authorities or UN agencies such as WFP and WHO.
