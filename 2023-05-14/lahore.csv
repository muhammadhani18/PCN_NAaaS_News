According to Rescue 1122 officials, the labourers, identified as Irfan Lateef, 22, Chand Ashraf, 25, Arshad Nazir, 28, and Amanat, 30, were assigned the job of cleaning a well where scum left during soap manufacturing was dumped in a private soap factory located near Basti Larr on Bahawalpur Road, Multan.
The officials said initially one of the workers went down the well to clean it, but did not return after considerable time as he fell unconscious and died after inhaling the fumes of the chemicals in the waste.
He said later three other labourers went down the well to rescue their colleague, but met the same fate due to the toxic gasses accumulating inside the well.
Sources said the workers were provided no safety gear by the factory management to handle the highly toxic waste material.   
A Rescue 1122 team called to the scene retrieved the bodies of the four labourers from the well and shifted these to the Nishtar Hospital.
Multan police have started investigation into the incident.

3,Buzdar’s bail extended  in illegal assets case,Told to join investigation without fail.,"LAHORE: An accountability court on Saturday extended the interim pre-arrest bail of former chief minister Usman Buzdar in an inquiry of illegal assets by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) with a warning to him to join the investigation without fail.
Buzdar did not appear before the court as his counsel sought a one-time exemption from appearance saying his client was in Dera Ghazi Khan to attend his ailing mother and could not make it to Lahore due to the blockade of roads in the province.
Judge Sajjad Ahmad Sheikh allowed the application of Buzdar and asked the investigating officer of the NAB about the progress in the investigation.
The officer told the judge that Buzdar neither joined the investigation nor submitted the details of his assets.

Told to join investigation without fail

Buzdar’s counsel requested for more time to furnish the details to the NAB.
The judge observed that the petitioner was neither cooperating in the investigation nor appearing before the court regularly. He warned the petitioner’s counsel of serious consequences if his client continued the practice.
The judge extended the bail of Buzdar till May 18 giving last opportunity to him to join the investigation.
Initially, Buzdar secured pre-arrest bail on Nov 19, 2022, which he withdrew on Dec 13 as the investigating officer of the NAB said warrants for the arrest had not been issued.
Later, Buzdar again approached the court on Feb 16, 2023 and obtained the bail fearing his arrest in the inquiry.
In his bail petition, Buzdar submitted that the NAB with mala fide intention and in connivance with the incumbent federal government had been politically victimising him. He said all the allegations against him were baseless.

Justice Safdar Saleem Shahid took up a habeas corpus petition seeking recovery of Sahi, also a son-in-law of LHC Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti.
A lawyer told the court that police arrested Sahi from the committee room of the district bar association, Faisalabad, along with a former president of the bar.  
He said the whereabouts of Sahi were unknown to his family.
Asked about the absence of the inspector general of police (IGP), an additional advocate general told the court that the IGP was busy with official duty since the prime minister was in the city.
The law officer also denied the arrest of the PTI’s former MPA by the police.
The Faisalabad city police officer stated that a special team had been constituted for his recovery. He said the police should be given some time to recover Sahi.  
Justice Shahid observed that the matter involved fundamental rights of a citizen and the court will not allow any unlawful act.
The judge ordered the Faisalabad police to ensure production of the former minister on Monday.
Later in the evening, Sahi suddenly reached his Chak Jhumra residence in Faisalabad.
His friend Advocate Mian Saad Javed told Dawn that when the family of Sahi moved the high court, some unknown persons driving a car dropped the former minister near Lallian, Chiniot.
He said Sahi called his family and he was brought home.  
Sahi did not respond to several calls made on his mobile number by Dawn.
Meanwhile, a delegation of lawyers led by DBA president Rana Shahid Munir Manj visited former president Bilal Ashraf Basra at central jail.

6,"Talk on novels about Sonia Gandhi, Kapurthala raja",Spanish author plans to write a novel on Benazir Bhutto also,"LAHORE: A fascinating conversation with celebrated Spanish author Javier Moro was held at Alhamra Art Centre, The Mall, on Saturday.  
It was organised by the Lahore Arts Council, in collaboration with the Embassy of Spain. Spanish Ambassador Jose Antonio de Ory also graced the occasion.  
LAC Board of Governors member Razi Ahmed, also the founder of the Lahore Literary Festival, introduced Javier Moro as an internationally acclaimed author. Moro travelled to India in the late 1960s when he was 14-year-old and he was charmed by the country as well as the region, Razi said. 
“Moro has extensively written on the region (subcontinent) in a style called dramatised history, recreating the life of historical characters.”  

Spanish author plans to write a novel on Benazir Bhutto also

Razi Ahmed termed Moro a writer and a journalist of great calibre with the bestselling novels to his credit. 
In conversation with Moro, the honorary consul general of Spain in Lahore, Jalal Sallahuddin, asked many interesting questions, including those about the thought process, his inspiration to recreate historical characters, difference in fiction and history, especially in reference to his two bestselling novels, Passion India and The Red Sari. 
Mr Moro said he had a close association with the subcontinent.  
Discussing Passion India, which brought international recognition for Moro after its publication in 2005, the novelist said the book was a story of love and betrayal between Spanish singer Anita Delgado and Maharaja of Kapurthala Jagatjit Singh set in 1906. The novel registered sale of 1.3m copies, followed by translation in 20 languages.  
Mr Moro described the novel as an insight into the culture and life of the Rajas who were wealthy puppets of the British. The novel also described palace life, regional politics and the British Raj. Maharaja had been portrayed as a person who maintained a balance among different communities and who was a caring and large hearted ruler.  
Moro threw light on his novel The Red Sari published in 2008, a fictionalised story of the prominent Indian political family, the Nehru -Gandhi through the eyes of Italian-born Sonia Maino ( Sonia Gandhi) who became president of the Indian National Congress in 1998. The writer shared with the audience the reaction he faced after the publication of the novel in India and that it was about to be banned. The novel turned out to be a bestseller in Europe. The novel was considered a controversial book in India; however a mini-series based on it was in the offing. Moro said that he also intended to write a novel on Benazir Bhutto but it was still to be done.  
The writer also discussed his novel, You Are The Empire, published in 2011 a book about Brazil’s first emperor and the making of the Brazilian nation. The writer also showed on screen interesting and of great historical significance photographs of Punjab before the Partition.

He was online addressing the concluding ceremony of three-day international conference on ‘Central and South Asia Re-connected’ organised by Punjab University Department of History and Pakistan Studies in collaboration with Konrad Adenauer Stiftung.  
PU VC Prof Dr Khalid Mahmood, Regional Director Southeast Asia Konrad Adenauer Stiftung Dr Ellino Zeino, Chairman Department of History Prof Dr Mahboob Hussain, researchers and a large number of students were present.
Mr Syed said Pakistan could play a positive role to bring connectivity due to its strategic location. He said the people could be able to understand the problems of regional connectivity through this conference.  
The scholars unanimously recommended in the conference that the region of South Asia has lagged behind in human and social development due to political, cultural and social conflicts, both in the nature of inter- and intra-state, which have hampered and created hurdles in the way of prosperity and progress of the region in the past many years.
The conference endorses its resolve that peace and harmony, instead of war and confrontation, would provide windows of opportunity for developing the human potential of South Asian people and for asserting themselves as civilised people of the world.
Dr Zeino thanked the national and international delegates of Turkiye, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, England, Germany and Pakistan.  
Dr Mahboob Hussain said 13 sessions were held in which around 60 subject specific research papers policy notes were presented.

8,harking back: How Lahore grew to the south of the walled city,"As the ancient walled city, as well as the old city, of Lahore expanded, it was influenced by developments outside....","As the ancient walled city, as well as the old city, of Lahore expanded, it was influenced by developments outside. The city started growing outwards almost 400 years ago, and it makes sense to understand this phenomenon.
In this piece let us concentrate on what was happening to the south. Later, in other pieces, we will explore the east, west and north. This will help us understand the present Lahore better.  
The ancient city originally had two gates to the south, or better still just one ancient gateway and a ‘mori’- hole. Later when Akbar expanded the city he added Bhati Gate, Shahalami Gate and Mochi Gate to the expanded southern side of Lahore.
Lohari Gate had a huge green garden opposite it, and it was used by Qutub-uddin Aibak and others to play polo. In his days he was known as Qutb Ghauri, and when he fell from his horse and was killed, he was buried at the edge of this garden. The road opposite the gateway headed straight to the east, curving slightly to the west and heading on towards Multan, an equally ancient, if not more so, city.
With time as the city shopkeepers opened shops this created the very first ‘mohallah’ outside Lahore, and was popularly called “Lakkhi Mohallah”, the precinct of the rich or millionaires. It soon became an important bazaar with huge shops. The name Anarkali Bazaar is a British-era renaming of the place based on the myth of a courtesan named Anarkali, whom Emperor Akbar allegedly threw out of his court for having an affair with his son Prince Saleem, who later became Emperor Jahangir. We know that episode because of an Imtiaz Ali Taj drama.
This pre-Mughal ‘mohallah’ was to grow with time and when the British came they set up their first military cantonment along this road. Much later they built ‘The Mall Road’ starting from the French-built Civil Secretariat at Lower Mall to the shrine of Mian Mir, and then expanded the cantonment to the west, as it stands today.
The second ‘gateway’ of ancient Lahore is Mori Darwaza. As the River Ravi flowed around the old city, this narrow gateway was used by Hindus to cremate their dead. Almost a thousand years ago the great Lahore Hindushahi ruler Raja Jayapala was cremated outside the gateway. Jayapala cremated himself out of a Rajput sense of honour – Johar - for losing to the Afghan-Turkic invader Mahmud of Ghazni.
Come Emperor Akbar and with an expanded old walled city, we have three additional gateways facing the south, they being Bhati Gate to the western edge, Shahalam Gate in the middle and Mochi Gate at the eastern end of the southern side of the expanded wall.
Opposite the Shahalam Gate was the ‘tila Bukhari Mohallah’ where existed the ‘chaubara’ of Chajju Bhagat. This is located on Hospital Road and existed before the Mayo Hospital was built. A Lahore entrepreneur has at that place started a school to keep it in order. The road has an ancient connection to the court of Akbar as Mian Taan Sain and other renowned classical musicians stayed and worked there. Today a small tannery has spoiled the history of this place, where bamboos are sold.
Up Hospital Road is also the shrine of Hazrat Yaqoob Zanjani, whose brother a great Sufi saint Syed Miran Hussain Zanjani, who died in 1047 AD, is buried at Chah Miran. Legend has it that when Ali Hasan alias Data Ganj Bakhsh of Hajwir, came to Lahore with Masud Ghazni, son of Mahmud, the funeral of Syed Zanjani was emerging from Lohari Gate. Hence Zanjani brothers were always held in high esteem by all Sufi saints who came to Lahore.
One major development on the road out of Shahalam gateway was the Gowalmandi area. This emerged after the Sikhs conquered Kashmir and hundreds of Kashmiri families fled to Lahore and Gujranwala. In Lahore they set up a cattle market, hence the name ‘gowal-mandi’. But then after considerable family infighting and gang warfare, most people set up food shops. Today it stands out for its food quality.
Now on to the south-eastern gateway called Mochi gate, which heads towards Qila Gujjar Singh where in early days the ‘serai’ of Gujjar Mal Khatri stood. Before the times of Maharajah Ranjit Singh this area was ruled over by the Bhangi warrior Gujjar Singh of the Sikh Triumvirate, whose father was a Sandhu Jat, who built a fort known as Qila Gujjar Singh. The original historic fort’s wooden gates now lie with a resident of the area.
The extended road from Mochi Gate heads south towards what was once known as Mohallah Pir Mozang. This area was originally the ‘jagir’ of Jamadar Khushal Singh who was granted this ancient area by Ranjit Singh. In the Icchara area, an equally ancient small village, beyond Mozang, some ancient temples still exist, which need conservation assistance. Today the area is a major Lahore marketplace.
Around this Mozang area have grown Tajpura, Mehr Madhu, Basti Methran, and other newer areas. It also houses Lahore’s oldest graveyard, where Guru Nanak used to stay while his disciple visited Lahore. The roads to the south all lead to smaller towns like Kasur.
But then the southern areas of Lahore started growing with the coming of the British. That process has not stopped with places like Samanabad being a major development. The British built educational institutions to the south of the walled city, as well as major markets and modern residential areas.
The entire southern area of Lahore is what basically modern Lahore constitutes. Though it stretches in every direction becoming a city with a colossal 12 million-plus people, it still retains its ancient flavours of learning, of quality food, and with artisans with a Lahori-touch.

10,Polio vaccination from tomorrow,Programme head stresses enough security for vaccinators,"LAHORE: Punjab Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) coordinator and polio programme head Khizer Afzaal Chaudhry has called on the district administrations to ensure provision of adequate security to the workers’ teams during the polio eradication campaign starting from Monday (tomorrow). 
He was addressing a meeting held to review the status of preparedness of the upcoming polio eradication campaign.  
The district health management teams of 12 districts, including the chief executive officers, district health officers and partner staff, participated in the meeting via a video link. 
Mr Chaudhry stressed wrapping up the orientation of polio teams on time. “The district health administrations shall wrap up team training on time to ensure quality,” he said. 
Speaking about the risk of virus importation from endemic zones, he directed the districts to make adequate arrangements of vaccination of children at the transit points. He said all transitory and mobile populations who had entered Punjab to earn their livelihoods were be integrated into micro-plans.  

Programme head stresses enough security for vaccinators

“Although Punjab is free of polio virus yet it is at the risk of imported virus recirculation. Therefore, the districts need to map and vaccinate every child belonging to the high-risk mobile populations.”  
The EOC coordinator urged the Rajanpur deputy commissioner to ensure provision of security to the polio teams.  
“On the security situation in riverine areas of Rojhan in the wake of police action against dacoits, the district health management teams need to seek guidance from the deputy commissioner and submit a report to the EOC before the campaign,” Mr Chaudhry observed. 
The EOC head stressed that not a single child could be deprived of the polio vaccine as this could give way to the virus to spread. 
Twelve districts of Punjab have been made a part of the campaign, including Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Bhakkar, DG Khan, Layyah, Mianwali, Multan, Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Sheikhupura. 
In Lahore, Rawalpindi and Faisalabad, the campaign will continue for seven days while in other districts, it will last five days. Over 84,000 polio workers will participate in the drive to immunise 10.8m children under the age of five against polio.
Punjab has been free of polio cases since October 2020, which is an achievement of the programme. However, Punjab’s last environmental samples that tested positive in January were linked with Afghanistan and south Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Punjab is aware that being the country’s biggest province in terms of resources and population, it is at the risk of imported virus recirculation. Therefore, it is taking concrete steps to improve the quality of campaigns and coverage of high-risk mobile populations at transit points.

11,Athar Tahir – his journey from writing poetry to novel,Poet and short story writer Athar Tahir has come up with a novel as he expands his literary oeuvre in English...,"


 
Poet and short story writer Athar Tahir has come up with a novel as he expands his literary oeuvre in English literature. His novel Second Coming, published by the Lighthouse Publishers, centres around a man who falls for a far younger woman at the later stage of his life. It’s more than just a romance as the protagonist attempts to take cognisance of emotional and mental complexities of both the people involved in the story. That Tahir took on the genre of novel after his accomplishments as a poet and publication of a short stories collection about 32 years back was a surprise to many.  
To his question of the evolution of his debut novel, he talked about evaluating experience of life, both at the moment of experience as well in retrospect.   
“This (Second Coming) is really quite a late-age work but that’s itself the subject of the novel–aging. That’s the whole idea that you experience the process of aging and how does this aging happens. It tries to explore the sensitivities and sensibilities of an aging protagonist and how he thinks about his past and what’s happening to him now and what the future holds for him.”  
Tahir says that his novel works at three different levels as the narrative continues with flashbacks and those flashbacks are integrated into the current experience of the protagonist.  
He says that it started soon after the last visit to Thailand in 2016. He completed it in 2017 but did not publish it because he kept reviewing the manuscript. “The last sections I edited out. It was a much larger novel but I felt that perhaps that portion was distracting from what I intended to do. I deleted tens of pages so that it becomes a more cohesive work of literature.”   
About the craft of novel writing, Tahir found it challenging in the sense that it was a different way of thinking than he had to employ for writing his poems.   
“In poetry, there is a great deal of sensitivity towards images and metaphors that you use to manipulate the structure. There is a great deal of craft. In the novel, you have a larger canvas. You are at greater liberty to play around the experience and the thinking that has gone into the novel. In this novel, I adhere to the Aristotelian technique – the beginning, the middle and the end. I was aware that I was conforming to the classical form of the novel. But at the same time, I was trying to make the readers see the whole narrative through the eyes of the protagonist and that in itself creates a certain amount of requirement from the reader’s side.”   
Athar Tahir says that in Second Coming there is just one person commenting on everything and the reader has to engage with him to discover the reality and what the protagonist is making up in his mind. There are questions left unanswered and the reader has to see what’s true and what is mere imagination, Tahir asserts.  
To the question of autobiographical elements in his novel in which the protagonist shares certain facts about with Tahir himself, the poet-turned-novelist says no author can write a novel without something of himself in it whether it’s fantasy, stream of consciousness or science fiction. “If you say that the protagonist is based on the writer, that’s an assumption. The name of the protagonist was purposefully left out because if the name had been given, it would have been a certain person. Without a name, it could be anybody or everyman. That was the whole idea. Much of it was left to the imagination of the readers. If they think it’s autobiographical. That’s fine. But that’s not necessary. But they should concentrate on the evolution of the character.”   
About the importance of fiction to be embedded in real life, whether on one’s own experiences or of others, Tahir thinks that for any character to be relevant it must speak of some aspect of the reader’s personality. “If the reader finds something factual or something he can relate to, that’s the triumph of the novelist. It proves that the writer has created a persona of truth in fiction. Fiction is based on facts but just those interpreted by the author.”   
Tahir reveals that Second Coming is a part of a quartet. “There are four novels that are interlinked. I have written the first novel which I wrote before this Second Coming—the fourth novel in the quartet. I am holding the first novel for publishing later this year or early next year. There are two other novels that come between the first and the fourth. I published the fourth novel of the quartet first in order to create curiosity and generate the interest of the readers. The readers would find the answers to the questions about autobiographical [element] when they read the other three novels.”  
He says he is writing the second and the third novel of the quartet now. “The first novel that’s ready for publishing is called, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, from Shakespeare’s Macbeth. The first novel is going to be as if it has no beginning, middle and end because in it I am challenging the notion of narration. I am playing with the form. Each novel of the quartet will stand on its own feet. But it’s not something like the Alexandria Quartet of Lawrence Durrell.”   
When asked about his journey from poetry to novel and the reason for writing it, he says the novel is a more exploratory medium in the sense that you can go into all sorts of directions which poetry, with its emphasis on brevity, exactitude and pertinence is something that novel may or may not accept.   
“The novel is a freer genre and you can do anything with it whereas poetry has its own limitations and requirements which you have to conform to.”   
He explains that he wanted to write a novel, which should explore more complicated but intertwined themes–the things and issues that prompted him to think about them. “So that was the reason for writing the novel thinking it would be more accessible. Poetry is the last thing people read because it requires a great deal of application of mind due to its inherent form. In the novel you can get away with a lot.”  
Tahir goes on to say that novels are more read than short stories, plays and poetry. “It is very accessible and it’s something where everybody finds something to enjoy,” he argues.

The suspect, Ansar, of Jataria village had been a nominated suspect in the murder case registered by Lalamusa Sadar police on February 6, 1992. The police said that the suspect had been at large since the incident and later fled the country. 
Station House Officer Adnan Shahzad had been tasked with tracing and arresting the suspect through Interpol after which police launched the process to get the suspect repatriated from Dubai. 
A spokesman for Gujrat police said the police got the red warrants of the suspect issued by Interpol after which he was repatriated by Dubai authorities back to Pakistan and now further legal proceedings were being initiated against him.        
WOMAN KILLED: Yet another married woman was killed allegedly by her in-laws over a domestic dispute at Shadiwal village in Kunjah police precincts. 
Police said Shazia Kausar of Hanj village near Kharian had been married to Umair Warraich of Shadiwal around a year ago. However, she developed differences with her in-laws, who would often quarrel with her, the police added.  
On Saturday, the police said, Shazia was allegedly subjected to torture by some of the female members of her husband’s family and later a brother of her husband shot her, leaving the woman critically injured. 
The injured woman died while being shifted to the Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital. The body was later handed over to the family of the deceased woman after an autopsy. 
A team comprising officials of police and the Punjab Forensic Science Agency visited the crime scene and collected evidence. 
Police have registered a case against five nominated suspects, including a man and four women under sections 302, 148 and 149 of the PPC on the report of Muhammad Arshad, a brother of the victim. 
At least 12 women have so far been murdered in Gujrat district in around four and a half months of the current year, while three of them were killed in two incidents in a single day earlier this week. Convictions are rare in women’s murder cases in Pakistan.

14,Concerns at tariff hike without power theft control,"Why should Fesco consumers pay for others sin, asks FCCI","TOBA TEK SINGH: Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Dr Khurram Tariq has expressed concerns at the increase in rates of electricity without controlling its pilferage.  
In a statement on Saturday, he said the distribution companies (Discos) were not only mandated to distribute electricity within their jurisdictions but they were bound to check line losses, pilferage and 100pc recoveries of bills. 
He said it was the incompetence of the Discos to transfer the financial burden of power theft by a few miscreants to the responsible consumers who regularly paid their bills. 
He said there was no justification to continue this practice as the Discos had dedicated staff to check power theft in addition to enjoying the full support of the government and law enforcement agencies. 
He said despite all facilities, if Discos had failed to discharge their obligations, the onus of their failure should be on the officials concerned and it should not be transferred to the law-abiding consumers.  

Why should Fesco consumers pay for others sin, asks FCCI 

Dr Tariq said the provincial governments should take responsibility to check the power theft and proposed that the amount of theft could be deducted from the share of the particular province in the national pool otherwise the vicious circle of power theft could not be checked and rise in electricity tariff would continue without any justification.  
He said recovery of stolen electricity in the area of one Disco could not be recovered from the consumer of the other Discos. 
He said the performance of the Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco) was excellent and its recoveries were 99.9pc but its consumers were paying billions of rupees for the theft of electricity made in the areas of other Discos. 
He termed this recovery a sheer injustice to the responsible consumers. He said if this trend was controlled, we could reasonably cut down the electricity bills of the consumers of Fesco.

15,MJAH proposes riyal-enabled ATM cards for Haj,TOBA TEK SINGH: Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith (MJAH) central leader Maulana  Muhammad Yousaf Anwar has proposed to the...,"TOBA TEK SINGH: Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith (MJAH) central leader Maulana  Muhammad Yousaf Anwar has proposed to the federal finance ministry and  the State Bank to introduce riyal-rupee based ATM cards for the Muslims  intending to perform Haj and Umrah.  
In a statement on Saturday at  Faisalabad, he said every year approximately 1.4 million Pakistanis  visit Saudia Arabia to perform Haj and Umrah. He said in order to facilitate  them and encourage them to prefer ATM cards instead of carrying currency to meet their financial needs in Saudi Arabia, the government  should issue ATM cards.  
The MJAH leader said last year 81,132 and  1,267,490 Pakistanis performed Haj and Umrah, respectively. He said in addition  to these travellers, 2.4m Pakistani are also rendering  services there. 
He said people with temporary visa carry riyal  and the chances of their theft or going missing could not be omitted. He  said Pakistanis spend billions of rupees every year and they could be facilitated with a riyal-enabled ATM card  to meet their financial needs during their stay in Saudi Arabia.  
He said  the step could help the government regulate, monitor and  document the amount spent on the ritual. He stressed that  the facility should be in accordance with Islamic principles and  should not involve Riba in any case.  
He further said the Islamic banks  might be requested to undertake the project to facilitate the Haj and Umrah pilgrims. He said an initial study might also be conducted to  identify its possible pros and cons before a formal launch.  
He also  proposed to restart a ferry service from Karachi to Jeddah so that  Pakistanis with limited financial resources could also perform the religious obligation.
