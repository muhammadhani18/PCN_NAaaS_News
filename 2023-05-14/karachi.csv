0,‘Poisoned hearts’ got no room for mothers,Lonely mothers at shelter home remember their families on Mother’s Day,"KARACHI: It was a warm and windy day at the Bilquis Edhi Welfare Shelter Home for Mentally Disturbed Women in North Nazimabad. The little almond trees planted by Faisal Edhi swayed in the wind. “Soon these almond trees will grow big and strong offering cool umbrella-like shades to sit under. Then these winds, too, will turn into a breeze,” said Waseem Baji, one of the senior staff members, at the shelter home. 
She also spoke about the other trees on their grounds. “We also have neem and eucalyptus, jujube, tamarind, chiku [sapodilla] and jamun [java plum] trees here. Faisal [Edhi] just loves big shady trees,” she said. 
This Bilquis Edhi Welfare Shelter Home has some 1,300 women. Most of them are elderly mothers. The talk about shady trees earlier also makes one think about mothers. It won’t be wrong to compare mothers to fruitful trees with shade. But sometimes these fruitful trees can also be attacked by termites. In the case of mothers at the Bilquis Edhi Welfare Shelter Home, their own families turned out to be the termites ailing the trees. 
Shagufta Kamal has been living at the Shelter Home for 10 to 15 years. She is about 42 years old now and was first brought here by her father. “I was told that I had lost my mind after my mother passed away and my father had no other option,” she said.

Later, when she was better, her older sister found a nice match for her and married her off. She stayed with her husband for some years, but then he also brought her back when she started fighting with her mother-in-law. 
She also has a child but he is still young to have a say in these matters. “So I am here and my family is there,” she said. 
Naureen Khan, another woman at the Shelter Home, said that she didn’t fight like Shagufta. “I wish I could fight. Then I would not have accepted my fate the way I have,” she said. 
Naureen was sent here 10 years ago by her three sisters-in-law, her brothers’ wives, who didn’t want to keep her. “I got divorced when my daughter was three and my son was only one years old. My ex-husband took my children from me and sent me to my brothers. I never approached the court for my children’s custody because if I had got them where would I have taken them? There was not even room for me at my brothers’ house,” she said. 
Naheed Bano has four grown-up children — two sons and two daughters. 
“When I was living at home, not a day would pass by when my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law would leave me alone. They would constantly be picking on me. When I would react they would tell my husband that I needed psychological care. Then he left me here never to come back,” she said. 
“My daughters come to see me sometimes with little gifts. When I ask them to take me back home, they say they would when they have a bigger house because they cannot accommodate me in their small house,” Naheed said. 
“Maybe, there really is no longer any room for me in their house and hearts but there is a lot of room for me here at this Shelter Home,” she said. “I pray for Bilquis Endhi, Maulana Edhi and their family. Faisal and Sabah Edhi are our real family, who take such good care of us here. They tend to all our needs and also make sure that we get our medicines on time here,” she said. 
Shazia Fayyaz is back at the Edhi Shelter Home for the third time now. She has not seen her family in the 13 years that she has been here since the last time she returned. 
“My daughter is married and in Hyderabad but my son is here. My husband had divorced me, saying that I am crazy. He has also poisoned my son’s mind as he doesn’t take my phone calls,” she said. 
Another woman also named Shazia with Ghafoor as her second name said that she also had been in and out of the Edhi Home. “My husband is my cousin, my maternal mother’s son. He divorced me on his mother’s orders but then when the children started giving him trouble, he decided to get married to me again. But for that I had to marry another man and get divorced from him in order to get married to my first husband again,” she said, adding that she did that but got in the family way from the second husband. 
“I have a six-year-old son from him. He took away my youngest child after I gave birth. We were already divorced. And my aunt got her son, my first husband to someone else while I was sent here over some domestic quarrel. Now she has gotten her son married to someone else from outside the family and the new wife doesn’t want me there,” she said. 
Zaibunissa has been living at the shelter home for eight years now and has one daughter back home whom she misses dearly. 
“It’s been one year since I saw my daughter. My daughter is 16 now. We often speak over the phone and she tells me that her father and stepmother don’t allow her to meet me,” she said. 
Shakila Parween has also spent eight years at the shelter home. She is the oldest of the seven mothers and says she has four grown-up children out of whom two are married also. “But none of them seem to have a place for their aged mother. I thank God every day for having this shelter home roof over my head at least,” she said. 
Dr Naseem Aqeel — who has been taking care of the mothers for some 20 years now — said that she was allowed four days off a week but she came to the shelter home every day. “I come here every day because they miss me if I take it off even for a single day,” she said. 
She said that 99 per cent of the mothers were mentally disturbed. “But they get better until you can’t even tell that there is anything wrong with them. Then sometimes when their families take them back home they are not very strict about taking their medicines regularly, which results in another outburst bringing them back to the Home,” she said. 
“Here they have so many other mothers going through the same kind of issues as them. All miss their children. They all talk about how they feel with each other, which is also like a therapy. Similar company creates a bond among them. It also takes some of their loneliness away,” the doctor concluded.

The courts of judicial magistrates (west) granted them bail against a surety bond of Rs5,000 each.
Police also produced nine activists before a judicial magistrate (Malir) for remand in a case pertaining to blocking a road in Sohrab Goth and damaging property.

2,‘Robber’ who killed citizen in Baldia shot dead in ‘encounter’,"KARACHI: Police claimed to have killed a suspected robber after he, along with his accomplice, shot dead a citizen ...","KARACHI: Police claimed to have killed a suspected robber after he, along with his accomplice, shot dead a citizen in Baldia Town in the small hours of Saturday morning.
The Madina Colony police identified the citizen as Nasir Khattak, 35, who they said was killed while resisting a robbery bid near Police Training Centre Saeedabad late on Friday night.
Keamari-SSP Fida Husain Janwari said that after killing the victim three robbers were fleeing when a police patrol heard gunshots and reached the spot.

4,‘Karachi has a significant intangible culture’,"American archaeologist says in Mehrgarh people were buried with jewellery, a lot of which came from the coast near Karachi","KARACHI: The coastline of Karachi doesn’t just have a tangible culture as it also has a significant intangible culture, said distinguished architect and town planner Arif Hasan on Saturday.
He was addressing as chief guest at the 8th Annual International Conference on ‘Endangered heritage of south Sindh with special reference to Karachi’ organised by Dr N. A. Baloch Institute of Heritage Research at the Arts Council here.
Mr Hasan said there are many stories associated with Karachi. “I have seen a number of sites that have vanished. There was a site where today exists a part of Gulistan-i-Jauhar. It was an important site. I know a bit in detail about it. Then there was one at Bath Island. That too has disappeared and these days there’s an officers’ housing on that location. Apart from that, there are four to five sites in the range (zad pe) of the under construction Malir Highway.” 
The architect said old Karachi neighbourhoods should be looked at as well. “The wall around the old city was demolished by the British in 1848. One part of Rampart Road is on a raised ground. I think since it is high, there must be traces of that wall underneath it.”

American archaeologist says in Mehrgarh people were buried with jewellery, a lot of which came from the coast near Karachi

“Similarly, there are other places to do with intangible culture. One of them is Mahadev Temple. The story about it is that when Shivji gave a form to the world, he got tired and rested in a cave. After resting he promised to look after the area. In 1983, I interview a number of Sindhi scholars and members of the Hindu community, I intend to publish them. The Hindu community claims that the temple is mentioned in the Mahabharata. I read the Mahabharata because of this mandir, but I could not find any reference to it in book. Except at one place it’s given that there’s a cave near the sea where Shiv stayed,” he said.
“Mewa Shah is another subject and how he arrived in Karachi. [It’s said] he faced a few property-related problems in the place, which I’m forgetting, from where he came. The issues angered him and he landed in Karachi.” 
Mr Hasan in the last part of his extempore speech touched upon a Jewish graveyard. “Mostly, the names and dates on gravestones are in Hebrew. As far as I recall, the first grave dates back to 1841. It’s a beautiful cemetery. When I published its pictures and details on my website, I received many letters from Jews who’re settled in the UK and whose elders were from Karachi. I got to talk to some seniors, too, and they told me many things about Karachi, expressing their affection for the city. Most of them left Karachi in 1967.” 
Earlier, American archaeologist Jonathan Mark Kenoyer gave an enlightening presentation on ‘Coastal Communities of the Indus: Regional Contributions to the Indus Tradition’. 
He said in 7000BC, one of the earliest periods when people were settling down, materials from the coast of Makran — even from Oman — from Karachi near Hawkesbay, from Somiani, from the Indus delta, from Gujarat… things were traded to people from inland areas of the region. “Archaeologists first thought that they went to Mehrgarh, but now [after excavations] we can see that they were also connected to Harappa and Uzbekistan. Because of these movements from the coast to highlands of Central Asia, we know that people were going back and forth. Relationships were made. There were marriage relations, families were interconnecting, it made a huge network. Today we have countries and boundaries, in the past the areas were not divided.” 
The scholar said, “In Mehrgarh people were buried in the ground with jewellery. A lot of that jewellery came from the coast near Karachi. Some of it may have actually come from Oman. In one of the important discoveries in Mehrgarh, a kangan (bangle) made from a big shell was found. This shell was only found in the Hawkesbay area. We call it a shankh. It’s a wide bangle, a very big heavy bracelet. Women who wear heavy bracelets are women who work hard.” 
He claimed similar bracelets were discovered from bigger sites. “When I was doing my dissertation in the 1980s, I found a similar bangle in Harappa. I did not know that that bangle would be found later in Shahi Tump [Makran]. The bangle fragment from Harappa dates back to 4000BC. It means that a woman wearing one of those bangles probably was married into a family in Harappa, Punjab.” 
Mr Kenoyer said the same kind of bangle was found in Central Asia. Archaeologists had no idea that it was made from a shankh in the Karachi area. After mentioning a woman’s ornaments found during excavation in Tajikistan, he said, “We have now technology for DNA analysis. The woman’s DNA was: 80 per cent local and 20pc from the Indus region.” 
Abdul Ghaffar Soomro was the first main speaker at the conference. He informed the audience on the genesis of the Dr N A Baloch Institute and the great scholarly feats achieved by the late Dr Baloch. 
The Dr N A Baloch Award 2023 was also announced on the occasion. It was given posthumously to Dr Michael Jansen. 
Dr Asma Ibrahim briefly talked about Dr Jansen. 
The opening of the conference was followed by a technical session.

7,JI says talks with PTI over city mayor entered ‘advanced stage’,Hafiz Naeem warns PPP against ‘horse-trading’,"KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) on Saturday claimed that their talks with the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) for formation of the upcoming city and town councils had entered an advanced stage of negotiations.  
Addressing a press conference at Idara Noor-i-Haq, JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that they would counter the Pakistan Peoples Party’s ‘fascism’ by upholding the traditions of democracy and warned the ruling party in Sindh against staging a ‘market of conscience’ by ‘horse-trading’.  
The JI leader said it was strange that the PPP was celebrating its victory in the local government elections despite the fact that it was short of 24 votes to get its mayor elected in the mega city, and this was an obvious sign that some conspiracy was underway by unfair practices.  
The PPP was celebrating what they claim to be their ‘victory’, whereas it was an open secret that the party employed ‘unmatchable fascist tactics’ and state oppression to rig the polls and increase their numbers, he added.  

Hafiz Naeem warns PPP against ‘horse-trading’

He said that the total number of seats required to establish a local government in Karachi and win the election of Karachi mayor will be 184, whereas the total seats of the JI would reach 191 after coalition with the PTI.
Hafiz Naeem alleged that the Election Commission of Pakistan had been held hostage by the PPP.  
He criticised the PPP for amending the local government law at a time when the polls were held and the government was yet to be formed.  
The JI leader also condemned the Sindh government as well as the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics for ‘slashing’ the population of Karachi by half.  
He asked that the government to abstain itself from the politics of vendetta.  
Talking about the role of law enforcement agencies, he said that unfortunately Rangers played the role of only spectators in Karachi when the “PPP goons were rigging the elections and storming polling stations”.
Talking about the law and order situation across the country in general and Punjab in particular, the JI leader said that the government was responsible to maintain peace and order in the country. 
He said that the JI did not support the disturbance and violence in the name of protest at any cost, but at the same time the party also opposed any attempt to resort to undemocratic and draconian measures against a political party or group. 
He particularly condemned the government over arresting female political workers.
JI leaders Munim Zaffar, Raja Arif Sultan, Advocate Saifuddin, Abdul Wahab, Ishaq Khan, Abdul Razzaq, Zahid Askari and others were also present.

8,"Team formed to investigate man’s  ‘custodial death’, DIG tells court",HYDERABAD: The district and sessions court was informed by Hyderabad police range DIG Pir Mohammad Shah on Saturday...,"HYDERABAD: The district and sessions court was informed by Hyderabad police range DIG Pir Mohammad Shah on Saturday that a two-member team had been formed in compliance with the court orders to probe the killing of a man allegedly by some police and CIA officials in custody. The police had declared that the man, Farhan Siyal, was killed in an encounter.
The court had put the DIG on notice two days back after receiving an application from Siyal’s sister, Ms Reshma, who is fighting for justice in the alleged extrajudicial killing.
The DIG was ordered on April 18 to form a team to conduct a fair investigation into the matter and submit a report to the court on May 10 but he failed to comply with the order, prompting the applicant to file an application in the court seeking registration of FIR against the DIG for non-compliance of the court order.
The additional district judge-VII was informed about the team’s formation when the court took up the application for hearing. A board comprising SSP Thatta (chairman) and Hyder­abad SSP and SP (legal) Hyderabad range as members was constituted to examine FIR under sections 324, 353, 34 PPC and 25-A Sindh Arms Act filed at Phulelli police station.
The DIG said that recommendation for the board was sent to DIG Crime and Investigation Karachi to seek necessary permission. On receiving approval from the competent authority on April 28, investigation of the case was transferred to ASP Majida Parveen, SDPO Matli and DSP Abrar Awan on May 5 for further investigation with directives to submit compliance report to the court.
He said that ASP/SDPO Matli and DSP complaint cell Badin had been strictly directed to submit progress report to this court on May 13. Since the compliance of April 18’s order had been made, therefore the present application be dismissed, he said.
On April 18, the court had ordered that a team of two police officials, not below the rank of ASP from any district other than Hyderabad would conduct a thorough investigation into the FIR for the alleged police encounter. 
The court said the team would consider all aspects of the case and especially the applicant’s version. All parties, the order said, had the right to produce evidence in support of their claims and the team would be at liberty to call for verification of all evidence including weapons, bank accounts, mobile phones, cause of death including exhumation of the body of Farhan Siyal.
