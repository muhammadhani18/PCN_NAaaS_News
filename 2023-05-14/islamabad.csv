1,Nadra launches platform to track sex offenders,Nadra Chairman Tariq Malik says move aimed at preventing sexual violence and abuse.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) has developed National Sex Offenders Registry (NSOR) platform coupled with an SMS verification service to help citizens and institutions identify and track individuals convicted of sex crimes against children and women.
It is a dynamic database of sexual convicts. The links are established with various law enforcement departments and provincial governments so that updates are made in real time.
This move is aimed at making the service more dynamic and responsive to the needs of the institutions and people at large in preventing sexual violence and abuse.
 






An SMS-based verification service will alert citizens, employers and departments to beware of such culprits.
“This initiative has always remained close to my heart, which is a critical step towards safeguarding women and children from sexual violence and abuse,” according to Nadra Chairman Tariq Malik.

Move aimed at preventing sexual violence and abuse

He announced that citizens could now use this service to verify the CNIC number of individuals being hired for household chores, at mosques, colleges, universities, or any other employment to ensure they are not sexual convicts, have a clean record and can be trusted around women and children.
Mr Malik said: “Preventing even a single instance of child or woman from sexual abuse is not just an act of protection but also an investment in the future of our country.
We owe it to the weakest of the weak, and our nation has to take this responsibility seriously.
“We must recognise that preventing child and women sexual abuse is not just a matter of punishing offenders, but also of creating a culture of safety and protection for the most vulnerable segments [children and women]. Only then can we ensure that the next generation has the opportunity to thrive and succeed.”
The purpose of this service is to provide citizens and institutions with quick and easy access to information about sex offenders.
The information can also be used to locate offenders to prevent future crimes and ensure that they are held accountable for their actions.
Upon provision of CNIC by the individual being hired, the citizens can verify whether he is a convicted sex offender or not by sending a 13-digit CNIC number to 7000 (SMS short code). Upon verification he/she will receive a reply in Urdu: “Beware! ABC son of XYZ is a convict. Don’t let him be around children and women.”

4,Slow pace of development work at I-12 irks plot owners,"CDA chairman urged to grant early possession of plots, prioritise work on infrastructure","ISLAMABAD: Sector I-12’s plot owners have raised concerns over the sluggish pace of development, which has caused prolonged delays in acquiring possession of their plots.
Infrastructure, such as roads, sewage systems, and electricity connections, still needs to be completed, hindering the overall development of the sector. The slum dwellers are still there in the sector impeding the development process.
Tahir Mahmood, a plot owner, stated, “We have been waiting patiently for years, hoping to build our houses and secure a better future for our families. However, the slow pace of development has left us frustrated and financially burdened. In June 2022, it was announced that the development of the whole sector will be completed in three years but the pace of work shows that we will have to wait for many years.”
He urged the chairman of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to prioritise the completion of infrastructure and grant early possession of plots to the allottees, so they could finally build their homes.

CDA chairman urged to grant early possession of plots, prioritise work on infrastructure

Khumar Gul, another plot owner said, “The slow progress in the development work has left the plot owners in a state of uncertainty, as they continue to bear the burden of high rental costs while waiting for their plots to be made available for construction. This financial strain has put additional pressure on individuals already grappling with limited financial resources.”
Fahad Hameed, who also owns a plot in the sector, said, “The majority of these plot owners belong to the middle and poor class, who have been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to build their own homes on the land allocated to them.”
He argued that granting early possession of plots to the allottees would alleviate their financial burdens and will also empower them to materialise their dreams of owning a house.
“By eliminating the need to pay exorbitant rents, these individuals would be able to redirect their resources toward constructing their own homes, providing them with a sense of stability and security,” he said.
It is worth mentioning that in June 2022, the CDA chairman inaugurated the development work at I-12. It was announced that the sector would be developed in two phases. In the first phase, two sub-sectors i.e. I-12/2 and I-12/3 would be developed by a private contractor who won the contract worth Rs542 million a few months ago. It was announced that construction work in the remaining two sub-sectors i.e. I-12/1 and I-12/4 would be started in a few weeks by a government contractor.
Sector I-12 has over 6,000 residential plots. The sector was launched decades ago but no serious attempt was made for its development. Besides other challenges, the underdeveloped sector was also used as a dumping site for many years.
In the past, the Federal Investigation Agency had lodged an FIR against several CDA officials over irregularities pertaining to the construction of service roads in Sector I-12.

5,Timber mafia continues to illegally chop down precious trees in Hazro,TAXILA: The powerful timber mafia continues to wreak havoc as they have cut down precious trees planted decades ago...,"TAXILA: The powerful timber mafia continues to wreak havoc as they have cut down precious trees planted decades ago in Hazro town of Attock.
According to local sources, the timber mafia chopped a large number of eucalyptus trees systematically alongside Hazro-Gondal road, allegedly with the support of field officials from the forest department. It must be noted that this area is the home town of former special assistant to the prime minister on climate change Malik Amin Aslam Khan.
Sources said that cutting of trees in an organised manner in Hazro is not a secret anymore.
“So far, at different places, the mafia has cut down 11 eucalyptus trees, resultantly inflicting harm to forests,” said a local.
Sources in the forest department said that precious trees, which were planted several years ago are now being stolen with the help of field officers as the wood is used to make furniture. It must be observed that only well grown trees were being chopped down while the less expensive trees were left, which shows that the trees were not stolen for domestic purposes. They said that the forest guard, block officer, range officer and district forest officer had allegedly been covering up the issue as no legal or departmental action was taken.
Local villagers have raised their voices this cutting of trees. The illegal tree felling degrades the local environment, weakening the banks of water channels and decreasing the bird population, they said. Livelihoods of local people will also suffer because trees were a great source of fodder for livestock and honey bees. These things are a source of income to the people, said another villager.
Azam Khan, a resident of the area told this reporter that the timber mafia was active once again and several very large trees with diameters of around 4 feet had been chopped down. Some of the trees chopped down were between 15 to 20 years old and if sold in the open market, would fetch a hefty price between Rs15,000 to Rs25,000.
Saleem Alizai, another resident of the area said that illegal chopping of trees is going on under the very nose of the forest department. “These people are cutting down large trees at night following which the remaining parts of the trees are burnt down to avoid detection,” he said and claimed that people with political connections have been involved in the illegal cutting of trees.
Munaza Peerzada, president of a local non governmental organisation (NGO) said that the Forest Act 1927, which was almost 80 years old, had become obsolete and needed revision to meet the needs of the present time. “There are many loopholes and weaknesses in the act that are exploited by mafias,” she said.
“Deforestation at such a level has also caused degradation of watersheds, landslides, flooding, silting, extinction of thousands of species, soil erosion and the greenhouse effect,” she said.
“Various research studies prove that forests influence climate change in many ways, particularly by absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide,” she added.
When contacted, Divisional Forest officer Ishfaq Basheer Bhutta said that he was not aware of the chopping of trees along the road. He said that he would probe the matter and strict departmental action would be taken against the officials found guilty of negligence and legal action would be initiated against those involved in illegal chopping of trees.

The first day of the event covered basic disaster management concepts, climate science, hazard mapping, quantification and group-based activities on hazard analysis. This was essential for participants to familiarise themselves with the basics of disaster management and understand the potential hazards they might face in the region.
The scond day was devoted to vulnerability assessment at the district level, coordinating and managing camps and issuing master scenarios that indicated above-average monsoon forecasts. These scenarios highlighted the possibility of rain-induced landslides, flash flooding and possible GLOF events in various parts of the district.
On the third day, three scenarios were issued, highlighting events of flash floods causing significant havoc to populations, settlements, and infrastructure, as well as a scenario of GLOF and landslide. Each syndicate presented its response followed by a question and answer session.
Deputy Commissioner Ghizer retired Capt Tayyab Sami Khan appreciated NIMA’s efforts to develop the district stakeholders’ capabilities.
SimEx provided a platform to enhance the capacity of district-level stakeholders in disaster management and promote collaborative efforts towards ensuring preparedness and response during likely disasters.
The participants gained valuable knowledge and skills to enhance their response during emergencies.

7,Pro-army banners spring up in Rawalpindi,"Scores of placards have been affixed on lampposts from Marrir Chowk via Murree Road, as well as metro bus flyovers.","RAWALPINDI: Days after installations of the armed forces, including the General Headquarters (GHQ), were besieged by a mob in protest against the arrest of PTI chief Imran Khan, banners and billboards inscribed with pro-military slogans surfaced in Rawalpindi, excluding the cantonment areas, on Saturday.
During a visit from Marrir Chowk to Faizabad via Murree Road, it was observed that scores of placards had been affixed on lampposts along the road as well as metro bus flyovers. This token of solidarity with the military came from the ‘residents of Rawalpindi’ as claimed by the posters.
The PML-N also put up some banners expressing support for the military. Through these banners, the local PML-N leadership urged citizens to join a rally from Saddar to Faizabad on Saturday evening. The rally, however, was later cancelled.
“We wanted to express solidarity with the Pakistan Army after the attack on Jinnah House in Lahore (the residence of corps commander) and the GHQ. We wanted to take out the rally at late night, but the PDM decided to stage a sit-in in front of the Supreme Court so the rally was put off,” said Abrar Malik, a former PML-N MNA.
According to an official of the Parks and Horticulture Authority, these banners were put up without their permission as required by law. “The PHA staff will clear the pillars from all kinds of banners and the authority will take action against those who displayed these banners without its permission.”

Speakers say nurses worked tirelessly to serve patients during pandemic

Chief Organiser Pakistan Youth League Aabid Hussain said International Nurses Day was celebrated every year on May 12 to recognise the incredible work nurses do. 
The nurses work tirelessly to save lives and look after and care for people with complex health conditions often with little recognition. 
He acknowledged and appreciated nurses’ dedication, compassion and unwavering commitment to provide exceptional care to the patients.
Eminent educationist Shafqat Hayat said the role of nurses in serving humanity can never be neglected.
He said investment in nurses was crucial as the nursing department and its services played the role of a lifeline for humanity as there was no other noble profession than nursing.

He was addressing a meeting held to review the status of preparedness for the campaign. District health management teams from 12 districts, including the chief executive officers, district health officers and partner staff, participated in the meeting via video link.
The coordinator stressed on wrapping up the orientation of polio teams on time.
“I urge the district health administrations to wrap up team training on time. It also needs to ensure that training quality is up to the mark,” he said.
On the risk of virus importation from endemic zones, he asked the districts make adequate arrangements of vaccination of children at the transit points. He also urged them to make sure that all transitory and mobile populations who had entered Punjab to earn livelihoods are integrated into the micro-plans.
“Although Punjab is free of poliovirus, it is at the risk of imported virus recirculation. Therefore, the districts need to map and vaccinate every child belonging to the high-risk mobile populations,” he added.
He urged the Rajanpur district to reach out to the deputy commissioner to ensure provision of security to polio teams. “On the security situation in the riverine areas of Rojhan in the wake of police action against robbers, guidance should be taken from the deputy commissioner. A report should be submitted to the EOC before the campaign,” he observed.
He stressed that not a single child should be deprived of polio vaccine as this could give way to the virus to spread.
It may be noted that 12 districts of Punjab have been made part of the campaign. These are: Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Bhakkar, DG Khan, Layyah, Mianwali, Multan, Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Sheikhupura.
In Lahore, Rawalpindi and Faisalabad, the campaign will continue for seven days while in other districts it will last for five days.
Over 84,000 polio workers will participate in the drive to immunise 10.85 million children under the age of five.
Punjab has been free of polio cases since October 2020. The province’s last environmental samples that tested positive in January were linked to Afghanistan and southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Therefore, the provincial government is taking concrete steps to improve quality of campaigns and coverage of high-risk mobile populations at transit points.
