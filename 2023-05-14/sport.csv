0,Milinkovic-Savic saves late point for Lazio against Lecce,ROME: Sergej Milinkovic-Savic snatched a last-gasp point for Lazio with his stoppage-time leveller in Friday’s 2-2...,"ROME: Sergej Milinkovic-Savic snatched a last-gasp point for Lazio with his stoppage-time leveller in Friday’s 2-2 draw with Serie A strugglers Lecce but the capital club’s hopes of a top-four finish remain in jeopardy. 
Lecce winger Remi Oudin cancelled out a goal by striker Ciro Immobile before halftime, adding another one shortly after the break before Lazio grabbed a point in the 94th minute thanks to Milinkovic-Savic’s header, which trickled into the Lecce net. 
Maurizio Sarri’s side, who have earned only four points in their last five games, remain third on 65 points, provisionally two ahead of fourth-placed Inter Milan and four ahead of fifth-placed AC Milan. 
“I’m not so angry because in the end we won a point that can come in handy,” Lazio coach Sarri told DAZN. “The negative aspect is the naivety with which we took the goal for 1-1. “If we had equalised five minutes earlier we would have won, that was the feeling.” 
The visitors could have taken a surprise lead in a mostly dull first half when the referee pointed at the penalty spot for a foul on Alexis Blin but Gabriel Strefezza, Lecce’s top scorer with eight goals this season, sent the ball wide of the left post. 
Instead, Immobile put Lazio in front in the 34th minute from a typically neat through ball from Luis Alberto inside the box. 
Immobile, who also netted an opener in the reverse fixture, scored his 11th goal this season and his first in a home league match since September, prompting the fans to chant his name. 
The home crowd’s joy was short-lived though as Lecce equalised in first-half stoppage time through winger Oudin, who surprised Lazio keeper Ivan Provedel with a low shot from the edge of the box. 
Lecce continued to push and Oudin put them ahead six minutes into the second half with a single-touch goal. 
Lazio, who kept between 60% and 70% of possession throughout the game, repeatedly struggled in front of goal and forward Pedro hit the post from a distance in stoppage time. 
But Milinkovic-Savic salvaged one point for the home side just before the final whistle, netting on a rebound with a header. 
“It was an angry celebration because it was the equaliser. If it had been the winner it would have been better,” said Milinkovic-Savic. 
“We conceded two rather silly goals, the second after our own mistake. We need to improve our concentration and try to always bring home the three points. 
“We need to keep our heads up, we don’t have time to get down because we know where we are. We’re there [in the top four] and we have three matches left. It’s down to us.” 
His equaliser was a big blow for 16th-placed Lecce, as with three matches left in their season they are five points above Spezia who sit just inside the drop zone. 
Marco Baroni’s side host Spezia on Sunday week in a match which could either secure their safety or drag them further into the relegation dogfight, depending on how their rivals at the bottom of the table do this weekend. 
However Baroni was not downhearted after an impressive display from his team. 
“This is how we need to play, without any pressure, with this determination, aggression and solidity,” said Baroni.” We could have won the game but the most important thing is the performance, which we need to take with us into the next matches.”

1,Princess Sadia favourite for Liberty Cup,"Bay horse Gold Company, who was beaten by the filly by five lengths last month, is expected to challenge her again.","KARACHI: Filly Prin­cess Sadia looks fancied to clinch the Liberty Cup when it takes place in the Gymkhana race meeting here at the Karachi Racecourse on Sunday.
With two back-to-back wins under her belt, she is on course to complete a hat-trick should she maintain her form in a field of six horses in the four-furlong race under top scale order I, II and III.
It is the fourth race of a five-race card drawn for the day’s meeting. Bay horse Gold Company, who was beaten by the filly by five lengths last month, is expected to challenge her again.
Either of the two stable mates, filly Flaming Ember or bay horse Raging Comet, whoever is backed by connection, should dominate the fifth and supporting race under scale order IV and V being run over four furlongs. Both the horses have two victories apiece and look poised to extend their winning run.
At the outset, the opening race seems to be a two-horse affair between bay horses Canadian King and Zayan. The race which has half-a-dozen acceptors, will be held under scale order VIII and contested over four furlongs.
Bay horse Faisal King seems a good choice in the second race under scale order VIII to be run over four furlongs.
Another nine horses will face the starter in the third race under scale order VI and VII being run over four furlongs.
The first race starts at 1:30pm.

3,Pakistan U-19s clinch one-day series in BD,"Big victory gives the tourists an unbeatable 3-1 lead in the five-match series, with the last match to be played on Monday.","LAHORE: An impressive unbeaten century by Shahzaib Khan inspired Pakistan U-19 to an emphatic eight-wicket win over Bangladesh U-19 in the fourth youth one-day match at the Shaheed Kamruzzaman Stadium in Rajshahi on Saturday.
The big victory gave the tourists an unbeatable 3-1 lead in the five-match series. Pakistan comfortably won the first two one-dayers in Chittagong before Bangladesh came back to take the third game by four wickets in Rajshahi.
 






In pursuit of a modest 200, left-handed openers Shahzaib and Azan Awais provided the tourists with a match-winning partnership of 152 runs.
Shahzaib, who was later named man-of-the-match, crafted a run-a-ball innings of 105 cracking 14 fours and one six. Azan, who struck 105 in the second one-dayer, departed first after scoring a solid 91-ball 52 featuring seven boundaries.
Shamyl Hussain (7) was the next to go as Pakistan were 167 for two in 32.4 overs, before captain Saad Baig (29 not out off 15) joined Shahzaib to get the remaining 33 runs in their unbroken third-wicket stand in the 37th over.
Earlier, put in to bat first, Bangladesh posted a modest total of 199 in 46.4 overs.
Other than middle-order batter Ariful Islam (95-ball 50, four fours and a six), no other Bangladesh player could contribute handsomely as the hosts kept losing wickets regularly.
For Pakistan, fast bowler Aimal Khan and left-arm spinner Ali Asfand bagged three wickets each.
The last match of the series will be played on Monday at the same venue.
Summarised scores:
Pakistan U-19 bt Bangladesh U-19 by eight wickets.

Already the fastest woman in the world this year in the 100m, the 23-year-old American obliterated the field to win in a new meet time of 22.07 seconds.
Her victory in the 200m came a week after she won the 100m in a world-leading 10.76 seconds at the season-opening Diamond League meeting in Doha.
t was her first victory in the 200m this year after finishing second in the Botswana Grand Prix, the second leg of the World Athletics Continental Gold Tour in Gaborone on April 29.
With her Jamaican sprint rival Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce pulling out of the Nairobi event after suffering a knee injury on Thursday, Richardson was the star attraction at her maiden appearance in Kenya.
Omanyala also thrilled the home crowd as he beat off rivals including second-placed Kenny Bednarek of the USA in a time of 9.84, the best in the world this season.
But he failed to top his African record of 9.77 seconds set at the same event in 2021 Bednarek was second in 9.98 seconds with compatriot Marvin Bracy-Williams third in 10.03.

6,Lens closer to CL with Reims triumph,"Result puts second-placed Lens on 75 points with three games left, five ahead of third-placed Olympique de Marseille.","

LENS: RC Lens’ Seko Fofana (C) shoots to score against Stade de Reims during their Ligue 1 match at Stade Bollaert-Delelis.—AFP

 
LENS: RC Lens made another step towards qualification for next season’s Champions League with a 2-1 comeback home victory in Ligue 1 against Stade de Reims on Friday despite being reduced to 10 men early on. 
In front of a packed house, Lens also closed to within three points of Paris St Germain in the title race. 
Seko Fofana struck the winner in the second half after Przemyslaw Frankowski cancelled out Folarin Balogun’s opener with a penalty following the exclusion of Kevin Danso. 
The result put second-placed Lens on 75 points with three games left, five ahead of third-placed Olympique de Marseille. The top two teams qualify for the group phase of the Champions League while the third-placed side will play in the third qualifying round. 
“What’s happening this season is magical. We knew we’d have chances even when were down to 10 men,” said Lens midfielder Florian Sotoca. 
Reims went ahead on 23 minutes after being awarded a penalty when Danso was shown a straight red card for pushing Marshall Munetsi in the box. Balogun coolly slotted the spot kick past Brice Samba to give his team an early lead. 
Lens were however awarded a penalty five minutes before the break when Adrien Thomasson was fouled in the area by Emmanuel Agbadou and Polish midfielder Frankowski. who has not missed a penalty all season, made no mistake to level the tie. 
Against the odds, Fofana gave the hosts the advantage 10 minutes into the second half, beating two defenders with a mazy run before scoring with a superb low shot from just inside the box after being set up by Deiver Machado.

8,Ton-up Najmul helps BD win Ireland thriller,CHELMSFORD: Young Najmul Hossein hit a maiden One-day International century before Mushfiqur Rahim ensured ...,"CHELMSFORD: Young Najmul Hossein hit a maiden One-day International century before Mushfiqur Rahim ensured Bangladesh chased down 320 with three balls left in a tense three-wicket win over Ireland here at the County Ground on Friday despite Harry Tector’s career-best 140.
Batting at number three, left-handed Najmul cracked 117 off just 93 balls in front of a crowd largely made up of Bangladesh fans.
The victory gave Bangladesh a 1-0 lead in a three-match series after Tuesday’s rain-marred no-result at English county Essex’s headquarters.
Bangladesh veteran Mushfiqur, with four runs required off four balls, hit a boundary and finished 36 not out.
The 24-year-old Najmul, who eventually holed out off 
Curtis Campher, shared a fourth-wicket stand of 131 with Towhid Hridoy (68).
Earlier in the match, reduced by rain to 45 overs per side, 
Tector’s fourth century in his last nine ODI innings lifted Ireland to 319-6.
The 23-year-old struck seven fours and 10 sixes in a mere 113 balls, with George Dockrell making 74.
Bangladesh paceman Shoriful Islam conceded 83 runs in nine overs during an innings where Ireland struck a national record 16 sixes.
This series concludes on Sunday.
Tuesday’s washout, something Ireland hoped to avoid by moving the series to England, denied the Irish the 3-0 series clean sweep they needed to secure automatic entry into this year’s World Cup in India.
Ireland will now have to compete in the June 18-July 9 qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe, that also includes former champions West Indies and Sri Lanka.

9,Alcaraz powers to victory over Ramos-Vinolas on Rome debut,ROME: World number two Carlos Alcaraz marked his Italian Open debut by shaking off a sluggish start to emerge with ...,"

Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz hits a return against compatriot Albert Ramos-Vinolas during their Italian Open second-round match at Foro Italico on Saturday.—Reuters

 
ROME: World number two Carlos Alcaraz marked his Italian Open debut by shaking off a sluggish start to emerge with an efficient 6-4, 6-1 second-round win over unseeded Spaniard Albert Ramos-Vinolas on a rain-affected Saturday in Rome. 
Barcelona and Madrid champion Alcaraz, who is chasing his fifth title of 2023 and fourth on clay ahead of Roland Garros, overcame an early loss of serve amid heavy conditions at the Foro Italico to level up the opening set at 2-2. 
The 20-year-old, who had a first-round bye, earned another chance to break Ramos-Vinolas with a deft drop shot in an intense 10th game and took the advantage in the match when his compatriot finally cracked under the pressure and sent a forehand long. 
Alcaraz continued to build momentum and raced ahead 3-0 in the second set against a fading Ramos-Vinolas, wrapping up the match on serve to make it 12 wins in a row. 
“It wasn’t easy,” said Alcaraz, who will now leapfrog Novak Djokovic into top spot in the rankings on May 22. “The first round of every tournament is really tough and, of course, Ramos-Vinolas is a specialist on clay. I had to adapt my game quickly to be able to go through. 
“The conditions weren’t easy, the rain and the waiting all day to know if I’m going to be able to play... but I’m really happy with my performance in the end.” 
Monte Carlo champion Andrey Rublev earlier overcame Alex Molcan 6-3 6-4 in a twice-interrupted match to book his place in the third round. 
“I’m happy that I was able to finish just before the rain,” Rublev said as the showers arrived again following the clash. “I can rest now and I can rest tomorrow. I don’t need to stress waiting until the afternoon.” 
Rublev’s Russian compatriot Daniil Medvedev will not have that luxury, however, and will look for his first victory in Rome when he opens his campaign against Finn Emil Ruusuvuori in a late fixture. 
Qualifier Camila Osorio served up another shock in the women’s draw after her win over 29th seed Petra Martic, when the Colombian downed world number four Caroline Garcia 6-4, 6-4 to make the round of 16. 
Osorio almost broke down in tears after her shock straight sets victory over Garcia, a two-time doubles winner at the French Open.  
A career-best win for world number 100 Osorio puts her in the last 16 of a WTA 1000 event for the first time in her career. She will face either Beatriz Haddad Maia or Magda Linette in the next round.  
“I literally have no words to describe what I’m feeling right now,” said Osorio on court. “I’ve been struggling a little bit with my injuries and now that I’m back playing and beating the number four in the world I can’t believe it. I’m just super happy and proud about how I managed to stay calm and finish the match.”  
Garcia joins world number two Aryna Sabalenka, third-ranked Jessica Pegula, 2019 winner Karolina Pliskova and world number seven Ons Jabuer in being dumped out of the tournament.  
Sofia Kenin’s resurgent run came to an end as the former Australian Open champion, who took out Sabalenka in the previous round, failed to find a way past Anhelina Kalinina to lose 6-4, 6-2.  
On Friday night, Djokovic began his hunt for a seventh title by battling past the unseeded Tomas Martin Etcheverry 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.   
The world number one was made to work by the 61st-ranked Argentine, prevailing in one hour, 51 minutes to set up a third round clash with Grigor Dimitrov who beat Stan Wawrinka 6-4, 7-6 (7-3).   
Italian veteran Fabio Fognini celebrated a 6-3, 7-6 (6) win over Miomir Kecmanovic by bringing his five-year-old son, Federico, out onto the court with him on the statue-lined Pietrangeli stadium.   
Fognini next faces world number seven Holger Rune, who marked his Rome debut with a 6-3, 6-3 win against 18-year-old French qualifier Arthur Fils, while Gregoire Barrere upset 11th-ranked Karen Khachanov 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).   
In women’s action,, Jelena Ostapenko overcame Sorana Cirstea 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 and was joined in the next round by fellow former Roland Garros champion Barbora Krejcikova who advanced after an ailing Danka Kovinic retired while trailing 6-2, 4-1.   
Karolina Muchova eliminated the top Italian woman, 18th-seeded Martina Trevisan, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5.

Hazlewood has not played any red-ball cricket since injuring his Achilles in the Sydney Test against South Africa in January and only recently made his comeback in the Indian Premier League.
McDonald told the Sydney Daily Telegraph Hazlewood was  “building nicely” for the World Test Championship against India at the 
Oval from June 7-11 ahead of the five-Test Ashes series.
But the in-form Neser and Abbott, playing county cricket with Glamorgan and Surrey respectively, would nevertheless join the squad’s training camp.
“So far so good. He’s pulling up well from each encounter he has in the IPL,” McDonald said of Hazlewood.
“We’re hopeful all four of those quicks in that squad [Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Scott Boland] are up and available through the whole six Test matches.
“If not, then clearly we’ve got some really handy back-up [Neser and Abbott] that we’re including in the camp.”
Neser was controversially omitted from Australia’s 17-man squad for the World Test Championship final and first two Ashes Tests, but selectors left the door open for the final three matches.
He has been in irresistible form for Glamorgan, taking a career-best 
7-32, including a hat-trick, last week against Yorkshire. He followed up by grabbing 4-40 and smacking 86 against Worcestershire this week.

11,"United close on Champions League return, Southampton relegated",MANCHESTER: Manc­hester United edged closer to a return to the Champions League next season with a 2-0 win over...,"MANCHESTER: Manc­hester United edged closer to a return to the Champions League next season with a 2-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers as Southampton were relegated from the Premier League on Saturday.
Newcastle United remain ahead of United on goal difference in third after being held 2-2 in a pulsating game as Sam Allardyce picked up his first point at Leeds manager.
United have stumbled towards a top-four finish in recent weeks after an exhau­sting season that will stretch to 62 games.
Erik ten Hag’s men had won just two of their previous eight games from open play in all competitions. But they shrugged off the absence of Marcus Rashford due to injury for a vital three points.
Wolves were welcome visitors at Old Trafford as the Premier League’s lowest scorers rarely troubled the under-fire David de Gea.
Scoring goals has also been a problem for the Red Devils of late but Antony squared for Anthony Martial to slam home on 32 minutes.
Alejandro Garnacho then came off the bench to secure the points deep into stoppage time.
Newcastle and Manchester United are now four points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool with three games to go.
There was far more action at Elland Road where Leeds got a point but did not do enough to move out of the relegation zone.
Luke Ayling gave Allard­yce’s men a flying start, but they shot themselves in the foot three times.
Firstly, Patrick Bamford saw a penalty saved by Nick Pope. Three minutes later, Newc­astle did level from the spot through Callum Wilson after Alexander Isak was fouled.
Wilson converted a second penalty midway through the second half when Junior Firpo handled inside his own box.
Rasmus Kristensen’s deflected effort brought Leeds level again 11 minutes from time. But they were forced to see out stoppage time with 10 men after Firpo was shown his second yellow card.
“We missed a penalty, gave two away and drew 2-2,” said Allardyce.  “I think we’d be saying what a great three points if we scored that penalty for 2-0.”
Leeds close to within 
one point of safety, but that gap could grow if Everton shock leaders Manchester City on Sunday.
Nottingham Forest remain three points clear of the relegation zone after their own four-goal thriller at Chelsea ended 2-2.
Taiwo Awoniyi’s bullet header opened the scoring for the visitors.
Raheem Sterling’s quickfire double turned the game around in seven second-half minutes.
But Awoniyi had the final say as he headed in once more from a long throw for his fourth goal in a week that could prove vital to keeping Forest up on their return to the top flight for the first time in 23 years.
Southampton’s 11-year stay in the Premier League, though, is over after a meek 2-0 home defeat by Fulham summed up the Saints’ season.
Carlos Vinicius and Aleksandar Mitrovic, on his return from an eight-game ban for pushing a referee, got the goals which moved Fulham up to ninth.
Defeat leaves Southampton still eight points adrift of safety with just two games remaining.
In the battle for a place in the Europa League next season, Aston Villa beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 to move level on points with Spurs in sixth.

12,Martin claims first sprint win at French MotoGP,LE MANS: Jorge Martin of Pramac Racing produced a flawless performance to hold off Brad Binder and world champion...,"LE MANS: Jorge Martin of Pramac Racing produced a flawless performance to hold off Brad Binder and world champion Francesco Bagnaia and win his first sprint race at the French MotoGP in Le Mans on Saturday. 
Bagnaia retained the lead in the championship standings ahead of Sunday’s main race with South African Binder moving into second. 
Six-time world champion Marc Marquez came in fifth, behind Luca Marini of VR46 Ducati, on his comeback after injury requiring surgery in the season-opening race in Portugal. 
For Martin this was a return to the top of the podium for the first time since his one and only MotoGP win in 2021. 
Setting off in fifth on the grid the Spaniard got a dream start to go second, before hitting the front and holding off Binder’s KTM comfortably to pick up the 12 points. 
“I’m super proud, coming back to be first after a long time, even if it’s ‘only’ in the sprint but it’s good for energy and for tomorrow” he said. 
“Maintaining that gap with Brad wasn’t easy,” he added after finally claiming the win following two podium placed-finishes in the dash that is a feature of every MotoGP weekend this year. 
Bagnaia, who took pole earlier on Saturday and will start there again for Sunday’s main event, had a terrific scrap with Marquez and now leads the standings by 23 points. 
“My objective was to win, but I lost position, Marc was aggressive, it was tense out there, I was losing time, but then everything turned out okay,” said the Ducati factory star. 
For Binder this was another profitable sprint performance after winning the dash in Spain last time out and Argentina. 
“I knew the start was everything, I knew I could bring it home in a decent spot,” said Binder who came through from only qualifying 10th on the grid. 
The afternoon did not go well for both Jack Miller, the Australian crashing his KTM at the end of the opening lap — and Fabio Quartararo. 
France’s 2021 world champion was always going to be up against it after only starting off in 13th, on the fifth row, on his struggling Yamaha. 
And his day went from bad to worse in front of his home fans after he slid off his bike with four laps to go.

13,Ireland’s Healy solos  to Giro stage win as Evenepoel loses time,FOSSOMBRONE: Iris­h­­man Ben Healy’s season got even better on Satur­day when pulled off a long-range ...,"FOSSOMBRONE: Iris­h­­man Ben Healy’s season got even better on Satur­day when pulled off a long-range breakaway to win the eighth stage of the Giro d’Italia, a 207-km ride from Terni to Fossom­brone, whi­le pre-race favourite Remco Even­epoel lost time. 
The 22-year-old EF Education-Easy Post rider Healy jumped away from the day’s breakaway on the first of two ascents of the I Cappucini climb. 
Healy went on to bag his third win of the season, after also taking a surprising fourth place in the Liege-Bastogne-Liege Monument classic last month. 
“I had great legs and nobody could follow me, so it was a great day,” said Healy, who has broken through this year coming second to Tadej Pogacar in April’s Amstel Gold Race. 
Canadian Derek Gee and Italian Filippo Zana took second and third place, respectively. 
Drama unfolded in the overall race as Primoz Roglic attacked Evenepoel.
On the second ascent of I Cappucini, triple Vuelta champion Roglic managed to drop his main rivals for the title, only for  Ineos pair Geraint Thomas and Tao Geoghegan Hart to reel him in further up the  road. 
Evenepoel, however, failed to sustain the pace and crossed the finish line 14 seconds behind those three, while Norway’s Andreas Lekn­essund finished some 20 seconds further adrift though he retained the overall leader’s Maglia Rosa. 
Evenepoel had come under criticism overnight for having returned to his hotel from an Apennine peak by helicopter. 
Leknessund leads Evenepoel by eight seconds overall with Roglic in third place, 38 seconds off the pace. 
Hart, the 2020 Giro champion, moved up to sixth 56 seconds behind Leknessund. 
Other fancied riders Damiano Caruso and Joao Almeida kept pace and Ineos pair Thomas and Hart seemed to have brushed off the loss of teammate Filippo Ganna who has Covid. 
Leknessund is almost certain to lose his pink overall jersey on Sunday when the Giro stages its second of three individual time trials, a 35km run to Cesena.
