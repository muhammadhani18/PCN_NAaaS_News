LAHORE: Setting a deadline of 72 hours for the arrest of culprits involved in violence that erupted after PTI chief was pick­ed up, Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif on Saturday said “it is time to do or die or now or never”.
The prime minister while blaming the PTI chief and his followers for arson and violent attacks said, “The real culprits who showed this kind of enmity against the motherland should be arrested and produced in anti-terrorism courts under the relevant laws. These elements should be arrested immediately, without fear or favour”.
In a related development, the caretaker Punjab government constituted a joint investigation team (JIT) to probe the torching of the corps commander’s official residence, also known as Jinnah House.
 
 

PM Shehbaz visited the Punjab Safe Cities Authority and the corps commander’s house to take stock of the situation four days after protesters went on the rampage following the arrest of Imran Khan.
In a tweet, the PM said that all those involved in facilitating, abetting and perpetrating the disgraceful incidents of arson, ransacking, sabotage and damaging public and private properties will be arrested.
 






Mr Sharif said all available technical and intelligence resources were being deployed to chase down these arsonists, as he vowed to make it a “test case for the government”.
“The cases of vandalism will be tried by anti-terrorism courts,” the premier said, adding that the law minister had been instructed to increase the number of such courts for the purpose.
He alleged that PTI Chairman Imran Khan and his “armed followers” acted like the enemies of Pakistan.
The prime minister said the whole nation, except Mr Khan and his armed followers were “in an utter state of grief over the painful incidents”.
“It is now or never,” said the prime minister who vowed to show no mercy towards the attackers who “showed enmity against the motherland”.
‘Barbaric act’
During his visit to Jinnah House, the PM held Mr Khan responsible for the “barbaric act of torching the corps commander residence”.
Talking to the media after his visit, he claimed Mr Khan planned and instigated the attack“.
He reiterated his pledge to arrest all the culprits who “neither cared about the historical significance of the building nor of the fact that an army officer and his family were living there”.
 






“The building was inhabited by the son of the land who was on duty to protect the motherland,” PM Sharif remarked.
He said this was a barbaric attack “on the sons of the soil who are eradicating terrorism from the country”.
“They have protected the motherland with their blood while leaving behind bereaved families,” the PM said, adding that “PTI rioters defiled the martyrs” and attacked their monuments.
The prime minister also visited the Combined Military Hospital and Services Hospital in Lahore. He met with the injured police officers, including Lahore DIG Operations Ali Nasir Rizvi, who came face to face with protesters on May 9.
The PM also censured his nemesis on social media, taking exception to Mr Khan’s statement accusing the army chief of orchestrating his arrest, APP reported.
He said the PTI chairman’s statement about the army chief was “a reflection of his diseased and obsessive mindset”.
He continued that as the ISI head Gen Asim Munir had “unearthed a corruption syndicate of [Mr Khan]”.
“That’s why he had been maligning the chief of army staff (COAS) from day one,” he tweeted.
“The desecration of the martyrs’ monuments and attack on the national installations represent an unimaginable low in our politics.”
The JIT
The Punjab government formed a JIT to probe the attack on Jinnah House and vandalising of other military and civil installations in the province, according to a statement.
This was announced on Saturday following a meeting, chaired by Punjab CM Naqvi, to review the law and order situation.
While the government has formed a probe team, it has yet to order an investigation into how the protesters managed to reach the corps commander’s house, located inside the fortified Lahore Cantonment. Moreover, no blame has yet been pinned on police and other officials for not resisting the protesters’ rampage.
Later in a tweet, Mr Naqvi said: “Anyone giving statements against Pakistan Army and its Generals is Enemy of the state. We shall not surrender to any anti-state propaganda.”

1,Imran seeks ‘independent’ investigation into riots,"Advises army to form political party, stop taking decisions behind closed doors; announces rallies from Wednesday.","• Advises army to form political party, stop taking decisions behind closed doors
• Announces rallies from Wednesday; asks police, media to snub ‘unjustified’ orders of ‘handlers’
LAHORE: PTI Chair­man Imran Khan deman­ded an independent investigation into the May 9 incident of torching national public buildings, including the corps commander’s residence in Lahore and firing on unarmed protesters, by an independent panel to be constituted by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial.
“I know, who wants to create anarchy in the country and take benefit of the tense situation,” Mr Khan asserted in an hour-long maiden speech after the Islamabad High Court gave him blanket relief in all 145 cases registered against him. Mr Khan was speaking through video link from his Zaman Park residence on Saturday.
He said those ves­ted interest elements did take some benefit by putting PTI’s all senior leadership as well as around 3,500 workers behind bars.
 
 

During the address, video clips were shown that how army trucks dropped ‘unidentified’ plainclothesmen, who joined PTI protesters and provoked them to unleash violence and ransack public property.
Asserting that “violence and vandalism is not my philosophy”, the PTI chairman said his party workers did not go for violent protests even when he was attacked in Wazirabad, not even when party activists were attacked on May 25 last year, and neither on March 8 when the police clashed with them at an election rally in Lahore.
 






Speaking about cases as well as allegations levelled by ISPR, Mr Khan called out the NAB DG as well as his handlers as “unscrupulous and shameless” for instituting a case of corruption against him and his wife without any proof. He explained that the $170 million amount was transferred to the Supreme Court following a cabinet decision in the aftermath of a confidential agreement between Britain’s National Crime Agency and property tycoon Malik Riaz.
“The federal cabinet under my leadership decided not to go into litigation because Pakistan had already lost some $100 million in foreign litigations and let the money come to Pakistan,” he explained.
He also said that Al Qadir University was a trust and the trustees do not even take any salary.
ISPR allegations
The former prime minister took strong exception to the ISPR allegations against him and said that the ISPR [spokesperson] was not even born, when he was representing Pakistan in the world.
“I kept Pakistan’s flag high world over,” Mr Khan asserted. “Never has ISPR made such a statement. You should be ashamed of yourself. You have jumped into politics. Why don’t you make a [political] party,” Mr Khan said in a harsh rejoinder to claims made by the army’s media wing.
 






Mr Khan said he was the only person, who defended Pakistan when Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan and everyone had gone silent. “The former army chief stabbed me in the back and brought looters and plunders to power that led masses to criticise the former army chief,” he said and quoted examples of Memogate and Dawn Leaks.
He also took exception to the ISPR’s claim that he had levelled baseless allegations and asserted that Constitution gave him the right to get an FIR registered against the suspects who facilitated an attack on him.
The PTI chairman suggested that the army should stop taking decisions behind closed doors and expand its circle of discussion to save Pakistan from heading towards imminent disaster.
“Nobody can eliminate a political party by force and putting them in jail,” he reiterated.
Mr Khan said the nation had resolved that it would not accept slavery anymore and continue the jihad to earn “Haqeeqi Azadi”.
He lamented that unarmed youth was peacefully protesting when they were shot at leaving several workers dead and scores injured.
“We will visit the families of all those killed and injured and collect money to help them in the long run,” he stated.
Mr Khan also raised a question and demanded an investigation that why there were no police or soldiers to stop the peaceful protesters marching towards the Corps Commander’s House and eventually entering the premises without any resistance.
“There were specially launched miscreants that ransacked and set the Jinnah House on fire,” he alleged.
The PTI chief also chided all those involved in taking journalist Imran Riaz Khan to some unknown place and expressed his fear that he would be tortured since he was not towing the “imported” government’s line. He also said that several other journalists, including Aftab Iqbal, were picked and tortured. “Such a situation will take Pakistan to the East Pakistan-like situation,” he feared.
Mr Khan urged the masses to come out of their homes, and stand in their respective streets carrying placards with inscriptions “Haqeeqi Azadi” and “Save Constitution — Save Pakistan” for an hour on Sunday (today) from 5:30pm.
Stop taking orders
The ex-PM announced that he would start his mass public rallies next Wednesday in Muridke. Stating that independence needs to be snatched, he urged policemen, judges, journalists and other state functionaries to stop taking ‘unjustified’ orders from the ‘handlers’. He said those handlers were baffled when he was granted blanket relief as bail in all 145 cases and did not allow him to move from the IHC for several hours.
“Not a single criminal case was instituted against me during my 50-year public life, but this regime lodged 145 cases, including terrorism and mutiny,” he said.

2,Social media sites stay inaccessible as govt fears ‘exploitation’,PTA officials say the restriction of Twitter was never lifted as it had been directed not to do so.,"ISLAMABAD: While mobile data services were restored late on Friday night, access to key social media platforms remained restricted a day later, as the interior ministry is yet to allow access to those platforms.
As violent protests broke out following the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan, the government pulled the plug on mobile internet on May 9 and blocked Twitter, Facebook and YouTube where videos of vandalism were being shared.
Four days later on Friday, and after severe pressure from several quarters to restore the internet and social media sites, the interior ministry ordered the Pakistan Telecommunication Auth­o­rity (PTA) to lift the restrictions.
 
 

The mobile internet services resumed at around 10pm, but Twitter and other social media websites remained inaccessible even on Saturday.
According to the  telecommunication authority officials, the restriction on Twitter was never lifted as the ministry had directed the regulator to not open the platform.
A senior information ministry official, on the condition of anonymity, said the government feared that the social media platform “will be used for political mileage by the opposition”.

3,PCB names Bradburn new head coach,KARACHI: Pakistan on Saturday appointed former New Zealand player Grant Bradburn as head coach of their men’s...,"KARACHI: Pakistan on Saturday appointed former New Zealand player Grant Bradburn as head coach of their men’s cricket team for the next two years after he served on an interim basis.
The 56-year-old, who played seven Tests and 11 ODIs for New Zealand, will be working under Mickey Arthur, who was appointed team director in March.
“Bradburn has been app­o­inted as the head coach of the Pakistan men’s team for the next two years after a robust rec­ruitment process,” the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced in a press release.
Bradburn replaces former spinner Saqlain Mushtaq, whose contract expired in February.
Pakistan had Abdur Rehman as interim coach for a Twenty20 series in Sha­rjah in March, while Bra­dburn oversaw the coaching during 10 limited over matches against New Zealand in April and May.
Bradburn, who also served as Pakistan’s fielding coach from 2018 to 2020, vowed to guide the team in major events.
The PCB said the team’s management had unveiled a playing style with which they will approach the 2023 ODI World Cup in India.
The style, branded “The Pakistan Way”, aims to see the team employ bold tactics and attacking strategies.

The army chief, during his visit to the provincial capital on Saturday, said that any further attempt to violate the sanctity and security of military properties will be severely dealt with, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
Calling May 9 “a Black Day”, the COAS resolved to hold to account the “planners, abettors, instigators and executors” of the acts of vandalism.
“A concerted effort is being made maliciously by inimical elements to target the armed forces,” ISPR said while quoting Gen Munir.
He claimed that information warfare was ongoing to create misconceptions about the army.
“Such nefarious attempts will be foiled with the support of the people of Pakistan,” Gen Munir vowed.
The COAS also visited the corps headquarters where he was given a briefing on the security situation and ongoing counter-terrorism efforts.
In his address to the officers and soldiers, the COAS emphasised the importance of efforts to restore peace and stability. 
“We shall continue with our endeavours of peace and stability and there will be no room for spoilers of the process,” he said.
The army chief appreciated the professional competence of the force and hailed the performance and achievements of law enforcement agencies in the ongoing fight against terrorism.

5,SCBA urges restraint as PDM gears up for sit-in,Maryam arrives in Islamabad for protest outside SC building; SC registrar briefed on security arrangements.,"• Maryam arrives in capital for protest outside SC building
• Registrar briefed on security arrangements
ISLAMABAD: As the ruling coalition goes ahead with its plan to stage a sit-in against the judiciary for allegedly favouring PTI chief Imran Khan, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has urged political parties to refrain from such a move.
And to pre-empt any untoward incident, the Supreme Court’s registrar, Ishrat Ali, on Saturday called a meeting of the Islamabad administration and police for a briefing on security arrangements.
The protest was announced by JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Reh­man, who also heads the Pak­istan Democratic Movement (PDM) alliance, on Friday. The sit-in has been planned at Constitution Avenue in Islamabad, outside the Supreme Court building, on Monday, when the top court is set to start hearing an Election Commission’s petition seeking to revisit its verdict on the Punjab polls date.
The PML-N has announced that its chief organiser, Mar­yam Nawaz, has already arri­ved in Islamabad to take part in the sit-in.
In a statement, SCBA Presi­dent Abid S. Zuberi and Secr­e­tary Muqtedir Akhtar Shab­bir requested the ruling political parties not to hold the pro­test or take action that may undermine the integrity and functioning of the judiciary.
They also called upon the political stakeholders to reduce the political temperature in the best interest of the country’s progress.
The statement said the bar stood with the rule of law, supremacy of the Constitution and the independence of judiciary and had extended their unwavering support and solidarity in protecting the Supreme Court against the announced protest on Monday by political parties.
The statement also expressed their strong disapproval of any attempt to undermine the sanctity and integrity of the apex court.
It said that violence in any form would be in violation of law and would amount to a thr­eat to peace and public order, especially when Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure — an emergency law that prohibits gatherings — and Article 245 of the Constitution, under which the army is called in to help the civil administration, had already been invoked in the federal capital.
Therefore, it is incumbent upon the federal government, law enforcement agencies and its relevant subsidiaries to make foolproof security arrangements to ensure the safety and protection of the Supreme Court, it said.
It said the SCBA was deeply committed to upholding the Constitution, the principles of the rule of law and the integrity of judicial institutions. “While we recognise and respect the right to peaceful protest and freedom of expression, we firmly believe that any attempt to undermine or challenge the authority of the Supreme Court is detrimental to the foundations of democracy,” it said.
The statement said that engaging in protests against the Supreme Court, particularly those aimed at eroding public trust in its decisions, compromised the essence of the rule of law. It said the SCBA in particular and the entire legal fraternity in general stood united in their commitment to protect the Supreme Court, the Constitution and the rule of law.
Security briefing
The briefing to the Supreme Court’s registrar was attended by Islamabad’s deputy commissioner, Irfan Nawaz Memon. However, informed sources said Islamabad’s AIG of the special branch and SSPs for operations, security and traffic could not reach the court premises.
During the meeting, instructions were also issued to ensure appropriate arrangements to avoid any untoward incident and to ensure foolproof security.
If no security was provided by the Islamabad police, sources said, the deployment of armed forces outside the apex court might also be considered.
However, it is expected that a heavy contingent of the Rangers paramilitary may be deployed at the Supreme Court to protect its premises.
The security has been tightened to such an extent that no one would be allowed to enter the apex court’s premises except reporters who cover court proceedings daily.
Maryam in Islamabad
Meanwhile, PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz arrived in Islamabad on Saturday to participate in the PDM sit-in.
“On the instructions of [PML-N] Quaid Nawaz Sharif and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz will represent the PML-N in the sit-in,” said Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said in a statement.
Separately, when asked about the ruling coalition’s Monday sit-in, Interior Minister Sanaullah said at a press conference that protests in the red zone had taken place in the past as well. He said permission would be sought from the district administration.
Similarly, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told reporters in Sialkot that the ruling alliance was staging the sit-in to press the judiciary to play its actual role instead of “acting as a facilitator of an individual”.
