0,"Banning PTI only solution, insists interior minister","Alleges PTI chief Imran Khan recruited, armed and trained thousands of ""miscreants"".","ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah on Saturday said banning the PTI was the only solution and accused party chief Imran Khan of recruiting, organising, training and arming thousands of miscreants across the country over a decade.
Mr Sanaullah also criticised the Supreme Court and the Islamabad High Court for giving “extraordinary relief” to the PTI chairman in several cases — an assertion also hammered home on Saturday by other key ministers, including Climate Minister Sherry Rehman and Defence Minister Khwaja Asif.
 
 

Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad, Mr Sanaullah even said that Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari — who earlier this week turned down suggestions to ban the PTI — had not opposed the idea.
What Mr Bhutto-Zardari actually said, according to Mr Sanaullah, was that he did not like a ban on political parties but also stressed that “we will be compelled to do it if he (Imran Khan) does not change his behaviour”.

Alleges Imran recruited, armed, trained thousands of ‘miscreants’

On the judiciary’s role, he said the chief justice not only welcomed the “criminal” but also passed an order for Mr Khan’s stay at a government building as a guest with the freedom to meet visitors of his choice.
“This will have consequences”, he said, as it would encourage others to engage terrorists to achieve their designs.
The protesters who took part in the arson and vandalism of May 9 after Mr Khan’s arrest would not be spared, Mr Sanaullah said, repeating a warning also issued by the prime minister and the military over the past days.
He alleged all these “goons” burnt houses and defence installations on Mr Khan’s directives and warned that they would be identified through CCTV camera footage.
Sharing the number of protesters, he said some 40,000 to 45,000 people had participated during the three days of riots erupted after Mr Khan’s arrest in a corruption case on Tuesday.
He, however, could not give a clear reply when asked why the army had been called in under Article 245 of the Constitution if the number of protesters was so small and why the government appeared to be helpless despite the presence of thousands of law-enforcement officials.
Asked how the government would react in case of contempt proceedings were initiated over the failure to hold Punjab Assembly polls on May 14, he said: “Let it happen and we will see.”
‘No one is above Pakistan’
Meanwhile, Climate Minister Rehman accused Mr Khan of prioritising his own interests over those of the state, government and citizens.
“No one is above Pakistan, despite Imran Niazi’s messaging of being above the state,” she told reporters in Islamabad. “Imran Khan Niazi neither believes in politics nor in the democratic process. His tactics boil down to a premeditated bonfire of violence and chaos.”
She said the PTI chief was once again targeting state institutions, with his latest target being the army chief, as Mr Khan seemed desperate to cut a bargain. “But this time, no one is going to adopt him except his current connections in the courts,” she said.
The climate minister also highlighted what she said were injustices in the legal system and pointed out contrasts between the treatment of Mr Khan and other political leaders.
‘Unprecedented relief’
In Sialkot, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also questioned the alleged facilitation provided to Mr Khan by courts, insisting that the “unprecedented relief” given to the PTI chief has dented the judiciary’s impartiality.
The judiciary should act according to the Constitution and law instead of personal liking and disliking, he said at a presser at his home on Saturday, the state-run APP news agency reported.
On violent protests, he said if the army and police had reacted to those incidents, the state would have suffered and Mr Khan’s “ulterior motives” would have been fulfilled.

1,"Sadpara, Naila launch Everest summit push",GILGIT: Pakistani mou­ntaineers Sajid Ali Sad­para and Naila Kiani started their journey towards the summit of...,"GILGIT: Pakistani mou­ntaineers Sajid Ali Sad­para and Naila Kiani started their journey towards the summit of Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world, on Saturday evening, aiming to reach the top by Sunday. 
If everything goes well, the two climbers who are ascending the mountain separately will be at the top of the mountain this morning.
Sajid Sadpara, the son of the legendary mountaineer late Muhammad Ali Sadpara, reached Camp 4 on Saturday and started his summit push in the evening. Karar Haidri, general secretary of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, told Dawn that Mr Sadpara will be the first Pakistani to summit the world’s tallest mountain without additional oxygen and sherpa support.
Mr Sadpara has already summited several high peaks, including K2 (8,611m), Gasherbrum-I (8,080m), and Gasher­br­um-II (8,035m) in Pakis­tan, as well as Manaslu (8,163m) in Nepal, without supplemental oxygen. His ultimate goal is to climb all 14 eight-thousanders without the aid of supplemental oxygen.
Naila Kiani, who is a member of Imagine Nepal team, also started her summit push of Everest with Nepalese sherpas in the evening. 
In her last message before the push, the climber said she was leaving for Camp 4 shortly from where she would move towards the summit. 
Mingma Gyalje Sherpa, who is considered to be the fastest climber, is the head of Imagine Nepal. He told Dawn that the team had started the summit push on Saturday. 
He said if everything goes under the plan, the team will successfully summit the peak on Sunday.
Alpine Club official Karar Haidri said Naila Kiani is the first Pakistani woman to summit four peaks of over 8,000m.

2,Bilawal asks judges not to become ‘Tiger Force’,"Says if justice is not served, then PPP will ""snatch"" it.","KARACHI: In light of extraordinary relief extended to Imran Khan by the Supreme Court, Foreign Minister and chairman of Pakistan Peoples Party Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Saturday asked the judiciary to refrain from becoming ‘Tiger Force’ — a reference to the youth wing of Imran Khan’s PTI, and warned that the PPP would “snatch justice if it is not served”.
While addressing a rally at I.I. Chundrigar Road to celebrate the PPP’s success in the recent local elections in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, the PPP chairman warned the growing interference of judiciary in political affairs could lead to call from his PPP to mark the death anniversaries of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto inside the Supreme Court.
The PPP chairman asked the judges to do “justice” and “not politics”, recalling the recent history of a “highly politicised” judiciary which was allegedly part of rigging in the previous two general elections.

Says if justice is not served, then PPP will ‘snatch’ it

Blaming the judiciary for “becoming highly politicised again” before the next general elections, he warned that the PPP would not tolerate any rigging by the judiciary or establishment in the next polls.
The PPP chairman also maintained the same critical and harsh tone against the PTI and called it a “political terrorist.”

He targeted both the judiciary and the PTI, questioning the standard of justice set by the apex court’s judges for the opposition party and its founder.
“When they [judiciary] are seeing that the fresh elections are approaching, they are becoming overly politicised again,” he said.
“But this is my message: We have tolerated enough but we are not going to tolerate any rigging this time whether it is from the judiciary or the establishment. If the judiciary continues to show itself overly politicised, the PPP will reject such elections.
“And this time we won’t restrict ourselves to traditional protest. If justice is not served, we would snatch it. Be a judge, don’t be a politician.”
In over an hour-long furious speech, the PPP chairman referred to the series of events both at political and judicial fronts over the past few days and questioned the standard of trial against former prime minister, who was granted a blanket relief from courts that not only barred the authorities from arresting him but also stayed his trial in the Toshakhana case until the second week of June.
“Whether it is a judiciary or any other institution, it should not become the tiger force of Imran Khan,” he said.
“Then allow us as well. How would you [judiciary] react if we give a call to mark the April 4 [death anniversary of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto] rally inside the courtroom of the chief justice? What would you say if we decide to mark the next death anniversary of BB [Benazir Bhutto] Shaheed [on Dec 27] inside  Court No 1?”
G-20 Summit in held Kashmir
Towards the end of his address, the minister warned that India, which is planning to host the G-20 Summit in occupied Kashmir later this month, the country would violate international law, UN resolution, and bilateral and international agreements.
“If they [India] insist on hosting this summit in Srinagar defying all international laws, your foreign minister would be in Azad Kashmir among the people of Kashmir to counter their every lie and expose their false narrative and propaganda,” he said.

3,"Dr Yasmin Rashid arrested again, after LHC ordered her release","Due to her medical condition, police have decided to keep her at Services Hospital.","LAHORE: PTI’s Pun­jab chapter president Dr Yasmin Rashid was arrested again, just hours after the Lahore High Court had ordered her release along with 17 other women workers of the party detained under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO).
In a midnight development, Dr Yasmin was ‘arrested’ again, this time in cases registered at three different police stations of Lahore. However, due to her medical condition, the police decided to keep her at Services Hospital, where she had been taken from Kot Lakhpat jail after the court ordered her release.
On petitions challenging the detention of the PTI leaders and workers, Justice Safdar Saleem Shahid of the LHC had ordered release of the 18 women detained under the MPO, if not required in any criminal case.
Earlier, Advocate Sika­ndar Zulqarnain argued on behalf of the petitioners that the detained persons included responsible members of the bar and household women. He said they were neither active members of any political party nor invol­ved in any anti-state activities.
Additional Advocate General Ghulam Sarwar Nehang opposed the petitions and stated that the district government lawfully issued the detention orders of the persons involved in violent protests against the state.
He said the petitioners had not availed the first remedy in the law and directly moved the court. He pointed out that three of the detained women had already released due to a death in their family.
Advocate Ahmad Awais contended that Dr Yasmin was an elderly person and a cancer survivor.
The law officer said Dr Yasmin led the protest and provoked her party workers for violence. 
The judge suspended the impugned notificat­i­o­­ns issued under section 3 of MPO and ordered the government to release the remaining detained persons. He also sought rep­l­ies from the government on the petitions till May 22.
Earlier, the husband of PTI’s former lawmaker Alia Hamza filed a petition in the LHC, challenging the detention order of his wife issued by the government.
Petitioner Hamza Jamil Malik contended that the police barged into their house and abducted his wife on May 10. He said later the district government issued detention order of the PTI leader under MPO on May 11. He asked the court to set aside the detention order and direct the government to release her.

4,"Six troops, civilian martyred as clearance operation ends",Hostage families rescued; all attackers belonging to ‘Tehreek Jihad Pakistan’ killed,"QUETTA: A clearance operation that began when militants stormed an FC compound in Muslim Bagh town early on Friday morning completed on Saturday with all the six attackers eliminated and hostage families rescued.
The gunfight in Qila Saifullah district left six soldiers and a citizen martyred while another six people, including a woman, were injured (partly reported on Saturday). 
Arms and ammunitions, used by the militants belonging to a new outfit ‘Tehreek Jihad Pakis­tan’ in the attack, were seized.
During the hours-long shootout, the attackers slipped into the residential block and took some families of government employees and civilians hostage.

Hostage families rescued; all attackers belonging to ‘Tehreek Jihad Pakistan’ killed

Military’s media affairs wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), while confirming the incident, in a statement said that the complex clearance operation involved a rescue operation as well to save three families from a residential block. 
“The terrorists had not even spared children of their horrendous approach,” the ISPR said, adding that all six terrorists in the compound, who were well equipped, had been “sent to hell”. 
Necessary intelligence follow-up will continue to trace their linkages and arrest facilitators and expose their sponsors, it added.
Security forces, in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart all attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan, the ISPR said.
Corps Commander, others attend funeral
Funeral prayers for Naik Amin Ullah, 31, a resident of Kalat; Lance Naik Abdul Manaf, 35, a resident of Chakwal; and steno-typist Ghulam Fareed, 34, a resident of Sahiwal, who embraced shahadat while fighting gallantly against terrorists at the FC camp, were offered at Quetta Garrison.
Corps Commander Quetta and other serving and retired officers and soldiers and civilian officials attended the funeral prayers.
Last rites of other martyrs will be offered at their respective hometowns with full military honours.
Armed forces of Pakistan stand resolute against nefarious designs of the enemies of Pakistan, who are hell-bent on spoiling the hard-earned peace. These sacrifices will not go in vain and rather strengthen the army’s resolve to continue the fight against terrorism till its conclusion, the ISPR said.

5,Poliovirus found in another environmental sample from KP,Islamic Development Bank approves $100m for polio eradication from Pakistan.,"ISLAMABAD: While the Pakis­tan Polio Laboratory at the National Institute of Health confirmed the detection of wild poliovirus in an environmental sample from district South Waziristan of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Islamic Devel­opment Bank approved a financing contribution of $100 million, inclusive of a $35 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to the fourth phase of polio eradication project in Pakistan.
According to the Pakistan Polio Lab, the wild poliovirus Type-1, which was isolated from a sewage sample collected from Qureshi Mohalla in the district’s Wacha Khaura union council, was genetically linked to poliovirus found in sewage sample collected from the same district in September 2022.
Since three of the six positive samples detected in Pakistan this year belong to Afghanistan, officials believe there are 75pc chances of its spread from the neighbouring country where 22 environmental samples have been found positive, though both countries have reported one case each.
Talking to Dawn, National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) for Polio Eradication Coordinator Dr Shahzad Baig said: “As per genome sequencing three of six samples reported from Pakistan belonged to Afghan origin.” He believed there were only 25pc chances of local spread of virus in Pakistan, as there were 75pc chances the virus would spread from Afghanistan.

Islamic Development Bank approves $100m for polio eradication from Pakistan; immunisation drive in over 70 districts to begin tomorrow

Just a few days back, a four-year-old child has been infected with polio virus in Afghanistan due to which both countries have reported one each case of polio virus, he said.
Replying to a question, Mr Baig said the polio campaign was going to start in over 70 districts, except Quetta where it would be held after a few weeks, as currently security forces were busy in providing security for national games.
In a statement, federal Health Minister Abdul Qadir Patel said the detection of poliovirus in the environment was an indication that Pakistan’s polio surveillance system was working efficiently to locate virus circulation and take steps to prevent any further transmission. “Until we eradicate polio in Pakistan, the virus will continue to be a threat to children here and everywhere. Parents and caregivers, it is imperative that you understand the risk to your children and make sure that they receive polio drops in every campaign. This is the only way to ensure lifelong immunity for them,” he said.
He said polio drive was beginning in over 70 districts on May 15 and in southern KP on May 29, which was the perfect opportunity for parents to get their children vaccinated on their doorstep.
Dr Baig said that in the last stages of eradication, the virus could find refuge and thrive in under-immunised communities, which was why the seven endemic districts of southern KP were of high concern for the polio programme.
“Through intensive efforts after last year’s outbreak in southern KP, we have succeeded in containing the virus to this region. Here, the programme is maintaining a sharp focus on repeated quality campaigns, increased polio surveillance, increasing vaccine acceptance and improving overall routine immunisation rates,” he said.
Every month, the polio programme tests for poliovirus at 114 fixed environmental sites in Pakistan. To further enhance surveillance in high-risk areas, it has also been collecting additional sewage samples from multiple sites in southern KP periodically, and this latest detection is from one such collection site.
Since 2021, no human case has been reported outside the endemic southern KP region.
Dr Baig said this prompt detection would enable the programme to plan a swift response and protect children from paralytic polio. “This is the first positive environmental sample from Lower South Waziristan this year where the last human case was reported in August 2022. So far in 2023, one human case and six positive samples have been reported from Pakistan,” he said.
ISDB funding
Meanwhile, the Islamic Development Bank issued a press release following a meeting of its board of executive directors at Jeddah-based headquarters, stating that ISDB would finance the acquisition of most of the required oral polio vaccines through the provision of over 930 million doses of WHO-prequalified vaccines, which will be deployed for the 231.4m people in Pakistan by Unicef.
The meeting was part of the 2023 annual ISDB group meetings that opened on May 10.
It approved a financing contribution of $100 million, inclusive of a $35m grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to the fourth phase of polio eradication project in Pakistan. The project’s objective is to permanently contain the spread of all polioviruses, including wild poliovirus type-2 (cVDPV2) by the end of 2026, and maintain the Pakistan’s ‘polio-free’ status for the subsequent three years.
The project is being implemented by the ministry of national health services regulations and coordination.

6,AJK premier  calls on Dar second time  in a week,"Finance minister welcomes AJK premier, expresses govt's commitment to the development and progress of all regions.","ISLAMABAD: The newly appointed prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Anwarul Haq, met Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday for the second time in a week to reach an understanding over thorny issues, including the formation of a new cabinet.
The AJK government has struggled to manage its economic matters for the last year, with the previous administration blaming the PML-N-led federal government for depriving the region of its due funds.
Recently, a forward bloc of the PTI under Mr Haq’s leadership formed a new government in the AJK with support from the PDM lawmakers.
Since the change of government in AJK, the finance ministry at the Centre has released some Rs5 billion to the region as a development budget.
However, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif has directed his party in the AJK to refrain from supporting any amendments aimed at increasing the number of cabinet members, something Mr Haq demands.
A source said that since this development, Mr Haq had been desperate to garner support for the amendment to accommodate all legislative members from PML-N, PPP and PTI dissidents in the new cabinet.
Under the existing law, there could only be 16 ministers besides two advisers and two special assistants.
According to the source, Mr Dar had been tasked to finalise prospective cabinet members and discuss other issues with Mr Haq.
The PML-N also wants to bring its candidate as the AJK prime minister, another source said, adding that many prospective candidates were in the run for the slot.
An official announcement issued by the finance ministry on Saturday said that Mr Haq called on Mr Dar at the finance division. 
Mr Dar welcomed the AJK premier and expre­ssed the federal government’s commitment to the development and progress of all regions, including Azad Jammu and Kashmir.

7,Plea against Nikah of ex-PM dismissed as ‘inadmissible’,ISLAMABAD: A local court on Saturday dismissed a petition seeking action against PTI chairman Imran Khan for...,"ISLAMABAD: A local court on Saturday dismissed a petition seeking action against PTI chairman Imran Khan for reportedly marrying Bushra Bibi during the latter’s Iddat period.
Iddat is a 130-day waiting period, or a period of abstinence, after the dissolution of a woman’s marriage during which she is supposed to remain unmarried. 
Senior Civil Judge Nasrum Minallah dismissed the case because it fell outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court in Islamabad.
During the hearing, he questioned how a court in Islamabad could make a decision regarding an incident that took place in Lahore.
Mr Khan tied the knot with Bushra Bibi on January 1, 2018, in Lahore.
According to a witness named Aun Chaudhry, who was previously a close aide to Mr Khan but is currently serving as an Advisor to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the PTI chairman had informed him that the reason for marrying Bushra Bibi on the first day of 2018 was due to her forecast that Mr Khan would become the prime minister if they married on that specific day.
The court had previously reserved its decision on the maintainability of the petition on May 5.
When the court resumed the hearing, the petitioner’s counsel, Raja Rizwan Abbasi, argued that since the second Nikah ceremony of Mr Khan took place in Islamabad and the couple is also living here, therefore, the court can assume jurisdiction in this matter.
He argued that Mr Khan, driven by his anxiety to become the prime minister, disregarded the Iddat period and married Bushra Bibi.
He referred to this act as unlawful and contrary to the principles of Islam.
The judge noted that the Nikkah was solemnised in Lahore, therefore, it is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of an Islamabad court.
He stated that such a petition could only be filed within the territorial jurisdiction of Lahore.
Subsequently, he declared the petition as non-maintainable.
