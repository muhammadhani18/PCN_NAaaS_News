0,Business community fears ‘IMF-dictated’ budget to hit economy,Says Finance Minister Ishaq Dar has not held any meetings with industry leaders.,"KARACHI: Contrary to past practices, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar has not approached trade and industry leadership for taking their input for the upcoming budget to be unveiled on June 9.
As less than a month is left, business leaders have deplored that the PDM government has not invited them for any consultative sessions to incorporate their proposals in budget 2023-24, fuelling fears that it will be an IMF-dictated document which will further complicate the economic situation.
Site Association of Industry (SAI) president Riazuddin told Dawn that traditionally successive governments used to engage the business community in the budget-making process by holding consultative sessions with apex chambers, businessmen, industrialists, etc.
The Site chief recalled that in previous regimes, Mr Dar used to hold day-long deliberations with the trade and industry bodies by terming it a “grand finale” ahead of the budget announcement. “So far we have not been invited. We do not know whether the budget will be made on IMF dictation or the government is undertaking this exercise independently,” he observed.

Says Dar has not held any meetings with industry leaders

He told Dawn that the businessmen have also not seen any “budget strategy framework” which was previously shared by the governments almost four months ahead to review the outline of the budgetary measures.
Mr Riazuddin said the government has only asked the business community during February in writing to send their pre-budget proposals but no face-to-face discussions with Mr Dar and his team including the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman have so far been held.
While showing his concerns, Federation of Pakistan Cham­bers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President Irfan Iqbal Sheikh said the government has not yet started the consultative process with the business community in general and the apex body in particular.
He, however, invited Mr Dar to visit the FPCCI and meet the business leaders to take stock of their proposals vis-à-vis the upcoming federal budget and also listen to their issues, apprehensions and recommendations.
The apex chamber wants to present and discuss its proposals on industrial, trade, shipping and transportation, taxation, SME, agriculture, IT, monetary and fiscal policies with the government.  “Budget-making is the opportunity where we can have meaningful course correction based on ground realities, regional and global business environment and national interest,” he remarked.
Mr Irfan expressed his shock that IMF has resorted to arm-twisting as it has raised — for no reason — the external funding requirement from $6 billion to $8bn. “This is unfair and unethical and the international community must take notice,” he added.
He emphasised that the government’s economic and financial team must be crystal clear now that the IMF programme is not going to materialise before the upcoming budget.
He observed that the government was making its budget based on a resumed IMF programme but, given the fluid circumstances, it now has to make major adjustments in the budget within the short period of three weeks.
Mr Irfan maintained that the only solution that can steer Pak­istan out of the crisis is indigenous with few basic principles.
One is simplification and broadening of the tax base rather than squeezing the existing taxpayers and harassment of the business and industry and secondly, targeted subsidies to the five export-oriented sectors (i.e. textiles, IT, leather, sport and surgical goods) in electricity and gas tariffs, making it competitive through regionally competitive energy tariff (RCET) mechanism to manage exports earnings due to dearth of dollars.
The government should also encourage remittances by bridging the exchange rate gap between banking channels and open markets and protecting the assets of overseas Pakistanis.
“There is a need to incentivise industrialisation, export substitution and revival of sick units and make all economic policies in consultation with real stakeholders,” he stressed.
All political parties must sign a national economic agenda and plan for the next 15 years to ensure the continuity of economic policies and protect it from political meddling, he remarked.

1,Startup upskills IT graduates for global industry,"Dr Naqvi says a majority of Pakistan’s IT graduates are underemployed, not unemployable.","KARACHI: Pakistan hardly figures on the global IT map even though its universities churn out approximately 30,000 graduates a year in computer-related fields. Why?
One possible explanation is the widening gap between university education and the skillset that the globalised IT industry looks for in fresh graduates, according to Dr Sohail Naqvi, former vice-chancellor of the Lahore University of Management Sciences, who’s recently set up KnowlEDGE Streams, a startup to train IT graduates for the global IT industry.
The industry-academia gap is reflected in the performance of the dollar-earning IT industry. IT exports stayed flat on a year-on-year basis at $1.94 billion in the first nine months of 2022-23, according to data compiled by Topline Securities.
Dr Naqvi said his venture will help graduates upgrade their technical skillsets with respect to computer languages that are in high demand globally. But more importantly, it’ll help them learn soft skills like effective communications, teamwork and ethics.
In the beginning, he plans to hold 12-week boot camps in Lahore. Even though the objective is to create a social impact, he said the company will charge a fee to ensure that it can scale up operations in a sustainable manner.
The training fee is Rs90,000, payable in two instalments. Upon completion of the programme and successful employment, an additional Rs90,000 will become payable in three instalments over the next six months.
In other words, IT graduates are expected to cough up about 20pc of the total sum that they’ve already spent on getting their four-year bachelor’s degrees from second- and third-tier private universities to upskill themselves for the job market. What does it say about our university education system?
“The technical world is changing rapidly. Uni­versi­­ties focus on fundamentals while the boot camp is kind of a superstructure. A lot of universities don’t want to incorporate (in their curricula) many things that we teach in our boot camp,” he said.
Moreover, these boot camps will help science graduates pivot from one field to another, a more promising field. For example, they’ll help an electrical engineering graduate switch to cyber security or a math major transition into data sciences.
“As for the fee, we’ll sign income-sharing agree­ments to help graduates pay us from their future incomes in easy instalments.”
Dr Naqvi said a majority of Pakistan’s IT graduates are underemployed, not unemployable. “Their starting average salary is $2 an hour versus $70 an hour in advanced economies. Our IT graduates suffer because they lack confidence. They don’t know how to market themselves. They end up underselling themselves,” he said, adding that IT exports can jump 10 times in five years with the right kind of training.

2,"EU, US to pledge joint action over China concerns",They will also coordinate their export controls on “sensitive items” — including goods that have a military use — and semiconductors.,"BRUSSELS: Washing­ton and the EU will pledge joint action to tackle concerns focused on China about non-market practices and coordinate their export controls on semiconductors and other goods at a meeting this month, a draft statement showed.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Euro­pean Commission Vice-President Margrethe Ves­ta­­ger and other senior officials are due to meet for the fourth edition of the EU-US Trade and Te­chnology Council in Lulea, Sweden, on May 30-31.
The draft statement seen by Reuters said the two sides would address non-market practices and economic coercion, and aim to hold regular talks on efforts to stop their companies’ knowledge linked to outbound investment supporting technologies of strategic rivals — an oblique reference to China.
They will also coordinate their export controls on “sensitive items” — including goods that have a military use — and semiconductors, said the statement, which only mentions China twice and could still be changed before the meeting.
Brussels says it considers China a partner in some fields, an economic competitor and a strategic rival. The European Union plans to recalibrate its China policy, recognising coordination with a more hawkish US is essential.
Highlighting the medical devices sector in China, it said the transatlantic partners are  “exploring possible actions” over the threat posed by non-market policies and practices.

3,Stocks suffer losses in jittery week,Arif Habib Ltd says another reason for pessimism is the absence of Pakistan from the agenda of the IMF meetings.,"KARACHI: Trading on the stock exchange commenced on a negative note in the outgoing week as ratings agency Fitch stated that Pakistan faced a substantial debt payment of $3.7 billion in May and June.
Arif Habib Ltd said another reason for pessimism was the absence of Pakistan from the agenda of the International Mone­tary Fund (IMF) meetings, which dampened the hope for the resumption of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme.
Furthermore, there were significant political developments during the outgoing week that affected the investors’ sentiments. The arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan sparked protests across the country, leading to a period of political instability. However, as the week progressed, the political situation relatively eased off.
Foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) fell by $74 million to $4.38 billion. The rupee also depreciated against the dollar by 0.53 per cent on a weekly basis to close at 285.10.
As a result, the benchmark index of the stock market closed at 41,488 points, down 754 points or 1.8pc from the preceding week.
According to AKD Securities, a move towards political stability will dictate the market performance in the near term. “We continue to advocate companies that have dollar-denominated revenue streams, with minimal dollar-denominated cost structures, hedging them against any currency risk,” it added.

4,Govt asked to reimpose RD on luxury vehicles,"PAMA says govt has created an ""impossible situation that indirectly prevents the industry from progressing"".","ISLAMABAD: The auto industry has slammed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) for withdrawing the regulatory duty (RD) on the imports of luxury vehicles at a time when the country is facing a serious dollar crunch.
In a letter written to the Additional Secretary Revenue Division regarding termination of RD on March 31, Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA) Director General Abdul Waheed Khan expressed the fears that this move would facilitate some influential to bring in expensive vehicles through indirect channels.
“The government has created an impossible situation, that indirectly prevents the industry from progressing, while luxury items including CBU [completely built up] vehicles may continue to be imported at rather reduced taxes,” PAMA said.
“There are restrictions on opening of letters of credit, but those in the powerful circles can use other modes like making payment for the vehicles from any other country — possibly Dubai and importing the luxury cars or SUVs through the window when RD is not applicable,” he observed.
“At the same time the banks are allowing payments in dollars for import of vehicles,” Mr Waleed said while talking to Dawn and added that there were reports available to the industry players that after the termination of RD some influential were planning to import high-end vehicles.
He added that the local auto industry has already drawn the attention of the Federal Board of Revenue towards this issue and it will financially hurt the auto assembler as well as the vendors, and the RD has to be re-imposed at the earliest.

5,US company plans $200m pink salt facility,"Pakistan has huge reserves of pink salt with a potential earning of $12bn annually whereas currently, it's earning only $70m a year.","WASHINGTON: A leading American company plans to invest nearly $200 million in curating, processing, distributing, and importing pink Himalayan salt from Pakistan, officials said.
The Miracle Saltworks Collec­tive Inc (MSCI) conveyed its interest to the Ambassador of Pakistan Masood Khan at a meeting in Washington on Friday and shared their investment plans with him.
An embassy official told journalists that the company was willing to invest in the entire process — from mining to bringing it to the United States.
The company will also prepare feasibility and reserve reports and will upgrade mining procedures and processes. The plan includes the construction of a world-class processing and packaging facility at the mining site and community development programmes.
Pakistan has huge reserves of pink salt with a potential earning of $12 billion annually. An embassy press release said the country possesses approximately 22.22 billion tonnes of the natural resource, concentrated mostly in Salt Range areas of Kala Bagh, Warcha, Khewra and Bahadur Khel.
“The salt mines have an immense potential of kick-starting massive economic activity in the country,” the statement added.
The delegation included the company’s president and CEO Ahmed N. Khan, Vice President Mr. Tad M. Ballantyne, and members of its governing board.
Currently, Pakistan is earning only $70 million a year from this unique natural resource due to the lack of a policy framework and the absence of adequate facilities for processing, packaging and distribution.
Briefing the ambassador, President MSCI Ahmed N. Khan said that a multi-pronged solution, featuring public-private partnership under a clearly defined policy was being worked out to assist the government in enhancing pink salt exports.
The new policy would also encourage the private sector to take a lead role in exploiting the existing potential.
Company officials said that they were undertaking a joint venture with Pakistan Mineral Develop­ment Corporation and plan to raise market awareness to reach 10 million tonnes of verified extraction by 2030.
Two world-class processing and distribution facilities would be established in Doha and China to fulfil global demand for the product. Ambassador Masood Khan informed the team that the government was committed to providing every possible facilitation to international investors and business communities intending to invest in traditional and non-traditional sectors. Highlighting various steps taken for promoting ease of doing business and restoring investor confidence, the ambassador said that Pakistan had a unique geostrategic location and could serve as a vast market for Central and West Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.
He said that there was a huge market for pink salt not only in the region but across the world which guaranteed profitable business ventures in the sector.

6,G7 finance chiefs move to diversify supply chains,Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki says Covid had revealed “the downside of supply chains being too concentrated in one place”.,"NIIGATA: The G7 plans to launch a partnership scheme to diversify supply chains this year, the group’s finance ministers said on Saturday following talks in Japan ahead of a major summit next week.
The ministers did not directly cite a desire to reduce reliance on trade with China or Russia as motivation for the initiative, which focuses on clean energy technology.
But the United States has led a push for export controls on chip components to China, citing national security concerns, and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pointed to recent shocks to the global economy.
“Spillovers from Russia’s war against Ukraine and disruptions caused by the pandemic have made clear the importance of diversified and resilient supply chains,” she told reporters.
Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki also said Covid had revealed “the downside of supply chains being too concentrated in one place”.
In a joint statement, the Group of Seven’s finance ministers and central bank chiefs said they hoped to launch the partnership in collaboration with the World Bank “by the end of this year at the latest”.
The scheme, dubbed RISE — Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement — builds on guidance released in April, and will offer interested developing countries  “finance, knowledge and partnerships”.
How much will be spent on the programme has not been disclosed.
‘Stand ready’
The three-day meeting in the city of Niigata took place just days before the leaders of the group of major developed economies — which also includes France, Germany, Britain, Canada, Italy and the EU — gather in Hiroshima.
Support for Ukraine and the G7’s relationship with China is expected to be high on the agenda at the May 19-21 summit, along with nuclear disarmament and action on climate change.
As the finance talks wrapped up Saturday, the ministers reaffirmed their commitment to sanctions on Russia and said they were working together to enforce them, but did not announce any concrete new steps to tackle sanctions evasion.
“We, together with the international community, have increased our commitment of budget and economic support for Ukraine for 2023 and early 2024 to $44 billion,” their statement said.
The total amount has risen from a figure given by the G7 in February of $39bn for 2023.
They also stressed the need to bolster financial stability following recent banking sector turmoil, saying their governments  “stand ready to take appropriate actions”.
Three regional US banks have collapsed since early March, sparking panic among customers and upheaval for the shares of mid-sized institutions.
While vowing to  “address data, supervisory, and regulatory gaps in the banking system,” the finance chiefs nonetheless asserted that  “our financial system is resilient”.
The heads of the IMF, OECD and World Bank also attended the Niigata talks, along with finance ministers from Brazil, India and Indonesia.
Discussions were partly overshadowed by the US debt ceiling standoff, as the world’s largest economy faces its first-ever default.
The Congressional Budget Office said on Friday the nation could run out of money to pay its financial obligations by June 15 if lawmakers fail to agree on a deal to raise current limits on government spending.
