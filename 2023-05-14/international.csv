0,Final countdown: Thai parties make last-day pitch to voters,"BANGKOK: Thai opposition leaders toured Bangkok in open-top jeeps on Saturday in a final-day bid to woo voters,...","BANGKOK: Thai opposition leaders toured Bangkok in open-top jeeps on Saturday in a final-day bid to woo voters, urging them to turn out in force to oust the military-backed government.
The kingdom goes to the polls on Sunday with voters tipped to issue a damning verdict on former coup leader Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha after nearly a decade in power.
But in a country where coups and court rulings have often overturned election results, there are fears the military could seek to cling on — despite the army chief insisting there would be no intervention this time.
Pheu Thai’s main prime ministerial candidate Paetongtarn Shinawatra waved and made the traditional Thai  “wai” greeting to supporters as she toured the streets in an open-top jeep.
Dozens of trucks decked out in the party’s scarlet banners paraded from the Democracy Monument towards Bangkok’s main shopping district.
Supporters waved flags and chanted:  “Pheu Thai landslide.”  “I hope Thai people will vote for us to solve your problems,” Paetongtarn told reporters.
Despite giving birth to her second child less than two weeks ago, the 36-year-old showed no sign of flagging in the scorching tropical heat. “It’s only been 12 days, I’m a little bit tired but that’s OK,” she said.
“I’m so excited.” Pheu Thai has been leading opinion polls, but the party’s route to power could face roadblocks from a Senate handpicked by the military under the 2017 junta-scripted constitution.
Paetongtarn’s billionaire tycoon father Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted as prime minister by a military coup in 2006, while her aunt suffered the same fate at Prayut’s hands in 2014.
Young vs old 
Sunday’s poll is the first since major youth-led pro-democracy protests erupted across Bangkok in 2020 with demands to curb the power and spending of Thailand’s king — breaching a long-held taboo on questioning the monarchy.
Those protests fizzled out as Covid-19 curbs were imposed and dozens of leaders were arrested, but their energy has fed into growing support for the rival opposition Move Forward Party (MFP). MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat made his own push on an open-top truck tour Saturday, rallying support through a loudhailer.
“Please give the younger generation the opportunity to govern the country — we will take care of the older generation,” he told passersby.
The election has shaped up as a generational clash between the pro-democracy opposition, backed by young and rural voters, and the conservative, military-allied royalist establishment embodied by Prayut and his United Thai Nation party.
Prayut, 69, has made an unashamedly nationalist pitch for votes and painted himself as the only candidate capable of saving Thailand from chaos and ruin.
Also in the conservative camp is the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) led by deputy prime minister Prawit Wongsuwan — another former army chief and coup architect who was close to Prayut until they fell out.

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden said on Saturday that talks with Congress on raising the US government’s debt limit were moving along and more will be known about their progress in the next two days.
“I think they are moving along, hard to tell. We have not reached the crunch point yet,” Biden told reporters at Joint Base Andrews. “We’ll know more in the next two days,” he said.
Biden is expected to meet with Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders early next week to resume negotiations. The leaders had canceled a planned meeting on Friday to let staff continue discussions.
Aides for Biden and McCarthy have started to discuss ways to limit federal spending as talks on raising the government’s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling to avoid a catastrophic default creep forward,  Reuters has reported.
The Treasury Department says it could run out of money by June 1 unless lawmakers lift the nation’s debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Saturday called a showdown over raising the US debt  ceiling  “more difficult” than in the past but said she remained  hopeful a solution could be found to avert a first ever US default   Yellen said in an interview on the sidelines of a meeting of  Group of Seven finance officials in Japan that she hoped to update the  US Congress within the next couple of weeks about when exactly  Treasury would run out of funds to pay the government’s bills.

2,Surfer feared killed in shark attack,"Australia's Elliston, with a population of about 1,000, is known for its nearby rugged coastline and popular surfing spots.","SYDNEY: Rescuers were scouring the waters off a remote beach in South Australia on Saturday for traces of a surfer believed to have been killed in a shark attack.
Emergency services were called to the beach near the town of Elliston, about 650 km south of the state capital of Adelaide, following reports of the attack.
“A man is believed to have died following a shark attack at Walkers Rocks Beach,” police said in a statement, adding that the 46-year-old was the only person thought to have been attacked. A team was searching the area by boat, a state emergency services spokesperson said.
Elliston, with a population of about 1,000, is known for its nearby rugged coastline and popular surfing spots.
The attack follows the death in February of a girl mauled by a shark in a river in Perth, the capital of Western Australia.

3,"Alberta braces for more wildfires amid hot, dry weather","OTTAWA: Canada’s main oil-producing province of Alberta faces another hot and dry weekend, with warnings of more...","OTTAWA: Canada’s main oil-producing province of Alberta faces another hot and dry weekend, with warnings of more intense wildfires after blazes forced thousands to evacuate homes and temporarily shuttered energy production.
Authorities in at least one fire-ravaged area said on Saturday they had already seen an increase in fire activity and were expecting more. Residents forced to evacuate early this month say they are frustrated with the indefinite displacement. Special alerts have been declared across western Canada, and officials urged vigilance with temperatures in some areas forecast to hit 30 Celsius (86F), 10 to 15 degrees above normal.
“We are expecting hot and dry conditions in most of the province, which will make the wildfire danger climb,” Alberta Wildfire official Josee St-Onge told a briefing on Friday.
“We’re likely to see more intense wildfire activity this weekend and into early next week.”  More than 100 wildfires over the past 1-1/2 weeks forced about 30,000 people to leave home at one point. Oil and gas producers shut in at least 319,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or 3.7pc of national production. By Friday afternoon, 74 fires were burning across Alberta, 20 considered to be out of control, with about 16,500 evacuees.
Recent cooling and rain helped firefighters tackle some blazes and restored most of the energy production, but expectations of rising weekend temperatures have fanned worries.

4,Four Russian military aircraft shot down near Ukraine,MOSCOW: The Russian news outlet Kommersant reported that two Russian fighter jets and two military helicopters had...,"MOSCOW: The Russian news outlet Kommersant reported that two Russian fighter jets and two military helicopters had been shot down on Saturday close to the Ukrainian border, in what would be a spectacular coup for Kyiv if confirmed.
Kommersant, a respected, independent business-focused daily, said on its website that the Su-34 fighter-bomber, Su-35 fighter and two Mi-8 helicopters had made up a raiding party, and had been  “shot down almost simultaneously” in an ambush in the Bryansk region, adjoining northeast Ukraine.
“According to preliminary data ... the fighters were supposed to deliver a missile and bomb attack on targets in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine, and the helicopters were there to back them up — among other things to pick up the ‘Su’ crews if they were shot down.”  The Russian state news agency TASS said a Russian Su-34 warplane had crashed in that region but did not specify a cause.
TASS also cited an emergency services official as saying an engine fire in a helicopter had caused it to crash near Klintsy, which is about 40 km from the border.
It made no mention of the Su-35, or of a second helicopter. However, a video posted on the Russian pro-war Telegram channel Voyenniy Osvedomitel, which has about half a million followers, showed a helicopter high in the sky suffering an explosion, being thrown off course and then plunging towards the ground in flames.
Comments accompanying the video, which this news agency could not immediately verify, said it showed a Mi-8 being shot down by a missile. Other images posted by the channel showed wreckage in an agricultural field.
Kommersant provided no evidence for its report that four aircraft had been downed, but the same assertion was also made by several heavily followed pro-war military bloggers. The Moscow Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Voyenniy Osvedomitel said it appeared that  “most likely, the enemy staged an ambush with air defences previously transferred to a border zone close enough to hit our group”.
It said the downed helicopters appeared to be Mi-8MTPR-1 electronic warfare craft able to jam enemy radio and targeting signals. Kommersant said all four crews had been killed.
There was no official response from Ukraine, which usually declines to comment on reports of attacks inside Russia.
However, in a tweet, Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukr­ainian President Volodymyr Zele­nsky, called the incident  “Justice ... and instant karma”.

6,Syria extends humanitarian aid access via two border crossings,"Following international pressure, Damascus agrees to let the UN use the Bab al-Salama and Al-Rai crossings.","UNITED NATIONS: Syria has extended for three months humanitarian aid access into quake-stricken rebel-held areas from Turkiye via two border crossings, a United Nations representative said on Saturday.
The Syrian foreign minister conveyed the decision  “to allow the UN to continue using the Al Ra’ee and Bab Al-Salam crossings for an additional three months,” Eri Kaneko, spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said in a statement. There was no immediate comment from Damascus.
Syrians affected by the Feb 6 earthquake that killed more than 55,000 people in Syria and Turkiye have been relying on the two border crossings for vital humanitarian deliveries.
Following international pressure, Damascus agreed to let the UN use the Bab al-Salama and Al-Rai crossings, operated by Turkish-backed rebels, to bring in food and medical supplies for three months.
The permission had been set to expire May 13, so Syria’s decision was welcome news for those affected as well as for human rights organisations, which had urged the UN to continue deliveries even absent re-authorisation from Damascus.

“It is a great honour,” Zelensky told Pope Francis, putting his hand to his heart and bowing his head as he greeted the 86-year-old pope, who stood with a cane.
Earlier on Saturday, Zelensky met Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who promised full military and financial backing for Ukraine and reiterated support for its EU membership bid.
Zelensky, who was visiting Rome for the first time since the war began, spoke with the pope for 40 minutes and presented him with a bulletproof vest that had been used by a Ukrainian soldier and later painted with an image of the Madonna.
A Vatican statement said that in their private talks, Zelensky and the pope discussed  “humanitarian gestures”, which a Vatican source said was a reference to the Vatican’s willingness to help with the repatriation of Ukrainian children.
Kyiv estimates nearly 19,500 children have been taken to Russia or Russian-occupied Crimea since February 2022, in what it condemns as illegal deportations.

8,Sudan talks to resume in Saudi Arabia amid heavy fighting,KHARTOUM: Khar­toum residents described fierce battles on Saturday with fighters roving the streets and little sign...,"KHARTOUM: Khar­toum residents described fierce battles on Saturday with fighters roving the streets and little sign Sudan’s warring sides were respecting an agreement to protect civilians ahead of ceasefire talks due to resume in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.
Fighting has rocked Khartoum and adjoining areas as well as Geneina in the Darfur region since the warring army and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary force agreed a  “declaration of principles” on Thursday.
“It was much worse this morning compared to the past two days. You could clearly hear the tanks and the RSF were patrolling the streets more than usual,” said Hani Ahmed, 28.
The conflict that broke out a month ago has killed hundreds of people, sent more than 200,000 into neighbouring states, displaced another 700,000 inside the country, and risks drawing in outside powers and destabilising the region.
Medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres said displaced people living in a large camp in north Darfur were cutting down to a single meal a day because food aid programmes had been halted by fighting. It said the condition of already malnourished children would likely deteriorate. Airspace will stay closed except for aid flights until May 31, authorities said on Saturday.
The two sides have battled through previous truces and have shown no sign of being willing to compromise. Although the RSF promised to uphold Thursday’s agreement, the army has not yet commented on it.
Neither side seems able to secure a quick victory, with the army able to call on air power but the RSF dug into residential districts throughout the capital.
“We only see the army in the sky but in terms of face-to-face contact we only see the RSF. They’re the ones on the ground,” Ahmed said.
For civilians the conflict has unleashed a nightmare of bombardment, random gunfire, home invasions and looting, amid flickering electricity supply, shortages of water and food, and little chance of medical help with injuries.
“Our neighbourhood is now completely under RSF control, They loot and harass people and wander around, always armed, taking shelter wherever they want,” said Duaa Tariq, 30, an art curator in Khartoum.
Tariq said she hoped the talks in Jeddah could lead to a ceasefire, but was doubtful, adding:  “We can’t really trust either side because they don’t have control of their soldiers on the ground”.
Fighting is unabated since the two sides agreed the declaration of principles to protect civilians and allow humanitarian access.
Residents say RSF fighters continue to occupy properties, which the force has denied doing, and the army carries out air strikes that residents say hit civilian targets.
Hashim Mohamed, 35, said he had found bread in a local shop for the first time in a week.  “It’s not that bread isn’t available, but it’s a longer walk which means more brushes with danger,” he said. Out shopping on Saturday, he had to duck down as gunfire 
rattled nearby and RSF fighters cruised the neighbourhood in civilian cars.
The resumed talks in Jeddah will start by discussing ways to implement the existing agreement, then move on to a lasting ceasefire that could pave the way for a civilian government, officials say.

Lori Vallow

 
LOS ANGELES: A US mother with  “doomsday” religious beliefs was found guilty on Friday of murdering two of her children and conspiring to kill her husband’s ex-wife.
Lori Vallow was on trial in the northwestern US state of Idaho over the deaths of her 16-year-old daughter Tylee Ryan and adopted seven-year-old son Joshua  “JJ” Vallow.
Her fifth husband Chad Daybell — the self-published author of several apocalyptic novels — will soon go on trial separately over similar charges, which also include the murder of his first wife, Tammy.
The couple’s  “religious beliefs” were cited by prosecutors as a factor in the murders, and their story was the subject of a Netflix true-crime documentary series  “Sins of Our Mother,” released last year.
The case first drew national headlines in late 2019 following the disappearance of Vallow’s children, which was first reported to authorities by Joshua’s grandparents.
The police inquiry quickly took a macabre turn as it emerged that several people associated with Vallow and Daybell had died in recent years, and she was arrested in Hawaii months later.
Vallow’s third husband, Joseph Ryan — Tylee’s father — had died in 2018 of a heart attack. She was in the process of divorcing her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, when he was killed by a gunshot, fired by her now-deceased brother, in July 2019. In October 2019, Daybell’s wife Tammy died ostensibly of natural causes.
Vallow and Daybell moved to Hawaii a few weeks later, where they married.
Vallow and Daybell never reported that the children were missing, and their bodies were found in June 2020 on property owned by Daybell in Idaho.

10,Israel and Islamic Jihad agree Gaza truce,"GAZA: Israel and the militant Islamic Jihad movement in Gaza have agreed a truce, Palestinian officials said,...","

GAZA: Israel and the militant Islamic Jihad movement in Gaza have agreed a truce, Palestinian officials said, signalling an end to the worst episode of cross-border fire since a 10-day war in 2021.
Egypt, which brokered the ceasefire, called on all sides to adhere to the agreement, Egypt’s Al-Qahera News television channel reported.
“In the light of the agreement of the Palestinian and the Israeli side, Egypt announces a ceasefire between the Palestinian and the Israeli side has been reached,” a text of the agreement said, and added the truce would begin at 10pm.
“The two sides will abide by the ceasefire which will include an end to targeting civilians, house demolition, an end to targeting individuals immediately when the ceasefire goes into effect,” it said. There was no immediate confirmation from Israeli officials.
Even as the truce was being finalised, the two sides kept up firing, with warning sirens sounding in southern Israel and Israel’s military announcing it had hit six operational command posts of Islamic Jihad.
Israel launched the latest round of airstrikes in the early hours of Tuesday, announcing that it was targeting Islamic Jihad commanders who had planned attacks in Israel.
In response, the Iranian-backed group fired hundreds of rockets, sending one and a half million Israelis into air raid shelters.
During the five days of the campaign, Israel killed six senior Islamic Jihad commanders and destroyed a number of military installations but the airstrikes also killed at least 10 civilians, including women and children.
From dawn, Gaza fighters fired  rockets, setting off sirens and sending Israelis across the border  running to bomb shelters. A Palestinian labourer from Gaza who was working in Israel was killed by rocket shrapnel, a hospital spokesperson said. 
The Israeli military said aircraft struck Islamic Jihad command centres and rocket launchers in Gaza. Huge clouds of smoke rose as loud explosions ripped through areas bombed. 
In the Deir Al-Balah area of the central Gaza  Strip, a building was flattened as houses nearby were knocked down.  There were no reports of casualties as residents sifted through piles of  rubble. 
Air strikes on a house also damaged the nearby Shuhada Al-Aqsa  hospital, wounding a number of nurses and patients with flying shrapnel,  Eyad Abu Zaher, the hospital’s director, said. 
Israel’s military says it has made every effort to limit civilian  casualties and damage to houses and accuses Islamic Jihad of  deliberately locating its command centres in residential areas.
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh  called on the United Nations to intervene as violence spilled over to  the occupied West Bank. 
Two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli raid on the outskirts of  Nablus in the northern West Bank, where clashes had erupted, the  Palestinian Health Ministry said. A military spokesman said gunmen  exchanged fire with Israeli forces. 
Hours later a Palestinian man, whom Israeli police said ran towards officers with a knife in his hand, was shot dead.

11,Temperature in Singapore soars to 40-year high,Vietnam reported a record temperature of 44.1 degrees Celsius last week.,"SINGAPORE: Singapore reported its highest temperature in 40 years on Saturday, officials said, as a blistering heatwave burns through large parts of South and Southeast Asia.
Saturday’s temperature of 37 degrees Celsius was the highest this year, and matches the record for a daily peak recorded in April 1983, the National Environment Agency said on Facebook.

“The current warm and dry conditions are expe­cted to continue tomorrow,” the agency said on Saturday. “Short-duration showers are expected next week which may help to moderate the warm temperatures,” it added.
May is normally one of the warmest months of the year, according to the NEA. Some schools in the city-state have relaxed rules on uniforms over the rising mercury in recent days, according to local broadcaster Channel News Asia.
Vietnam reported a record temperature of 44.1 degrees Celsius last week, with its state electricity company warning that the national power system would come under strain this summer due to anticipated heatwaves.
