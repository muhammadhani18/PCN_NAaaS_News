2,Scientific management of KP forests begins after delay of three decades,"Official says initiative must for sustainable production of timber, firewood.","PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa forestry and wildlife department’s plans to manage forests in the province along scientific lines have got off the ground after remaining on the back-burner for three decades.
Officials told Dawn that as the first task under the scientific forest management project, the department would clear the “dead, dying, diseased or wind-felled” trees from forests in the province.
They said the department didn’t regularly remove such trees fearing that social media would promote wrong impressions about the exercise.
The officials said some social media users even showed the “legitimate felling of trees as the handiwork of timber mafia.”

Official says initiative must for sustainable production of timber, firewood

“As per the working plan estimates, the annual commercial yield from the forests of Hazara and Malakand areas is 11.5 million cubic feet with a minimum price of Rs17 billion annually,” conservator (forest) in the lower Hazara division Mohammad Yousaf Khan told Dawn.
He said on average, 70 per cent of the money went to people as forest royalties and the rest to the government.
“We are implementing this initiative under the approved working plan separately chalked out for each forest in the province,” he said.
The official said KP’s annual forest-related losses since 1993 totalled Rs17 billion.
He said scientific forest management was necessary for sustainable production of timber, firewood and other minor forest production, while it was also important for the better health and hygiene of the forest to reduce the fire hazards and flood disasters.
The conservator said initially, the scientific management of forests was banned in 1993 as two years were required to enhance the capacity of the forest department personnel as well as organisational structure and mechanised harvesting.
He, however, said the ban was extended to 22 years and stayed in place until 2015 due to the “pressure” from organisations working against deforestation in the country.
“With this harvesting of such timber will not only improve the health and hygiene of the forest but will also enhance its production,” he said.
About the implementation of scientific forest management, the official said the department would remove dead, dying and diseased trees before starting the thinning of the dense trees to provide them space and open it for better growth.
He said matured and over matured trees would be removed as per yield of the forest.
“The dead, dying and diseased trees have caused fire hazard that wasevident from the enhanced fire phenomena since 1992. They also spread diseases in healthy trees by providing nourishment to pests and fungi,” he said.
The official said the province produced the best quality timber in the world, including deodar, kail, fir/spruce and chir, which all were softwood timber of pine species.
He added that KP produced quality timber of hardwood species, including shisham, walnut, oak and ash (sum).
“By not implementing the scientific forest management project since 1993, 11.5 million cubic feet of timber has been dying in the forest every year. That rots at the same rate. Currently, we can extract 55 million cubic feet of timber in the category of dead and dying trees,” he said.
The official said only in the Malakand region, 80 forests were mature and over mature and they were located at Badgoi area of Upper Dir district, Ursoon, Urandoo and Kalash areas of Chitral district, and Gornai area of Swat district.
He said the old and aged forest was also located in Gantar forest of Battagram, Bata Kundi forest of Mansehra and Donga Gali and Tandyani forest of Abbottabad.
“The economic life of deodar, kail and deodar is 100 years and that of shisham and chir 60 years. However, the majority of Deodar, Kail and Fur in our forest is more than 200-year-old and chir and shisham over 100-year-old. Tree mortality rate in our forests is extraordinarily higher than the normal mortality,” he said.

4,PHC orders Nadra to unblock identity card of transgender person,"Rules people have rights regardless of their gender identity; says to bring about complete paradigm shift, law has to play a more predominant role.","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has ordered the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to unblock Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) of a transgender person.
The court observed that a transgender had the right to freedom of expression and opinion regardless of his sexual orientation or gender identity.
A bench consisting of PHC Chief Justice Musarrat Hilali and Justice Shakeel Ahmad accepted a petition filed by a transgender person Shah Fahad alias Katrina against blocking of his CNIC on the orders of an additional district and sessions judge issued on March 4, 2019 and April 19, 2019.
The petitioner was fraudulently mentioned as surety for accused persons in two criminal cases when they were released on bail. When the accused started absconding, the court had issued non-bailable arrest warrants of the petitioner with the direction to Nadra to block his CNIC.

Rules people have rights regardless of their sexual orientation

Advocate Umair Iqbal appeared for the petitioner and said that traumatic experiences were faced by members of the transgender community. He argued that every member of that community including the petitioner had legal rights to be treated in accordance with law in terms of Article 4 of the Constitution and to espouse and determine their identity.
He said that since transgender persons were neither treated as male or female, nor given the status of third gender, they were being deprived of many rights and privileges, which other persons were enjoying as citizens of the country.
About the case of his client, the counsel stated that in a narcotics case in 2014 bail was granted to a woman accused and in her surety bonds the name of the petitioner was mentioned by someone and thus he was shown as one of the sureties. Subsequently, during inquiry, the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) found the signature of the petitioner on the surety bonds as forged and he was absolved of the liability as surety by the court.
However, the petitioner was shocked when he learnt about two FIRs wherein he was shown as surety of two other accused persons, who had been absconding, and the additional sessions judge had ordered blocking his CNIC through the two impugned orders.
Setting aside the impugned orders, the bench directed the presiding officers of subordinate courts across the province that before attesting the bail bonds/surety bonds they must inquire about the identity of the sureties and Nadra should provide facility of biometric system in the courts of judicial magistrates, sessions judges, additional sessions judges and judges of the special courts for comparison of signatures/thumb impressions of the sureties.
The bench observed that the petition exposed the prevalence of gender inequality in the society, which compelled one to contemplate whether fundamental conception of gender empowerment and gender justice was actualised despite a number of legislations, judicial pronouncements and progressive outlook in the society.
“We noted and observe that seldom, our society realises or cares to realise the trauma, agony, pain and humiliation, which the members of the transgender community undergo, nor appreciate the innate feelings of the members of the transgender community, especially those whose mind and body disown their biological sex,” the bench observed.
“Our society often ridicules and abuses the transgender community at public places like railway stations, bus stands, workplaces, mall, schools, hospitals, theatres, etc. They are sidelined and treated like untouchables, forgetting the fact that the moral failure lies in society’s unwillingness to accept them as human beings or embrace different gender identities and expressions, a mindset which we have to change,” the bench observed.
The court also referred to different international conventions observing that Article 6 of the Universal declaration of Human Rights 1948 and Article 16 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 recognised that every human being had the inherent right to live and the right should be protected by law and no one should be arbitrarily deprived of that right.
“When we discuss about the rights of transgender persons in the constitutional context and perspective, we find that in order to bring about complete paradigm shift, law has to play more predominant role,” the bench maintained.
The bench said that treating a transgender person differently was the denial of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizens of Pakistan. “It is the denial of social justice, which in turn has the effect of denying political and economic justice,” it added.

SQC founding members Mir Alam, Said Shah and Zahid Afridi told Dawn that their tribe had been at loggerheads with various villages of Peshawar, situated on about 14 kilometres stretch from Hayatabad to Ourmarrh Nehar, over the demarcation of boundary for the last four decades.
Mir Alam said that rival tribes on both sides of the disputed boundary had established trenches and also exchanged fire on a number of occasions that caused injuries to several people in recent past.
He said that rival groups had also resorted to looting of shops and public properties besides torching some vehicles with no group willing to budge from its respective claim on the disputed land.
Mir Alam said that a series of talks was held with elders from Peshawar villages after the formation SQC and after lengthy deliberations, the issue was resolved with the help of a boundary demarcation agreement the Shalobar tribe had signed with its rivals when Arbab Mohammad Jahangir was chief minister of the province.
He said that the council was also working on resolution of local disputes, mostly land and monetary issues while a fund was set up to provide free education to at least 400 poor students of the tribe alongside distributing relief goods among orphans and needy families during and after Ramazan.

He said that the educated members of their council were providing necessary counselling to those, who were involved in different types of litigations.
He said that efforts were also under way to raise literacy rate in the area by enrolling maximum number of out of school children in educational institutions.
