The crackdown has been initiated following the orders of the federal interior minister.
According to an FIA spokesperson, teams conducted raids in Bannu, Kohat and Dera Ismail Khan, detected electricity theft and took Syed Rehman, Khalid Mahmood, Muhammad Yasin, Waqas Mahmood, Waheedullah and Muhammad Imtiaz into custody.
These individuals were illegally stealing electricity for their shops, schools, clinics, and offices by using Kunda (direct hooking) from the main power line.
Aided by the FIA officials, the Peshawar Electric Supply Company (PESCO) officials promptly disconnected the illicit connections and confiscated the cables and other equipment utilised for the illegal provision of electricity. The national exchequer had been incurring significant financial losses due to electricity theft.
Officials also seized counterfeit medicines and injections from three medical stores and handed over samples to the officials of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) authorities. Further legal action will be taken against medical store owners in light of the DRAP’s report.
The FIA has constituted special raiding teams in all circles to crack down on electricity thieves and sellers of counterfeit medicines.

2,Rawalpindi hospital treats 400 child eye cancer cases,Alarming rise in eye cancer in children across the country raises eyebrows,"While cases of eye cancer in children are increasing in the country as compared to other countries in the region, a trust hospital has recently treated 400 child patients successfully in a single year.
Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital has recorded a staggering 400 cases of eye cancer in children within a single year. Approximately 30% of eye patients in the country are children.
Medical experts say a delay in treatment may result in permanent vision loss. Timely treatment is crucial to preserving the child's vision, as untreated cases may result in loss of sight or even prove fatal. The treatment process for eye cancer is lengthy and costly, with patients requiring regular examinations every six months post-chemotherapy, and some patients are checked for up to 7 years.
Upon detection of eye cancer in children, the Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital administration took an immediate step to set up emergency and outpatient departments (OPD), followed by the establishment of a dedicated ward and the provision of chemotherapy services.
Dr Tanzeela Farah, a specialist in treating children's vision at the hospital, says as many as 400 cases of eye cancer were registered in the last year with a 100% success ratio. Each step of the treatment process, including diagnosis and chemotherapy, is conducted under one roof, she adds.
Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital president Major General (Retired) Rahmat Khan says children have been undergoing treatment for eye cancer for three years. Initially, surgery was performed, but unfortunately, cancer would reappear after two or three years, he said and added that subsequently, the hospital introduced a chemotherapy facility following the surgery. “Afterwards, the necessity for radiotherapy arose, marking a crucial turning point. It was one of the most expensive projects with huge expenditures.”
Rehmat said that as the radiotherapy service was exclusively available at Noori Hospital Islamabad and CMH Rawalpindi, Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with CMH Hospital, aiming to offer complimentary radiotherapy services to ailing children. “The entire cost is covered by Al-Shifa hospital. We also offer complete treatment facilities without any charge to children who are battling eye cancer,” he maintained.
Medical experts related to the treatment of cancer in children's eyes are of the view that the spread of eye cancer in children could only be addressed through timely intervention. Delay in seeking treatment could lead to irreversible vision impairment in affected children.
They strongly advise parents to promptly consult a doctor upon observing any signs of vision problems in their children to safeguard their eyesight from any potential harm.

3,New education policy ‘hinders’ literacy,Cutting down on admission quotas may prove detrimental to school-aged children,"The Provincial Education Department has formally issued a notification announcing the commencement of the new academic year, session 2024-25, from April 1 for all government schools.
Simultaneously, an ‘inflation bomb’ has been dropped on the parents of students as a new admission policy has been introduced, which has restricted admissions for a significant number of students in government schools.
The Education Department has directed that only 4 per cent of new students from class one to class nine should be admitted in all government schools this year.
Additionally, the supply of free textbooks in government schools, a long-standing incentive for students, will be curtailed as the education department has ordered the establishment of a textbook bank in every government school.
Under this policy, old textbooks will be collected from graduated students and redistributed free of charge to new students. This leads to concerns about the availability of complete textbooks and its impact on the teaching system.
With around students of 47,000 government schools being affected by the new policy, even the teachers’ organisations have rejected it, terming it as detrimental to education.
The Central Secretary General of Punjab Teachers Union, Rana Liaquat, has expressed concern over the reduction in new admissions this year, citing potential implications for out-of-school street children, which have increased to more than 27 million in Punjab.
The Central Secretary of Punjab SES Teachers Association, Muhammad Shafiq Bhalwalia, confirmed the notification to start the new academic session from April 1 and acknowledged difficulties in receiving old books from students.
Meanwhile, annual examinations from class one to eight have been completed in all government schools, with results set to be announced on Monday, March 31. The new academic year will commence from April 1.
New admissions for classes one to eight have started in government schools this week The admissions phase has been divided into two phases: running from March 20 to May 31 and then from August 15 to October 31.
The expected decline in admissions, the end of free books, and the potential increase in fees may lead to a deterioration in the teaching system of government schools from April 1, prompting parents to consider alternatives such as small private schools due to rising living costs.

4,Transfer of academics draws criticism,Casts doubt on the process of reshuffles within FDE colleges,"The recent transfers of senior academics within the colleges running under the Federal Directorate of Education have drawn widespread criticism from various quarters.
According to a notification, the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) has recently reshuffled many principals and associate professors. One such case involves Shabana Tabasum, a professor at Islamabad Model College for Girls (IMCG) F-7/2, who was ‘inexplicably’ transferred to IMCG (PG) F-7/4, only to be assigned temporary duty back at her original institution, IMCG (PG) F-7/2.
The transfer raised serious questions about the decision-making process within the FDE.
An official questioned the transfer a professor to a different institution, only to have them perform duties back at their previous place of posting?
“It's a textbook example of bureaucratic absurdity that serves no purpose other than to confuse and inconvenience professors,” he said. Adding to the confusion is the case of Rozina Fahim, originally stationed at IMCG (PG) G-10/4 but temporarily serving as Principal at the Federal Government College of Home Economics & Management Sciences F-11/1.
She has now been transferred to fill the vacant post left by Tabasum at IMCG (PG) F-7/4, while continuing her temporary duty at the FGCHE&MS, F-11/1. The domino effect continues as Sadia Ibrar, previously posted at IMCG (PG) F-7/4, finds herself relocated to IMCG (PG) G-10/4 to accommodate a junior associate professor as principal.
Such decisions have raised eyebrows and drawn criticism from within the academic community, casting doubts on the competence of those orchestrating these transfers. Meanwhile, Shazia Wazir, serving as Principal at IMCG I-14/3, was transferred to IMCG Bhara Kahu to assume the role of Principal. Najm-un-Nisa, the incumbent Principal at IMCG Bhara Kahu, finds herself at the center of yet another confounding transfer. Despite being transferred to IMCG (PG) F-7/2, Najm-un-Nisa is expected to perform temporary duty as Principal at IMCG I-8/3. Abida Parveen, an associate professor at IMCG (PG) G-10/4, has been transferred on temporary duty to IMCG I-14/3.
She will perform temporary duty as Principal. An associate professor told APP that this convoluted chain of transfers not only highlights the lack of rational decision-making but also exposes the misuse of the concept of ""temporary duty.”
She further said, ""This phenomenon of temporary duty is not recognised in government rules. This ""temporary duty"" syndrome is severely detrimental to the functioning of educational institutions. Professors and principals find themselves divided between multiple colleges, receiving salaries from one while performing duties at another.
This not only disrupts the educational environment but also compromises the quality of teaching and administration, she added. According to some teachers, these illogical transfers and the prevalence of temporary duty to the absence of a regular Director General leading the Federal Directorate of Education. The lack of decisive leadership has resulted in haphazard decision-making, ultimately undermining the educational system's integrity and efficiency.

6,Discussants pore over Pakistan’s energy crisis,Express concerns about delays in interstate gas pipeline projects,"Experts expressed serious concerns about delays in the interstate gas pipeline projects during a webinar, highlighting the significant challenges these delays pose to the country.
They emphasised that these delays not only hinder Pakistan's efforts to tackle its energy crisis but also fail to meet the increasing demand for natural gas. Consequently, this leads to energy shortages and economic instability.
Moreover, the experts pointed out that the prolonged non-implementation of these projects also hampers regional cooperation and may strain diplomatic relations with partner countries, impacting Pakistan's international standing. “The uncertainty surrounding these projects further creates investment risks, discouraging foreign investors and impeding economic growth and development.”
The webinar, titled ""Interstate Gas Pipeline Projects: Challenges and the Way Forward to Meet Pakistan's Energy Crisis,"" was organised by the Devcom-Pakistan Centre for Geopolitical Studies. The panel of experts included Qaiser Aijaz, an environment and energy consultant, Munir Ahmed, the Executive Director of Devcom-Pakistan, Dr Zainab Ahmed from Lahore Garrison University, and Dr Khushboo Ejaz from Kinnaired College for Women.
During the webinar, Qaiser Aijaz highlighted the current geopolitical complexities, including domestic political instability, recent general elections, and global conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts. These factors, coupled with tensions at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, make immediate progress on interstate gas pipeline projects challenging.
Aijaz emphasised the need for a detailed review of project parameters like engineering designs, costs, and economic viability to ensure smooth project implementation.
Munir Ahmed expressed concern over Pakistan's failure to advance these projects, noting that it has raised national and international apprehensions. He mentioned Iran's intention to take Pakistan to the International Court of Justice for a penalty related to the gas pipeline project and highlighted the stalled progress of the TAPI pipeline despite feasibility studies. Ahmed criticised Pakistan's foreign policy and energy diplomacy, calling for urgent foreign investments to address the energy crisis effectively.
Dr Khushboo Ejaz discussed the intricate political economy surrounding pipeline projects, emphasizing the challenges posed by politics, economics, and energy dynamics. She cited examples like the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline, facing international sanctions and opposition, and the TAPI pipeline, which struggles with security threats and regional disagreements.
Dr Zainab Ahmed focused on the shifting geopolitics towards geoeconomics, particularly in the context of energy reliance and regional cooperation. She highlighted Pakistan's urgent need for affordable energy sources amid economic challenges and the complexities of dealing with US sanctions on projects like the Iran-Pakistan pipeline. Ahmed also mentioned the rivalry between the US and China, which further complicates regional cooperation efforts.
