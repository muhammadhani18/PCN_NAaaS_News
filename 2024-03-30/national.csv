0,Online shopping boosts e-business,"Experts say transparent policies, secure payment gateways drive growth","IT business consultants and market gurus have noted a significant uptick in e-store businesses, attributing it to the growing trend of online shopping. They highlight that consumers are increasingly drawn to the convenience of purchasing products from the comfort of their homes, saving time and transportation costs, and avoiding the urban hustle and bustle.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, these experts underscored the resilience of online sales figures, which underscore the strong demand for products and services in the market.
They stated that establishing a popular and reliable e-store in a market with varying levels of digital literacy and awareness takes time and strategic efforts. E-stores have invested resources in strategic marketing campaigns, user education, and continuous platform improvements over the years to earn the trust and loyalty of local customers.
Prioritising transparency, integrity, and customer-centricity in all operations can further enhance public trust. Transparent policies, accurate product descriptions, secure payment gateways, and responsive customer support have played key roles in fostering trust and confidence among customers.
Local online supermarkets such as foodpanda, Daraz, Krave Mart, and e-services of Imtiaz, Naheed, and other supermarkets are experiencing consistent growth in online shoppers. Additionally, international online supermarkets like Amazon, JD, Walmart, and others are also expanding their networks among their respective customers.
IT Expert Mehboob Shar, also Founder and CEO of Icreativez Technologies, highlighted that the trend of e-stores was gradually rising worldwide before the sudden spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. He noted that disseminating awareness about e-supermarkets in Pakistan would have taken 10 to 15 years under normal circumstances. However, the pandemic accelerated the adoption of online shopping as people sought to contain the virus in their respective areas. Following the pandemic, e-shopping gained momentum and is now experiencing substantial growth.

“Allow me to share my own experience as the CEO of an IT company. We’ve seen a twentyfold increase in e-store projects globally, as businesses seek our expertise in developing or modernising websites and apps, as well as providing solutions to challenges faced by e-store owners and their customers,” he said. “Their sales are on the rise, prompting a demand for website modernisation to enhance customer experience and provide additional facilities,” he added.
Syed Taha Magrabi, Director of Q-Commerce at foodpanda Pakistan, underscored that online supermarkets offer unparalleled convenience, extensive variety, and seamless accessibility to consumers. With the ability to browse and purchase a wide range of products from the comfort of their homes, shoppers are increasingly drawn towards the convenience and efficiency that e-marts provide.
“Our platform has experienced a steady rise in consumer engagement, with an increasing number of users joining us monthly and annually. Since 2023, our annual user base has seen double-digit growth, indicating the growing preference for online shopping among consumers,” he stated.
“As part of our commitment to enhancing the online shopping experience, we continuously explore new initiatives to benefit our valued consumers. This includes expanding our product categories to cater to diverse preferences and implementing customer-centric policies to ensure a seamless shopping journey,” he added.
IT Analyst Mohammad Yasir noted that e-shopping stores experienced remarkable growth during the Covid-19 pandemic. Both e-commerce marketplaces and online shopping venues expanded in Pakistan, with renowned brands, grocery shops, and general stores adopting systematic and haphazard approaches alike.
He observed that the e-commerce sector continues to demonstrate demand and sustainability in the market, with a gradual increase in its market size. However, there remains a large untapped market that market players should target, not through competition, but through coordination and collaboration within the sector.
Challenges
Sellers often face logistical, inventory management, and market competition challenges. Similarly, buyers may encounter occasional issues like delivery delays or concerns about product quality. These challenges are actively being addressed to ensure customer satisfaction.
Moreover, full-day internet disruptions can significantly impact business operations, resulting in temporary service disruptions, delayed order processing, and difficulties in maintaining seamless connectivity with customers.

1,Rupee strong below 278/$,Currency maintains rising streak for 12th straight day,"In an outstanding rally, Pakistani currency on Friday strengthened further and stood below Rs278 against the US dollar for the first time in five and a half months in the inter-bank market, maintaining its winning streak for the 12th consecutive working day.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the rupee extended gains by 0.03%, or Rs0.08, on a day-on-day basis and closed at Rs277.95 against the greenback.
With this, the currency has cumulatively increased 10.49%, or Rs29.15, in the past over six and a half months compared to the record low close of Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan reported that the local currency appreciated 0.05%, or Rs0.14, closing at Rs280.27/$ in the open market.
The latest surge in the rupee value came after the central bank reported an uptick in its foreign exchange reserves for the third consecutive week, which indicated that inflows of the foreign currency remained higher than its demand.
The reserves rose $4 million to $8.02 billion in the week ended March 22, 2024, according to the latest weekly update released by the SBP on Thursday.Market talk suggests exporters are selling dollar proceeds on forward counters in maximum possible quantities because of an upbeat outlook on the rupee, which is expected to improve further and cause losses to those who hold dollars for a longer period. In addition, overseas Pakistanis are sending relatively higher remittances to their family members to help them meet higher expenditures during Ramazan and for Eid festival.
Apart from this, the IMF executive board is expected to give its final approval for the release of last loan tranche of $1.1 billion for Pakistan in late April. This will further improve the foreign exchange reserves and enhance capacity to smoothly repay foreign debt on time.
Gold price on Friday surged Rs3,800 per tola (11.66 grams), standing above six-and-a-half-month high at Rs234,800 in line with the global trend.
In the international market, the precious metal hit a record high on hopes for a reduction in the benchmark US interest rate.
The All Pakistan Saraf Gems and Jewellers Association reported that bullion spiked $40 to $2,254 per ounce in the global market.

2,SLG’s Rs600m IPO marks PSX’s 2024 debut,Receives purchase orders for 50.69 million shares from investors against 50 million offered,"Secure Logistics Group (SLG) successfully attracted a price of Rs12 per share in the two-day Dutch bidding, raising Rs600 million by selling 50 million shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) in this week’s auction.
The initial public offering (IPO) by the first-ever logistics company on the PSX was oversubscribed, with purchase orders for 50.69 million shares from investors against the 50 million shares offered.
The company stated in its pre-IPO prospectus that the primary goals of raising equity capital are to deleverage the balance sheet in a challenging high-interest rate environment, advance the company’s technological infrastructure to complete the Tech-Pivot initiative, expand into regional markets, and enhance fleet-related efficiencies.
Shares were offered at a minimum price of Rs12 per share, with the potential to increase by 40% to Rs16.80 per share during the auction and book-building process.
This marks the first company listed on the PSX in 2024, ending a seven-month period with no IPOs at the exchange. The last IPO was held in August 2023.
SLG aims to establish itself as a ‘Regional Player’ by forging connections with Central Asian markets, leveraging the strategic advantages offered by the proximity of sea ports in Pakistan, as stated in the prospectus. Additionally, it plans to augment its current fleet by adding a minimum of five distribution vehicles, partially funded through the equity raised at the PSX.
The pre-IPO capital raise was Rs585 million, led by existing institutional shareholders, namely, Saudi Bugshan Group and Karandaaz Pakistan, translating into a total capital raise of Rs1.19 billion.
A brief press statement noted strong participation from institutional and high-net-worth individual investors during the two-day book-building process. Institutional investors accounted for 76% of participation, while the remaining 24% of bids came from high-net-worth individual investors. However, the company will issue 75% of the 50 million shares to successful bidders, with the remaining 25% allocated to retail investors at the strike price of Rs12 per share later on.

3,Inflation down by 0.09%,"Despite dip in food costs, overall inflation remains high, prompting policy speculation","Inflation decreased by 0.09% in the week ending March 28, driven by a drop in food prices, marking the second consecutive week of deceleration compared to the previous week.
According to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics’ data, the weekly inflation rate remained slightly elevated at 29.41% in the reviewed week compared to the same week last year. Weekly inflation is measured through the Sensitive Price Indicator, which contains 51 essential kitchen items.
During the week, out of 51 items, prices of 04 (7.84%) items increased, 18 (35.30%) items decreased, and 29 (56.86%) items remained unchanged from the previous week. Tomatoes led the list of price drops on a week-on-week basis, decreasing by 12.04% to Rs92.71/kg. This was followed by wheat flour, dropping by 3.80% to Rs2,628.69/20-kg bag.
The prices of other commodities reduced by up to 2.59%, including garlic, LPG, onions, potatoes, bananas, pulse gram, and sugar. However, the prices of chicken, eggs, shirting, and rice Irri 6/9 increased by up to 5% in the week.
The year-on-year trend depicts an increase of 29.41%, with gas charges for Q1 making a heavy contribution to the 570% rise in its price. Other commodities increased by up to 86.05%, including chilli powder, onions, men’s sponge chappal, men’s sandal, garlic, gur, chicken, salt powder, sugar, energy saver, and pulse mash.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Friday that overall inflation is decelerating except for food prices, which are temporarily up due to Ramazan.
He hoped that food prices would soon normalise, and the inflation rate would maintain a downturn due to factors including the low base effect. The drop in inflation is expected to be followed by a cut in the benchmark interest rate, which currently stands at a record high of 22%.
Optimus Capital Management, Head of Research, Maaz Azam said the benchmark monthly inflation rate, measured through the Consumer Price Index, is estimated to slow down to 20.5% in March compared to the same month last year, “finally making the real interest rate (interest rate minus inflation rate) positive on a spot basis.”
However, MoM, inflation is projected to accelerate by 1.6% in March.

4,FBR attaches CAA bank accounts to recover taxes,"Collects Rs13b from aviation body, gets closer to 9-month revenue target","The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has attached bank accounts of Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to recover taxes worth Rs13 billion, in a move that pushed it closer to the nine-month revenue target of Rs6.7 trillion.
Till the last official working day, the FBR collected Rs6.67 trillion, remaining short of the nine-month goal by Rs41 billion.
“Banks will remain open during holidays and we are in a position to achieve the nine-month target of Rs6.707 trillion,” said FBR Chairman Malik Amjad Zubair Tiwana while talking to The Express Tribune. He added that another payment of Rs34 billion would be received on Saturday.
Sources said that the FBR attached bank accounts of CAA and recovered Rs13 billion. The aviation authority had claimed income tax exemption on the back of two new enactments that parliament approved in August last year.
The tax exemption had not been given through the Income Tax Ordinance. It was the incompetence of the Law Division that vetted a bill which was not consistent with the main tax law – the Income Tax Ordinance.
The Express Tribune reported on Friday that Pakistan granted Rs50 billion in annual income tax exemption to two government departments in violation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and its own tax law.
CAA and Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) were granted tax exemptions through two Acts of parliament weeks after approval of a $3 billion IMF standby arrangement (SBA).
Read Tax exemptions of Rs50b defy IMF
The FBR is of the view that the Income Tax Ordinance is the “only special law” dealing with taxation. Therefore, for taxes, neither the Pakistan Civil Aviation Act, 2023 nor the Pakistan Airport Authority Act, 2023 are special laws, it added.
Pakistan has agreed with the IMF that it will not grant any income tax exemption and if its monthly targets fall short, it stands ready to take additional revenue measures.
For March, the government had set the tax target at Rs879 billion while the nine-month (July-March) target was Rs6.707 trillion.
Till Friday, the last working day of March, the FBR collected Rs835 billion and it needed another Rs44 billion to achieve the monthly goal. Over the past two months, the FBR has missed its monthly targets.
A reason for remaining behind the nine-month target was the sudden release of Rs65 billion in withheld refunds to exporters. After assuming office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had instructed the FBR to immediately release the refund claims.
The PM said on Tuesday that he had ordered the FBR not to withhold taxpayers’ genuine refunds to inflate revenue collection.
The FBR also gave Rs369 billion in tax refunds in nine months, which was 45% higher than the last fiscal year. In March alone, the FBR released refunds of Rs67 billion compared to just Rs21 billion in March last year.
The FBR collected taxes of Rs6.67 trillion till the official working time, showing an increase of Rs1.51 trillion, or 29%, over the collection made during the same period of the previous fiscal year. Authorities hope that after the next two days’ collection, the growth rate will jump above 30%.
The FBR remains confident about achieving its Rs9.415 trillion annual target despite a slump in imports.

5,SIFC vows to address investor woes,"Receives praise from diplomats for tackling red tape, facilitating businesses","Pakistan has received an encouraging response from ambassadors of numerous countries who have appreciated the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) for effectively addressing the challenge of red tape and facilitating ease of doing business.
Pakistan has been facing criticism from foreign investors because of inconsistency in policies and the hurdles created by the civil bureaucracy and political governments.
SIFC has assured continuity of policies and has been able to address concerns of foreign investors. It has also given assurances of expediting work on the projects being executed in the country.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a recent meeting, appreciated the robust SIFC mechanism, which had effectively addressed the issue of red tape and was ensuring ease of doing business.
The premier revealed that ambassadors of numerous countries had appreciated the role of SIFC.
He underscored the need for a “Charter of Solidarity and Economic Progress” to put the country back on track of economic expansion and political stability.
He stressed that Pakistan’s economic and financial position was gradually improving.

In this regard, he mentioned that during the period from April 2022 to August 2023, the government provided major relief and saved the country from default, which enabled the successor caretaker government to engage with the IMF meaningfully and successfully get the loan programme resumed.
As a result of such efforts, the PM added, market confidence was growing and the economy was continuing its recovery on the back of prudent fiscal policies.
He expressed satisfaction that the second International Monetary Fund (IMF) review had concluded successfully but emphasised the need for freeing the country from all foreign debt as the government’s policy was to facilitate and promote foreign investment rather than rely on loans. For this purpose, viable propositions were being prepared for productive sectors of the economy.
Taking stock of the performance of various divisions, PM Shehbaz stated that gaps in delivery of services and areas for improvement were being identified and steps were being taken to improve the efficiency of government departments.
Discussing the impediments to effective tax collection, he cited the large number of recovery cases, worth billions of rupees, pending in tribunals and courts for many years. He directed the law and justice minister to contact the relevant tribunals and provincial chief ministers and ask them to approach and request the high courts to decide the cases on priority.
The PM apprised the cabinet of the reform initiatives being undertaken in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). In this regard, the premier himself presided over several meetings and it was decided that reforms would include 100% digitisation of the FBR. In addition, international consultants would be engaged by the third week of April 2024.
He emphasised that honest officers would be appreciated and rewarded, but corrupt persons would not be tolerated.
He asserted that existing taxpayers should not be squeezed beyond limit as it was completely counterproductive, rather tax base must be expanded. Minister of finance and revenue was asked to supervise the task.
It was pointed out that a committee, headed by the Planning Commission deputy chairman, had been constituted to present a practical plan for reduction in government expenditures. The cabinet had been apprised that deliberations were underway and a report of the committee with recommendations would be presented next week.

7,Record-breaking rally halts at PSX,"KSE-100 index sheds 137.02 points, settles at 67,005.11","A two-day record-breaking rally paused on Friday at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) as it dropped nearly 140 points over profit-taking by investors, an unimpressive economic growth and a hike in power tariffs.
Federal Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb visited the PSX, where he asserted that Pakistan was expected to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a three-year Extended Fund Facility by the end of June.
In the morning, trading began on a positive note where market players anticipated a good outcome of government’s efforts to speed up the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and other state-owned entities.
However, trading remained range bound as the finance minister indicated that next fiscal year’s budget may not be “pro-growth”.
In addition, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) raised power tariff and the National Accounts Committee reported just 1% economic growth for 2QFY24, which caused jitters in the market.
The KSE-100 index touched its intra-day low of 66,822.43 around midday. Later, it recouped some of the losses and closed with a decline of 137 points.
“Stocks closed lower amid institutional profit-taking after Pakistan posted a dismal GDP growth of 1% for 2QFY24 and Nepra’s approval for an increase in power tariff under quarterly adjustment,” said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.
“The finance minister hinted at a reduction in development spending and energy sector reforms ahead of Pakistan-IMF talks on April 14-15. Besides, surging treasury bond yields played the role of catalyst in bearish close of the market,” he added.
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a loss of 137.02 points, or 0.20%, and settled at 67,005.11.

Topline Securities, in its report, said that a range-bound session was observed at the PSX as the KSE-100 index traded between the intra-day high of 166 points and intra-day low of -320 points. It closed at 67,005, down 0.2%.
Major positive contribution of 515 points to the index came from Meezan Bank, Engro Corporation, MCB Bank, Pakistan Tobacco and Colgate-Palmolive.
On the flip side, Fauji Fertiliser, Bank Alfalah, Oil and Gas Development Company, TRG Pakistan and Hub Power pulled the index down by 451 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its review, remarked that stocks reached new highs with gains of 2.8% week-on-week.
On Friday, Engro Corporation (+1.47%), MCB Bank (+1.61%) and Meezan Bank (+1.15%) were the biggest contributors to the index gains.
Total participation in Secure Logistics book-building came in at Rs611 million versus offer of Rs600 million at a strike price of Rs12 per share, it said. In addition, Bank Alfalah (-2.86%) was set to start due diligence for acquiring Saudi National Bank’s 100% stake after Samba Bank.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 313.04 million shares against Thursday’s tally of 421.1 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs9.9 billion.
Shares of 343 companies were traded. Of these, 136 stocks closed higher, 188 dropped and 19 remained unchanged.

8,SBP facilitated govt debt: report,Says central bank provided indirect loans to govt leading to high inflation,"An independent think tank has criticised the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for its role in implementing fiscal expansionary policies by indirectly providing loans to the federal government, a move that has rendered the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-guided changes in the central bank law ineffective.
In its report titled “Pakistan Economic Freedom Audit: The Sound Money,” the Policy Research Institute of Market Economy (PRIME) has underscored the adverse implications of the central bank-finance ministry nexus, which has led to high inflation and contributed to debt accumulation.
While the amended SBP Act has curtailed the government’s capacity to issue debt directly to the SBP, monetary expansion has persisted. The PRIME report indicates that the SBP has supplied liquidity to banks, which subsequently lend it to the government. The report was authored by Dr Wasim Shahid Malik.
The PRIME stated that the SBP has mainly supplied liquidity to scheduled banks through Open Market Operations, allowing them to subsequently lend to the government. Thus, the SBP indirectly provided funds to the government through scheduled banks. According to banking industry sources, as of the first week of this month, the central bank had lent Rs10.3 trillion to commercial banks through open market operations.
The PRIME remarked, “Setting the policy rate to contain inflation while expanding the money supply in response to government borrowing from scheduled banks is unproductive.”
Under the last Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the IMF had prohibited the federal government from directly borrowing from the central bank. However, the government circumvented this restriction with the complicity of the central bank, which facilitated government borrowing through indirect means.
Over the past five years, broad money has seen an average annual growth rate of 14.6%.
Read PSX bounces back on SBP, IMF optimism
During the fiscal year 2022-23, Pakistan witnessed a significant increase in its annual inflation rate. While the average annual inflation rate over the past decade stood at 9.6%, the fiscal year 2022-23 recorded a rate of 29.2%, marking the second-highest rate in Pakistan’s history.
The zero borrowing restriction has not helped in containing the money supply; instead, it increased the cost of borrowing for the government. The central bank prints notes and sells them to commercial banks, which, in turn, lend the money to the government at higher rates.
PRIME noted that the SBP recently adopted a reactionary stance in response to inflation and currency depreciation. However, this approach proved to be ineffective. The interest rate, serving as the SBP’s monetary policy instrument, has had little success in controlling inflation and exchange rates.
During the fiscal year 2022-23, Pakistan experienced a historically high depreciation of its currency value, prompting questions about the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments, added the report. In response, the SBP raised the policy rate from 9.75% in January 2022 to an unprecedented 22% in June 2023. However, despite this substantial increase, the market did not perceive a tight policy stance, leading to prevailing market uncertainty. Consequently, the Pakistani Rupee depreciated significantly against major currencies, accompanied by a historically high inflation rate.
The PRIME highlighted that the overvaluation of the exchange rate has resulted in a trade deficit, leading to external debt accumulation. These factors contribute to the monetary fragility currently facing Pakistan. The PRIME report has proposed holding the government accountable for violating the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act and introducing new legislation to prevent currency manipulation by the government.
“An Act of Parliament can restrict the deliberate overvaluation of the exchange rate, for which a suitable indicator needs to be developed,” it recommended.
Pakistan economic freedom rating falls
The report highlighted that Pakistan’s sound money rating has reached its historically lowest level due to high inflation and double-digit growth in monetary expansion. Fluctuations in the sound money rating were driven by recent inflation, its volatility, and monetary growth in the near past, while the score on foreign currency accounts remained stable, according to PRIME.
Recent assessments reveal that Pakistan’s sound money rating for 2023 is 4.6, the lowest in history, primarily due to exceptionally high inflation during the year, it added. Pakistan’s economy’s sound money category was assessed using the Fraser Institute methodology.
This score reflects a concerning state of affairs regarding the country’s economic freedom. Specifically, Pakistan’s performance has significantly declined compared to the last two ratings, with a decrease of one quarter. This score is the country’s lowest in the past four decades.
The value of money has consistently depreciated over time. From 1974 to 2001, its purchasing power for goods and services included in the CPI basket declined by one-tenth, and from 1974 to 2023, by one-sixty-eighths. The Pakistani Rupee has also experienced a similar decline in value against foreign currencies. For instance, the value of one US dollar in Pakistani rupees increased from less than 10 in 1974 to 248 in 2023, resulting in a 25-fold cumulative loss.
However, monetary growth during this period exceeded 1000 times, indicating inefficiencies in both monetary and fiscal policies that have contributed to this expansion and, ultimately, the devaluation of money.

9,Petrol price expected to rise by Rs10/litre in April,Potential increase could exacerbate inflation concerns; tax hike also on horizon,"The federal government is likely to raise petrol prices by up to Rs10/litre, effective from April 1, 2024, which could have a serious inflationary impact on the lives of ordinary citizens.
The recent increase in petrol prices is attributed to a rise in the premium from $12.15/barrel to $13.507/barrel, marking a $1.45/barrel increment. If the government passes on the full impact to the general public before Eidul Azha, the price of petrol will exceed that of high-speed diesel, rising from Rs279.75 to Rs289.75/litre. Additionally, the Inland Freight Equalisation Margin on petrol is expected to be Rs5.01/litre.
There might be a slight decrease of Rs1.30/litre in the price of HSD, as the premium on HSD remains at $6.50/barrel, as in the last two reviews of petroleum products. IFEM on HSD is expected to be Rs3.76/litre.

This increase in POL product prices is anticipated to occur without the proposed imposition of an 18% GST. However, if GST is levied, prices could surge by an additional Rs50/litre on petrol. Currently, the government imposes a petroleum levy of Rs60/litre, amounting to 21.4% of the current petrol price. 
An FBR official noted that there are currently no proposals under consideration to impose sales tax on POL products. Nevertheless, the estimated revenue from an 18% sales tax on POL products could range between Rs21 billion to 25 billion per month.
