0,Govt shortlists ex-CJs for judicial meddling probe,Federal cabinet set to greenlight formation of inquiry commission today,"The federal government is exploring options among retired judges to lead a one-man inquiry commission tasked with investigating the claims made by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) regarding the interference of the country’s intelligence apparatus in judicial affairs.
According to a senior government official speaking to The Express Tribune, the government has shortlisted former chief justices Nasirul Mulk, and Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, as well as retired justices Maqbool Baqar, Manzoor Ahmed Malik, and Mushir Alam for consideration.
The next step involves gauging their availability to head the inquiry commission.
The official stated that the federal cabinet is set to greenlight the formation of the inquiry commission on Saturday (today). The notification will promptly follow thereafter. The cabinet is scheduled to convene at 12 pm.
The official further revealed that during a meeting with Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, discussions were held regarding the Terms of Reference (TORs) for the commission.
He also revealed that the proposal regarding the formation of the inquiry commission came from the superior judiciary.
Furthermore, it was disclosed that these six judges have eased the government's task, and now the law officers will seek their recusal in case they preside over cases related to Imran Khan and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
""We are very surprised about the timing of the issuance of this letter as they pointed out the incidents which happened during the tenure of ex-CJP Umar Ata Bandial. These judges should have raised this issue during the caretaker government. Now, when the new government has formed and Imran Khan cases are being filed in IHC, they decided to write this letter,” the senior government official added.
'Preemptive strike'
The federal government seems to be taking the issuance of the letter by the six IHC judges in stride.
Many government officials believe that the majority of SC judges are losing sleep over the issuance of this letter compared to the executive functionaries. They view the letter as a preemptive strike before the commencement of misconduct proceedings against one IHC judge.
However, a senior lawyer contends that following the issuance of the letter, the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) would be unable to take action against these judges. The government ought to bear in mind that there is a distinction between Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi and these six judges, who enjoy broad support from various segments of society.
Meanwhile, it has been gathered that only three judges vehemently objected to the formation of the inquiry commission, while the majority of judges are aligned with CJP Isa.
While the superior bars led by the Independent Group support the establishment of the inquiry commission, various provincial bars such as the Lahore High Court Bar Association, Islamabad High Court Bar Association, and Balochistan High Court Bar Association are expressing serious apprehension regarding the constitution of the inquiry commission.
""We reject inquiry commission. We will demand a commission comprising five senior most judges. If this commission was not formed then a constitutional petition will be filed in this matter,” Munir Kakar, who is the candidate for the next presidential election of the Supreme Court Bar Association, said. He belongs to the Professional Lawyers Group.
‘Emperor is naked’
Former additional attorney general Tariq Mahmood Khokhar contended that the actions of six judges “have shouted the emperor is naked’.
However, the concern extends beyond these six judges to encompass all 126 judges across the nation's five high courts, he added.
""We do not need a commission of inquiry to determine the obvious: that the State coercion of the judiciary was and remains a constant occurrence. No commission can deny what the entire nation affirms,” he said.
He said a simple acknowledgement of errors, stupidity and contrition accompanied by a credible resolve of future restraint should suffice to defuse the crisis.
“The redressal ought to be effected through judicial processes, from within the superior courts and under existing law.”
Khokhar said that the judiciary is and ought to be the guardian of its independence. Any attempt to act through proxy or outsourcing would constitute an anathema to the very independence of the judiciary, he added.
Meanwhile, different bars have decided to move constitutional petitions in this matter.
Furthermore, Kakar further disclosed that representatives from Balochistan bars will convene a meeting on March 30 to determine the next steps regarding the matter involving the six IHC judges.
The conference will discuss the contentious letter written by the six judges of the Islamabad High Court and the future course of action. All representatives have been requested to attend the meeting.
In a parallel development, six members of the Pakistan Bar Council belonging to the Professional Group have resolved to take the matter of the letter to the Supreme Court.
Meanwhile, the federal cabinet has called for a session on Saturday (today) to greenlight the formation of a commission to investigate the allegations made by IHC judges regarding the meddling of intelligence agencies in judicial affairs.
Prime Minister Shehbaz has summoned the federal cabinet meeting. The meeting will take place today at 12 pm.
The issue of the letter from the IHC judges will be discussed in the cabinet meeting. The approval will be sought for the formation of a commission to inquire into the allegations made by the IHC judges.
The federal cabinet meeting will have a five-point agenda. The meeting has been delayed due to the prime minister’s engagements. The cabinet meeting will be held via Zoom, and most ministers will participate in the online session.

1,Aurangzeb plans to bolster tax revenue by Rs2.5tr,Finance minister says govt eyes fresh IMF deal by June,"Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said the government is targeting to win a staff-level agreement (SLA) for the next IMF loan programme by the end of June 2024, aiming to secure a three-year EFF (extended fund facility) while the size of the package is yet to be determined through deliberation and discussions.
During his first visit to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday after assuming the office, the minister cautiously hinted that the budget ""pro-growth"" for the next fiscal year 2024-25 may not be pro-growth.
Instead, he outlined plans to bolster tax revenue by a substantial Rs2.5 trillion, potentially reaching a total of Rs12 trillion this fiscal year (FY24). This strategy entails resolving financial disputes within three months, implementing a track and trace system, and appointing an international consultant for end-to-end digitalisation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) by the end of April.
These measures are aimed at curbing financial leakages, while simultaneously boosting revenue and remittances.
The finance minister maintained the government was targeting to get into the bidding process to privatise PIA and outsource airports by June, moving closer to completing these endeavours.
He emphasised that super taxes, windfall taxes, and businesses reliant on import-led subsidies are no longer sustainable moving forward.
The private sector would lead growth and the country, infrastructure projects would be done on a public-private partnership model to create fiscal space with the government. The inflation rate would gradually go down this year which is hoped to be followed by a cut in the central bank's policy rate, Aurangzeb said.
He said that during the second and the last successful economic review by the IMF for the last tranche of $1.1 billion to Pakistan earlier this month, the Fund has given a very encouraging response over the country's aiming to enter into a ""larger and longer program.""
Pakistan would formally request the IMF for a new package during the IMF and World Bank's annual meeting being held in Washington in mid-April.
""We will try to get EFF further formalised and discuss features of the program…Those discussions will go into end-April into May.
We wish to achieve a staff-level agreement for the next program by the time we rape up this fiscal year by the end of June or first of July (2024).""
He, however, said it is premature to say anything that would be the size of the program. Discussions in this regard are yet to begin.
Reports, however, suggest the government is considering requesting for the program in the range of $5-8 billion for three years.
The plans for a fresh deal with the global lender come as Pakistan recently successfully completed the second and final review under a short-term IMF stand-by arrangement worth $3 billion. This paved the way for the release of the last tranche, totalling nearly $1.1 billion.
Despite this achievement, Pakistan's delicate $350-billion economy remains in dire need of external financing to bolster its foreign exchange reserves and avert another macroeconomic crisis. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also earlier hinted at the inevitability of seeking additional IMF assistance while acknowledging the pressing economic challenges upon assuming the highest political office in the country.
Sustainable growth
Responding to a question during his visit on Friday, Aurangzeb said the import and consumption-led model has failed to achieve sustainable economic growth.
""Pro-growth budget means you run out of dollars because it was import led…. the moment you run out of dollars you have to go back to those institutions (IMF for another program). So that is not sustainable. We have to transform it into an export-led growth model (and that will not happen over the night).""
He said the turnaround in agriculture output and software and technology exports would remain the two major driving forces of ramping up the economic growth gradually this year and in the next year as well.
Pakistan is expecting a bumper crop of wheat as well after achieving a bumper crop of rice this year. Farmers are producing 36 maund (40kg) per acre at present. We will become self-sufficient in the staple crops if the per acre yield is increased to 40 maund/acre and we can export if by taking yield to over 40 maund/acre.""
The country is projected to roughly achieve IT exports of $3.2 billion this year (FY24). It would be taken to $4-4.5 billion next year, he said.
""These (agri and tech) are the levers of growth which are in our hands. No one has stopped us from doing so, but implementation and execution are lacking in almost all the sectors. IMF program and no program…has nothing to do with achieving them and this totally depends upon us.""
He said Pakistan can generate additional revenue in taxes worth Rs2.5 trillion through concluding cases in financial leakages of Rs1.7 trillion that have been pending for quite a long time.  ""We need to make decisions in the next three months. We may potentially win cases for half of the amount (Rs850 billion) from here.""
Besides, other financial leakages of Rs3 trillion can be controlled through implementing a track and trace system.
""If we control the leakages of half of the amount (Rs1.5 trillion), the sum of the potentially recoverable amount comes around to Rs2.5 trillion. This would take our total collection of revenue to the tune of Rs12 trillion against the set target for Rs9.4 trillion for FY24.""
Besides, the power system is facing theft and leakages worth another Rs500 billion, he said, adding the government has initiated work to control it as well.
The Rs2-2.5 trillion will go to the marginalised population and enhance the BISP program, he said.
The minister said the government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has continued the process of Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) restructuring which was initiated by the caretaker government and particularly by the interim finance minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar.
The government is aimed at fully digitalising FBR to end human intervention, human error and transparency. This will minimise financial leakages, and increase collection of revenue and remittances. In this regard, the government will launch an RFP (request for proposals) to appoint a world-class consultant on April 8, 2024.
The government would appoint and announce the name of the consultant by the end of April. Dr Shamshad Akhtar and other experts remain on the board to culminate FBR restructuring.
He said It is the private sector that has to lead this country. ""The government's work is to provide policy framework and policy continuity. Government has no business in being business.""
PSX can help raise funds for infrastructure projects.  The private sector will be on board around the time of budget preparation for FY25.
Throughout his address and question and answer session, he reiterated the nation knows what the problems are and what their solutions are, not for years but for decades. However, implementation and execution are lacking.

2,51 sentenced to five years for May 9 riots,Gujranwala ATC becomes first court to convict people in last year’s unrest,"An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Saturday sentenced 51 people to five years in jail for attacking the Gujranwala cantonment on May 9, 2023, following the first arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan—the first batch of suspects to be convicted in the May 9 related cases.
These suspects were booked and arrested by the Rahwali Cantt police over charges of attacks on sensitive army facilities, arson, killing a citizen, and attacks on cops causing injuries to them, as well as vandalism of government property.
ATC Judge Natasha Naseem Sipra handed down rigorous imprisonment of five years and a fine of Rs10,000 each to the suspects, with a further jail time of 10 days in case of default under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
Under the five other charges, including roadblock, they were sentenced to one year in jail under the provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) for each count. However, the prosecution failed to prove the charges of killing and attempted murder against them.

All punishments handed down by the court shall be cumulative, and in default of payment of the fine, the convicts shall be liable to an additional 10 days of imprisonment.
Following a complaint filed by SHO Mudassar Butt, the Rahwali Cantt police station registered a case against 23 identified individuals and approximately 300 to 400 others for vandalizing state and military properties, causing injuries to 10 cops, including a superintendent, and causing the loss of a civilian life in last year’s May 9 riots. Additionally, four vehicles were damaged during the unrest.
Subsequently, 51 suspects, including a PTI independent candidate, were apprehended in connection with the disturbances. The trial of these individuals continued inside jail for three months. Several PTI leaders named in the case are on interim bail from courts, and their challans are pending.
The convicts will be entitled to the benefit of Section 382-B of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The section stipulates that the detention time of a prisoner has to be considered in the jail term when a person is convicted by a court. It means that the detention periods served so far will also be counted as part of the jail terms announced and subtracted from the sentence of five years.

3,Ex-CJ Jillani to helm IHC letter inquiry,Cabinet finalises ToRs for inquiry commission,"The federal government on Saturday appointed former chief justice of Pakistan Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as the head of an inquiry commission tasked with investigating allegations of intelligence agencies meddling in the affairs of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The federal government on Saturday appointed former chief justice of Pakistan Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as the chief of an inquiry commission tasked with probing allegations that the county’s intelligence agencies are meddling into the affairs of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The decision to approve the formation of an investigation body and to nominate Jillani as its head was made during a meeting of the federal cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
On Tuesday, six judges of the IHC—Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz—penned a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), expressing their concerns about the ""interference"" of the intelligence agencies in the affairs of the court.
Against the backdrop of escalating clamour for inquiry, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa convened a full court meeting of the top court judges the next day.
During a meeting between PM Shehbaz and CJP Isa on Thursday, it was decided to form a commission following the cabinet’s approval to probe into the concerns raised by the IHC judges.
The federal cabinet meeting on Saturday discussed the IHC judges’ allegations and finalised the Terms of Reference (TORs) for the inquiry commission.
According to the TORs, the commission will thoroughly investigate the allegations levelled in the letter written by the IHC judges and determine whether they were true or not. It will also find out whether or not any official was directly involved in the alleged judicial interference.
The TORs further stated that the commission would recommend action against any intelligence agency, department or government body based on the facts revealed in its investigation.
The commission will also have the authority to examine any other matter it deemed necessary during the course of its inquiry.
The cabinet rejected the allegations of the six IHC judges, terming them inappropriate.
Its members were of the unanimous opinion that the Constitution strongly believed in the principle of separation of powers of the three state institutions.

PM Shehbaz reiterated his complete faith in the independence of the judiciary and the principle of constitutional separation of powers. He also confided in the cabinet members about his consultation with the CJP on the letter.The commission will complete its inquiry within 60 days.
Justice (retd) Jillani had also expressed his willingness to lead the inquiry commission after being contacted by Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar.
Talking to The Express Tribune, the former CJP said this was a “sensitive issue” and he had accepted the responsibility to lead the commission. “We will start our proceedings on it after Eidul Fitr,” he added.
To a query, he replied that it was not an open judicial proceeding.
“Whether it will be open or not, I will not say anything about it now because it is a sensitive matter. However, the commission will complete its proceedings in Islamabad.”
Justice (retd) Jillani further said the commission would complete its proceedings according to the rules and regulations decided in the full court.
The former CJP was nicknamed “a gentleman judge” for his mild manners.
In October 2017, the government had nominated him as an ad hoc judge in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the case of Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav.
Justice (retd) Jillani served as a judge of the Supreme Court from July 31, 2004 to December 11, 2013 and subsequently as the 21st CJP from December 12, 2013 to July 5, 2014.
He was born on July 6, 1949 in Multan and completed his Masters in Political Science from Forman Christian College and LLB from the University of Punjab.
He started his legal practice at the Multan district courts in 1974 and in 1976 was elected the general secretary of the district bar association.
He was elected a member of the Punjab Bar Council in 1978 and appointed assistant advocate general of Punjab in July 1979. He was enrolled as advocate of the SC in 1983 and appointed an additional advocate general of Punjab in 1993.
He took oath as a judge of the Lahore High Court on August 7, 1994 and was elevated to the SC on July 31, 2004 where he served till the imposition of the state of emergency on November 3, 2007. As he refused to take a fresh oath, he was made dysfunctional.
He took oath again as a judge of the SC in 2008.
