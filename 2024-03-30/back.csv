0,Biden acknowledges 'pain' of Arab Americans over war in Gaza,"We are working to establish an immediate ceasefire lasting at least six weeks, says Biden","Joe Biden on Friday acknowledged ""the pain being felt"" by many Arab Americans over the war in Gaza and over US support of Israel and its military offensive that has left Arabs, Muslims and anti-war activists angry and disappointed.
Many Muslims and Arabs in the United States have urged the Democratic president to call for a permanent ceasefire, stop the sale of weapons to Israel and use more leverage to protect civilian lives as a humanitarian crisis unfolds in Gaza.
""We must also pause to reflect on the pain being felt by so many in the Arab American community with the war in Gaza,"" Biden said in a proclamation on Arab American Heritage Month released by the White House, adding he was ""devastated"" by the suffering.
However, hours after Biden's Friday statement, the Washington Post reported that his government had signed off on additional bombs and warplanes for Israel in recent days worth billions of dollars.
Israel is the leading recipient of U.S. foreign aid, and the U.S. vetoed multiple votes at the United Nations calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza assault, before abstaining from a vote in late March.
The Biden administration has issued proclamations since 2021 ahead of April, which is observed as Arab American Heritage Month. This year's proclamation was longer than previous ones due to Biden's comments on Gaza.
Protests demanding a ceasefire in Gaza have occurred in many US cities in recent months, including near airports, opens new tab and bridges in New York City, opens new tab and Los Angeles, vigils outside the White House and marches in Washington, opens new tab.
Demonstrators have regularly interrupted Biden's campaign events and speeches, including a high profile fundraiser.
They have asked Biden to meet their demands or risk losing their support. Arab and Muslim Americans are unlikely to back Biden's rival, Republican former President Donald Trump, but observers note they could sit out the election and deny Biden crucial votes. They had overwhelmingly supported Biden in 2020.
Biden said on Friday he was working to increase humanitarian aid into Gaza, free captives taken by Hamas fighters and establish an immediate ceasefire lasting at least six weeks.
Biden also said Arab Americans have been a target of hate crimes while noting the fatal October stabbing of 6-year-old Palestinian American Wadea Al-Fayoume in Illinois, the November shooting of three students, opens new tab of Palestinian descent in Vermont, and the February stabbing of a Palestinian American man, in Texax.
Israel's brutal military assault on Gaza has killed over 32,000 people, according to the local health ministry, displaced nearly all of its 2.3 million population, put the enclave on the brink of starvation and led to accusations of genocide that Israel denies.

1,Massive crane put in place to clear Baltimore bridge debris as crews assess damage,Maryland awarded $60 million by US govt to clear debris and begin rebuilding,"The biggest operational crane on the US Eastern Seaboard towered over Baltimore's port on Friday, ready to begin clearing the wreckage of the Francis Scott Key Bridge days after a cargo ship crashed into it, sending the span crashing into the harbor.
Crews were still surveying the damage as of midday Friday. The crane, which can lift up to 1,000 tons, arrived late Thursday night and will probably start hauling debris out of the water on Saturday morning, according to US Coast Guard spokesperson Carmen Carver.
A second crane is en route and expected to arrive soon to assist the effort, she said.
State and federal authorities are focused on clearing the busy port and rebuilding the bridge after the Dali, a massive container ship that had lost power, plowed into a support column early on Tuesday, toppling the structure and leaving six workers presumed dead.
Divers have recovered two bodies of the missing construction workers, who were repairing the bridge at the time of the collision. The remaining four are believed to be trapped beneath the water. All were immigrants from Mexico and Central America.
Finding the remaining bodies is the top priority, Maryland Governor Wes Moore told a press conference on Thursday. Crews must also assess how to remove the stuck vessel, loaded with thousands of containers and trapped by bridge debris.
""The Dali is almost as long as the Eiffel Tower, and the Dali has the Key Bridge on top of it. We're talking 3,000 or 4,000 tons of steel that's sitting on top of that ship, so we've got work to do,"" Moore said at Thursday's press conference.
Within hours of Moore's request for emergency funds, the US government on Thursday had awarded Maryland $60 million to clear debris and begin rebuilding the bridge, a reflection of how critical the infrastructure is to shipping and transportation industries along the Eastern Seaboard.
Three days after the tragedy, the jobs of some 15,000 people whose work revolves around daily port operation are on hold. Maryland lawmakers are looking to pass emergency legislation to provide income replacement for those affected, the state senate president said this week.
The situation poses a temporary risk to the area's economy, since the port receives the greatest share of US auto imports and is one of just four on the US east coast with the 50-foot channel needed for larger cargo boats, bond rating agency Moody's Investors Service said.
Replacing the 47-year-old bridge will likely require ""years of work,"" but the port, whose operations recently surpassed pre-pandemic levels, could reopen within weeks, ""if debris is rapidly removed,"" according to a Moody's report.
""As long as the port is closed, diversion of automotive imports and other cargo to other East Coast ports will erode Baltimore's advantage as the port closest to the Midwest, to the detriment of terminal operators,"" the report said.

2,PPP may join Punjab cabinet,Ali Haider Gilani says move no way affects party’s stance taken about Centre,"In what might seem like a departure from its earlier position of not becoming part of the government, the PPP in Punjab has hinted at accepting portfolios in the provincial cabinet when it expanded after Eidul Fitr.
This move might pave the way for its entry into the federal cabinet as well.
Ali Haider Gilani, the PPP parliamentary leader in the Punjab Assembly, told The Express Tribune that his party was highly likely to become part of the provincial cabinet on its expansion in the second phase.
The PPP had vowed to support the PML-N in forming the government for the sake democracy but announced its resolve of not becoming part of the cabinet.
The party indeed stuck to its stance by not becoming part of either the federal or provincial cabinets.
However, a minister now in the Punjab government, then revealed that the PPP, contrary to its public position, had expressed its desire to become part of the government. She added that its request was not entertained.
it is pertinent to mention that the support from the PPP in the Centre was not an altruistic act. The party bagged several coveted positions as a quid pro quo including the president of the country.
In his conversation with The Express Tribune, Ali Haider Gilani maintained that the PPP only wanted political space for itself and there was nothing more that it desired from the PML-N.
He added that the PPP wanted proportionate representation in the provincial cabinet.
To query about deviating from the party’s stated position of not becoming accepting any portfolios, he said the PPP was only becoming part of the Punjab cabinet.
He added that his in no way affected the party’s stance taken about the Centre.
The PPP leader said his party and the PML-N were already allies in the Balochistan government so accepting ministries in Punjab would be no different.
On the question about if the decision has been made, he said the understanding was there but still the final decision would come from the party’s central leadership.
On the speculation of the PPP withdrawing Faiza Ahmed Malik from Senate elections for a reserved seat for women, he said the party had already secured a seat from Islamabad.
“So yes, Faiza might be asked to withdraw from the race,” he added.
Sources within the PPP said Ali Haider Gilani wanted to become part of the provincial cabinet from the start, but so far the decision had not been made at any forum in the party.
The PPP parliamentary leader in the Punjab Assembly claimed that the party was expected to revisit the decision about the cabinet after the Senate elections on April 2 and it could either agree in favour of the move or against it.
Political analyst Hasan Askari said if the PPP became part of the Punjab cabinet, it would be a deviation from its earlier position of staying away from the decision-making processes.
He continued that the PPP would be seen by all means as an equal partner of the PML-N if it went ahead with the move.
“The PPP too will be held accountable for the decisions of the PML-N government. It will be answerable for all the good and bad ones.”

6,SIC seeks NA discussion on IHC letter,Decides to submit adjournment motion in the lower house," 
The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), the leading opposition party in parliament comprising PTI-backed lawmakers, has decided to submit an adjournment motion in the National Assembly seeking a ""serious discussion"" on alleged state interference in judicial matters.
The motion will be submitted to the NA Speaker by MNA Aamir Ali Dogar under Rule 109 of the National Assembly Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business, 2007, and will be signed by all SIC lawmakers in the lower house of parliament.
The motion demands the routine proceedings of the assembly to be suspended in view of the situation arising from the letter written by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) chairman regarding alleged meddling in the court's affairs by state institutions.
It states that the Constitution explicitly ensures the complete independence of the judiciary, adding that the revelations made by the IHC judges indicate that the state and the current government have failed to safeguard this independence. Justice, which is the fundamental right of every citizen, is being compromised, it adds.
According to the motion, former prime minister Imran Khan, along with thousands of others, is currently in jail as a result of the state’s interference in judicial matters.
""We demand a transparent investigation of this matter,"" it says, adding that ""preservation of judicial independence, and provision of justice to every citizen be seriously debated in the National Assembly.""
On Tuesday, six IHC judges sent a letter to the SJC chairman, Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, highlighting the coercive tactics employed by intelligence agencies to influence the judiciary.
The letter whipped up a storm, prompting the SC to hold a full-court meeting. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also met CJ Isa at the latter's request on Thursday. Later, the government announced the formation of an inquiry commission led by a retired judge to probe the allegations.

7,Pakistan wants a revatalised UNGA,"Says forum is key to promoting world peace, security"," 
Emphasising the UN General Assembly’s status as the only forum with universal representation, Pakistan on Thursday said that its revitalisation was vital to promoting world peace and security, especially its authority for peace enforcement when the Security Council fails to act in a crisis
“This authority is significant in the context of the developments in Gaza,” Naeem Sabir Khan, a counsellor at the Pakistan Mission to the UN, said during a thematic debate on the “Role and Authority of the General Assembly,” at the UN Headquarters in NewYork.
While terming the revitalization of the 193-member Assembly a political rather than a procedural matter, the Pakistani representative called for boosting its role in the peaceful resolution of disputes under Chapter VI of the UN Charter that includes mediation, conciliation.
In this regard, he emphasized the need for limiting the encroachment of the Security Council on numerous “thematic” issues that fall within the ambit of the General Assembly — the agenda for women, peace and security; development and security; climate change and security.
Counsellor Sabir Khan also advocated for the General Assembly’s greater contribution to norm-building and codification of international law.
“The General Assembly’s pivotal role in addressing global concerns such as climate change, development, finance, terrorism, and disarmament, including through the establishment of subsidiary bodies needed to be reaffirmed
There was also the need for the development of the UNGA’s capacity to address emerging global challenges such as Outer Space, the Oceans, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Autonomous Weapons, the Pakistani representative said.
He also proposed the establishment of a dedicated mechanism to monitor the implementation of General Assembly resolutions, with an initial step of preparing a report on the current status of implementation by the UN Secretariat.
Counsellor Sabir Khan reiterated the Charter’s allocation of distinct yet complementary roles to the General Assembly and the Security Council, emphasizing the need to uphold and respect the Assembly’s role as the principal deliberative, policy-making, and norm-setting organ of the United Nations.

8,Neelum–Jhelum plant hits maximum capacity,Project generates 969MW after it started producing power earlier this month," 
The Neelum–Jhelum Hydropower Plant has produced 969 megawatts of electricity at its full capacity, it emerged on Friday.
The project resumed power generation earlier this month following its tail race tunnel’s inspection, according to a news statement.
It added that after the inspection, electricity was being continuously generated from the power plant according to the availability of water.
The electricity generated by the Neelum–Jhelum power plant is supplied to the national grid at different times of the day, especially at Sehri and Iftar.
The operations of the Neelum–Jhelum power project were suspended since January 10 for the examination of its tail race tunnel.
A low-flow season was chosen for the inspection of the tunnel.
A comprehensive examination of the tunnel was successfully completed during the closure.
A panel of international experts also inspected the tunnel,
The project was constructed in 2018 on Neelum River in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
According to the statement, it is a unique hydroelectric project -- 90% of which is underground.
It provides an average of 4.06 billion units of electricity to the national grid every year.
The Neelum–Jhelum Hydropower Plant has generated 19.05 billion units of electricity since it became operational.
In January this year, an official had confirmed that the power plant would be shut down for the inspection of its 3.5-km tail race tunnel to detect any defect for further correction.
In August 2023, the project had started generating electricity again after a gap of one year following the completion of the restoration work in its tail race tunnel.
A fault had developed in the Neelum-Jhelum plant on July 4, 2022, leaving the power plant dysfunctional.
Back then, the plant was running at its full capacity when an abnormal increase in water leakage was observed in the powerhouse that was controlled through continuous drainage pumps.
The next day, an emergency meeting was held between the project management and its consultants to analyse the situation and determine the root cause of the excessive water leakage.
It was observed that tail race tunnel had obtained an abnormal pressure of 616 metres instead of the normal 600 metres.
Accordingly, to ascertain the behaviour of tail race tunnel, one unit was shut down which resulted in decrease in pressure to 608 metres.
The consultants recommended that the tail race tunnel pressure should be below 604 metres. In this way, load was reduced gradually.
It was determined that the abnormal increase in pressure and water leakages was because of the blockage in the tail race tunnel and considering the safety of the structure and all other equipment, the powerhouse was shut down on July 6.
