CHARLESTON: American Danielle Collins continued her late career rich vein of form, winning the WTA Charleston Open clay court title on Sunday with a 6-2, 6-1 defeat of Russia’s Daria Kasatkina.
The victory comes a week after Collins enjoyed the biggest win of her career, clinching the Miami Open 1000 hard court title and her back-to-back wins means she will move up to 15th in the world rankings.
The 30-year-old Collins has announced that she will retire from the sport at the end of this season but has found herself playing in the form of her life and has extended her winning streak to 13 matches.
Kasatkina, the 2017 winner in Charleston, reached the final after a three-set semi-final win over top seed Jessica Pegula but Collins proved to be a step too far.
Collins, who defeated Greece’s Maria Sakkari in her semi, needed just 77 minutes to defeat Kasatkina and the contest moved decisively in her direction when she broke to go 2-0 up in the second set, celebrating with a forceful first-pump.
The change in surface from Miami made little difference to Collins who mar­ched to victory with her powerful strokeplay that was simply too much for the 26-year-old Russian.
Collins won 95.2% of first serve points and saved the two break points that she faced.
“I’m blessed to be able to have the oppo­rtunity to live out my dream, I am so grateful,” said Collins.
Kasatkina joked that she was glad to know that Collins would be leaving the tour after this season.
“I was going to stay that I’m going to miss you on the tour but after this match, I’m not sure,” she quipped.
“I am going to miss you because you are such a character, your personality is amazing. Enjoy these moments, you are playing amazing,” she said.
The Floridian has dropped just two of 28 sets in her last two tournaments.
The last player to win Miami and Charleston in the same year was Serena Williams in 2013.
Collins’ 22 wins for the season is matched only by world number one Iga Swiatek and fourth-ranked Elena Rybakina.

1,Gladbach get rare win on road at Wolfsburg,"BERLIN: Borussia Moe­n­c­hengladbach halted Ralph Hasenhuettl’s winning start at VfL Wolfsburg, recovering from...","BERLIN: Borussia Moe­n­c­hengladbach halted Ralph Hasenhuettl’s winning start at VfL Wolfsburg, recovering from a goal down to win 3-1 in the Bundesliga on Sunday.
Germany international Ridle Baku scored his first league goal of the season as Wolfsburg got off to a perfect start inside seven minutes — but that is as good as it got for the hosts.
Gladbach staged a second-half comeback, with Ko Itakura, Nathan Ngou­mou and Rocco Reitz scoring the goals that kept the Foals in the safety of mid-table.
It is Gladbach’s first away win since September in all competitions and leaves Wolfsburg with only one win since the turn of the year — last weekend’s 2-0 victory at Werder Bremen in Hasenh­uettl’s first game in charge.
Wolfsburg remain in 14th place, five points off the relegation play-off spot.
While Wolfsburg and Boru­ssia Moenc­heng­ladbach are among the Bundesliga’s unde­r­a­chievers, Sunday’s earlier game saw the meeting of two of the league’s overachievers.
Eighth-placed Hoffe­nheim ended a run of three straight de­f­e­ats with a 3-1 home victory over Augsburg, seventh, who came into the game on the back of a five-game unbea­ten run.
Hoffenheim raced into a 2-0 lead inside 20 minutes, with Wout Weghorst and Andrej Kra­m­­aric putting the hosts in charge.
Ermedin Demirovic hal­v­ed Hoffenheim’s advantage on the hour mark but Ihlas Bebou fired in a late third to rubber-stamp the win.

2,Spurs bolster CL qualifying bid with Forest victory,LONDON: Tottenham Hotspur boosted their Champions League qualifying hopes with a 3-1 home win over...,"LONDON: Tottenham Hotspur boosted their Champions League qualifying hopes with a 3-1 home win over relegation-battling Notti­ngham Forest on Sunday to move into fourth spot in the Premier League.
Second-half goals from Micky van de Ven and Pedro Porro, after Forest’s Chris Wood had cancelled out Murillo’s own goal in the opening period, helped Spurs capitalise on rivals Aston Villa and Manchester United dropping points this weekend.
Tottenham’s victory puts them level with Villa on 60 points but with a game in hand and leaves United trailing with 49 after their 2-2 draw with Liverpool.
Spurs coach Ange Postecoglou, however, told reporters that he  “couldn’t care less about the race for fourth, what I care about is the way the team is progressing”.
Tottenham led after 15 minutes when Braz­ilian Murillo, who minutes earlier almost sco­r­ed an audacious goal from inside his own half, turned Timo Werner’s cross into his own net.
Brennan Johnson then nearly doubled the home side’s lead agai­nst his former club but the forwa­rd’s effort was stopped by the str­ong hand of goalkeeper Matz Sels.
Spurs were rampant and a second goal seemed like an inevitability until Forest equalised against the run of play in the 27th minute through Wood’s fourth goal in 
four games.
The New Zealand striker should have had a second 10 minutes before the break but smashed his shot against the post from close range.
Forest felt Spurs should have been down to 10 men shortly before halftime after James Maddison appeared to strike Ryan Yates off the ball but VAR declined to intervene.
“It doesn’t look like he punched him, he punched him,” Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo told reporters.
“I was surprised that VAR didn’t tell (referee) Simon (Hooper) to review it because, honestly, with all my respect, Maddison loses his composure and it’s a punch in the stomach.”
Postecoglou revamped his midfield at the break, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Rodrigo Bentancur replacing Yves Bissouma and Pape Matar Sarr in a double switch that helped Spurs regain control.
Dutch defender van de Ven hit a thunderbolt from the edge of the area to restore Spurs’ lead after 52 minutes before Pedro Porro produced a great finish six minutes later.
The defeat leaves Forest 17th with 25 points from 32 games, above third-bottom Luton Town only on goal difference.
In  Sunday’s other game, Ole McBurnie’s last-gasp equaliser forced Chelsea  to settle for a 2-2 draw at basement club Sheffield United.
Chelsea took the lead after 11  minutes as Thiago Silva finished off Conor Gallagher’s corner at the far  post.
The Blades equalised in the 32nd minute as Gustavo Hamer’s pass sent  Jayden Bogle through on goal and the right wing-back slotted home.
Noni Madueke put Chelsea back in front in the 66th minute, cutting in from the right to drive his shot into the far corner.
Yet mid-table Chelsea’s troubled season suffered another setback  when McBurnie levelled with a close-range finish three minutes into  stoppage-time.
The Blades remain bottom of the table on 16 points with seven games  left, while Chelsea are  ninth on 44 after extending their unbeaten run to seven league games.

3,Everton deducted two more points,"LONDON: Everton have received a two-point dedu­ction, their second points cut this season, after the club’s ...","LONDON: Everton have received a two-point dedu­ction, their second points cut this season, after the club’s appeal against a Premier League charge for a breach of Profitability and Sustain­ability Rules (PSR) was unsuccessful, the league said on Monday.
The independent commission heard evidence and arguments from the club on a range of potential mitigating factors for its admitted breach of 16.6 million pounds ($21 million), including the impact of its two successive PSR charges, the league said.
“The commission determined the appropriate san­c­tion to be a two-point ded­u­ction, taking effect immediately,” it said in a statement.
The deduction leaves Ever­ton in 16th place on 27 points, two above the relegation zone.
Everton said it planned to appeal again. 
“The club and its legal representatives have beg­un the preparations to app­eal the commissions decision,” it said.  “Everton remains committed to  working collaboratively with the Lea­gue on all matters relating to PSR  but is extremely concerned by the inconsistency of different commissions  in res­pect of points deductions applied.”
Everton admitted to a breach of PSR for  the assessment period ending with the 2021-22 season, having incurred  124.5 million pounds in losses in that period. The club were  subsequently deducted 10 points in November for that breach, although  that was reduced to six on appeal.

Brest are 10 points behind leaders Paris St-Germain but four poi­n­ts clear of Lille, who lie just outside the automatic Champions Le­a­gue qualification spots in fourth.
“After going behind, we came back with some good football. And then there was that last quarter of an hour... but it was a good lesson to learn,” said Brest coach Eric Roy.
“We can’t relax too much, and we have to keep our wits about us right to the end. We saw the best and the worst of Brest, but in the end we won.”
Ismael Traore gave the visitors an early lead but Brest hit back with goals from Brendan Chardonnet, Kamory Doumbia and Steve Mounie giving them a 3-1 cushion at half-time.
Martin Satriano added a fourth on the hour to make a home win appear a certainty.
Metz, who are second-bottom five points from safety, hit back, however, with two goals in six minutes from Georges Mikautadze making it a nervous final 10 minutes for Brest.
Meanwhile, Monaco exte­nded their unbeaten run in Ligue 1 to six games with a  1-0 win over Rennes at the Stade Louis II, when both teams had  a player sent off and the home side moved back into third place thanks  to Maghnes Akliouche’s goal.
The  first half was full of attacking promise from both sides but the only  goal came in the 25th mi­n­ute when Ismail Jakobs pulled the ball back  towards the penalty spot to Akliouche whose shot found the bottom corner  of the net.
The opening minute after the break brought a red card  for Rennes forward Martin Terrier for a dangerous foul on Aklio­uche,  but less than 20 minutes later Monaco also went down to 10 men when  Thilo Kehrer was shown his second yellow card.
The visitors had  chances to level the game, with Monaco kee­per Radoslaw Majecki pulling  off a fine save at full stretch from Ludovic Blas, and the home side  held on to take all three points.
Rennes are ninth on 39 points  after their second consecutive league loss, in a week which also brought  defeat in the Coupe de France semi-final when they lost 1-0 at PSG on  Wednesday.
Elsewhere, Montpellier put distance between themselves and the relegation play-off spot with a 2-0 win at home to Lorient.
The win takes Montpellier to 13th place and six points clear of Lor­­i­ent in the play-off spot of 16th.
OGC Nice dropped further away from the Champions League spots with a 0-0 draw at Reims and Toulouse also played out a goalless draw at home to RC Strasbourg.
Goals in the final 15 minutes by Alexandre Lacazette, Malick Fofana and Gift Orban gave Olympique Lyonnais a 3-1 win at Nantes after they fell behind to Matthis Abline’s 16th-minute opener, leaving the hosts just two points above the relegation zone.

5,Poistogova-Guliyev set to lose  Olympic silver,MOSCOW: Ekaterina Poistogova-Guliyev looks set to lose her silver medal from the 800 metres at the London Olympics...,"MOSCOW: Ekaterina Poistogova-Guliyev looks set to lose her silver medal from the 800 metres at the London Olympics after being banned for four years for historic doping by the Russian Athletics Federation (RusAF).
The 33-year-old, who competed for Russia before switching allegiance to Turkey, had all of her results from July 2012 to Oct. 2014 voided after being found guilty of the use or attempted use of banned substances, RusAF said in a statement.
The punishment was for infractions in 2012 and 2013 and based on data from the Moscow anti-doping laboratory, the statement added.
Competing as Ekaterina Poistogova, she finished third in the 2012 Olympic final on Aug 12 but was upgraded to second when Russian winner Mariya Savinova was found guilty of doping offences.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) recommended that Poistogova-Guliyev be banned for life and have her London medal stripped in 2015 as the result of their investigations into state-sponsored systematic doping in Russian athletics.
Poistogova-Guliyev was eventually banned for two years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2017 but her results were voided only back to October 2015, allowing her to keep her Olympic medal.
The final decision on the stripping and reallocation of medals rests with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), who were not immediately available to comment.
If Poistogova-Guliyev is stripped of her medal, Kenyan Pamela Jelimo would be awarded the silver with American Alysia Montano taking the bronze.
The women’s middle distance events at the London Olympics were heavily tainted by doping with three runners in the 800m final since having their results voided — Savinova, Poistogova-Guliyev and sixth-placed Russian Elena Arzhakova.
Five of the 13 runners in the 1,500m final were also subsequently banned for doping offences.
Poistogova-Guliyev has been banned only until 2026 because allowance was given for the two-year ban she served after the CAS decision, RusAF said.

6,Juventus back in form with triumph over Fiorentina,TURIN: Juventus returned to winning ways after four league games without a victory thanks to a 1-0 success against...,"TURIN: Juventus returned to winning ways after four league games without a victory thanks to a 1-0 success against Fiorentina with a first-half goal from Federico Gatti to consolidate their hold on third place in Serie A on Sunday.
Juve now have 62 points, closing the gap with second-placed AC Milan to six and extending their lead over Bologna in fourth to four points. Inter Milan are top with 79 points and next face Udinese. Fiorentina are 10th on 43 points.
The hosts had three goals ruled out for offside in the opening half but took the lead in the 21st minute through Gatti, which turned out to be the winner.
Juventus were pushed harder after the break but held on for a second victory in 10 league games after they won their Coppa Italia semi-final, first leg 2-0 against Lazio in midweek.
“A very important victory after two very difficult months, we have a lot to play for and we have to be ready,” Gatti told DAZN.
Fiorentina enjoyed the lion’s share of possession early on, while the hosts looked more dangerous, twice finding the net in the opening 12 minutes with both efforts ruled out for offside.
Dusan Vlahovic, searching for his first goal against his former club, was furious about the second one as his header took a touch of his team-mate Bremer in an offside position.
It seemed only a matter of time before Juve broke the deadlock and after Bremer’s looping header from a corner came off the far post, Gatti was there to tap home from close range. 
Before the break, Cristiano Biraghi had Fiorentina’s first shot in anger, but his long-range effort was wide of the post.
“Too much respect for Juventus and too timid in the first half,” Fiore­ntina manager Vincenzo Italiano told DAZN.
Fiorentina improved after the break and were denied an equaliser when Nicolas Gonzalez curled a left-foot shot from outside the area which goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny managed to tip onto the crossbar with the ball headed for the top corner.
In the final minutes, the visitors had another chance but when substitute Lucas Beltran struck from close range his team mate M’Bala Nzola blocked the goal-bound effort and Juventus held on as Fiorentina’s awful away record in Turin continues.
The Viola have now lost 12 of their last 13 games at Juve.
“In the end we risked conceding an equaliser, we made a few mistakes but I can’t blame the lads for anything,” Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri said to DAZN. “We’re having a good season, we’re doing everything we can to try to improve. These three points are important.”
Earlier on Sunday, a trio of fantastic goals helped Napoli to a thrilling 4-2 win at Monza.
Trailing at half-time to Milan Djuric’s early header and loudly  barracked by protesting away fans, champions Napoli roared back to win  at Monza following sumptuous strikes from Victor Osimhen, Matteo  Politano and Piotr Zielinski in six second-half minutes.
Andrea  Colpani’s deflected shot clo­s­ed the gap to one, seconds after  Zielinski’s first goal since October, but Giacomo Raspadori added the  fourth in the 69th minute to ensure Napoli went seventh. Two points ahead of Nap­oli, in sixth, are Atalanta who fell to a  surprise 2-1 defeat at Cagliari but have a game in hand, against  Fiorentina.
Frosinone, who won Serie B last season, are a point  behind Hellas Verona who sit just outside the relegation zone after losing 2-1  to mid-table Genoa.

7,"Azhar Mahmood named head coach for New Zealand T20s, squad to be announced today",Member of the national selection committee Wahab Riaz will also accompany the Pakistan squad during the series.,"LAHORE/ISLAMA­BAD: Former Pakistan all-rounder Azhar Mahmood will be the national side’s head coach for the upcoming five-match Twenty20 International series against New Zealand, the country’s cricket board announced on Monday.
Azhar’s appointment, however, is a makeshift one, as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) continues its search for foreign coaches for long term roles in separate positions for white and red-ball formats.
Azhar, who featured in 164 matches for Pakistan, served the side as its bowling coach from 2016 to 2019. The New Zealand series will be his first assignment as the national team’s head coach.
The 49-year-old comes with rich experience of coaching in the T20 format, having led Pakistan Super League champions Islamabad United’s backroom staff since 2021 after stints as bowling coach with Karachi Kings and Multan Sultans.
The ex-pacer and right-handed batter will be assisted by former star Mohammad Yousuf — who is also one of the selectors — as batting coach, meanwhile Saeed Ajmal will carry out duties as the spin bowling coach. Aftab Khan has returned as Pakistan’s fielding coach.
Member of the national selection committee Wahab Riaz will also accompany the Pakistan squad during the series, but in an unusual role as a “senior” team manager in the presence of seasoned Mans­oor Rana, who has been appointed as the team manager.
Dawn understands Wahab’s role in the dressing room will be far from that of a team manager. He is, in fact, going to ensure the selection policies — which includes rotation of players and giving opportunities to younger players — are implemented smoothly.
The said policies were communicated during a meeting in Islamabad on Monday to the 29 Pakistan probables, who took part in the fitness boot camp that concluded on Sunday at the country’s military academy in Kakul.
In the meeting, “the selection committee took the players in confidence regarding the selection policy, which includes rotation policy and providing opportunities to new players”, said a PCB press release. The meeting was attended by all members of the selection committee, namely Abdul Razzaq, Asad Shafiq, Bilal Afzal, Hasan Cheema, Yousuf, Wahab and Usman Wahla.
Pakistan mainstay Mohammad Rizwan did not attend the meeting as he travelled to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage. The national side’s squad will be announced on Tuesday.
According to sources, there’s a high chance a number of less experienced players will be named in the Pakistan squad for the New Zealand series, with the BlackCaps, scheduled to land in Islamabad on April 14, depleted with seven of their top players absent due to their involvement in the ongoing Indian Premier League.
While veteran Imad Was­im and Mohammad Amir – who had rescinded their retirements recently — are set to be selected, Usman Khan , who gave up prospects to play for the United Arab Emirates, is highly likely to make it to the squad.
Shaheen Shah Afridi, who was ripped off Pakis­tan captaincy after just one series in charge to be replaced by former skipper Babar Azam, may also be rested as an attempt to manage the pacer’s workload.
The likes of young left-arm spinner Mehran Mumtaz, fast bowler Mohammad Ali, leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed and wicket-keeper Azam Khan could also be included.
After the series, Pakistan will travel to Ireland and England to feature in T20I series following which the team will travel to the United States and the West Indies to feature in the T20 World Cup.

8,Real looking for revenge against City in Champions League quarters,The Spanish giants also have a point to prove after being routed 4-0 by City.,"LONDON: Real Madrid v Manchester City. 
The all-time kings of Europe take on the current holders in the standout tie of the Champions League quarter-finals. 
For the third year running Real and City meet in a match-up in which the winner has gone on to lift the trophy in the past two seasons. And it would be difficult to look beyond either team going on to continue that streak this time around. 
City are still in contention for back-to-back trebles after winning the Premier League title, Cham­pions League and FA Cup last year. 
Real, reinvigorated by the signing of Jude Bellingham last summer, are eight points clear at the top of La Liga and aiming for a record-extending 15th European Cup title. 
The Spanish giants also have a point to prove after being routed 4-0 by City in the second leg of last year’s semi-finals. 
Then it was City who had a score to settle, having suffered a late collapse at the Santiago Bernabeu to crash out in the semi-finals in 2022. 
Manager Pep Guardiola will likely know how motivated Real will be to exact revenge — just as his players were last year — and that adds a subplot to a tie that is already heavy on intrigue. 
Real host City at the Bernabeu on Tuesday in a mouthwatering first-leg clash and Real manager Carlo Ancelotti admitted he was rather anxious about facing the reigning champions for a third year running. 
“I’m very nervous. The hours before the match, on a personal level,” Ancelotti told a news conference on Monday. “Is defeat suffering and victory, happiness? No, it’s really a relief. Because the days after are calmer. Suffering is part of the job, it keeps you alive, it’s fuel for me. 
“It will be an attractive football match, each team has its own characteristics, with a lot of quality in both teams. This quality will make for a very nice match on a technical level.” 
Elsewhere, Paris Saint-Germain versus Barcelona is another clash of heavyweights — the first leg of which will be played on Wedn­esday, with Kylian Mbappe aiming to finally lead the French champions to European club football’s elite trophy before walking away at the end of the season. 
Premier League title-chasing Arsenal take on a Bayern Munich team that is limping towards the end of a miserable campaign in the Bundesliga on Tuesday, while Atletico Madrid face Borussia Dortmund a day later. 
‘COURAGE AND PERSONALITY’ 
Real have all of their attacking players clicking. 
Bellingham has struck 20 goals in 32 games this season, including four in the Champions League. Vinicius Junior is peaking just in time to face City with five goals in his last three appearances. Brahim Diaz provides a spark off the bench. And Rodyrgo ended a six-week scoring drought in Madrid’s last game, a 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao, to keep it on course for winning the domestic league title. 
Real are on a 27-game unbeaten run at the Bernabeu across all competitions dating back to last April. 
Ancelotti said his team played without courage or personality when City knocked them out of the Champions League last season and called on his players to show more mental strength this time around. 
“We played without courage, without personality — courage and personality are fundamental in this type of game, we lacked them in the second leg,” Ancelotti said. 
“The important thing is to be at our best, the mental aspect is very important. In terms of courage and personality, we’ve had time to prepare for the game, we’ve prepared very well, and I am confident that we will give our best and we’ve got the quality to compete.” 
City have found their scoring form over the past week after hitting four goals in each of its games against Aston Villa and Crystal Palace to stay on the heels of title rivals Liverpool and Arsenal. 
ENRIQUE REUNION 
After a difficult start to his coaching career at PSG, when he had to put up with Mbappe’s bitter contract saga, Luis Enrique has steadily won over fans and the French media — even if it meant dropping Mbappe or taking him off in games. 
Enrique won the treble as Barcelona coach in 2015 with Lionel Messi in his team and is still in contention to do the same at PSG with Mbappe. 
Losing has become a distant memory for PSG, which is undefeated in 27 matches since a loss away to AC Milan in November during the Champions League group stage. But playing a rested Barcelona side could be the toughest test of the season. 
Xavi Hernandez attempted to shock his team into getting its act together by saying he would quit at the end of the season, something that has coincided with a certain improvement. 
Barca have gone unbeaten in 11 straight games since Xavi said in late January that he was renouncing the final year of his contract. 
Robert Lewandowski, teenager Lamine Yamal and Raphinha are all playing well of late, but the midfield is a big question mark due to injury concerns. 
TUCHEL TROUBLE 
Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel wants to end a “frustrating” season, and his tenure, on a high with a trip to Wembley for the Champions League final. But their preparation for Arsenal could hardly have been worse after its latest defeat, this time to Heidenheim on Saturday after leading 2-0. 
Two-time Champions League winner Thomas Mueller said his side could harness the frustration and unleash it on Tuesday. 
“This result has me in fighting mode,” Mueller said. “Self-pity doesn’t help us at all. The resentment inside me is smiling again.” 
The mood at Arsenal is very different with Mikel Arteta’s team looking better equipped to last the course in the race for the title this year after a late collapse last season. 
The Champions League run feels like an unexpected bonus, but victory against Bayern will strengthen belief that a trophy double could be on. 
“We are in a really good moment. We have the squad healthy, with a really good energy, with a lot of confidence individually and collectively,” Arteta said after Saturday’s Premier League win at Brighton & Hove Albion. “We just have to carry on doing what we’re doing.” 
ATLETICO SLUMP 
Atletico have slumped in recent weeks, with six losses and only four wins in their last 12 games overall, as they missed the goals and creativity of Antoine Griezmann. The France forward is now back playing and will be looking for his first goal since Jan 18. 
Diego Simeone’s side were enjoying a 25-game unbeaten run at its Metropolitano Stadium until Barca delivered a 3-0 rout at Atletico on March 27. 
Dortmund have generally saved their best for the Champions League this season but the Spanish side are the slight favorites and have an advantage of having 10 days without a game to prepare for the first leg at the Atletico’s Metropolitano Stadium. 
“It’s better for us to have longer time to prepare for such an important game,” Atletico central defender Stefan Savic admitted in the El Mundo Deportivo newspaper. “I don’t know if it’s better or not that the first game is at home, because if you do a good job in the first leg, it’s difficult for your rival to overturn the result later. The big thing is that we are at home now.”

9,Olympic medal production  on track,PARIS: The French national mint said on Monday that production of the medals for the Paris Olympic Games remained on...,"PARIS: The French national mint said on Monday that production of the medals for the Paris Olympic Games remained on track despite protests and stoppages by staff since last month.
Around 50 employees demonstrated in front of the mint’s central Paris headquarters on Monday, claiming that stoppages over the last fortnight had  “blocked production” of the medals ahead of the start of the Games on July 26.
“Production of the medals is not blocked,” the mint said in a statement.
“All medals have been minted and we are at finishing stage. We will del­i­v­er on schedule and on time.”
Protesting staff, represented by trade unions, want an  “Olympics bonus” which is being paid to other state employees such as police officers and nurses who will have to work over the Olympics and Paral­ympics in July-August.
Management of the mint have refused bonuses and are negotiating annual pay rises for their 430 staff, who are responsible for producing the roughly 5,000 gold, silver and bronze medals to be used during the Games.
The Paris 2024 medals are made from recycled metal and will each contain a small hexagon-shaped medallion cut from discarded metal from the original Eiffel Tower.

Mondo claim the track delivers better performance than the one used at the Covid-delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics, whe­re three world records were broken, including the men’s and women’s 400m hurdles marks set by Karsten Warholm and Sydney McLaughlin-Levr­one respectively.
“We have changed the design of the cells on the lower layer of the track compared to the one used in Tokyo,” Maurizio Stroppiana, vice-president of Mondo’s sports division, told AFP.
“That reduces the energy loss for athletes and sends it back up to them at the best possible point of their movement.”
However research and development manager Andrea Marenghi says that Mondo cannot  “do whatever we want” with the composition of the track.
“There are very strict criteria set by the IOC because the most important thing is to safeguard the health of the athlete and not impair their technique,” says Marenghi.
“Athletes are more high-performance than ever, and the track doesn’t give anything that they don’t already have.”
The Paris track will be a striking purple rather than the traditional terracotta.
Marenghi told AFP that the two new shades — one for the competition areas and another for the technical areas — will only be used for the Games in Paris.

11,French charity sounds alarm about Seine ahead of Olympics,"In an open letter, the charity said it “wanted to share with stakeholders its rising concerns about the quality of the Seine"".","PARIS: A French water charity sounded the alarm on Monday about pollution in the Seine just over 100 days before the start of the Olympics when the river is set to be used for swimming events.
Surfrider Foundation said it had analysed six months of tests over winter undertaken by a laboratory and had concluded that the river water remained polluted and potentially dangerous.
In an open letter, the Biarritz-based charity said it  “wanted to share with stakeholders its rising concerns about the quality of the Seine but also the risks faced by athletes moving in contaminated water.”
Paris authorities are in a race against time to clean up the Seine before the start of the Olympics on July 26, with the famed waterway set to play a starring role during the Games.
It is expected to host the opening ceremony, and will then be used for the marathon swimming events and the triathlon — pollution permitting.
Cleaning up the Seine has been promoted as one the key legacy achievements of the Paris 2024 Games, with mayor Anne Hidalgo intending to create three public bathing areas in the river next year.
She and President Emmanuel Macron have also promised to take a dip before the Games to demonstrate it is safe — just over a century since public swimming was banned there in 1923.
Around 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) has been spent upgrading sewage and storm water treatment facilities to reduce the amount of untreated faecal matter flowing into the river and its main tributary, the Marne.
Marc Guillaume, the top state security official for Paris, attacked Surfrider’s  “very poor knowledge of this issue”, adding:  “There’s no point doing tests today in the Seine and comparing them with what will happen next summer.”
Surfrider said the tests had been carried out by the laboratory Eau de Paris and environmental analysis group Analy-Co from September to March underneath the bridges Alexandre-III and l’Alma, where the Olympic swimming is set to take place.
European water quality standards and the international triathlon and open-water swimming federations set limits on the concentration of two bacteria — E. Coli and enterococci -- which are indicators of the presence of faecal matter.
Out of 14 rounds of testing, only one had shown  “satisfactory” results, Surfrider said.
Overall, the testing had shown  “alarming” levels often double and sometimes three times higher than the maximum permitted amounts. One reading showed E.Coli at seven times the maximum level.
Paris authorities stressed that the samples were taken over the winter period — and one of the wettest winters in 30 years.
Heavy rainfall is known to overwhelm Paris’ more than century-old sewage system, leading to direct discharges into the river of untreated effluent.
“The first quarter of 2024 saw extremely large rainfall (250 000 ml over three months, double the level of 2023) which deteriorated the quality of the water,” the Paris prefect’s office said in a statement.
Furthermore, water disinfection facilities were not working over winter and would be started ahead of the Olympics.
“There has never been question of opening the Seine for swimming all year round,” Guillaume added.
A giant new underground storm water facility is expected to be inaugurated later this month in southeast Paris, while the last sewage connections for river boats in the centre of the capital are currently being completed.
Cleaning up the Seine had been  “probably the most difficult (Olympic) project to organise,” deputy Paris mayor Emmanuel Gregoire told reporters last Friday.
Three Olympic test events in the Seine were cancelled last July and August due to elevated E. Coli readings.
The disruption was blamed on very heavy rainfall and a faulty sewer valve which led to dirty water being discharged into the river.
Last month, Brazilian swimmer Ana Marcela Cunha, the reigning Olympic open water champion, called on Paris to have a plan B in case the Seine was not ready.
Organisers say they are able to delay the swimming events in the event of heavy rainfall, but they do not intend to move them.
Olympic open-water swimming has been hit by pollution concerns in the past.
At the end of the test event in 2019 ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, swimmers protested against the quality of the water in Tokyo Bay.
At the Rio Olympics in 2016, the prospect of swimming in the polluted Guanabara Bay also made headlines.
