0,PTI slams jail staff for not allowing Imran’s check-up,Core committee terms complaint against IHC’s Justice Kayani part of govt’s efforts to intimidate judges.,"• Party’s core committee terms complaint against IHC’s Justice Kayani part of govt’s efforts to intimidate judges
• KP CM’s aide sees no sign of recovery from ‘worst economic crisis’
ISLAMABAD: Pakist­­an Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) core committee has criticised the Adiala Jail ad­­ministration for not allowing Dr Asim to conduct medical check-up of PTI founding chairman Imran Khan and urged that court take its im­­mediate notice.
The committee emphasised that Dr Asim should be allowed to conduct Mr Khan’s medical examination.
It condemned the complaint filed against Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, a judge of the Islamabad High Court, in the  Supreme Judicial Council.
The panel said the misconduct complaint against Justice Kayani was part of the government’s ongoing efforts to intimidate and coerce judges.
It said the complaint of misconduct against a judge after sending toxic letters to judges who had complained of interference by spy agencies in judicial affairs was part of an organised campaign against the judiciary.
The forum urged Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faiz Isa to take notice of incidents of harassment of judges directly and indirectly to expose the people behind an ‘organised campaign’ against judges and the judiciary.
The committee said the PTI had decided to boycott ‘unconstitutional elections’ for the slots of chairman and deputy chairman of the Senate.
Economic crisis
Meanwhile, adviser to KP chief minister on finance Muzzammil Aslam has said the country is facing the worst-ever economic crisis, with no sign of recovery.
He criticised the government for crushing the people under the burden of back-breaking inflation.
He said that on April 9, 2022, a no-confidence motion was moved against the PTI government over allegations of inflation because the PTI government had put the economy on the path of rapid recovery despite Covid-19 pandemic that played havoc across the world.
The adviser said that in the last year of the PTI government, remittances and exports were at an all-time high, but all hard-earned gains were reversed due to the no-confidence motion against the PTI government.
Mr Muzzammil said the recent World Bank report had revealed that another 10 million Pakistanis would fall below the poverty line.

3,Three brothers get bail in Lahore’s Jinnah House attack case,"Judicial remand of Aliya, Sanam extended in police station attack case.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday granted post-arrest bail to three brothers in the  Lahore Corps Commander House (Jinnah House) attack case. 
A two-judge bench, headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, allowed the petitions of Faizan, Wali and Waqas.
Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq appeared on behalf of the petitioners and argued that police arrested them without any evidence. He said the petitioners were not even present on the alleged occurrence. He said the police could not produce any evidence against the petitioners.
The counsel argued that the petitioners were behind bars for several months without any conviction.
A deputy prosecutor opposed the bail petitions, saying the presence of the suspects at Jinnah House was established through their mobile phones. 

Judicial remand of Aliya, Sanam extended in police station attack case

He said since challan of the case had been submitted to the trial court, the suspects did not deserve bail at this stage. The bench ordered the suspects to furnish bail bonds of Rs100,000 each for their release.
Sarwar Road police had registered a case against the leaders and activists of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf for attacking and ransacking the Jinnah House during the May 9 riots.
During the last two months, over 200 activists, including women, had been granted bail in the Jinnah House attack case by different courts.
Besides terrorism charge under Section 7 of the Anti-terrorism Act 1997, various offences including waging or attempting to wage a war or abetting waging of war against Pakistan, abetting mutiny, or attempting to seduce a soldier from his duty and rioting were added in the FIR.
Judicial remand extended
An anti-terrorism court on Monday extended the judicial remand of PTI’s former MNA Aliya Hamza Malik and social media activist Sanam Javed in Shadman police station attack case.
The police brought both women from Sargodha jail to Lahore’s court for proceedings.
Judge Arshad Javed extended the judicial remand of the women for another 14 days and police took them back to jail.
The judge also adjourned a case of torching police vehicles in the cantonment area against the two women and other leaders of the PTI, including Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Dr Yasmin Rashid and Mian Mahmoodur Rashid.
The suspects had been indicted in this case with the testimony of four prosecution witnesses recorded so far.
The judge postponed three more May 9 cases against the PTI leaders and workers till April 25.

4,Delicate Eid bangles go from furnace to forearms,Soaring gas prices have forced many factories in Hyderabad to close,"HYDERABAD: Layers of intricately decorated bangles are a staple fashion accessory for women in Pakistan, a carefully considered part of their Eidul Fitr celebrations.
More than a dozen people can be involved in the making of a single bangle, from sweltering factories to the homes of designers who skilfully decorate them by hand.
“Whatever the fashion trends, when we attend any event and wear any outfit it feels incomplete without bangles,” said 42-year-old Talat Zahid, who uses beads, stitching and embroidery to embellish bangles.
“Even if you don’t wear jewellery but wear bangles or a bracelet with your outfit, the outfit looks complete.” In the lead-up to this week’s Eidul Fitr festivities that mark the end of Ramazan, market stalls are adorned with a glittering array of colourful bangles, each turned over and inspected for their beauty and imperfections by women who haggle for a good price.

Soaring gas prices have forced many factories in Hyderabad to close

They are often sold by the dozen, starting at around Rs150 (about 50 cents) and rising to Rs1,000 as stones and silk are added.
Hyderabad is home to the delicate “churi” glass bangle, where a single furnace can produce up to 100 bangles an hour from molten glass wire shaped around an iron rod.
The work is arduous and frustrating — labourers are exposed to oppressive temperatures in unregulated factories prone to frequent power cuts, while the fragile glass threads can snap easily.
“The work is done without a fan. If we turn on the fan the fire is extinguished. So the heat intensity is high. As it becomes hotter our work slows down,” said 24-year-old Sameer, who followed his father into the industry and earns less than the minimum wage of Rs32,000 ($115) a month.
After the partition of British-ruled India in 1947, migrating Muslims who had produced bangles in the Indian city of Firozabad took their trade to Hyderabad -- where hundreds of thousands of people rely on the industry.
But soaring gas prices after the government slashed subsidies have forced many factories to close or to operate at reduced hours.
“The speed at which the government has increased the gas prices and taxes, (means) the work in this area has started to shrink instead of expand,” said 50-year-old factory owner Muhammad Nafees.
Most bangles leave the factory as plain loops, sent off to be embellished to different degrees by women who work from home, before they’re finally passed on to traders to be sold in markets.
The production is often a family affair.
Saima Bibi, 25, works from home, carefully adding stones to bangles with the help of her three children when they return from school, while her husband works at the furnaces.
“They go through a lot of hands to be prepared,” she said.

5,"US calls upon Pakistan, India not to escalate tensions","Says it does not have ""any comments on underlined allegations"" of Indian agents carrying out killings in Pakistan.","WASHINGTON: The US State Department urged India and Pakistan on Monday not to escalate tensions and resolve their disputes through dialogue.
“We have been following the media reports about this issue,” said the department’s spokesperson Matthew Miller when asked to comment on media reports that Indian government agents had carried out assassinations inside Pakistan.
“We don’t have any comment on the underlined allegations.”
 
 

The US official, however, said that while Washington was not going to “get in the middle of this situation”, it would “encourage both sides to avoid escalation and find a resolution through dialogue”.
Britain’s The Guardian newspaper reported last week that the Indian government had “assassinated individuals in Pakistan as part of a wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil”.
In a later report, the newspaper noted that India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, in a recent statement, confirmed that his government carried out extrajudicial killings in Pakistan.
Responding to another question, Mr Miller said the US secretary of state spoke with Pakistan’s foreign minister on Friday to “reaffirm our robust partnership which advances the prosperity of Pakistan and the US.”
The two diplomats discussed the importance of continued cooperation on counterterrorism, ex­­panding trade and investment partnership, and advancing women’s economic security and empowerment, Mr Miller added.

7,Plea against election of Senate heads admitted for hearing,Five PTI senators tell IHC April 9 election cannot take place as the house is not complete,"ISLAMABAD: Five PTI senators on Monday challenged the election of chairman and deputy chairman of the upper house of parliament scheduled to be held today (Tuesday) and the Islamabad High Court (IHC) admitted their petition for regular hearing. 
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq took up the petition filed by Dr Zarqa Suharwardy Taimur, Falak Naz, Fawzia Arshad, Saifullah Sarwar Khan Nyazee and Saifullah Abro. 
The petitioners’ counsel informed the court that the election process involves secret balloting, with members casting votes for candidates contesting from their respective provinces. 
It said that election to 11 seats of the Senate having fallen vacant in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province had been postponed for the reason that the members of the KP Assembly, purportedly elected on the reserved as provided under Article 106 of the constitution, had not taken the oath and thus the electoral college was incomplete. 

Five PTI senators tell IHC April 9 election cannot take place as the house is not complete

The election for the reserved seats in the KP Assembly was to be held on April 2, the petition said, adding that “it has been widely reported that a session of an “incomplete” Senate has been summoned on April 9 to hold elections of chairman and deputy chairman.  
It may be noted that election to the 11 seats of Senate from KP was postponed after the speaker refused to administer oath to those who had been declared returned candidates to reserved seats of the provincial legislature leaving the house. 
According to the PTI senators’ petition, the election to the office of chairman and deputy chairman Senate cannot be held in the absence of members from KP. 
“Under Article 60 of the Cons­titution, the election to the offices of Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Senate can only be held after the Senate has been duly constituted,” the petition pointed out. 
The petition requested the court to postpone the elections of chairman and deputy chairman till the house is complete. 
After preliminary hearing, Justice Farooq held that the petition was maintainable.
However, he said the court would seek assistance to determine if it has jurisdiction to interfere in such matters or not. 
The court issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Senate Secretariat and adjourned hearing. 
The ECP had earlier denied the reserved seats to the PTI-Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) and the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.  
Moved by SIC Chairman Sahibzada Mohammad Hamid Raza, the petition before the Supreme Court seeks the setting aside of the Peshawar High Court’s March 14 judgement that had upheld the ECP’s direction. 
The SIC was earlier joined by the PTI-backed independent candidates after they won the Feb 8 elections, since Imran Khan’s party had been deprived of its electoral symbol ‘bat’.

8,Competition Commission of Pakistan to assess impact of public investment companies on sector,Study also aims to evaluate the government’s footprint on key sectors through state-owned ente­r­­p­rises.,"ISLAMABAD: The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has commenced a study rega­rding the assessment of the insurance sector.
The study will evaluate whether public sector insurance companies were hindering the gro­wth of insurance market in the country.
The study, being conducted under IMF’s Public Investment Management Assessment framework, aims to evaluate the government’s footprint on key sectors through state-owned ente­r­­p­rises and its implications for competition and the overall economic landscape.
It will also examine the role of SOEs in insurance and reinsurance markets and analyse why this sector is underdeveloped. It will also examine how the market can be opened up to international players.
Privatising state-owned insurance firms is desirable to diminish public sector dominance, attract foreign investment and create a level playing field for the private sector to boost insurance penetration.
