0,Russians take to the streets in flooded city,Record floods in Urals triggered by melting snow,"MOSCOW: Russia on Monday warned of  “unprecedented” flooding over the next 48 hours as locals in a city partially submerged by rising waters took to the streets in rare protest at the authorities’ handling of the crisis.
Fast-melting ice and torrential rain have caused major rivers — the Ural and Tobol — near the Russian border with Kazakhstan to overflow, with officials warning the flood waters are set to rise dangerously high over the next 48 hours.
Dozens of protestors in the city of Orsk, which was submerged in metres of flood water over the weekend after a dam burst, on Monday protested against the government’s weak response in a rare show of dissent in Russia.
Videos posted by local social media channels showed the crowds shouting,  “Shame! Shame! Shame!” and  “Putin, help!” The Kremlin earlier on Monday said that the Russian president had no plans to visit the flooded areas. Public demonstrations against the government are illegal in Russia under strict anti-protest laws.

Record floods in Urals triggered by melting snow

The Orenburg regional prosecutor’s office, which covers Orsk, explicitly on Monday warned residents that they faced arrest if they participated in  “unauthorised” rallies.
The protesters were demanding more financial help and were angry that a dam designed to protect the city had burst.
In a compensation scheme published over the weekend, the regional government said it would pay up to 100,000 roubles ($1,100) per person for household items  “completely destroyed” in the floods. The Orenburg governor on Monday said that it would fully reimburse the cost of damage to housing, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported.
‘Do not wait’
In Orsk, the worst affected city so far, 99 people were treated for injuries with nine people admitted to hospital, state media cited health officials as saying. More cities, including the regional hub of Orenburg with a population of 550,000, were bracing for a surge in water levels over the coming days. Governors in the neighbouring 
regions of Kurgan and Tyumen each introduced a state of emergency.
“The flood forecast is rapidly deteriorating, much more water is arriving, and faster,” Vadim Shumkov, the governor of the Kurgan region said in a post on Telegram. He called on people to evacuate while they still could.
“Everyone who lives in settlements along the floodplain of the Tobol River: evacuate. Do not wait for the water to come. It will come at night and unexpectedly, quickly arriving in the form of a large wave,” Shumkov said in a post on Telegram.
The regional capital, also called Kurgan, is home to 300,000 people and sits on the river.
Water levels were receding in Orsk on Monday but had risen close to dangerous levels in the city of Orenburg. The Kremlin called the situation  “critical” and said it would likely  “worsen”.
“Nature has caused a lot of inconvenience. But the local residents are handling it stoically, as are the local authorities,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, hours before the protests in Orsk. Thousands of people have been evacuated from flooded areas.
The Emergency Situations ministry on Monday said that more than 10,000 residential buildings had been flooded, mostly in the Urals, Volga area and western Siberia.

1,27 go on trial in Panama Papers tax evasion case,"Leaked trove of 11.5m files from a law firm implicated influential figures, including billionaires, politicians and sports stars.","PANAMA CITY: Twenty-seven people went on trial on Monday in connection with the  “Panama Papers” tax evasion scandal, with one of the main defendants denying accusations of money laundering.
The 2016 leaks revealed how many of the world’s wealthy stashed assets in offshore companies, exposing high-profile personalities and triggering scores of investigations around the globe.
The defendants on trial include Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca Mora, the founders of the now-defunct law firm at the centre of the scandal, as well as other lawyers and former employees.
They are charged with money laundering and if convicted face up to 12 years in prison.

Leaked trove of 11.5m files from a law firm implicated influential figures, including billionaires, politicians and sports stars

Mossack, 76, said at the hearing that he was  “not responsible” for alleged crimes.
Earlier he told journalists outside the court he was  “very optimistic” and that  “if there is real justice” then he would be cleared.
Defence lawyer Dionicio Rodriguez said the case was  “a trial against the Panamanian legal profession” because  “activities are being prosecuted that are legal in many other countries in the world.” Fonseca, 71, did not attend because he was in the hospital, according to his lawyer.
The leaked trove of 11.5 million files from the law firm Mossack Fonseca implicated influential figures including billionaires, politicians and even sports stars.
Icelandic prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson was forced to resign after it was revealed his family had offshore accounts. Others implicated included former British premier David Cameron, football star Lionel Messi, Argentina’s then-president Mauricio Macri and Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar, to name but a few.
The files were leaked to a German newspaper, Sueddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Many of those caught up in the scandal put forward reasons to explain their offshore presence and said they did not act illegally. Even so, Mossack Fonseca said in 2018 that it would close due to  “irreparable damage” to its reputation.
‘More action needed’
The scandal dealt a severe blow to Panama’s image as an offshore financial hub. The country subsequently carried out legal reforms that led to its removal from the Financial Action Task Force’s  “gray list” of jurisdictions under increased monitoring.
The Paris-based organisation decided that Panama had made progress in the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing. But the Central American nation remains on a European Union tax haven blacklist.
“Eight years later, changes are happening, but more action is needed,” Olga de Obaldia, executive director of Transparency Inter­national in Panama, said.
The fact that some of its current laws against money laundering did not exist when the Panama Papers revelations emerged could complicate efforts to achieve convictions, according to legal experts.
“The crux of the matter is whether a crime was committed in Panama or not under the regulations at the time,” Carlos Barsallo, a jurist and former head of Transparency International’s Panama office, said.
According to Barsallo, in 2021 the Supreme Court exonerated a Mossack Fonseca employee by indicating that her actions at that time were not a crime in Panama.
“It may generate confusion and frustration in the international community if this is the outcome after so many years and so much news,” he said.

2,Vatican opposes criminalisation  of homosexuality,"Under Pope Francis, the Catholic Church has become more welcoming towards LGBT people.","VATICAN CITY: The Vatican opposes the criminalisation of homosexuality as practised by a number of countries with the support of Catholic groups, the head of the Vatican’s doctrine office said on Monday.
Presenting a publication which reaffirmed the Vatican’s opposition to sex changes, gender theory and surrogate parenthood, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez called laws punishing homosexuality  “a big problem” and said:  “of course we are not in favour of criminalisation.” 
Fernandez, a liberal theologian whom Pope Francis appointed as head of the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith less than a year ago, told reporters it was  “painful” to see some Catholics support anti-homosexuality laws.
In February 2023, returning from a trip to Africa where same-sex relationships are often taboo, Pope Francis said laws criminalising LGBT people were a sin and an injustice, because God loves and accompanies people with same-sex attraction.
“The criminalisation of homosexuality is a problem that cannot be ignored,” the pope said, citing unnamed statistics according to which 50 countries criminalise LGBT people  “in one way or another” and about 10 others have laws including the death penalty.
Under Pope Francis, the Catholic Church has become more welcoming towards LGBT people. In December, Cardinal Fernandez’s office issued a landmark document allowing the blessing of same-sex couples, triggering substantial conservative backlash.
Nevertheless, the Church officially teaches that homosexual acts  “are intrinsically disordered”.
Answering a question on whether such language may be amended, Cardinal Fernandez said,  “it is true that it a very strong expression and that it needs a lot of explanation, perhaps we could find a clearer one.”
He said that the point of Catholic teaching was that homosexual acts cannot match  “the immense beauty” of heterosexual unions, and the Church  “could find more apt words to express” this.

3,Italy claims arresting Tajik ‘IS’ fighter,ROME: Italian police said on Monday they had arrested a Tajikistan citizen who went to fight in Syria ten years ago...,"ROME: Italian police said on Monday they had arrested a Tajikistan citizen who went to fight in Syria ten years ago and is still an active member of the militant Islamic State group.
Born in 1992, the man — identified only by the initials S.I. — had been on the run and used various aliases and nationalities, including claiming to be from Uzbekistan, Kyrgystan and Ukraine.
He was arrested at Rome’s Fiumicino airport after arriving on a flight from Eindhoven in the Netherlands on Monday morning, police said in a statement. He had been subject to an international arrest warrant.
His arrest was part of broader  “preventive” action by Italian authorities, police said, noting also the  “extreme delicacy of the current international background”.
They did not elaborate, nor did they give further details about how he was tracked down, although Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi highlighted the importance of working with police in other countries.
In a statement, Piantedosi hailed the arrest as a  “very important result” by law enforcement authorities working to  “counter the terrorist threat”.

4,Muslims face dwindling representation in India under Modi,"Ziya Us Salam, author of a book on Muslims in India, says members of the faith had for decades placed their trust in secular parties.","RAMPUR: More than half the voters in the Indian city of Rampur are Muslim, but its member of parliament is a staunch supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s muscular Hindu-first agenda.
It is a situation repeated across Hindu-majority India, where many consider victory for Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in upcoming general elections a near certainty — and see Muslim candidates as a recipe for defeat at the ballot box.
While India’s 220 million Muslims make up a little under a fifth of its 1.4 billion population, Muslim representatives in parliament have almost halved to less than five per cent since the 1970s.
“Everyone wants a connect with BJP,” said Ghanshyam Singh Lodhi, who is confident of re-election as MP for Rampur in Uttar Pradesh state when the six-week-long elections begin on April 19.
Lodhi, a Hindu, replaced Rampur’s Muslim MP in a 2022 by-election, jumping ship from the last lawmaker’s party to become a BJP loyalist.
Muslim leaders worry at the lack of representation. There were just 27 Muslim MPs in the 543-seat lower house in parliament — and none of them were among the BJP’s 310 lawmakers.
Ziya Us Salam, author of a book on Muslims in India, says members of the faith had for decades placed their trust in secular parties, a process that created an  “acute absence of Muslim leadership”.
Today, an overtly Muslim leader would be challenged as stoking sectarian divisions, yet few question when Modi champions constitutionally secular India as a  “Hindu Rashtra”, or Hindu state. “Nobody talks of (Modi) being the leader of only Hindus,” Salam said.
He also argues that successive gerrymandering policies since independence in 1947 have redrawn electoral boundaries to split areas with substantial Muslim populations.
‘Not able to vote’
Rampur has elected Muslim MPs 15 out of 18 times since 1952. But Kanwal Bharti, a 71-year-old activist and writer from the city, said the BJP’s dominance means that it  “doesn’t seem possible anymore” for a Muslim candidate to win Rampur.
Rampur’s last Muslim MP was veteran politician Mohammad Azam Khan — but he quit after more than 80 legal cases were brought against him, ranging from land grabbing to intimidating government officials.
His supporters said many of the accusations were years old and that charges had only been belatedly brought after the BJP won state elections in 2017. Khan was jailed for three years in 2023 for hate speech against BJP rivals.
Past elections were marred by allegations that security forces blocked Muslims from voting.
A legal challenge that a 2022 parliamentary by-election vote was manipulated  “by using every unconstitutional means” to stop voters from Muslim-dominated areas was dismissed on a technicality.
Some Muslim voters in Rampur worry about casting a ballot later this month.
“If the conditions during the last election are repeated, I will again not be able to vote,” said 75-year-old Mohammad Salam Khan, reading a newspaper in his son’s electrical repair shop.

5,"Swapping of the Guard: French, British troops mark Entente Cordiale",LONDON: French and British troops on Monday swapped roles to take part in changing of the guard ceremonies outside...,"LONDON: French and British troops on Monday swapped roles to take part in changing of the guard ceremonies outside the palaces of the other country’s head of state, in an unprecedented move to celebrate 120 years since the Entente Cordiale. Signed in 1904, the Entente Cordiale accord cemented an improvement in relations after the Napoleonic Wars and is seen as the foundation of the two Nato members’ alliance to this day.
Even after Brexit and with war back in Europe,  “this entente cordiale is somehow the cornerstone... that allows us to maintain the bilateral relationship”, French President Emmanuel Macron said in a video address on X, formerly Twitter.
“Long live the entente cordiale and long live the Franco-British friendship,” he said, switching to English. Macron and British ambassador to France Menna Rawlings on Monday morning watched British guards taking part in the changing of the guard outside his Elysee Palace.
French guards then did the same in London outside Buckingham Palace, the official residence of King Charles III.
At the Elysee, 16 members of the Number 7 Company Coldstream Guards of the UK embassy, wearing their traditional bearskin hats, relieved French counterparts from the first infantry regiment. The French army choir then sang the two national anthems — God Save the King and La Marseillaise.
British Foreign Minister David Cameron and his French counterpart, Stephane Sejourne, celebrated their countries’  “close friendship” in a joint op-ed published late on Sunday. 
They said it was key at a time when Nato is mobilised to ensure Ukraine does not lose its fight to repel the Russian invasion.

6,N. America sees first total solar eclipse in 7 years,MAZATLAN: The first total solar eclipse to grace North America in seven years made landfall in Mexico on Monday as...,"

THESE photos, taken in Mazatlan (Mexico), Fort Worth (Texas) and Bloomington (Indiana) — along the so-called ‘Path of Totality’ — show the stages of the total solar eclipse that was visible in parts of North America, on Monday.—Reuters / AFP

 
MAZATLAN: The first total solar eclipse to grace North America in seven years made landfall in Mexico on Monday as millions of skywatchers gazed upward for the start of a celestial display at least partially visible, weather permitting, across most of the continent. 
The Mexican beachside resort town of Mazatlan was the first major viewing spot along the “path of totality” in North America. 
Thousands of people gathered along the coastal promenade, setting themselves up in deck chairs with solar-safe eyewear as an orchestra played the “Star Wars” movie theme. The crowds burst into cheers and applause and the eclipse reached totality. 
Where clear skies prevail, observers along the direct path of the eclipse were being treated to the rare spectacle of the moon appearing as a dark orb creeping in front of the sun, briefly blocking out all but a brilliant halo of light, or corona, around, the sun’s outer edge. 
The period of totality, lasting up to 4 1/2 minutes depending the observer’s location, was ushered in by a number of other eerie eclipse effects. A partial eclipse, in which the moon obscures only a portion of the sun, was unfolding across most of the continental United States. At Mazatlan, Lourdes Corro, 43, traveled 10 hours by car to get there.
“The last one I saw was when I was 9 years old,” Corro said. “There are a few clouds but we can still see the sun.” 
Eclipse fans are gathering in numerous places along the “path of totality,” which stretches from Mexico’s Pacific Coast through Texas and across 14 other US states into Canada. 
In upstate New York, at the Frontier Town campground in North Hudson, children ran around wearing eclipse T-shirts, while parents set up tables, chairs and beer coolers. 
Connecticut residents Bob and Teresa Love were stretched out in the cargo bed of their pickup truck, eating pastries and hoping the forecasted clouds hold off long enough to not obscure the spectacle. 
“I’m trying not to get too excited because of weather, just trying to keep expectations real,” said Teresa, 49. “Some people say it’s life-changing. I don’t know if it’s going to be life-changing, but I think it’s going to be cool to see.” 
At up to 4 minutes and 28 seconds, the total eclipse of 2024 surpasses the duration of the one that traversed the United States from coast to coast in 2017. That one clocked in at up to two minutes and 42 seconds. According to NASA, total eclipses can last anywhere from 10 seconds to about 7-1/2 minutes. 
Some other cities along the path of totality include: San Antonio, Austin and Dallas, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Cleveland, Ohio; Erie, Pennsylvania; both Niagara Falls, New York, and Niagara Falls, Ontario, site of the famed waterfall, and Montreal, Quebec. 
About 32 million people in the US live within the path of totality, with federal officials predicting another five million people will travel to be there. Countless eclipse-watching events were being convened at bars, stadiums, fairgrounds and parks along the path of totality. 
Small rural towns bustled, such as Advance, Missouri, home to just over 1,300 people, where Tim and Gwen Wurst had driven from their Kansas City home after checking weather forecasts. They had thrilled to witness a partial eclipse in 2017 and were excited for totality. 
“It’s been on the calendar for years,” said Tim Wurst, 62. “It was very dusky and dim the last eclipse, but this one should be just all-out dark.” 
Experts urge the use of protective solar glasses to prevent eye damage that would otherwise occur from starting directly at the sun. Only during the few minutes of totality can the sun can be safely viewed without such eyewear, they said.
Overcast skies are among an eclipse-chaser’s worst fears. The US National Weather Services forecast as of Monday morning was for “a rapid untimely increase of clouds” in Southern Texas; less worrying “high thin clouds” for a swathe from Arkansas to the Midwest; and the clearest skies in northern New England.

7,"Germany, Nicaragua trade barbs at Gaza genocide case",Managua seeks to halt arms exports to Israel at World Court.,"THE HAGUE: Nicaragua and Germany crossed swords at the UN’s top court on Monday, with Managua saying Berlin was  “pathetic” to supply aid to Gazans while also providing Israel with weapons, a case the top German lawyer dismissed as  “grossly biased”.
Nicaragua has hauled Germany before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to demand judges impose emergency measures to stop Berlin from providing Israel with weapons and other assistance.
Lawyers for Nicaragua argued Germany is in breach of the 1948 United Nations Genocide Convention, set up in the wake of the Holocaust, by furnishing Israel with weapons.
“It is indeed a pathetic excuse to the Palestinian children, women and men to provide humanitarian aid, including through airdrops, on the one hand and to furnish the military equipment that is used to kill and annihilate them... on the other hand,” Daniel Mueller, a lawyer for Nicaragua, told the court.
Nicaragua’s ambassador to the Netherlands, Carlos Jose Arguello Gomez, told the court:  “Germany seems not to be able to differentiate between self-defence and genocide.” Nicaragua asked the ICJ to decide  “provisional measures” — emergency orders imposed while the court considers the broader case.

Managua seeks to halt arms exports to Israel at World Court

“Germany was and is fully conscious of the risk that the arms it has furnished and continues to furnish to Israel” could be used to commit a genocide, said Alain Pellet, a lawyer for Nicaragua. “It is extremely urgent that Germany finally suspend” such aid, he added.
Germany will respond fully in court on Tuesday but has already hit back at the allegations. Its top lawyer, Tania von Uslar-Gleichen, said Nicaragua’s case was  “grossly biased”.
“Germany completely rejects the accusations. We never did violate the Genocide Convention nor international humanitarian law either directly nor indirectly,” she told reporters.
“On the contrary, Germany is committed to the upholding of international law and this is what we work for internationally.” 
‘Unjustified decision’
The ICJ was set up to rule in disputes between nations and has become a key player in the crisis erupted after the October 7 raid.
In a separate case, South Africa has accused Israel of perpetrating genocide in the Gaza Strip, charges Israel vehemently denies.
In that case, the court ordered Israel to do everything in its power to prevent genocidal acts and recently toughened its stance, ordering additional measures obliging Israel to step up access to humanitarian aid.
The court’s rulings are binding but it lacks an enforcement mechanism. For example it has ordered Russia to stop its invasion of Ukraine, to no avail.
Nicaragua has requested five provisional measures, including that Germany  “immediately suspend its aid to Israel, in particular its military assistance including military equipment”.
It also calls on the court to order Germany to  “reverse its decision to suspend the funding of UNRWA”.
Germany said in January it was halting funding pending an investigation into Israeli accusations that several staff at the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees took part in the October 7 raid.
“This unjustified decision contributes to the suffering in Gaza where children women and men are starving,” Mueller told the court.
Nicaragua said in its submission that  “it could be comprehensible” that Germany would support an  “appropriate reaction” by ally Israel to the October 7 Hamas raid.
“But this cannot be an excuse for acting in violation of international law,” it said.
Mueller explained that Nicaragua was going after Germany instead of Israel’s main ally, the United States, because Washington does not recognise the court’s jurisdiction.
On Friday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Israel had  “no more excuse” to delay aid getting into Gaza. The United Nations has warned of  “catastrophic” hunger in the densely populated, besieged Palestinian territory.

8,UN Security Council begins review of Palestinian bid for full UN membership,"The council’s move was described as “historic” by the Palestinians, but angrily denounced by Israel.","UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations Security Council said on Monday that it would decide this month on the Palestinians’ bid for full UN membership, with the longshot campaign unlikely to survive US opposition.
As the Gaza war rages on into its seventh month, the council’s move was described as  “historic” by the Palestinians, but angrily denounced by Israel.
Maltese Ambassador Vanessa Frazier, who holds the rotating presidency of the council, said that  “the council has decided that this deliberation has to take place during the month of April.” Any request to become a UN member state must first pass a vote by the Security Council — where Israel’s ally the United States wields a veto — and then be endorsed by the General Assembly.
The Palestinians, who have had observer status at the world body since 2012, have lobbied for years to gain full membership, which would amount to recognition of Palestinian statehood.
“Today is a historic moment,” Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour told reporters on Monday as the Security Council started the review process after the Palestinians last week relaunched its formal 2011 bid.
“All we ask for is to take our rightful place among the community of nations, to be treated as equals, equals to other nations and states to live in freedom and dignity in peace and security in our ancestral land,” Mansour said in the General Assembly.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has for decades resisted creation of a Palestinian state and leads a far-right government with members hostile to the Palestinian Authority, which holds limited autonomy in sections of the West Bank.
And under US legislation, the United States is required to cut off funding to UN agencies that give full membership to a Palestinian state.
The Palestinians’ campaign faces decisive US opposition in the UN Security Council. Washington previously opposed the effort when it was raised in 2011. “Our position hasn’t changed,” said Deputy US Ambassador Robert Wood.

Israeli forces and Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, have exchanged regular cross-border fire since the day after Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 raid on Israel that triggered crisis in the Gaza Strip.
Other armed groups in Lebanon including Palestinian militants have also occasionally claimed launches into Israel. “It is six months since the exchanges of fire across the Blue Line began, and continue unabated, taking a heavy toll on both sides,” said a joint statement from UN special coordinator for Lebanon, Joanna Wronecka, and Aroldo Lazaro, head of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon.
UNIFIL peacekeepers patrol the so-called Blue Line between Lebanon and Israel, demarcated by the UN in 2000 after Israeli troops pulled out of southern Lebanon.
“The violence and suffering has gone on too long. It must stop,” the officials said.
They urged all sides to  “avail of all avenues to avoid further escalation while there is still space for diplomacy”.
Hezbollah, which has a powerful arsenal of rockets and missiles and says it acts in support of Hamas, has upped its attacks though they are generally limited to the border area.

10,EU nears final vote on landmark asylum reform,1.14m people sought asylum in 27-nation bloc last year.,"BRUSSELS: The EU will vote on Wednesday on a vast overhaul of its immigration policies that would notably harden entry procedures for asylum-seekers and require all the bloc’s countries to share responsibility.
The European Parliament will decide a series of laws forming the bloc’s migration and asylum pact, based on a European Commission proposal first made in September 2020.
The overhaul was reached only after overcoming years of tensions and divisions among EU member countries. Once fully adopted, it would come into effect from 2026.
Alongside its passage, the European Union has been striking agreements with several outside countries to try to reduce the number of migrants leaving their territories with the goal of reaching Europe.

1.14m people sought asylum in 27-nation bloc last year

The backdrop of the two-pronged approach is a rise in asylum applications in the 27-nation EU, which last year reached 1.14 million, the highest level since 2016.
Irregular migrant entries into the bloc are also increasing, to 380,000 last year according to the EU’s border and coast guard agency Frontex.
The migration and asylum pact has been opposed, for very different reasons, by the far right, the far left and some socialist lawmakers.
“After years of impasse, the new migration rules allow us to regain control over our external borders and reduce pressure on the EU. State authorities, not smugglers, have to decide who enters the European Union,” said Manfred Weber, head of the biggest political group in the European Parliament, the centre-right European People’s Party.
NGOs and migrant charities have come out against the reform, especially its provision creating border facilities to accommodate asylum-seekers and quickly send back those deemed ineligible, which they fear will lead to systematic detentions.
The reform largely retains the basic rule in force under which the first EU country in which an asylum-seeker arrives is responsible for their case.
But it adds a “solidarity mechanism” that requires all EU countries to help front-line states such as Italy and Greece when they come under pressure by either taking in some of the asylum-seekers or providing an equivalent financial contribution.
Inflammatory topic 
A French centrist lawmaker in the European Parliament, Fabienne Keller, who shepherded one of the texts, called the pact “very balanced” and “a big improvement over the current situation”.
“There are better checks on flows of irregular migration through the border procedures and more solidarity,” she said.
But she acknowledged it was “a hugely inflammatory topic” and criticised far-right lawmakers for “trying to panic everybody” over the changes.
The parliament’s vote will not be the last step for the pact, as the technical application of its procedures still need to be defined, Keller said.
They include how to organise the border centres and supply them with sufficient resources, translators and police officers.
Another controversial point is a provision to send asylum-seekers to “safe” third countries.
A left-wing lawmaker, Raphael Glucksmann of France, said “that would allow asylum-seekers likely to obtain asylum in an EU country to be sent to transit countries”.
He criticised a compromise under which some EU nations would be able to offset their financial obligations under the solidarity mechanism if they helped pay for tougher border security in another EU country.
“That upholds the idea of a ‘safe third country’ which would apply to some countries that are ‘safe’ only by that label,” he said. “It’s another step towards the outsourcing of our borders.” On the far right, lawmaker Jean-Paul Garraud of France said “the outer borders of the EU are like sieves and nothing has been done to change that”.
One of the few changes the far right favoured was a system to take the biometric data of each arriving asylum-seeker and put it into an EU database called Eurodac, he said, though he argued it would do little to stop mass irregular immigration.
“These mechanisms are just smokescreens,” he said. “They will be ineffective and won’t be able to be applied given the scale of the migration flows.”
