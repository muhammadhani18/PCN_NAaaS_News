SAHIWAL: After completion of High Resolution Satellite Imagery (HRSI) of 36 districts of Punjab, the drone mapping of urban localities has started in Sahiwal under the World Bank-funded project of Punjab Urban Land System Enhancement (PULSE).
Deputy Commissioner Ikramul Haq is now overseeing the pilot project under the PULSE to drone map urban localities. It will be extended to other districts of Punjab once the pilot project here is over within next week or so.
The DC said on the basis of HRSI all districts have now been divided into two zones-- high density control points and low density control points -- which means urban and rural localities of each district.
“Since high resolution images of both urban and rural areas have been taken, now drone images will be taken for direct measurement and intensive land ownership verification.”
The DC said the drones can capture detailed and high-resolution imagery which provides a clear and comprehensive view of urban areas.
The drone imagery has a high-resolution aerial view which is time-efficient and has improved accuracy of land ownership record. After the development of digitised base map, the ownership details of urban land pieces will be integrated with the existing land ownership record of Punjab Land Record Authority (PLRA) database.
At the rural side, missing mouzas/village information has been streamlined through scanning which will upgrade the centuries old land record through on-ground and field verification.
“The whole drone imagery exercise is aimed at improving land and property register of hereditary land both in urban and rural localities,” the DC further added.
It will also help in future decision-making processes to improve land and property registry, he said.

The provincial government has notified a 16-member DCC with at least eight lawmakers belonging to PML-Q and two to PML-N -- MNA Naseer Abbas Sidhu and Abid Raza Kotla.
The deputy commissioner is the secretary of the committee which also includes district police officer and chief executive officers of health and education authorities.
Talking to Dawn here on Monday, Mr Kotla said he had conveyed to the personal staff of CM Maryam Nawaz that he could not accept the membership of such a committee being headed by a Q leader who had just obtained 8,000 votes on the Punjab Assembly seat and still became a lawmaker and a provincial minister.
He said forging a coalition with the PML-Q might be a compulsion of party Quaid Nawaz Sharif but the Gujrat chapter of PML-N did not accept such an arrangement with those who had consistently harmed the local PML-N workers for long.
He vowed to do the politics of resistance against the Q-League and invited members of PTI’s Parvez Elahi camp in Gujrat to join him in resistance against the hegemony of PML-Q in the district.
The Gujrat district chapter of PML-N also held a consultative meeting on Sunday where issues pertaining to the local political and administration affairs were discussed.
Another former MNA Nawabzada Ghazanfar Ali Gul, the head of the Nawabzada family, said in a statement that despite having reservations over party’s arrangement with the PML-Q, he firmly stood with Mian Nawaz Sharif due to critical political and economic conditions of the country.
He said there was no question of joining hands with any of the factions of the rival Chaudhry family.
He announced an unconditional support to the party leadership but said he would convey or discuss his reservations in some meeting with the senior party leadership instead of publicly putting any pressure on them.

7,"Governance issues, corruption jeopardise LDA service delivery",SWOT analysis advises against delegating additional charge of DG.,"LAHORE: A recent SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis reveals that the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) has been facing serious governance-related issues amid corruption that requires immediate attention and intervention from the government to improve service delivery.
Based on simulation exercise, the analysis was conducted during the 39th mid-career management course (Research Group-6) organized by the National Institute of Management, Lahore, on Chief Minister Task Force for Inspecting Public Service Delivery of LDA.
Discussing governance, the analysis identifies one-window cell, digitisation of record, adoption of international standards, urban regeneration projects, disaster resilience planning, public private partnership, GIS mapping, artificial intelligence, planned urban development, stakeholders’ management and litigation issues as “strengths and opportunities” of the LDA. However, the rapid urbanisation /informal settlements, enforcement/encroachment issues, infrastructure deficiencies, governance and transparency, political interference, corruption and bribery, litigation, budgetary constraints and land mafia have been identified as “weaknesses and threats” of the authority.
Discussing the issues, the report mentions human resource as one of the major issues given the vacant posts of 373 officers (BS-17 to BS-20). It also raises concerns over performance of various LDA directorates, as they raised objections on total 173,190 applications and sent replies to the applicants through one-window cell.

SWOT analysis advises against delegating additional charge of DG

In 2023, the LDA’s planning, engineering, headquarters, housing and town planning wings received total 80,4071 applications (28,031, 01, 99, 512,167 and 263,503, respectively). Of these, the LDA directorates disposed of 400,985 applications, out of which 176,072 and 224,913 applications were disposed of timely and with delay, respectively. The directorates approved 365,131 applications, while rejecting 35,854 others.
The report recommends hiring of legal experts, digitizing/sifting of record, monthly feedback of complaint (response) timeliness, enhancement of one-window cell’s capacity, crackdown against unlawful activities, and devising of a mechanism for monitoring.
It also suggests the government should not appoint director general (DG) of LDA on a temporary basis (by entrusting the officers with additional or look after charge).
“Despite being an old, autonomous and financially independent authority, the LDA failed in achieving its mission of effective service delivery, it faces significant challenges related to budget, HR and procedural constraints, lack of innovation and IT infrastructure, bureaucratic and policy insufficiency. LDA needs to effectively address these issues through targeted actions to improve existing IT & AI structures, revenue generation, staff upgrade, improved accountability methods, stakeholder management and public inclusion. These targeted actions are critical to enhance LDA’s full potential in efficient service delivery on par with international standards,” the analysis concludes.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, in a recent review meeting, had also expressed grave concerns over the rising public complaints, related to corruption and other issues, against LDA. During the meeting, she also sought improving service delivery by all means with a direction to newly-appointed LDA DG Tahir Farooq to make all-out efforts to give relief to the public at large, besides taking innovative initiatives to make Lahore a “sustainable and livable” city under a phased programme.

Of them, 40 motorcycles were recalled from Dera Ghazi Khan, the hometown of former chief minister Usman Buzdar. These heavy bikes were sent to DG Khan during the tenure of Mr Buzdar, ignoring the fact that they were meant for Lahore only.
An official told Dawn that the then CM had dispatched the fleet of 40 Dolphin Squad bikes from Lahore to DG Khan and all of them had been thrown into workshops with multiple technical faults.
The official said the street crime had increased during the past few months when about 600 heavy bikes of the Dolphin Squad were grounded due to unavailability of spare parts.

On receiving the grant, Dolphin Squad SP Zohaib Nasrullah Ranjha hired 15 mechanics and got the bikes repaired at designated workshops.

These teams have been deployed at Liberty Roundabout, Minar-i-Pakistan, Lahore Fort and some posh localities of DHA that are frequented by women and children. The police personnel of the FPUs were assigned the task to keep an eye on the suspects targeting the families. They would be in contact with the Safe City Authority and the central operations rooms for coordination.

The transformation plan ranges from the provision of interest-free loans to small farmers for watercourses’ improvement, tube wells’ solarisation and laser leveling to legislative action and institutional reforms.
Speaking to Dawn, Punjab Agriculture Secretary Iftikhar Ali Sahoo said the initiatives announced in the plan would address the fundamental issues like farmers’ access to credit, quality of agricultural research, improving agricultural extension and water efficiency. He said the projects would contribute towards farmers’ profitability through enhanced crop productivity and crop diversification. While the institutional reforms and new legislation would upgrade the regulatory framework to ensure quality of agriculture inputs.
“Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has approved the Rs150bn Punjab Kissan Card to enable the agriculture department to offer interest-free loans to 500,000 small farmers through the Bank of Punjab to purchase agricultural inputs. A sum of Rs60bn has been allocated for the CM Programme for Improvement of Watercourses in Punjab to improve some 7,300 watercourses with a 70:30 cost sharing basis across the province,” Mr Sahoo said.
In the current situation when power cost is skyrocketing, according to the secretary, the government has approved a Rs10b programme for solarisation of tube wells to convert some 5,000 electric tube wells to solar systems by 2026. The government will provide about 1,000 laser levelers in the first phase of six months and 2,280 units in the second phase until 2026 at the cost of Rs1.6bn. Through the agricultural mechanisation programme, the farmers would be provided with 24,800 agricultural implements until 2026, out of which 1,800 implements would be distributed by October this year at a cost of Rs7bn.
The secretary said model agriculture centres would be established at districts’ level in the first phase, which will be gradually expanded to tehsil and town level in the second phase. These centres would provide all agricultural inputs, machinery, credit and allied services to the farmers at a centralised point.
Mr Sahoo said the government had approved the engagement of 500 agriculture graduates, revitalisation of the extension wing and establishment of the Pak-China Research and Development Centre with a total budget of Rs2bn each. The department’s research wing would be revamped with the establishment of three centres of excellence for cotton, rice and wheat at a cost of Rs1bn. Moreover, university and academia linkages would be established along with active collaboration with the private sector to upgrade the quality of agricultural research in Punjab.
According to the officer’s claims, the government is also ready to embark on legislative action and institutional reforms to amend the Fertilizer Control Order 1973, Punjab Agriculture Pesticides Act-2012 and revive the Punjab Agriculture Commission.
Moreover, he said, the task of revamping the Punjab Seed Corporation and Agricultural Research Board would be undertaken within a year.

Higher Education Department (HED) Secretary Dr Farrukh Naveed chaired the meeting to discuss strategies for ensuring transparency in the upcoming FA/FSc annual examination in the province.
Dr Naveed announced several key decisions aimed at enhancing the integrity of the examination process.
He stated that private invigilators would no longer be appointed for examination duty, and exam centres would not be established in narrow streets. Instead, spacious venues such as schools, colleges, and marriage halls would be selected to facilitate easy access for students and supervisory staff.
The secretary directed all board chairpersons to improve the remuneration of examination staff and ensure the presence of resident inspectors during examinations. He emphasised that any individual found involved in malpractices should face strict action without discrimination.
Dr Naveed also mandated that all CEOs ensure the attendance of supervisory staff. He instructed the meeting attendees to compile lists of staff who neglect or refuse duty, and to take disciplinary action in all such cases.
He further stated that government buildings, particularly colleges, schools, and university halls, should be prioritised as examination centres.
Dr Naveed also proposed that the School Education Department (SED) secretary be made a permanent member of the PBCC.
In an effort to prevent the leakage of question papers, Dr Naveed directed the participants to devise a plan for the use of watermarks and the move is expected to significantly enhance the security of examination materials.
The meeting concluded with a firm resolve to uphold the integrity of the examination process and ensure a fair and transparent system for all students.

15,Ministries failure to repatriate kids of two women irks court,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday expressed serious displeasure over the failure of foreign and interior...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday expressed serious displeasure over the failure of foreign and interior ministries to extradite minor children of two women despite the lapse of over two years.
Chief Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan was hearing petitions by two women seeking repatriation of their children, who were allegedly illegally removed from Pakistan by their respective fathers.
Federal Secretary for Interior retired Capt Khurram Agha appeared before the court and furnished reports on behalf of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
The secretary told the court that he took charge of the office a week ago following the retirement of his predecessor. He sought two months for the implementation of the court’s orders regarding the extradition of the minors.
An official of the foreign affairs office also appeared before the court but no report was submitted on behalf of Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
The chief justice observed that prima facie the act of the foreign minister appeared to be contemptuous. “But I refrain from issuing any proceedings against him and he is directed to remain careful in future and furnish a report,” the chief justice added.
Rejecting the request of the interior secretary, the CJ remarked that the petitions were pending for over two years and countless adjournments had been granted to the authorities on one pretext or another.
The justice observed that the interior ministry was full of incompetent officials.
In one case, the CJ noted that the interior ministry lied to the court regarding the arrest of the child’s father.
The CJ adjourned the hearing till May 8 and observed that both ministers and the prime minister can be summoned in person if compliance of the court’s orders was not made.
“Mr Mohsin Naqvi, Federal Minister of Interior, Islamabad and Mr Ishaq Dar, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs, Islamabad shall again submit comprehensive report on the next date regarding the steps taken for the recovery of minors and extradition of accused of this case,” CJ Khan said in his order.
Rabia Imtiaz filed a petition in 2021 while Anam Jahan approached the court in 2022 seeking recovery of their children. They pleaded that the fathers of the minors unlawfully removed them from Pakistan on fake documents as there were restraining orders by respective guardian courts.

16,Shujaat-Parvez rift blamed on Naqvi,"PTI polling agents being detained, says Qaisra","GUJRAT: Qaisra Elahi, the wife of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf President Parvez Elahi, and her sister Sumaira Elahi have accused Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi of creating a division among Shujaat Hussain and Parvez Elahi.
They also blamed the local police for detaining the polling agents of PTI candidate Chaudhry Parvez for the bypolls in PP-32 (Kunjah) at the behest of the rival candidate of PML-Q so that they could not perform duties on the voting day on April 21.
They made these remarks while addressing a news conference at Gujrat Press Club here on Monday.
They said Parvez Elahi was still sincerely standing by Imran Khan.

PTI polling agents being detained, says Qaisra

Qaisra Elahi said the sons of Shujaat Hussain presented themselves as heirs of Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi Shaheed but their politics was contrary to their claim.
Was it Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi’s policy to raid people’s houses and pick them up? she asked. “For the by-election, the polling agents and workers of Parvez Elahi are being picked up by the police.”
Samaira Elahi said these two brothers had violated the sanctity of the houses in Gujrat. “The way Salik and Shafay Hussain stole the general election, we will not allow this to happen in the by-election.”
Qaisra Elahi said: “I thought that Salik and Shafay would come out of their inferiority complex by sitting in high positions, but this did not happen.”
Qaisra and Sumaira said Mohsin Naqvi had played an important role in creating a rift between Shujaat Hussain and Parvez Elahi.
They further said Salik Hussain tried to meet Parvez Elahi continuously in Adiala and PIMS but Parvez refused to meet him and also sent back the flowers.
They said the brothers, who became federal and provincial ministers by stealing the election, were only harbouring hatred for Gujrat.
