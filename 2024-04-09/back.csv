0,Internet services briefly disrupted nationwide,Operators attribute problem to ‘technical issue’,"Pakistan’s internet services on Tuesday were disrupted for a short period of time with users reporting outages and sluggish speeds from various parts of the country.
Outage tracking website Downdetector.com reported disruptions in internet services across various regions of the country with Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL), Nayatel, and Transworld Home reportedly affected in the afternoon.
The tracking website showed that at around 4 pm, users indicated no problems with Nayatel and Transworld Home.
However, the problems with PTCL persisted. Users primarily experienced PTCL service disruptions in Lahore, Karachi, and Rawalpindi.
Transworld Home users encountered similar problems in Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi, and Peshawar.
Nayatel users reported issues mainly in Rawalpindi, Lahore, and nearby Okara.

Internet services monitor Netblocks’ network data also showed a disruption to connectivity in Pakistan affecting multiple providers with a high impact on Transworld and Nayatel followed by recovery.
“Operators attribute the incident, which comes amid [the] ongoing X/Twitter restrictions, to a technical issue,” it added.
Transworld Home sent an email to customers acknowledging an ""unexpected nationwide outage"" affecting internet services in Pakistan.
The company assured customers of an active investigation into the matter and committed to restoring services once the outage was resolved, apologising for any inconvenience caused.
Access to the social media giant X has been blocked since February 17 as allegations of rigging during that month’s general elections continue to make news.

The ban was imposed after former Rawalpindi commissioner, Liaquat Ali Chattha, publicly claimed to have allegedly changed election results in his area. It soon went viral on social media.
On the general elections day, the caretaker government suspended mobile phone and data services across the country, despite the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority's (PTA) previous assurances that internet access would not be interrupted.
In January this year, a nationwide disruption on social media platforms was experienced amid a virtual event organised by the PTI.
Later, the caretaker government and PTA blamed “technical issues” for the internet outages across the country, saying that there was no guarantee that such incidents would not occur in the future.
The PTI then moved the top court against the internet suspensions, asking it to take notice of the disruption of popular social media platforms, including X, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.

1,Imran’s jail security measures cost Rs1.2m monthly,"Separate CCTV camera system installed at a cost of Rs500,000","The security provisions for PTI founding chairman Imran Khan at Adiala Jail are clocking a hefty monthly bill of over Rs1.2 million, according to the report submitted by the jail superintendent to the Lahore High Court (LHC).
The report details the specialised facilities provided to Imran Khan within the prison premises, including a separate CCTV camera system installed at a cost of Rs500,000, distinct from the system overseeing the 7,000 other prisoners.
Imran Khan's meals are prepared in a dedicated kitchen under the watchful eye of the assistant superintendent and are subject to inspection by a medical officer or deputy superintendent before being served.
Furthermore, a team of over six doctors from Holy Family Hospital is stationed to provide medical care to the former prime minister, with additional specialist teams conducting regular check-ups.
Of the seven special cells available, Imran occupies two, while the remaining five are kept closed for security reasons, with Imran utilising the yard for his daily walks. Typically, 35 prisoners are accommodated in these cells.
Access to Imran Khan's cell is tightly restricted, requiring permission for entry, and professionally trained personnel are assigned to ensure the security of his ward.
While Adiala Jail typically assigns one personnel for every ten prisoners, Imran's security detail comprises 15 personnel, including two security officers and three dedicated to his personal security.
Moreover, a designated area within the jail premises is allocated for Imran Khan's recreational walks, equipped with exercise machines and other amenities.
Strict regulations are enforced for visitors, and comprehensive security protocols are implemented during court proceedings.
The report reveals the collaborative efforts of jail police, Rangers, and district police in ensuring the security of Adiala Jail, including regular search operations and mock drills.
Additional police forces, Rangers, and elite personnel are deployed both within and around Adiala Jail to maintain a secure environment for Imran Khan and all inmates.

2,SJC petitioned against Justice Kayani,Complainant accuses IHC senior puisne judge of adopting an ‘anti-state agenda’,"A complaint has been lodged with the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against Islamabad High Court (IHC) Senior Puisne Judge Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, seeking his removal over alleged misconduct.
Former secretary of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA), Waqas Malik Advocate, filed the complaint, accusing the judge of pursuing an ""anti-state agenda"" and colluding with other IHC judges. These alleged actions, deemed as misconduct, warrant his removal from the post.
Justice Kayani is among six judges who, on March 27, wrote a letter to the SJC chairman--Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, citing alleged interference by intelligence agencies in judicial matters.
The letter stirred controversy, prompting the federal government to announce the formation of an inquiry commission after consultation with CJ Isa.
Subsequently, the apex court initiated suo moto proceedings following former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani's recusal from heading the proposed inquiry commission.
Coincidentally, the letter by IHC judges was followed by a series of threatening and poison-pen letters sent to judges of the higher judiciary by anonymous individuals.
PTI condemns complaint against Kayani
Meanwhile, the PTI vehemently denounced the complaints filed against Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, asserting that these complaints are part of the government's efforts to intimidate and harass judges.
Following the party's core committee meeting in Lahore on Monday, a statement was issued, highlighting that the complaint against a specific judge amid the poison-pen letters saga indicated an organized anti-judiciary agenda.
The party urged the chief justice of Pakistan to investigate the incidents of direct and indirect harassment against judges and identify those responsible for orchestrating this organized campaign.

3,Eid frenzy reaches its climax,Prevailing inflation has limited the purchasing capacity of the salaried class,"As Eidul Fitr is just around the corner, majority of the people are giving last minute touch to their preparations through visiting the shopping malls and local markets of the federal capital to celebrate this auspicious occasion in a befitting manner.
In various commercial hubs such as Super Market, Jinnah Super, Karachi Company, F-10 Markaz and popular shopping malls, shoppers have been flocking since noon to finalize their shopping amidst prayers and fasting.
Several women can be witnessed in the main markets and shopping malls of the capital looking for dresses, shoes, and other essential accessories to celebrate the Eid festivities in a befitting manner, taking advantage of the Eid sales.
Saira Qasim, a mother of three children, said, “I have completed shopping for my family earlier thinking that there will be more people during the last days before Eid and the required sizes of dresses and shoes may not be available.”
Talking to APP, she said, “Although the online shopping platforms have made it easier for many to shop while sitting at their homes during fasting but still visiting the market physically for Eid shopping has its own charm.”.
Ansha Mehmood, a young girl, said, “I bought my Eid dress and shoes from the nearest shopping mall, availing of the sale offers. Now I have to buy just bangles, jewelry, and henna on the `Chaand Raat’ with my friends”.
She said, “I always try to buy dresses and shoes by the middle of Ramzan as all the good stuff is sold out during the last few days before Eid, while the tailors also stop taking orders during the last week of Ramazan as they also leave for native towns.”.
Hira Iftikhar, who is a government employee, said, “Shopping during the month of Ramazan is a difficult task, so I am trying to complete it so that I can focus on prayers to seek blessings from Allah during the last Ashra of the holy month.”
The prevailing inflation has limited the purchasing capacity of the salaried class, so I completed all shopping for my family at a local market, she said while talking to APP. Eid-ul-Fitr is the biggest festival for all Muslims across the world, and Muslims celebrate this festival with great religious zeal and enthusiasm.
The capital city comprises over half of the population, of which a major chunk belongs to the different provinces.
A large number of people settled here for job purposes have moved to their hometown to celebrate the festival with their near ones combining the weekends back and forth with Eid holidays by taking leave of Monday and Tuesday.
While some others are planning to leave for their towns on Tuesday, leaving the city deserted.
Keeping in view this, most of the natives have finalized their preparations so that they can move to their hometowns before the commencement of Eid celebrations.
Amir Masood, who is a government employee and belongs to Sindh said, “I took leave on Monday and Tuesday to combine weekends back and forth along with the Eid holidays (Wednesday to Friday) so that I can spend maximum time with my parents and other family members.
“Eid is the only occasion when all the family members come together and spend good time with each other as frequent traveling is not possible due to the rising fuel prices and busy office schedule”, he said.

5,FIA to address Bajwa complaint as per law,IHC also issues notices on objections raised to complaint by former army chief,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has directed the Federal Investigation Agency to address “in accordance with law” a complaint lodged against four individuals, including a former army chief and a spymaster, for allegedly violating their code of conduct and disseminating false information.
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq took up a petition on Monday filed by a citizen, Atif Ali, through his lawyer Raja Rizwan Abbasi, seeking directions for the FIA to initiate a case against former army chief Gen (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa, former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed, and two renowned journalists.
At the last hearing of the case on April 1, the court had directed the petitioner to submit the receipt of the complaint that he allegedly lodged with the agency after some of the respondents claimed that the FIA had never received any such complaint. The petitioner on Monday submitted that receipt.
During the hearing the lawyer for General (retd) Bajwa also raised objection to the petition.
He said the petitioner had claimed six months back that he had submitted a complaint with the FIA and later filed a petition in the court complaining that the FIA was not initiating an inquiry and registering a case on the basis of the complaint.
“However, after six months it transpires that the FIA has received the complaint only now. In view of this irregularity, the petition should be dismissed,” he contended.
When the lawyer for one of the journalists asked the judge to refer the matter to a division bench, Justice Farooq noted that a division bench can also be formed but first the FIA will have to determine whether it wants to lodge an FIR or not.
The court noted that it is a common case even though some significant people have been accused in it.  It later directed the agency to decide the complaint according to the law while also issuing notices to respondents on the objections raised to the complaint by General (retd) Bajwa.

6,"IHC asks AG to ensure meeting between Imran, wife",The judge noted that he would issue an order in the case after Eid-ul-Fitr.,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has directed the office of the capital’s advocate general (AG) to ensure implementation of the court’s order regarding arranging meetings between former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi on Eid days as well as on a weekly basis.
A single-member bench comprising Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb on Monday noted that the AG must coordinate with the relevant departments to ensure that the incarcerated couple meets.
The bench issued these instructions while hearing an application filed on behalf of Bushra Bibi seeking implementation of the court’s April 1 order.
Imran is currently detained at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail while his wife is confined to Imran’s personal residence at Bani Gala, which was declared a sub-jail after Bushra’s conviction.
During the proceedings on Monday, the judge asked the AG's office to contact the Islamabad Chief Commissioner's Office, prison authorities, and other relevant parties and also report why the court decisions have not been implemented yet.
The judge noted that he would issue an order in the case after Eid-ul-Fitr.

7,"$149.7m WB loan for flood protection, digitisation","WB blames power, gas tariffs for high inflation","The Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank has approved financing of $149.7 million for the 'Digital Economy' and 'Flood Prevention' projects of Pakistan, aimed at improving economic efficiency, coordination and transparency and prevention of floods in the future.
According to the World Bank, $78 million had been allocated for the ‘Digital Economy Enhancement Project’, which will improve financial system through technology and data-based decision making, as supporting a growing digital economy in Pakistan is the key to economic and social development.
Separately, $71.7 million has been allocated for the improvement project of Sindh barrages to ensure flood protection. The project will increase the resilience of the canal system and reduce the adverse effects of extreme flood and drought events.
The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) is committed to finding technology-based financial solutions to attract foreign investment in the country and to strengthen itself against the calamities of environmental pollution, said a press release.
Meanwhile, the World Bank has attributed the historic rise in inflation to the surge in electricity and gas prices. With the increase in electricity and gas rates in the country, the inflation rate has soared to its highest level in 50 years.
The World Bank forecasts that the inflation rate will remain at 26% in the current fiscal year 2023-24, but anticipates a decrease to 15% in the subsequent fiscal year 2024-25, further dropping to 11.5% in 2025-26.
According to documents, the World Bank notes that inflation in Pakistan during the first six months of the current fiscal year has hit its highest since 1974, attributing the significant increase in production costs to the surge in electricity and gas prices.
The World Bank underscores that the primary cause of the inflation hike in Pakistan is the escalation in electricity and gas prices.
In urban areas, the cost of energy has risen by 50% in the first six months of the current fiscal year, with energy inflation standing at 50.6%, compared to 40.6% in the same period last year.
Energy inflation refers to the rate at which prices for energy-related goods and services are increasing over a specific period.
It measures the percentage change in the cost of energy, including electricity, gas, fuel, and other energy sources, compared to a previous period. In the context of the news report, ""energy inflation"" specifically refers to the increase in prices related to electricity and gas.
The average inflation rate for the first six months of the current fiscal year was 28.8%, up from 25% in the corresponding period last year. Despite the stability of the rupee, increased local crop production, and decreased price pressure in the global market, inflation in Pakistan has surged.
The World Bank projects that the average inflation rate in Pakistan for the current fiscal year 2023-24 is expected to be 26%, compared to 29.2% in the previous fiscal year. However, it anticipates a decline to 15% in the next fiscal year 2024-25, further dropping to 11.5% in the fiscal year 2025-26.

8,Shahid Khaqan Abbasi set to launch new party,Former PM says new party to actively take part in next general elections,"Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former prime minister and prominent figure in the PML-N, has approached the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to register a new political party.
Abbasi visited the ECP office in Islamabad on Monday, where he submitted an application for the registration of the new political entity. Alongside the application, he provided all necessary documents required for the registration process.
""We are initiating the party's registration in accordance with the Election Act of 2017. We intend to actively participate in the upcoming elections under the banner of this new party,"" he stated. He also mentioned that the party's name has yet to be finalized.
Abbasi had previously hinted at the formation of a new party due to his differences with the top leadership of the PML-N. He had also suggested the emergence of a new political entity following the nationwide polls held on February 8.
Last December, the former prime minister announced his decision not to contest in the upcoming general elections.
In August, he criticized his own government for undermining public trust in the system, labeling the National Assembly of that period as the worst in the country's history.
Once considered a close ally of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Abbasi distanced himself from the PML-N after the party leadership appointed Nawaz's daughter, Maryam Nawaz, as the PML-N's chief organizer and senior vice president earlier in 2023.
Subsequently, the seasoned politician, along with another PML-N leader Miftah Ismail and former PPP senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, advocated for a change in Pakistan's political landscape through a series of seminars titled ""Reimagining Pakistan.""
