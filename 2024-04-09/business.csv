0,Remittances at two-year high during Ramazan,"March inflows recorded at $2.95bn, highest since April 2022.","KARACHI: The quantum of remittances increased to almost $3 billion in March, taking it to the highest level since April 2022, primarily due to Ramazan, according to the central bank’s data.
The total remittances in March stood at $2.95bn compared to $2.25bn in Feb, a month-on-month increase of 31.2pc. The year-on-year increase was 16.4pc, compared to the inflows of $2.54bn in March 2023.
This is the highest remittances inflow since April 2022, when overseas Pakistanis sent $3.12bn, as per the State Bank’s data.
The country-wise breakdown for March shows that the highest inflow was from Saudi Arabia at $70.31m, up from 54m in Feb. Inflows from the US stood at $37.25m, up from 28.74m in Feb. Similarly, overseas Pakistanis sent $54.85m from the UAE, up from $38.48m last month.

March inflows recorded at $2.95bn, highest since April 2022

The inflows from the UK were $46.15m, $30.27m from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and $31.47m from the EU nations.
During the first nine months of FY24 (July-March), the year-on-year remittances quantum increased by 0.9pc despite slow inflows in the first half of the current fiscal year.
Total remittances during the nine months of this fiscal year were $21.04bn, up from $20.84bn in the same period last year.
Experts believe that higher inflows in March were because of Ramazan when inflows usually remained high due to charity and increased consumption.
The higher remittances inflows are helpful in reducing the current account deficit, stabilising the exchange rate and improving the overall confidence in the economic sector.
The remittances, which have already exceeded the revenue from export earnings, also help the State Bank in debt servicing, which is now considered the main threat to Pakistan’s economy.
The country would pay about $24bn in FY24, while $25bn would be required for debt servicing during the next fiscal year.
The remittances are higher than the country’s need for debt servicing, but the huge trade deficit eats up almost all inflows, forcing the government to borrow more money.According to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics data, the trade deficit widened year-on-year by 56.30pc to $2.17bn in March. However, the overall gap in the first nine months of the current fiscal year narrowed by 24.94pc to $17.03bn compared to $22.68bn in the corresponding period last year.

1,34 firms get licences for making electric vehicles,A senior EDB official said the most pressing issue was the lack of financing for customers.,"ISLAMABAD: The Engineering Development Board (EDB) has issued 34 licences to manufacturers of two- and three-wheelers under the Electric Vehicles Policy for 2020-2025, as part of the transition from traditional fuel-powered automobiles to EVs.
At the same time, private partners are jumping into EV manufacturing, said Asim Ayaz, a senior EDB official, in a speech during a webinar at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) on “Pakistan’s electric vehicle market: challenges, opportunities, and the 2030 agenda”  on Monday.
Mr Ayaz said the most pressing issue was the lack of financing for customers as EVs were more expensive than fuel-based vehicles due to the high price of batteries. He said the ministry had proposed that every petrol station have an EV charging station.
“The ministry has compared the National EV Policy with Malaysia’s and found that it is good in tariff. But we lack funding streams and financing solutions,” he said.
“The ministry is closely working with the Lahore University of Management Sciences (Lums) and other industry partners for adoption of EVs.”
Dr Arshad, a professor at Lums, emphasised that significant money was available for EVs on a worldwide scale, and the government would not need to rely on the IMF or World Bank for finance because the global community wants EVs as a means to cut carbon emissions rather than for economic development.
“Pakistan can tap that money by linking its EV transition ambition with GHG emissions, aligning it with GHG reduction perspective,” said Dr Arshad.
He further stated that global climate finance might be administered through a competitive procedure that would favour only well-planned and superior projects.
“The faster we go, the faster we will reach our goal,” he said. Midhat Waris said Shell Global had the world’s largest EV setup, with over 1000 charging stations, and it had tested its rapid chargers in Pakistan.
She also dwelt on the launch of Shell’s largest EV charging station in China, which has a capacity of 250 outlets. “We want to take key positions in terms of EV charging in Pakistan and K-Electric partnership is vital to achieving this ambition,” Waris said.
Japanese resistance
Dr Naveed Arshad said battery technology was evolving and demanded research and development, along with capital and technical resources.
Ahmed Sajeel of Deewan Motors BMW said Japanese car makers were resisting EVs, but their resistance was unsustainable in the current environment as the international vehicle industry had opted to shift to EVs.
He claimed that the Ministry of Climate Change is “highly friendly” and supportive of EVs, but the country needed a long-term regulatory framework to work effectively and avoid further delays.
Electric vehicles alone are not the solution, but infrastructure is essential, and manufacturing them locally is the way ahead because Pakistan is rich in silica and other raw minerals, he noted.
Dr Aazir Anwar Khan said EVs would have a significant impact on the middle class, which currently relies on two or three-wheelers.
“Air quality and environmental hazards are huge in the country due to transport sector emissions, whereas 60 per cent of imported oil is being consumed by motorbikes,” he added.
The country aims to move immediately from fuel-powered automobiles to EVs and the outlook for such a transition was favourable, Dr Aazir observed.

2,Ant group partners with Nayapay,A press release by the company said the program aims to enhance international visitors’ experience and drive business for local merchants.,"KARACHI: Ant Group, along with 11 overseas payment partners of Alipay+ and major international card organisations, has launched in Beijing a nationwide program to build International Consumer Friendly Zones across major Chinese tourist and commercial cities, with the support of relevant authorities and local governments.
A press release issued on Monday said the program aims to enhance international visitors’ experience and drive business for local merchants.
At the launch, Alipay+ jointly announced with NayaPay, Pakistan’s leading fintech platform, that NayaPay users will be able to make payments with their e-money account at Alipay+’s extensive network of 80 million merchants in China as bilateral trade and visits increase.
NayaPay thus becomes the 11th overseas and 1st Pakistani payments platform to “roam” in China, following AlipayHK (Hong Kong SAR, China), Changi Pay (Singapore), HiPay (Mongolia), Kakao Pay (South Korea), MPay (Macao SAR, China), Naver Pay (South Korea), OCBC Digital (Singapore), Toss Pay (South Korea), Touch ‘n’ Go eWallet (Malaysia), and TrueMoney (Thailand).
Ant Group now offers two mobile payment alternatives for overseas visitors in China. Alipay+, a suite of cross-border mobile payment and digitalisation technology solutions under Ant International, enables overseas consumers to pay with their home e-wallets across China.
Introduced in 2020, Alipay+ now connects over 88 million merchants in 57 countries and regions to 1.5 billion consumer accounts on over 25 e-wallets and banking apps. This allows consumers to travel and pay worry-free globally and merchants to boost revenue through a growing portfolio of digitalisation tools.
Travellers may also choose to bind major international bank cards, including Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover®, and Diners Club International, to an Alipay app to access a rich array of local Alipay services from shopping, dining, ride-hailing to public transportation while in the Chinese mainland, without needing a local bank account or phone number.
On this occasion, Danish A. Lakhani, CEO of NayaPay, said today marks a monumental milestone in the commercial relationship between China and Pakistan as we witness establishing the first direct payment channels between our two nations.

5,Oil falls 1pc on Gaza ceasefire talks,"Both benchmarks fell more than $2 earlier in the session, with investors focusing on Israel’s decision to withdraw more soldiers.","NEW YORK: Oil prices fell over a dollar a barrel on Monday after Israel reduced its troops in southern Gaza and began a fresh round of ceasefire talks with Hamas.
Brent crude futures fell $1.07, or 1.2 per cent, to $90.10 a barrel by 1:26 p.m. ET (1726 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude was down 85 cents, or 1pc, at $86.06.
Both benchmarks fell more than $2 earlier in the session, with investors focusing on Israel’s decision to withdraw more soldiers from southern Gaza on Sunday.
Also weighing on oil prices were expectations that US crude oil stocks likely rose last week, Staunovo said.
However, the decline in oil prices should be modest until it becomes clear how Iran will respond to the bombing of its consulate in Syria last week, he added.
The bombing, for which Tehran has said it will take revenge, heightened concerns that the Middle East conflict could broaden and have tangible impacts to oil supplies.

6,No extension in onion export ban under consideration: commerce minister,"Chicken, gold rates hit new peak ahead of Eidul Fitr.","KARACHI: As exporters sought a 15-day extension, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan said on Monday that the ban on onion exports was only for Ramazan till April 15, and no extension was under consideration.
The minister stated this while talking to media persons after a meeting with the office-bearers of the Pakistan Business Council (PBC).
As the export ban has failed to provide any price relief, exporters have asked the government to extend it till April 30.
In a letter to the Ministry of Commerce, All Pakistan Fruits and Vegetables Exporters, Importers and Merchants Association (PFVA) Patron in Chief Waheed Ahmed said that exporters had unanimously decided to extend the ban by 15 days for the country’s interest.

Chicken, gold rates hit new peak ahead of Eidul Fitr

Amid a surge in exports following an Indian ban, consumers have paid up to Rs350 per kg for locally produced onion compared to Rs50-120 per kg in September 2023. Pakistan restricted exports from the second week of March 2024 to lower the onion prices but consumers did not get any relief.
The Indian government initially imposed a ban on Dec 8, 2023 till March 31 but recently extended it till further orders to ensure domestic availability and stabilise prices.
Pakistani onion exporters took full advantage of the Indian ban to earn handsome foreign exchange at the cost of unbearable local prices.
Karachi’s official onion rate is Rs219 per kg, but traders charge Rs250-Rs300 per kg.
Boosting confidence
According to APP, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal, speaking at the PBC, said that the government was confident and focused on improving all the factors linked with the economy to boost the business community’s confidence.
He said that the ministry was well aware of its responsibility to reach out to the business community for input and was determined to do its utmost to resolve the challenges that businessmen and industrialists face.
He said that the government and the business community were considering the options to move things positively.
He said smuggling was also controlled to a greater extent in the previous caretaker government period and some of the initiatives needed to be taken ahead. 
“Steps were taken during the last five months to improve the border control mechanism and now the government has decided to establish a dedicated authority to enable all the concerned departments to operate under one umbrella,” he added.
Jam acknowledged that suggestions were received from car manufacturers and that decisions would be made ahead of the next budget.
Regarding the deteriorating security situation in Karachi, he said that law and order are provincial subjects. However, the federal government would continue extending its cooperation and bring improvement.
Chicken
As Eidul Fitr is just one day away, retailers have increased the price of broiler live birds by up to Rs540 per kg from Rs420-460 per kg two weeks ago.
Surprisingly, Commissioner Karachi’s retail price for broiler live birds is Rs428 per kg. Ignoring the official poultry meat rate of Rs663, retailers charge Rs760-800 per kg to consumers.
Gold at new peak
The local one-tola gold rates hit an all-time high of Rs245,700 on Monday, up by Rs600 per tola based on world bullion prices, which also reached a record $2,355 per ounce, up by $5 per ounce.

7,PSX sets record on ‘good news’ from S. Arabia,"KARACHI: Amid growing prospects of realising Saudi investment in diversified sectors, the stock market on Monday...","KARACHI: Amid growing prospects of realising Saudi investment in diversified sectors, the stock market on Monday turned in another record-breaking session in Ramazan, tossing the KSE 100-share index to an all-time high, closing above 69,500, though the volume fell day-on-day.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation told Dawn that Saudi Arabia’s commitment to fast-track the initial tranche of $5 billion investment in Pakistan boosted investor confidence, triggering a strong interest in blue-chip oil, banking, and pharma stocks as investors weigh deliberations over the $1 bn Saudi Reko Diq deal next month and Saudi oil-giant Aramco’s acquisition of stakes in Oil and Gas Development Company and Pakistan Petroleum Ltd.
Reports suggest this commitment was reached at a meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Makkah on Sunday night.
Mr Mehanti also noted that a surge in Brent crude prices above $90 per barrel, higher banking spreads and a high court case vacated against pharmaceuticals over the deregulation of non-essential medicines also contributed to a spectacular rally one day ahead of the long Eidul Fitr closure.
He, however, advised retail investors to remain cautious and focus on high dividend-paying stocks owing to the geopolitical crisis and government approvals to raise gas tariffs for captive power plants ahead of talks with the IMF for a new bailout.
He hoped easing political noise and speculations over IMF talks and climate change funds could send the PSX to new highs post-Eidul Fitr.
Arif Habib Ltd Head of Research Tahir Abbas said the market was upbeat as Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is planning to leave for Washington to attend IMF/World Bank spring meetings, where he was expected to negotiate a new Extended Fund Facility crucial for the long-term sustainability of the country. 
“With inflation slowing down, investors are also anticipating an interest rate reversal soon, which is also boosting their confidence,” he added.
Topline Securities Ltd said the market started the shorter week (two trading sessions before Eid holidays) with a bang. Bulls resumed their northbound march as investors opted to further strengthen their equity positions by value hunting across the board, especially in blue-chip stocks. 
Consequently, fertiliser, power, banks and tech contributed positively as Fauji Fertiliser Company, Hub Power Company Ltd, MCB Ban, Systems Ltd and Meezan Bank collectively added 486 points to the index performance. 
Pak-Kuwait Investment Company Ltd Head of Research Samiullah Tariq thinks the bullish market is incorporating recent stability in forex reserves, overall confidence in the sovereign bond market, hopes of a new IMF deal, and expectations of the materialisation of a deal with the Saudi government.
As a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index hit an intraday record high of 69,710.84, gaining 1,294.05 points. However, it closed at 69,616.84 points after adding 1,203.20 points, or 1.76 per cent from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume dipped 13.61pc to 335.61 million shares. The traded value fell by 14.35pc to Rs15.31bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan Telecomm­unication Company Ltd (33.75m shares), The Searle Company Ltd (21.10m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (18.13m shares), K-Electric Ltd (17.48m shares) and Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (16.69m shares).
The companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited (Rs150.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs48.88), Shahmurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs41.93), Sazgar Engineering Company Ltd (Rs32.72) and Highnoon Laboratories Ltd (Rs26.04).
The shares registering the most significant decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs49.93), Al-Abbas Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs35.00), Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs22.00), Mehmood Textile Ltd (Rs10.00) and JDW Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs9.79).
Foreign investors remained net buyers as they bought shares worth $1.70m.
