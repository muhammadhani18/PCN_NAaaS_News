0,Many find Eid travel unaffordable,"Transporters resort to overloading, fare hike amid rush","The provincial capital of the country largest province, a city of over 13 million people, is predominantly populated by people non-locals. The fact becomes evident during Eid holidays as many localities present a deserted look after millions of students and workers leave for their hometowns.
In recent days, the influx of those leaving the city led to unusual rush on public transport. Bus and railway stations were swarmed by travelers.
Many passengers had to wait for hours to even to purchase the transport tickets.
The transporters exploited the situation not only by overloading but also overcharging.
According to a passenger, this is an old routine in the metropolis but in recent years marked by unprecedentedly high inflation rates, it had become tormenting for the working class to travel to their homes on such occasions.
The means of transport used by the citizens facing financial constraints draw the highest number of complaints of overloading.
The transporters place portable seats in the vehicles and in many instances ask the passengers to sit on the rooftop or keep standing during the whole journey after paying the normal fare.
A student from Balochistan, Ibtihaj Ahmad, who had recently graduated from a public sector university in Lahore is preparing for competitive examinations, said while speaking to The Express Tribune that he would prefer to stay in the city rather than leaving for his home.
He said the return ticket would cost him more than his monthly expenditure on staying and studying in Lahore.
A restaurant waiter, Ramzan Khan, also said that the fares were not affordable for him.
Both the men said they would plan to visit their homes later, when the fares would return to a normal level after the number of passengers would drop.
On the other hand, the City Traffic Police Lahore (CTPL) have announced a crackdown against transport overloading and overcharging.
Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Ammara Athar said the traffic police had imposed fine for overcharging on 360 buses in recent days.
She said the operators of 192 vehicles had been penalised for overloading.
The drivers and owners have been asked to paste the fare lists prominently on the buses, she added.
Over 10 teams have been deployed at major public transport hubs in the city, including the Lorry Ada, Babu Sabu, Niazi Chowk, Thokar Niaz Beg, Shahdara Chowk and Begum Kot to take action against overloading and overcharging.
The CTO warned that the vehicles found involved in overcharging and overloading would be impounded in police stations.

2,LHC moved against naming infrastructure after leaders,"Petition terms act illegal, unlawful and against basic rights of citizens","A petition was filed in the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Tuesday seeking the declaration of associating any street, road, government institute, city, or town in Punjab with the name of any politician or ruling elites as ‘illegal’.
The petitioner, Mushkoor Hussain, filed the plea through advocate Nadeem Sarwar and made the chief secretary and secretaries of local government, health and communication works department, ministry of information and culture, and secretary home as respondents.
The petitioner pleaded against the naming, or renaming of any public location after any individual having no positive social impact, role, or exceptional dedication to service in ways that bring special credit to an area, city or town.
“The act is illegal, unlawful, and against the basic rights of citizens of particular areas,” he added.
The plea further demanded the removal of signboards and other advertisement mediums (names of individuals, politicians, ruling elites, and feudal lords) showing streets, roads, buildings, towns, and cities in the Punjab.
Hussain highlighted that the name of Imam Bibi Maternity Hospital (named after the mother of the nation's esteemed poet and philosopher, Dr Allama Muhammad Iqbal) was changed to Khawaja Safdar Hospital recently.
“Unfortunately it is evident from the conduct of the provincial government and functionaries that the cities, towns, streets and all institutes (educational and health), relating to the public, in general, have been treated as part of some undeclared kingdoms of local feudal and political lords of each town, city and area, therefore, naming, renaming such institutes, towns, cities, roads, streets is also part of their kingdom rule which clearly depicts the mindset of our politicians and ruling elites.”
The petitioner stated that he witnessed roads, streets, towns, overhead bridges, educational institutes, hospitals, public parks, and universities in Lahore and in the province being named or renamed after people or individuals related to the ruling class of the province.
He added that the role of such individuals in matters of development, betterment, and services was ignored.
""Such impression shall, undeniably, frustrate the very purpose of guidelines which are meant to encourage people to serve the nation; work in defined fields, or serve people by wealth. Hence misuse of such powers would not only violate the law but would also result in disappointment among those, who actually sacrificed their lives for positive causes,"" the petitioner maintained.

4,Legislators to oversee ‘Lahore revamp’ plan,Minister vows not to leave any street or sewerage line unpaved,"Committees consisting of elected representatives will be formed to monitor the implementations of the Chief Minister's Lahore Revamping Plan.
The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by Punjab Local Government Minister Zeeshan Rafique.

The minister instructed the executing agencies to ensure GIS mapping of the revamping schemes.
Ordering arrangements for temporary drainage of sewage water from Bund Road, he vowed to implement a strict system of monitoring of the revamping plan.

The minister vowed to strictly ensure the completion of the work by the deadlines set on the order of the chief minister.
Zeeshan Rafique said the system of immediately redressing the citizens' complaints would also be made effective.

When he appeared in the court along with his daughter and some other relatives, he was told that their former neighbour Imran Sarfaraz had filed an application against them.
According to Masih, Sarfaraz showed the birth certificate of his daughter to the court, according to which her age was only 11 years, while a marriage certificate filed with the application mentioned the date of marriage as October 10, 2023.
After this, Sarfaraz pressed the family to marry off the girl after her conversion to Islam.

6,Lawyer jailed in contempt case,Verdict stems from disruptive behaviour during court proceedings,"The Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Chief Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan has sentenced a lawyer to six months in prison for contempt of court.
This decision stems from a series of disruptive incidents that occurred during court proceedings, prompting the court to take strict action.
The case began with a suo moto proceedings initiated on a reference sent by LHC’s Justice Sultan Tanvir Ahmad against the lawyer.
The lawyer in question had engaged in highly contemptuous and disorderly conduct, which included shouting in the courtroom and levelling baseless allegations against the judge.
Moreover, he had instigated fellow lawyers to challenge the court’s authority, further exacerbating the situation.
The incident that triggered this legal action took place on February 21, when Abdul Samad, an additional prosecutor general, disrupted court proceedings while conversing with another lawyer and exchanging books.
The court promptly intervened, instructing Samad to refrain from disturbing the proceedings. However, during a brief adjournment, Advocate Zahid Mehmood Goraya, the respondent in this case, began shouting in the courtroom, levelling false allegations against the judge and inciting fellow lawyers to file a reference against Justice Tanvir.
Subsequently, Justice Tanvir called the lawyer to his chamber to address his behaviour. However, the lawyer not only refused to meet with the judge but also continued to use contemptuous language, exacerbating the situation further.
Following this incident, Justice Tanvir referred the matter to LHC’s Chief Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, who initiated contempt proceedings against the lawyer.
A show cause notice was issued, demanding an explanation for the lawyer's conduct and directing him to appear in person before the court.
Despite multiple directives from the court, the lawyer failed to appear for the proceedings, prompting Chief Justice Khan to issue a non-bailable arrest warrant against him.
Eventually, the police apprehended the lawyer and produced him before the court.
Upon being presented in court, the lawyer tendered an apology, claiming that he never intended to use derogatory language against any court. However, Chief Justice Khan cited previous incidents of misconduct, including FIRs registered against the lawyer, suspension of his license by the Bar Councils, and references filed against him in the past.
In response, the lawyer maintained that he is a humble and calm professional, expressing his willingness to personally apologise to Justice Tanvir.
Chief Justice Khan, however, ordered day-to-day trial proceedings and scheduled the next hearing for framing charges against the lawyer.
During the trial, witnesses were examined, and the lawyer's version of events was heard in detail. After consideration of the evidence presented, Chief Justice Khan rendered a verdict, sentencing the lawyer to six months in prison and imposing a fine of Rs100,000.

9,Teams deployed to curb polio resurgence,"Kids to be vaccinated at transport terminals, hospitals, parks and malls","The authorities in Punjab have deployed hundreds of polio teams at important transit points ahead of Eidul Fitr to curb poliovirus resurgence in major cities.
The Eid transit points deployment plan, approved by Punjab Emergency Operations Centre Coordinator Khizer Afzaal, has been set in motion after environmental samples from the region tested positive . The detected poliovirus clusters have been linked to active virus in Afghanistan and other polio hotspots in Pakistan.
Punjab has tested 76 environmental samples this year, of which eight have tested positive, raising fears that poliovirus might spread in cities, putting children at risk.
The Punjab government has deployed nearly 300 teams at 30 bus terminals, eight railway stations, 24 hospitals, 20 amusement parks and 10 shopping malls.
Vaccination at all the sites will continue till April 20 without a break during the Eid holidays.
“The decision to set special transit points has been taken to ensure that virus does not return to the province or find its way through Punjab to other provinces,”confirmed Khizer Afzaal.
The districts where the special transit points have been set up are Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Faisalabad, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Sahiwal, Okara, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur, Sialkot, Gujranwala and Gujrat.
The sites are in addition to the 23 permanent ones already functioning.
Beggary
Meanwhile, the City Traffic Police Lahore (CTPL) have deployed three buses for taking away beggars swarming the major markets on the eve of the Eid.
The buses will remain deputed during the crackdown at the Mall Road, Liberty Market and Karim Block.
Four squads of police have also been formed for the purpose.
Professional beggars swarm the markets and main roads in unusual numbers during festive occasions like Chand Raat and Eid. Owing to the poverty and inflation, an unprecedentedly high number of beggars is being observed in Lahore this year.
The city government, district and traffic police along with the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau have been conducting raids to apprehend the beggars.
Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Ammara Athar said the traffic police had registered 173 cases against professional beggars in Ramazan.
Over 4,000 children and aged people were released after warning.
The beggars are removed from traffic signals and cases are registered against those cheating the citizens by posing as physically challenged.
The official appealed the citizens also to discourage such elements as they created hindrance in traffic flow.
CCPO Bilal Siddique Kamyana said 766 cases of beggary have been registered this year, leading to the arrest of 759 people. Of the arrests, 208 were made in the City Police Division, 54 in Cantonment Division, 111 in Civil Lines Division, 167 in Saddar Division, 80 in Iqbal Town and 139 in Model Town.
Kamyana emphasised that groups involved in begging, including those exploiting children and women, do not deserve any leniency. He ordered a crackdown on handlers of beggars and urged swift action against those exploiting children for begging.
