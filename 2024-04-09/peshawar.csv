3,Outgoing PHC chief says paid ‘heavy price’ for recent judgements,Full-court reference held for CJ Ibrahim Khan.,"PESHAWAR: Outgoing Peshawar High Court Chief Justice Ibrahim Khan said Monday he had paid a heavy price for his recent judgements.
During a full-court reference for him at the high court ahead of his retirement on April 14, Justice Ibrahim said that in the recent political turmoil, the PHC received thousands of petitions from outside the limits of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which were decided “virtuously within the four corners of law.”
“I have no affiliation whatsoever with any political party or figure, but unfortunately, one political party had preferred these petitions [to be filed with our high court]. Though I have paid a heavy price for my recent verdicts, I am overwhelmed to proclaim that as the chief justice of KP, I ensured the rule of law at the cost of my career progression,” he said.
 
 

The CJ said since his elevation to the high court, he had passed around 15,000 judgements and of them, 509 were challenged in the Supreme Court.

Full-court reference held for CJ

He added that the apex court upheld verdicts in 279 of those cases and set aside only 42 of small nature, while 188 were still sub judice.
Justice Ibrahim said in his 31-year-long judicial career, he performed his duties to the best of his conscious, within the legal premise, and without any fear or favour.
“I was assigned the most arduous task of my entire service when appointed to the commission to probe the heart-wrenching incident of the Army Public School massacre, notwithstanding that I was on the 10th position on the seniority list of the high court,” he said.
The CJ said it was a formidable challenge, and he, along with his team, burned midnight oil to formulate an all-encompassing report covering every question raised before it.
He said the commission interacted with the parents of martyrs, senior army generals, bureaucrats, and officers of law-enforcement agencies.
“I have already submitted an extensive report to the chief justice of Pakistan, but my memories attached to this commission are unforgettable,” he said.
Justice Ibrahim said his paramount emphasis throughout his judicial service remained the amicable settlement of disputes, and he was proud to announce that he had decided a record number of family cases in particular through that mode.
He said his efforts brought together thousands of families with extremely strained relations.
“Besides, I have also compromised in thousands of other civil and criminal matters, and this fact is on record. Similarly, record human rights applications were received, proceeded with, and decided fruitfully during my tenure,” he said.
The CJ said throughout his service, he strived to embody the virtues of integrity, impartiality, and a steadfast commitment to justice, principles he believed would naturally pave the way for recognition and career advancement based on merit.
“To my successors and my brother Judge Ishtiaq Ibrahim, I offer my heartfelt blessings, best wishes, and humble prayers. May you carry the torch of justice with pride, integrity, and compassion, and may you always remember that behind every case file lies a human story—a story that deserves to be heard, understood, and respected,” he said.
Peshawar High Court Bar Association president Tariq Afridi, advocate general Shah Faisal Utmankhel, and additional attorney general Sanaullah paid tribute to Justice Ibrahim for his services to the judiciary.
Justice Ibrahim joined the Peshawar High Court as the additional judge on August 11, 2016. He was made a permanent judge of the PHC on June 1, 2018, and the acting chief justice of the PHC on July 7, 2023. He was made the high court’s chief justice on August 25, 2023.

4,TI directed to revise corruption report in light of court observations,PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Monday ordered the Transparency International (TI) to recall its National...,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Monday ordered the Transparency International (TI) to recall its National Corruption Perception Survey (NCPS) 2023 report and issue a revised survey report in light of the court observations.
On December 22, PHC Chief Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan ordered TI to furnish evidence regarding its report wherein judiciary was declared the second most corrupt institution of the province.
“Your organisation should withdraw this report if you do not have proof to substantiate this claim,” Justice Khan had observed last year and had asked TI board members to furnish evidence of any corruption in the high court.
During the hearing of the case on Monday, PHC ordered TIP that the revised report should be published and circulated in the manner and form of NCPS 2023.
The court sought explanation from TI about missing data regarding 788 responses and asked it to show the exact number of rejected forms as to how many were rejected in the case of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“After accurate number of forms are ascertained, accurate percentage shall be provided,” the court ordered.
PHC also ordered the TI board to explain and include the 87%, 85% and 57% claims in the revised NCPS 2023 report for readers. The court observed that TI must not leave key findings buried in the data to be discovered by lay readers from reading between the lines.
Justice Ibrahim ordered TI to set out clearly the inherent limitation of perception survey in the revised NCPS 2023 and the explanation provided in its response of January 15, 2024, should be included in the revised report.
The court observed that it was disappointing that TI did not show willingness to correct the report on its own. 
Had TI showed willingness to revise and rectify the report, there would have been no need for order of the court, it added.
Justice Khan observed that it was made clear that the aim of the judgment was not to limit the freedom of expression or objective and credible research and was rather meant to encourage reliable, valid and credible research that would assist the institutions and serve public interest.

7,DHOs complain about shortage of essential medicines in KP,Ask dept for supplies cleared by testing lab to prevent audit objections.,"PESHAWAR: District health officers in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province have complained about the shortage of essential drugs and asked the health department for supplies cleared by the drug testing laboratory to cater for patients and prevent objections by the audit department.
Official documents available with Dawn reveal that around 40 medicines purchased by the province’s directorate-general (health services) were found to be “substandard, misbranded, or both” during examination at the DTL in the last three months.
In a letter to the directorate on April 6, the DHO of Kohat district highlighted the “critical shortage of essential medicines” at the health facilities supervised by him.
“Unfortunately, we have not yet received the ‘top-up’ medicines requested to address their acute shortage. With Eid holidays only two days away, this lack of supplies poses a significant challenge,” he said.

Ask dept for supplies cleared by testing lab to prevent audit objections

The DHO said the medicine distribution required the DTL’s clearance to avoid audit objections.
“Without it, supplies might not be made, as I (DHO) am already facing the advanced audit paragraph from last year because of the DTL clearance prior to the distribution of medications,” it said.
The official sought the directorate’s immediate intervention to ensure uninterrupted patient care at Kohat’s public sector health centres during Eid days and beyond.
“We require a swift and effective arrangement to guarantee the availability of essential medicines at our facilities, which are already facing severe shortages,” he said.
Sources in the health department told Dawn that in the last four months, 38 drugs as well as disposable items were found to be either substandard, misbranded, or both, which should have been cleared by the DTL prior to their procurement.
They added that most drug manufacturers or suppliers were locals, while in some cases, the suppliers had given “misbranded” goods to the health department, which bought them for all government hospitals in the province.
“The government claims to have made enough supplies to the hospitals recently, but a report by the Independent Monitoring Board has pointed out a shortage of essential medicines in most hospitals,” an official insisted.
He added that those drugs were procured from the firms, most of which didn’t meet criteria, due to “poor inspection” by authorities.
“More than 50 per cent of the firms have been paid by the health department despite testing the failure of their items at the DTL. Only last week, the department purchased Rs4 billion medicines and other goods, but the DHOs have yet to receive them, much to the misery of patients, especially those with injuries or in critical condition,” he said.
The official said most recently, the DTL detected “particles” in a commonly used injection supplied by a Lahore-based company.
A DHO told Dawn on condition of anonymity, that he was afraid of accepting drugs without their clearance by the DTL, as such an act could be objected to by the audit department and could even lead to action by the National Accountability Bureau.
“I, like other DHOs, want all medicines, surgical items, and chemicals to be tested and cleared by the DTL before dispatch to hospitals,” he said.
When contacted, DG (health) Dr Shaukat Ali claimed that no drug purchased by the department had been tested substandard or misbranded.
“We are in the process of medicine procurement for and supply to the district hospitals. This exercise will be completed by May 15. All drugs will be cleared by the DTL,” he said.
Dr Ali said if any medicine failed the DTL testing, its supplier wouldn’t be paid.
He said the shortage of drugs was caused by the non-release of government funds in the last two years.
“Now, the process of medicine procurement is in progress,” he said, adding that the DHOs were purchasing drugs on their own to address shortages.

They said now traditional Charsadda Chappal was sent as gift to Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia, UAE etc.  
Some seven years ago, Saudi Arabia was sent a container full of Charsadda Chappal, which was well received in the market there, but due to lack of government support this practice could not be continued, they regretted. 
The traditional footwear available from Rs1,000 to Rs1,500 in these shops is sold from Rs3,000 to Rs5,000 in showrooms in other parts of the country, these people said.  
The people associated with the chappal making said high value leather was used in the footwear to maintain its brightness and durability. 
Though the local craftsmen have made extraordinary efforts and continued to revive the footwear industry no effort has been made at the government level to help them in flourishing this industry. 
Keeping in view the skills and expertise of these cobblers, the Export Promotion Bureau had decided to establish a footwear training institute some 15 years ago, and for this purpose about 32 kanals of land had also been purchased, but the building of the institute has not yet been constructed. 
However, since 2003, the EPB and Charsadda Chappal Makers Association have continued the training process in a rented house, imparting skills to thousands of youth and hundreds of women till now. Now these people are engaged in shoemaking in various factories in other cities, including Karachi and Lahore, the people associated with the business said. 
According to them about 8,000 people are directly involved in shoemaking, including a significant number of women. These women while sitting in their homes engage in sole sewing and slipper making, becoming an invisible economic force to earn for their families. 
These people said prices of raw material were skyrocketing. They said though most of the leather was produced in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Afghanistan its tanneries were in Punjab, incurring huge costs on its transportation. They said if these factories were set up in KP then not only raw material would be available cheaply and easily but thousands of people would also get employment. 
These people said if the provincial government constructed footwear making units on the vacant plot of 32 kanals, then the region would become an industrial hub like Sialkot, and not only slippers but other leather products like jackets, racquets, thread and handbags would be manufactured, guaranteeing economic uplift of people. 
They said there was a need to provide resources and opportunities to chappal makers to participate in exhibitions organised in the country and abroad, thus creating a new revenue-earning channel.
