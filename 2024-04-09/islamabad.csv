3,Rawalpindi Development Authority demolishes ‘illegal’ structures during operation in Bahria Town,Operation conducted on complaints of Bahria Town residents.,"RAWALPINDI: Taking notice of alleged illegal activities along Soan River in Bahria Town Phase VIII, Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) enforcement squad during an operation on Monday demolished billboards, temporary structures, Marina IT Tower hoardings and sewer holes.
RDA spokesman Hafiz Irfan told Dawn that on the directives of RDA Director General Kinza Murtaza, the RDA’s enforcement squad took action for illegal conversion of green belts and roads into commercial plots in Bahria Business District in violation of approved layout plan (LOP) of Bahria Town Phase VIII in Mouza Gali and Mouza Shahpur Rawalpindi.
 
 

The authorities conducted the operation on the complaints of the residents of Bahria Town who had approached the RDA through its representative body, known as Brace. He said the RDA’s operation against illegal development and illegal housing schemes was in full swing, alleging that the housing scheme was carrying out illegal development without the approval of no-objection certificates (NOCs) in violation of Punjab Development of Cities Act 1976 and Punjab Private Housing Schemes and Land Subdivision Rules 2021.
“The housing scheme was illegally displaying advertisements along Soan River by Capital Estate Icon marketing company,” he added.
The RDA enforcement squad, including assistant director Building Control/Incharge Enforcement Squad, the assistant director planning, superintendent scheme, the scheme inspector and others with the assistance of the police from the concerned police station Rawat carried out operation against above mentioned housing scheme.
He said the RDA DG had directed the officials of the concerned directorate to take strict action against encroachments, illegal and unauthorised constructions and commercial activities without any fear and favour.
 
 

He said the general public should also show moral responsibility and remove every type of encroachment as much as they could so that they could avoid any further losses. The RDA suggests the citizens to consult with it before investing in such projects, he added.
Apart from this, he said the RDA made it clear that there would be no permission to carry out development work on the right of the way of Soan River. He said the RDA would raze the building structure in and around the Soan River banks.
He said the RDA also sought the help of local police to carry out the anti-encroachment drive and unauthorised buildings. He said the RDA had prepared the list of the illegal housing societies and for the public awareness, it had been uploaded on the websites and different squares of the city. He requested the people to check the website of RDA before going for investment in any housing scheme in future.

4,"Rift between MCH director, staffers spells troubles for patients",Staffers allege MCH head incompetent; Dr Nosheela says staff turned on her for enforcing discipline,"ISLAMABAD: Services at Mother and Child Hospital (MCH) of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) have been affected and a rift between the MCH head and her subordinates is adding to the misery of patients.
Against this backdrop, a number of applications had been filed with the ministry, the federal ombudsperson, and other forums to highlight the state of affairs at the hospital in the federal capital. According to the subordinates, Dr Nosheela Amjad, the head of the department at MCH, lacked ‘clinical experience’ and was not able to run the hospital properly. Dr Nosheela denied this and said her subordinates were irked due to her focus on merit and discipline.
According to documents available with Dawn, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics (BS-19) Dr Nosheela was entrusted the current charge of professor on April 6, 2023. The nurses at MCH in a letter to the health ministry secretary alleged that the doctor was forcing the staffers to refer patients to her private practice in Max Health Hospital, Sector G-8. The MCH does not take patients after three months of pregnancy, but the patients can be booked in the hospital after their Max Health consultation, the letter alleged.
According to the nurses’ letter, the doctors are forced to tamper with the records of junior doctors if they “refuse to do illegal act”. The letter demanded a fact-finding inquiry into the issue.

Staffers allege MCH head incompetent; Dr Nosheela says staff turned on her for enforcing discipline

Another application submitted by the Young Doctors Association (YDA) that two “lucrative” posts i.e. director and the MCH HOD were being held simultaneously by Dr Nosheela in contravention of the judgement of the apex court.
An application submitted by a resident Shahid Khan, in the office of the Federal Ombudsman and available with Dawn, stated the doctors misbehaved with his wife in the labour room. The complainant alleged that when his wife tried to respond, the doctor allegedly told her that she “can kill her and no one will be able to prove it” as accidents can take place during surgeries/deliveries.
Another application alleged that Dr Nosheela was an assistant instructor at the population ministry and was transferred to Pims after the ministry was devolved in light of 18th Amendment. It claimed that she was not competent enough to run MCH.
A doctor working at MCH told Dawn that Dr Nosheela was from the admin cadre in the population ministry and had no experience with patients. She, however, managed to get her non-clinical experience converted into clinical experience to become the head of the department, she said. Later on, she got the additional charge of the MCH director to oversee the administrative issues which led to a conflict of interest.
“Besides that, she started her private setup at G-8 Max Health Hospital; just after one month she started issuing the policies regarding the admissions of patients to MCH and her policy is simple: mint the money from poor patients as the staff is forced to admit a limited number of patients and ask others to go to the private setup of Dr Nosheela,” she alleged. “Patients are booked from Pims for a private hospital in which the HOD sits. That practice should be stopped,” she suggested.
Administration’s view
Dr Nosheela rebutted the claims made by the staffers, saying the hospital staff turned on her because she was trying to ensure discipline and punctuality in the government-owned facility.
“Pims is the hospital from where I got my initial training. Unfortunately, the hospital was facing the same issues in 2023, which I observed during my training. I decided to address the issues thinking that Allah has given me the power so I must deliver,” she said.
The doctor alleged that the majority of the doctors were visiting the hospital only to mark their attendance and then leave the hospital during duty hours to deal with private deliveries.
“...they were also getting Rs 80,000 per month as non-practicing allowance [those who do not practice in private clinics get Rs 80,000 per month]. I banned and stopped payments of non-practicing allowance and I don’t take it as well because I am also doing private practice,” she said.
“Pims had Dr Batool in the past and she was very famous for her dedication to the profession. I want to become Dr Batool. The fact is that doctors work in private hospitals till late at night and they don’t bother to reach Pims in the morning. I am not going to tolerate it because I cannot allow 60 postgraduates [trainee doctors] to run the Outpatient Department (OPD) of MCH because they can make blunders,” she said.
Replying to a question, Dr Nosheela said that there was a capacity of 60 births in a day and she admitted 60 patients [including those who are not registered] on a first come first serve basis and suggested others to go somewhere else.
“Pims is a tertiary care hospital and we should only have complicated and emergency cases. I never refuse complicated cases. Moreover, we check 300 patients in OPD daily. I believe that being a tertiary care hospital, we should not deal with normal deliveries at all,” she said.
Replying to a question, she said that it was correct that she and some other doctors were transferred from the devolved Ministry of Population but got the endorsement of the court when staff contacted courts against their appointments. “I don’t care about those who have been criticising. I just want to deliver and there is visible difference/improvement in services of MCH as compared to past,” Dr Nosheela claimed.

The school is being established at Kurri area with an estimated cost of over Rs5 billion.
In order to provide quality education to the marginalized and talented students, the Punjab government had established a chain of Daanish schools all over the province.
It is said to be the largest network of boarding schools for girls and boys in the country. They are far-reaching educational welfare schools established for the most marginalised segment of the society.
The other provinces are also establishing Daanish schools to provide quality education to talented students.
The current federal government also intends to establish Daanish School in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). For this purpose, Capital Development Authority (CDA) has allocated a piece of 10 acers land.
“Establishment of the Daanish School in ICT represents a significant step towards addressing the challenges facing the education sector in Pakistan’s capital city,” said an official of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
‘By providing quality education to residents belonging to deprived sections, we can empower learners, strengthen communities, and contribute to the development of a more equitable and inclusive society. With dedication, collaboration, and innovation, we can transform education system’s pedagogy from rote learning to 21st century learning and leveraged education technology to improve and track delivery,” he adedd.
The project in Islamabad is proposed for next Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP 2024-25).
The school will provide access to modern quality education to students who lack opportunity of quality education. It will also overcome lack of learning opportunities through modern pedagogical techniques in education.
The concept will also address non-availability of qualified teachers to provide learning of subjects of contemporary education.
It is believed that the school will enhance access and relevance of quality education and provide opportunities for modern school education to students belonging to under privileged families and vulnerable groups of the society.
It will provide chance of learning opportunities through modern pedagogical techniques in education.
The school will also provide qualified students as work force to contribute to national economy.
The project is said to be fully aligned to mainstream the students belonging to families of low income groups by providing access to quality education and provide learning opportunities to children enrolled in Daanish School by principles of equality and inclusion to ensure that the students graduating from these schools are not left behind in the national stream.

10,Islamabad police finally get acting IGP,"Sources say commissioner’s office, interior ministry working to abolish Police Order","ISLAMABAD: Amid a prolonged absence of the police chief in Islamabad following the transfer of ex-IGP Dr Akbar Nasir Khan, the chief commissioner’s office on Monday asked the Ministry of Interior to appoint the ‘most senior officer’, DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza, as the acting chief.
In a letter addressed to the joint secretary of the Ministry of Interior titled ‘assignment of additional charge’, the chief commissioner’s office said the newly posted IGP (Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi) had not assumed the charge.
In the absence of the IGP, the official work of the capital police was suffering, the letter said, adding that it was requested that the temporary charge of the IGP Islamabad be assigned to DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza Khan, who is the “senior-most officer” of the capital police at present.
Meanwhile, DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza took the acting charge on Saturday night, the police sources said, adding that the DIG also chaired a meeting on Monday as the acting IGP. The meeting was attended by the DIG operations, acting DIG Security, and SSP operations.

Sources say commissioner’s office, interior ministry working to abolish Police Order

According to the Esta Code (Civil Establishment Code) and Rules of Business 1973, the IGP can appoint the senior-most officer to look after the top post for 90 days or till the appointment of a regular police chief.
Since the IGP failed to appoint his stopgap replacement and the new police chief appeared reluctant to take charge, the most senior officer of the capital police will look after the office of the IGP as per the rules as mentioned earlier.
‘Not the most senior officer’
Sources said DIG Raza was not the most senior officer in the capital police, as DIG Awais Ahmed, currently in Kenya, is fourth in the seniority list of CTP-29 whereas DIG Raza is in the 14th place. Both are from the CTP-29, however.
However, DIG Hassan Raza will remain the most senior officer till the return of DIG Awais Ahmed who is in Kenya on official duty regarding the murder case of Arshad Sharif, a Pakistani journalist who was shot dead in Nairobi by the police in Oct 2022.
Police Order’s twilight
Due to repeated tussles over the powers of the IGP under the Police Order, the commissioner’s office and the interior ministry are now working together to abolish the Police Order promulgated by the former IGP without following the due procedure.
Now the two offices are working to bring the capital police under the Police Rules, the sources said, adding that approaching the interior ministry by the commission office to appoint the acting IGP was a part of the same strategy.
The police spokesperson said DIG Awais Ahmed was not coming to work but he was not sure who granted the police officer a leave from office. It may be noted that along with two other DIGs, DIG Security Awais Ahmed also applied for a 15-day leave from the commissioner but the request was declined on account of a tug-of-war between the police and local administration. The same officers had sought five-day leaves from the ex-IGP because they did not ‘salute’ a junior officer who was named as the police chief.

Sources said DIG Raza was not the most senior officer in the capital police, as DIG Awais Ahmed, currently in Kenya, is fourth in the seniority list of CTP-29 whereas DIG Raza is in the 14th place. Both are from the CTP-29, however.
However, DIG Hassan Raza will remain the most senior officer till the return of DIG Awais Ahmed who is in Kenya on official duty regarding the murder case of Arshad Sharif, a Pakistani journalist who was shot dead in Nairobi by the police in Oct 2022.
Police Order’s twilight
Due to repeated tussles over the powers of the IGP under the Police Order, the commissioner’s office and the interior ministry are now working together to abolish the Police Order promulgated by the former IGP without following the due procedure.
Now the two offices are working to bring the capital police under the Police Rules, the sources said, adding that approaching the interior ministry by the commission office to appoint the acting IGP was a part of the same strategy.
The police spokesperson said DIG Awais Ahmed was not coming to work but he was not sure who granted the police officer a leave from office. It may be noted that along with two other DIGs, DIG Security Awais Ahmed also applied for a 15-day leave from the commissioner but the request was declined on account of a tug-of-war between the police and local administration. The same officers had sought five-day leaves from the ex-IGP because they did not ‘salute’ a junior officer who was named as the police chief.
