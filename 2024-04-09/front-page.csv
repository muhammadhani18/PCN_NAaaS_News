• Saudi, Pakistani premiers also discuss Gaza and Kashmir
• Tranche is part of $25bn pledged under SIFC
• Joint communique makes no mention of the area of investment
• Shehbaz wraps up his three-day tour to Kingdom 
ISLAMABAD: Saudi Arabia has committed to fast-tracking the initial tra­nche of $5 billion investment in Pakistan, while Islamabad has promised to facilitate the expedited process aimed at enhancing economic cooperation between the two countries.
This agreement was reached at a meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif in Makkah on Sunday night.
PM Sharif was on a three-day visit to pursue economic support from the kingdom.
According to a joint communique issued simultaneously from Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of the meeting, the two leaders discussed ways for strengthening bilateral ties with special focus on “Kingdom’s supportive role in Pakistan’s economy and the mutual desire to strengthen trade and investment ties”.
“Both parties affirmed their commitment to expediting the first wave of investment package worth $5 billion, which was discussed previously,” the statement added.
It, however, did not mention the sector in which this investment would be made.
Last year Saudi Arabia had promised to invest $25 billion within next five years under the Spe­cial Investment Facilita­tion Council (SIFC) that is seeking investments in the energy, IT, minerals, defence, and agriculture sectors from the Arab countries.
It is expected that the $5bn investment would be made in the minerals sector especially the Reko Diq gold and copper mines as Saudi Arabia has already been studying the prospects of tapping into this sector, though the kingdom also has interest in petroleum, agriculture as well as IT sectors.
Barrick Gold Corp, which holds 50pc shares in Reko Diq mine had in August 2023 indicated that there was a possibility of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund entering the venture through Pakistan’s 25pc equity in the project.

Mr Sharif assured Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Pakistan’s commitment to enhancing economic cooperation with the Saudi kingdom.
The two leaders also discussed the tense ties between India and Pakistan.
“The two sides stressed the importance of dialogue between Pakis­tan and India to resolve the outstanding issues bet­ween the two countries, especially the Jam­mu and Kashmir dispute to ensure peace and stability in the region,” the communique read.
Riyadh has been encou­raging Pakistan to explore avenues for normalisation with India. The Arab leaders, after the elections in India, may play a pivotal role in facilitating engagement bet­ween India and Pakistan, urging both to step back from conflict and military standoffs.
Saudi Arabia’s encouragement of peace between India and Pakistan aligns with its strategic, economic, and geopolitical in­­t­erests, aiming to enha­n­ce regional stability and sec­u­­­re a conducive environment for its Vision 2030 in­­­vestments in South Asia.
This effort also supports its counterterrorism objectives.
Discussing the Pales­t­ine issue, both Pakistan and Saudi premiers urged inte­rnational efforts to halt Israeli military operations in Gaza and mitigate hum­a­nitarian impact. They also called on Israel to cease hostilities, adhere to int­ernational law, and faci­litate unhindered hum­a­nitarian aid access to Gaza.
The two leaders highlighted the need for advancing the peace process in accordance with relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and the General Assem­bly as well as the Arab Peace Initiative, aimed at finding a just and comprehensive solution, for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.

1,"20 convicts in May 9 cases released from jail, govt tells SC",Most of them served around 10 months in jail as the remaining period of their punishment was remitted by COAS.,"ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Monday informed the Supreme Court that 20 persons who were arrested and jailed for their involvement in the May 9 violence have been released so that they could celebrate Eidul Fitr with their family, after they served major part of their sentence while the remaining period of their punishment was remitted by Chief of the Army Staff (COAS).
Among them, four belong to Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa while all other 16 hail from Punjab. They were released in the province of KP and Punjab on April 7 and 6, respectively.
The office of the Atto­rney General for Pakis­tan (AGP) furnished a list of 20 individuals before the Supreme Court to be made part of the record.
Earlier on March 28, a six-judge SC bench headed by Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan had modified its Dec 13, 2023 order that suspended the operation of its Oct 23 decision which nullified the military trial of civilians involved in the May 9 violence.
 
 

Accor­ding to the amended order, a direction was issued that military courts can commence trials but they will not convict or acquit any suspect until the pendency of government-instituted Intra-Court Appeals (ICAs).

Most of them served around 10 months in jail as the remaining period of their punishment was remitted by COAS

AGP Mansoor Usman Awan had told the SC that as per instructions 20 persons could be released before the coming Eid.
The report furnished before the SC stated that in pursuance to its March 28 directions, the military courts were allowed to resume trial and therefore sentences in cases of lesser punishments were handed down. It said 20 persons were awarded sentences of one year of which 17 have served a period of 10.5 months and three persons have served a period of 9.5 months.
While none of the persons have served out a full period of one year, upon confirmation of their sentence, the remaining period of their punishment was remitted by the COAS under Section 143(1)(i) of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 (PAA).
The list of 20 persons whose punishment has been remitted and thus released before Eid was also provided along with the report for the perusal of the court. The statement made by the federal government be­fore the court on March 28 stood complied with the release of the 20 persons before Eid, the report said.
From Punjab, Moham­m­ad Idrees who spent 10 months and eight days in prison, Aswad Rajput who served 10 months and five days, Nadir Khan who served 10 months and six days, Yasir Aman who spent 10 months and nine days, and Sheharyar Zul­fiqar, Lal Shah, Abdur Reh­man and Mohammad Fai­sal who spent 10 months and eight days in prison had been awarded one-year imprisonment, but they were released after they were granted remissions, according to the report.
Likewise, Faisal Irshad and Hassan Shakir spent 10 months and four days in jail while Abdullah Aziz served nine months and 26 days. All three hail from Lahore.
From Gujranwala, Moham­mad Anas, Abdul Jabbar, Abdul Sattar, Mohammad Rashid and Rashid Ali were released after they spent more than 10 months in jail.
From Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s district of Dir, Umar Muhammad served 10 months and 10 days, Khalmat Khan spent 10 months and seven days in jail, while Ijaz-ul-Haq spent nine months and 23 days in prison. Shah Zeb who belongs to Mardan was released after he served nine months and 29 days in jail.

2,Signs point to rare ‘same-day’ Eid,Central moon-sighting body to meet at roof of Federal Secreta­riat’s Kohsar Block in Islamabad.,"ISLAMABAD: As multiple countries across the world decided to celebrate Eidul Fitr on Wednesday (tomorrow) after the crescent was not sighted on Monday, the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee will meet in Islamabad today to spot the Shawwal crescent, giving rise to the possibility of a same-day Eid across the Muslim world.
In addition to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Kuwait will celebrate Eid tomorrow, according to media reports in the Gulf-based newspapers. Simi­larly, Australia has also announced that Eid will be observed on Wednesday.
On the other hand, the central moon-sighting body will meet at the roof of the Federal Secreta­riat’s Kohsar Block in Islamabad, while meetings of zonal and district Ruet-i-Hilal committees will be held at their respective headquarters concurrently. If the committee manages to spot the new moon today, then Pakistan will also celebrate Eid with the rest of the world.
Ruet-i-Hilal Committee
In a statement on Mon­day, the committee requ­es­ted citizens to share any information regarding sightings of the moon with the committees in their respective areas.
The meeting will be chaired by Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad, and atten-ded by the members of the Ruet-i-Hilal Commit­tee, as well as officials from the Meteorological Department, Suparco, and the Ministry of Science and Technology.
Talking to Dawn, Maulana Azad said that extensive meetings and discussions have been held with clerics and religious groups across the country, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
All groups who had apprehensions with the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee in the past have been taken on board and it is unlikely that any cleric would form their private moon sighting committee, he said.
In the past, different parts of the country have observed Eid on different dates owing to differences in moon-sighting evidence and non-adherence to the Central Ruet-i-Hilal committee’s diktat.
Most notably, Peshawar’s Mufti Shahabudin Popalzai would often announce Eid in KP a day ahead of the rest of the country. In 2022, the country saw Eid being celebrated on three different dates in North Waziristan, Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa, and the rest of the country.
A similar situation occurred in 2012, when the residents of the then-tribal areas celebrated Eid on Aug 18, KP announced Eid on Aug 19 and the rest of the country celebrated on Aug 20.
Muslim world
According to the UAE-based newspaper The National, a group of astronomers, court officials and advisers from the Emirates’ Islamic authority — gathered to observe the crescent heralding the start of Shawwal, the 10th month of the Islamic calendar.
“As the moon could not be sighted, Tuesday will be the 30th and final day of Ramazan this year,” it reported.
The Arab News, while quoting the Saudi Supreme Court, said that the Shawwal crescent was not sighted on Monday evening. Tuesday will be the final day of the holy month, it reported.
The Gulf Times reported that the Crescent Sighting Committee at the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs in Qatar announced that April 9 will be the last day of the blessed month of Ramazan and that Wednesday, April 10, will be the first day of Eid.
According to Gulf News, “Aus­tralia has officially announced Wednesday as the first day of Eid Al Fitr, marking the end of Ramazan and the beginning of the month of Shawwal.”

3,Complaint against IHC judge Mohsin Akhtar Kay­ani lands before Supreme Judicial Council,Justice Kayani was among six judges who wrote letter on ‘meddling’ allegations.,"ISLAMABAD: A former official of the Islam­abad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) has moved the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) aga­inst senior puisne judge Mohsin Akhtar Kay­ani — who is among the six judges who recently wrote a letter to the SJC detailing alleged harassment at the hands of state institutions.
IHCBA former general secretary Mohammad Waqas alleged that IHC Justice Kayani “waged a war against the forces of Pakistan in a planned manner by inducing and convincing other judges of high court”.
The complaint said that “the action of the learned judge… is not initiated in good faith as he is facing ‘references’ questioning his integrity and conduct as a judge”.
An earlier reference revolved around the lawyers of the chamber where Justice Kayani was practising law before his appointment to the IHC.

Justice Kayani was among six judges who wrote letter on ‘meddling’ allegations

The complaint highlighted a quarrel between the special prosecutor of the Benazir murder case, Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali, and the associates of the law chamber in question. A case in this regard was registered at the Margalla police station.
The complaint claimed that intelligence agencies were required to keep a check on the ‘criminal intents’ of judges, but they had failed to do so.
It claimed that the letter attempted to provoke the sentiments of the people affiliated with a political party and, in fact has mali­gned the prestigious office of a judge by indulging in political affairs for his personal gains. It requested proceedings aga­i­nst the judge under Article 209.
Last month, six IHC judges accused the country’s intelligence apparatus of interference in judicial affairs, including attempts to pressure judges through abduction and torture of their relatives and secret surveillance inside their homes.
The letter, addressed to Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Supreme Court judges Mansoor Ali Shah and Munib Akhtar and chief justices of the IHC and Peshawar High Court, also questioned if there “exists a state police to intimidate and coerce judges”.
In addition to Justice Kayani, the letter dated March 25 was also signed by Justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir, and Saman Rafat Imtiaz of the IHC.

4,Rs4.92 per unit extra for electricity used in Feb,"Move to impact consumers of all ex-Wapda Discos, generating net financial impact of about Rs45bn.","ISLAMABAD: Consu­mers will pay Rs4.92 per unit extra next month for electricity consumed in February, after the power regulator approved the hike as additional fuel cost adjustment (FCA).
The National Electric Power Regulatory Autho­rity (Nepra) notified the increase on Monday. It will impact consumers of all ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos), generating a net financial impact of about Rs45bn.
The net tariff increase because of the FCA impact would be about Rs7.51 per unit owing to its partial spillover to the upcoming quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA), as explained by the regulator during a public hearing on March 28.
The adjustment will be applicable to “all the consumer categories except Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and lifeline consumers”, said the Nepra’s notification.
Earlier, the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), on behalf of Discos, had sought an additional FCA of Rs4.99 per unit for the electricity consumed in February.
It claimed that the reference fuel cost for January was set at Rs4.43 per unit, but the actual fuel cost more than doubled to Rs9.42 per unit.
The additional FCA is about 113pc higher than the pre-fixed fuel cost of Rs4.43 per unit already charged to consumers in February.
After minor deductions, the regulator worked out the total per unit fuel cost at Rs9.35 and allowed Rs4.92 per unit additional FCA — 7 paise per unit lower than the Discos’ demand.
Poor fuel price calculations
It also calls into question the capabilities of the power sector bureaucracy to forecast fuel costs even for six to seven months.
The additional FCAs have remained over 80pc higher in recent months than pre-determined fuel costs notified at the start of the fiscal year.
This increase in FCA is on top of about 26pc inc­rease in annual base tariff and another 16pc hike under quarterly tariff adj­u­stment already in place.
As a result, consumers would continue to pay excessive bills despite lower consumption. This was despite the fact that more than 77pc share of electricity came from local resources.
The higher FCA for Feb 2024 was mainly because of the adverse fuel mix than estimated and higher domestic coal and gas prices, although imported fuel prices, including furnace oil and LNG, were lower in February, and the exchange rate remained stable.
The actual supply from cheaper hydropower and domestic coal was about 2pc and 5pc lower than reference estimates, respectively, while imported coal’s share was also about 6pc lower.
On the other hand, the share of RLNG-based supply went beyond 20pc of the national grid, although it was estimated to be zero.
The nuclear supply to the grid was also lower than the reference estimate.
‘Concerns’ at low demand
Besides, the regulator expressed serious concerns over the constantly declining electricity demand.
Till February 2024, the overall demand had reduced by around 12pc compared to reference projections.
“This decrease in sales would consequently result in higher quarterly adjustments, leading to further increase in tariff”, the regulator noted and directed the CPPA and Ministry of Energy to analyse the impact of ending commercial-based load-shedding and submit a proposal to improve the demand.
It was also highlighted that currently, capacity charges constitute over 60pc of the tariff, much higher than international standards.
The regulator also asked the CPPA and the government “to evaluate the possibilities of reducing capacity charges while remaining within the legal framework”.
The Nepra also expressed displeasure that supply from wind-based power plants was being curtailed, leading to the functioning of power plants running on expensive imported fuel.
It was also observed that the Guddu Thermal Power Station was being operated on a 45pc plant factor on open cycle instead of combined cycle.
Had this plant been running on combined cycle, it would have reduced the cost of generation since it was a more efficient process.
The power regulator also noted the National Transmission and Despatch Company’s version that the constraint in the North-South corridor was due to national generation coming at the low of 7,000 to 8,000 MW, even though the system had a 27,000MW evacuation capacity.
Ironically, $655 million were spent on developing the corridor’s extension which would not be required beyond 2030 due to new hydel power plants coming in the northern region.

5,Upper House meets today to pick its custodians,Gilani looks set to become Senate chairman; PML-N staying mum on its candidate for deputy chairman.,"• Gilani looks set to become Senate chairman; PML-N staying mum on its candidate for deputy chairman
• 43 senators-elect to take oath; PTI boycotts ‘unconstitutional’ election
ISLAMABAD: Amid a boycott by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the upper house of parliament is expected to elect its chairman and deputy chairman on Tuesday almost one month after it became dysfunctional following the retirement of half of its members on March 11.
As many as 43 senators will take oath as members of the house before a schedule is announced for elections to the offices of chairman and deputy chairman the same day.
According to a statement issued by the Senate Secretariat, the upper house will meet at 9am today (Tuesday) and after the oath-taking, the announ­cement regarding the schedule for the election of the chairman and the deputy chairman will be made at 12:30pm.
In the absence of any opposition, the ruling alliance is poised to clinch the slot, with the chairmanship likely going to PPP’s Yousaf Raza Gilani and the deputy chairmanship to a PML-N candidate. The PML-N has yet to announce its nominee, however.
According to the PPP leaders, their campaign to secure victory for Mr Gilani as the chairman of the Senate was in full swing and a special committee had reached out to other political parties to ensure the PPP lawmaker’s win.
According to PPP leader Sherry Rehman, Mr Gilani enjoys significant support within the Senate, and the PPP will formally declare its support for him on April 9, along with its allied parties.
On the other hand, the PTI has decided to continue with its boycott in light of the postponement of Senate elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The polls on 11 seats could not be held after the KP speaker did not administer oath to lawmakers elected on reserved seats. These seats were doled out to the PPP, PML-N, and other parties after the ECP rejected a plea by the PTI and SIC for the allocation of these seats.
 
 

A PTI spokesperson said that the election for the posts of the chairman and deputy chairman of the Senate without representations from all federating units was “unconstitutional and unacceptable”.
He vowed that the PTI would not tolerate “the insult of the upper house to select unelected persons on the constitutional positions of the state from the incomplete electoral college”.
He lamented that the process of violation of the Constitution and democratic principles by the unconstitutional government of ‘Form-47’ continued sans any interval. The spokesperson said that after the postponement of the Senate election in KP, the election of the chairman and deputy chairman of the Senate was a continuation of the “conspiracy to ambush the public mandate”.
He went on to say that keeping an “important federating unit out of the electoral process was part of the nefarious and shameful attempts of a biased group to sow the seed of provincial discard and hatred”.
Senate conundrum
The term of a senator is six years, but half of the lawmakers retire every three years and elections are held to fill the vacancies. These elections normally take place days before the expiry of the senators’ term, but that could not happen this time. The unique situation came about in the absence of an electoral college caused by the failure of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold timely general elections.
Since elections are not to be held on four seats that used to be reserved for the erstwhile tribal areas, as these have been abolished following their merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa under the 25th Amendment, polling to fill 48 vacancies was to be held on April 2.
Out of them, 18 senators had been elected unopposed and elections on 11 Senate seats from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been postponed owing to a controversy surrounding the oaths to the members of the provincial assembly elected on reserved seats.
