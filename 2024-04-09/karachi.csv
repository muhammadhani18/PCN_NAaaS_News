0,SHC orders authorities to impound vehicles carrying more than permitted load,Asks govt to submit monthly report,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has directed the authorities to not allow vehicles carrying more than permitted load on city roads and highways.  
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan also sought monthly reports regarding such illegal acts.  
Citing the ministry of communication, National Highway Authority, works & services department of Sindh and others as respondents, the all dumper tuck transport owners’ association had petitioned the SHC last year challenging a notification empowering the authorities to levy penalty which the petitioner termed ‘contrary to legal regime’.  
The bench in its order said that after hearing the matter at length it transpired that the petitioner had not approached the court ‘with clean hands’.  

Asks govt to submit monthly report

“It is an admitted fact that the petitioners load their vehicles/dumpers above the permitted load and ply these vehicles on the highways as well as on city roads which not only becomes dangerous to themselves but as well as the roads and other vehicles”, it added.  
The bench noted that Section 76(3) of the Motor Vehicle Ordinance, 1965 was regarding limits of weight and limitation on use of heavy transport and barred driving overloaded vehicles or trailers.  
It also observed that as per a research, the twelfth schedule of the ordinance has made provisions for payment of fine under Section 122 and 16-A for overloading vehicles only in Punjab and Islamabad.  
“But the fact remains that no such possibility is envisaged under Section 76(3) of the Ordinance, which gives us reason to believe that over-loaded vehicles should not be permitted to be driven on the roads at all and be impounded”, it added.  
The bench also noted that the lawyer for petitioner had failed to satisfy as to why petitioners overload vehicles on highways and city roads which itself was a serious illegality.  
“It is thus ordered that vehicles plying over and above the permitted load either be trucks, buses, trailers or dumpers, etc shall not be permitted on the highways and city roads at all and monthly reports be submitted to MIT-II [member inspection team] of this court without fail for such illegal acts and impoundments made”, it concluded.

The spokesperson expressed utter shock at the government failure to tackle the escalating crime rate in Karachi. The first quarter of 2024 has followed the same pattern, it said.
While vigilantism and increased brutality in response by citizens is not the answer, the government’s failure to address rising crime levels is shocking, it said and asked the government to address urgently the underlying factors such as economic desperation and unemployment.

8,Sindh rights body takes up death of two sanitation workers with labour secretary,"SHRC sees violation of laws, rules leading to recurrence of such incidents","HYDERABAD: The Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has asked secretary of the labour and human resource department for an investigation into the Sunday incident, where two sanitation workers died while clearing a manhole outside a factory in the SITE area of Hyderabad. 
The rights commission has sought a report, to be prepared by an officer well-conversant with facts about the incident, by April 19.
SHRC chairman Iqbal Detho issued such letter on Monday. He reminded the Sindh labour department secretary that several such fatal incidents had been reported from Karachi and Hyderabad in the recent past, and noted with concern that sanitation workers had to undertake the job of clearing sewerage lines and manholes without adequate safety gears.
The commission had earlier raised the matter through its letters dated Jan 23 and March 27 and put forward recommendations to relevant provincial authorities, including the labour secretary, the SHRC recalled. 

SHRC sees violation of laws, rules leading to recurrence of such incidents

It noted that the local government secretary had also issued necessary directives to his department’s regional directors in this regard on Jan 29. But the labour department, the SHRC chairman regretted, did not passed on such instructions to its regional directors. 
This oversight led to a lack of monitoring and has now resulted in the tragic death of two more sanitation workers on Sunday, according to him.
He pointed out that Amir Johnson, 25, and his cousin Zohi Robin, 26, lost their lives by inhaling toxic gases accumulated in the manhole, located in front of a factory, while trying to clear it.
Violation of law 
The SHRC, in its latest communication, observed that it was not an isolated incident because several sanitation workers had lost their lives in the past while cleaning sewerage lines without being provided Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) under the Sindh Occupation Safety and Health Act, 2017.
It repeated its earlier observation that standards of occupational safety were completely ignored by the officials concerned while asking sanitation workers to enter sewer manhole due to which their lives were endangered. 
It termed the officials’ negligence “violation of Article 9 (right to life) & 14 (right to dignity) of Constitution”.
The commission reminded the officials concerned that The Sindh Occupational Safety and Health Act, 2017 was promulgated on Dec 26, 2017 to ensure provision of occupational safety and health conditions at all workplaces “for protection of persons at work against risk of injury arising out of activities at work places and for promotion of safe, healthy and decent working environment adapted to physical, physiological and psychological needs of all persons at work”.
It quoted various rules in this regard under multiple laws dealing with conditions dangerous to life or health. 
Implementation of laws stressed
SHRC chairman Iqbal Detho told the labour secretary that the commission had taken cognizance of the recurring incidents, and stressed on the implementation of the Sindh Occupational Safety and Health Act-2017 and the rules laid down in 2019. 
He said that these measures were crucial to safeguard lives and wellbeing of sanitation workers in Sindh. 
He also referred to his Jan 23 letter addressed to Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab, the additional chief secretary of local government and managing directors of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board and Water and Sanitation Agency about its recommendations for the implementation of the Act and rules. He has also attached with the communication his Jan 27 letter addressed to all relevant authorities.

11,"PPP lost right to rule after failing to ensure citizens safety, security: SUP","Claim lawlessness worsened across Sindh, corruption plagued all departments during all three terms of the party","DADU: Sindh United Party President Syed Zain Shah has demanded the Pakistan Peoples Party’s Sindh government tender resignation over its utter failure to control unbridled rise in crimes and maintain law and order in the province.
Mr Shah said at a public gathering in Bhan Syedabad town on Monday that law and order conditions had only gotten worse across the province during the last 15 years of PPP rule.
He said that street crimes had proliferated in urban centres and kidnapping for ransom had become order of the day in rural areas. People were nowhere safe, neither on roads, streets and markets nor even in the four walls of their homes, he lamented.
He said that Sindh government had forfeited its right to rule as it had miserably failed to control crimes even after having three interrupted tenures in the province. Hence, Sindh government’s ministers should all tender resignation, he said. 

Claim lawlessness worsened across Sindh, corruption plagued all departments during all three terms of the party

He said that police officers, from IGP down to an SHO, were posted in the province over political considerations. Services of police officers were exploited in elections to ensure victories of PPP candidates, he claimed.
He said that police only supported PPP-linked officers hence it had lost the ability to establish peace. Economic instability in the country was fueling an increase in terrorist activities along border areas, he said.
He said that the country had ‘controlled’ democracy where election results were changed or stolen to facilitate favourite candidates’ wins. Present rulers had no capability to rule the country hence they were only adding to anarchy, he said. 
Shah said that corruption had increased and basic rights of people had been violated. Mega corruption had been committed in development schemes for roads, hospitals, drainage and water supply, he said.
He said the province had bumper wheat crop this year despite all odds and millions of tonnes of wheat was lying in fields but officials of food department were not ready to buy the grain from growers and the gunny bags meant for distribution among growers were illegally being sold to traders and middlemen.
He said that in the absence of procurement centres traders were purchasing the grain from growers at lower rates and selling the same to food department at official rate thus killing the very purpose of the exercise of fixation of support price, distribution of gunny bags among growers and opening of procurement centres. 
SUP senior vice president Roshan Ali Buriro said that economic crisis had deepened during the long PPP rule in Sindh, forcing the jobless and the helpless to commit suicide.

Police identified the victims as 30-year-old Zakir and 55-year-old Sher Alam and said that they were associated with the poultry business.
DIG-South Syed Asad Raza said that the incident took place at 9:35am when armed robbers intercepted their car near Fatima Masjid in Metroville, shot dead the two men and took away Rs12.6m.
He said that the victims were transporting the cash from their office and it appeared that the robbers already knew about their route.
“We cannot rule out the involvement of an organised group in this brazen attack,” the DIG told Dawn.

Police say victims were transporting cash in their car without security

He said that the victims were shot in the head and upper body from both sides of the vehicle and from the front. There was no evidence that the victims put up resistance, he added.
Five spent bullet casings fired from 9mm pistols were recovered from the crime scene, the police said.
He said a joint investigation team had been formed and the analysis of their route and geo-fencing were being undertaken.
“This is not an ordinary street crime… the killers on the basis of their information targeted the employees of the poultry farm to loot the cash,” he said.
The DIG said that the local police station should have been informed or at least private security guards should have been hired before transporting such a huge amount.
“We will interrogate all persons associated with this case,” he said.
Meanwhile, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar took notice of the incident and ordered suspension of the SHO of the SITE-A police station.
Separately, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah sought a report from the inspector general of police about the murder of two citizens by robbers.
He said such incidents were not ‘tolerable’. He directed the IGP to enhance police patrolling in the city.
Later in the day, the CM chaired a meeting where he expressed concern over the increasing street crime in the city and kidnapping for ransom in the riverine area.
He told Karachi police chief Imran Yaqoob Minhas that every day people were being killed for resisting robberies. “This is quite painful and it becomes our responsibility to protect the life, liberty and property of the citizens,” he said.
He emphasised that the police, with the support of Rangers and other law enforcement agencies, must take strict actions to eliminate the criminals.
He said that he had sent IGP Ghulam Nabi to visit the riverine area and ensure the safe recovery of kidnapped persons.

17,"SC gives PEC, Sindh govt two months to provide relief to over 6,900 displaced families","On court order, LG dept writes to engineering council to seek cost of construction on 80 sq-yd plot for victims of demolition","KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Monday directed the provincial government and the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) to complete within two months the entire process to estimate the cost of construction of houses for over 6,900 families rendered homeless by a demolition drive carried out along three major drains in the city.
The apex court also asked the provincial authorities to address the grievances of certain affectees after they submitted that their names had been mentioned in the verified list, but they had not been accommodated yet.
At the previous hearing, the Supreme Court had directed the chief secretary to obtain an estimate regarding the cost of construction on an 80-square-yard plot after the counsel for the affectees submitted that despite a court order, the Sindh government was getting the cost estimates from its own consultants instead of the PEC.
When a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar took up the contempt applications against Sindh government functionaries for hearing on Monday at the apex court’s Karachi registry, the chief secretary and advocate general placed in court a copy of the letter written to the PEC to provide the estimated/average cost of construction.

On court order, LG dept writes to engineering council to seek cost of construction on 80 sq-yd plot for victims of demolition drive 

The bench was informed that on April 8 (Monday), the special local government secretary had communicated to the PEC chairman to furnish average cost of construction of a house on an 80 square yards plot.
They also submitted that the requirements of construction with specification for a house on ground floor would be forwarded by the provincial government to the PEC.
Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah said that he would make a request to the PEC to give its opinion within a period of three weeks.
The bench said that once the opinion of the estimated cost was received by the Sindh government, a copy of the same must be provided to the counsel for affectees.
The apex court also directed the PEC to call a meeting of the representatives of the Sindh government and affectees within a period of two weeks and after the meeting, a final estimated cost would be issued by the PEC.
“The entire process shall be completed within a period of two months and thereafter the matter be listed for hearing,” the bench added.
Many other people also approached the apex court and their lawyer pointed out that certain affectees, whose names were already mentioned in the verification list of Gujjar Nullah affectees, had not been accommodated.
An additional advocate general submitted that such affectees may approach the focal person to chief secretary Syed Mohsin Hussain Shah for verification and they would be accommodated if found genuine.
The bench directed the affectees to approach the focal person.
A large number of the affected people, including women, had staged protests outside the apex court building on every hearing against the government for failing to rehabilitate them despite the passage of around three years and several of them had been complaining that their homes were also demolished, but they have yet to get any compensation on the account of rental support or accommodation despite approaching the officials concerned.
The demolition drive was carried out on the orders of the Supreme Court along three major nullahs of the city in order to expand the drains.
In 2021, the apex court had ordered the provincial and local authorities for compensation and rehabilitation of the affected and displaced families.
Thereafter, in August last year, during the hearing of an application seeking contempt proceedings against CM Murad Ali Shah for not complying with the orders of the apex court, the provincial authorities had forwarded proposals that the government would release amounts to each of the affected family for purchase of land and construction according to market value of land from where affectees were dispossessed.
About the cost of construction, the standards laid down by the PEC for construction of house measuring 80 square yards, would be followed, it added.
As an alternative, the Sindh government would allot a plot measuring 80 square yards to each of such families and after handing over peaceful vacant possession of such plots, the cost of construction would also be paid to each of families in accordance with the standards set out by the PEC. The affectees and their counsel opted for the second proposal.

18,Giant blue whale sighted off Gadani coast,Local fishermen had also spotted the largest animal on earth a day earlier.,"KARACHI: A giant blue whale was spotted and recorded on camera by fishermen two kilometres off the coast of Gadani, Balochistan, on Monday morning.
The largest animals to have ever lived on earth, blue whales are listed endangered on the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List of Species and there are around 10,000 to 25,000 specimens worldwide.
According to local fishermen, they saw the same whale along Gadani’s coast at around 4:40pm on Sunday. But, they were not able to record it on camera at that time.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“It’s the second time the live sighting of a blue whale has been recorded on camera in Pakistani waters,” Muhammad Moazzam Khan, technical adviser of World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-P) said, adding that species was the second most common whale in Pakistan’s waters after the Arabian humpback whale.

Local fishermen had also spotted the largest animal on earth a day earlier

According to him, there is a sizable population of blue whales in the Arabian Sea as local fishermen have reported several sightings of the animal during the last 15 years.
Mr Khan recalled that a gigantic mother blue whale with her calf was sighted off Churna Island near the Karachi coast in September 2017.
He hoped that the giant whale would maneuver and find its way into the deep waters as the Gadani area had many physical barriers such as shipbreaking activities, Single Point Mooring (SPM), reception facilities for the coal power plant and some construction-related barges and tugs.
“The area from where the blue whale is recorded is part of the Churna-Kaio Island Complex Area of Interest and is adjacent to the North East Arabian Sea Important Marine Mammal Area, a region identified and declared by the Marine Mammal Protected Area Task Force of International Union for Conservation of Nature,” Mr Khan explained.
Commenting on the whale’s sighting, Ghazi Salahuddin, regional head, Sindh and Balochistan WWF-P, said whales faced several challenges along their habitat range.
“The major threats to whales in Pakistan’s waters include entanglement in the fishing nets, ship strikes, pollution and climate change. As blue whales are migratory species, we need to promote new conservation approaches through enhancing cooperation from local to regional and international levels,” he emphasised.
Science-based and research organisations, civil society, states, and inter-governmental bodies should play their role to safeguard whale species, Mr Salahudding added.
“The WWF-Pakistan through its Observer Programme is building the capacity of local fishermen to safely release the entangled whales, dolphins, turtles and other threatened marine species from fishing nets, film the sighting of endangered species and make efforts for the protection.”
According to experts, blue whales live in all the world’s oceans, except the Arctic, occasionally swimming in small groups but usually alone or in pairs. They often spend summers feeding in polar waters and undertake lengthy migrations towards the Equator as winter arrives. They are among the loudest animals on earth.
“These magnificent marine mammals rule the oceans at up to 100 feet long and upwards of 200 tonnes. Their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant. Their hearts, as much as an automobile.”
“Blue whales reach these mind-boggling dimensions on a diet composed nearly exclusively of tiny shrimp like animals called krill. During certain times of the year, a single adult blue whale consumes about four tonnes of krill a day,” says the National Geographic website.

Official sources said that a meeting, held to review the progress of the Strengthening Social Protection Delivery System in Sindh (SSPDS) with Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah in chair, was told that the MCSP had been introduced to encourage pregnant women and mothers of under two-year-old children to utilise maternal, new-born, and child healthcare services (MNCH) throughout the continuum of care for 1,000 days/ three years from conception.
The programme will also provide conditional cash transfers to support and strengthen the scale of the MCSP.
The chief minister was told that an amount of Rs285. 656m had been released for cash transfer and of them, Rs163.584m had been transferred and the remaining was being transferred.
The chief minister instructed the social protection department to issue CNICs to those mothers who did not have them so that they could take advantage of the project.
The meeting was attended among others by Principal Secretary to CM Agha Wasif, Social Protection Secretary Rafiq Mustafa Shaikh and Social Protection Authority Chief Executive Officer Samiullah Shaikh.
The meeting was told that MCSP had a budget of $201.85m to strengthen and expand the existing programme by providing conditional cash transfers to pregnant women and mothers of children under two years old.
It was informed that the SSPDS had been launched with the International Development Association (IDA).
The IDA has funded $200m and counterpart funding of the provincial government share is $30m, which shows that the project cost is $230m. The project will be implemented over five years (2023-2027).
Social protection secretary told the meeting that the MCSP, which had been piloted in districts Umerkot and Tharparkar in 2021, offered cost-effective instruments for increasing the uptake of these essential services by poor rural households.
He said that the beneficiaries of the MCSP would avail WHO-recommended MNCH services throughout the continuum of care for 1,000 days from conception and are considered essential for the well-being of the mother, new-born and child.
The SPA CEO told the CM that a total of 16 touchpoints had been identified throughout the 1,000 days. Those included antenatal, safe deliveries, postnatal maternal and new-born check-ups, and child growth and immunisation monitoring.
He said that the 15 poorest districts – Umerkot, Tharparkar, Mirpurkhas, Tando Mohammad Khan, Matiari, Tando Allahyar, Sujawal, Thatta, Badin, Sanghar, Kahsmore, Jacobabad, Shikarpur and Kambar-Shahdadkot – were selected based on the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) to roll out the program.
