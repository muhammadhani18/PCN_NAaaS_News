1,Moti Bazaar offers respite from inflation,The ancient marketplace sells locally sourced products at the cheapest prices for Eid shoppers,"Moti Bazaar, an ancient market renowned for women's clothes, has emerged as a beacon of hope and solace for shoppers concerned about inflation during Eid festivities.
Many female shoppers are flocking to Moti Bazaar in search of affordable options for their Eid shopping. In response to the surge of women, the bazaar management has enforced a prohibition on men entering through any of the entrance gates. Only shopkeepers and salesmen will be granted entry to the bazaar until midnight.
Moti Bazaar stands as a historical marketplace offering a wide range of women's and children's clothing, cosmetics and artificial jewellery at competitive prices compared to other markets.
Zainab Bibi, a homemaker busy shopping at Moti Bazaar, while speaking to The Express Tribune mentioned that she had come to Moti Bazaar with her three daughters for Eid shopping. She said, “The prices of items for women and children at Moti Bazaar were quite reasonable compared to commercial markets like Saddar or Tench Bhatta Bazar”.
She emphasised that in Moti Bazaar, one could easily purchase two suits, shoes, jewellery, make-up, and other items for the three days of Eid within the rate of Rs 5,000, whereas the same items would cost around Rs50,000 in other markets or branded shops.
Zainab Bibi also stated that women from all walks of life visit Moti Bazaar for shopping, and as Eid approaches, traders offer various offers that benefit the customers.
Ian Younis, who was shopping alongside her mother, mentioned that, like every year, she intends to complete all her shopping at Moti Bazar.
Moti Bazaar's most remarkable aspect is its extensive range of clothing options. From hosiery to hand-crafted clothes, one can find a diverse selection. Furthermore, if a desired item is not readily accessible, the traders capture its photograph and collaborate with their skilled artisans to recreate the same product.
Yasir Butt, a trader specialising in the sale of women's clothing in Moti Bazaar, expressed his belief that Moti Bazaar plays a crucial role in supporting underprivileged women and families. Moti Bazaar is a wholesale business centre catering to bulk buyers and retail customers.
To ensure the safety and convenience of female shoppers amidst the current bustling atmosphere, trade organisations have taken measures to enhance the lighting arrangements. Entrances are guarded by security personnel equipped with additional lamps, strictly prohibiting the entry of men.
Yasir anticipates a further surge in footfall in the coming days, and the traders are fully prepared. Shopping continues in the market all night till Suhoor time.

3,Anti-polio drive to persist through Eid break,"As festive season sees families come to Pindi, risk of virus spread rises","Under a new plan the anti-polio campaign is to be conducted at all bus stands, public parks and railway stations throughout the three days of Eid and is to continue at designated special points until April 20.
During Eid, there is a higher risk of polio virus spreading as families come from other cities to mingle with relatives in the Rawalpindi district.
In preparation for the season of increased polio risk, the District Health Authority has cancelled the leave of all field staff while laying down a plan to continue work under the anti-polio campaign during Eid.
Special points have been established in this regard, where polio teams have been deputed. These special points have been established at bus stands, railway stations, public parks and hospitals for administering polio drops.
According to the Head of the Punjab Polio Eradication Program, Khizar Iqbal, in cities where environmental samples for polio virus have tested positive, 92 sites have been marked for administering polio drops to children.
Over 500 polio workers will perform duties at these sites, which will cater to children accompanying families coming from outside the cities. This initiative will continue during the Eid holidays and will conclude on April 20.
“Administering polio drops at polio vaccination sites will help prevent the spread of the poliovirus,” Iqbal affirmed. The District Health Authority Chief Executive, Dr Ijaz Ahmed, stated that those involved in the polio vaccination campaign during the Eid holidays have been made aware of their responsibilities. He himself will also monitor the campaign on-field. He also reported that so far, the environmental samples sent have tested negative.

5,Golra SHO suspended,DIG Operations visited Golra Police Station and suspended SHO Golra Police Station Safdar Hussain for poor performance,"Rawalpindi SSP Operations Syed Shehzad Nadeem Bukhari suspended the SHO of Golra Police Station on Tuesday.
The official took action on the news published in The Express Tribune regarding the Swiss tourist woman and her five friends who were robbed at gunpoint when they were on their way to see the Budhha stupa in Taxila through Shah Allah Ditta hiking track, within the limits of Golra Police station, Islamabad.

DIG Shehzad Nadeem Bukhari, while addressing the officials of Golra police station, reprimanded the inactive SHO and the entire staff of the station, saying that whether Shah Allah Ditta Hiking Trail falls within the limits of Islamabad or Taxila, tourists using the boundaries of Islamabad for hiking trails are parking their cars in the hiking trails' parking lots. It is the responsibility of Islamabad police to ensure the safety of these tourists. DIG Operations further said that departmental action will be taken against SHOs who fail to prevent crimes across the district.
A senior officer of the Federal Police informed The Express Tribune that the news published in the Monday edition of Express Tribune was addressed.

6,"Beauty products, salons not spared by inflation","Despite exorbitant prices, women remain undeterred this Eid season","Inflation has hit everything from women’s beauty products to salon services which are especially in demand during Eid season.
The beauty salon business has seen an increase in the twin cities during this time and a 50% hike has accordingly been observed in their service rates. However, customers remain undeterred and there is hardly any room in salons in Rawalpindi as women wait in line for their turn despite having booked appointments beforehand.
Booking fees are collected separately by salons through Easypaisa or Jazz Cash. Presently, average rates for a haircut range from Rs800 to Rs1,200, however, specifically requested haircuts can set customers back up to Rs1,400.
Rates for whitening facial range from Rs2,500 to Rs3,000, and Rs1,000 to Rs1,200 for plain facial, while only face cleansing can cost between Rs1,000 and Rs1,200. Manicure and pedicure charges are Rs3,000. Getting upper lips done costs Rs200 and eyebrow threading costs Rs300. Henna application, which is highly popular during the Eid season is being offered at the rate of Rs500, but requesting special designs can cost up to Rs1,300 per hand’s side.
In big beauty salons, slots are already completely booked since 10am on Tuesday (yesterday) to 10am on Wednesday. There is also an option to get urgent bookings, but it comes at an additional fee of Rs1,000 to Rs3,000.
The inflation has led many women to start offering beauty services from their home in neighbourhood streets at rates that are 50% than the current market rate.
Rawalpindi Beauty Parlor Union Secretary General, Nida Mumtaz, while speaking to The Express Tribune said that during this Eid season, the prices of all kinds of beauty creams, powders and chemicals have increased by a record 1,000% in comparison to the last decade.
She also said that there is a shortage of female workers, which is another reason for the expensive rates. The increase in prices of beauty products and services has also hiked the price of bridal packages which is currently being offered at Rs50,000 for a simple look, but can range from anywhere between Rs0.1 million to Rs0.5 million for heavier looks and styling.
Inflation dampens Eid spirit
With the advent of Eidul Fitr, the burden of inflation weighs heavily on middle-class families, making traditional Eid shopping an arduous task.
Prices for essential items such as clothing, footwear, cosmetics, bangles, and jewellery have soared, leaving citizens, particularly women, grappling with financial strain as they navigated the bustling markets.
With Eid festivities just around the corner, citizens began flocking to markets adorned with colourful stalls in anticipation of the celebration. However, the relentless surge in inflation casts a shadow of concern over both consumers and traders alike.
While an array of new fashion trends and designer items catered to individuals of all ages, the exorbitant prices placed them out of reach for the middle class. Parents, facing diminished purchasing power, fond themselves sacrificing personal needs to ensure their children’s Eid joy remained intact.
During a survey conducted by The Express Tribune, parents like Muhammad Nadine, Ali, and Afzal, who visited Saddar Bazar with their children for Eid shopping, voiced their distress over the escalating costs. They lamented the inability to indulge in personal purchases, focusing solely on fulfilling their children’s desires amid the festive season.
Amidst other financial obligations, the additional strain of inflated prices has further compounded the worries of citizens. Shopkeepers on Bank Road echoed similar concerns, noting a decline in sales as customers limit purchases to essentials.
Raja Farrukh, a businessman, acknowledged the pervasive anxiety caused by inflation but emphasised the resilience of shoppers, particularly in ensuring their children’s happiness during Eid. Despite the challenges, shopkeepers have adjusted profit margins in a bid to accommodate customers and uphold the spirit of the festival.
Yet, the joy of Eid has been overshadowed by the harsh realities of inflation, leaving many middle-class families unable to partake in customary celebrations. With their cherished traditions at stake, parents appeal to the government for relief measures to alleviate the financial strain and restore the essence of Eid festivities.
