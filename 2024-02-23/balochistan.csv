0,‘Pakistan can’t give up coal power plants early’,CPPA-G Specialist Asadullah pointed out that energy access and affordability are the leading challenges in the country,"Experts at a public-private dialogue called for opting for innovative financing mechanisms and technological transformation to upscale renewable energy resources for a just and clean energy transition in the country.
The dialogue titled: ""Beginning of the End Transitioning away from Coal: Forging an Orderly, Equitable and Just Energy Transition in Pakistan"", was organised by Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) as part of its Clean Energy Transition Programme on Wednesday.
The dialogue aimed to share the preliminary findings of an ongoing SDPI study with the stakeholders.
Ali Nawaz, Director-General (Coal), Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB), Ministry of Energy (Power Division) said that if we do a regional comparison, the coal power generation in Pakistan is way less than in other regional countries. “The coal power projects brought a paradigm shift in the lives of local communities of Thar region through their corporate social responsibility initiatives.”

Pakistan needs huge financing for early retirement of coal power plants, he said, adding that the coal contributes to the energy security of Pakistan and its early retirement will pose bigger challenges, especially since the coal fleet of Pakistan is young, highly efficient, high on merit, and has legal constraints.
Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G) Specialist (Market Pricing & Simulations) Asadullah pointed out that energy access and affordability are the leading challenges in the country. He said the cost of externalities such as environmental social footprint is not a part of the government’s planning, whereas there is a need to develop such financial models. “Environmental sustainability should be our priority that is now the future,” he said. He maintained that the local coal resources are considered reliable, as they have limited effect on foreign exchange reserves and ensure the economic security of the country.
Asian Development Bank’s Senior Project Officer Ehtasham Khattak said the objective is not only to transition away from coal but to transition towards low-carbon fuels. 
“It is incumbent upon the government to address concerns of the communities whose resources are being utilised for power generation,” he added.

1,"Sleepless night can reverse depression for days, study finds",While researchers do not fully understand why sleep loss causes this effect in the brain,"While waking up all night can exhaust you both mentally and physically, an interesting study claims that it can lift your mood for days.
In a new study, neurobiologists at Northwestern University in the US induced mild, acute sleep deprivation in mice and then examined their behaviours and brain activity. The new findings, published online in the journal Neuron, could help researchers better understand how mood states transition naturally.
It could also lead to a more complete understanding of how fast-acting anti-depressants work and help researchers identify previously unknown targets for new antidepressant medications, Medical Daily reported.
“Chronic sleep loss is well studied, and its uniformly detrimental effects are widely documented,” said Professor Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy at the varsity. “But brief sleep loss, like the equivalent of a student pulling an all-nighter before an exam, is less understood. We found that sleep loss induces a potent anti-depressant effect and rewires the brain. This is an important reminder of how our casual activities, such as a sleepless night, can fundamentally alter the brain in as little as a few hours.”

In the research, the team developed a new experiment to induce acute sleep loss in mice that did not have genetic predispositions related to human mood disorders. 
The experimental setup needed to be gentle enough to avoid causing substantial stress for the animals but just uncomfortable enough to prevent the animals from falling asleep. After a sleepless night, the animals’ behaviour shifted to become more aggressive and hyperactive, compared to controls that experienced a typical night’s sleep. Using optical and genetically encoded tools, the researchers measured the activity of dopamine neurons, which are responsible for the brain’s reward response. They found activity was higher in animals during the brief sleep loss period.
While researchers do not fully understand why sleep loss causes this effect in the brain, Kozorovitskiy suspects evolution is at play. “The anti-depressant effect is transient, and we know the importance of a good night's sleep,” she said.”

2,Commission tightens rules for hair transplant centres,"Introduces mandatory registration, licensing requirements","Punjab Healthcare Commission has introduced mandatory registration and licensing requirements for hair transplant centres, alongside a ban on using the term ""clinic"" with beauty salons.
The commission has also prohibited the use of unregistered products categorised as medicines in all hair transplant centres and beauty salons.
According to official sources, directives have been issued, urging immediate registration and licensing for all such establishments, with a one-month timeframe for compliance.
The registration process will be conducted online through the Punjab Healthcare Commission, which will issue the registration licenses. Qualified staff is now a prerequisite for operation in hair transplant centres, beauty salons, and beauty parlours, with strict criteria for degrees and certifications.
Degrees and diplomas approved and certified by the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council are mandatory, rejecting any private certificates, fake illegal degrees, or untrained staff.

These regulations apply to centres and salons performing invasive, minimally invasive, or non-invasive procedures. Non-compliance after March 15 will lead to crackdowns, sealing of establishments, and the registration of FIRs, resulting in arrests and fines.
Despite partial implementation after initial instructions and notices, it has been decided to fully enforce these laws. Unions and associations representing hair transplant centres and beauty salons have received notices, instructing them to ensure their members comply with the new regulations.
Caretaker Provincial Health Minister Dr Jamal Nasir emphasised that invasive procedures, cutting through the skin, can lead to adverse health effects and the spread of diseases.
The initiative aims at fostering a healthy Punjab, with experts warning of potential risks such as cancer, hepatitis, and skin diseases associated with these procedures. He said the commission's measures align with the broader goal of promoting public health and safety in the province.

3,SC breathes life into IWMB’s hope,CDA’s sealing of wildlife board offices in MHNP declared illegal by apex court,"The Supreme Court (SC) Thursday ordered the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to return all three offices of the Islamabad Wildlife Board (IWMB) to the wildlife protection agency, declaring the sealing of the facilities inappropriate.
The dispute between the civic body and the federal capital’s sole wildlife protection agency arose when CDA tried to forcibly seal IWMB’s Public Information Centres within the jurisdiction of the Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP) sans prior notice.
Following the brief tug-of-war, the IWMB moved the apex court, prompting a hearing by a three-member bench headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faiz Isa.
The court ordered CDA to return all three wildlife offices including those on Trail 5, and Trail 6.
Moreover, the court asked for all the details, including photographs, of the CDA Rest House in Daman-e-Koh. The court observed that the CDA Rest House established in Daman-e-Koh should be for public use instead of the CDA chairman and officers. The court sought complete details of all the lands acquired by the CDA in the national park area.

The court issued notices to the attorney general and advocate general regarding the dispute over a private restaurant on military grassland.
Declaring the seizure of office items by CDA, the court also ordered the agency to return the equipment collected from the offices of the wildlife board.
“There is a risk of fires in the national park. The wildlife board should re-install its equipment to deal with the threats,” ruled the court.
At the onset of the hearing, the court was told that CDA vacated the sites without any notice. The conduct exhibited by the CDA was inappropriate.
During the hearing, CDA's lawyer said that CDA should be allowed to share those buildings. The chief justice remarked that a thing has been invented and it is called a car. “When needed, you can drive from the CDA office to Margalla Hills,” Justice Isa observed.
Counsel for CDA said the civic body has a rest house in the national park. The court declared that the rest house of CDA should be used for public purposes. An order was given to provide photographs of the rest house. The court declared that the details of all the properties owned by CDA in Margalla Hills should also be provided.
CJP Qazi Faez Isa said Prophet Muhammad (may God bless him) has been called Rahmatulil Alameen (a blessing for all the universe). What does this mean? CDA counsel replied that it means he is a blessing to all the world.
The chief justice said that on the night of Miraj (ascension), all the prophets prayed behind the prophet Muhammed, why was this honour not given to any other prophet? It meant that after him, peace and blessings be upon him, we have to take guidance from the prophet. Allah gave the title Habibullah to our beloved prophet.
Justice Isa further said now come to our Constitution. What is written in the very beginning?
The CDA lawyer said it is written in the beginning of the Constitution that the sovereignty belongs to Allah. The chief justice said MHNP also falls under its ambit.
Later during the hearing, Umar Ejaz Gilani Advocate referred to a decision of CJP Qazi Faez Isa. He said we did not come here against CDA. We want the two organisations to work amicably together. We want none of the two blocks the other's way. The court adjourned further hearing till March 11.

Notably, the Pakistan Navy’s assistance will be sought for potential rescue operations in case of drowning incidents.
Furthermore, arrangements for free drinking water will be made, while heavy transport vehicles will be restricted from accessing the stretch of the Indus Highway between Jamshoro and Dadu, given the anticipated surge in public transport vehicles. 
Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) has been urged to minimise load shedding and ensure uninterrupted power supply during the event.
Official proceedings during the Urs celebrations will encompass various activities including sports events, cattle shows, exhibitions, conferences, and an award ceremony.
The significance of security measures was underscored by the tragic incident on February 16, 2017, when a suicide bomber detonated explosives inside the shrine, claiming over 90 lives, including women and children. Since then, the government has prioritised the shrine’s security, enhancing deployment, monitoring, and intelligence support to prevent such incidents.
