0,IMF looking forward to working with new govt,Spokesperson declines to comment on Imran’s letter to global lender,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said that it looks forward to working with the new government in Pakistan for ""macroeconomic stability and prosperity for Pakistanis"".
“We look forward to working with the new government on policies to ensure macroeconomic stability and prosperity for all of Pakistan’s citizens,"" Head of the Communications Department at the IMF Julie Kozack said in response to a question about whether Pakistan was on track to secure the third tranche of the Stand-By Agreement (SBA) reached in June 2023.
“On January 11, the IMF Executive Board approved the first review of the Stand-By Arrangement with Pakistan that brought total disbursements under the Stand-By Arrangement to $1.9 billion,” Julie added.
“The Stand-By Arrangement is supporting the authority’s efforts to stabilise the economy and to, of course, with a strong focus on protecting the most vulnerable.”
The IMF spokesperson also stated that the authorities maintained economic stability during the caretaker government’s tenure.
“This has been done through strict adherence to the fiscal targets while also protecting the social safety net. It has been done by maintaining a stern monetary policy stance to regulate inflation, and to continue to grow the foreign exchange reserves,” she added.

To a question about Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan’s possible letter to the IMF, the spokesperson said, “I’m not going to comment on ongoing political developments. So, I don’t have anything else to add to what I just said.”
In an unofficial conversation with media persons at the Adiala Jail, Imran revealed having written a letter to the IMF, asking it to make its next loan programme conditional to Pakistan conducting an audit of the Feb 8 general elections.
Imran stated that the letter raises concerns about obtaining loans in such circumstances, questioning who would be responsible for repaying the international monetary body in the current circumstances.
Notably, Pakistan and the IMF reached an SBA worth $3 billion in June 2023, following which $1.2 billion was immediately disbursed to avoid default.
Earlier, on Jan 11, the IMF executive board completed its first review of the country’s economic reform programme, which paved the way for Pakistan to get $700 million.
Following the IMF’s help, the total disbursements under the programme reached to $1.9 billion. It is expected that the IMF programme will conclude in the second week of April.

1,Sindh Assembly members to take oath today,Bilawal again picks Murad for Sindh CM’s slot,"Bringing an end to speculations, the PPP on Friday announced that it had again chosen Murad Ali Shah for the post of the Sindh chief minister while Governor Kamran Tessori convened a provincial assembly session on Saturday (today) during which the newly elected members will take oath.
Addressing the PPP Sindh parliamentary committee in Lahore, party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari further said Awais and Anthony would be their candidates for the positions of the provincial assembly speaker and his deputy, respectively.
“We will request him [Murad] to take the responsibility of this post again. However, this time around, we have to beat our own record,” he added, referring to the development work the former Sindh chief minister had carried out in the province since taking over the office in 2016 when his predecessor Qaim Ali Shah had stepped down.
He pointed out that the people of Sindh had not only made the PPP successful in the elections, but also given the party a better mandate than in the past.
He went on to acknowledge that with increased expectations from the people, the PPP was committed to addressing the pressing issues faced by the province.

The PPP chairman noted that that the 2022 floods not only devastated several homes in Sindh, but 50% of educational institutions in the province were swept away as well.
He pledged to rebuild those educational institutions in the province.
“We understand the hardships faced by our people, especially in the aftermath of the 2022 floods. We are determined to rebuild not only the homes but also the educational institutions that form the backbone of our society,"" Bilawal vowed.
Earlier, rumours had surfaced that apart from Murad, the other strong contenders for the Sindh’s coveted post of the chief minister were Faryal Talpur – sister of PPP Co-chairperson and former president Asif Ali Zardari; former provincial information minister Sharjeel Inam Memon; and ex-local government minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah.
However, sources said Faryal was not interested in the slot.
They added that the top PPP leadership was satisfied with Murad’s performance.
Murad replaced Qaim in July 2016 and remained one of the active chief ministers of Sindh.
He continued his second tenure after the general elections in 2018 till 2023, when the interim set-up took over for the polls.
In the recent elections, Murad secured victory from PS-77 Jamshoro-I against Roshan Ali of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA).
Awais emerged successful from PS-23, Sukkur–II defeating Inayatullah of the GDA.
Anthony bagged a reserved seat for minorities in the Sindh Assembly.
The announcement of key nominations marks a significant step in shaping the leadership of Sindh, and the newly appointed officials are expected to play a crucial role in addressing the challenges faced by the province.
The focus on rebuilding educational institutions underscores the party's commitment to restoring the foundations of learning and providing a brighter future for the people of Sindh.
Meanwhile, Governor Tessori convened a provincial assembly session on Feb 24 at the Sindh Assembly Building during which newly elected members will take oath.
The outgoing Sindh Assembly Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani will preside over the session and take oath from the elected MPAs.
After oath-taking of the newly elected members of the provincial legislature, schedule for election of the speaker and deputy speaker will be announced. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Peoples Party has already nominated Murad Ali Shah for the slot of the provincial chief minister.

2,Curtain raises on Punjab Assembly,"Punjab MPAs take oath; Maryam makes entry into parliamentary politics; slogans, uproar dominate maiden session","The newly elected representatives of the Punjab Assembly on Friday took the oath of office in their maiden session marred by uproar and protests.
Following a bumpy start, the reports of a PTI-backed lawmaker's arrest cast a shadow over the proceedings.
As the session kicked off, members of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) raised concerns about reserved seats in the house.
The party lawmakers argued that while seats for other parties had been announced, theirs remained pending, and demanded a halt to the oath-taking.
The ensuing chaos saw a verbal exchange and slogans echoing through the assembly. The PML-N members brandished placards featuring party supremo Nawaz Sharif's images, countering with chants of ""watch thieves"" from PTI-backed lawmakers.
The speaker had to adjourn the meeting for 45 minutes to restore order.
When the proceedings resumed, the speaker administered the oath to the members, but the absence of PTI's nominated chief minister, Mian Aslam Iqbal, caused a delay.
The speaker waited for the absent members before proceeding with the oath for the rest.
Security measures outside the assembly included prison vans and water cannons, anticipating possible arrests related to the May 9 incident.
The session, set to commence at 10am, faced a delay of more than two hours.
The proceedings gained momentum at around 2:30pm, as outgoing Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan administered the oath to the newly elected members, extending congratulations and best wishes.
PML-N’s candidate for the Punjab chief minister, Maryam Nawaz, former federal minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, and PTI leader Aamir Dogar were among the attendees.
It marked Maryam's first election as a lawmaker.
The outgoing speaker administered oaths to 215 PML-N and allied party lawmakers, along with 98 SIC and PTI-backed lawmakers.
Sibtain also issued the schedule for the election of the new speaker and deputy speaker of the Punjab Assembly.
The election schedule for the new speaker and deputy speaker is set to take place on Feb 24 (today) through a secret ballot.
Nomination papers’ submission and scrutiny were conducted until 5:30pm.
PML-N's Malik Mohammad Ahmed and SIC's Ahmed Khan Picher submitted their nomination papers for the post of speaker.
PML-N's Malik Zaheer Iqbal and Mohammad Moinuddin Riaz are contending for the deputy speaker’s slot.
Following scrutiny, their nomination papers were approved, as confirmed by Chaudhry Amir Habib, the secretary of the PA.
The session was called by Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman a day prior, following the partial notification from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) regarding reserved seats for women and minorities.
The Punjab Assembly, boasting 371 seats, consisting of 297 general seats and 74 reserved seats (66 for women and eight for minorities), holds the distinction of being the largest elected house in the country.
To date, the ECP has issued notifications for 42 reserved seats for women and five for minorities.
On Feb 8, elections on 296 general seats were conducted, with the polling for one seat delayed due to a candidate's unfortunate demise.
Worth noting is that the previous assembly was dissolved in Jan 2023, leaving the province without a legislature for over a year.
Following the oath administration on Wednesday, Speaker Sibtain urged lawmakers to maintain a positive atmosphere, encouraging them to listen to each other patiently.
Meanwhile, reports of Mian Aslam's arrest, a PTI-backed independent lawmaker nominated for the post of chief minister, stirred tension, leading the speaker to instruct the police to provide a status report on Aslam.
While the PML-N lawmakers pressed for the oath administration, opposition members sought an adjournment due to the yet-to-be-allocated reserve seats. The session was briefly adjourned until after Friday prayers.
Addressing the uneven playing field for some lawmakers, Speaker Sibtain pledged to address obstacles faced by the PTI-backed independents, vowing to ensure the representation of the people.
He said a level-playing field has been provided to some lawmakers while not to others, in reference to obstacles being faced by the PTI-backed independent candidates.
""Now that I have come to the assembly, I shall see who stops the representatives of the people from coming to the premises,"" Sibtain said on arrival at the assembly.
He added that he would seek information regarding those lawmakers who had been barred from entering the premises.
""Today in the assembly, there will be no other activity apart from administering oath to the nine designated lawmakers.""
The PML-N nominated Maryam Nawaz as its candidate for the chief ministership.
If elected, Maryam would become the first-ever woman chief minister in the country’s history.
Despite challenges to the election results by PTI-backed independents in several Punjab constituencies, the PML-N asserts it has garnered sufficient seats to establish the government.
To achieve this in Punjab, the party needs backing from 186 MPAs.
In the Feb 8 elections, the PML-N secured 137 seats. On Friday, it was assigned 36 reserved seats for women and five for minorities, raising its total strength in the 397-seat house to 178.
However, the party contends it enjoys support from over 190 MPAs.

3,PAs mark shift from ballots to governance,"Punjab Assembly convenes today, Sindh tomorrow","The country entered the government formation phase on Thursday, transitioning from the electoral period. Assembly sessions were called in Punjab and Sindh by their governors, and a summary was forwarded to the president to convene the National Assembly session next week.

The Punjab Assembly will convene on Friday (today), marking the first legislature session since the February 8 general elections. Subsequently, the Sindh Assembly session is scheduled for Saturday (tomorrow). During these inaugural sessions, the newly-elected members of the provincial assemblies (MPAs) will take their oath of office.

Punjab Governor Baleeghur Rehman and Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori summoned the provincial assembly sessions after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) allocated reserved seats for women and minorities to the respective parties based on their performance in the general seats.

While the ECP is yet to allocate reserved seats in the National Assembly, as well as the provincial legislatures of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the parliamentary affairs ministry forwarded a summary to President Arif Alvi, proposing the convening of the National Assembly between February 26-28.

The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) holds a clear majority in the Sindh Assembly, while the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) asserts a comfortable majority in Punjab, aiming to form its own government. Both parties have forged an alliance to collectively establish the government at the Centre.

Conversely, a significant number of independent candidates backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) secured victory in the February 8 elections. To ensure their representation in the reserved seats, they aligned with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).

In a notification issued on Thursday, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) did not allocate any seats to the SIC. However, sources reveal that the SIC had submitted an application for reserved seat allocation, citing its legislative presence. The ECP is expected to announce its decision on Friday (today).

The Punjab Assembly would hold its inaugural session on Friday (today), in which the newly-elected provincial lawmakers (MPAs) would take oath, according to a notification issued by Governor Balighur Rehman on Thursday.

In Lahore, the Punjab Assembly will convene at 10am, marking the first legislature session since the general elections. Speaker Sibtain Khan will preside over the session and administer the oath to the new MPAs.

Despite challenges to the election results by PTI-backed independents in several Punjab constituencies, the PML-N asserts it has garnered sufficient seats to establish the government. To achieve this in Punjab, the party would need backing from 186 MPAs.

In the February 8 elections, the PML-N secured 137 seats. On Friday, it was assigned 36 reserved seats for women and five for minorities, raising its total strength in the 397-seat house to 178. However, the party contends it enjoys support from over 190 MPAs.

The PML-N has nominated Maryam Nawaz as its candidate for the chief ministership. If the claim of the support of the 190 MPAs was true, then Maryam would easily become the first ever female chief minister in the country’s history.

Here, the PTI has 110 independents, but when it decided to join the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), 105 of the independents submitted affidavits with the ECP. The PPP secured 10 seats and got three reserved seats. The PML-Quaid got two reserved seats and the Istehkam-e-Pakistan (IPP) received one.

The PTI had nominated Mian Aslam Iqbal for the position of the chief minister. Earlier, the PTI had called a protest outside the assembly against alleged election rigging but in a late-night development, the party decided to attend the session, according some media reports.

In Sindh, Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani will chair the inaugural session. In the general elections, the PPP got 84 seats, followed by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) 28 and the PTI-backed 11 independents and 7 others.

Based on this party standing, according to an ECP notification, the PPP got 20 reserved seats for women and six seats reserved for minorities. The MQM got six women’s seats and two minorities seats. One reserved seat for women had been allocated to the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA).

Those notified as the MPAs on reserved seats for women in the Punjab Assembly are Zakia Khan, Ishrat Ashraf, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Azma Zahid Bokhari, Hina Parvez Butt, Salma Saadia Temur, Rahila Naeem, Bushra Anjum Butt, Sania Ashiq Jabeen, Salma Butt, Kanwal Pervez, Mehwish Sultana, Nausheen Adnan, Asma Ehtishamul Haq, Kausar Javed, Uzma Jabeen, Ambreen lsmail, Mumtaz Begum, Sunbal Malik Hussain, Rukhsana Kausar, Shazia Rizwan, Motiya Begum, Rabia Naseem Farooqi, Sonia Ashir, Uzma Kardar, Safia Saeed, Tahia Noon, Amina Hassan, Asma Naz, Tahira Mushtaq, Zaibunnisa Awan, Fatima Begum, Qudsia Batool, Riffat Abbasi, Atiya lftikhar, Rushda Lodhi, Shazia Abid, Neelam Jabbar, Nargis Faiz Malik, Tashfeen Safdar, Salma Saeed and Sarah Ahmad.

Similarly, the MPAs on the reserved seats for minorities in the Punjab Assembly are Falbous Christopher, Emmanuel Ather, Ramesh Singh Arora, Khalil Tahir and Shakeela Javed.

The winners on the women’s seats in Sindh Assembly are Seema Khurram, Tanzila Um-e-Habiba, Rehana Laghari, Yasmeen Shah, Nuhzat Pathan, Syeda Marvi Faseeh, Sadia Javed, Farzana Hanif, Sajeela, Hina Dastagir, Rukhsana Perveen, Heer Soho, Nida Khuhro, Saima Agha, Rooma Sabahat, Arooba Rabbani, Khairunisa, Maleeha Manzoor, Shazia Umar, Shaheena, Sofia Saeed Shah, Sikandar Khatoon, Kiran Masood, Farah Sohail, Quratul Ain Khan, Bilqees Mukhtar, and Fozia Kausar.
