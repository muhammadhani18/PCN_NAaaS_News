0,Sazgar-GWM launch ORA 3 EV in Pakistan,Partnership targets sustainable transportation solutions amid global oil price hikes,"Sazgar Engineering, one of Pakistan’s leading car manufacturers, has partnered with Chinese car manufacturer Great Wall Motors (GWM) to introduce their latest innovation in the automotive industry, the electric vehicle ORA 3. This collaboration aims to revolutionise the Pakistani market by offering sustainable and eco-friendly transportation solutions.
“With cars being the primary mode of transportation in Pakistan and gasoline prices continuously rising due to global oil price hikes, there’s a clear and urgent need for alternative energy solutions,” stated a representative from Sazgar Engineering. “New energy vehicles (NEVs) seem to be the perfect fit.” 
Sazgar Engineering has set the price of the ORA 3 at Rs8.99 million, making it an attractive option for consumers looking to embrace NEVs. The company has announced that bookings for this vehicle will open in the coming days, with an initial booking price of Rs5 million.
Pakistan is catching a ride on the global NEVs boom. Last year, global sales of NEVs reached approximately 14.61 million units, representing a 38% year-on-year growth. Among them, China accounted for 9.495 million units of NEV sales, capturing a 65% market share in the global market. A number of Chinese companies such as BAIC, Changan, JAC Motors, 
Great Wall Motors, MG, FAW, and Chery Automobile have established their presence and even formed joint ventures in Pakistan, driving the new energy vehicles industry in the country towards intelligence and electrification.
“As Sazgar takes the lead in embracing electric mobility in Pakistan, we are proud to set new standards and contribute to the collective effort in combating climate change,” continued the representative from Sazgar. “This partnership opens doors for technological advancements and knowledge sharing, enabling the local auto industry to embrace sustainability and cater to the growing demand for eco-friendly transportation.”

1,IT sector aims for $15 billion export boost,"Caretaker minister unveils roadmap, initiatives to drive innovation and economic growth","The caretaker IT minister states that they have laid out a roadmap to achieve a target of $15 billion in IT exports to bolster the country’s economy. Several key measures have been introduced by the caretaker government to reach this export target.
In an interview with The Express Tribune, Caretaker IT Minister Dr Umar Saif said, “Now, the roadmap is ready, and we hope that the upcoming government will continue these policies to achieve the export target.”
Key measures include introducing foreign currency retention accounts, establishing training programmes, and creating co-working spaces and a startup fund to foster innovation. Paypal has entered into a partnership with Payoneer in Pakistan to provide the facility of receiving funds for freelancers.
“A pilot project has been launched with 10,000 accounts, which will be fully launched in March,” said Saif, adding that Pakistani freelancers will be able to receive funds but will not have the facility to send funds under this initiative.
Among the key initiatives disclosed by the caretaker IT minister is the introduction of foreign currency retention accounts tailored specifically for IT enterprises. This move is expected to streamline financial operations for tech companies, thereby fostering an environment conducive to growth and investment.
“During the caretaker government, IT companies have been allowed to retain 50% of funds in their accounts for spending,” he said. “Due to the 50% retention facility, the country has seen a record boost in IT exports during November to December 2023 and January 2024,” said Saif.
If exports continue to rise at the current pace, the IT exports of Pakistan will cross $4 billion during the next 12 months.
The country has been facing a scarcity of qualified people in the IT sector, he said, adding that the caretaker government has launched a training programme for 200,000 graduates who are expected to bring $5 billion into Pakistan after enhancing their skills.
Additionally, the implementation of training programmes aimed at augmenting the IT workforce underscores Pakistan’s commitment to nurturing local talent and meeting the demands of a rapidly evolving industry.
“With the establishment of 10,000 e-Rozgar centres, the IT ministry hopes for an inflow of $10 billion into the country,” he said, adding that, “If one freelancer earns $30 daily, the government hopes one million freelancers will be capable of bringing $10 billion into the country.”
In a bid to cultivate innovation and entrepreneurship, the government is also rolling out co-working spaces and instituting a startup fund geared towards providing crucial capital for burgeoning ventures.
“We have started a startup fund to mitigate the risks of those startups that wanted to raise money. The government of Pakistan will provide a 30% grant to the startups, and this initiative will raise investment in the country,” explained the IT minister. He said that PC-1 of this scheme had been approved and the government will start receiving applications from March 15, 2024.
Furthermore, measures to allocate spectrum for 5G networks signify a concerted effort to enhance connectivity and technological infrastructure. Saif highlighted the national fiberisation policy and telecom tribunal as crucial steps in building a robust telecom framework.
“These moves aim to enhance domestic connectivity, attract foreign investment, and establish Pakistan as a digital hub,” he said.
“Internet traffic of China has been connected with Pakistan, which will work as a digital corridor to connect with landlocked Central Asian states, bringing $200 million to $400 million in revenue for Pakistan,” hoped the minister.
Additionally, the government’s proactive approach extends to satellite services, with a policy to entice providers like Starlink. Saif said that the government had taken measures to boost exports, attract investment, and strengthen technology by incentivising handset manufacturers and positioning Pakistan as a digital gateway.
“With these diverse initiatives, Pakistan is poised to seize digital age opportunities, driving sustainable economic growth and innovation,” he said.
The IT ministry has also taken an initiative to enhance exports of handsets. “We asked the commerce ministry to allow 3%-8% RD allowance for handset manufacturers to enhance exports,” said Saif, adding that, “We also wanted the approval of handset financing facility.”
He added that all initiatives taken by the caretaker government are expected to bring in $15-$20 billion into the IT sector.

2,Border challenges stall Pakistan-Afghanistan trade,Efforts to boost bilateral commerce hampered by operational and political barriers,"Peshawar serves as the gateway to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, facilitating the import and export of various products. The Torkham border acts as a pathway, enabling the expansion of trade between the two countries on a global scale.
Pakistan and Afghanistan share a border spanning over 2,600 kilometres. Following the implementation of border fencing, illegal movements of goods across the border have been curtailed to some extent.
There are 18 trading points along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, with key crossing points being Torkham and Chaman. Torkham, situated in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and Chaman, located in Balochistan, are connected to Afghanistan’s Jalalabad and Kandahar provinces respectively.
According to a survey conducted by the Pakistan-Afghanistan Joint Chamber of Commerce, trade between the two countries amounted to $2.5 billion in 2010. However, this figure dropped to $1.6 billion before experiencing a slight increase to over $1.8 billion in 2022-23.
Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan comprise various categories, including cereals (25%), sugar and sugar confectionery (4%), edible vegetables, roots, and tubers (7%), fruits, nuts, and peels of melons and citrus fruits (15%), salt, sulphur, earth-stones (13%), animal or vegetable fats and oils (7%), plastics and articles thereof (5%), pharmaceutical products (13%), wood and articles of wood, wood charcoal (6%), and iron and steel (5%).
Key potential imports from Afghanistan include figs, grapes, almonds, onions, cumin seeds, apples, beans, cotton, and, notably, rough gemstones.
In Peshawar, there are carpets, plastics, and other utensils labelled as Iranian products but manufactured in Pakistan. Additionally, goods such as oil, petrol, and others smuggled from Iran are sold at lower prices in Peshawar and surrounding areas.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Shah Jahan Khan, an exporter in Torkham, highlighted the challenges faced by traders operating between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Despite bilateral trade and Afghanistan importing more goods from Pakistan, frequent border closures result in significant financial losses for businesses in both countries.
Sharing his views with The Express Tribune, Jamsheed Khan emphasised the necessity for joint efforts by Pakistan and Afghanistan to address the difficulties faced by traders. He proposed improved border management and bilateral trade discussions involving top officials to enhance economic conditions in both nations.
Former President of the Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Zahid Shinwari expressed concerns to The Express Tribune about the decline in Pakistan-Afghanistan trade from $1.5 billion to $5 million. He noted competition from Iran and China, urging authorities to find solutions beneficial to traders in both countries.
He suggested that if the USA and Europe, as well as Iran, Saudi Arabia, India, and Nepal, can engage in trade, there’s no reason why Pakistan and Afghanistan cannot do the same.
President of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Fawad Ishaq, urged the governments to ease trade conditions for merchants, highlighting the cultural and religious similarities between the two nations.

He mentioned an agreement among China, Pakistan, and the Afghan Taliban administration to extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan. However, little progress has been made thus far, highlighting the urgent need to accelerate work on the project.
“In our bazaars and shops, Chinese and Iranian products are readily available,” he remarked, pointing to Karhano market where both legally and illegally acquired goods from these countries are sold.
He added that recent operations in the border areas of Iran would also impact Pak-Iran trade, underscoring the need for Pakistan to improve trade relations with both Iran and Afghanistan. He called for collaborative efforts to resolve issues arising from the Torkham border closure, which were causing significant economic losses.
Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, Pakistan-Afghanistan Joint Coordinator for Trade, mentioned the decline in bilateral trade to $80-90 million from the previous $2.5 billion. He highlighted the impact of changing governments in both countries on trade dynamics and suggested addressing issues through mutual dialogue.
He added that before the political changes, the situation was favourable, but since the merger of tribal districts and the implementation of a policing system, truck drivers at the Torkham border have been demanding bribes at checkpoints, leading to dissatisfaction among them.
He noted that the Torkham border had been closed for over ten days, resulting in significant revenue losses, over Rs88 billion, for the governments of both Pakistan and Afghanistan.
He proposed a streamlined visa process for border drivers, suggesting that both the Pakistani and Afghan governments issue red passes to facilitate easier movement. He explained that it was a costly and time-consuming exercise to apply for a visa every time a driver has to make a trip to either country. He cited the Geneva Convention, highlighting the need to provide facilities to Afghans at sea ports and advocating for similar treatment at the Torkham border.
“Most of the market is dominated by Chinese and Iranian products,” Sarhadi remarked, cautioning that if this trend continues, Pakistan may lose Afghanistan as a trading partner.
He underscored the importance of collaborative efforts between Pakistan and Afghanistan, especially in light of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the incoming government in Pakistan, to improve border management and bilateral trade.
All stakeholders in conversation with The Express Tribune stressed the importance of cooperative measures, efficient border management, and a conducive trading environment to revitalise the Pakistan-Afghanistan trade relationship and mitigate financial losses.

3,Bulls keep control as stocks extend rally,"KSE-100 index gains 355.19 points, settles at 61,914.34","The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its recovery on Thursday as the KSE-100 index extended its rally and closed near the 62,000-mark, buoyed by optimism about the settlement of political parties for a coalition power-sharing deal.
As trading commenced, the index maintained its momentum from the previous day, experiencing fluctuations but steadily rising throughout the session.
The decision on power-sharing arrangements to form a new government instilled hope and bolstered investor confidence, resulting in a positive sentiment for the day.
The strong performance of dollar bonds, coupled with rupee stability, contributed to the index’s advancement.
Although the KSE-100 index briefly dipped before the final hours, growing investor confidence propelled it to climb rapidly, reaching an intra-day high at 61,952.09 points just before the close.
The market closed in the green, nearing the 62,000-point mark.
“Stocks closed higher after the government slashed NSC rates and a coalition power-sharing deal was reached, leading to political stability,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Dollar bonds’ outperformance, strong earnings outlook, and rupee stability played a catalyst role in the bullish close.” At the close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a significant gain of 355.19 points, or 0.58%, settling at 61,914.34.
Topline Securities noted that it was ‘a positive day.’ Continuing its recovery mood from Wednesday, Pakistan equities initiated the business on a positive note, remained bullish almost throughout the session, it said.
“The aforementioned buying momentum can be attributed to consensus regarding the formation of a new government, where major political parties agreed and informed about the upcoming coalition setup.” Due to the development, across-the-board buying momentum has been seen throughout the trading hours, it added.
Resultantly, the tech, bank and fertiliser sectors contributed positively to the index as Systems Limited, Meezan Bank, TRG Pakistan, Engro Fertilisers, and United Bank added 367 points, cumulatively, Topline added.

Arif Habib Limited (AHL) observed in its report that “Further gains have now pushed the KSE-100 into the first hurdle level at 62,000 which needs to be crossed to indicate additional gains towards 64,000.”
Major investor participation was in the three-month T-bill most likely driven by expectations of a possible delay in the interest rate cut cycle, it said.
“From the government’s perspective, the reason for declining bids at higher rates for longer tenors could be the anticipation of a reversal in the interest rate cycle in the coming months. The government may aim to secure liquidity in longer-term instruments once rates are revised downward,” the AHL report added.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal noted that the market continued with the positive momentum.
“We recommend investors avail any downside as an opportunity to buy in the banking and E&P sectors,” the JS analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 324.8 million shares against Tuesday’s tally of 362.7 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs13.9 billion.
Shares of 352 companies were traded, with 185 stocks closing higher, 143 dropping, and 24 remaining unchanged.
Pak Elektron led in volume with trading in 23.11 million shares, losing Rs0.25 to close at Rs22.74. It was followed by Cnergyico PK with 21.2 million shares, losing Rs0.07 to close at Rs3.95, and Pakistan International Bulk Terminal with 16.25 million shares, gaining Rs0.51 to close at Rs6.22.

4,Rupee gains on optimism for IMF loan tranche,Forex reserves drop by $44m to $8.01b on debt repayment,"The Pakistani currency maintained an uptrend for the second successive working day, closing at Rs279.33 against the US dollar in the interbank market on optimism over receiving the International Monetary Fund’s next loan tranche of $1.1 billion in the near future.
According to SBP data, the domestic currency bounced back by 0.06% or Rs0.17 against the greenback on a day-to-day basis on Thursday.
Clarity on the political front has instilled confidence to the market that an IMF team will soon come to conduct the second review of the domestic economy under the loan programme of $3 billion in place.

Read Rupee rises amid political stability
To recall, the IMF had linked the last economic review with the formation of a new government in the centre. The development also helped the currency recover in the open market by 0.10%, or Rs0.28, to close at Rs282.16/$, ending the nine-day long losing streak in the retail market. Accordingly, the disparity in the value of the rupee between the two markets trimmed to 1.01% or Rs2.83.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves (held by SBP), however, dropped by $44 million to $8.01 billion in the week ended February 16 on foreign debt repayments, according to SBP.
The reserves provide import cover for less than two months, as debt repayments are not allowing them to stabilise and improve despite the foreign currency inflows from export earnings and stable to positive inflow of workers’ remittances.

5,PBF calls for political finance minister,"Says technocrat would struggle with IMF, conflict of interest and inflation crises","The Pakistan Business Forum (PBF) has said that entrusting a technocrat with the role of finance minister would pose significant challenges for the country amid the current economic climate.
“Any technocrat may struggle to negotiate a deal that balances economic stabilisation with the growing hardships faced by the people, potentially raising concerns about conflicts of interest,” said Khawaja Mahboobur Rehman, President of the PBF.
“PBF views Ishaq Dar as someone who has earned a reputation as a ‘tough negotiator’ with the IMF and remains a viable option,” said Rehman during a media interaction on Thursday.
He urged the prime minister (in-waiting) to appoint a politician as the finance minister to better grasp the local dynamics.
Rehman strongly demanded that the incoming government re-evaluate the policy of continually raising energy prices immediately. In particular, the decision to increase the captive gas price to Rs2,750/MMBtu, marking a 223% increase since January 2023, which Rehman insists poses a grave threat to Pakistan’s industrial sectors, with a complete collapse looming.
He highlighted that the escalating energy costs directly translate into higher production expenses across all industrial sectors, compelling businesses to transfer these costs to consumers. This, in turn, exacerbates the financial burden on consumers who have been grappling with relentless inflation for the past two years.

Read PBF urges use of AI for agricultural growth
Rehman stressed that dwindling consumer demand would further reduce manufacturing activities, perpetuating the cycle of economic strain. Additionally, the resulting inflation precludes any possibility of interest rate reductions in the foreseeable future, further stifling private sector growth.
Rehman urged the government to comprehensively reassess its energy pricing framework, noting that electricity prices for industrial consumers are significantly higher than those in regional economies like Bangladesh and India. With yet another hike in gas prices, manufacturing has become financially unviable in Pakistan, deterring both domestic and foreign investment.
He proposed the immediate removal of cross-subsidies from power tariffs for industrial consumers to align them with regionally competitive levels of 9 cents/kWh, which would incentivise a shift away from gas-based captive generation, stimulate industrial activity, and facilitate job creation and income generation.
The PBF president added that this measure would enhance Pakistan’s competitiveness globally, positioning it as an attractive destination for investment and manufacturing.
The PBF stands ready to engage in collaborative dialogue with the government and stakeholders to formulate a balanced, forward-looking energy policy that addresses immediate economic challenges and fosters a resilient, competitive, and sustainable industrial sector in Pakistan, said the PBF president.

7,Austerity measures reintroduced,"PM bans creating new positions, making any major purchases amid economic strain","Interim Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar has approved new fiscal austerity measures, including a ban on creating new positions and major purchases. However, the impact of these measures may be limited, as the government spends more than its total net income just on interest payments.
A complete ban on creating new posts under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) and the current budget for the fiscal year 2023-24 has been approved by the government.
The caretaker PM approved the austerity measures almost four months before the end of the current fiscal year 2023-24, which is ending in June. Usually, the policy is approved at the start of the fiscal year, but the interim government approved it a week before the end of its term in office.
Additionally, the prime minister has banned the purchase of machinery and equipment from the current budget, except for medical purposes, according to the notification.
However, certain development projects have been initiated in the name of capacity building but are used for meeting the personal needs of bureaucrats and politicians, according to sources. Funds allocated for these projects have been misused for buying food, furniture and other personal items for bureaucrats.
Moreover, the PM has banned the purchase of all vehicles except for ambulances, buses for educational institutions, solid waste vehicles, tractors, fire-fighting vehicles, and motorbikes, according to the decision.
Some caretaker cabinet ministers are reportedly using luxury vehicles above their entitlement of 1,800 cc cars, according to sources. They added that one such vehicle was provided by the Customs Department, and millions of rupees were spent by a collectorate of Customs.
For the current fiscal year, the National Assembly had approved a Rs14.4 trillion budget and a budget deficit of Rs7.5 trillion. However, this week, the finance ministry upwardly revised the budget deficit target to Rs8.5 trillion, primarily because of an increase in estimates of interest payments. As a result, the size of the budget would grow to Rs15.5 trillion.
Interest expenses have now been estimated at Rs8.333 trillion, compared to the annual allocation of Rs7.3 trillion.
During the first half of this fiscal year, the government spent Rs4.219 trillion on interest payments, a sum that was Rs219 billion more than the federal government’s net income during this period.
Past austerity policies have not helped achieve fiscal consolidation, often being relaxed after their approval.
While approving the new austerity policy, the PM also constituted an Austerity Committee to relax these measures.
The austerity committee will ensure implementation of the measures while being empowered to relax the policy, as per a notification issued by the Ministry of Finance.

The finance minister will chair the Austerity Committee, with members including the secretaries of finance, planning, and interior, along with the special secretary of the Cabinet and an additional secretary of finance.
This month, PM Kakar approved three-month salaries as a reward for his staff serving in the office and house. Subsequently, the PM decided to restrict the benefits to grades 1 to 16. However, sources suggest that there was pressure on the PM to restore the reward for officers serving in the internal wing of the Prime Minister House.
Pakistan is facing serious fiscal challenges, and cosmetic austerity measures may not be able to address the issue. The country cannot emerge from the fiscal crisis until it restructures public debt and reduces interest rates. Tax reforms are also necessary, as efforts to restructure the FBR ended up in court due to mishandling.
Cabinet ministers have questioned the impact of the restructuring exercise on Pakistan’s low tax-to-GDP ratio. The Ministry of Finance has stated that the government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit by expanding the tax net, rationalising subsidies, and promoting economic growth. However, rising debt servicing costs pose a significant challenge.
The ministry, on Thursday, also defended the caretaker government’s borrowing during the past seven months, stating that it focused on fiscal consolidation measures, including revenue mobilisation and expenditure rationalisation.
The finance ministry stated that the interim government shifted its domestic borrowing to long-term debt securities to finance the fiscal deficit. However, this move occurred at a time when interest rates were at historic highs in Pakistan, highlighting inadequate debt management, as noted by independent analysts.
The ministry further indicated that significant borrowing continued from floating-rate securities among medium to long-term instruments, while fixed-rate instruments were borrowed at an average of 3% to 4% below the policy rate during the interim government’s tenure.
The average time to maturity of domestic debt has increased to around three years by the end of January 2024, in line with targets mentioned in the Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) FY23-FY26.
The share of external debt in total public debt reduced from 38.3% at end-June 2023 to 36.7% at end-December 2023.
No expensive external borrowing was raised from commercial banks and international capital markets during the caretaker government, according to the finance ministry.
