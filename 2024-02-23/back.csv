1,IHC rejects Fawad's speedy bail plea,"Turning down request, Justice Farooq notes , Muhammad Bashir, was ill, appoints new judge","The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has turned down a request seeking directions for a trial court to expeditiously decide a bail application submitted by former minister Fawad Chaudhry.

IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq heard the application that stated that Islamabad Accountability Court-I judge was not hearing the bail application submitted by Chaudhry who is currently detained in connection with a corruption case.

The application requested the court to order the accountability court to hear the bail plea urgently.

Turning down the request, Justice Farooq noted that the accountability court judge, Muhammad Bashir, was ill and that a new judge, Nasir Javed Rana, has recently replaced him.

When Chaudhry’s lawyer requested the court to direct the newly appointed judge to address the application, the IHC chief justice noted that this would not be appropriate as Rana is a senior jurist.

“Wait till the next hearing of the case, If the trial court does not address the application, then we will issue directions,” he noted.

2,"Imran writes to IMF, urges poll audit before loan","Asks if country a loan in such a situation, then who will return it?","Stirring the political pot on the contentious Feb 8 general elections, PTI founder Imran Khan on Friday confirmed that he had penned a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), urging the global lender to give the poll results a thorough once-over before cutting any new cheques for Islamabad.
Speaking to the media after attending a hearing on the £190 million reference at the Adiala Jail, Imran raised alarms about the potential consequences of obtaining a loan under the current circumstances.
""If the country gets a loan in such a situation, then who will return it?"" he questioned, expressing concerns that such a loan could lead to increase in poverty.
The former prime minister warned that without substantial investment in the country, the burden of loans would continue to rise, underscoring the need for political stability.
He alleged that the institutions were compromised to ensure the selection of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, causing harm to various organisations, including the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).
Accusing the election process of being rigged in favour of Nawaz, Imran claimed that he had been unfairly subjected to allegations.
He pointed to the Rawalpindi commissioner, who had initially revealed poll rigging but later retracted, alleging that the former official was ""picked up and tortured"".
Imran added, ""A Vigo came and picked him up. Now his software has been updated.""
Imran’s announcement about the letter follows a statement by PTI Senator Ali Zafar the previous day, revealing the party founder's decision to write to the IMF, urging an audit of the Feb 8 elections before proceeding with talks for a new loan programme with Islamabad.
Despite Imran's efforts, it remains uncertain whether the letter will yield the desired results, as the IMF, on Friday, expressed willingness to work with the new Pakistani government while ignoring his demand.
Read Gohar warns of IMF programme risk sans Form-45-verified poll results
Earlier in the day, shortly before Imran’s statement, Zafar clarified that the country should continue to engage with the IMF.
Senator Zafar said that the engagement with the IMF should continue to ""ensure financial discipline, good governance, and economic stability which is critical for the prosperity of the people of Pakistan"".
He said that Pakistan will always remained a top priority for the party.
Zafar stated that the PTI will endorse all the initiatives aligning with the ""benefit of the country and national interest"".
Further, the party leader maintained that the PTI remained steadfast in its ""struggle for democracy"" and ""will continue to raise its voice at all forums and expect the international community’s support"".
Zafar, speaking to the media outside the Adiala jail later in the day, said the PTI founder maintained that the IMF programme should continue for the country.
He quoted Imran as saying that the party supremo said that the need was to better the economy.
""The PTI founder has said that there is a need for political and economic stability and we will raise our voice for democracy on every forum possible,"" Zafar said quoting Imran.
‘National security jeopardised’
However, the party has faced backlash over the letter’s timing as the country is embroiled in a severe economic crisis, and the upcoming government is already eying a new IMF programme.
Experts believed that writing such a letter was a terrible idea as it would not have any value but would lead to burning political capital and creating more rifts between the PTI and the powerful stakeholders.
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader Ishaq Dar alleged that Imran had jeopardised national security by penning a letter to the IMF for personal gain.
The former finance minister dismissed the importance of the letter, stating that it carried no weight.
He said that if the PTI founder had penned anything contrary to the national interest of the country, it was worthy of condemnation.
In his media statement outside the Punjab Assembly, Dar expressed his views, asserting that crafting content for personal gain was disgraceful and that the letter from the PTI founder held no significance.
Meanwhile, in defence of the decision, PTI leader Barrister Gohar Khan stated that letters to the IMF were not unprecedented, having been sent before and will be written again today.
He clarified that the current letter would not pose any threat to the country's economy, security, or democracy.
Addressing the media outside the Adiala Jail, Gohar added that he had a meeting with Imran in jail. The hearing for Al-Qadir Trust case took place, with the charge frame set for Feb 27.
He criticised the court proceedings, alleging that the trial was illegal and unconstitutional. Barrister Gohar also claimed that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the incumbent caretaker set-up failed in conducting fair elections.
Expressing dissatisfaction with the media's restricted access to the court proceedings, he emphasised that the PTI's stance was against the alleged incorrectness of Form-47, insisting that Form-45 was accurate.
Further, he asserted that the PTI, as a parliamentary participant, has actively contributed to the improvement of the country's economy, legal system, and democracy.

3,Grandchildren decry Bhutto's unjust trial,"Fatima Bhutto, ZAB Junior submit statement in SC"," 
Two grandchildren of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (ZAB) have contended that the trial in their grandfather’s case was a grave miscarriage of justice and in violation of basic constitutional guarantees of a citizen to “be dealt in accordance with the law”.

Fatima Bhutto and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Junior—children of Bhutto’s elder son Murtaza Bhutto—have said that in a written statement submitted to the Supreme Court through their counsel Zahid F Ebrahim.

A nine-member SC bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa is hearing a presidential reference seeking revisiting of the ZAB case.

The Lahore High Court (LHC) sentenced the former prime minister to death on March 18, 1978 for ordering assassination of Ahmed Reza Kasuri. The Supreme Court upheld the LHC verdict with a majority vote of 4 to 3 on February 6, 1979. The PPP founder was executed on April 4 of the same year.

Referring to the LHC verdict, the statement referred to the “unchallenged revelations” made by former CJ Justice Nasim Hasan Shah—who was among the judges who voted in favor of the LHC order—who admitted that the LHC chief justice then had a personal enmity against ZAB.

“It is plainly evident that the decision of the LHC was led by a chief justice whose hatred for Mr Bhutto was recognized by no less than Dr Justice Nasim Hasan Shah himself and the Supreme Court Judgment in the Bhutto Trial was a grave miscarriage of justice and thus in violation of basic Constitutional guarantees of a citizen to be dealt in accordance with the law.”

The statement also stated that there is now no doubt that an elected prime minister of Pakistan was overthrown in a military coup and a farcical judicial trial was orchestrated for no other reason but to murder Bhutto and to perpetuate a dictatorship.

“After all, how else can one read the speech of 5.7.77 of General Ziaul Haq who pledged that ‘I was obliged to step in to fill in the vacuum created by political leaders. I have accepted this challenge as a true soldier of Islam. My sole aim is to organize free and fair elections which will be held in October this year. Soon after the polls, power will be transferred to the elected representatives of the people’”.

The statement said it is never too late to right a wrong. In fact, it said, we will always be a prisoner to our crimes if we do not correct what we now know as plain miscarriage of justice.

“Therefore, it is humbly prayed that the Presidential Reference on the question as to whether the decision of the LHC as well as the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the murder trial against Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto meets the requirements of fundamental rights as guaranteed under Article 4, sub Articles (1) & (2)(a), Article 8, Article 9, Article 10A due process, Article 14, Article 25 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 must be answered in the negative.”

It said Ahmed Reza Kasuri was a founder member of the PPP and was elected as an MNA on a PPP ticket in 1970. He, however, soon developed differences with Bhutto and joined the Tehreek-e-Istiqlal party.

“On 11.11.1974, Mr Ahmed Reza Kasuri lodged FIR No. 402/1974 within hours of the murderous attack which led to the unfortunate death of his father late Nawab Ahmed Khan.

“In the FIR, he expressed his suspicion that because he had remained the most virulent critic of the person and policies of ZAB the attack had been made on him due to political reasons.

“Yet, in less than two years of lodging the FIR, in April 1976, Mr Ahmed Reza Kasuri rejoined the PPP.

“He continued to remain a member of and attended the meetings of Tehrik-i-Fikr-i-Quaid-e-Awam, an organization meant for propagating the political philosophy of Bhutto until April 1977. Mr Ahmed Reza Kasuri even applied for the PPP ticket to contest the general elections of 1977 but was denied.

 “The same Mr Ahmed Reza Kasuri who waxed eloquence on the person of Bhutto until a few months earlier, became the lead prosecution witness against Mr Bhutto as soon as General Ziaul Haq proclaimed Martial Law on 5.7.1977 and trial was entrusted in the hands of [LHC] Chief Justice Mushtaq Hussain.”

The statement said Article 189 establishes that any decision of the SC achieves finality.

However, the reference under Article 186, requires the SC to render an opinion after analyzing and evaluating the apex court’s and the LHC judgments in the ZAB case on the touchstone of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.

“The answering of questions in this reference will not affect the decision or the ratio decided in these judgments, but a plenary opinion thereon is a debt to our constitutional history which must be repaid”

Former attorney general for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan who is an amicus in this case said in view of the jurisdiction conferred on the SC under Article 186, the conviction and sentence passed against Bhutto may not be quashed, annulled or set aside.

The Supreme Court, however, may address the question of law and give opinion that in the light of the facts and prevailing circumstances and the personal enmity of the military dictator, the trial, conviction and sentence of Bhutto does not meet the constitutional requirements and due process of law.

He said the issue of wrongful convictions and miscarriage of justice has been addressed in many countries through enactment of specific legislation.

“In accordance with statutory provisions, convictions have been posthumously annulled, set aside and declarations of innocence, exonerations or pardons made in various jurisdictions,” he said.

4,Senate interior panel advances crucial bills,Approves amendment in Pakistan Penal Code,"Senate Standing Committee on Interior on Thursday unanimously passed a bill to amend the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 [The Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024].
During the session, significant bills were discussed, reflecting the committee's commitment to legislative excellence and public welfare.
Firstly, the committee unanimously passed the Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, with a notable emphasis on safeguarding the dignity of the deceased.
The bill also proposed an increase in fines to Rs500,000, signaling a stern stance against violations of human rights in the country. This unanimous decision underscores the committee’s dedication to upholding the sanctity of the law.
In a subsequent development, Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri withdrew the Prevention and Control of Human Trafficking (Amendment) Bill, 2024. This decision came as the relevant Ordinance, which the amendment sought to address, had already been repealed in 2018.
Another significant legislative action was the passage of Senator Shahadat Awan's Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024. This bill introduced crucial amendments to sections 292, 293, and 294 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), along with subsequent amendments in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Despite concerns raised about potential misuse of proposed sentence enhancements, the bill was passed with necessary amendments, highlighting the committee's diligence in refining legislative proposals for optimal effectiveness.
However, the committee deferred deliberations on the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which Senator Shahadat Awan had introduced. This bill focused on Sections 513 and 514 of the CrPC, indicating the committee's judicious approach to prioritizing legislative matters based on their urgency and significance.Additionally, the National Database and Registration Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2023, introduced by Senator Fawzia Arshad, underwent thorough scrutiny. The committee passed this bill with amendments, showcasing its commitment to enhancing administrative procedures and ensuring the efficacy of regulatory frameworks.
Beyond legislative matters, the committee addressed pressing issues raised by Senator Danesh Kumar. Concerns about commuter difficulties at check posts along the Balochistan-Karachi route and the demolition of a Hindu Temple in Mithi District, Tharparkar, were thoroughly discussed.
The committee recommended the establishment of a joint check post to streamline security procedures and ensure a seamless experience for commuters. Furthermore, it advocated for fair treatment of encroachers, stressing equitable enforcement of the law irrespective of social or religious affiliations.
The Senate Standing Committee on Interior operates with a sense of duty and responsibility towards the nation.
Senators Saifullah Abro, Danesh Kumar, Fawzia Arshad, Kamil Ali Agha, Shahadat Awan, Waqar Mehdi, and Aon Abbas, along with senior officials from relevant departments, collectively work towards legislative excellence and public welfare. Through their deliberations and decisions, they uphold the principles of justice, accountability, and progress for all citizens.

5,WFP seeks long-term climate resilience in Pakistan,Country Director Ushiyama says it is time to invest in enhancing resilience ahead of future shocks," 
The World Food Programme (WFP) said on Wednesday it was focused on fostering long-term resilience against climate change, strengthening food systems, and providing vital support to Pakistani government programmes aimed at rebuilding affected communities for a more sustainable future.
WFP Pakistan Country Director Coco Ushiyama said in a statement that now was the time to enhance resilience ahead of future shocks, adding that the WFP looked forward to enhanced partnerships towards the collective future of food security and nutrition for all.
“Flood-affected communities were provided with vital lifesaving and sustaining cash and food assistance with the support of humanitarian actors and donors like the EU,” Ushiyama said. “Now is the time to invest in enhancing resilience ahead of future shocks.”
More than 1,700 people lost their lives in the 2022 floods, which affected over 33 million people nationwide. Sindh, at heart of the Indus River basin, was the worst-affected province, accounting for nearly 70% of total losses and damage.
To support the government’s relief and recovery efforts after the floods, WFP leveraged its expertise in logistics, food and cash assistance, and resilience-building to respond to the immediate needs and to support recovery and rehabilitation of flood-affected people.
During the flood response period, which ended in December, the WFP supported those hit the hardest by the floods. Besides, many households not only used the cash for their immediate needs, but also to rebuild their businesses and other livelihoods that were interrupted or destroyed by the deluge.
The statement said that the WFP supported more than 180,000 flood-affected people in seven districts of Sindh in 2023 through its multipurpose cash interventions funded from the €3 million contribution provided by the European Union’s Humanitarian Aid Operations department.
EU Humanitarian Aid head in Pakistan Tahini Thammannagoda said that assistance enabled the flood-affected families to secure food, healthcare, education, and shelter in Jamshoro, Matiari, Mirpurkhas, Nousheroferoz, Sanghar, Shaheed Benazirabad, and Umerkot districts.
“Over one and half years later, many people still struggle to cope with the losses caused by the devastating 2022 floods. Together with partners like WFP, the EU supported the most vulnerable people with emergency assistance at a critical time,” Thammannagoda added in the statement.

6,Cabinet body okays IP project’s 1st phase,Gas pipeline will be laid from Iranian border to Gwadar,"The Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCoE) on Friday gave the nod to complete the first phase of the 80-kilometre Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project within the country’s territory.

According to sources, the pipeline would be laid from the Iranian border to Gwadar and take a year to complete.
It has been estimated that the first phase of the project would cost $158 million.

Government sources said the funds for the project would be provided from the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC).

A statement issued by the energy ministry’s petroleum division read that the CCoE approved the recommendations of the Ministerial Oversight Committee for the IP project formed by the interim premier in September last year.

The project will be executed by the Interstate Gas Systems (Pvt) Ltd.

The statement continued that all the concerned divisions gave positive approval to go ahead with the project to ensure the supply of gas to the people of Pakistan for meeting the growing energy needs of the country.

“This will not only increase Pakistan's energy security but also boost the confidence of local industries, which will be ensured with better supply of gas,” it added.

“This [project] will increase financial activities in the province of Balochistan that will help in the economic development of Pakistan,” the statement concluded.

In reality, the country has approved the project to avoid a looming $18 billion penalty.

According to reports, Iran had granted an extension in the deadline of the IP gas pipeline project by 180 days until September 2024. Tehran had granted this extension in a bid to avoid litigation in an international court.

Pakistan has decided to proceed with the construction of the IP gas pipeline within its borders to satisfy Tehran, despite the sanctions imposed by the US.

Iran claims to have already spent $2 billion to complete its part of the pipeline within its territory. In contrast, Pakistan has not even commenced construction.

Previously, constructing the 80- kilometre portion of the IP pipeline project was part of the LNG Gwadar Pipeline project, intended to connect the port with other parts of the country.

It was agreed that Pakistan could construct this portion if relations between Tehran and Washington normalised and Islamabad was granted a waiver.

However, because of the mounting pressure from Iran, Pakistan has now opted to build the portion of the IP gas pipeline project within its territory.

7,Several PTI leaders turned away from Adiala Jail,Leaders prevented from consulting PTI founder on ‘unfolding political developments’,"Several leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, including those elected in the February 8 general elections, were turned away by the Adiala Jail as they reached there for a meeting with the party founder Imran Khan, on Thursday.
These leaders said that they had a court order for the meeting with Imran to discuss the prevailing situation and unfolding political developments in the country, but the jail administration declined to obey the court orders.
The jail authorities allowed only five PTI leaders to meet with Imran—Barrister Ali Zafar, Barrister Umair Niazi, Ali Bukhari, Shadab Jafari, and Ahmed Owais Advocate, while the others were denied permission for the meeting.
Those who were not allowed to meet Imran, included Acting PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan, Chief Organiser Omar Ayub, former speaker Asad Qaiser, former Azad Kashmir prime minister Sardar Qayyum Niazi, besides Atif Khan, Shahram Tarakai, Sher Afzal Marwat, and Seembia Tahir.
Speaking to the media outside the jail, Asad Qaiser, former speaker of the National Assembly, said that despite the Islamabad High Court (IHC) orders, the jail administration did not allow them to meet with the party founder.
“Major developments are taking place in the country. Therefore, it is necessary for the senior leadership of the party to consult the PTI founder. The people have given a big mandate to the PTI founder,” Qaiser told reporters.
“Governments are being formed at the Centre and in Punjab. What will be the credibility of these governments that insult the opinions of the people. We want the rule of law and the Constitution in the country,” the former speaker added. He also said he would meet the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).
Ayub, who was not allowed to meet the PTI founder, told the media that he had brought the court order for the meeting, but the jail administration refused to obey it. “Imran Khan has nominated me for the premiership, should we go to the international court to meet with our leader?” he added.
The PTI acting secretary general said that meeting with their party founder was their legal right, which was being denied to them. He asked what Punjab Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi, inspector general (IG) of Punjab police, and the IG Jails were afraid of.
On the occasion, PTI leader Barrister Umair Niazi said that the political atmosphere was being vitiated by not allowing their meeting with Imran. To a question, he said that the Punjab Assembly session was being called in haste, adding that a government with stolen mandate would not be acceptable.
