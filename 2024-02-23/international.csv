0,Intermediate Board suffers at the hands of new parent body,"Ever since the Board has come under the control of Commissioner Karachi, its affairs have seemingly gone downhill","The outgoing provincial caretaker government’s move to hand over control of the Board of Intermediate Education Karachi to the Commissioner Karachi is slowly turning into a nightmare, much to the detriment of students. 
Previously, exam and registration fees were abolished for students attending government schools in Sindh to ensure free and compulsory education. However, ever since the Intermediate Board has come under the control of the Karachi Commissioner’s Office, students that were exempt now have to pay fees, under the guise of late charges. 
In this regard, the Board issued a notification towards the end of last month, as per which enrollment forms for 1st Year Intermediate Annual examinations for the current year would be entertained with a Rs 1,000 penalty. It is pertinent to mention that penalty fees or late charges are only incurred when a student has failed to submit the requisite forms according to the given timeline. However, as per various principals of government colleges and government higher secondary schools in Karachi, the Board has mandated them to collect penalty fees or late charges starting February 1st. 
A college principal, who spoke to The Express Tribune under the condition of anonymity, stated that this was the first time in over 8 years that the Board had mandated that government colleges charge their students Rs 1,000 in late fees. “Previously, every year the Board would give a date for submission of enrollments at least 3 times but this time around we have instructed to charge students a penalty fee,” he informed. 
Another principal, confirming the directives, said that previously the Board did not operate in such a manner.

In light of these revelations, The Express Tribune spoke to the Board’s acting Secretary, Haroon Rasheed. “The enrollment forms date has already been announced 3 times. Students who do not submit the forms on time are charged the late fees,” he clarified. When asked as to why new candidates were being charged the late fees as well, Rasheed said that this was not new. “Late fees were charged last year as well, we have a notification in this regard.” 
Apart from the penalty fees issue, the administrative control of the Board has also suffered ever since its reigns were handed over to the Commissioner Karachi. The Express Tribune was told by sources familiar with the matter that the Commissioner Karachi was handed responsibility of the Board in December of 2023, following the removal of the Chairman of the Board in November of 2023; since then the Commissioner Karachi has visited the Board only a handful of times. 
When The Express Tribune asked the Commissioner Karachi, Sohail Rajput, about his apparent inattentiveness to the affairs of the Board, he brushed off the matter. “This is the era of WhatsApp and Zoom. One does not need to physically visit an institute because it can be run through virtual meetings,” claimed Rajput while talking to The Express Tribune.

2,Sharjeel slams PTI for IMF threat,PPP leader says PTI has stooped to its nefarious practices of destabilising the country for its lust of power,"Pakistan Peoples Party leader Sharjeel Inam Memon said that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has again stooped to its nefarious practices of destabilising the country for its lust of power.
PTI has sent a letter to the IMF urging it to link the release of funds to the audit of the electoral process, Sharjeel said, “it is a shameful act.”
The PTI’s demand to freeze the funds for Pakistan means to cause economic misery for the people of the country, he said talking to The Express Tribune.

The recent move by PTI is an eye opener for the people of entire Pakistan, Sharjeel said and elaborated that PTI is trying to torment the entire country to get the power or to undo the elections.
“They (PTI) should put their concerns before Pakistani courts and public, rather than inviting foreign intervention.”
He said that the PTI is demanding of the IMF that an audit should be done first and then the funds for Pakistan should be released, otherwise the funds should not be released.
The purpose of this demand is to push the people of Pakistan towards an economic crisis. In this way the country will default.

3,‘Climate change impact unfairly burdens women’,Invaluable contributions of Pakistani women brought to forefront during two-day annual conference of Fem Consortia,"Despite myriad challenges, women continue to play a pivotal role in supporting and nurturing their families, with a particular emphasis on their resilience in the face of climate change impacts.
The invaluable contributions of women in Pakistani society were brought to the forefront during the two-day annual conference of Fem Consortia, a coalition of 12 women’s rights organizations and five alliances across Pakistan. 
Uzma Latif, presenting her groundbreaking research paper, shed light on the disproportionate effects of climate change on women, particularly in Sindh. 
Focusing on Thatta and Mirpurkhas districts in Sindh, Latif underscored how climate change has magnified women’s caregiving roles within households, leading to detrimental effects on their mental health. She highlighted that the aftermath of events like the 2022 floods and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to food shortages, disproportionately affecting women, with Sindh recording the highest proportion of underweight women, both pregnant and non-pregnant.
Javeria Afzal, the climate change advisor of Helpage International, called upon political parties to prioritize discussions on climate change and its specific impacts on women, particularly those residing in rural areas.

In a session focused on ‘Working Women,’ Rubina Jamil addressed the barriers faced by women in accessing economic opportunities, citing the lack of representation in decision-making processes and unequal wages. Jamil also highlighted the plight of women working in the agriculture sector, who often receive produce instead of fair wages.
Nuzhat Shirin highlighted shortcomings in existing legislation, particularly concerning home-based workers, urging for stronger legal protections. Despite these challenges, speakers acknowledged the resilience of women who continue to contribute positively to the country’s development.

4,Rs90m money laundering scam uncovered,"Legal action initiated against 12 importers, six clearing agents","The Customs Intelligence Karachi has uncovered a money laundering scam involving a whopping Rs90 million. Legal action has been initiated against 12 importers and six clearing agents for their alleged involvement in the scam.
As per information shared with The Express Tribune, Engineer Habib Ahmed, Director Customs Intelligence, was tipped off that several importers were exploiting Chapter 99 of the Pakistan Customs Tariff (PCT) to evade duties, resulting in losses to the national kitty exceeding Rs90 million. Acting on this information, Ahmed formed a team that conducted a comprehensive examination of consignments cleared under Chapter 99.
Twelve distinct importers, including M/s Bahawalpur Steel Mills, M/s Basheer Son Fancy Light, M/s SS Associates, M/s Supreme Oil Services, M/s Union Traders, M/s Ahmed Madax, M/s Haz International, M/s Dawood International, M/s Vertex Medical, M/s Musa Trading, were identified. Additionally, six clearing agents from M/s Moss Steel Furnace, M/s C&F Solution, M/s Zulfi International, M/s Maniya Enterprises, M/s Prime Business Corporation, M/s Quality Customs Brokers, M/s Vistampics, and M/s Tauheed Brothers were implicated.

Collectively, these entities obtained Customs clearance for 20 consignments under Chapter 99 of the PCT. Allegedly, payments were made through the illegal Hawala-Hundi money transfer channels against the consignments. The Electronic Import Form (EIF) for the 20 identified Goods Declarations (GDs) was not submitted to the Customs for clearance, and foreign exchange was sent through illegal channels for payment.
The Directorate of Customs Intelligence Karachi served notices to the importers under Section 26 of the Customs Act, 1969, seeking information on payments made through legal channels. However, the importers failed to provide any evidence of remittance of foreign exchange in compliance with payment regulations.
Documents revealed that the 12 importers had transferred $336,737 to foreign countries through illicit means. These entities were involved in the clearance of consignments for NGOs, hospitals, and other charities under Chapter 99, which are typically exempt from duty and taxes. 
However, the implicated importers, through collusion with clearing agents, systematically avoided the submission of electronic import forms, resulting in the clearance of 20 consignments and causing significant financial losses to the national exchequer.

5,Official sacked for exposing irregularities in WB-funded project,Revelations raise serious concerns about the transparency and integrity of World Bank-funded initiative,"In a shocking development, an official who blew the whistle on irregularities and abuses of power in a World Bank-funded programme to the Sindh secretary of school education has been sent packing. 
As per details available with The Express Tribune, the whistleblower, identified as HR Manager Hameed Alwani, detailed the alleged irregularities and misuse of power in a letter to the chief secretary and the secretary of school education.
Despite a ban from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on posting and transfers, Alwani was unjustly removed from his post. The letter sheds light on missing laptops, computer servers, and other equipment from the World Bank-funded programme, none of which were recorded in the official register. Moreover, five out of the 10 vehicles purchased for the project have mysteriously disappeared.

Two of the missing vehicles were recovered from the residence of a female project coordinator. According to the letter, the contract for the programme was awarded to VTT Global firm after receiving bid documents on a previous date.
The letter exposes the stoppage of HR Manager Hameed Alwani’s salary, contravening ECP orders. This punitive action was taken due to Alwani’s outspoken opposition to the illicit award of contracts worth millions of rupees to a private company within the programme.
The revelations raise serious concerns about the transparency and integrity of the World Bank-funded initiative, prompting a call for a thorough investigation into these alleged irregularities.
