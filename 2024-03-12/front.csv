0,PTI hits out at Adiala Jail ban,Party fears for the security of its founding chairman,"The PTI on Tuesday condemned the two-week ban imposed on all visits, meetings, and interviews within the Adiala Jail premises, where its founding chairman Imran Khan and other top leaders were incarcerated and also expressed concerns about threats to the life of the former premier.
Addressing the media in Islamabad, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan criticised the imposition of the blanket restriction for two weeks over the “excuse” that there was a terror threat.
He deemed the prohibition on meeting the party's founding chairman as unlawful. He lamented the abrupt imposition of a ban, preventing any individuals, including family members, from meeting Imran.
“We demand that before imposing this, his [Imran’s] family members and lawyers should have been notified,” Gohar added.
The PTI chairman recalled the “two assassination attempts” on Imran.
“Caging him all of a sudden is an indication that Khan sahib’s life is in danger.”
Gohar reiterated the illegality and unconstitutionality of the two-week blanket ban on meeting Imran, demanding immediate access for Wednesday's scheduled meeting.
He urged the authorities to provide updates on the PTI founding chairman’s health and security to both the party leadership and his family, while also calling for a transparent inquiry into the reasons behind the ban.
The PTI leaders, who were denied a meeting with Imran due to the ban, lashed out at the Punjab government.
Barrister Salman Safdar told a private TV news channel’s website that they were scheduled to meet with Imran on Tuesday but sent back as it was banned over “security concerns”.
Speaking to the media outside Adiala jail, National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan hit out at the Punjab government, saying that he and other PTI leaders were not being allowed to meet Imran despite court orders.
He further told the media that the ban on meeting with Imran and other PTI leaders had been imposed for two weeks.
Apart from the Imran, other party leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Parvez Elahi are also incarcerated in Adiala Jail.
An enraged Ayub said the Punjab home secretary should be ashamed for this action.
He added that the “so-called, unconstitutional and illegal chief minister” of Punjab Maryam Nawaz should be ashamed as well because this ban had been imposed under her watch.
Ayub said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi “should be ashamed” too.
The PTI MNA said the party “condemned the ban”, adding that the reason given for it was a “security threat”.
Ayub noted that it was his third visit to the jail on Tuesday but he was denied a meeting with Imran.
He too expressed concerns for Imran’s safety.
The PTI secretary general pointed out that the date for the Senate elections had been announced and the matter needed to be discussed with Imran, but the government was creating hurdles in making this possible.
PTI leader Raoof Hasan said the “blanket ban on meetings” with Imran was a “criminal act, which reflected the extent of fear the “unconstitutional and illegal” government of Punjab and their handlers suffered from.
In a post on social media platform X, he wrote that the ban would be challenged in court.
He hoped that immediate relief would be provided to the party and the provincial government would be “instructed to desist from repeating such draconian measures”.
“[Imran] Khan cannot be wished away by unleashing state fascism. The more the perpetrators try to do so, the more powerful Khan becomes. He rules the hearts.”
PTI MNA Sher Afzal Marwat said Imran faced a “prohibition against receiving visitors in Adiala Jail during the inaugural day of the sacred month of Ramazan”.
In video message shared on X, Marwat announced that he would challenge the ban in the Islamabad High Court.
“The expulsion of media personnel from the premises of Adiala Jail constitutes a measure starkly at odds with democratic principles. We vehemently denounce this dictatorial maneuver.”

At least 11 people were killed and many others injured on Tuesday in gas cylinder explosion-related incidents in Multan and Rawalpindi.
In Multan, around nine people died and two were critically injured when a residential building collapsed on an adjacent structure in Mohalla Jawadian area near Haram Gate following a gas cylinder explosion.
Rescue officials said the three-storied building collapsed after a cylinder exploded, with its debris falling on an adjacent house and burying the residents under the rubble. The father and son residing in the building where the cylinder exploded passed away. The victims who died in the mishap were identified as 50-year-old Umar, 21-year-old Waqar, 15-year-old Danish, 40-year-old Faheem, 12-year-old Ameer Ali, 14-year-old Waseem, 40-year-old Sanobar, 12-year-old Ibad, and 13-year-old Komal. Seven individuals belonging to the same family lost their lives when the debris fell on their house.
Rescue services shifted the critically injured to Multan's Nishtar Hospital. Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed sorrow over the loss of lives in the tragedy.
In a post on social media platform X, Maryam extended her heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved families and urged immediate action from the Multan commissioner for a thorough report.
In Rawalpindi, two minor siblings – a brother and sister – were killed and seven others suffered burn wounds in a four separate explosion caused by gas leakages in the garrison city.
One of the gas leakage explosions took place in a house in Bhabra Bazar in which two young siblings, three-year-old Ayat Fatima and six-month-old Arham, lost their lives.  In the explosion, 28-year-old Reema, the mother of the children, suffered 50% burns.
According to a Rescue 1122 spokesperson, there was a gas leak in one of the rooms of the house and the explosion occurred when the light was switched on.
The second gas leakage explosion took place at a house in Rawalpindi’s Tench Bhatta Abadi No 2 in which Abdullah and Ahsan were injured.
The third explosion caused by a gas leakage took place at a house in Arya Mohalla in which five people sustained burn injuries.
The injured included Intizar, Riaz Ahmed, Parveen, 26-year-old Ambreen and 15-year-old Amber. They were transferred to Benazir Hospital.
The fourth explosion occurred because of gas leakage at house on Rawalpindi’s Girja Road. Three people were injured in the explosion including two minor siblings -- 1.5-year-old old Shahzeb and three-year-old Noor Waqar -- as well as their mother Sobia.
The Rescue 1122 spokesperson said gas load shedding in different areas and minor negligence of the citizens were causing such accidents, particularly during the Sehri (wee hours of the day) time.
The spokesperson advised the citizens of Rawalpindi to be extremely careful while using Sui gas. He added that if a gas leakage was felt anywhere, the citizens should avoid pressing the fire and power buttons.
The spokesperson warned that in case of a gas leakage, turning on or off the power button and lighting the fire could cause an explosion.

2,Bar on Imran's visits after 'threat' to Adiala,"Two-week ban on visitations follows ‘alert’ issued by LEAs, spy agencies","The Punjab home department on Tuesday imposed a two-week ban on prisoner visitations as well as media coverage at Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, which houses high-profile political figures including PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan.
In orders issued to the Punjab police chief, the department maintained that the decision was made in light of a 'threat alert' issued for the prison by the law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
The department’s Internal Security Wing reported that terrorists – backed by anti-state groups -- wanted to target the prison to spread chaos in the country. Therefore, it added that it was imperative for the department to take the necessary measures to avoid such incidents.
Sources said the department had ordered the Special Branch, Intelligence Bureau, and Prisons Department to conduct a security survey of the jail on Wednesday (today).
It has also directed the installation of barbed wire around the boundary wall and the screening of the prison premises and nearby areas by the bomb disposal squad.
As per the home department’s directives, government contractors and staff employed at the jail will also undergo a security clearance by police and Rangers along with mock emergency drills.
The ban will be applied to all the inmates of the jail, including former premier Imran, former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, and PTI President Parvez Elahi.
It has been learnt following the directives of the home department, Punjab IG Prisons Mian Farooq Nazir has issued orders to Adiala Jail Superintendent Asad Javed Warraich that until the completion of the security survey and clearance operation at the prison, visiting inmates would not be allowed.
The provincial prisons chief had also issued orders to ensure that the ban and instructions were strictly implemented.
Read Jail official tenders apology in contempt plea moved by Imran
Last week, the police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) arrested three Afghan terrorists outside Adiala Jail and seized ammunition from their possession as well as a map of the prison.
Some time ago, two threatening calls were made to the official phone numbers of the prison and a case was registered in this connection.
Addressing a news conference in Islamabad, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan regretted the imposition of a “kind of blanket restriction” on visitations for two weeks.
He added that the authorities had carried out the move under the “excuse” of a terror threat, as he condemned the step.
Earlier in the day, the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM) filed a contempt plea at the Islamabad High Court against the Adiala jail superintendent for denying its party chief and other members a meeting with the PTI founding chairman on Monday.
The plea was filed by the MWM Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas.
Talking to the media after filing the plea, Nasir said that the jail authorities did not allow him to meet Imran despite a court order issued for this purpose on March 8.
He added that the prison officers made him wait from 9am to 4pm on March 11.
The MWM chief regretted that the situation in the country ""was worse than that in a jungle"".
“Even a jungle has more laws,"" he added.
Last month, several leaders of the PTI, including those elected in the February 8 general elections, were turned away by the Adiala jail as they reached there to meet with the party founding chairman.
The leaders said they had a court order for a meeting with Imran to discuss the prevailing situation and unfolding political developments in the country. However, the jail administration refused to obey these “court orders”.
The jail authorities allowed only five PTI leaders to meet with Imran  --Barrister Ali Zafar, Barrister Umair Niazi, Ali Bukhari, Shadab Jafari, and Ahmed Owais Advocate.
Those who were not allowed to meet Imran included PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan, Chief Organiser Omar Ayub Khan, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, ex-Azad Jammu and Kashmir prime minister Sardar Qayyum Niazi, Atif Khan, Shahram Tarakai, Sher Afzal Marwat, and Seembia Tahir.
After he was not allowed to meet with Imran, Qaiser said major developments were taking place in the country and it was necessary for the senior PTI leadership to consult the party’s founding chairman.
“The people have given a major mandate to the PTI founding chairman,"" he added.
