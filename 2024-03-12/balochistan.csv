0,Security beefed up around Noor Khan Airbase,"Directives aim to ensure safety, security of funnel area and designated flight path","Authorities at Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and Noor Khan Airbase have collaborated with Rawalpindi police to implement stringent security measures during the PAF’s flypast and rehearsals for the upcoming 23rd March Pakistan Day parade.
The directives aim to ensure safety and security around Noor Khan Airbase, the Funnel Area, and the designated flight path.
As part of the security restrictions, the enforcement of air traffic rules in the vicinity of Noor Khan Airbase will be rigorously monitored. Activities such as aerial firing, and flying pigeons and kites have been completely banned.
Rawalpindi police have intensified security in the areas surrounding Noor Khan Airbase, including the Funnel Area and the flight path. Additionally, strict monitoring has been started for individuals previously involved in aerial firing and pigeon flying incidents.
The Pakistan Air Force and Noor Khan Airbase authorities sent a letter to Regional Police Officer Rawalpindi, Syed Khurram Ali, and CPO Rawalpindi, Syed Khalid Hamdani. The letter underscores the potential hazards associated with aerial firing, pigeon and kite flying, and drone usage during flypast rehearsals, emphasising the importance of flight safety.
The preparations and rehearsals for the March 23 parade's flypast started in early March. The security survey proposed in the letter aims to detect and prevent activities that may pose a threat to aircraft and flight safety in the vicinity of the flight path and Funnel Area.
Furthermore, the directive specifies strict enforcement of bans on aerial firing, flying pigeons and kites, and flying drones from Gujar Khan GT Road to Islamabad Expressway, Khanna Bridge, and Noor Khan Air Base.
CPO Rawalpindi Khalid Hamdani has issued instructions to SP Pothohar, SP Saddar, and SP Rawal Division to ensure security within the limits of Rawalpindi in response to these recommendations. Consequently, Rawalpindi police have heightened security measures in the above-mentioned areas.

1,Traders call for promotion of industry,Say business community has been facing tough challenges,"The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry’s (FPCCI) Businessmen Panel (BMP) has said the business community has been facing tough challenges because of limited business.
In this context, it sought the attention of the government for the formulation of regional, provincial and central level task forces, and formulation of sector-wise regional policies which would help the government address the problems confronted by exporters.
Former FPCCI president and Businessmen Panel (BMP) Chairman Mian Anjum Nisar called for promoting industrialisation and enhancing exports by lowering the cost of production, paying early refunds to solve liquidity crunch and relaxing import policy for industrial raw materials.
He suggested that One Window Operation should be introduced the replace the lengthy procedures that involve the interaction of manufacturers with various agencies. The government agencies were harassing the textile industry every day. Social Security, EOBI and other taxes should be merged and deducted at the source.
Nisar asked the government to appreciate the role of industry for its potential to harvest maximum benefits, providing mass employment to the jobless population of the country. He also sought the government’s attention for formulating aggressive marketing plans and hurdle-free policies as well as urgent decisions in favour of exports while taking on board major stakeholders.
He called for concerted efforts to explore new markets both traditional and non-traditional to introduce homemade products. He urged the government to announce favourable policies and allow duty-free import of raw materials and accessories. This move will attract investors and help in setting up new industries in the country which will create wide employment opportunities.
We direly need a stimulus economic plan coupled with a relief package by the government to maximise production. He also emphasised the need for seeking technical know-how from China and other countries for the sake of innovation, and improvement of products.
The BMP chairman said the sustainable solution to Pakistan’s problems lies in reforms, as we can see very large inefficiencies in tax collection. So, tax compliance must be improved and the tax base be broadened. This cannot be achieved with a single policy change, but by a systemic approach, he added.
He observed the government preferred direct taxation to meet revenue shortfall as opposed to resorting to increasing indirect taxes because direct taxes tend to be more progressive; therefore, the burden on the lower income strata of the population is lesser.

2,Hospitals report influx of pollen patients,Sharp spike causes prices of related medications to skyrocket,"The onset of the pollen season in Rawalpindi and Islamabad has triggered a surge in patients, putting a strain on both public and private healthcare facilities in the twin cities.
Numerous individuals affected by pollen allergies have opted to relocate from Rawalpindi and Islamabad to other cities to escape the worsening conditions.
Hospitals and private clinics in the twin cities are grappling with long queues of pollen allergy patients, encompassing men, women, and children. Alongside this influx, the prices of pollen allergy prevention medications have experienced a staggering increase.
The prevalent cause of the surge in pollen allergies can be attributed to the excessive presence of wild mulberry trees in both cities.
The proliferation of thousands of wild mulberry trees in Rawalpindi and Islamabad initiates the onset of pollen allergies as the trees start producing new leaves and wild mulberry fruits with the advent of spring, lasting from March 1 to April 30.
The current period marks the peak of pollen allergy cases, a recurring issue persisting for the past five decades in the twin cities without a definitive solution.
Benazir Bhutto Hospital Deputy Medical Superintendent Dr Anayat highlighted common symptoms of pollen allergy, including itchy skin, runny nose, headaches, red eyes, red spots, coughing, and severe breathing difficulties. The transmission of pollen allergy is attributed to wild mulberries and other herbs. Preventive measures recommended include minimising outdoor activities, keeping windows shut to prevent pollen infiltration, maintaining a dust-free environment, ensuring cleanliness of bedding, and using clean water.
To mitigate the impact, pollen sufferers are advised to refrain from visiting parks, recreational areas, and walking on grass during this season.

5,Paintings immortalise poets’ work,Art gallery hosts exhibition honoring nexus of literature and the arts,"An exhibition of paintings based on the poems of 20 contemporary poets was organised by the Katas Raj Art Gallery in collaboration with the Academy of Literature Pakistan at the academy’s conference hall.
The exhibition was inaugurated by prominent poet and the chief guest of the event, Iftikhar Arif. Paintings by Wasi Haider, MH Silhari, Mahmood Ali, Asif Iqbal, Ustad Jacob, Zafar Iqbal, Gulb Bhai and Amna Batool were included in the exhibition.
The contemporary poets, whose poems had been selected for the paintings included Iftikhar Arif, Salim Kausar, Yasmin Hameed, Ahmed Hussain Mujahid, Imdad Akash, Hameeda Shaheen, Rehman Hafeez, Khurshid Rabbani, Abid Siyal, Shamsher Haider, Shazia Akbar, Ihsan Shah, Dr Riaz Adil, Sajjad Baloch, Tayyab Raza, Imran Aami, Nadeem Bhabha, Naveed Haider Hashmi, Ahmed Attaullah Atta and Shakeel Jazeb.
Iftikhar Arif said “Painting is known as the oldest art in the arts, and it is also a historical fact that the interpretation of the first poetry was preserved on stones in the form of painting. The traces of civilizations are its witnesses.”
He added, “There are many signs of this in the last century in South Asia as well. Urdu poetry has its unique tradition in the form of images. Abdul Rehman Chughtai interpreted Ghalib and Iqbal while Sadiqain reflected Ghalib and Faiz’s poetry in pictures and among the modern painters, Aslam Kamal gave pictures to the words of Iqbal, Faiz and other poets.” He also appreciated Nauman Farooq's artistic efforts.
The President of the Academy of Literature, Pakistan, Dr Najiba Arif, said that the priority of the academy was to emphasise the collaboration of literature with other arts, so that people from different arts could understand each other's points of view and help each other and could benefit from each other’s movements.
Nauman Farooq, the curator of Katas Raj Art Gallery, said “According to me, all branches of fine arts grow from the same source. I have tried to combine the two branches of poetry and painting.” In the next phase, the gallery has planned to hold similar exhibitions with respect to other genres of literature. The exhibition was attended by writers, poets and people from other walks of life of the twin cities.

7,Deserving households to get ‘Eid gift’,Zakat beneficiaries have been deprived of cash handouts for the past 10 months,"The District Zakat Council has decided to give Rs12,000 each to the zakat deserving families registered in the entire district as an Eid gift in the last ten days of Ramazan in keeping with the Eid festival’s spirit of charity.
Zakat Committee District Chairman will be appointed next week while banks and financial institutions across the country will deduct zakat from the accounts of citizens on the 1st of Ramazan.
Zakat beneficiaries of Rawalpindi district have been deprived of aid money and monthly living allowance for the last 10 months. However, recently, the requests of Zakat committees of 43 districts across Punjab seeking Zakat funds before Eid have been approved.
The government has also decided to reinstate local Zakat Committees. The committees had been dissolved on completion of their term and had not been reinstated since the past year across Punjab due to which deserving people have been continuously deprived of Zakat aid money.
The election of 1,166 local Zakat Committees of Rawalpindi district is likely to be completed in the second week of Ramazan. At present Zakat Committees are run by administrators while deputy commissioners are District Zakat Administrators.
On the upcoming Eid-ul-Fitr, Rs12,000 will be given as an Eid gift to 7,000 deserving families in the Rawalpindi district. Due to the non-availability of zakat funds for the past year, free treatment of patients eligible for zakat funds has also remained discontinued in all 17 government and other major hospitals.
Due to the non-availability of funds, operations and dialysis of Zakat Fund patients could not be done in hospitals in the past. Leprosy patients and their families have not been given financial assistance. It is reported that many patients lost their lives while waiting for the promised free treatment.
Similarly, failure to provide eligible families with marriage grants worth Rs 25,000 or scholarships has also impacted the lives of many young children belonging to poor families.
According to sources at the District Zakat Committee, computerised data of all beneficiaries is available. This Eid, gift money will be sent to the beneficiaries' mobile accounts from EasyPaisa who will be able to claim it wherever they want. The Zakat Department will also cover the EasyPaisa money exchange and retrieval fees.

8,Cardiologist warns against poor lifestyle,"Says unhealthy diet, inactivity lead to cardiovascular diseases","A health expert urged the public to adopt a healthy lifestyle which includes daily exercise, regular heart checkups and maintaining their weight in order to avoid heart-related deaths as the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) is alarmingly on the rise globally, and in Pakistan as well.
A senior cardiologist, Major General (R) Azhar Mehmood Kayani advised the public that the risk of heart-related deaths can be reduced by adopting a healthy lifestyle and urged them to regularly get their complete heart check-up to avoid possible heart attacks.
He emphasised the importance of raising awareness among the masses regarding cardiovascular disease and its prevention, adding that laziness and lack of outdoor activities are the root causes of heart disease.
He said people should adopt a healthy lifestyle as well as do exercise to protect themselves from cardiac diseases. Dr Kiyani said there is a dire need to take cardiac diseases seriously and work on their prevention, adding that diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and inactive lifestyle were major reasons for heart attacks.
In addition to genetic factors, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity and poor diet, including consumption of fast food and oily foods were major risk factors for heart attacks, he said.

9,Book on China’s rise at global stage launched,"Participants ponder factors behind Chinese progress, challenges","A book authored by the Asian Institute of Eco-Civilisation, Research and Development (AIERD) CEO Shakeel Ahmad Ramay was recently launched in the federal capital.
The launching event of ‘China at 75: China Story – Standing Up to Getting Rich to Becoming Strong’, was jointly organised by the Institute of Regional Studies (IRS) and AIERD.
While speaking at the event, Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed said the ingredients of China’s success story were its quality leadership, ability to do course correction, continuity of policy and peaceful foreign policy.
Senator Sayed said China could be explained in three words - revolution, reform and rise, and each era was led by a leader right from the front.
He said if we look at all the leaders that have led China we would see that they were a product of merit-based system.
Giving the example of the current Chinese president, Xi Jingping, and its former leader Deng Xiaoping, Sayed said these leaders had integrity and had risen from the grassroots level.
Talking about course correction, the senator said when you feel that perhaps we are not on the right track, you do a course correction, which the Chinese leadership had done successfully.
He said other aspects were continuity of policy that had spanned decades, humility and the urge to learn from others. However, the most important ingredient was China’s peaceful foreign policy, he added.
Elaborating his point, Sayed said China was the only permanent member of the UN Security Council that had not fought a war with any country during the last 40 years.
He said President Xi Jingping was a leader with a difference, who was confident, competent and had strategic clarity.
He said by the time Mao Zedong died, China had resolved the core issues of its people, which were food, clothing, shelter, health and basic education.
He said Pakistan was fortunate to have China as its neighbour, which was its all-weather friend, strategic partner and iron brother. Delving on Ramay’s book, Mushahid Hussain Sayed said the author had told China’s story very well and had captured the country’s evolution in detail.
Speaking on the occasion, Shakeel Ahmad Ramay said he had divided his presentation into three parts – standing tall, getting rich, and becoming strong.
He said when the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949, the country faced several challenges.
