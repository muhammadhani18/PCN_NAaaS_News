0,New finance minister appointed,Experienced banker brought in as IMF mission to review on March 14,"The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government appointed Muhammad Aurangzeb, a career banker, as the Federal Finance Minister on Monday, giving him preference over its old economic guard and entrusting him with the responsibility of steering the economic ship out of stormy waters.
Aurangzeb took the oath of office on the day the International Monetary Fund decided to dispatch a mission to Pakistan. A senior finance ministry official told The Express Tribune that the Pakistan-IMF talks are beginning from March 14th –Thursday.
Securing an immediate new bailout package from the IMF will be the topmost priority of the new finance minister.
The government has assigned Aurangzeb the portfolio of the finance ministry, with the additional responsibility of the Revenue Division. This suggests that another minister will eventually take over this portfolio. Similarly, Ahad Cheema has been tasked with the portfolio of the Economic Affairs Division.
The IMF mission is set to reach Pakistan in the next 48 hours for the completion of the last review of the current programme and to begin negotiations for the new deal, said the senior finance ministry official.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has placed a bet on Muhammad Aurangzeb to lead his economic team. Aurangzeb’s hands will be strengthened by bringing in more people in the core economic team. Sharif plans to run the finance ministry’s affairs through a consultative process.
After Aurangzeb, the role of the Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal will be most critical. Bosal is considered a close confidante of the PM and has good relations with all stakeholders. Bosal has also been credited for the smooth completion of the current IMF programme.
Aurangzeb’s appointment brings an end to the formal role of former finance minister Ishaq Dar in Pakistan’s economic affairs, which began in 1998. Dar remained the finance minister four times, but Sharif has taken a different route to uncharted territory.
Aurangzeb tendered his resignation as President and CEO of Habib Bank Limited (HBL) on Monday, following his appointment as a federal minister. He was president of HBL for six years.
Aurangzeb is a former Citi banker and has also served in JP Morgan’s Global Corporate Bank based in Singapore and at ABN AMRO in Amsterdam. Aurangzeb, who renounced his Dutch nationality and was granted a Pakistani nationality on Monday evening, received his BS and MBA degrees from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. Aurangzeb had previously renounced his Pakistani nationality in favour of the Dutch nationality.
By bringing in an outsider as finance minister, the PML-N has lost its claim on having an experienced in-house economic team. Dar’s departure from the financial front marks the beginning of a new era for PML-N and Aurangzeb too.
Sources said that the finance ministry was hopeful for the timely completion of the last programme review carrying the bonanza of over $1.1 billion loan tranche under the current programme expiring next month. Unlike in the past, the duration of the upcoming visit might be shorter this time. Pakistan has already met the conditions for the second review programme. The majority of the talks are expected to focus on the new bailout programme, which will be linked with the next budget, said the finance ministry officials.
The main conditions related to the external sector and budget have been met by Pakistan, including the primary budget target. As against the condition to have a primary deficit of Rs1.42 trillion, the government has shown a surplus of Rs1.8 trillion. Last time, however, the government missed the primary budget condition of the IMF.
Against the condition of spending Rs905 billion on health and education by all the governments, Pakistan has spent over Rs1 trillion in six months. The government has claimed that it has restricted the increase in the power sector circular debt to Rs378 billion in six months as against the maximum requirement of Rs385 billion.
The FBR has also met its conditions related to net taxes collected during the first half and Rs43 billion additions in the tax refunds.
However, the government could not meet the condition to make the Central Monitoring Unit in the Ministry of Finance operational by end November. This, however, does not have any negative impact on the overall target.
The central bank has also met its conditions related to the Net International Reserves and foreign currency swap.
The real test will be the next programme, and the new finance minister is keen to kick-start negotiations during the upcoming review talks, said sources. Pakistan has momentous external financing requirements for the next fiscal year, but its quota in the IMF limits the size of the financing to around $6 billion. The exact financing requirements and the IMF loan size will be determined during the review talks.
Last week, the IMF spokesperson said that the fund’s aim is to support the implementation of strong policies to deepen financial stability, address long-standing economic and underlying balance of payments challenges, and restore sustained and inclusive growth for the benefit of all Pakistani citizens.
The spokesperson further elaborated that in order to achieve these objectives there is a need for Pakistan to ensure stronger public finances, through high-quality revenue measures to broaden the tax base while scaling up the support for the most vulnerable.
The IMF is also pushing Pakistan to increase the tax burden of the salaried and the business individuals again by reducing the number of tax slabs –a move that would be highly counterproductive and could create unease among the salaried persons.

1,"Bitcoin hits record above $71,000",Flows of capital into 10 largest US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds slowed to a two-week low in the week to March 8,"Bitcoin hit a record high on Monday above $71,000, as the surge in the biggest cryptocurrency showed no signs of slowing down.
Britain’s financial watchdog on Monday became the latest regulator to pave the way for digital asset trading products after saying on Monday it will now permit recognised investment exchanges to launch crypto-backed exchange-traded notes. Bitcoin rose by as much as 4.8% to a record $71,677 in European trading, bringing gains for the year so far to 70%.
The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has been boosted by a flood of cash into new spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds as well as hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.

Flows of capital into the 10 largest US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds slowed to a two-week low in the week to March 8, but still reached almost $2 billion, according to LSEG data.
“Bitcoin has started the week with a surge, dragging the rest of the cryptocurrency space higher with it,” DailyFX strategist Nick Cawley said. Supply of bitcoin, which is limited to 21 million tokens, is going to get tighter in April, when the so-called halving event takes place.

2,E&P firms to step up efforts to find new deposits,"Hope to receive outstanding dues from gas utilities, which will improve cash flow","Pakistan’s oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) firms are expected to ramp up efforts to find new hydrocarbon deposits on hopes of improvement in revenue collection from gas utilities, indicating that new discoveries will keep fuel reserves stable after persistent depletion for quite a long time.
In a commentary, Optimus Capital Management Research Analyst Fabeeha Ali said “looking ahead, in line with anticipation of enhanced exploratory activities with recent energy sector reforms, we expect positive reserve replacement in future, at least leading to sustained reserve profiles of E&P companies.”
Talking to The Express Tribune, the analyst elaborated that energy reforms included a significant increase in gas prices by the government twice in the past four months (in November 2023 and February 2024), aimed at overcoming the revenue shortfall faced by gas utilities ie, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and addressing the circular debt crisis.
The availability of improved liquidity to the gas marketing companies will allow them to clear current and pending dues of oil and gas exploration firms, resulting in an increase in their cash flow. The shortage of financing with E&P firms was one of the major hindrances in the way of drilling new wells, testing and finding hydrocarbon reserves.
The research analyst pointed out that the piling up of receivables of E&P companies was mainly owing to delay in payments by the gas marketing companies, which had to pay about 50% of the total dues. On the other hand, oil refineries used to clear all their dues payable to the exploration firms.
The latest update suggests that the circular debt in Pakistan’s energy sector soared to Rs5.725 trillion as of November 2023. It comprised power sector circular debt of Rs2.703 trillion and gas sector circular debt of Rs3.022 trillion.
Ali said total recoverable reserves of oil in Pakistan remained largely stable over six months, closing at 193 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) in December 2023, up 0.03% from June 2023. Total recoverable reserves of gas came in at 2,786 MMBOE in December 2023, down 1.25% from June 2023.
Oil and gas reserves, however, depleted by 14% and 5%, respectively, in the past one year from December 2022 to December 2023.
As per available data, the remaining life of oil and gas reserves in Pakistan is nine years and 16 years, respectively. Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDC), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), Mari Petroleum Company Limited (MPCL) and Pakistan Oilfields Limited (POL) have oil reserves life of seven, six, 23 and seven years, respectively.
On the other hand, they have gas reserves life of 19, 10, 15 and seven years, respectively. Substantial fresh reserves of 12 million barrels of oil and 264.6 billion cubic feet of gas have been added from Al-Haj’s 92 Kot Palak field to Pakistan’s reserves portfolio.
Jhim East block of PPL has added another 0.4 million barrels of oil and 24.7 billion cubic feet of gas while OGDC’s Nim East added only 0.3 million barrels of oil and 1.8 billion cubic feet of gas.
MOL’s Tal block had remaining oil and gas reserves of 19.1 million barrels and 521.3 billion cubic feet as of December 2023 whereas original gas reserves of Tolanj West had increased by 41.4 billion cubic feet.
Gas supply timings
SSGC announced that it would ensure uninterrupted gas supply during Sehr and Iftaar timings during Ramazan.
However, it must be kept in mind that around 10% depletion in the country’s gas reserves annually had led to the widening of demand-supply gap.
“For this reason, in order to ensure improved gas pressure, SSGC would be carrying out gas pressure profiling (load-shedding) from 9am to 3pm and then during night from 10pm to 3am during Ramazan,” SSGC said.

3,JV with Chinese solar firm to bring $700m in investments,"Includes establishment of distribution networks, dealer’s network, warranty and service centres","The shift towards electricity generation through solar energy is becoming a rising trend in Pakistan, driven by the soaring prices of electricity, which domestic, commercial and industrial users are paying through different distribution companies, haunting the public at large.
Though the trend of installing solar panels by households is not new, many owners previously tended towards this cheap mode of electricity provision, and some are also benefiting from reverse metering.
This fast-paced development is likely to further speed up, as governments are now also looking towards solar energy to provide cheap electricity to low-income households. Provincial governments like Punjab have successfully penetrated solar energy panels in rural areas, largely to operate tube wells, which previously were operated on costly diesel fuel.
Against the backdrop of such developments, many companies are now looking to enter and invest in this lucrative market, either independently or via joint ventures. However, Chinese companies apparently are taking the lead in this race.
In the latest development, a Chinese company, Hanersun Technologies, has entered into an agreement with a local company My Energy to collaborate for the provision of 500 MW solar system projects.
Under the terms, an investment of $700 million will be made for the joint venture involving different 500 MW solar projects. This will include the establishment of distribution networks, dealer’s network, warranty and service centres, as well as flagship stores.
Read: Chinese solar firm eyes growth in Pakistan
My Energy, CEO, Tariq Wazir Ali emphasised the importance of providing sustainable energy solutions in the country. “Pakistan currently relies heavily on expensive furnace oil and diesel for electricity generation,” he said. There is a potential for significant cost savings and the need to shift towards cleaner energy sources such as solar power, he added.
Ali also stressed the importance of focusing on the steel and agriculture sectors in terms of solar energy solutions. He announced plans to complete several 500 MW projects under the joint venture within the first year of this JV.
Hanersun Technologies, Vice President, Sunny Sun acknowledged the lack of quality solar energy products in Pakistan and expressed the company’s commitment to working with the local counterpart to address this issue. “This JV aims to offer affordable energy solutions to the people of Pakistan and promote sustainable energy practices in the country,” he said.
Energy sector experts said that there is a dire need for the introduction of high-tech solar solutions in Pakistan. They said that energy prices are not likely to come down; in fact, there is a high probability that the per unit cost of electricity and gas will further increase due to International Monetary Fund conditions. People by and large are looking to control at least their electricity bills via solar energy.
However, they warned that people may lose hope if they may not be able to get reliable and long-lasting solar energy solutions. “Solar energy is not a cheap product; the decision to install solar solutions may wipe out savings, especially for households. Government institutes should also initiate checks and balances on companies offering such solutions with price control mechanisms, besides promoting this sector, so that the desired results may be achieved,” suggested the experts.

4,AJK to get telecom licence fee,"Govt approves changes to law for transferring fee, spectrum proceeds to AJK govt","The federal government has made amendments to the law for transferring the licence fee, renewal fee and spectrum auction proceeds received from telecom operators working in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) to the regional government.
So far, the fee and proceeds got from the licensees have been parked in Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) as an agent of the AJK Council. Now, the government has amended the law to provide the fee to the AJK government.
The decision was made in a recent meeting of the cabinet. The Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan recalled that the matter was earlier submitted to the cabinet in its meeting held on February 6, 2024 by the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication.
The cabinet directed the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs to prepare a summary, in accordance with the Rules of Business, 1973 and by incorporating the views of relevant ministries, for consideration in the next cabinet meeting.
Explaining the background, the meeting was informed that the prime minister had constituted an inter-ministerial committee with the defence minister as its convener to examine and make recommendations relating to the payment of licence fee, renewal fee, and spectrum auction proceeds to the AJK government.
The inter-ministerial committee, in its meeting on December 29, 2023, decided to form a sub-committee to examine the issue. After detailed discussion, the sub-committee recommended that since the licence fee, renewal fee, spectrum auction proceeds, etc received from the licensees operating in AJK were parked with PTA as an agent of the AJK Council, the IT ministry may initiate a summary on the release of such fee to the AJK government for approval of the cabinet.

The inter-ministerial committee, while endorsing the proposal of the sub-committee in a meeting held on January 18, 2024, directed the IT ministry to send a summary to the federal cabinet as a top priority.
The IT ministry explained that Section 5(2) of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council Adaptation of Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organisation) Act, 2005 (the Adaptation Act) provides that PTA shall transfer 50% or more of the fee received from licensees to the AJK Council.
It was added that by virtue of Article 51(2) of the AJK Interim Constitution, 1974, all laws made by the AJK Council prior to the AJK Interim Constitution (Thirteenth Amendment) Act, 2018 shall continue to be in force and the reference of words “Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council” made in existing laws shall be construed and understood to be a reference to the AJK Assembly, the government of Pakistan, or the government of AJK, as the case may be.
In the instant case, as the subject of telecommunication falls under Article 31(3), read with Part-A Third Schedule of the AJK Constitution, the words “Azad Jammu & Kashmir Council in Section 5(2) of the Adaptation Act shall be construed as government of Pakistan.”
It was explained that since that created an anomaly, the IT ministry submitted a summary to the cabinet proposing that in the presence of Section 5(2) of the Adaptation Act in its current form, PTA was liable to transfer the fee received from the licensees operating in AJK to the government of Pakistan, whereas the proceeds actually belonged to the government of AJK.
During the ensuing discussion, it was explicated that Part-A of the Third Schedule of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974 referred to legislative competence, not necessarily to any direct service delivery obligations or rights to revenue collection; that as per scheme of the AJK Interim Constitution, 1974, the competence to legislate on the subject of telecommunication rests with the government of Pakistan, which included amending Section 5(2) of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council Adaptation of Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organisation) Act, 2005, as had been proposed.
It was further explicated that the proceeds in question never formed part of the government of Pakistan’s non-tax revenues and were passed on to the government of AJK through the AJK Council.
Following the discussion, the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs sought approval of the cabinet for the requisite amendment in Section 5(2) of the Adaptation Act with effect from the date of promulgation of Azad Jammu & Kashmir Interim Constitution (Thirteenth Amendment) Act, 2018.
The cabinet considered the summary titled “Payment of Licence Fee, Renewal Fee and Spectrum Auction Proceeds to the Azad Government of the State of Jammu & Kashmir” dated February 7, 2024, submitted by the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, and approved the proposal.

5,PC leads efforts to revamp framework,"Chairman stresses need to define federal, provincial jurisdictions","Chairman of the Planning Commission, Muhammad Jehanzaib Khan, stated on Monday that efforts were underway to enhance the National Planning Framework in collaboration with provinces and stakeholders, intending to incorporate it into the National Economic Council’s agenda. He made these remarks at the opening ceremony of a workshop on the National Planning Framework organised by the Ministry of Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives.
The National Planning Framework defines national objectives for planning and development at the national level, ensuring alignment of developmental policies and projects. Khan emphasised the government’s responsibility for public welfare and prosperity, stressing the need to clearly delineate federal and provincial jurisdictions regarding development sectors and areas. He countered the perception that provincial governments lack human and financial resources. Khan underscored the necessity of establishing solid foundations for resource utilisation, enhancing capabilities, and improving talent management within provinces.
The National Planning Framework acts as a bridge between federal and provincial governments, establishing guiding principles for resource utilisation and defining the roles of each level of government in setting national priorities. It aims to ensure effective utilisation of national resources, correct direction of development, and foster harmony between federal and provincial governments
Secretary of the Ministry of Planning, Awais Manzur Sumra, highlighted the extensive consultations held during the preparation of the framework. The workshop aimed to gather feedback from relevant authorities for formal submission to the NEC.

6,Rupee comes down from 4-1/2-month high,"In the open market, however, the rupee maintained its uptrend for the fourth consecutive working day","The stabilising Pakistani currency ticked down Rs0.04 and closed slightly below Friday’s four-and-a-half-month high at Rs279.08 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market on Monday.
The currency recorded the nominal drop after Pakistan’s central bank reported that its foreign exchange reserves further decreased $54 million to $7.89 billion in the week ended March 1, 2024. It indicated that the supply of foreign currency continued to remain thin in the banking system.
According to SBP data, the domestic currency hit four-and-a-half-month high close at Rs279.04 against the greenback of Friday. The currency has cumulatively surged 10.05%, or Rs28.06, over the past six months until March 8. 
Read: Rupee rises to 4-1/2-month high vs dollar
In the open market, however, the rupee maintained its uptrend for the fourth consecutive working day with gains of Rs0.07 at Rs281.61/$, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan. Accordingly, the disparity between the two markets narrowed to Rs2.53 (or 0.90%), down from over Rs3, or 1%, early last week, well below the maximum limit of 1.25% (around Rs4) recommended by the IMF.
The maintenance of the difference within the prescribed ceiling has helped Pakistan meet a key condition of the global lender. It will pave the way for a successful review under the maturing $3 billion IMF standby arrangement, resulting in receipt of the last tranche of $1.1 billion in March or April 2024. The release of loan installment will improve Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves to nearly $9 billion.
In addition, the satisfactory gap between currency values will also enable the country to conveniently win the next IMF loan programme, potentially worth $6-8 billion, once the current standby arrangement concludes in April 2024.

7,Industry leaders decry skyrocketing gas prices,"Call for govt, SIFC intervention as businesses struggle to survive","Expressing condemnation of the over 220% increase in gas tariffs within one year, business leaders have appealed to the newly-elected government and the Special Investment Facilitation Council to take notice, review the situation, and primarily focus on research and development (R&D) aimed at ensuring alternative fuel sources for the local industry.
In an interview with The Express Tribune, President of the Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Adil Siddiqui, highlighted the necessity for the government to prioritise R&D to provide alternative fuel options for the local industry. He pointed out the limitations of solar and wind energy projects in certain regions like Punjab, where cloudy weather predominates, while suggesting that wind energy projects may be suitable for areas like Thatta, characterised by strong winds. Siddiqui underscored the urgent need for cost-effective alternative fuel solutions, citing the significant burden on industries in the current economic climate. He illustrated the impact by highlighting the drastic increase in utility bills faced by small industries, which have risen from Rs10 million to Rs30 million per month.

All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) South Zone (Sindh), Chairman, Zahid Mazhar highlighted the adverse effects of the 223% increase in gas tariffs within a year. He stated that this surge has led to a 30% capacity closure among firms in the textiles and apparel sector, with the remaining facing a high risk of complete closure in the coming weeks due to becoming uncompetitive in the international market compared to regional competitors such as India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam. Mazhar lamented the underutilisation of the textile industry’s export capacity, amounting to $600 million per month, attributing it primarily to the high energy costs that hinder local industrialists’ ability to compete globally.
He explained that the export-oriented textile industry is rapidly deteriorating, leading Pakistan to lose market share in the global marketplace due to the alarming rise in energy tariffs. Mazhar highlighted the disparity in energy costs, with local industries paying significantly higher rates than their counterparts in competing countries. He noted that while Pakistan provides grid electricity at Rs52 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) or 18 cents/kWh, competing countries offer much lower rates like India which charges $6.5/mmBtu, Bangladesh $7.5/mmBtu, and Vietnam $9.80/mmBtu for gas or RLNG for the textile sector.
Calling for an immediate reduction in gas prices and ensuring uninterrupted supply to industries, President of the Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry, Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani, expressed concerns about the inadequate gas supply provided by Sui Southern Gas Company Limited, which operates for only 15 out of 24 hours per day with dangerously low pressure. He also criticised the reduction in gas supply during Ramazan, as per the issued notification, stating that such actions only exacerbate the challenges faced by industries. He alleged manipulation of statistics, claiming that exorbitant bills ranging from Rs10,000 to Rs12,000 are being collected under the guise of irregular services.

8,"PSX wipes out all gains, falls marginally","KSE-100 index sheds 38.45 points, settles at 65,755.31","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday came under downward pressure from selling of selective stocks and the benchmark KSE-100 index registered a marginal decline of nearly 40 points.
The weakening of global equities and growing apprehensions about economic uncertainty in Pakistan drove the stock market down, after wiping out all the earlier gains.
In the morning, the bourse began trading on a positive note with the momentum being fuelled by the formation of a new cabinet, whose members took oath during the day.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif convened the first cabinet meeting in the evening. As a result, the market briefly crossed the 66,000 mark, reaching intra-day high at 66,119.34 points post-midday trading.
However, concerns surrounding the upcoming monetary policy announcement and the outcome of government’s negotiations for a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan package led to a shift in sentiment.
Consequently, the index struggled to maintain the 66,000 level and eventually fell to the intra-day low at 65,698.76 points right before close.
“Stocks closed under pressure amid weak global equities and concerns over economic uncertainty in the country,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Uncertainty about monetary policy announcement on March 18 and concerns over the outcome of government negotiations for a new IMF loan played the role of catalysts in negative close of the market.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a slight decrease of 38.45 points, or 0.06%, and settled at 65,755.31.

Topline Securities Deputy Head of Sales Ali Najib, in his report, said that earlier buying momentum could be attributed to the formation of the cabinet, which took oath on Monday.
“However, 66,000 has so far proved to be a ‘quagmire area’ where bullish forces face tough competition and eventually surrendered for the fifth time since last week,” he said.
Power, fertiliser, tech, auto and pharma sectors contributed positively to the index as Hub Power, Fauji Fertiliser, Pakistan Telecommunication Company, Millat Tractors and The Searle Company added 95 points.
On the flip side, Dawood Hercules Corporation, Pakistan Services and Nestle Pakistan saw stock selling as they collectively lost 160 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported that there was “additional flirting with 66,000 at the commencement of the week as tech names remained strong.”
Hub Power (+1.23%), Millat Tractors (+1.18%) and Fauji Fertiliser (+0.73%) were the biggest contributors to the index’s gains, it said.
Tech names Air Link Communication (+7.5%) and Pakistan Telecommunication Company (+8.11%) were both limit up and the sector was expected to remain strong.
Other notable performers were Hascol, Hi-Tech Lubricants, Ghandhara Industries and Crescent Steel, which “has now gained 33% MTD (month to date)”.
“HBL CEO Muhammad Aurangzeb has resigned from his post and is among the 19 who took oath as ministers in PM Shehbaz’s cabinet and is the front runner for the finance ministry,” AHL report added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 548.8 million shares against Friday’s tally of 481.7 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs16.6 billion.
Shares of 357 companies were traded. Of these, 220 stocks closed higher, 118 dropped and 19 remained unchanged.
Cnergyico PK was the volume leader with trading in 96.5 million shares, gaining Rs0.22 to close at Rs5.11. It was followed by Hascol Petroleum with 52.3 million shares, gaining Rs0.66 to close at Rs8.50 and Kohinoor Spinning Mills with 27.3 million shares, losing Rs0.21 to close at Rs5.31.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs50.2 million, according to the NCCPL.
