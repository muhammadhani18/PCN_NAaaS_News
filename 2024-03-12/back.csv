1,X users weigh in on crucial appointment after Aurangzeb takes charge of finance,"Some hopeful about finance chief's 'corporate' background, others think Pakistan requires 'an economist'","The most-awaited appointment - after the premier - has been announced, and serves as a fresh break from tradition for the PML-N-led government. The country's new finance czar is a career banker, and the internet has something to say about this appointment.
The former HBL CEO and Wharton graduate's appointment was widely expected, suggesting a shift in the PML-N's approach, as it was rumoured that the party would not continue with four-time finance czar Ishaq Dar at the helm of economic affairs.
Aurangzeb's appointment comes amid a debilitating economic crisis and the need for Pakistan to secure a crucial IMF programme, which will be of utmost priority for the new finance chief.
A former Citi banker, Aurangzeb has also served in JP Morgan’s Global Corporate Bank based in Singapore and at ABN AMRO in Amsterdam. He has tons of experience under his belt. However, some users still found his gleaming “corporate” background to be insufficient to meet the challenges that lay ahead.
While some were hopeful of the finance chief's gleaming ""corporate"" background, others thought Pakistan required ""an economist"" to turn around the country's crippling economy.
Does he have any experience in Public Finance ? I doubt it a commercial banker is not a good choice for state finances Shamshad Akther would be far better choice !
 
Muhammad Auran­gzeb, current CEO of HBL, is definitely a credible name, with an excellent track record in banking.

If he has to lead the finance ministry of a country, which has no money to repay its debts, he must be fully empowered and taken as Federal Minister rather than a…
 
 
MBAs are not economists. Manmohan Singh who set India on the path to Economic prosperity is an economist. Let us rise above blind party loyalties. pic.twitter.com/TFDwEvAOlU
 
Bankers have never been able to manage economy well. Shaukat Aziz, Shaukat Tarin its a long list.
Not all were gushing though on the choice of the appointment, or anybody’s for that matter. Users expressed hopelessness with the system, declaring it had “no mercy for the poor”.
I’m delighted it’s not Ishaq, but so long as he doesn’t go into MOFA because I’ve never seen more of a car crash interview with him than BBC hardtalk. A native speaker of the English language would be great, if we can manage to find one.

Miftah Saab also went to Wharton. And…
Some were highly appreciative of the appointment, while others were willing to wait out how the finance chief's tenure pans out.
Muhammad Aurangzeb is more than a banker. He has held senior global management positions with top banks of the world. At these positions, understanding of the economic conditions play a key role in the success of your job.

He is an MBA from Wharton, one of the top ranked… https://t.co/5rrGgHvTzC
 
@NajamAli2020 Oh undoubtedly he is an extremely high profiled banker but only concern I would have is that he is not an economist and I think that’s what Pakistan needs - Especially now.

3,FIA opposes right to appeal in cypher conviction,IHC seeks arguments on appeal against cypher case convictions," 
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday ordered detailed arguments on the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) contention that the appeals against the conviction of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan and senior leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the cypher case were inadmissible.
A two-member division bench, comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb, asked the FIA prosecutor to inform the court how the appeals were not admissible and sought counterarguments from the lawyers for the appellants.
During a hearing of the appeals, FIA Special Prosecutor Hamid Ali Shah raised the objection that the appeal was not filed under the Official Secrets Act, as the law granted no such right to appeal. He added that the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was also silent in this regard.
Secondly, the prosecutor continued, the two-member bench could not hear the appeal. However, Barrister Salman Safdar, the lawyer for the PTI founder, told the court that the same objection was raised on the bail application, but then the court had decided that it could hear the matter.

The court remarked that even if the objection was sustained, the proceedings would not end, but the appeal’s status would change.
The chief justice remarked that no one could be left without compensation. Justice Aurangzeb said that the court would first decide the main objection.
The chief justice further remarked that the question raised by the prosecution had to be seen, as there were many issues in this case about the first impression. He sought detailed arguments and adjourned the hearing until March 13.
Separately, the District and Sessions Judge of Islamabad, Shahrukh Arjumand, sought arguments on March 20 on a separate application for suspending the punishment of Bushra Bibi in the Iddat Nikah case. During a hearing, Bib’s first husband, Khawar Manika, sought grant of time to engage a lawyer.

4,"SC sets rule for integrity, competence","Says officials of a disciplined force must show utmost integrity, uprightness"," 
The Supreme Court has ruled that any person who wants to be part of a disciplined force should be a person of utmost integrity and uprightness with an unimpeachable, spotless character, and clean antecedents.
The court has also highlighted the importance of proper and impartial investigation in criminal cases, while noting that the police force is a disciplined force with significant accountability and the responsibility of maintaining law and public order in the society.
""No doubt, an Investigating Officer (IO) plays a crucial role in the administration of the criminal justice system and the constituent of investigation report and its worth keeps hold of plenteous value and repercussions on the outcome of any criminal case.
""However, at times, a botched-up investigation can become a top impediment and stumbling block in the administration of justice,” said an eight-page judgement authored by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar.
Justice Mazhar was leading a three-member bench that heard the appeal of a police official who was removed from service by the Sindh Service Tribunal on account of a defective investigation in a minor’s rape case. The bench upheld the tribunal’s verdict.
The SC’s order said a botched-up investigation can either be intentional with the aim to favour an accused or unintentional due to inefficiency, incompetence, or unskillfulness of the IO.
""The criminal justice system signifies the procedure for adjudicating criminal cases in order to award a sentence to the culprits for the offence committed by them. The foremost objective is to penalize the offenders subject to the proof whether the offense has been committed or not.
“This very important aspect is attached with the burden of proof on the prosecution which has direct nexus with the investigation report and the material and evidence collected by the IO in discharge of his sacred duty to bring out the truth without engaging in any manipulation, favoritism, or exceeding the bounds of the law.”
The SC noted that a defective investigation gradually contaminates the judicial process and poses a hazard to human rights. In unison, it is the duty of superior officers and officers in charge of police stations to ensure that an IO follows the provisions of law conscientiously.
""The task of investigation is an art and for attaining the proficiency in the job of investigation, extensive on-job training is also required to ensure integrity and uprightness, without any temptation for personal gains or advantages.
“It is also a foundational pathway for the prosecution case, and being a sacrosanct duty of an IO, it should be performed without any recklessness, sluggishness, or greediness,"" it said.

Citing Section 4 (l) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the court stated that the term “investigation” includes all the proceedings under the CrPC for the collection of evidence conducted by a police officer or by any person.
It said this duty or task was also given much significance under Rule 25.2 of the Police Rules, 1934 which deals with the power of IOs. Under Sub-rule 3, the SC said, it is provided that it is the duty of an IO to find out the truth of the matter under investigation.
""His object shall be to discover the actual facts of the case and to arrest the real offender or offenders. He shall not commit himself prematurely to any view of the facts for or against any
person,” it said.
The court also mentioned Section 166 (2) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which says that if an IO fails to carry out the investigation properly or diligently or fails to pursue the case in any court of law properly and in breach of his duties shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both.
""Section 27 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, provides that if an Anti-Terrorism Court or a High Court comes to conclusion during the course of or at the conclusion of the trial that the IO, or other concerned officers have failed to carry out investigation properly or diligently or have failed to pursue the case properly and in breach of their duties, it shall be lawful for such Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, to punish the delinquent officers with imprisonment which may extend to two years, or with fine or with both by resort to summary proceedings.”
It said a similar provision has been incorporated under Section 22 of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021.
“[It] explicates that whoever [is] entrusted to investigate scheduled offences, fails to carry out the investigation properly or diligently or causes the conduct of false investigation or fails to pursue the case in any court properly and in breach of duties, shall be guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment which may extend to three years and with fine.”

The PTI had organised the protests to demand the restoration of what it claims to be its ""stolen mandate"" from the February 8 election, as well as the immediate release of party leaders, including founder and former premier Imran Khan.
The Lahore demonstration, initially intended to voice these demands, turned violent as PTI members and supporters clashed with the police. Numerous videos circulating on social media depicted scenes of police officers wielding sticks and forcibly detaining protesters inside police vehicles.

The petition argued that the inclusion of independent members in the SIC should be deemed a violation of multiple articles in the Constitution, specifically Articles 5, 9, 17, 25, and 51.
It further implored the top court to restrain the speakers of the national and provincial assemblies from recognising the Sunni Ittehad Council as a political party.Highlighting that the SIC failed to secure even a single seat in the elections, the petition contended that the inclusion of independent members is contrary to Article 51(6)(d).

This came as 90 MNAs affiliated with PTI opted to join the SIC after participating in the general elections as independent candidates, aiming to secure reserved seats. However, the SIC remains deprived of the reserved seats.

8,Sharif sons return after seven years,"Hasan, Hussain arrive in Lahore, Nawaz welcomes sons at Jati Umra","The sons of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Hassan Nawaz and Hussain Nawaz, made returned to the country after seven years on Tuesday following the suspension of their arrest warrants by an accountability court.
Sources within the Sharif family revealed that the brothers touched down at Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore, where they were swiftly transported under tight security to Jati Umra, the ancestral home of the family.
PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif warmly welcomed them at Jati Umra. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, their sister, also met with her brothers, who paid respects at their late mother Kulsoom Begum's grave and offered Fatiha.
The warrant suspension came after the Islamabad court, on March 8, revoked the obligation for Hassan Nawaz and Hussain Nawaz to appear in the relevant court, a status held for seven years.
Also read: Nawaz sons' arrest warrants temporarily lifted
An accountability court judge, Nasir Javed Rana, announced the decision in a verdict reserved earlier that day, extending the suspension until March 14.
The warrants were initially issued when the court declared the brothers absconders, a status that has now been lifted. Last week, the accountability court suspended the arrest warrants in the Al-Azizia, Flagship, and Avenfield cases.
While Mr Sharif was convicted in the Al-Azizia reference in December 2018 but acquitted in the Flagship Investment reference, he, along with Maryam Nawaz and her husband retired Capt Safdar, challenged their convictions in the Avenfield reference before the Islamabad High Court.
Upon Mr Sharif's return to Pakistan in October last year, the IHC set aside his convictions, marking the latest chapter in the ongoing legal battles of the Sharif family.
