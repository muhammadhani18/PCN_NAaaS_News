0,"PHC seeks response of KP speaker, his deputy in contempt case",Opposition MPAs claim court orders violated as oaths not administered to them.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Wednesday put the speaker and deputy speaker of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on notice, seeking their response to a plea for contempt proceedings against them over their failure to follow the court’s orders to administer oaths to opposition MPAs elected to reserved seats.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Syed Arshad Ali held a preliminary hearing into a contempt petition filed by four opposition women MPAs-elect, who also sought its orders for the disqualification of Speaker Babar Saleem Swati and Deputy Speaker Suriya Bibi from holding any public office for “willfully flouting” the March 27 orders of the high court.
The petitioners, including Shazia Tehmas of the PPPP and Faiza Malik, Amina Sardar and Shazia Jadoon of the PML-N, insisted that the speaker should have done the necessary correspondence for the requisitioning of the session of the assembly and including administering oaths to the MPAs as Agenda Item No 1 by April 2, but the process for their swearing-in wasn’t initiated, defying the court’s time-bound orders.
Aamir Javed and Barrister Saqib Raza, lawyers for the petitioners, said their clients and several other MPAs, who were notified as MPAs elected on reserved seats, had petitioned the court to declare that the denial of oaths to those lawmakers was illegal and unconstitutional.

Opposition MPAs claim court orders violated as oaths not administered to them

They said the petitioners further requested the court to direct the respondents, including the speaker and the deputy speaker of the assembly, to administer oaths to them to enable them to participate in the April Senate elections.
The lawyers insisted that the high court accepted those petitions on March 27 and directed the speaker to administer oaths to the petitioners and facilitate their participation in the Senate elections.
They added that not only the counsel for the respondents was present, but the order was pronounced in the open court as well, and that the order was also disseminated through print and electronic media.
The counsel, however, complained that the oath-taking ceremony hadn’t taken place until now, in open defiance of the court’s orders.
They said that the respondents had been dragging their feet on the matter.
The lawyers said the attitude and conduct of the respondents were tantamount to the contempt of the court, and therefore, they were liable to be prosecuted and punished accordingly.
The speaker of the assembly has already filed a review petition with the high court requesting it to recall its March 27 orders.
The petition was taken up for a preliminary hearing on April 2 by a bench, which decided to conduct further proceedings over it after the detailed judgment in the case was released.
MORE PETITIONS FILED: Two more contempt petitions were filed on Wednesday by some opposition members against the speaker, deputy speaker, and secretary of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
One of the petitions came from six women MPAs of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, including Aiman Jalil Jan and others, while the other was filed by PML-N member Afshan Hussain.
The petitioners insisted that the act of the responders to defy the judgement of the high court was absolutely intentional.
They added that if such acts continued and the perpetrators were not punished, the people would feel bad about it.
The petitioners also requested that the court direct the speaker and the deputy speaker to implement its orders without delay.

1,Govt likely to increase BRT fare,PESHAWAR: Adviser to the chief minister on finance Muzamil Aslam has said that the provincial government is likely ...,"PESHAWAR: Adviser to the chief minister on finance Muzamil Aslam has said that the provincial government is likely to increase the fare of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service to arrest its deficit and divert the subsidy paid in this regard to other useful heads. 
Talking to reporters during his visit to Peshawar Press Club on Tuesday night, he said since the launch of the service in 2019, no increase had been made in its fare despite manifold hike in electricity tariff and prices of petroleum products. 
He said currently the provincial government had to pay an amount of over Rs3 billion per annum in head of subsidy in the fare of BRT service. He said a budgetary proposal regarding increase in the fare would be submitted to the government. 
Regarding financial condition of the autonomous organisations, he said various such institutes, particularly universities, were spending more than their sanctioned expenditures. 
To a question regarding debt of the KP government, Mr Aslam said it had only a debt of Rs630 billion as compared to Rs1,700 billion of Punjab. 
The debt of KP government is merely $2.5 billion, which could be paid easily. He said good aspect of the KP debt was that it was external and not domestic. 
He expressed concern over the growing government expenditure, saying a huge part of its receipts was spent on payment of salaries to government employees, and steps were underway to bring reforms in it.

3,Mystery surrounds death of eighth grader in Mansehra,"School insists that the 13-year-old died a natural death, while his family contradicts the assertion.","MANSEHRA: Mystery surrounded the death of an eighth grader here on Wednesday as the school insisted that the 13-year-old died a natural death, while his family contradicted the assertion.
A doctor at the King Abdullah Teaching Hospital said currently, it would be premature to say anything with certainty about the cause of the death.
“We’re carrying out medico-legal processes on the body and will share the outcomes with police only after receiving the lab report,” he told reporters.
Ali Shahzad, a student in eighth grade at the Tameer-i-Watan Public School and College’s Ghazikot campus, was shifted to the Kath in critical condition. He died shortly thereafter.
Sajid Mehmood, an uncle of the deceased, lodged an FIR with the City Police Station, suspecting that the school’s administration was “involved” in the death of the student.
He, however, didn’t cite any reason for it.
The police said the deceased’s father worked in Dubai.
In a post on its Facebook page, the school expressed condolences over the death of the student and insisted that Ali Shahzad showed signs of distress in recess and fainted in the washroom, suffering critical injuries.
It added that the boy was rushed to the King Abdullah Teaching Hospital but didn’t survive.
Mohammad Amjad, a police official who heads the reporting room at Kath, said the police registered a case and began an investigation to ascertain the exact cause of the death.
“We await the postmortem’s report, are gathering circumstantial evidence, and will record statements of the deceased’s family and the school’s administration about the death,” he said.
He said the police handed over the body to the family after Kath doctors completed medico-legal formalities.
HELD: Police have arrested over four dozen narcotics dealers after seizing a large cache of drugs in separate raids here.
District police officer Shafeeullah Gandapur told reporters here on Wednesday here that he had given all 17 SHOs of the district 10 days to eliminate networks of narcotics dealers from their respective areas.
He said the SHOs failing to comply with his orders would be removed.
Mr Gandapur said the police seized 67kg of charas, over 3kg of ice drug and almost one kilogramme of heroin and arrested 48 narcotics dealers.
He said the police had formed special teams to crack down on narcotics.

6,KP govt plans massive vaccination drive against childhood diseases,EPI official says measles claimed 13 lives in province in one year.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department has planned to begin a massive vaccination campaign after the outbreak of measles, diphtheria, and other childhood diseases in the province.
Director of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Dr Mohammad Arif Khan told Dawn that 1,400 people were infected with measles and 13 killed by the highly contagious disease in the province during the last one year.
“The main issue we face is that 75 per cent of the people infected with measles were aged over two years. That happened because most of those children missed routine immunisation due to the busyness of our staff members with coronavirus-related activities since 2020,” he said.
Dr Khan said besides measles, diphtheria also broke out in the province, with most sufferers being more than two years of age.
He said commonly, the children aged below two were infected with those highly contagious diseases.

EPI official says measles claimed 13 lives in province in one year

“After the onset of Covid-19, most of our 3,500 staff members got busy with pandemic-related activities because it was a global emergency. They collected samples from suspected people, and the exercise was followed by contact-tracing of the coronavirus-positive people and their vaccination along with others,” he said.
The official said the EPI administered Covid-19 vaccine jabs to 80 per cent of the people as per global guidelines, but in the process, it couldn’t cover children for vaccination, leading to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.
He said during the Covid-19 pandemic, the government went for frequent lockdowns, including smart ones, so it wasn’t possible for health workers to reach the targeted population amid focus on Covid-related activities.
Dr Khan said recently, the health department held a meeting with the Unicef, World Health Organisation and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation leading to an agreement about the launch of the “Big Catch” campaign in August.
He said the campaign would target children less than five years of age for vaccination against childhood diseases, while its second and third rounds would take place in the months of September and October, respectively.
“This situation prevailed in most of the countries, especially the developing ones, with authorities focusing their attention on the fight against Covid-19, so routine immunisation was badly affected,” he said.
The official said Gavi would provide all logistical support for the upcoming vaccination drives.
He said the province’s population under two years of age was 1.1 million, but the EPI would vaccinate all children aged below five, who totaled eight million.
“Even before the start of the Big Catch campaign, our 2,000 vaccination centres at public sector hospitals were open to the vaccination of children,” he said.
Dr Khan said the EPI had already taken the Pakistan Pediatrics Association and community elders on board to ensure the vaccination of children at fixed centres for their protection from diseases.
“Immunisation is the only way to protect children from killer diseases and ensure their growth, and therefore, the responsibility for their vaccination lies with their parents. This will promise a better future for them,” he said.
The official said trained vaccinators in the province, who had played a significant role in the fight against Covid-19, would be part of the efforts for the elimination of measles and other childhood diseases.
“We have also enlisted the support of religious scholars, who are persuading people about the vaccination of their children. The campaign will also include polio vaccination,” he said.
Dr Khan urged people to ignore “propaganda” against vaccination against polio and other diseases for the protection of their children’s good health.

Officials of the district administration, election commission, district police officer Kashif Zulfqar, local leaders of political parties and the contestants were in attendance. 
Mr Haq briefed the participants about the code of conduct issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan for the April 21 by-elections on NA-8 and PK-22.

They said there were 1,200 senior secondary schoolteachers waiting for promotion. They said several SSTs had retired before their promotion to grade 17 due to unnecessary delay from the quarters concerned.

9,PTI demands judiciary’s intervention for end to ‘political victimisation’,Hammad also calls for probe into ‘poisoning’ of Bushra Bibi in sub-jail,"PESHAWAR: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Hammad Azhar on Wednesday said the judiciary should play its constitutional duties, check the victimisation of political workers, and save the country from “further destruction.”
During a news conference at the Peshawar Press Club, Mr Hammad claimed he was implicated in 51 fake cases for speaking against the plunderers of national wealth.
He said detained PTI founder Imran Khan was fighting for the people’s rights, so he would continue standing with him.
“I will never leave my leader [Imran] and will continue to be loyal to him, the party, and the workers,” he said, urging superior courts to dispense justice to the victims of political victimisation.

Hammad also calls for probe into ‘poisoning’ of Bushra Bibi in sub-jail

The PTI leader said the party’s activists were approaching the Peshawar High Court to claim legal rights, and the other courts should think about it.
He said the Punjab police had falsely claimed to have registered 23 cases against him.
“I’ve been named in 51 cases in Punjab just because of my loyalty to Imran in testing times,” he said.
Mr Hammad complained that the Punjab police arrested his 82-year-old father, raided the houses of his sisters, and threatened to arrest them.
He claimed that hundreds of PTI leaders and workers were oppressed by authorities in the last 10 months.
The PTI leader demanded that the chief justice of Pakistan intervene for the relief of those detainees.
He said if the CJP was under pressure not to dispense justice in cases of political victimisation, then he should step down.
Mr Hammad said Imran had always raised his voice for the rights of the people, the strengthening of the judiciary, the rule of law, and the upholding of the Constitution.
He said many attempts were made to suppress the PTI founder, but to no avail, as he didn’t bow down to the “unprecedented pressure.”
The PTI leader criticised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his cabinet for “failure” to deliver the goods.
“The common man is struggling to make ends meet due to the high inflation rate of 28 per cent. The negative national growth rate will add to his misery,” he said.
Mr Hammad said the country’s largest province, Punjab, was handed over to the PML-N through manipulation of election results.
He said the PTI didn’t make any deals with the rulers to serve its own interests, and instead opted to fight for people’s rights and freedom.
The PTI leader voiced concern over “threats” to the lives of the members of higher judiciary and demanded the formation of a full court by the Supreme Court chief justice to look into the matter.
He said had such threats been reported in a western country, its government would have fallen.
Mr Hammad claimed the PTI emerged as the country’s largest political party in the Feb 2024 general elections, but its majority in assemblies was turned into a minority through Form 47 rigging. He complained that the judiciary did not take notice of that electoral injustice against the PTI.
The PTI leader demanded an investigation into the alleged poisoning of the PTI founder’s wife Bushra Bibi at the Banigala sub-jail.
He condemned social media and internet restrictions in the country and urged the people to support his party for the elimination of corrupt rulers.

He regretted that TMA and WSSC had no mercy on the poor workers, who had not been paid for months.

It met on the lawns of the Ghazi tehsil municipal administration, with tehsil council chairman Sahibzada 
Qasim Shah, heads of the affected village councils, and local notables in attendance.
The NTDC is set to install power transmission lines and pylons for supplying electricity from 1530mw Tarbela 5th Extension hydropower project to the National Grid.
The participants discussed the project slated for completion in May 2026 and its impact on the local population and the agriculture sector.
They said Ghazi residents sacrificed their fertile lands for Tarbela Dam, but those sacrifices were hardly acknowledged by authorities.
The participants said the installation of transmission lines and pylons would render hundreds of acres of land in Kundi, Hamlet, Khairbara, and Kotehra union councils “useless for future housing and development.”
They said four transmission lines and pylons were already installed on the route.
The jirga demanded appropriate compensation for landowners affected by the project.
It also called for the launch of community development projects in line with the conditions set by the World Bank, the funding agency for the Tarbela 5th Extension project.
The jirga demanded an end to power outages in the areas affected by Tarbela Dam projects.
It also said dumpers were damaging the main Ghazi roads, so the activity should be banned.

The suggestion was made during a groundbreaking consultation on community-led ‘climate-resilient water governance models in Pakistan’. The event was hosted by the International Rescue Committee and the National Disaster Risk Management Fund and aimed to gather expert insights on enhancing resilient water governance systems and policy reforms to tackle the challenges posed by extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, exacerbated by the impacts of climate change.
Experts highlighted the scarcity of skills and technical personnel to promote market-oriented water management and the need for proper data for informed decision-making. 
They emphasised the importance of documenting lessons from past experiences to inform future strategies and policies, as well as promoting private sector support for value addition in agriculture sectors in hill torrent areas.
They stressed for clear guidelines for engaging semi-urban/urban segments in water governance systems.

Talking to reporters here, Lower Chitral acting district police officer Abdul Sattar said different facilities were made available at the Khidmat Markaz. 
He said it consisted of six different sections, including command and control room, Ababeel Squad control room, licence section, traffic education section, police assistance lines and gender response section.

RESULTS CHANGED: Result of the election for president of Chitral chapter of Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) has allegedly been changed to hand over win to the losing candidate. 
This was claimed by Zaheer Baber, a supporter of Kamal Abdul Jamil, one of the contenders for the president’s slot. 
He told Dawn that the Electoral College consisted of the presidents of football clubs registered with PFF, and there were 13 registered clubs in Chitral having the right of vote. 
He said presidents of the clubs participated in the voting process through WhatsApp, claiming that seven had voted in favour of Mr Jamil, but the results were altered. 
He said to their utter surprise and dismay, a notification was issued declaring Ejaz Ahmed the winner with seven votes. 
He said Mr Jamil had filed an appeal against the results, and requested for vote recount.
