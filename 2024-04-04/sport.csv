0,Bracewell named New Zealand captain for Pakistan tour,"The 33-year-old all-rounder was a surprise selection to lead the squad, having missed last year’s 50-overs.","WELLINGTON: Michael Bracewell will captain New Zealand for the first time on their Twenty20 tour of Pakistan this month, with a host of top names missing because they are playing in the Indian Premier League.
Pakistan host New Zealand for five Twenty20 internationals, starting in Rawalpindi on April 18, as both teams warm up for June’s T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies.
The 33-year-old all-rounder Bracewell was a surprise selection to lead the squad having missed last year’s 50-overs World Cup with an Achilles rupture and played his last T20 international more than a year ago.
He will fill in for the absence of regular skipper Kane Williamson, who is playing for Gujarat Titans in the IPL.
Bracewell said that being informed he would captain New Zealand had capped a “golden three days” last month when he also took eight wickets for his club Wellington and had a hole-in-one playing golf. 
“It’s three days that I’ll never forget,” Bracewell said. “I’m very excited, it’s a huge honour just to be picked again for New Zealand and then on top of that selected as captain. I wasn’t expecting that.” 
IPL contracted players Trent Boult, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitch Santner and Williamson are all missing.
New Zealand Test captain Tim Southee is being rested after a busy summer of cricket across all formats while Will Young, Tom Latham and Colin Munro are also unavailable. 
Big-hitting batsman Tim Robinson and fast bowler Will O’Rourke received their first Twenty20 squad call-ups.
O’Rourke impressed on debut with the test side against South Africa in February, while Robinson earned his spot with a torrent of runs for Wellington in the domestic Super Smash competition.
“We have picked a squad with a lot of power and exciting bowling options,” said New Zealand selector Sam Wells.
New Zealand won 4-1 in a home five-match Twenty20 series against Pakistan in January.
Squad: Michael Bracewell (captain), Finn Allen, Mark Chapman, Josh Clarkson, Jacob Duffy, Dean Foxcroft, Ben Lister, Cole McConchie, Adam Milne, Jimmy Neesham, Will O’Rourke, Tim Robinson, Ben Sears, Tim Seifert, Ish Sodhi.

1,Inter­national Boxing Associ­ation may appeal after CAS upholds IOC decision to withdraw recognition,"“For boxing to lose its place at the Olympic Games would be devastating for boxers at all levels in every part of the world,” says World Boxing.","LAUSANNE: The Inter­national Boxing Associ­ation (IBA) said on Wednes­day it is analysing a decision by global sport’s top court to dismiss its appeal against the withdrawal of its Olympic recognition and it may take the case to the Swiss Federal Tribunal.
The International Olym­pic Committee (IOC) decided in June to strip the IBA of recognition over its failure to complete reforms on governance, finance and ethical issues.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rejected the IBA’s appeal on Tuesday.
The IBA said in a press release on Wednesday that it had made considerable progress in the areas mentioned by CAS, and that the court and the IOC had overlooked its extensive reforms.
“The IBA will refrain from further comments until the CAS award has been thoroughly analysed by its legal experts which is taking place right now to draw a conclusion whether the organisation appeals to the Swiss Federal Tribunal,” it added.
The IOC said it welcomed the decision by CAS and it was now up to the national boxing federations and national Olympic committees (NOCs) to find a partner international federation by next year at the latest to keep the sport in the Olympics.
“To keep boxing on the Olympic programme, the IOC needs a recognised and reliable International Federation as a partner, as with all the other Olympic sports,” it said in a statement.
The boxing tournaments at the Paris Games this summer are being organised by the IOC but the Olympic body has repeatedly said it could not continue doing that.
“The NOCs and national boxing federations thus hold the future of Olympic boxing in their own hands, and the required actions cannot be clearer,” the IOC said.
“At the moment, boxing is not on the sports programme for the Olympic Games LA28. In order to remedy this, the IOC needs to have a partner International Federation for boxing by early 2025.”
Rival body World Boxing, who last month said it will seek recognition from Olympic organisers to replace the IBA and keep the sport on the programme for the 2028 Los Angeles Games, claimed they should be the new federation the IOC partners with.
World Boxing added that any NOC that thinks their boxers have a future at the Olympics without joining their federation would be making a  “grave error”.
“For boxing to lose its place at the Olympic Games would be devastating for boxers at all levels in every part of the world,” World Boxing said.
“This is an urgent situation and the clock is ticking. The leaders of boxing’s national federations now have a critically important decision to make.
“We urge every one of them that cares about boxers and the future of the sport to apply to join and support World Boxing in its efforts to ensure boxing remains at the heart of the Olympic Movement, before it is too late.”

2,Russia steps up attack on IOC chief Bach,Zakharova said this amounted to a “conspiracy” between the IOC and Ukraine to exclude strong Russian athletes from the Games.,"MOSCOW: Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach on Wednesday of discrediting international sport and contradicting the principles of the Olympic movement.
At her weekly briefing, Zakharova also repeated her call for an inquiry into Bach’s actions.
Bach was tricked into holding a conversation with Russian pranksters, published on Tuesday, in which he said the IOC had asked Ukraine to provide it with information on Russian athletes and officials as part of a monitoring process.
This was to make sure that no athletes who had made political statements in support of their government could take part in this year’s Paris Olympics.
Zakharova said this amounted to a  “conspiracy” between the IOC and Ukraine to exclude strong Russian athletes from the Games.
“All this demands deep, thorough analysis, study and investigation. Because people like Thomas Bach discredit world sport, they discredit the Olympic movement,” she told reporters.
Relations between Russia and the IOC have worsened in the run-up to the Paris Olympics, starting on July 26 where Russian and Belarusian athletes will compete as neutrals, without their flags and anthems, and be excluded from the opening parade.
They were initially banned from competing internationally following Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a  “spe­cial military operation”.
Believing he was speaking to an African sports official, Bach also said in the hoax call that he would be very grateful for help in limiting African participation at a multi-sport Friendship Games that Russia plans to host this year.
The IOC said last month that Russia’s plan to hold  “purely politically motivated sports events”  violated  the principles of the Olympic charter and countries should not take part in them.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday that Bach’s attitude towards Russia’s plans to host international sports events was  “unacceptable” and the IOC was damaging the Olympic movement by refusing to dissociate itself from politics.

3,Sri Lanka sweep Bangladesh Test series with crushing win,CHITTAGONG: Lahiru Kumara finished with 4-50 to help Sri Lanka thump Bangladesh by 192 runs in the second Test and...,"


 
CHITTAGONG: Lahiru Kumara finished with 4-50 to help Sri Lanka thump Bangladesh by 192 runs in the second Test and sweep the two-match series 2-0 on Wednesday.
The fast bowler dismissed last man Khaled Ahmed to wrap up a one-sided contest before lunch on the fifth day in Chittagong.
Hosts Bangladesh, chasing a mammoth 511 in their second innings, added just 50 after resuming on 268-7.
Mehidy Hasan Miraz staged a lone fight to stay unbeaten on 81 after completing his sixth Test half-century.
With a Sri Lankan triumph all but inevitable when the day began, Mehidy played some positive strokes to bring up his fifty off 68 balls.
He lost overnight partner Taijul Islam for 14 when the batsman drove off-spinner Kamindu Mendis to Nishan Madushka at gully.
Kamindu finished with 3-32 to go with his unbeaten 92 with the bat in the first innings, earning him the man of the match award.
He was also named player of the series after scoring a hundred in both innings of the first Test. 
“The bowlers did their basics on this wicket and the batters did their job as well,” Sri Lankan captain Dhananjaya de Silva said. 
“The batters were a bit disappointed about not getting runs in the first Test, but we have experienced players. I was confident they would get runs,” he added. “There wasn’t a lot of spin on offer. So I thought about reverse swing as a way to get wickets. The pacers were really on the spot.” 
Sri Lankan pacers accounted for 33 of the 40 Bangladesh wickets to fall, a rare feat on Bangladesh’s generally spin-friendly pitches.
Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said the home side’s poor showing for the red-ball series would provoke some soul-searching. 
“If you look at our batting, everyone got set but didn’t get a big score. That’s something to think about,” he said. 
“If you get set, you have to make a score. We have to play more first-class cricket.” 
Sri Lanka won the first Test in Sylhet by 328 runs. They also triumphed in the three-match T20 series 2-1 but lost the one-day international series by the same margin.
Bangladesh will host Zimbabwe for five T20s in May in their next international engagement, ahead of the T20 World Cup starting in June.

4,Pakistan Football Federation NC finally announces results of elections in 75 districts,"“Over 90 percent of voters participated in the electoral process,” said the PFF NC.","KARACHI: Twelve days after the voting period closed, the Pakistan Football Federa­tion Normalisation Committee finally announced the much-awaited preliminary results of elections in 75 districts across the country on Wednesday, taking a second major step after the completion of club registration and scrutiny towards having an elected PFF.  
The final list of elected officials, the PFF NC said, will be shared after an appeals window of two days and there was some resentment among the stakeholders after the initial list was shared.  
“Over 90 percent of voters participated in the electoral process,” said the PFF NC in a news release, vowing that the elections in the remaining districts will be held after Eid-ul-Fitr.  
“Following a thorough electoral process, the individuals have been duly elected to lead and represent their districts in the matters concerning football development and administration.  
“In adherence to the principles of fairness and transparency, two days are hereby allotted for appeals. This window allows for any concerns or disputes regarding the electoral process to be addressed and resolved appropriately. Once the appeals are decided, the final list of the elected officials will be shared.” 
Pakistan football has been mired in controversy and conflict for the best part of the last decade and despite global football body having appointed the NC in September 2019 to oversee affairs, the road to the elections has been a long and tedious one.  
The club registration and scrutiny took an excruciatingly long time and for the district elections, the NC had gone against the PFF Constitution to give freshly-registered clubs the right to vote.  
According to the constitution, newly-registered clubs have to wait for a two-year period before being given the right of vote and the NC’s move had drawn the ire of the stakeholders, some of them having argued that it had stripped established clubs of its right to vote.  
“They struck off 15 clubs in Islamabad which have been established for a long time and we have gone into an appeals process,” a member of a contesting group led by former court-elected PFF chief Ashfaq Hussain Shah told Dawn on Wednesday.  
Ashfaq’s group has accused the Haroon Malik-led NC of working against it after it seized control of the PFF headquarters in April 2021, a move that saw Pakistan suspended by FIFA for a 15 months.  
“They NC has also made Islamabad a district, while according to the constitution, the Islamabad Football Association has the status of a provincial association,” added the member.
In Rawalpindi, there were accusations of a tie in the votes by the losing party. “We have the proof that we’ve exactly half of the votes and we’re going into appeal,” a member told Dawn on Wednesday.
The preliminary results, however, saw some familiar names being elected from their districts.   
Former PFF senior vice-president Syed Zahir Ali Shah, who will be running for the PFF presidency, won from Peshawar and told Dawn that he was hoping that the elections in the remaining districts are held soon.  
“It’s the first step,” said Zahir. “The NC included new clubs in the voting process but we prevailed.”  
Former PFF Congress member Mohammad Nauman, who is likely to challenge Zahir for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa presidency, was elected president of the Malakand district.  
Well-informed sources have told Dawn that Nauman has the blessings of the NC to contest for the PFF presidency.  
“An appeal against Nauman was also filed in the PFF disciplinary committee, accusing him of forgery by a club in Malakand, but the NC has taken no action,” sources said.  
Jameel Islam, the injured party and president of Batkhela XI, contends that Nauman made himself the president of his club in order to contest the district elections from Malakand. 
“The PFF legal committee has done nothing despite the submission of all the documents,” a rueful Jameel told Dawn on Wednesday. “For the last three months, the case has been pending with them but no action has been taken.” 
Jameel also accused Nauman of “fielding bogus clubs during club scrutiny and they were all registered”. He also shared documents that declared his presidency of Batkhela XI. 
Elsewhere, Nasir Karim Baloch won the election of president from Karachi South and said that his panel prevailed “despite several newly-registered clubs” having been added.  
“We got almost 100 votes out of 113,” he told Dawn.  
There will be re-elections in some districts due to a tie while results of Karachi Malir will be announced later, according to the PFF NC.  
Once elections in all districts are completed, the district presidents will elect the provincial football association body. Three members each from the four provinces — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan — and one from the IFA become part of the PFF Congress.  
The Congress, which also has eight votes from departments and one each from the Pakistan Football Referees Association and the champion of the National Women’s Champi­onship, elects three more members for a quorum of 26, which elects the PFF president.

5,Lacazette fires Lyon into French Cup final,PARIS: Alexandre Laca­z­ette scored twice as Olympique Lyonnais def­ea­ted second-tier Valenci­en­nes 3-0 on...,"PARIS: Alexandre Laca­z­ette scored twice as Olympique Lyonnais def­ea­ted second-tier Valenci­en­nes 3-0 on Tuesday to reach the French Cup final, where they will face either Paris St-Germain or Rennes.
Valenciennes, who are almost certain to be relegated from Ligue 2, had a first-half goal disallowed following a VAR review for a foul in the build-up.
Former Arsenal striker Lacazette won and converted a penalty in the 51st minute and then added a second with a clinical finish on the turn.
Gift Orban replaced Laca­zette and tapped in Lyon’s third with 15 minutes left to seal Lyon’s place in the May 25 final in Lille.
Supporters stormed the pitch at the final whistle to express their joy after a disastrous first half of the season left the seven-time French champions rooted to the foot of the table.
They are now safely in mid-table after a drastic turnaround under Pierre Sage, but the cup appears the club’s only realistic way of qualifying for Eur­ope after missing out in three of the past four seasons.
It will be Lyon’s first appearance in the final since 2012, when they beat third-division Quev­illy to lift the most recent of their five French Cups.

JUVENTUS’ Dusan Vlahovic (R) scores during the Coppa Italia semi-final first leg against Lazio at the Allianz Stadium.—Reuters

 
TURIN: Juventus earned a 2-0 advantage over Lazio in the first leg of their Italian Cup semi-final on Tuesday when forwards Federico Chiesa and Dusan Vlahovic both scored for Massimiliano Allegri’s side in the second half.
The win edged Juventus closer to their 22nd final in the cup, which they have won a record 14 times.
The return leg will be played in Rome on April 23.
Juventus could have opened the scoring early in the game when they were awarded a penalty for Matias Vecino’s foul on defender Andrea Cam­biaso but the referee overturned his decision after a VAR check showed that the Juve right-back was offside.
Lazio, who lost striker Mattia Zaccagni through injury in the 14th minute, looked better in the opening half, pressing for chances while they held more possession.
But the visitors, who on Saturday  edged Juve 1-0  at home in Serie A with a last-gasp goal, struggled for precision and Chiesa eventually gave Juventus the lead five minutes after the break.
The Italy striker profited from a neat vertical pass by Cambiaso to strike from the edge of the box low inside the right post.
The goal sparked Juventus into life and Vlahovic doubled their advantage in the 64th minute, netting into the bottom far corner.
Weston McKennie played Vlahovic in from the right flank with a first touch for the Serbian to break into the box and score his 10th goal across all competitions since the turn of the year.
“It was a really difficult period for all of us, we knew we had to be up to this game,” Vlahovic told Mediaset.
“We played against a very strong team, with a strong coach. We gave everything and after the goal everything became easier.”
Juventus are unbeaten in their last 23 home games in the competition, a record streak for the Bianconeri in the tournament.
Their last home Coppa Italia defeat came in March 2015, a 2-1 loss to Fiorentina with a brace from Mohamed Salah.
Lazio, who have reached the Coppa Italia semi-finals for the first time since 2018-19, ended the game with no shots on target, suffering five consecutive defeats away from home in the competition for the first time.

7,"Tottenham held by West Ham, Everton hit back at Newcastle",LONDON: Tottenham Hotspur missed the chance to move into the Premier League’s top four after a 1-1 draw at West ...,"LONDON: Tottenham Hotspur missed the chance to move into the Premier League’s top four after a 1-1 draw at West Ham United, while Newcastle were also held 1-1 by Everton on Tuesday.
Spurs have made a habit of recovering from slow starts to win in recent months, but this time they failed to capitalise on scoring after just five minutes.
Brennan Johnson was left with the simple task of tapping into an empty net from Timo Werner’s cross.
West Ham were under pressure to respond after collapsing from 3-1 up to lose 4-3 at Newcastle on Saturday.
The Hammers were quickly level as Jarrod Bowen’s corner flew in off the back of Kurt Zouma.
A draw kept West Ham one point ahead of Newcastle in seventh, but they missed the best chance to take all three points when Michail Antonio fired straight at Guglielmo Vicario.
Tottenham close to within two points of Aston Villa in fourth and extend their lead over sixth-placed Manchester United to nine points.
“Disappointed not to get a better outcome, but a tough game,” said Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou.
“There’s a lot of games to go still. I will be very surprised if all games aren’t tight. Everyone is fighting for something. We have to maintain our levels.”
Earlier, injury-hit Newcastle’s hopes of European football next season were dented by Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s late equaliser for Everton from the penalty spot.
Alexander Isak netted for the fifth consecutive game at St James’ Park to open the scoring.
The Swede took his tally for the season to 19 as he cut inside Jarrad Branthwaite and slotted into the far corner on 15 minutes.
“Alexander Isak is an outstanding technician,” said Newcastle manager Eddie Howe.  “He looks like he will score in every game at the moment.”
But Calvert-Lewin ended a near six-month goal drought from the spot after Ashley Young was hauled down inside the box by Paul Dummett.
Everton set a new club record winless run of 13 Premier League games to leave their 70-year stay in the top flight still at risk.
The Toffees edge four points above the relegation zone but have the threat of a second points deduction for breaches of financial rules hanging over them.
Meanwhile, Nottingham Forest pulled three points clear of the relegation zone with a first-half blitz of Fulham to win 3-1.
The home side sped out of the blocks at the City Ground as Callum Hudson-Odoi and Chris Wood smashed home inside the first 19 minutes.
Fulham boss Marco Silva showed his disgust by making a triple substitution after just half an hour.
However, even that did not halt Forest’s momentum as Morgan Gibbs-White made it 3-0 in first-half stoppage time.
“It’s important but it can not distract us because we have a long way to go,” said Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo.
“We’ve had good performances before and not been able to sustain them so let’s take that into this game and try to sustain the performance.”
Fulham pulled one back through Tosin Adarabioyo in the second half but it was too little, too late for the Cottagers.
Elsewhere, second-bottom Burnley are now unbeaten in four but slip six points adrift of safety after a 1-1 draw at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers.
Jacob Bruun Larsen put the Clarets in front, but Rayan Ait-Nouri’s header secured Wolves a point.
Bournemouth climbed above Chelsea into 11th thanks to Justin Kluivert’s winner as they beat Crystal Palace 1-0.

The 1000 tournament has not featured on the WTA circuit since Covid-19 was discovered in the city, which became the location of the first lockdown of the pandemic in January 2020.
Wuhan, home to former Australian Open and French Open champion Li Na, saw the sport’s popularity surge in the last two decades. Australian Open finalist Zheng Qinwen had also relocated there as a child for training.
“We are delighted to announce the return of the WTA 1000 event to Wuhan, and reignite the thrill of elite tennis competition in one of Asia’s most vibrant cities,” Jorge Salkeld, Senior Vice President of organisers Octagon Tennis was reported as saying by Xinhua news agency.
The tournament will be held from Oct 7 to 13 at the Optics Valley Inter­national Tennis Center in Wuhan.

Marlon Ritter put the visitors in front after a costly error by Saarbruecken keeper Tim Schreiber. Ritter’s header from an Almamy Toure cross slipped through the hands and legs of Schreiber as Kaiserslautern led after 53 minutes.
Toure’s header in the 75th minute made sure of a place in the final for second division Kaiserslautern for the first time since 2003.
It also snapped a scintillating run for Saarbruecken, who had eliminated three Bundesliga clubs in the previous three rounds, including Bayern Munich, Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Moenchengladbach.
“That hurts so much,” Saarbruecken coach Ruediger Ziehl told ARD. “We  didn’t have to lose that game. We paid for one mistake.”
The Bundesliga  2 team will face either Xabi Alonso’s unbeaten Bayer Leverkusen or  Fortuna Duesseldorf in the final in Berlin on May 25 as they bid to win  the title for a third time.
The last second-tier club to reach the final was Duisburg 13 years ago, when they lost 5-0 to Schalke.
“We  didn’t allow them to counter against us. That’s how Bayern Munich  failed here, that’s how Borussia Moenchengladbach failed here,” said  Kaiserslautern boss Friedhelm Funkel.

10,Rubiales arrested at airport,MADRID: Spanish police on Wednesday briefly arrested ex-football chief Luis Rubiales in connection with an alleged...,"MADRID: Spanish police on Wednesday briefly arrested ex-football chief Luis Rubiales in connection with an alleged graft scandal at the RFEF football federation when he was president.
The 46-year-old was detained at Madrid’s Barajas airport shortly after flying in from the Dominican Republic but released shortly afterwards, a Guardia Civil police spokesman said.
Sources close to the probe said he disembarked from the plane under a police escort before being questioned inside the airport.
His arrest came two weeks after investigators searched 11 locations, including the RFEF’s Madrid headquarters and Rubiales’ house in the southern city of Granada, as part of a probe into alleged corruption and other crimes.
The March 20 raids were part of  “an investigation linked to presumed crimes linked with corruption in business, fraudulent administration and money laundering”, judicial sources said.
Spanish media reports said investigators were looking into RFEF contracts signed since 2018, including one signed by Rubiales to take the Spanish Super Cup to Saudi Arabia.
The Super Cup contracts are worth 40 million euros a year ($43.3 million) with the deal brokered by Kosmos, a company owned by former Barcelona and Spain defender Gerard Pique.
According to Cadena Ser radio, Guardia Civil police flew to the Dominican Republic and on Monday searched the premises where Rubiales has been staying, seizing a laptop and a mobile phone following an order by the investigating judge.
A day after the March 20 raids, the RFEF sacked its legal director Pedro Gonzalez Segura, head of human resources Jose Javier Jimenez and terminated its contract with GC Legal, the law firm of Tomas Gonzalez Cueto.
All three had been arrested by police during the raids.

11,No ‘specific’ terror threat to Paris Olympics: minister,PARIS: France’s sports minister said on Wednesday that there was no  “specific” terror threat to the Paris...,"PARIS: France’s sports minister said on Wednesday that there was no  “specific” terror threat to the Paris Olympics and that organisers were planning to go ahead with the opening ceremony on the river Seine.
An attack on a Moscow concert hall last month which left 140 people dead has revived fears for the Paris Games which begin on July 26.
“Today there is no specific terror-related threat targeting the Olympic and Paralympic Games,” Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera told the France 2 channel.
She said the opening ceremony on the Seine remained the  “main plan” but suggested that an alternative was being prepared behind the scenes.
Instead of parading through the athletics stadium at the start of the Games, sporting delegations are set to sail down the Seine on a flotilla of river boats in front of up to 500,000 spectators, including people watching from nearby buildings.
“It’s not because we are not talking about a Plan B that there isn’t one,” Oudea-Castera added.
All countries have said they plan to take part in the open-air river parade, including the most risk-averse such as the United States and Israel.
The Olympics have been attacked in the past — most infamously in 1972 in Munich and again in 1996 in Atlanta — with the thousands of athletes, huge crowds and live global television audience making it a target.
Organisers have previously ruled out moving the location of the opening ceremony from the Seine but have suggested it could be downgraded — meaning only performers, and not athletes, might board the boats, for example.
French security forces are screening up to a million people before the Games, including people living close to key infrastructure, according to the interior ministry.
After the Moscow attack, the government placed France on its highest terror alert, meaning security forces are patrolling around possible targets such as government buildings, transport infrastructure or schools.
Oudea-Castera said that rehearsals for the opening ceremony would take place on the river on May 27 and June 17.
Speaking in parliament on Tuesday evening, she denied to lawmakers that the Olympics budget was slipping out of control.
The head of the state auditor, Pierre Moscovici, said last week that the cost to taxpayers could reach 5.0 billion euros — much higher than the three billion he had previously indicated.
“There are no hidden costs or a budgetary drift,” Oudea-Castera said, adding that  “these are the least costly Oly­m­pics since Sydney (in 2000).”
The current budget is 8.8 billion euros, comprising 4.4 billion euros for the organising committee and 4.4 billion for infrastructure.
She told France 2 last week that there was  “no reason” that the state’s contribution to the Games would reach five billion euros.
The budget for the organising committee might over-run by 15 per cent, compared to 200 per cent in London, she said.
“We have a budget that is extremely controlled,” she told France 2.
A 2020 study by academics at the University of Oxford concluded that every summer Olympics since 1960 had gone over budget, with the average sports-related costs ending up between two to three times (172 per cent) the original estimate.
Some of the most notorious over-spends occurred in Montreal in 1976 and Rio de Janiero in 2016, where both cities were left nearly bankrupt and mired in debt.
