1,"Even in protest, PTI to take parliamentary route, says Gohar","Party calls on CJP to step down from full bench hearing ""meddling"" suo motu.","ISLAMABAD: Although the PTI is planning a protest along with its allies in the opposition, the party’s chairman made it clear on Wednesday that rather than being a disruptive force, they would be taking a parliamentary route this time around.
Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said that the PTI was in talks with parties such as the Majlis Wahdat Muslimeen, Mehmood Khan Achakzai’s PkMAP, Jamaat-i-Islami, BNP-Mengal and even Fazlur Rehman’s JUI-F to join their protests, which would now continue after the Eidul Fitr break.
When asked about their strategy for the upcoming wave of protests announced by the party, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan pointed out that the party had not gone for a sit-in, boycott or en masse resignations and were sitting in parliament despite knowing that the government of the day does not enjoy a legitimate mandate.
“It is everyone’s demand that elections should never be rigged. The people vote for someone and someone else comes to power, this shouldn’t happen,” he said, explaining the reasons behind the protest movement.

Party calls on CJP to step down from full bench hearing ‘meddling’ suo motu

When asked if he apprehended any hurdles to their protest plan, Barrister Gohar said that they would carry out “on and off” peaceful protests across the country and would only do so in the designated areas with official permission.
When asked if they would let the incumbent government complete its five-year term, Barrister Gohar said they wished every government should complete its tenure, but the current rulers did not have a public mandate.
CJP’s ‘recusal’
Meanwhile, in a press conference, PTI Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan demanded that Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa should not be part of the bench that deals with the letter written by six high court judges, following his recent meeting with the premier.
Flanked by senior PTI leaders Khalid Khurshid, Shaukat Basra and Kanwal Shauzab, Mr Hasan said the CJP did not have any justification and logic to have meeting with the executive over the issue, since the high court judges wrote the letter to Supreme Judicial Council regarding alleged interference by the executive, indicating that the premier himself was an “accomplice” in the matter.
He alleged that efforts were being made at the SC level to sweep the matter under the rug, as the CJP spent a lot of time during proceedings to explain and justify his meeting with PM Shehbaz Sharif. “We believed that the CJP made the case and his own conduct controversial by holding meeting with PM,” Mr Hasan maintained.
He also expressed concerns that PTI founding chairman Imran Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, was facing life threats and was being slow poisoned.
He said that despite the passage of five weeks, Bushra Bibi had not recovered, rather her health had deteriorated further. He said they demanded that instant orders should be given regarding medical examination of Bushra Bibi and her blood sample should be sent abroad because no such laboratory existed in Pakistan to prepare a blood report of slow poisoning. “We demand that she should be shifted to Adiala Jail immediately,” he said.
Former chief minister of Gilgit-Baltistan Khalid Khurshid also lashed out at the authorities concerned for denying facilities of medical examination to Bushra Bibi despite her fast-deteriorating health condition.

ISLAMABAD: Presi­d­ent Asif Ali Zardari and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir in their first official meeting on Wednesday expressed concern over “baseless and unsubstantiated” allegations levelled by a specific political party and its few individuals against the army for meeting their political designs.
The meeting took place at the Presidency where the COAS called on Presi­dent Zardari and congratulated him on assuming the charge of his office.
An official press release issued by the Presidency said: “The president noted with grave concern the baseless allegations levelled by a specific political party and its few individuals against the institution and its leadership to accrue narrow political interests and resolved to deal with such disruptive elements with an iron hand.”
Mr Zardari paid tribute to the martyrs who had sacrificed their lives for the nation, emphasising that their blood would “forever symbolise the resilience and strength of the Pakistani nation”. He reiterated the nation’s unwavering commitment to honouring the sacrifices of martyrs and their families.

“During the meeting, the COAS apprised the president regarding ongoing operations of the army against terrorism and hi­­gh­­lighted the operational preparedness agai­nst conventional threats. 
“The COAS also intimated about the contributions of the army towards development initiatives, particularly in the regions of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the statement said. 
The president acknowledged the role of the armed forces, affirming that the army’s contributions had been instrumental in safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.
Mr Zardari also commended the army’s efforts towards the social uplift of affected areas, underscoring the unwavering commitment of the army to national progress, the statement said.
“The president emphasised Pakistan’s steadfast commitment against terrorism and reaffirmed the nation’s resolve to respond with full force through all elements of national po­­w­er,” the statement added.
“The meeting concluded on a note of solidarity and determination to uphold the values of peace, security and progress in Pakistan,” the president said.
Trade with Singapore
Later, President Zar­d­ari urged Pakistan’s high commissioner to Singa­p­ore to work for the promotion of bilateral trade and business linkages with Singaporean businesses, besides encouraging them to benefit from Pakistan’s investment-friendly policies.
Talking to newly appo­inted High Commissioner Rabia Shafiq, who called on him, the president highlighted the need to explore opportunities for the export of Pakistani food and agricultural products to Singapore.
“Pakistan can become a steady source of food supplies for Singapore by exporting processed food items, such as poultry, meat, seafood, etc,” he added.
He emphasised the need for exploring avenues to export Pakistani manpower to Singapore and work for the enhancement of bilateral cooperation in the areas of information technology and agriculture.
The president congratulated Ms Shafiq on her appointment as Pakistan’s high commissioner and wished her a productive and professional successful tenure in Singapore.

6,PHC chief justice asks why KP judges ignored for elevation,"Writes four-page letter to CJP Qazi Faez Isa expressing concern over ""non-consideration"".","PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court (PHC) Chief Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan has expressed concern over the “non-consideration” of judges from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for their elevation to the Supreme Court.
A PHC official on Wednesday confirmed that Justice Khan had written to Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa.
In the four-page letter, Justice Khan, who is retiring on April 14, states, “I am writing to your Lordship with a heavy heart and a sense of disillusionment in relation to prima facie arbitrariness, discrimination and favouritism in the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court of Pakistan.”
“There were four vacancies in the Supreme Court but only one vacancy was filled by appointing my brother Honourable Judge Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan of Balochistan High Court, the then Chief Justice Balochistan High Court,” the letter states.
“It was a profound disappointment when I learnt that only one judge and that too from your own province, was appointed in the Supreme Court despite the fact that there were four vacancies. I am genuinely happy for my brother Mr Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan but why my candidacy was not considered notwithstanding my seniority, eligibility and availability of vacancies in the Supreme Court,” he further states.
“I am the second senior-most Chief Justice among the Chief Justices of all High Courts in Pakistan. I am also a member of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and Supreme Judicial Council of Pakistan. I had legitimate expectation that my candidature would be at least included in the list for consideration to be appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan,” he stated, adding that had he not been found fit to be appointed as a judge of the apex court after due process by the JCP he would have happily accepted the JCP’s decision.
Justice Ibrahim Khan writes, “The taxpayers, who pay for our salaries, expect that vacancies are filled immediately so that the court may operate at full strength and dispense justice. There is a duty to act diligently.
“This decision of solitary appointment has left me perplexed and seeking genuine answers. I have been thinking about possible reasons for not filling the vacancies but no logical and persuasive reason could come to mind.”
Justice Khan said he had been faithfully serving for the past 31 years, characterised by steadfast commitment, dedication, and numerous contributions that, in his opinion, not only benefited the community but also upheld the highest standards of the judicial system.
He maintained, “Throughout my service, I have endeavoured to embody the virtues of integrity, impartiality, and a steadfast commitment to justice, principles I believed would naturally pave the way for recognition and career advancement based on merit.
“I appreciate that decisions of appointing judges in the superior courts are complex and multifaceted, involving considerations that may not always be apparent to all. Nevertheless, in the spirit of transparency, the norms of fairness, and the continued trust in our judicial system, I take the honour to question as to what prompted the solitary elevation of my brother Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan when three vacancies were and are still vacant whereas none other was considered,” he questioned.
“It is also mind-boggling that presently, there are three honourable judges in the Supreme Court of Pakistan from Balochistan whereas from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, there are only two honourable judges therefore, while comparing the two provinces on any analogy whatsoever, desirably there would be one more vacancy for the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”
Justice Ibrahim Khan has also sent copies of the letter to the four senior judges of the Supreme Court.
