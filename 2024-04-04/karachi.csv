This came during a meeting of key members of Sindh cabinet led by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah with a team from the World Bank headed by country director Najy Benhassine.

1,Diseases spread in Karachi as gas crisis forces people to use unboiled water,"Around 1,500 gastroenteritis patients reported daily at Civil Hospital.","• Around 1,500 gastroenteritis patients reported daily at CHK
• Experts say water contamination very common in Karachi due to broken pipelines, unhygienic conditions at hydrants
• Bottled water unaffordable for ordinary people
KARACHI: Expressing concern over the persistently high number of gastroenteritis cases in the city, experts said on Wednesday that one key reason behind this situation was use of contaminated water for drinking purposes as a paucity of gas and its soaring prices had forced many people to use water without boiling it.
Water supplies to the city, they pointed out, had been found to be highly contaminated on multiple occasions and needed to be properly boiled or filtered to make it safe for drinking.
Speaking to Dawn, doctors at the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK), where around 1,500 patients daily report at the emergency department, shared that the cases of gastroenteritis had seen a spike in recent days.
“Currently, gastroenteritis constitutes 70 to 80 per cent of our cases being reported at the hospital’s emergency department on a daily basis. There are a few cases of cholera as well,” shared CHK additional medical superintendent Dr Liaquat Ali Halo.
 
 

According to him, patients report with complaints of acute watery diarrhoea and are administered intravenous fluids for rehydration. Most patients are discharged within a few hours while some require admission.
About the reasons behind the increase in gastroenteritis cases, he said lack of chlorination and filtration had been a major factor that contributed to frequent episodes of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the city, besides consumption of contaminated foods from roadsides and poor hand hygiene.
“Many patients tell us that they are forced to use unboiled water for drinking as gas supplies are highly inadequate in their localities and the filtered water has become costlier,” Dr Halo said, adding that inadequate cooking and eating contaminated raw food and vegetables could also cause illnesses.
At the Indus Hospital, a total of 371 patients of gastroenteritis have visited the facility over the last 10 days.
The hospital saw 80 plus admissions from the illness last month.
At the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Dr Yahya Tunio seconded  the opinion about the spike in gastroenteritis cases in recent days.
“We are getting around 200 cases of gastroenteritis daily at the emergency department. A significant number of these patients suffer from mild to severe disease and some of them are admitted for treatment,” he said.
Explaining how people could make water safe for drinking, Dr Yahya said if boiling water wasn’t affordable then people should install three-stage water filters at their homes.
Experts also pointed to the city’s obsolete water distribution system as another cause for contamination.
The masses, they said, were paying high costs on account of water-borne illnesses that could be easily prevented by ensuring provision of clean water at the community level.
Giving his feedback on the city’s public health situation, Dr Altaf Hussain Khatri, senior general physician based in the old city area, said gas shortage amid drastic increase in prices of food and utilities had made survival of poor families extremely challenging.
“The gas shortage has further compounded miseries of the masses and compromised public health,” he said, adding that along with gastroenteritis, patients of respiratory infections were still reporting in high numbers to general physicians.
“They are very effective as they filter sediments and kill pathogens,” he said.

3,Sindh cabinet lifts ban on recruitment in provincial govt departments,Allows appointment of govt schoolteachers through Sukkur IBA.,"KARACHI: The Sindh cabinet on Wednesday lifted a ban it imposed last year in August on recruitment in the provincial government departments.
The then cabinet in its meeting on Aug 11, 2023 had imposed a complete ban on recruitment for the caretaker government. Before that ban, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan had moved the Sindh High Court against the provincial government’s plan to fill thousands of vacancies without completing required formalities and on its request the SHC had granted a stay order on recruitment in government departments from grade 1-15 across the province.
On Wednesday, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, while chairing the cabinet meeting, asked the provincial chief law officer to get vacated the stay order of the SHC against the recruitment.
 
 

Official sources said that the cabinet members told the chief minister that there were thousands of posts of lower grades lying vacant in government departments, saying that the lifting of ban on recruitment would not only improve the working but the youth would get employment opportunities.

Allows appointment of govt schoolteachers through Sukkur IBA

Approving the lifting of the ban with the consent of the cabinet members, the chief minister directed Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar and the advocate general to pursue the case in court and get the stay order issued against the recruitment vacated.
Meanwhile, the at the request of Education Minister Syed Sardar Shah the cabinet allowed the school education department to continue the recruitment process of Prime School Teachers (PST) and Junior Elementary School Teachers (JEST) in accordance with the Teachers Recruitment Policy 2021 through the Institute of Business Administration, Sukkur.
Extension granted
Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal told the cabinet that the health department had appointed doctors, nurses, skilled and supporting staff on a “service rendered basis” for 89 days in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.
Subsequently, on the recommendation of the health department the Covid-19 doctors and nurses were given extensions in their hiring period from time to time up to June 30, 2023.
Acting on SHC’s order, she said, the health department had on March 17, 2023 referred the cases of 824 doctors and 324 staff nurses to the Sindh Public Service Commission (SPSC) to ascertain their suitability.
The minister said that the SPSC had recommended only 260 suitable nurses out of 324 and the results of doctors were still awaited.
The cabinet, on the recommendation of the health department, approved another extension in the contract of 705 doctors and nurses for a further period of one year i.e. from July 2023 to June 2024.
The extension of 374 technical and supporting paramedical staff and 2,957 skilled and supporting human resources from April 1, 2023 to June 2024 was also approved as per the recommendation of the scrutiny committee.
The CM also approved an amount of Rs2.03 billion to pay their salaries during 2023-24.

5,Rehabilitation of displaced families is Sindh govt’s responsibility: SC,"Victims of demolition drive stage protest as 6,900 families still await compensation; construction cost for 80sq-yds plot is Rs3.7m, court told.","KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Sindh government to fulfil its responsibility for rehabilitating over 6,900 families rendered homeless by a demolition drive, which was carried out along with three major drains in the city.
The apex court also asked them to obtain the estimated cost of construction from the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) for building of houses for such displaced families.
Outside the premises of the SC Karachi registry, a large number of the affected people, including women, gathered and staged a protest against the government for failing to rehabilitate them despite the passage of around three years.
 






When a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar took up the matter for hearing, the Sindh chief secretary and advocate general were not in attendance.

Victims of demolition drive stage protest as 6,900 families still await compensation; construction cost for 80sq-yds plot is Rs3.7m, court told

The court expressed resentment over their absence and directed them to immediately appear in court. Thereafter, both the officials appeared and informed the bench about implementation on its earlier orders regarding compensation and rehabilitation of displaced families.
 
 

A lawyer for the displaced families argued that instead of seeking cost of construction from the PEC in line the court order, the provincial government was getting the cost estimates from its own consultants while as per PEC the cost for construction of a house measuring 80 square yards stood around Rs3.7 million.
However, the chief secretary submitted that the houses were built for flood-affected families and the construction cost of a two-room house was Rs300,000.
He submitted that the issue about the cost of construction would be placed before the provincial cabinet.
The bench said that the rehabilitation of these families was the responsibility of the Sindh government and directed it to fulfil the same.
It asked the provincial authorities to get the estimated cost of construction from the PEC and file a report on April 8.
The bench also directed the chief secretary to appear in court on the next hearing.
The provincial authorities in the statement placed before the bench said that in the light of the apex court order passed in December, the provincial cabinet in January had approved the rehabilitation of displaced families including provision of 80 sq-yd plot for each family in Taiser Town, Malir and construction cost as estimated by the consultant capped at Rs1 million.
It further stated that there were 6,932 such families and the total cash compensation for construction was Rs6.9 billion which would be paid to the affected people by the Sindh government.
The statement also maintained that a committee comprising professors of the NED University, renowned architects, representatives of affected families and others would oversee the whole process.
The authorities had sought six-month time from the court for completing the process of transfer of plots and disbursement of cash compensation for construction.
The demolition drive was carried out on the orders of the Supreme Court along with three major nullahs of the city in order to expand the drains.
In 2021 the apex court ordered the provincial and local authorities for compensation and rehabilitation of the affected and displaced families.

6,SHC summons commissioner on plea against exorbitant rates of essential commodities in Ramazan,"Holy month has almost ended, but admin has yet to file any report about price control, says chief justice","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday summoned the Karachi commissioner as he failed to file comments in a petition filed against the sale of various essential commodities on exorbitant rates in the city.
The director general bureau of supply & prices in its comment submitted that the officers were deputed at the behest of commissioner, who further formed committees to carry out price checking and inspecting major markets.
When a two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi took up the matter for hearing on Wednesday, neither anybody turned up on the behalf of commissioner nor filed comments.
The bench expressed serious resentment over the commissioner and directed him to appear in person on April 8. The chief justice remarked that the holy month of Ramazan had almost passed, but the administration had not bothered to file any report about price control.

Holy month has almost ended, but admin has yet to file any report about price control, says chief justice

The DG bureau of supply & prices in his comments submitted that officers had already been deputed at the behest of divisional commissioner for price control and checking.
The reply also maintained that under the relevant laws, the powers of price fixation were with the district controllers and the Sindh government had appointed commissioners, additional commissioners, deputy commissioner and assistant commissioners as district controllers of price and supplies through a notification issued in 2011.
Citing the chief secretary, director general of the bureau of supply & prices, Karachi commissioner, deputy commissioners and others as respondents, a petitioner submitted that the fruits, vegetables and other essential commodities were being sold in the market on much higher prices in violation of official price list issued by the commissioner office during the holy month of Ramazan.
The lawyer for the petitioner contended that despite such contraventions, the respondents had not been taking any action whatsoever against those unscrupulous persons.
The counsel also placed on record the copies of price list and argued that the daily commodities were being sold on exorbitant rates which required penal action. The petitioner also sought directives for respondents to check the prices of such commodities and take necessary legal action.
It is also submitted in the petition that every year with the beginning of the holy month of Ramazan, the prices of essential commodities including fruits, vegetables and pulses as well as edible foods started swelling and rather went beyond the approach of most of the people in the absence of any proper mechanism to enforce official price list.
The petitioner further maintained that the authorities concerned appeared to be helpless instead of dealing such matter with iron hands to compel sellers to sale such commodities at official rates.
After fixing and issuing the prices, he submitted, it was also the responsible of such authorities/respondents to ensure compliance thereto by visiting and raiding such shops and penalising the violators.

11,"Sindh Textbook Board’s failure to supply free books to schoolchildren was deliberate, says SHRC chief",HYDERABAD: Chairman Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) Iqbal Detho said in his suo motu notice of Sindh Textbook...,"HYDERABAD: Chairman Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) Iqbal Detho said in his suo motu notice of Sindh Textbook Board’s (STB) failure to supply free textbooks to many schools across the province that the board deliberately did not provide textbooks to students as per demand of each school of the province in violation of Article 25(A) of the Constitution and relevant provisions of the Sindh Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2013.
He said in a communication addressed to Chief Secretary of Sindh on Wednesday that documentary evidence revealed that the STB failed to give reasonable explanation for its failure to provide free books, and dismissed the board secretary’s pretexts blaming the shortfall of textbooks on inflation and raise in price of dollar, cost of production, printing and transportation etc.
He said the reasons were nothing but lame excuses as the STB should have borne in mind that supply of free textbooks to students was mandatory and its failure to do so would render irreparable and national loss.
He said that as per a newspaper report dated Aug 11, 2023 the STB sources disclosed there was mega corruption in the board’s Jamshoro offices with the result that lower number of textbooks was published and a huge number of students remained deprived of free books thus it led to frustration among students, parents and educators.
He said that by exercising statutory power under Section 4 (i) of the Sindh Protection of Human Rights Act, 2011, the SHRC sent notice to STB Secretary, Jamshoro, for filing written comments and in response he mentioned challenges faced by the STB in the publication and distribution of textbooks.
He said that the STB secretary underlined that drastic devaluation of Pakistani currency against US dollar which sustainably increased price of essential commodities including, electricity, gas, petroleum products, labour charges, expenses of paper, bleach card, printing, binding material and transportation in comparison with previous years had badly affected STB’s performance.
Mr Detho said the commission raised questions if non-supply of free textbooks within stipulated period did not constitute infringement of the Article 25-A of the Constitution and enabling provisions of the Sindh Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2013, and hamper fundamental right of education to children.
The SHRC periodically sent notices to District Education Officer (DEO) of Larkana to seek reports on supply of free textbooks and learnt that the books were not distributed in various schools of Ratodero taluka and other talukas of Larkana district. 
Mr Detho said that during a visit to DEO Primary and Secondary Jacobabad, Ms Safia Brohi, who complained to him about shortfall of free textbooks in the district. The STB secretary failed to appear before the SHRC for filing any rejoinder if he had any but he did not in gross negligence on his part, he said.
Going through material in shape of statements, comments of parties and documents it came to the fore that the STB deliberately did not supply free textbooks to the students as per demand of each of the school of the province of Sindh for which no reasonable explanations had been given. Thus the STB violated fundamental right guaranteed to every child under Article 25(A) of the Constitution and the relevant provisions of the Sindh Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2013, he said.
Mr Detho said the STB’s reasons for shortfall of textbooks due to inflation and raise in the price of dollar, production, printing, transportation etc. were nothing but lame-excuses. 
If the STB were justified it should have borne in mind that supply of free textbooks to students was mandatory and its failure to provide free books would amount to irreparable national loss, he said.
He said the SHRC directed secretary of School Education and Literacy Department to promptly take necessary actions to address shortfall of free textbooks, ensure timely resolution of the problem and that mechanisms were in place to track progress effectively.
