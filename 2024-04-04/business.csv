0,‘Surprise’ hike in six-month T-bill rates despite sharp fall in inflation,Jump in benchmark tenor against expectations of some market dealers.,"• Jump in benchmark tenor against expectations of some market dealers
• Others say rise in the treasury bill cut-off yield ‘has no connection’ with broader interest rate trends
KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) increased the cut-off yields for the benchmark six-month treasury bills by 100 basis points on Wednesday but kept the rates unchanged for other maturities, indicating the future interest rate trend.
The sudden jump in the six-month papers rate was surprising for some market dealers because inflation fell significantly in March, opening the door for an interest rate cut.
The increase in six-month yields has helped almost equalise rates across all tenors.
March inflation reached its lowest point in nearly two years, falling to 20.7 per cent year-on-year. This was the third consecutive monthly decline, bringing the July-March average inflation to 27.22 per cent compared to 27.19 per cent a year ago.
The market expected a decline in the policy rate in March, but over 23pc inflation did not allow the policymakers to bring down the interest rate.
According to the State Bank, the return on six-month Treasury bills increased by 100 bps to 21.39pc from 20.39pc in the previous auction.
The government raised Rs160 billion for the three-month tenor, Rs143bn for six months, and Rs210.6bn for 12 months.
The government raised Rs557.6bn against the target of Rs525bn, while the total bids were Rs994bn.
Market experts said the cut-off yields on treasury bills are higher than the inflation, which does not reflect the actual situation regarding the future interest rate trend.
The rates for three- and 12-month bills were kept unchanged at 21.66pc and 20.89pc, respectively, while the yield for six-month papers increased to 21.39pc.
Experts point to the challenging economic landscape marked by a steadfast 22pc interest rate since June last year, which has significantly stifled economic growth. The State Bank has been anticipating low inflation in the second half of the current fiscal year. Inflation has started falling, but not up to the expectations of the monetary policy architect.
The high borrowing costs have deterred private sector investments, leading to a sharp contraction in GDP growth and a modest economic growth rate of just 1pc in the second quarter, well below the government’s 3pc target.
Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark, however, remains optimistic about the near future, predicting a reduction in the interest rate in the upcoming monetary policy statement. “I believe the interest rate will be reduced in the next monetary policy on April 29,” he said.
Mr Mamsa said the rise in the six-month Treasury bill rate “has no connection” with broader interest rate trends.
“The stars are aligned for aggressive rate cuts. We forecast a 200 bps rate cut in April MPS (monetary policy statement) and another 200 bps rate cut in the June MPS, based on our inflation expectation of 18pc and 17.5pc in April and May and a stable currency position,” he said.

1,Wheat imports bring down flour prices,Retailers continue fleecing consumers.,"KARACHI: Huge wheat imports by the private sector have continued to bring down the prices of various flour varieties, but many retailers are not passing on the relief to consumers.
Millers have lowered the rate of flour no. 2.5 to Rs106 per kg from Rs124 in February. The price of 10kg wheat flour bag has been slashed to Rs1,070 from Rs1,250. Maida (super fine flour) and fine flour now sell at Rs124 and Rs126 per kg against Rs138 and Rs141 per kg.
However, retailers continued to charge Rs145-170 per kg for wheat flour no 2.5, fine, maida, and chakki atta.
Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA), Sindh Zone, Chairman Aamir Abdullah claimed that the private sector had imported around 3.2 million tonnes of wheat from Russia and Ukraine since September 2023. 

Retailers continue fleecing consumers

He added that lower international wheat prices with rupee appreciation have also reduced the landed cost of imported wheat.
He, however, said the government suspended imports from April 1 after the arrival of new crops.  
He said that allowing the private sector to import wheat last year was the best decision of the federal government and shielded the millers from the Sindh government’s blackmailing practices, which have been in vogue for the last three years.
Mr Aamir said efforts were also being made to end the quota system for getting wheat, which would help the flour millers to operate in an open environment.
He said the Sindh government would procure 900,000 tonnes of wheat this year while it procured 0.777m tonnes last year against the target of 1.3m tonnes.
Chaudhry Mohammad Yousuf, former chairman of the PFMA, said there was no hue and cry about a wheat shortage or crisis thanks to the brisk arrival of imported wheat. He said the locally produced wheat, which had recently started arriving in the market, is available at Rs9,500 per 100 kg. The price of imported wheat had plunged to Rs8,900 from Rs10,800 in the open market a few months back.
“Based on the ex-mill price of Rs106 per kg, flour no 2.5 should not sell more than Rs110 per kg in the retail market,” Yousuf said. He said wheat procurement from the growers by the Sindh government had started from March 25 at Rs4,000 per 40 kg.
He said that allowing conditional flour exports made from imported wheat looks a difficult task as further grain imports have been stopped. However, the wheat import rate is now $200-210 per tonne against $280 last year.

2,Local firms withdraw bid for Shell Pakistan,Airlink's chief executive explains the move as a procedural necessity aimed at keeping the regulatory body informed about their investment decisions.,"ISLAMABAD: Local investors have stepped back from their plans to acquire a stake in Shell Pakistan Ltd, following the announcement of a finalised deal between the company’s parent entity and a Saudi Arabian group.
Pakistan Refinery Ltd (PRL) and Air Link Communication Ltd, two of the interested local investors, officially communicated their withdrawal to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday, marking an end to their bid for the energy company.
Muzaffar Paracha, CEO of Air Link, explained the move as a procedural necessity aimed at keeping the regulatory body informed about their investment decisions. “This is a legal requirement to inform the regulator about the intentions to invest or not to invest in any scrip,” Mr Paracha told Dawn.
He revealed that Shell Petroleum Company Ltd (SPCo) and Wafi Energy Company LLC, a notable fuel station operator in Saudi Arabia, have concluded a share purchase agreement for SPCo’s entire holdings in Shell Pakistan Ltd.
“Now, when Shell Pakistan Ltd has shared the development with the stock exchange, the legal requirement was that either we withdraw our intentions to purchase Shell Pakistan’s interests or challenge the deal on any ground, but that would be an irrational move,” Mr Paracha added.
Shell Pakistan operates under the global energy conglomerate Royal Dutch Shell Plc and has been a significant player in the country’s petrochemical sector. The decision to sell its shareholding was publicised in June 2023, with SPCo holding a substantial 77.42 per cent stake in the company as of December 2022.
The transfer of stakes to Wafi Energy is contingent upon several conditions, including a public offer by the Saudi company on the PSX and obtaining necessary approvals, such as clearance from the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP).

3,Energy sector circular debt surges to Rs5.5tr,World Bank wants more actions as tariff hikes not helping contain debt.,"ISLAMABAD: Despite massive repetitive price shocks to consumers and countrywide drive against theft and billing defaults, the World Bank has found power and gas circular debts increasing by an average of Rs135 billion to Rs5.5 trillion (about 5.1pc of GDP) by end-January this year and wants the government to do more to recover true cost of supply.
“The government has engaged in comprehensive power sector reforms to contain the accumulation of circular debt, but more needs to be done”, said the World Bank in its latest update on circular debt. At the same time, the World Bank also noted that energy inflation increased from 40.6pc in the first half of FY23 to 50.6pc in 1HFY24 due to significant increases in domestic energy prices.
Yet, it noted the power sector circular debt growing by a monthly average of Rs66.14bn to cross Rs2.635tr (2.4pc of GDP) as of Jan 31 from Rs2.172tr by end-June 2023.
Likewise, the gas sector circular debt has risen by an average Rs68bn per month to Rs2.866tr or 2.7pc of GDP by end-January from Rs2.391tr in June 2023, according to the World Bank based on official data. It has called upon the government to “continue electricity and gas sector tariff reform to align tariffs with the cost of supply to constrain mounting gas and electricity sector circular debt”.

World Bank wants more actions as tariff hikes not helping contain debt

Structural issues, poor planning, and substantial subsidies have resulted in huge inefficiencies across the power sector, affecting supply reliability and generating huge deficits. “Pakistan has the highest subsidies on energy products in South Asia”—about 0.9pc of GDP (Rs976bn), two-thirds of which were for electricity consumption.
The bank noted that while the gap has been recently reduced, the notified tariff remains below the cost recovery level. Around 62pc of residential and all agriculture consumers remain subsidised (this rate declined from 92pc in 2021). While the progressivity of subsidies to residential consumers has improved with recent tariff notifications (July 2022 and July 2023), the subsidy to electric tube wells continues to be regressive, benefiting primarily large and wealthy farmers.
Due to the absence of cost-reflective tariffs, together with operational and technical inefficiencies within the state-owned electricity distribution companies (Discos), revenue collection does not fully cover the cost of electricity supply, which leads to accumulating circular debt.
“Inefficiencies in the Discos include outdated metering practices, low collection rates, high technical losses, and rampant theft. While the pace of accumulation has slowed since FY23, the power sector circular debt has continued to grow”, it said, adding the significant accumulations began in 2018 with the signing of “take-or-pay” contracts for large, imported coal and imported gas power plants which increased capacity payments by 50pc and increased the country’s exposure to international fossil fuel price volatility.
As if that was not enough, gas circular debt stood at Rs2.866tr by the end of January compared to Rs2.391tr in June 2023. While consecutive gas tariff increases have contributed to containing growth, the accumulation is a result of delays in tariff adjustment (three years of no tariff increase), inefficiencies in the sector (i.e. unaccounted for gas); and increasing diversion of expensive RLNG to domestic consumers during winter months.
The bank appreciated “timely tariff increases in the last two years, coupled with subsidy rationalisation reforms” and pressed the government to maintain its commitment to comprehensive sector reforms, including a transition away from fossil fuels.
“This requires addressing inefficiencies within Disco by concessioning to the private sector, reducing the cost of generation and overdependence on imported fossil fuels through increasing the share of renewable energy, bringing end-consumer tariffs closer to the cost recovery level, improving supply-side efficiency and collections while strengthening regulatory capacity”, it advised.
The World Bank also noted Pakistan’s large untapped hydro, solar and wind power potential, but said large variations in seasonal peak demand create challenges for deployment of renewable energy, which requires simultaneous expansion and strengthening of the transmission grid.

4,Cotton production increases 71pc,The PCGA said cotton production in Punjab was 4.282m bales while in Sindh it was 4.115m bales.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) on Wednesday reported that the country produced 8.397 million bales in 2023-24, a 71 per cent increase over the preceding year.
However, the output fell short by a record 3.873m bales or 32pc against the target fixed for the year.
The PCGA said cotton production in Punjab was 4.282m bales while in Sindh it was 4.115m bales. District-wise, the highest cotton production has been reported from Sanghar (Sindh), which is 1.695m bales, while the lowest output was 5,240 bales in the Pakpattan district of Punjab.
Of the total output, according to the report, textile mills bought 8.043m bales from ginning factories, while exporters bought 2.93m bales and 60,500 bales are still available with the ginning factories.
Cotton Ginners Forum chairman Ihsanul Haq says that cotton production in Sindh is surprisingly 114,000 bales more than the target. At the same time, production in Punjab has decreased extraordinarily, mainly due to adverse weather conditions and whitefly cotton. “It has been an unusual attack on the crop.”
He says that due to heavy taxes imposed on the ginning and textile industry, some factories and textile mills across the country did “off-the-record” trade in cotton during the year. He claims that the volume of this “off-the-record” trade amounts to at least two million bales, which is why the total domestic production of cotton is considered to be around 10.5 million bales.

5,Exports to ME up 36pc,The trade imbalance with the region has shrunk since the start of the current fiscal year due to lower use of petroleum goods.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s trade deficit with the Middle East narrowed 22.62 per cent to $8.525 billion in the first eight months of the current fiscal year from $11.017bn in the corresponding period of last year mainly due to reduced imports of petroleum products from the region.
The trade imbalance with the region has shrunk since the start of the current fiscal year due to lower use of petroleum goods as prices have steadily increased.
In absolute terms, Pakistan’s expo­rts to the Middle East rose 35.75pc to $2.024bn between July and February 2023-24, compared to $1.491 bn in the corresponding period last year.
At the same time, imports dipped 15.66pc to $10.549bn in 8MFY24 against $12.508bn in the same period last year, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
Pakistan has recently signed a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooper­ation Council (GCC) states to minimise its trade imbalance with the region.
A surge in demand for Pakistani products was observed from countries like the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
Pakistan witnessed a 7.24pc decl­ine in imports totalling $17.488bn in FY23, down from $18.853bn in the preceding year. In FY23, exports to the Middle East shrank 12.62pc to $2.332bn from $2.669bn in the preceding year.
Exports to Saudi Arabia rose 47.3pc in 8MFY24 to $442.82m from $300.62m in 8MFY23. At the same time, imports from Saudi Arabia also increased by 37.16pc to $3.078bn in 8MFY24 against $2.244bn in the same period last year.
Exports to the UAE surged 41.33pc to $1.336bn in 8MFY24 from $945.27m in 8MFY23, primarily due to a significant rise in exports to Dubai. The majority of these exports were directed towards Dubai, amounting to $1.102bn this year, compared to $856.52m during the same period last year, indicating an increase of 28.66pc.
