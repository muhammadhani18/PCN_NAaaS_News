1,HEC to approach CMs for early appointment of VCs in public varsities,"Over 50 universities being run without regular VCs, chairman says.","ISLAMABAD: The Higher Education Commission (HEC) has decided to approach all newly-appointed chief ministers to ensure that the process of appointing vice chancellors (VCs) in public-sector universities is completed well on time.
At present, out of a total of 147 public-sector universities, 60 were functioning without VCs, and this matter also reached the Supreme Court recently.
“We have decided to write to all chief ministers and chancellor offices for early appointment of VCs,” HEC Chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmed said.
Speaking to Dawn on Wednesday, Mr Ahmed said during the tenure of interim governments, the HEC had also written letters to provincial governments.

Over 50 universities being run without regular VCs, chairman says

“This is a serious issue; over 50 universities are being operated without regular VCs,” he said, adding that as per his information, the process of appointment of VCs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) was almost finalised and a summary had been moved to Chief Minister’s Office.
Similarly, he said the appointment of VCs in other provinces was also at an advance stage, explaining that as per rules and regulations, the head of provincial charted universities were appointed by provincial authorities.
Recently, All Public Universities BPS Teachers Association (APUBTA), through its president Dr Samiur Rahman, filed a petition in the Supreme Court.
In response to the said petition, the apex court on April 1 issued notices to respondents and decided to fix the matter in the second week of May.
The order said the counsel for all public-sector university teachers informed the court that this body of teachers represented about 50,000 educationists working in public-sector universities.
According to the order, the counsel states that the association’s only reason for bringing this matter to the attention of the court is to ensure that federal and provincial laws as well as statutes of public-sector universities are implemented.
The order further stated that the lawyer detailed three major grievances of the petitioner. Firstly, out of the 147 public-sector universities, about 60 were functioning without vice chancellors. Secondly, the tenured positions in public-sector universities were not filled and lastly, decision making bodies of public-sector universities, including their boards of governors, syndicates, senates and academic councils, did not hold meetings as frequently as stipulated in law or their respective statutes.Consequently, public-sector universities were under performing, and this impinged on their academic freedom.
The order said the counsel further submitted that the public-sector universities, as envisaged in the law, were supposed to be autonomous but when the said positions were not filled and meetings did not take place, it led to outside interference.
“Issue notice to the respondents, except respondent No 2. The said respondents should submit their comments with regard to the public-sector universities within their respective jurisdictions, including identifying the public-sector universities where the positions of VCs and other tenured positions are lying vacant or such positions are held on acting charge basis and since when. The comments should also disclose the statutory requirements regarding the periodic holding of meetings stipulated therein and whether the universities are complaint therewith. To be fixed in the second week of May, 2024,” the order read.
Earlier, the petition, moved through Advocate Umer Ijaz Gillani, highlighted that 24 out of 34 public-universities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 32 out of 50 in Punjab, six in Sindh and two in Balochistan did not currently have VCs as required under law.
The APUBTA said the non-appointment of legally tenured vice-chancellors adversely affected the administrative structure of public-sector universities because vice chancellors played a key role in all major decision-making bodies of the universities.
It said that not only was this a blatant violation of various statutes, it was also eroding academic freedom within the universities and therefore connected with the enforcement of fundamental rights of the people of Pakistan, it said.
Moreover, the association said ad-hocism created by the non-appointment of vice chancellors was seeping through the entire university structure, the APUBTA regretted, adding that not only were universities operating without VCs but most other significant tenure-based positions — such as directors, deans and chairpersons — of different departments and academies within the universities have lost their sanctity of tenure.
The petitioner feared that widespread pattern of non-appointment or delay in the appointment of university VCs is leading to a collapse of good governance in higher education, adding that the tendency also amounts to violation of the dictum of the Supreme Court’s judgements.

4,Bill proposing ‘Gandhara Corridor’ submitted to NA Secretariat,ISLAMABAD: A private member bill was submitted to the National Assembly Secretariat seeking to establish the...,"ISLAMABAD: A private member bill was submitted to the National Assembly Secretariat seeking to establish the ‘Gandhara Corridor’ to link Pakistan with the Buddhist-majority countries in the region.
The bill was introduced by Hindu lawmaker Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani and its draft was submitted to the secretary of the National Assembly Secretariat under Rule 118 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly 2007.
“This act aims to encourage uniformity of approach among all branches of government and stakeholders for transforming Pakistan into a most favourite pilgrimage destination and an international hub of Gandhara tourism,” the proposed bill stated.
It also calls for establishing a high-level statuary body to ensure that due facilitation support at the federal level must be provided to provinces and administrative units for pursuing a “common national cause of promoting international pilgrimage/faith tourism through a systematic promotion of the Gandhara region”.
According to the bill, the corridor will be headed by the chairperson to be appointed by the prime minister, whereas the head office of the corridor shall be in Islamabad. However, it may set up sub-offices or representative offices at other places in Pakistan as it may deem appropriate.
Dr Ramesh Vankwani, in the statement of objects and reasons, took the stance that under Article 40 of the Constitution, the state shall foster goodwill and friendly relations among all nations as well as support the common interests of the peoples, including of Asia.
“Establishing the Gandhara Corridor would be a game changer…for connecting Pakistan with the Buddhist world,” he stated, stressing that the systematic arrival of international pilgrims would promote the economy and strengthen diplomatic ties with Asian countries.
According to Dr Vankwani, the 2,500-year ancient Gandhara civilization, belonging to the northern part of present-day Pakistan, reflects Buddhism’s glorious past in our region. “Today, over 7% of the world population (approximately 520 million people) is composed of Buddhists. Several Pakistan-friendly Asian countries including Japan, Koreas, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Bhutan, Laos, and Mongolia are having large Buddhist populations,” he expressed.
“The Gandhara Corridor may in the performance of its functions seek assistance or facilitation of any office, authority or agency working under the federal government, a provincial government or a local government or of a representative designated by the provinces and territories. In this regard, provinces and territories may appoint a representative/focal person to provide liaison and assist the corridor in performance of its functions under this act,” the bill stated.
Gandhara Corridor aims to conduct research and analysis, enhance capacity, develop policy, and strategies, advise various branches of the government, foreign missions, academia, and professionals, facilitate the private sector, mobilise media, cultivate awareness and responsibility and help build capacity as individuals, establish partnerships with stakeholders and collaborations with national and international organisations for promoting Gandhara historical sites. It will also attract international pilgrims, including Buddhists, Hindus and Jains, belonging to various countries in the best interest of Pakistan.

5,Pindigheb police officials face departmental inquiry over ‘fake’ FIRs,"Inquiry holds Pindigheb DSP, SHO responsible for falsely implicating three brothers in drug cases","RAWALPINDI: In a top-level investigation, the Regional Investigation Branch (RIB) has found out that the deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and the Pindigheb SHO had falsely implicated three brothers of a slain man in drugs-related cases allegedly to pressure them into dropping the murder charges against the suspects involved in the murder.
Muhammad Rafiq’s brother Safar Khan was murdered in April 2023 and a case against the suspects was registered at the Attock City police station.
“We lost our brother [one year ago] and now we have been avoiding coming out of our houses because of the police which have made it impossible for our entire family to live. One of our brothers – Mohammad Zeeshan has obtained a pre-arrest bail to avoid the police,” Muhammad Rafiq told Dawn.
After failing to get justice from the local police, Muhammad Rafiq approached former regional police officer (RPO) Syed Khurram Ali. Following his complaint, the former RPO assigned the inquiry to Rawalpindi RIB AIG Arif Shahbaz Khan.

Inquiry holds Pindigheb DSP, SHO responsible for falsely implicating three brothers in drug cases

The inquiry, containing the statements of the DSP, the SHO, and Muhammad Rafiq, a resident of Aminabad Attock, has found that none of the three brothers was involved in drug cases and recommended a regular departmental inquiry against the SHO and DSP/SDPO of Pindigheb because the charges levelled against them were of serious nature.
Muhammad Rafiq said in his complaint to former RPO that on April 28, 2023, Hamad and Tariq along with others shot his brother dead over a dispute and a case was registered against the killing. Hamad was arrested on June 18, 2023. Tariq, however, had been declared a proclaimed offender.
‘Pressure’ to drop charges
The brothers were allegedly asked to reconcile but upon refusal, they were booked in multiple cases. On November 17, 2023, Mohammad Shafiq was booked by the Attock City police, and on November 18, Mr Rafiq was also booked at the same police station. The police picked up their brother Zeeshan and booked him in a drugs case at Attock’s Basal police station in December last year.
The registration of cases against them on drug charges had made it impossible for them to pursue the murder case against the suspects who gunned down their brother Safar Khan.
At that time, RPO Rawalpindi Syed Khurram instructed the Regional Investigation Branch to conduct a high-level inquiry and submit a report.
According to the sources, the inquiry team after summoning the investigation officers, including the complainant along with the records. After reviewing all the records, the statements of the officers and personnel were recorded.
During the inquiry, the then SHO Sajjad Haider referred to ‘a voice call recording’ and took the position that his subordinate staff was threatened by the accused. But when the inquiry officer inquired about the legal action taken on these threats, SHO Sajjad Haider gave no response. The SHO could not present any evidence in connection with his claim.
In the report sent to the RPO Rawalpindi, the inquiry team expressed serious reservations. It said the cases filed against the plaintiff and his brothers for drug offences at different times “raised several questions and were themselves a big question mark”.
Similarly, when the SHO takes the position that the applicant threatened his subordinate staff, instead of taking legal action against him, the mysterious silence of the SHO also points to the truth of the position of the affected applicant.
According to the inquiry, there was no record of involvement in any drug-related case against the three brothers, but by implicating them in different cases, it appeared that the police officers and staff were biased. It further said that there “are very serious allegations against the DSP and the SHO, so a regular departmental inquiry should be conducted against them so that the demands of justice could be met”.
When contacted, Muhammad Rafiq told Dawn that all “brothers work hard and the accused have influenced the police. The police used to call us to the police station and harass us. Now his brothers are trying to get bail from the court to avoid the police”.
Newly posted RPO Babar Sarfraz Alpa was contacted, but neither the RPO nor the official spokesperson gave a response in this regard. However, the spokesperson said that the inquiry report had been sent to the DPO Attock for further proceedings.

8,"Nearly 10 million devices worldwide fell victim to data theft in 2023, claims report","443,000 websites worldwide have experienced compromised credentials in the past five years.","ISLAMABAD: Kaspersky Digital Footprint Intelligence has claimed that nearly 10 million devices fell victim to data-stealing worldwide in 2023.
According to Kaspersky’s data, 443,000 websites worldwide have experienced compromised credentials in the past five years. The .com domain leads to compromised accounts; nearly 326 million logins and passwords for websites on this domain were compromised in 2023. While the compromised accounts of .pk domain in Pakistan reached 2.4 million.
According to a statement, the latest reports on data stealing show a 643 percent increase over the past three years.
“The actual number of infections is likely to be even higher than 10 million. According to Kaspersky’s assessment of info-stealer log-file dynamics, the number of infections that occurred in 2023 is projected to reach roughly 16,000,000,” it stated.
With cybercriminals pilfering an average of 50.9 login credentials per infected device, the threat posed by data-stealers is growing for both consumers and businesses. In light of this growing threat, Kaspersky has launched a dedicated web page to raise awareness of the issue and provide strategies for mitigating associated risks.
Threat actors either utilise these credentials for their own purposes, including perpetrating cyberattacks, or sell or distribute them freely on dark web forums and shadow Telegram channels. 
These credentials may encompass logins for social media, online banking services, crypto wallets, and various corporate online services, such as email and internal systems.
“The dark-web value of log files with login credentials varies depending on the data’s appeal and the way it’s sold there. Credentials may be sold through a subscription service with regular uploads, a so-called ‘aggregator’ for specific requests, or via a’shop’ selling recently acquired login credentials exclusively to selected buyers.
Prices typically begin at $10 per log file in these shops. This highlights how crucial it is for both individuals and companies—especially those handling large online user communities—to stay alert. 
Leaked credentials carry a major threat, enabling cybercriminals to execute various attacks such as unauthorised access for theft, social engineering, or impersonation,” says Hafeez Rahman, technical group manager at Kaspersky.
To guard against data theft, individuals have been advised to use a comprehensive security solution for any device.

The matter was discussed during a meeting between the VEC and Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC) in Islamabad.
PARC ChairmanDr Ghulam Mohammad Ali appreciated the role of private and public sector for taking interest in research and development of rice in the country.
He emphasised the importance of quality seed for enhancing the productivity and profitability of farmers and appreciated the role of research institutes and seed companies for making quality seeds availabile to rice farmers in Pakistan.
Dr. Muhammad Yousuf, National Coordinator (Rice) of PARC, presented the committee members with an overview of 38 proposals for rice hybrids and varieties.
The meeting was attended by representatives from the Ministry of National Food Security and Research, Federal Seed Certification, national and multinational seed companies as well as rice scientists from provincial and federal research institutes.
After extensive discussions, the VEC recommended eight high-yielding rice hybrids of private seed companies for cultivation in Pakistan.

11,Probe sought into purchase of buses by AJK higher education dept,MUZAFFARABAD: A close aide of former AJK prime minister and senior PML-N leader Raja Farooq Haider has reiterated ...,"MUZAFFARABAD: A close aide of former AJK prime minister and senior PML-N leader Raja Farooq Haider has reiterated his demand to the anti-corruption department to initiate a transparent inquiry into the alleged dubious purchase of 27 buses by the higher education department nearly four years ago.
In a letter written to the director general (DG) anti-corruption on Wednesday, the aide Zahid Amin, a prominent political and social activist, recalled that he had initially made a request for the inquiry on October 22, 2020 when he was holding the office of the chairman Prime Minister’s Inspection and Implementation Commission (PMIIC) in Mr Haider led PML-N government.
In June 2020, the AJK higher education department had reportedly purchased 27 buses of Isuzu company [for colleges etc] amid apprehensions expressed by the PMIIC over the transparency of the procurement process.
Some letters made available to Dawn revealed that the PMIIC had earlier directly corresponded with the higher education secretariat to ensure ingenuousness in the procurement process. However, when the department paid no heed to its several letters and went ahead with the purchase, Mr Amin, the then PMIIC chief, directly wrote to the DG anti-corruption department to dig deep into the complaints of non-transparency in the procurement.
According to Mr Amin’s letter of October 22, 2020, a copy of which was also made available to Dawn, the anti-corruption department was asked in particular to look into four points - whether the PPRA Rules had been followed for procurement or not; whether the inclusion of certain specifications of buses in the PC-1 was aimed at favouring any particular automobile company; why Mitsubishi company was ignored despite better quality and low price of its buses; why the higher education department was adamant to make procurement from Isuzu when three different reports from the AJK government’s mechanical division had pointed out defects in their vehicles?
In the same letter, Mr Amin had urged the anti-corruption department to keep his office informed about the progress of the inquiry in the light of the points raised by it.
However, according to Mr Amin, the inquiry could not be held because only a few months later the general elections related activities and engagements had overshadowed most of such issues.
In his fresh letter to the DG anti-corruption department, Mr Amin alleged that the ‘questionable’ procurement of buses was made by the higher education department under the pressure of its then minister Waqar Ahmed Noor in blatant disregard to the concerns towards which he had drawn attention in his four years old letter.
Interestingly, Mr Noor, who was re-elected in July 2021 on the PML-N ticket, is part of the present Chaudhry Anwarul Haq led coalition government as the most powerful senior minister.
Lately, Mr Noor had earned the ire of the PML-N workers for his comments at a press conference he had addressed along with some six other cabinet members, representing all three coalition partners, to counter the criticism of PM Haq by Mr Haider.
Though Mr Noor had not directly named Mr Haider, his comments were however visibly directed at the latter, who has been repeatedly calling for PML-N’s exit from the coalition government.
Mr Amin told Dawn that until the July 2021 elections he verbally reminded the anti-corruption department on many occasions to initiate action on his letter, but to no avail.
“As a member of the civil society, I have now formally written to the anti-corruption department to hold the much needed thorough and transparent inquiry into this matter without further loss of time,” he said.
