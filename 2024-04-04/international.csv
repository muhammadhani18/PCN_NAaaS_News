0,Turkiye’s poll body reverses pro-Kurd mayor’s ineligibility,The Supreme Election Board said that the move was “a result of the resistance of the Kurdish people”.,"ISTANBUL: Turkiye’s pro-Kurdish party on Wednesday said the country’s election authority had reinstated a mayoral election winner in the eastern city of Van, after clashes over the annulment of his victory. The DEM party’s Abdullah Zeydan garnered more than 55 per cent of the vote in Van in local elections on Sunday.
But the regional electoral commission claimed he was ineligible to stand due to a previous conviction and instead handed city hall to a candidate from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), who managed only 27pc.
However, the Supreme Election Board (YSK) has since  “decided to give the certificate of election to our Van... mayor Abdullah Zeydan,” DEM wrote on X, formerly Twitter. It added that the move was  “a result of the resistance of the Kurdish people”.
The regional commission’s ineligibility decision followed the last-minute reversal of a court verdict that had restored Zeydan’s right to stand for office. Zeydan, who was elected as an MP on the HDP (now DEM) ticket in 2015, was arrested and jailed in 2016 after criticising the Turkish army’s air campaign against outlawed Kurdish militants in the Kurdish-majority southeast. He was released in 2022.
Violent protests against his ouster lasted through the night in Van province, which lies on Turkiye’s eastern border with Iran. The local governor’s office banned all demonstrations for two weeks after violent scuffles spread to several cities in the region, with some protesters setting police barricades on fire.
Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 89 people were detained, 26 of them in Van province, for joining unauthorised rallies and chanting slogans in praise of a  “separatist terror organisation”, referring to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) that has been blacklisted by Turkiye and its Western allies.

1,US directs Nasa to create lunar time standard,NASA to formulate a plan by the end of 2026.,"WASHINGTON: The White House announced on Tuesday it is directing Nasa to create a unified time standard for the Moon and other celestial bodies, as governments and private companies increasingly compete in space.
With the United States keen to set international norms beyond Earth’s orbit, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) instructed the US space agency to formulate a plan by the end of 2026 for a standard it is calling Coordinated Lunar Time.
“As Nasa, private companies, and space agencies around the world launch missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond, it’s important that we establish celestial time standards for safety and accuracy,” OSTP Deputy Director for National Security Steve Welby said in a statement.
He noted how  “time passes differently” depending on positions in space, offering the example of how time appears to pass more slowly where gravity is stronger, such as near celestial bodies.
“A consistent definition of time among operators in space is critical to successful space situational awareness capabilities, navigation, and communications,” Welby said.
The aim, the White House says, is for Coordinate Lunar Time, or LTC, to be tied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), currently the primary time standard used throughout the world to regulate time on Earth.
The White House directed Nasa to work with the Departments of Commerce, Defence, State and Transportation to deliver a time standard strategy that will improve navigation and other operations for missions in particular in cislunar space, the region between Earth and the Moon.

Ministers said such a fund would not be easy to put together. Ukraine said  it would be welcome, but needed to be fresh money.
“We need to shift the dynamics of our support,” Stoltenberg said.  “We must ensure reliable and predictable security assistance to Ukraine for the long haul ... less on short-term offers and more on multi-year pledges.”  Stoltenberg’s proposal would also give the Western alliance a more direct role in coordinating the supply of arms, ammunition and equipment to Ukraine as it fights Russia’s invasion.
Under the plans, Nato would take over some coordination work from a US-led ad-hoc coalition known as the Ramstein group — a move designed in part to guard against any cut in US support if Donald Trump returns to the White House, diplomats said.
Stoltenberg said the aim was for a decision to be taken at a July summit of Nato member states’ leaders. Nato decisions require consensus among its 32 members.

3,"Trump calls migrants ‘animals’, intensifying focus on immigration",Researchers say migrants do not commit more violent crimes than native-born citizens.,"GREEN BAY (Wisconsin): Donald Trump called immigrants illegally in the United States  “animals” and  “not human” in a speech in Michigan on Tuesday, resorting to the degrading rhetoric he has employed time and again on the campaign trail.
The Republican presidential candidate, appearing with several law enforcement officers, described in detail several criminal cases involving suspects in the country illegally and warned that violence and chaos would consume America if he did not win the Nov 5 election.
In a later speech in Green Bay, Wisconsin, he struck a similarly foreboding tone, describing the 2024 election as the nation’s  “final battle.”  While speaking of Laken Riley — a 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia allegedly murdered by a Venezuelan immigrant in the country illegally — Trump said some immigrants were sub-human.
“The Democrats say, ‘Please don’t call them animals. They’re humans.’ I said, ‘No, they’re not humans, they’re not humans, they’re animals,’” said Trump, president from 2017 to 2021.

Researchers say migrants do not commit more violent crimes than native-born citizens

In Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump described meeting the family of Ruby Garcia, a local 25-year-old murdered last month by a suspect in the country illegally, according to police. Garcia’s sister denied the former president spoke with the family, according to local media reports.
In stump speeches, Trump frequently claims that immigrants crossing the border with Mexico illegally have escaped from prisons and asylums in their home countries and are fueling violent crime in the United States.
While available data on criminals’ immigration status is sparse, researchers say people living in the US illegally do not commit violent crimes at a higher rate than native-born citizens.
Democratic President Joe Biden, Trump’s rival in the November presidential election, accuses Trump of encouraging Republicans in Congress not to pass legislation this year that would have beefed up security at the southern border and introduced measures aimed at reducing illegal immigration.
“Donald Trump is engaging in extreme rhetoric that promotes division, hate and violence in our country,” Michael Tyler, Biden campaign communications director, told reporters on Tuesday ahead of Trump’s speeches.
Trump titled his Michigan speech  “Biden’s border bloodbath,” and said he met family members of Garcia, who was allegedly murdered last month in her car by Brandon Ortiz-Vite, 25, whom she was dating.
“They said she had just this most contagious laughter, and when she walked into a room, she lit up that room, and I’ve heard that from so many people. I spoke to some of her family,” Trump said. Mavi Garcia, Ruby Garcia’s sister, disputed that account, according to local television stations.

The 63-year-old priest Nuumo Borketey Laweh Tsuru XXXIII, also known as Gborbu Wulomo, married the girl in a ceremony on Saturday near the capital Accra.
Her age is in dispute between 12 to 16, but she and her mother were placed under police protection soon after the marriage and Ghana’s attorney general opened an investigation.
“The allegations, if proven, constitute a criminal offence for which all persons involved must face prosecution,” a statement from the attorney general’s office said.
Under Ghanaian law, the legal minimum age for marriage is 18. Police and officials initially said the girl was 12 or 13, but the traditional authorities involved say she is 16.
“We seem to be unravelling some few things. For instance, the age of 12, which we were made to believe is incorrect. The child is almost 16... still a minor,” Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs Minister Stephen Asamoah Boateng told a local radio station.“It’s not a marriage ceremony. 
There is nothing sexual attached to it. The priest has three customary wives already. It’s a customary role to help the priest with his spiritual duties,” priest’s spokesperson Mankralo Shwonotalor said.

5,"From polar bears to groundwater, nature is riddled with ‘forever chemicals’",PARIS: They didn’t exist a century ago but today PFAS  “forever chemicals” contaminate the environment from...,"PARIS: They didn’t exist a century ago but today PFAS  “forever chemicals” contaminate the environment from groun­dwater to Antarctic snow to turtle eggs, and concern over their possible toxicity is growing.
Lawsuits and regulations targeting per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are multiplying, with France becoming the latest jurisdiction to consider tough new curbs on these long-life substances.
On Thursday, a French legislator will introduce a bill to address what he calls the health  “emergency” posed by exposure to PFAS in the environment. Widely used in everyday items, highly durable, and very slow to break down, PFAS have been detected in water, air, fish and soil in the remotest corners of the globe.
“No ecosystem has escaped,” said Yann Aminot, a specialist in environmental contamination at the French Research Institute for Ocean Science (IFREMER).
He spent six years examining tuna from the Indian and Pacific Oceans, dolphin livers from the Bay of Biscay, and samples from French oyster farms. “I don’t think I have ever seen a single sample free of perfluorinated contaminants,” the researcher said.
Marine contamination
These molecules — the best known of which gave birth to non-stick Teflon — were developed after World War II to give packaging, paints and coatings exceptional resistance to water or heat.
This very quality turned out to be a particular problem for oceans, said Aminot.
“Being persistent compounds — which do not degrade and are mobile — they end up in the marine environment, which always ultimately is the receptacle for contamination,” he said.
A study published in January by the American Chemical Society, a nonprofit scientific organisation, said that PFAS had been detected in the Arctic Ocean at a depth of 3,000 feet (914 metres).
IFREMER recently examined the diets of two fish — sea bass and sole — in the Seine estuary of France and discovered PFAS riddled throughout the food chain.
From the tiny zooplankton eaten by shellfish, which are consumed by smaller fish and ultimately larger predators, PFAS lurked at every step along the way.
A 2022 study in Australia established the transmission of PFAS from female turtles to their unborn offspring, while other research found traces in polar bear livers and birds, seals and other animals.
A wealth of scientific research has demonstrated the pervasive reach of PFAS in nature, but possible harms to people and the planet have been harder to definitively establish. More than 20 years ago, a study in the US concluded that once inside the body PFAS may be able to reach the brain of vertebrates and affect the nervous system.
Chemical cocktail
Studies have since shown that exposure to some PFAS — there are at least 4,000 chemical compounds in the family — may be linked to serious health effects in humans and animals.
It is a subject of growing concern, with French ecologist and MP Nicolas Thierry asking lawmakers to ban PFAS from 2025 if alternatives exist. The European Union is considering a blanket Europe-wide ban on PFAS from as early as 2026 while New Zealand will outlaw their use in cosmetic products by 2027.

6,S. Korean fans bid farewell to internet-famous panda,Beijing has long used “panda diplomacy” as a form of soft power.,"SEOUL: Thousands of well-wishers gathered on Wednesday to bid farewell to the first giant panda born in South Korea, Fu Bao, who left for China in a high-tech non-vibrating vehicle typically used for transporting semi-conductors.
Beijing has long used  “panda diplomacy” as a form of soft power, and Fu Bao’s parents — Ai Bao and Le Bao — were gifted to South Korea in 2016 by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Fu Bao — which means  “treasure that gives happiness” — was born in 2020 and is a celebrity in South Korea, with her videos on the zoo’s YouTube channel attracting around 500 million views.
The Everland amusement park, where Fu Bao lived, says approximately 5.5 million people — around one-tenth of the entire South Korean population — have visited the park to see her.
Thanks to her popularity, the number of visitors to Everland’s Panda World doubled last year to 2.15 million, compared to 1.07 million in 2020 before Fu Bao’s arrival, the theme park said.
Fu Bao welcomed her younger twin sisters last year, named Rui Bao and Hui Bao, whose births also triggered an outpouring of excitement online in South Korea.
Beijing only loans pandas to foreign zoos, which must usually return any offspring within a few years of their birth to join the country’s breeding programme.
Under an agreement between Seoul and Beijing, Fu Bao’s parents can stay in South Korea until 2031, but her twin sisters, like Fu Bao herself, must return to China before they turn four years old. “Fu Bao left Everland at around 11 am,” the zoo said in a statement, adding the panda will leave for China via the Incheon International Airport on a chartered plane.

7,Houthi attack kills eleven govt loyalists in Yemen,DUBAI: A surprise Houthi attack killed 11 fighters loyal to the Yemeni government in the country’s south early on...,"DUBAI: A surprise Houthi attack killed 11 fighters loyal to the Yemeni government in the country’s south early on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the southern forces said, in a rare flareup.
Mohammed al-Naqib from the main southern separatist group the Southern Transitional Council (STC) said their fighters were the target of the attack in Lahij province.
Eleven fighters were killed while repelling the rebels, al-Naqib said. “The Houthis did not advance a single step,” he added.
A military official confirmed the toll, saying the government loyalists thwarted the Houthi attack, which lasted for five hours. He said several rebels were also killed but did not give an overall figure.
Wednesday’s clashes took place near the provincial borders of Taez, a front-line governorate which is split between rebel and government control.
The attack comes despite a lull in fighting that has held in Yemen since the expiry of a six-month truce brokered in April 2022. While hostilities have remained low, sporadic flareups have occasionally gripped parts of the country.
In March last year, at least 10 soldiers were killed in clashes with Houthi rebels in the oil-producing Marib province, a main flashpoint region.
The Houthis seized control of Yemen’s capital Sanaa in 2014, prompting a Saudi-led military intervention the following year.
Nine years of war have left hundreds of thousands dead through direct and indirect causes, and triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.
In December, the UN envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg said warring parties had committed to a new ceasefire and agreed to engage in a UN-led peace process to end the war. But the peace process has stalled in the wake of Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea since November, a campaign the rebels say is meant to signal solidarity with Palestinians amid the Gaza war.
Diplomatic solution
On Wednesday, US special envoy Tim Lenderking said the Red Sea attacks are undermining the peace process.
“Successful negotiations are extremely difficult as long as the Houthis continue their aggressive actions,” he said during a virtual briefing.The  US designation of the Houthis as a terrorist group puts  “additional  pressure” on the group that may discourage attacks on ships in the Red  Sea, but ultimately a diplomatic solution will have to be found in  Yemen, the US Special Envoy for Yemen said on Wednesday.
The  Houthis have attacked international shipping in the Red Sea since  November in what they say is solidarity with the Palestinians, drawing  US and British retaliatory strikes since February. Envoy Tim Lenderking said the purpose of the strikes was to destroy the Houthis’ ability to attack ships.
The  Houthi attacks are undermining progress in the peace process in the  broader Yemeni conflict, Lenderking said after holding meetings in Saudi  Arabia and Oman.
“We favour a diplomatic solution, we know that there is no military solution,” he said.
Saudi  Arabia mediating between the Houthis and the internationally recognised  Yemeni government  “gives us some hope that we can use this moment to  get beyond current tensions”, he added.
