0,Hafiz Naeem elected as JI amir,Outgoing chief Sirajul Haq and Liaquat Baloch were other contestants,"In a significant development within the political landscape of the country, Hafiz Naeemur Rehman on Thursday was elected as the sixth amir (chief) of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), one of the country's prominent religious and political parties, for a five-year term.
The announcement of his election as the new party chief was made following a decision by the majority of the members of JI.
He will serve as the party chief from April 2024 to April 2029.
Addressing a news conference in Lahore, JI Election Commission President Rashid Naseem maintained that 82 per cent votes were cast in the election for amir. Out of a total of 45,000 voters, 6,000 were women.
Hafiz Naeem had previously served as the chief of the party’s Karachi chapter.
Hailing from Karachi, the newly-elected amir is a civil engineer by profession. He also categorises himself as an environmentalist on his social media profiles.
The selection process for the party chief within JI is a significant affair, occurring every five years. This time, the party's central consultative body, known as the Markazi Shura, proposed three names to lead the JI members. Among these names were prominent figures such as Sirajul Haq and Liaquat Baloch, alongside the ultimately successful candidate, Hafiz Naeem.

The outgoing chief, Sirajul Haq, held the position of JI amir since 2014, marking a decade-long tenure. Before him, a lineage of influential leaders including Syed Munawar Hassan, Qazi Hussain Ahmed, Mian Tufail Muhammad, and Maulana Syed Abul Ala Maududi have all held this prestigious responsibility.
It is essential to note the historical significance of JI within the political fabric of Pakistan. Founded in 1941 by Maulana Syed Abul Ala Maududi, the party has played a pivotal role in shaping the ideological and political discourse of the country over the decades.

1,PM vows to uncover ‘toxic letters’ reality,Shehbaz says new IMF programme crucial,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the government was investigating the matter regarding the letters received by judges with suspicious powder.
“The government, with the sense of responsibility, will also probe this matter to uncover the reality,” the prime minister said while speaking with the participants of the cabinet meeting chaired by him.
The incident related to letters allegedly laced with a toxic substance that were received by the judges of the Supreme Court, the Islamabad High Court and the Lahore High Court.
The letters in the top court were sent to Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, and Justice Aminuddin. The letters were received at the Receipt and Issue (R&I) Branch of the apex court from where they were forwarded to the staff of the judges.
Like the earlier letters received by the IHC judges, suspicious powder was also found inside the envelopes and sent to the forensic lab. The letters sent by an unknown group threatened the judges of the Supreme Court for ‘rescuing evil’.
The letters were sent to the judges by two senders but their addresses were not mentioned.
With regard to the deal with the International Monetary Fund, the prime minister said the government was planning to enter a new programme with the IMF which he said, was very important to consolidate the country’s economy.
“With the new IMF programme, the international institutions will have more trust on us and we will be able to move forward on the agenda of development and prosperity with more confidence,” he said.
He said the finance minister was going to Washington this month with a delegation to participate in the IMF spring meetings where he will also discuss details of the new programme with the IMF.
He said although the terms of the new deal would not be so easy, the government will shift the burden of the tough conditions from the less privileged to the wealthier.
The prime minister hoped that after the IMF board meeting, the last tranche of the existing standby agreement worth $1.1 billion will be disbursed to Pakistan this month.
With regard to PIA’s divestment, he said the privatisation process of Pakistan International Airlines was on track and the schedule set for the process would be fully implemented.
He said that for the outsourcing of the airports, a Turkish company was arriving in Islamabad on April 6 which would negotiate the outsourcing process with the Pakistani authorities.
About digitization of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the prime minister informed that the consultants for the digitization process would be appointed by end of the current month.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said, he recently chaired a meeting of Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) in which details of various sectors including finance, investment, exports, Information Technology, agriculture, power and petroleum were discussed.
“After a detailed meeting, it was decided that I will personally review the sector-wise performance to solve out the problems faced by the sectors and to streamline the country’s economy,” he added.

The prime minister pointed out that the government had fulfilled its due responsibility with respect to the inquiry of the matter of letter by the Islamabad High Court judges by forming an inquiry commission led by former Chief Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani. Afterward, he said Tassaduq Hussain Jillani refused from the commission, subsequently the Supreme Court took suo motu notice of the letter.
With respect to the security of the Chinese workers and engineers, the prime minster said the government was evolving a foolproof system for the security of the Chinese workers.
The prime minister said the cabinet presented the finance division’s Fiscal Policy Statement for the financial year 2022-23, the Debt Policy Statement for the financial year 2022-23 and the Year End Government Performance Monitoring Report in the meeting.
The federal cabinet approved the submission of the above statements/report to the National Assembly under prevailing laws, he said.
The meeting was told that the cabinet, on the recommendation of Foreign Affairs Division, allowed former Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Muhammad Amjad Khan Niazi to receive the “King Abdul Aziz Medal Badge of Honor of Excellent Class” on behalf of the Government of Saudi Arabia and “Darjah Kepahlawan Angkatan Tentera” on behalf of the Government of Malaysia.

Likewise, on the recommendation of Ministry of Human Rights, it approved the abolition of the National Commission for Child Welfare and Development, the National Child Protection Center and the Implementation of National Line of Action for Children, which are offices working under the Ministry of Human Rights.
All the employees of these departments who are civil servants would be included in the surplus pool of Pakistan, the meeting was told.
The meeting was also told that under the National Commission on Rights of Child Act 2017, the National Commission on the Rights of Child had been established therefore all other departments had become unnecessary as all the work related to these institutions is done by this commission. Keeping in view the austerity policy of the government, it has been decided to close these institutions, the meeting was told.

2,Pakistan snubs Taliban advice for talks with TTP,Islamabad asks Kabul to take action against terrorist outfits," 
Pakistan on Thursday ruled out any possibility of talks with the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) once again, saying Islamabad expects the interim Afghan government to take action against terrorist hideouts.
Speaking at her weekly news briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said Pakistan had no plan to initiate negotiations with the TTP.
Her statement came a day after a senior Taliban member urged Pakistan and the TTP to restart talks. Afghanistan's Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Nabi Omari has advised Pakistan and the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to resolve their issues through dialogue as the violence in Pakistan ""is spreading to Afghanistan"".
Speaking at an event in Khost, Afghanistan’s Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Nabi Omari said that Afghans had seen wars and revolutions. ""Wars and revolutions create widows, create orphans, destroy the country and the economy,"" Omari noted in an effort to justify the call for talks between Pakistan and the TTP.
He went on to warn Pakistan that if the country’s army is a million or ten million, it is ""our experience that you cannot win this war”. Referring to those fighting against Pakistan brothers, Omari said even if the TTP invokes jihad (holy war), the Afghan Taliban will not interfere.
At the same time, he also advised the TTP and its allied militant groups that ""even if they fight for 100 years, we have nothing to do with it"". The fighting in Pakistan is creating problems for us and the flames are reaching Afghanistan.""
Though Omari didn’t say explicitly, the fact he spoke of the Afghan Taliban facing problems because of the TTP suggested that the terror outfit was operating from the neighbouring country. This was also for the first time any Taliban leader publicly admitted the pressure Kabul had been facing over the TTP issue.
Pakistan tried the peace process in the past at the request of Afghan Taliban. The process initially produced a ceasefire in exchange of Pakistan freeing TTP militants. However, talks collapsed after Pakistan realised that the TTP was using the process to regroup.
Since the change of army command, Pakistan has shut all the doors for talks with TTP. The Afghan Taliban on the other hand are still pushing for the talks. Observers believe that given the position taken by both the sides, the deadlock will continue to persist.
Read Pakistan's patience is wearing thin
On 18 March, Pakistan had to carry out strikes inside Afghanistan after months of frustration over Taliban’s lack of action against the TTP. Sources said the cross-border strikes might be the last option but if terrorist attacks continue Pakistan would be compelled to exercise that option again.
The Foreign Office spokesperson said Pakistan expected Afghan authorities to take urgent action against terrorist outfits and their leadership for the crimes they were committing and the terrorist incidents they were responsible for in Pakistan.
She further said that Pakistan remained committed to fighting against all terrorist outfits which had targeted Pakistan and the symbols of the Pakistan-China friendship.
She said that Afghanistan was discussed at the 19th regular meeting of the secretaries of the security councils of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) held in Kazakhstan on April 3.
Secretary of the National Security Division, Waqar Ahmad, who led the Pakistan delegation at the SCO, warned about the “far-reaching consequences about terrorists acts for the entire region and stressed the need for adopting a comprehensive approach to address the root causes,” Baloch said.
“He termed peaceful and stable Afghanistan a strategic imperative for regional prosperity and called upon SCO member states to follow a holistic policy and build broad convergences with SCO region to address multifaceted challenges confronting Afghanistan,” Baloch said.

3,SC may issue guidelines to judges,Amicable relationship between CJP and current executive likely bolsters government confidence in this sensitive matter,"The Supreme Court, though yet to issue a written decree, appears keen on laying down guidelines for the superior court judges encountering interference or intimidation from agencies during their judicial duties.
Senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah stressed the importance of establishing a code of conduct for superior court judges, a view endorsed by Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Athar Minallah.
However, CJP Qazi Faez Isa has maintained a conspicuous silence on the matter. His sole focus appears to be clarifying his approach to six IHC judges. He has also elucidated on the steps he has taken since March 25.
Furthermore, CJP Isa noted that the judges of the IHC could have pursued contempt notices against the alleged interference or intimidation by agencies.
Despite former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani questioning the legality of the inquiry commission, CJP Isa points towards social media pressure likely being the tipping point for his recusal.
Taking on such a suo motu case is no walk in the park for the executive, but Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Awan remained confident throughout the hearing. His confidence was palpable as he made his case with vigor before the bench.
The amicable relationship between CJP Isa and the current executive likely bolsters government confidence in this sensitive matter.
It appears that CJP Isa was well-prepared to handle the tough case, especially with other judges backing the letter from six IHC judges.
CJP Isa took the lion's share of speaking time, calmly laying out his position. While he remained relaxed, other judges, in particular, seemed on edge throughout the hearing.
The federal government should count its lucky stars for dealing with a chief justice who isn't playing hardball. He has made it crystal clear that there will be no stepping on the toes of executive functionaries.
Similarly, CJP Isa has also emphasised that the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) is the pertinent body to tackle this issue – a stance that has ruffled feathers among the Professional Lawyers Group, who are miffed that CJP Isa is favouring bars where the Independent Group holds sway.
A senior government official also believes that providing guidelines to the high courts and establishing a reporting mechanism, as advocated by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, along with anything achievable through a code of conduct, is something everyone will agree on.
The official added that if the judges wish to investigate these allegations, a sitting Supreme Court judge could chair the commission.
""It is up to the court now to see who should head the commission. Government is not going to appoint anyone on its own,” he added.
Former additional attorney general Waqar Rana stated that every individual expects the court to uphold its constitutional duty of safeguarding the rule of law and ensuring access to justice.
""The Supreme Court is at the apex of the judicial system of Pakistan and thus it is empowered to ensure independence of the judiciary. The Chief Justice and four judges of the Supreme Court are part of the judicial commission and thus it is duty-bound to protect judicial freedom. It is a defining moment in our history,” Waqar said.
Tariq Bashir, an advocate, pointed out that the crux of the matter was uncertainty about the next steps, saying that they are banking on petitioners such as Aitzaz and Hamid Khan to provide suggestions.
There's a possibility that they may proceed with a commission, but only if all parties involved give their consent, he added.
