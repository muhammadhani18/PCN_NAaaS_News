• Insists ex-chief justice Jillani recused himself after baseless criticism
• Justice Mansoor stresses SC can’t ‘bury its head like ostrich’ in face of allegations
ISLAMABAD: Any attack on the judiciary’s independence would not be tolerated, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa said on Wednesday and hinted at forming a full court to hear the allegations of intelligence agencies’ interference in judicial affairs.
Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, the second senior-most judge after the chief justice, also emphasised that the Supreme Court could not “bury its head in the sand like an ostrich” in the face of complaints about meddling in judicial affairs.
He said such complaints needed to be plugged by laying down a strong institutional response through a stringent code of conduct for judges to ensure the independence of the judiciary.
Their remarks came as the Supreme Court took up the case about allegations made by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges regarding interference by the country’s security apparatus in judicial matters.
A seven-member bench — led by Chief Justice Isa and also comprising Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Yahya Afridi, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Athar Minallah, Musarrat Hilali and Naeem Akhtar Afghan — conducted the hearing, which was streamed live on the Supreme Court’s YouTube channel.
Chief Justice Isa said the crux of Wednesday’s proceeding should be that the court would not tolerate interference in judicial matters.
He explained that seven judges conducted the hearing because only this many judges were present in Islamabad, while the rest were either in Karachi or Lahore. The hearing was then postponed to April 29 or 30, after which the proceedings may continue daily.
On April 1, the Supreme Court took suo motu notice and formed a seven-judge bench after former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani withdrew himself to head the one-person inquiry commission proposed to investigate the allegations levelled by the IHC judges against intelligence agencies.
‘Interference must end forever’
During the hearing on Wednesday, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah recalled that the IHC judges, through their letter, were seeking suggestions on what to do if something similar happens again in future.
“We cannot bury our heads in the sand like an ostrich. A system is needed on this matter from a civil judge up to the Supreme Court. The series of interference in the judiciary must end forever,” Justice Shah noted.
He also stressed that the apex court was not interfering in high court affairs but only wanted to empower the high court judges on how to conduct if such thing happens again.
Justice Shah urged bar councils like the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association to come up with suggestions in this regard to close this chapter for now and forever.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail also tried to dispel the impression that the court was doing this exercise for its own cause. He also referred to the filing of a reference against Justice Isa, recalling how the then-prime minister Imran Khan had accepted that it was a mistake and wondered whether the government ever tried to identify the culprits behind it.
Justice Athar Minallah cited an example of granting bail to certain accused by the court recently, but later, the order of the apex court was frustrated by not releasing the accused under the maintenance of public order. The court cannot shut its eyes over extensive abuse, Justice Minallah regretted, adding that the Supreme Court was the custodian of citizens’ fundamental rights.
He also regretted over government’s failure to take the matter of Mian Iftikhar-ud-Din Mirza, who had threatened and hurled abuses against the CJP as well as the institution of the judiciary, to its logical conclusion by emphasising that prosecution was the function of the executive.
Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan had referred to the Mian Iftikhar incident.
Addressing Mr Awan, Justice Minallah said: “You have rightly said that there was political engineering till some time and probably, the perception is that this court was also involved. But what the (IHC judges’) letter is saying is that that is continuing and this is of utmost importance.”
What the IHC judges have pointed out was the normalisation of culture of deviance on part of the state, Justice Minallah regretted.
The attorney general explained that only because of public importance, the federal government had proposed the commission under the Pakistan Inquiry Commission Act 2017.
Recusal due to ‘baseless criticism’
He dispelled an impression that the present government was interfering in judicial matters and said that if the matter involved the independence of the judiciary, the credibility of the executive was also at stake.
However, he assured full cooperation on behalf of the government, also reminding that the prime minister was at the Supreme Court within 24 hours after the full court meeting for consultation and the government appointed the commission since the law said so.
The attorney general contended that there were three aspects: if some code of conduct has to be given, it could be done through the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC); if some guidelines have to be made for the high courts, it could be done through the Supreme Court; and if the court considers the need for an inquiry commission, the court can make a mechanism for which the federal government was committed to extendins complete support.
However, he disagreed with a view that the inquiry commission was powerless, insisting that the commission had great powers, including powers enjoyed by the civil or criminal courts or initiating contempt proceedings, adding that an impression was given as if the federal government wanted to make the commission of its own wish.
At this, Chief Justice Isa regretted that baseless criticism and personal attacks were made against former CJP Jillani, adding that Mr Jillani recused after whatever was said about him on social media.
Justice Isa also said the impression that the Supreme Court had given its powers to the government or the commission was completely wrong.

1,Nine more judges receive ‘toxic’ mail,"CJP Isa, LHC CJ among recipients; CTD registers two cases; all letters sent for forensic analysis.","ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: A day after the judges of the Islamabad High Court received letters allegedly laced with a toxic substance, similar letters arrived in the Supreme Court and the Lahore High Court, prompting the Counter-Terrorism Department to register two terrorism cases in Islamabad and Lahore.
The letters in the top court were sent to CJP Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, and Justice Aminuddin. The letters were received at the Receipt and Issue (R&I) Branch of the apex court from where they were forwarded to the staff of the judges. Like the letters received a day earlier by the IHC judges, suspicious powder was also found inside the envelopes and sent to the forensic lab. The letters sent by an unknown group threatened the judges of the Supreme Court for ‘rescuing evil’.
These letters were sent to the judges by two senders but their addresses were not mentioned.
Over the issue, a case was also registered at the police station of the Counter Terrorism Department under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act and Section 507 of the Pakistan Penal Code in response to a complaint lodged by Mohammad Iqbal, a duty in-charge at the R&I Branch.

CJP Isa, LHC CJ among recipients; CTD registers two cases; all letters sent for forensic analysis

According to the FIR, the letters were received by a clerk of the R&I Branch with routine mail on March 29/30. The letters were forwarded to the secretary of the judges through a naib qasid, it added. Gulshan Khatoon was the sender of two letters whereas one letter was sent by Sajjad Hussain, the FIR said, adding that the letters were, however, sent without complete address of the senders. After the police reached the top court, they confiscated the letters from the R&I Branch.
A police officer told Dawn that each letter had a Rs30 postage stamp but the sealed stamp by the post office on the letters was blurred.
An amount of the suspicious powder was taken from each envelope and would be sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory Islamabad on Thursday (today) for toxicological and chemical tests.
Meanwhile, DIG Opera­tions Shehzad Bukhari appeared before the chief justice and informed the court about the ongoing probe. The police official said that the suspected toxic power and the letters had been sent for forensic analysis. According to the DIG, the Pakistan Post was also in the loop about the investigation.
Letters in LHC
Meanwhile, the letters received by at least five judges of the Lahore High Court were also sent to the forensics laboratory and a case by the CTD was registered. The judges who received the letters were Chief Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, senior puisne judge Justice Shujaat Ali Khan, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, Justice Aalia Neelum, and Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh.
After the matter was reported to the police, Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Bilal Siddique Kamyana, DIG Operations Ali Nasir Rizvi, and other police officials rushed to the high court. The personal staff of the judges found the letters in the daily mail received at the high court, an official told Dawn on condition of anonymity. He said the staff of all judges at the LHC was already alert in the wake of letters sent to the IHC judges.
He said the staff did not open the envelopes and handed them over to police officials. The source said the police also arrested the postman of a private courier company, who supposedly delivered the suspicious letters to the high court with no details of the dispatchers.
CTD registers case
In a late night development, the Punjab police’s Counter Terrorism Department in Lahore lodged an FIR under the anti-terrorism act and other charges against unknown suspects for sending threatening letters to the Lahore High Court’s judges. The case was registered on the complaint of the DSP Security of the Lahore High Court and the letters were sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency for analysis.
An official said that as soon as the LHC alerted police high-ups, senior officers from the CTD and other wings reached there. He said that the police took into custody the suspected letters for analysis, adding that the white powder letters seemed to be anthrax, a bacteria that severely affects humans.
Earlier in the day, DIG Rizvi, in a brief conversation with reporters, confirmed the landing of the suspicious letters in the mail of the judges.
He said officials of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) and the Punjab Forensic Science Agency had been called in to investigate the matter.
He said the police were inspecting the mail of all judges of the LHC to confirm how many judges received such letters. He refused to comment further, saying the authorities would come up with an official statement after the initial investigation. The DIG did not confirm whether the letters contained any toxic chemical or threatening text.

2,"Hundreds hurt, many trapped after Taiwan’s strongest quake in 25 years","TAIPEI: At least nine people were killed and more than 1,000 injured on Wednesday by a powerful earthquake in Taiwan...","

HUALIEN (Taiwan): President-elect Lai Ching-te inspects the damage following the earthquake, on Wednesday. The strongest quake to hit the island in over two decades claimed nine lives, damaged dozens of buildings and prompted tsunami warnings that extended to Japan and the Philippines—Reuters

 
TAIPEI: At least nine people were killed and more than 1,000 injured on Wednesday by a powerful earthquake in Taiwan that damaged dozens of buildings and prompted tsunami warnings that extended to Japan and the Philippines before being lifted.
Dozens of people were believed safe but unreachable in areas cut off by massive landslides triggered by the quake — many in tunnels that cut through the mountains that bisect the island from north to south.
Officials said the quake was the strongest to shake the island in decades, and warned of more tremors in the days ahead.
Strict building regulations and widespread public disaster awareness appear to have staved off a major catastrophe for the earthquake-prone island, which lies near the junction of two tectonic plates.
“We were very lucky,” said a woman surnamed Chang, who lived next door to a printing press warehouse near the capital that virtually pancaked in the quake, but all 50 inside at the time were plucked to safety. “Many of the decorations at home fell on the floor, but people were safe.”
Wu Chien-fu, director of Taipei’s Central Weather Administration’s Seismology Centre, said the quake was the strongest since one of 7.6-magnitude struck in September 1999, killing around 2,400 people in the deadliest natural disaster in the island’s history.
Wednesday’s magnitude-7.4 quake hit just before 8am local time (0000 GMT), with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) putting the epicentre 18 kilometres south of Taiwan’s Hualien City, at a depth of 34.8km.
Three people among a group of seven on an early-morning hike through the hills that surround the city were crushed to death by boulders loosened by the earthquake, officials said.
Separately, three died while driving when their vehicles were hit by tumbling rocks, while another died at a mine quarry.
The National Fire Agency said all the fatalities had been in Hualien county, adding that 1,011 people across Taiwan had sustained injuries without specifying how seriously.
Social media was awash with shared video and images from around the island of buildings swaying as the quake struck.
“It was shaking violently, the paintings on the wall, my TV and liquor cabinet fell,” one man in Hualien told broadcaster SET TV.
Dramatic images were shown on local TV of multi-storey structures in Hualien and elsewhere tilting after the quake ended, while a printing warehouse in New Taipei City crumbled.
The mayor there said more than 50 survivors had been successfully plucked from the ruins of the structure. Local TV channels showed bulldozers clearing rocks along the main route to Hualien, a mountain-ringed coastal county of around 300,000 people that has been cut off by landslides.
The major roads leading to Hualien’s main city pass through an extensive series of strongly built tunnels — some of them kilometres long — and officials said dozens of people could be trapped in vehicles inside.
Dozens of miners were also out of reach at a quarry in Hualien.
“We must carefully check how many people are trapped and we must rescue them quickly,” president-elect and current Vice-President Lai Ching-te told reporters in Hualien.
By nightfall, the county was still experiencing rolling aftershocks as rescuers continued combing through debris.
In Taiwan’s capital, the famed Taipei 101 commercial building lit up to memorialise the victims of the quake.
“Do not go to the mountains unless necessary,” warned President Tsai Ing-wen in a late-night post.
“Aftershocks may occur in the next few days and everyone, please be vigilant and watch out for your own safety.”
Regional impact
In Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines, authorities initially issued tsunami warnings but by around 10am (0200 GMT), the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said the threat had “largely passed”.
In the Taiwanese capital, the metro briefly stopped running but resumed within an hour, while residents received warnings from their local borough chiefs to check for any gas leaks.
Across the Taiwan Strait, social media users in China’s eastern Fujian province and elsewhere said they also felt strong tremors.
Residents of Hong Kong also reported feeling the earthquake.

3,‘Let’s finish this now’: IHC judge seeks end to curbs on X,"ISLAMABAD: Taking exception to the response of a joint secretary of the interior ministry, the chief justice of...","ISLAMABAD: Taking exception to the response of a joint secretary of the interior ministry, the chief justice of Islamabad High Court on Wednesday rejected a report on digital media outages and summoned the interior secretary along with documentary evidence providing the ground for disruption of social media app, X, formerly known as Twitter, in Pakistan.
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, who was hearing a petition seeking the restoration of the social networking app, summoned the interior secretary on April 17.
Access to X has been disrupted in Pakistan since February 17, when former Rawalpindi commissioner Liaquat Chattha accused the chief election commissioner and chief justice of Pakistan of being involved in alleged rigging the 2024 general elections.
“Elections have concluded. Let’s finish this now. Let the interior secretary come, then we will see. If the secretary is unable [to give reasons], then I will summon the prime minister,” the chief justice warned.
Earlier, the joint secretary of the interior ministry appeared before the court and submitted a report stating that X was disrupted on the basis of reports by intelligence agencies that the contents being uploaded was a ‘threat to national security’.
While terming the report ‘unsatisfactory’, Justice Farooq asked the official to produce documentation to substantiate the information provided in the report.
He remarked, “There is malice in every institution. What can I say?”
“Whatever the threats are, give detailed reasons and evidence,” the IHC CJ said, adding that a report based on speculations should not be submitted.
The joint secretary urged the court to give “one more chance”, a Dawn.com report added.
The court then summoned the interior ministry secretary at the next hearing on April 17 and directed him to produce evidence on the threat to national security.
The petition was filed by Ehtisham Abbasi, a resident of Islamabad, and named the information ministry and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) as the respondents in the case.
It urged the high court to issue directives to the respondents to “immediately lift the ban on X (Twitter) access in the interest of justice”.
It argued that the “act of the respondents against journalists particularly in the recent past is highly violative” of Article 19 of the Constitution (freedom of speech).
Referring to the “very important fundamental right” as provided under Article 14 of the Constitution (inviolability of dignity of man, etc), the plea said that the “liberty of a person” was a “pivotal right and falls squarely within the ambit of right to life and dignity of a person”.
The petition asserted that the “impugned inaction of the respondents is deliberate, arbitrary, mala fide, without lawful authority” and “derogatory” to the provisions of the Constitution and the fundamental rights guaranteed therein.
It added that the “impugned inaction is patently void, ab initio, a contrived an untenable, misplaced, misdirected, unfounded, erroneous, contrary to the law and facts on the record”, and was liable to be set aside by the IHC.
The petitioner further argued that the disruption of X “suffers from serious legal infirmities as the same is not sustainable in view of the settled law” and that “a number of other constitutional and statutory rights have been infringed and circumvented”.

4,"Afghan minister asks TTP, Islamabad to negotiate","In rare remarks, Omari says escalation of conflict in Pakistan also affects situation in Afghanistan.","PESHAWAR: Acknowledging that the activities by an outlawed militant organisation inside Pakistan were leading the international community to point fingers at Afghanistan, a senior Afghan Taliban leader on Wednes­day urged the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Islamabad to sit together and negotiate for peace.
“We ask the government of Pakistan and advise the brothers (TTP) who are fighting with them to come together and talk,” Muhammad Nabi Omari, deputy interior minister of the interim Taliban government in Afghanistan told an iftar gathering in the southeastern Khost town.
The Afghan Taliban have been privately urging Pakistan and the TTP to engage in direct negotiations to end over a two-decade-long conflict that has claimed thousands of lives and seen massive displacement of people in the tribal region straddling Afghanistan.
But this marks the first time a senior Afghan Taliban figure has chosen to publicly speak on the subject, not only calling for direct engagement between Islamabad and the TTP, but also chiding the militant conglomerate.

In rare remarks, Omari says escalation of conflict in Pakistan also affects situation in Afghanistan

Attempts by the Afghan interim regime to “facilitate” talks between the two sides in the past have ended in deadlock, prompting Islamabad to accuse Kabul of providing sanctuary and urging it to take action against the militant organisation.
The Afghan Taliban have strenuously denied that the TTP is using the Afghan soil and have been urging Pakistan to look inward to address its internal security problems.
Relations between the two countries have been strained ever since Pakistan carried out airstrikes in Khost and Paktika in retaliation for the death of seven of its soldiers in a suicide bombing in North Waziristan in March.
“We have seen war and revolution”, Omari was quoted by Afghan media outlet ToloNews as saying. “These wars and revolutions leave behind widows and orphans, destroy homeland and ruin the economy,” he said.
“Now the world makes excuses that terrorists are present here [in Afghanistan] and Al Qaeda exists”, the deputy interior minister said. “I swear, based on our information… there is not a single Al-Qaeda member in Afghanistan”, Omari said.
The deputy interior minister however, did not address the presence of TTP in Afghanistan.
Omari cautioned Islamabad and the TTP that both sides could not win the war. Citing the Afghan Taliban experience, the senior Taliban figure said that even if Pakistan had a ten million strong army, it could not eliminate its opponents.
Likewise, he said, the TTP too could not win this war. He said that the Afghan Taliban could win the war because the whole Afghan nation was behind them, supporting them with food and shelter.
“And to our brothers (the TTP), whatever, they may call it – jihad or war, we don’t meddle in their affairs, if they are fighting against the system (state), even if you fight the system for hundred years … you cannot win”, he said, citing the Afghan Taliban experience.
In the same breath, Omari again chided the TTP without naming them, that it possibly did not enjoy mass support amongst the Pakistani population.
“We have got nothing to do it with it,” he said, adding quickly “but we are getting the heat for it”, in a short video posted on social media. “The escalation of conflict in Pakistan affects the situation in Afghanistan”.
It was not immediately clear what prompted a high profile figure to speak on an issue, which the Kabul leadership has been shying away from discussing publicly citing its sensitivity.
Pakistan’s stated policy has thus far been that it would not engage in any direct talks with the TTP and that the Afghan interim regime is bound under the terms of Doha agreement to take action against the outfit.
A highly placed source said that Pakistan had collected evidence of the TTP’s involvement in the killing of Chinese workers in Besham, which would be shared with Beijing, which is likely to take it up with Kabul.
China has been a major investor in Afghanistan and has senior level diplomatic presence in both countries, recently having formally accepted the credentials of Kabul’s ambassador.

5,US pledges to expand security partnership with Pakistan,Emphasises need to ensure that international assistance sent to Afghanistan does not reach “unintended recipients”.,"WASHINGTON: The State Department said on Wednesday that the United States would continue to expand its security partnership with Pakistan.
At a news briefing in Washington, a US official also emphasised the need to ensure that international assistance sent to Afghanistan did not reach “unintended recipients”.
When reminded of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer to work with the US on the shared targets of international peace and regional security, Spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington was also willing to do so.
The prime minister made this offer earlier this week while responding to a friendly letter from US President Joe Biden, expressing the desire to strengthen bilateral ties.
“We will continue to expand the security partnership between the United States and Pakistan,” Mr Miller said, when asked how the US could help Pakistan fight the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militant groups. “We have spoken to that a number of times from this podium. It has been a priority for us and will continue to be so,” he added.
Mr Miller disagreed with a journalist who claimed that the United States was keen to condemn the arrest of opposition leaders in India, but ignored those in Pakistan. “I would not agree with that characterisation. We have made clear on a number of occasions that we want to see everyone in Pakistan treated consistent with the rule of law, treated with respect for human rights as is our position with any country in the world,” he said
Responding to a question about an Indian intelligence operator’s attempt to assassinate a Sikh lawyer in New York, the US official said: “We have made clear to the government of India that we want to see them conduct a full investigation and we continue to look forward to the results of that investigation.”
Responding to another question about UN aid reaching militants in Afghanistan, he said: “We require all of our partners’ safeguard in place to ensure the assistance reaches those who need it.”
The United States, he said, also monitors “all of our assistance programmes” to ensure that US assistance did not “indirectly benefit the Taliban or could be diverted to unintended recipients.”

6,Qureshi paying the price for siding with Imran: lawyer Salman Safdar,"Defence counsel tells IHC cipher was never made part of court record; law officer details ""facilities"" for ex-PM at Adiala.","ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: The defence counsel in the cipher case informed the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday that ex-foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi was facing legal proceedings for not testifying against former prime minister Imran Khan.
Barrister Salman Safdar, counsel for the two PTI leaders, told the division bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb that Mr Qureshi was under tremendous pressure to testify against Mr Khan.
He contended that Mr Qureshi was implicated in the case as a consequence of his refusal to speak against the former PM. The counsel maintained that former principal secretary to PM Azam Khan had availed ‘the offer’ and got off scot-free.
He pointed out that complainant Yousaf Naseem Khokhar, who was interior secretary at the time, had not nominated Mr Khan and Mr Qureshi in his complaint. He said the case was registered under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), which was promulgated by the British government over a century ago.

Defence counsel tells IHC cipher was never made part of court record; law officer details ‘facilities’ for ex-PM at Adiala

Chief Justice Farooq reminded him that successive governments, including the PTI’s, had never tried to repeal the law, therefore, this argument did not carry weight.
Barrister Safdar went on to state that the OSA could only be used for sharing information with the enemy of the state, adding that a traitor, not a patriotic citizen, could be prosecuted under this law.
He argued that the former premier had informed the people of Pakistan about foreign interference, since the cipher carried “threatening tone of a US diplomat”, adding that it was because of this that the National Security Committee had decided to issue a demarche to the US.
The counsel informed the court that neither the cipher nor the demarche had been made part of the judicial record during proceedings.
“These documents were deliberately not brought to the court record since it would have revealed the facts,” he added.
Even the complainant was not aware of the contents of cipher, he stated.
The lawyer argued that Mr Khan has been accused of negligence in the cipher case for not keeping the confidential document in safe custody.
He said then-principal secretary Azam Khan was responsible for the safe custody of cipher. However, he has been pardoned for testifying against Imran Khan.
The bench inquired if there was any record of cipher’s movement from the principal secretary to the prime minister, and so on.
The counsel expressed his ignorance. The court then asked the prosecution for response at their turn.
Further hearing on the appeals of Mr Khan and Mr Qureshi was adjourned to Thursday (today).
Prison facilities
Separately, the Punjab government informed the Lahore High Court (LHC) that seven cells had been allocated for Imran Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail.
Advocate General of Punjab (AGP) Khalid Ishaq stated this during the hearing of a petition filed by the president of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Lawyers Forum, Azeem Pahat, about security of Mr Khan in the jail.
The chief law officer said an accommodation of six cells had been made for the PTI’s founding chairman in addition to the cell already allotted to him. He said one guard is deputed for security of every ten inmates in Adiala jail. However, security of the former premier has been assigned to 14 personnel.
The AGP said the monthly expense for Mr Khan’s security is Rs1.2 million. He said extra CCTV cameras had also been installed for his security.
He pointed out that food for the PTI’s founder is cooked in a kitchen exclusively dedicated for him.
Lahore High Court Bar Association President Asad Manzoor Butt, who appeared on behalf of the petitioner, thanked the AGP for providing these details.
He said the petitioner was satisfied with the government’s report and wanted to withdraw the petition.
LHC Chief Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan adjourned the matter till April 16 so that some relevant petitions could also be disposed of.
The petitioner said due to security threats, jail authorities had imposed restrictions on meetings with the PTI founder.
He said the life of the former prime minister was at risk.
Therefore, he added, an order should be issued to provide complete protection to the life of Imran Khan.
