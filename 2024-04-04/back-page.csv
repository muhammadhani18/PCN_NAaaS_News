0,Palestine revives bid to become UN member,"Arab League, OIC, NAM tell Guterres 140 countries have recognised Palestinian statehood.","UNITED NATIONS: Palestine on Tuesday officially revived their bid for a full member state in the United Nations — a process with an uncertain outcome but one they say is necessary in the face of Israel’s offensive in Gaza.
The Palestinians, who have had observer status at the world body since 2012, have lobbied for years to gain full membership, which would amount to recognition of Palestinian statehood.
In a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, dated Tuesday and seen by AFP, UN envoy Riyad Mansour requested “upon instructions of the Palestinian leadership” that an application dating back to 2011 be reconsidered.
The letter has been transmitted to the Security Council, and the Palestinians have asked that it be reviewed this month, according to the documents seen by AFP.

Arab League, OIC, NAM tell Guterres 140 countries have recognised Palestinian statehood

Mansour has repeatedly said in recent months that given Israel’s military offensive in the Gaza Strip since October 7, UN membership is a priority for the Palestinians.
“It was the international community that decided to create two states in Palestine since 1947,” Mansour said in February.
“It is the duty of the international community along with the Palestinian people to complete that exercise by admitting the state of Palestine to membership.”
Last month, he said the Palestinians would “start mobilising the largest number of countries to support us” and expressed hope that the council would act in April, pointing to a council meeting set for April 18 on the situation in Gaza.
Malta, which holds the rotating Security Council presidency, said Mansour’s letter was “received and circulated” to council members, adding that talks would be held “on a way forward”.
The League of Arab States, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement sent a letter to Guterres on Tuesday, also seen by AFP, supporting the bid by the Palestinians.
“We wish to bring to your attention that, as of this date, 140 member states have recognised the state of Palestine,” said the joint letter, which included a list of those countries.
US veto?
The 2011 application, launched by Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas, never came before the Security Council for a vote, and the General Assembly voted to grant the Palestinians observer status in November 2012.
Any request to become a UN member state must first be recommended by the council, then endorsed by a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly.
Observers believe the Palestinian push for membership is unlikely to reach the assembly as the United States, Israel’s closest ally, could use its Security Council veto power to derail the recommendation.
“I find it very hard to see the US swallowing this proposal,” Richard Gowan, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, said, noting that it took months for Washington to agree not to block a council resolution calling for a Gaza ceasefire.
“As far as Washington is concerned, for­cing Palestinian statehood up the agenda is simply likely to make coaxing Israel into a ceasefire harder,” Gowan said.
To win the council’s approval, the Palestinians would have to secure nine votes from the 15 members and no veto from any of the five permanent members: Britain, France, China, Russia and the United States.
For now, Israel has clearly rejected a two-state solution, and its parliament voted overwhelmingly in February against any unilateral recognition of Palestinian statehood.
Several European countries — Britain, France and Spain — have raised the possibility of considering recognition.
In February, French President Emmanuel Macron said such a move was no longer “taboo”. A new draft Security Council resolution written by France — now in the early stages of negotiations — raises the idea of “intent to welcome the State of Palestine as a full member of the United Nations,” according to a text seen by AFP.
In November 1947, the UN General Assembly voted to divide the British Mandate for Palestine into two states — one Jewish, one Arab.
But only Israel was established on May 14, 1948, sparking a war between the new nation and several Arab countries.
For Gowan, “the Palestinians know that they have a moment to push this issue now, which may fade away if there is a ceasefire and UN members focus on other issues”.

1,"Criticism, anger after revelation aid convoy targeted three times","US president says he is ‘outraged, heartbroken’, insists findings of Israel’s probe must be made public","

PARIS: World powers widely condemned an Israeli strike in the Gaza Strip that killed seven charity staff delivering desperately needed aid to the war-torn territory.
The Monday’s strike targeted the World Central Kitchen convoy travelling on a “pre-approved rou­te” three times, according to a rep­ort by Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
World Central Kitchen — one of two NGOs spearheading efforts to distribute aid brought by boat — said the Israeli strike killed Australian, British, Palestinian, Polish and US-Canadian staff.
US President Joe Biden said he was “outraged and heartbroken”. In a strongly worded statement, he said Israel’s investigation of the strike “must be swift, it must bring accountability, and its findings must be made public”.

US president says he is ‘outraged, heartbroken’, insists findings of Israel’s probe must be made public

Mr Biden added that the provision of humanitarian relief in the Palestinian territory has been difficult “because Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians”.
The United Nations says the war has left almost 200 aid workers dead, including more than 175 members of the UN’s staff. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the strike “unconscionable” but added that it was “an inevitable result of the way the war is being conducted”.
“It demonstrates yet again the urgent need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages, and the expansion of humanitarian aid into Gaza,” he said in a speech to the UN General Assembly.
Israel’s army acknowledged on Wednesday it had committed a “grave mistake.”
“It shouldn’t have happened,” IDF chief Herzi Halevi said in a video message, as he blamed the strike on a “misidentification — at night during a war in very complex conditions”.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he called WCK founder, chef Jose Andres, to express his “deep sorrow and sincere apologies over the tragic loss of life”.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike was “unintentional” but stopped short of apologising for the deaths that he described as a “tragic case”. The Israeli army has vowed to hold an investigation and promised to “share our findings transparently”.
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was “shocked and saddened” after learning that British nationals were among those killed.
He spoke to Netanyahu and told the Israeli leader that “he was appalled by the killing of aid workers”, a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. The UK summoned the Israeli ambassador to express its “unequivocal condemnation”.
French Foreign Minister Stepha­­ne Sejourne said that “nothing justifies such a tragedy”, adding that “protecting humanitarian workers is a moral and legal imperative that everyone must adhere to”.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese slammed the “completely unacceptable” attack, called it a “tragedy that should never have occurred”, and offered “sincere condolences” to the family of Australian volunteer Lalzawmi “Zomi” Frankcom, who was killed in the strike.
Indiscriminate killing
The founder and leader of World Central Kitchen, Spanish-born US-based chef Andres, said he was “heartbroken and grieving for their families and friends and our whole WCK family”.
“The Israeli government needs to stop this indiscriminate killing,” he wrote on social media. “It needs to stop restricting humanitarian aid, stop killing civilians and aid workers, and stop using food as a weapon.”
The charity said it had coordinated its movements with the Israeli army and was travelling in vehicles branded with its logo. It has now paused its operations in Gaza.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who on Tuesday was visiting a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan, said, “I expect and demand that the Israeli government clarify as soon as possible the circumstances of this brutal attack”.
The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who is also Spanish, said that “despite all the demands to protect civilians and humanitarian workers, we see new innocent casualties”.
Criticism also came from Beij­ing, which said it was “shocked” by the strike.

2,Video shows US police shooting teen they were supposed to rescue,15-year-old gunned down as police called her away from her gun-toting father.,"LOS ANGELES: Newly relea­sed video shows US police shooting dead a kidnapped teenage girl they had been tasked with rescuing, in a chaotic incident on a busy California highway.
Savannah Graziano, 15, was gunned down as one deputy called her away from her gun-toting father, who had killed her mother a day earlier and abducted his daughter.
The episode unfolded in September 2022 when off­icers in San Bernardino county, east of Los Ange­les, began chasing the vehicle Anthony Graziano was driving with Savan­nah in the passenger seat.
Footage filmed by a California highway patrol helicopter shows the pickup truck racing along at upwards of 175 kilometres an hour, with multiple shots fired at police from inside Graziano’s vehicle. The chase ended after Graziano went the wrong way up a freeway entrance ramp and came to a halt on scrubland, surrounded by police vehicles.
Footage shows Savan­nah getting out of the car and walking towards a policeman, who can be heard on another recording calling her over. Radio traffic apparently from the helicopter warns police that Savannah is there. “The girl’s out. The girl’s out. Alr­i­­ght, girl’s out, guys. The female...is out. She’s out on the passenger side,” a man says.
It shows Savannah crouching on the ground for several seconds before getting up and walking towards a group of policemen. An apparent gunshot is heard on the video and Savannah is then blurred out as the voice on the radio says “Oh no”. Audio captured by a microphone worn by a police official on the ground records him calling Savannah over.
“Come to me! Come, come, come... walk, walk, walk,” he says, as heavy gunfire rings out. “Hey! Stop! Stop shooting her,” he tells his colleagues. “He’s in the car!”
Several shots can be he­­ard after this utterance.The teenager was decla­red dead in a hospital.

3,Iftar at White House ‘downgraded’ after boycott by Muslims,Underscores strained relationship between the Biden administration and the Muslim American community over the conflict in Gaza.,"WASHINGTON: The White House converted an Iftar-dinner into a meeting on Tuesday night to appease American Musl­­im leaders frustrated with the administration’s Gaza policy.
Originally slated as a dinner, the event was reshaped into a meeting format after a number of Muslim leaders declined the invitation, while others raised concerns over the situation in Gaza.
CNN reported that the Iftar-dinner was changed to a meeting because “participants didn’t feel comfortable having a celebratory meal while hundreds of thousands in Gaza are on the brink of famine”.
The meeting was attended by Vice President Kamala Harris, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, administration officials, and a small group of Muslim community leaders.
Later, Thaer Ahmad, a Palestinian American physician, told CNN he went to the meeting but left abruptly, as did some other guests. Explaining his decision, Dr Ahmad said he told President Joe Biden, “It’s disappointing that I’m the only Palestinian here, and out of respect for my community, I’m going to leave.”
The development underscores the strained relationship between the Biden administration and the Muslim American community over the war in Gaza.
Rejected invitations and growing dissatisfaction over US support for Israel amidst the Gaza crisis have exacerbated tensions.
Emgage Action, a Muslim American advocacy group, said it declined the invitation because of concerns over US military aid to Israel and its implications for the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
Reports in the US media suggested participants used the meeting to discuss pressing matters such as aid distribution, increased medical facilities, and violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza.
Dr Nahreen Ahmed, an ICU physician, stressed the importance of humanising the plight in Gaza and urged for stronger US intervention to safeguard civilians and aid workers.
The US media also reported that some attendees expressed disappointment over what they perceived as a lack of tangible outcomes from the meeting.
Political implications
The event’s downscaled natu­­re reflects the political hurdles con­­fronting the Biden administration amid the Israel-Gaza conflict. Growing public dissatisfaction and activism within key communities, including Arab, Pa­­­­lestinian, and Muslim Americans, pose political chal­­­lenges for Biden, particularly in battleground states like Michigan where Muslim American populations wield influence.
Acknowledging the sensitivity of the moment, a White House official said in a statement that “President Biden and Vice President Harris know this is a deeply painful moment for many in the Muslim and Arab communities”.
The official said President Bi­­den “made clear that he mourns the loss of every innocent life in this conflict” and expressed commitment “to continue working to secure an immediate ceasefire as part of a deal to free the hostages and significantly increase humanitarian aid into Gaza”.

4,UN rights body to mull call for Israel arms embargo,"Tabled by Pakistan on behalf of OIC, draft resolution condemns use of starvation as tool of warfare.","GENEVA: The UN Human Rights Council will consider on Friday a draft resolution moved by Pakistan calling for an arms embargo on Israel, citing the “plausible risk of genocide in Gaza”.
If the draft resolution is adopted, it would mark the first time that the United Nations’ top rights body has taken a position on the war raging in Gaza.
The text condemns “the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects by Israel” in populated areas of Gaza and demands Israel “uphold its legal responsibility to prevent genocide”.
The draft resolution was brought forward by Pakistan on behalf of 55 of the 56 UN member states in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) — the exception being Albania.

Tabled by Pakistan on behalf of OIC, draft resolution condemns use of starvation as tool of warfare

The text is co-sponsored by Bolivia, Cuba and the Palestinian mission in Geneva.
The eight-page draft demands Israel end its occupation of Palestinian territory and immediately lifts its “illegal blockade” on the Gaza Strip.
It calls upon countries to stop the sale or transfer of arms, munitions and other military equipment to Israel, citing “a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza”.
The draft also “condemns the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare”, calls for an immediate ceasefire and “condemns Israeli actions that may amount to ethnic cleansing”.
‘Collective punishment’
Last week, the UN Security Council in New York passed a resolution calling for a ceasefire — thanks to an abstention from Washington, Israel’s closest ally.
The draft being brought in Geneva calls on states to ensure that UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, receives sufficient funding and demands Israel stop expanding settlements in Palestinian territories.
It “reaffirms that criticism of violations of international law by Israel should not be conflated with anti-Semitism”.
The resolution condemns the firing of rockets against Israeli civilian areas and demands “the immediate release of all remaining hostages and detainees”.
The council will discuss on Friday whether to adopt the resolution, alongside three other resolutions concerning Israeli settlements, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, and human rights in the occupied Syrian Golan.
Israel has long accused the Human Rights Council of being biased against it.

5,"Giants of Indian politics live on, in digital form, long after death",BENGALURU: Death has not extinguished the decades-long rivalry between two Indian leaders: both have now seemingly...,"BENGALURU: Death has not extinguished the decades-long rivalry between two Indian leaders: both have now seemingly risen from the grave, in digital form, to rally their supporters ahead of national elections.
Political parties are harnessing powerful artificial intelligence tools to make deepfakes, reproducing famous faces and voices in ways that often appear authentic.
Both the government and campaigners have warned that the spread of such tools is a dangerous and growing threat to the integrity of elections in India.
With a marathon six-week general election starting on April 19, so-called “ghost appearances” — the use of dead leaders in videos — have become a popular mode of campaigning in the southern Tamil Nadu state.
Actress turned politician J. Jayalalithaa died in 2016, but she has been featured in a voice message deeply critical of the state’s current governing party, once led by arch-rival M. Karunanidhi.
“We have a corrupt and useless state government,” her digital avatar says.
“Stand by me... we are for the people.” Karunanidhi died in 2018 but has appeared in AI-generated videos -- clad in his trademark black sunglasses -- showering praise on his son M. K. Stalin, the state’s current chief minister.
Recycling “very charismatic” speakers offered a novel way to grab attention, said Senthil Nayagam, founder of Chennai-based firm Muonium, which made the AI video purporting to be Karunanidhi.
Resurrecting dead leaders is also a cost-effective way of campaigning compared to traditional rallies, which are time-consuming to organise and expensive to stage for voters accustomed to a grand spectacle.
“Bringing crowds is a difficult thing,” Nayagam told AFP. “And how many times can you do a laser or drone show?”
Very thin line
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been an eager early adopter of technology in election campaigning.
In 2014, the year he swept to power, the party expanded Modi’s campaign reach by using 3D projections of the leader to make him appear virtually at rallies.
But harnessing technology that can clone a politician’s voice, and create videos so seemingly real that voters struggle to decipher reality from fiction, has naturally sparked concern.
Ashwini Vaishnaw, the communications minister, said in November that deepfakes were “a serious threat to democracy and social institutions”.
AI creator Divyendra Jadoun said he had received a “huge surge” of requests for content from his company, The Indian Deepfaker.
“There is a huge risk in this coming election, and I am pretty damn sure many people are using it for unethical activities,” the 30-year-old said.
Jadoun’s repertoire includes voice cloning, chatbots and mass dissemination of finished products through WhatsApp messaging, sharing content instantly with up to 400,000 people for 100,000 rupees ($1,200).
He insisted that he turned down offers that he disagreed with, but said it was a “very thin line” to determine whether or not a request for his services was unethical.
“Sometimes even we get confused,” he added.
Jadoun said the rapidly advancing technology was little understood by a “big part of the country”, and AI products were taken by many to be true.
“We only tend to fact-check videos which don’t align with our preconceived notions,” he warned.
Most AI-generated campaign material has so far been used to lampoon rivals, especially through song.
This week a leader of the BJP’s youth wing posted an AI-generated video of Arvind Kejriwal, a leading opponent of Modi arrested last month in a graft probe.
It shows him sitting behind bars, strumming a guitar and singing a verse from a popular Bollywood song: “Forget me, for you have to live without me now.” Elsewhere, digitally altered videos purport to show lawmaker Asaduddin Owaisi, one of India’s most prominent Muslim politicians, singing devotional Hindu songs.
A caption alongside the video on Facebook jokes that “anything is possible” if Modi’s party, known for its Hindu-nationalist politics and accused of discriminating against India’s Muslim minority, wins again.
Joyojeet Pal, an expert in the role of technology in democracy from the University of Michigan, said that ridiculing a political opponent was a more effective campaigning tool than “calling them a thug or a crook”.
Mocking opponents in political cartoons is a centuries-old tactic, but Pal warned that AI-generated images can easily be misinterpreted as real.
“It is a threat to what we can and cannot believe,” he said. “It is a threat to democracy as a whole.”
