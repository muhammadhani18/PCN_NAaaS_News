0,Intercity transporters raise fares ahead of Eid,Immigrant workers will start leaving the twin cities for their native areas today,"With the increase in the prices of petroleum products, the transport terminal owners across the district have increased the fares of all routes by Rs100 to Rs300 on the occasion of Eidul Fitr. Local route fares have also been increased by Rs5 to Rs10.
From Friday [today], residents of other cities will start leaving the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad for their native areas to celebrate Eid with their loved ones. Next Tuesday, April 9, will be the last working day before Eid. Due to Saturday and Sunday being holidays, the departure of residents of other cities will start on Friday.
On the instructions of the district administration, the secretary of the Regional Transport Authority has called an important joint meeting of the owners of all transport terminals and major transporters across the district today, Wednesday, April 3, to prevent overloading and overcharging in Eid transport. Efforts will be made to reduce it while the transporters have refused to reduce the transport fares on the occasion of Eid.
Four special Eid trains of Pakistan Railways will also start from Sunday, April 7. The booking of all four special Eid trains has been completed. The Railway Reservation Office has closed the booking of all train seats two days before Eid due to which the burden of all Eid traffic has fallen on general transport vehicles.
Passengers going to different cities from Rawalpindi have been worried since not a single Eid train is running from Rawalpindi and Islamabad this year. All residents of other cities in Rawalpindi and Islamabad have been left at the mercy of bus transport, while it has been decided to install one or more additional coaches with each train three days before Eid. Any additional coaches will not have their tickets booked. All these seats will be allotted on a first-come, first-served basis at the station.
Preparations for the Eid service have been completed in all 33 transport terminals, including General Bus Stand Pirwadhai, Rawalpindi.
According to Transport Federation Vice President Asif Khan, vehicles will be available from Rawalpindi to Peshawar, Nowshehra, Bannu, Gilgit-Baltistan, Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Multan, Karachi and all cities of Azad Kashmir. Booking of tickets has also been started for all routes. For the convenience of passengers, the service will be started immediately after sehri and will continue for 24 hours.
He said not only the increase in the petroleum products are the reason for the increase in fares, but in the first place all the vehicles have become expensive by lakhs of rupees, the price of spare parts and tyres has increased by 500% and transport drivers, helpers and labour have also become expensive. Also, vehicle repair costs have increased. While traffic police challan fines have also increased many times. This year, the increase in fares on Eidul Fitr will also be proportional to inflation.
The increased fare table will also be formally issued today, Wednesday, April 3.
The district administration has deployed police at transport terminals from Saturday to Eid day from April 6 to April 10 and issued strict action orders against overloading and overcharging.
The transporters this year have decided to charge the luggage fare separately along with the passenger and an eight-year-old child will also have a ticket.

1,Study highlights growth in non-formal education,PIE report says there has been marked improvement in registration of girls,"Federal Secretary for Education and Professional Training Mahmoodul Din Wani launched the Non-Formal Education Statistics Report 2021-22 of the Pakistan Institute of Education (PIE) on Thursday.
The report shows that there has been an increase in the number of non-formal education (NFE) centres and teachers, as well as a marked improvement in the registration of girls.
“To equip the new generation with education and professional training, we will have to come out of traditional teaching and take full advantage of technology,” he said and added that the PIE has published several reports on the weaknesses, problems and challenges in the education sector during the year. The Ministry of Education will benefit greatly from the PIE’s data-based reports.
Wani said that non-formal education will not only increase the literacy rate but also provide access to education for out-of-school children. He said that only through social and technical skills can we make the new generation useful and respectable citizens.
Speaking on the occasion, PIE Director General Dr Muhammad Shahid Soroya said that PIE has established the Non-Formal Education Management Information System (NFEMIS) in collaboration with JICA. With the help of this system, authenticated data of non-formal education has been collected.
He said this data includes information on learners, teachers, educational centres, educational performance, attendance records, tracking of learners, status of out-of-school children (OOSC), and centre monitoring.
He said that the purpose of the report is to present a clear picture to all stakeholders, including lawmakers, policymakers, educationists, and researchers.
According to the report, there are 27,763 NFE centres in the country, including Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, with an enrolment of 919,128 students. Of these, 296,843 students have been brought into the mainstream.
Overall, 59% of the students enrolled in NFE are girls, with Sindh having the highest girls' registration rate (73%) and Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan having the lowest (51%). Punjab has the highest number of students enrolled in NFE (46%), while Azad Kashmir and Islamabad have the lowest (2%).
79% of NFE centres are co-education centres, which has helped to increase the girls' registration rate. As a result, the rate has increased from 54% in the previous reporting period to 59%.
Of the 27,763 teachers in NFE institutions, 81% are women. The rate is 87% in Islamabad and 65% in Gilgit-Baltistan.
According to the NFE Statistical Report, after the non-formal education centres under the management of NCHD and BECS were transferred to the School Education Department, approximately 296,843 students were enrolled in the general education system.
The report says that 94% of NFE centres are for out-of-school children, while the remaining 6% are for youth and adult literacy. Of the total NFEB/ALP centres, 98% are at the primary level, while only 2% are at the middle level. These figures indicate that children who graduate from NFEB/ALP centres at the primary level have fewer opportunities to continue their education up to the middle level.
The report also states that ALP (Middle Tech) is a new educational programme that has been developed by Allama Iqbal Open University in collaboration with JICA-AQAL. It is being implemented in a hybrid mode across the country. The data also shows that 0.3% of the total NFE learners are refugees and children without state affiliation (4%). Of the foreign students, 96% are Afghan refugees, while only 4% of the children without state affiliation are of Bengali and Burmese origin. Similarly, according to the report, 2% of the total registered students are non-Muslims, of whom 86% are Hindus and 14% are Christians. It is noteworthy that 36% of non-Muslim students are girls.
The report data shows that 81% of the students registered in NFE are registered with government NFE organizations, while the remaining 19% are registered with private or development sector organizations. About 71 organisations are working in the NFE sector, of which government departments and directorates play a major role and also provide the bulk of the funding.
However, the role of the private or development sector in ensuring the right to education for all children also needs to be appreciated.

2,Steep rise in poultry prices,"Inflation, Ramazan demand and other factors lead to increase in chicken, egg prices","The price of poultry chicken during the second half of the holy months of Ramazan reached Rs445 per kg and the price of poultry eggs reached Rs290 per dozen in the open market in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
The meat of poultry chicken has reached prices of Rs650 to 660 per kg in the open market and the price of poultry chickens and eggs has been going for Rs445 per kg and Rs 290 dozen and higher since the last few months. The high prices are becoming more and more unaffordable for consumers by the day.
The prices of poultry items have increased by 30 per cent in the twin cities during the last month since Ramazan began, which has created great volatility in the market. According to a market survey, during the last two months in the twin cities, a 28 per cent increase has been witnessed in the price of poultry chicken, while a 30 per cent increase was observed in the price of poultry eggs in the same period.
The former Chairman of the Pakistan Poultry Association (PPA), Dr Sajjad Arshad said that the increase in the current prices of poultry was due to demand and supply factors during Ramazan. He said that an increase was observed in poultry business inputs and cost of doing across the country due to which the market was in crisis.
Dr Arshad further said that the country's economic conditions are also an important issue. “The poultry feed ingredients imported from foreign countries are expensive. Soybean is an important feed product. However, since many soybean-carrying ships were stopped at the Karachi port, this has an inevitable impact on poultry prices”.
“The increase in poultry prices was inevitable which is why we have seen an increase in the prices in the twin cities,” he said.

5,Contemporary art exhibit captures capital’s essence,"Showcases local artists’ evocative works, inventive practices","A vibrant showcase of local contemporary art is currently enchanting visitors in the heart of the federal capital.
The exhibition, titled ‘Earth, Wind, Sky’, curated by the esteemed artist and critic Aasim Akhtar, has been drawing art enthusiasts to the Khaas Contemporary Gallery in Islamabad over the past month.
The show displays a diverse selection of artworks that serve as a window into the local contemporary art scene with creations crafted out of wasli paper and the experimental use of oil paint, metal and gunpowder on paper.
Notably, Tahira Noreen’s wasli art, crafted from precision cutting a special type of handmade paper which she gets custom made from Lahore, reflected the urbanism of art created from within a city setting.
“There’s a focus on lines in my work, their continuity and intentional breaks, each communicates movement in life and specifically, commuting in a city,” Tahira explained while speaking to The Express Tribune.
Some of her works are direct wasli renditions of Islamabad’s infrastructural landmarks such as the Zero Point flyover and its sprawling road networks. Wasli paper is made from layering multiple sheets and has been in use in the Subcontinent since the 10th century. It was especially used in the making of miniature Mughal paintings.
The use of traditional handcrafted paper in artwork that evokes the living development of an expanding urban centre like Islamabad represents the unique potential of Pakistani contemporary art.
The exhibition also featured the works of Maisam Hussain, who uses materials such as metal and gun powder to convey the experience of living in war-impacted regions, and Tahir Zaman, a multidisciplinary artist who captures intricate patterns found in nature by manipulating textures, lights and shadows.
The exhibition, which is still ongoing, has been visited and well received by notable patrons of the arts and personalities such as the ambassadors of Spain and Portugal.
The works of contemporary art are displayed for viewing for free at the Khaas gallery which is situated in Sector F-7. “More people need to be visiting art galleries and engaging with art in Islamabad. It can prove to be a thought-provoking and meaningful activity,” said Sania, the gallery’s assistant curator.
