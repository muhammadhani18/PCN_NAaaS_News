0,Sindh accuses WAPDA of water crisis,Accuses Punjab of misreporting data on apportionment,"During a recent meeting of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) Advisory Committee (IAC), some participants raised concerns about water theft, alleged incompetence of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), and limited snowfall, warning of a potential water crisis this summer.
Sources familiar with the IAC meeting held on Tuesday revealed that the Sindh member of Irsa blamed Wapda for the looming water shortage in the province. It was reported during the meeting that Wapda had failed to complete the Tarbela 5th Extension Hydropower Project or T-5 on time.
Furthermore, it was disclosed that due to the delay in the construction of the T-5 project, 85,000 cusecs of water would not be released. Additionally, the flawed design of the Tarbela Fourth Extension Hydropower Project was said to result in the non-release of 30,000 cusecs of water.
In total, a shortfall of 115,000 cusecs of water from Tarbela dam was expected. Participants were also informed that the supply of 45,000 cusecs of water to Punjab might cease due to the reconstruction of Mangla dam power units.
The IAC was apprised that a 15% theft of water from canals, barrages, and rivers would exacerbate the crisis. It was reported that an estimated 10 million cusecs of water could go to waste in the sea during this Kharif season.
During the meeting, provinces accused each other of providing inaccurate data on water distribution. Sindh accused Punjab of misrepresenting water distribution figures.
Subsequently, Irsa decided to activate its accountability system to monitor water distribution in both provinces. The barrages in Sindh—Guddu, Sukkur, and Kotri—will be monitored by the Punjab Irrigation Department. Similarly, officials from Sindh will oversee discharges at Jinnah, Taunsa, and Panjnad headworks, as well as at Chashma in Punjab.
Moreover, a fact-finding committee will be established to combat water theft.
The IAC meeting, chaired by its chairman and Balochistan member Abdul Hameed Mengal, discussed water availability criteria for the Kharif 2024 season, spanning from April to September. It noted that the water shortfall could reach up to 30% in the upcoming season.

1,K-P to seek royalties to repay loans,"CM’s adviser says govt has prepared its case for demanding royalties, other outstanding dues","The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) government, led by the PTI, has prepared its case for demanding royalties from the federal government for oil, gas, power, and other outstanding dues to repay foreign loans.
Addressing the inaugural ceremony of a sports gala at the Peshawar Press Club, Adviser to the CM on Finance Muzammil Aslam said on Wednesday that the province is burdened with a loan of Rs630 billion.
""We will present our case with evidence before the federal government. If we receive our due share from the federal government, it could provide us with some relief from the loan,"" he added.
Aslam said the province owes a loan of Rs630 billion to foreign lenders and hopes to repay a significant portion of this loan through payments that the federal government is supposed to make to the province.
The adviser highlighted that besides the remaining dues related to electricity, oil, and gas royalties, the province also deserves additional payments due to the increase in its size after the merger of the formerly Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) with it.
Aslam emphasized that a significant portion of the provincial budget is allocated towards pension payments and salaries to government officials. However, he claimed that the provincial priorities are evolving under the leadership of K-P Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.
""We are allocating funds for security, salaries' payments, and then for developmental projects. We are also focusing on increasing the province's revenue. Projects for cheap electricity are underway, and work is being done on some new projects as well.
""We will also hold discussions with the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) regarding electricity supply. There is potential for significant revenue in the fields of minerals, timber, and tourism, on which work is being carried out,"" he added.

2,Gohar rules out alliance with three ruling parties,"Says PML-N, PPP and MQM-P had ‘stolen’ their party’s mandate during the Feb 8 polls","PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan on Wednesday ruled out coalition with three parties –PML-N, PPP and MQM-P – saying these entities had ‘stolen’ their party’s mandate during the Feb 8 polls, therefore, no alliance was possible with them.
Talking to the media outside the Islamabad High Court, the PTI chairman maintained that these parties had only won three of 22 seats in Karachi during the elections.
“The rest were ours. Our 15 seats were given to MQM and four to PPP,” he said. “The number [of votes] was changed by adding one at some places and zero at some other places,” he said.

3,"Pakistani, Indian diplomats clash at UN over Kashmir",Sarwani says Jammu and Kashmir is an internationally recognised disputed territory,"Pakistan hit back at India for claiming Jammu and Kashmir to be its integral part, and rejected the allegation that Pakistan’s representative to the UN misrepresented the forum of the UN Disarmament Commission by raising the Kashmir issue on Tuesday.
Responding to Indian representative remarks during the commission’s general debate, Pakistani delegate Gul Qaiser Sarwani said that Jammu and Kashmir was an internationally recognised disputed territory and Pakistani envoy’s remarks were completely relevant to the work of the commission.
In his speech on the first day of 2024 session, Ambassador Akram highlighted that Kashmiris and Palestinians were among the peoples still denied the right to self-determination. He said that India’s aggressive military policies had turned the security environment in South Asia “volatile and explosive”.
Reacting to Ambassador Akram’s speech, the Indian representative claimed that Jammu and Kashmir was an “integral part’ of India, and accused Pakistan of being involved in terrorism. He also alleged that Pakistan was misusing the forum by raising the Kashmir dispute.
Exercising his right to reply, Sarwani said that repeating a wrong position would not make it acceptable. “Let me reaffirm that Jammu and Kashmir is an internationally recognised disputed territory and is not, by any means, a so-called integral part of India,” Sarwani said.
“Contrary to India’s assertion, the situation in the Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir [IIOJK], India’s massive arms build-up, aggressive posturing, and war-fighting doctrines are completely relevant to the Commission’s work, as they carry grave implications for regional and international peace.”
Sarwani said that his country was facing a significant threat of terrorism, which was orchestrated, supported and financed by its eastern neighbour [India], a well-known state sponsor of terrorism whose terrorist network had gone global, reaching countries far beyond its borders.
He expressed Pakistan’s concerns over India’s emphasis on the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT), which affected Pakistan’s national security interests. He called for flexibility and compromise from all delegations to break the longstanding deadlock in the Conference on Disarmament (CD).
The Pakistani delegate also called on the international community to address attempts to undermine regional peace and security, emphasising their direct impact on prospects for disarmament at both regional and global levels.

4,Filing contempt plea against Punjab IG: Hamad,PTI leader takes a dig at Punjab chief minister,"Taking a dig at Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, PTI leader Hammad Azhar on Wednesday stated that a “woman who never held a job in her life was made the provincial chief of the largest province in the country”.
Addressing a news conference at the Peshawar Press Club, the PTI leader stated that a “half century of terrorism cases” was completed against him. Azhar said he was filing a contempt of court plea against the Punjab IG.
“IG Punjab got a medal for torturing people. My residence was sealed and business closed. The houses of my three sisters were raided,” he said.
“We have to go to other province in pursuit of justice,” he added.
“PPP, which was once an anti-establishment party, has now become their darling.”
The PTI leader said his only “fault” was that he supported party founder Imran Khan.
He asserted that courts were the only option during the current crises facing the country, adding that judiciary should not remain “silent”.
“Inflation has never jumped to 28 per cent even during war and pandemics. The World Bank and IMF have indicated negative growth in GDP,” he added.
With naming Maryam Nawaz, the PTI leader said a “woman who never held a job in her life was made the provincial chief of the largest province in the country”.
“The woman who assumed the role in Punjab, her team is busy in TikTok activities around the clock.”
Azhar said reports regarding attempted poisoning of Bushra Bibi were true.

5,IHC speaks its mind in cipher case,"Observes that Imran, Qureshi did not appear to have revealed classified document in March 27 speeches","A division bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) has remarked that as per its understanding, former prime minister Imran Khan and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had not disclosed contents of a diplomatic cipher in their famous speeches of March 27, 2022.
The bench, comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, made this observation on Wednesday while hearing Imran’s and Qureshi’s appeals against their conviction in the diplomatic cipher case.
On January 30, a special court sentenced the former PM and his FM to 10 years in prison each under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), 1923 for misusing a diplomatic cipher telegram during the final days of the PTI’s government.
During the hearing on Wednesday, Barrister Salman Safdar, the lawyer for the appellants, presented more arguments against the special court’s verdict.
Safdar told the bench that the cipher was never read out in the public rally. He added that the verdict was pronounced before the statement of Qureshi. Both Imran and Qureshi were asked two questions, and immediately afterwards the judgment was announced.
Referring to the judgment, the lawyer said that it had been written that the state’s trust was broken, therefore, the accused did not deserve any leniency. He added that these laws were made for the enemies of the country but had been used against the political adversaries.
Justice Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb remarked that if a foreign state commits something offensive, it could not be revealed because that had come through a cipher, but what if the information was not contained in a cipher, rather came through other usual channels.
If the cipher had come as a diplomatic pouch, could the prime minister bring it forward, he further asked. Salman Safdar replied that there was no recovery of the copy of the cipher from both the appellants, therefore, a wrong case was made and the trial court gave the wrong sentences.
He added that former minister Asad Umar was not charged after he quit politics, while former principal secretary to prime minister Azam Khan, another major character in the controversy, was let off the hook after he gave testimony in the case.
“However, he said, Qureshi was punished because he was not ready to leave the PTI founder,” he said.
Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb also remarked that the trial judge gave the finding in the judgment that Pakistan-US relations were damaged. He asked what was the basis of this finding. Safdar replied that it was written on the basis of the statement of former Pakistani ambassador to US Asad Majeed.
Safdar said that a frivolous prosecution was carried out.
He emphasised that the cipher was not brought forward because it would favour the accused. He termed the prosecution of Imran and Qureshi in the cipher case a mockery of law.
The court said the PTI founder was accused of disclosing secret documents and also losing it. Safdar argued that it was not about losing the cipher, stressing that the cipher was still present in the Foreign Office building.
He said that many copies of the cipher were sent and that the case had been made on the basis of just one copy, while nine other copies of the document were also not returned. He asked why the case was instituted against Imran only.
The bench told Safdar that Imran was also sentenced to two years for not returning the copy of the cipher. If one thing came to him, he should have returned it, but he did not, the bench said, asking the lawyer to argue on that point on Thursday (today) and adjourned the hearing.

6,Chinese firm resumes work on dam project,"PM Shehbaz vowed to put in place ""foolproof"" security arrangements","A Chinese contractor has resumed construction on a major dam site in Pakistan after being provided with extra security, officials said on Wednesday, following a deadly attack on Chinese engineers.
Power China and the China Gezhouba Group Company had halted work on a pair of dam projects last month in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa after a suicide bomber killed five Chinese nationals and a Pakistani driver, causing their van to plunge into a deep ravine.
Hundreds of Chinese people are employed at the Dasu and Diamer-Bhasha dam construction sites, located around 100 kilometres (62 miles) apart in the mountainous region.
Power China resumed work on the Diamer-Bhasha dam on Monday after security was ""significantly increased"", Nazakat Hussain, a spokesman for the project, told AFP.
And a security official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the government hoped to convince the China Gezhouba Group Company to reopen the Dasu dam site next week.
There has been an increase in ""the number of the security officials and also an expansion of patrolling teams"" in the region, he added.
Pakistani police have detained more than 12 people, including Afghan nationals, in connection with the bombing.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited Chinese workers earlier this week, vowing to put in place ""foolproof"" security arrangements and promising ""exemplary punishment"" of attackers.
Beijing is Islamabad's closest regional ally, frequently offering financial assistance to support its often-struggling neighbour and pouring more than billions of dollars into infrastructure projects.

7,K-P concerned over Bushra Bibi’s health,PTI founder had claimed that his wife had been poisoned while being held at the Bani Gala sub-jail,"Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Health Minister Syed Qasim Ali Shah has written a letter to the Punjab chief secretary, expressing concerns over the health of Bushra Bibi, PTI founder Imran Khan’s wife.
A day earlier, the PTI founder had claimed that his wife had been poisoned while being held at the Bani Gala sub-jail, demanding a medical examination for her by a doctor from Shaukat Khanum Hospital.
The letter requested the Punjab government to allow a panel of doctors, including specialists from K-P, for the detailed examination of Bushra Bibi, adding that the check-up would confirm or refute the supply of poisonous food.

8,BHC orders massive relief against inflated gas bills,Bench orders consumers to pay 10% of bills during past three months,"In a landmark ruling, the Balochistan High Court (BHC) has ordered the citizens to pay only 10% of their bills from the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) issued over the past three months, in a bid to address the mounting grievances of the people of Balochistan against excessive billing.
A BHC division bench, comprising Justice Kamran Malakhail and Justice Nazir Ahmed Langove, found that despite assurances from the gas company of fair billing, the situation was dire. The justices gave the ruling with a view to easing the sufferings of the masses.
“It is unjustifiable for the people of Balochistan to bear the brunt of inflated gas bills,” declared Justice Malakhail. “Henceforth, citizens shall only be obligated to pay 10% of the bills issued over the past three months,” Justice Malakhail added.
The courtroom was packed with citizens concerned, eager for respite from the financial strain caused by hefty bills. Renowned lawyers, including Syed Nazeer Agha Advocate, appeared in the case, along with renowned human rights activist and senior lawyer Jalila Haider.
Gas company officials were summoned to account for the staggering bills burdening the populace. Following an hour-long proceedings, the bench gave the ruling that came as relief to many struggling families, who had been grappling with the dilemma of paying exorbitant bills or facing disconnection.
However, the court’s intervention underscored a deeper issue of systemic negligence. Despite repeated admonitions from the court, the gas authorities persisted in imposing unjust charges on the impoverished populace and in instances of non-payment, residents faced punitive measures.
The case was adjourned until April 18, signalling a continued effort by the judiciary to hold accountable those responsible for the economic hardships endured by the people of Balochistan.
