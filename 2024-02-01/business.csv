0,Debt exceeds legal limit by Rs14.5tr,"Finance ministry conceals critical information, violates fiscal laws","An official document reveals that the federal government is carrying a debt burden of Rs14.5 trillion above the statutory limit set by Parliament, poorly implementing the debt management strategy. The skewed Debt Policy Statement 2024 from the Ministry of Finance discloses that during the fiscal year 2022-23, the federal government violated the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act and failed to implement the Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy.
The Ministry of Finance is legally obligated to prepare this statement annually, but amidst a rapid deterioration of the country’s debt situation, critical information is being deleted from the report, compromising transparency. The finance ministry, in comparison to the previous statement, has omitted details regarding the review of public debt, analysis of external public debt inflows and outflows, currency movement and revaluation impact, gross financing needs, and recent updates and developments.
The spokesman of the finance ministry did not respond to whether the instructions to omit details were from the finance minister, finance secretary, or an action of the Debt Policy Office. Despite public declarations of Pakistan’s debt being unsustainable by the finance minister and the International Monetary Fund stating a narrowed path to debt sustainability, crucial information is being concealed from a report intended for the federal cabinet and the country’s parliament.
The Debt Policy Statement evaluates the federal government’s debt policies against the principles of sound fiscal and debt management and the debt reduction path. According to the report, “Pakistan’s Debt to GDP ratio stood at 74.8% at the end of June 2023 compared with 73.9% a year earlier.” Under the law, the Ministry of Finance was required to keep this ratio at 57.5% of GDP, breaching it by an alarming margin of 17.3% of GDP or Rs14.5 trillion.
Exceeding the debt burden by Rs14.5 trillion, standing at Rs62.9 trillion, means the country has virtually nothing in hand after paying the cost of interest on the total debt burden. Under the law, the debt burden should not have exceeded Rs48.5 trillion. During the first half of the current fiscal year, the government paid Rs4.22 trillion in debt servicing costs, surpassing the net income of Rs4 trillion of the Centre, according to the finance ministry.
The report indicates that the total public debt was recorded as Rs62.9 trillion at the end of June 2023. Out of this, domestic debt was Rs38.8 trillion, and external debt was Rs24.1 trillion. The finance ministry attributes the increase in total public debt to higher government borrowing needs to finance the federal fiscal deficit and depreciation of the Pak rupee against the US dollar.

The external public debt was $84 billion at end-June 2023, witnessing a net reduction of around $4.8 billion during the year due to the suspension of foreign loans in the aftermath of disruptions in Pak-IMF relations. The government repaid international commercial bank loans to the tune of $5.9 billion in the previous fiscal year. The inflows from international commercial banks, mainly representing refinancing of maturities, amounted to $3.5 billion. The government also repaid international Sukuk amounting to $1 billion.
Despite these challenges, successive governments have been violating the FRDL Act, which has been amended multiple times. There has not been much focus on addressing the reasons causing higher public debt.
The finance ministry failed to ensure the debt sustainability of the country by reducing currency risks, refinancing risks, and interest rate risks, according to the report. The share of external debt in total public debt increased from 37% in the preceding fiscal year to 38% in the last year, heightening currency risks when the rupee is sinking and foreign countries are reluctant to give loans.
The Debt Policy Statement showed that the average time of maturity of domestic loans significantly worsened, dropping from three and a half years to 2 years and 8 months maturity. This was riskier and would keep the country dependent on commercial banks exploiting the situation. Despite the shortened debt maturity, the finance ministry opted to delete the information of gross financing needs from the Debt Policy Statement.
The finance ministry stated that lower than budgeted external inflows exerted pressure on borrowing from the domestic market. Furthermore, the rising interest rate environment has increased the demand for short-to-medium tenor debt instruments in the domestic market. Resultantly, the average time to maturity of domestic debt decreased, falling below the minimum threshold of 3 years, as stated in the report.
The report also revealed that the average time of maturity of external debt slightly increased from six years and two months to six years and four months. The improvement was mainly due to the retirement of short-term commercial loans, realisation of new external inflows at a longer tenor, and running-off of the external debt portfolio.
The fixed-rate debt also reduced from 26% to 20.4%, increasing interest rate risks, bordering the minimum level of 20%. The government achieved its target of increasing the share of Islamic finance from 8.6% of domestic debt to 9.1%, beating the target.

1,Rupee stays at three-month high,"With uptick, currency has cumulatively surged 9.87%","Pakistani currency on Wednesday hit a new three-month high at Rs279.50 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market, indicating that inflows of the greenback remained higher than the demand.
Dollar supply is relatively better apparently in the wake of increase in workers’ remittances and sales of dollars by exporters on forward counters in the market. According to SBP data, the rupee strengthened 0.02%, or Rs0.05, on a day-on-day basis.
With the uptick, the currency has cumulatively surged 9.87%, or Rs27.60, in the past four months compared to the all-time low of Rs307.10/$ touched in the first week of September 2023.

SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad said on Monday that workers’ remittances and export earnings ,the two major income sources, rose, playing a pivotal role in financing the import of goods and services.
It has been learnt that the government has decided to restrict imports at a level equal to the sum of remittances and export proceeds to manage and keep the current account balance at breakeven level.

2,SBP allows 100% advance import payments,"Liberalisation sparks confidence amid forex reserves surge, traders eye greenback surge","Pakistan’s central bank has allowed commercial banks to make up to 100% import payment in advance without acquiring prior approval, liberalising the import regime after the country’s foreign exchange reserves improved recently.
The softening of trade instructions rules aims to instil confidence in foreign sellers and domestic buyers, potentially easing the hardships faced by traders on imports due to recent low reserves. However, this move may enhance demand for the greenback in the short to medium run.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) directed commercial banks to ensure that advance payments are not misused and remain in compliance with Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) regulations.
The central bank stated that it would hold commercial banks responsible for ensuring imports are made within the given timeframe of 120 to 720 days, depending on the nature of the imported goods. Any delay in import against advance payment would trigger a penalty of 0.1% per day on the importers.
SBP Governor Jameel Ahmed announced on Monday that foreign currency inflows are improving sustainably, helping increase foreign exchange reserves to a six-month high of $8.3 billion at present, up from around $4 billion in June 2023.
Financial experts noted that the current reserves level provides import cover for about two months.
The SBP notification reads that authorised dealers, mostly commercial banks, are henceforth allowed to effect import advance payments with appropriate due diligence, without prior approval of SBP, against irrevocable letters of credit or invoices, up to 100% of the value of the letter of credit or invoice, as the case may be.
The revised instructions are applicable with immediate effect. Import advance payments already made prior to the issuance of these instructions shall be treated “as per previous regulations” issued on the subject.
The amount of the import advance payment shall commensurate with the profile of the customers, the quantity and nature of goods being imported, and the pricing trends prevailing in the international and domestic markets.
Read SBP holds policy rate at record 22%
Dealers need to take necessary measures to examine the transactions and verify the bona fides and genuineness of the beneficiaries to mitigate the risk of any misuse. For this purpose, dealers shall obtain an undertaking from importers and “may seek appropriate collaterals/guarantees from the customers/beneficiaries to safeguard their interests.”
In case the goods against advance payment are not imported and/or the funds remitted in advance are not repatriated for any reason within 730 days in the case of plant and machinery or 120 days in all other cases from the date of advance payment, authorised dealers shall recover an interim penalty at 0.1% per day for the delayed period on the outstanding amounts of advance payment and deposit the same on a monthly basis in favour of SBP.
The SBP directed authorised dealers to establish a monitoring mechanism to ensure that importers do not misuse import advance payments and may take appropriate actions against any delinquent importers, including filing of STRs (suspicious transaction reports) in cases involving TBML (Trade Based Money Laundering), debarring the importer from making any future advance payments, etc.
Dealers shall submit a consolidated statement regarding cases where import has not been effected by the due date or the amount of advance payment is repatriated for any reason.
Another statement containing details of penalties charged, shipments received, and amounts repatriated, if any, against already reported outstanding import advance payments will also be submitted by the given deadline.

4,NEPRA mulls record Rs5.62/unit hike in electricity prices,"Attributed to elevated reference fuel cost, reduced hydropower availability in Dec 2023","The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) has deferred its decision regarding the request from power distribution companies (DISCOs) to raise the electricity price by Rs5.6194 per unit, citing fuel charges adjustment (FCA) for December 2023.
Earlier, the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), at the behest of DISCOs, submitted an application to NEPRA seeking an increase in electricity prices under the FCA for December 2023. NEPRA conducted a public hearing on January 31, 2023 (Wednesday), primarily focusing on the FCA for December.
In its application, the CPPA claimed that the reference fuel cost for December 2023 was set at Rs5.403 per unit, but the actual fuel cost escalated to Rs11.022 per unit. The CPPA also submitted that the total electricity generated with various fuels in December was recorded at 97,726 GWh, priced at Rs10.1341 per unit, resulting in a total energy cost of Rs78,296 million.
During the hearing, NEPRA member, Rafiq Sheikh, inquired about the burden due to the violation of the merit order and the existing system constraints. He questioned the sustainability of the current system, the plans for its continuation, and expressed concerns about persisting issues since the creation of Pakistan. Sheikh sought solutions from institutions, stressing the need for a resolution to the longstanding problems. He noted that the electricity distribution problem had been reported three times in the current month. Either provide a solution or clarify if there is none, with a commitment to finalise the issue of overbilling by electricity companies by March, he urged.
During the hearing, another NEPRA member, Mothar Niaz Rana, said that nuclear power generation had decreased due to the refuelling of nuclear fuel. Simultaneously, the CPPA sought retroactive adjustments totalling over Rs5 billion. NEPRA officials clarified that DISCOs would replace faulty meters by February.
Analysing the breakdown of power generation sources, hydel sources contributed 24.06%, generating 1,859 GWh at zero cost. Coal-fired power plants produced 1,694 GWh (local + imported coal: 1,310+ 384 GWh), constituting 21.92% of the total power generated at a cost of Rs29.5832 per unit.

Similarly, power generation from gas-based power plants was 826 GWh, representing 10.69% of the total generation, with a total cost of Rs14.6035 per unit. The generation from Re-gasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) was 1,268 GWh, accounting for 16.41% of the total generation, priced at Rs33.250 per unit.
Power production from bagasse recorded at 101 GWh, with a calculated price of Rs5.9822 per unit. Electricity generated from wind was 150 GWh, constituting 1.95% of total generation, and solar contributed 62 GWh, accounting for 0.80% of the total generation in December 2023.
Moreover, electricity generation from nuclear sources was 1,464 GWh, priced at Rs1.3162 per unit, representing 18.95% of the total generation. Electricity imported from Iran was 28 GWh, amounting to Rs33.1274 per unit, contributing 0.37% to the total power generation in December.
Data submitted by CPPA with NEPRA revealed that the net electricity delivered to DISCOs in December 2023 was 7,418 GWh (96.02%), at a rate of Rs11.0225 per unit, with a total cost of Rs81,767 million.
It is noteworthy that this marks the highest-ever increase in FCA demanded by CPPA. The proposed higher FCA is mainly attributed to the elevated reference fuel cost and reduced hydropower availability in December 2023. If NEPRA approves the Rs5.62/unit hike in power tariff under FCA for December, consumers will bear the additional cost in their February bills.
As of now, NEPRA has deferred the decision to increase the price of electricity by Rs5.62 per unit under FCA for December, promising a thorough examination of the data. According to NEPRA, the increase in electricity price under FCA for December 2023 will not apply to lifeline electricity consumers or consumers of K-Electric.

5,Stocks notch up gains amid volatility,"KSE-100 index rises 137.44 points, settles at 61,979.18","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday rose modestly in a volatile trading session marred by a lack of encouraging triggers. After swinging back and forth, the KSE-100 index closed with gains of nearly 140 points.
Investor sentiment revived initially but soon volatility gripped the market. However, it picked up momentum with a midday rally owing to substantial stock buying in auto and banking sectors.
Resultantly, the KSE-100 index touched its intra-day high at 62,600.12. But the market’s strength proved short-lived as investors grabbed the opportunity to book profit, pushing the KSE-100 to the intra-day low at 61,896.01. The bourse closed near the 62,000 mark.
“Stocks showed recovery led by selected shares amid higher global crude oil prices, rupee gains and speculation in the earnings season,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“The government’s resolve to settle the power sector circular debt and the status quo in monetary policy despite a high inflation played the role of catalysts in positive close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 137.44 points, or 0.22%, and settled at 61,979.18.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its commentary, noted that there was “some upside relief following four consecutive days of lower close”.
Gains, however, were capped below 63k with the intra-day high at 62.6k, it said. The advancers-to-decliners ratio stood at 36:53 with Engro (+1.36%), Bank Alfalah (+3.1%) and UBL (+1.1%) contributing the most to the market’s advance.
Colgate-Palmolive (-2.79%), Mari Petroleum (-1.41%), and Service Industries (-3.13%) were the biggest downside contributors.

“Price action is expected to have a bearish bias heading into election days with the next draw on liquidity at 59,000 against resistance at 64,000,” AHL added.
JS Global analyst Muhammad Shuja Qureshi said the last day of the month saw the KSE-100 gain 137 points. However, investor sentiment remained weak as turnover dropped. Auto and banking sectors managed to post gains for the day.
Soneri Bank announced a final cash dividend of Rs3 per share and closed limit-up while Sazgar Engineering Works reported 1HFY24 earnings per share of Rs23.40 and rose 6.8%, he added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 276.5 million shares against Tuesday’s tally of 436.1 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs9.3 billion.
Shares of 349 companies were traded. Of these, 165 stocks closed higher, 151 dropped and 33 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 36.3 million shares, losing Rs0.11 to close at Rs4.54. It was followed by The Bank of Punjab with 20.9 million shares, gaining Rs0.4 to close at Rs6.20 and Hascol Petroleum with 14.2 million shares, remaining unchanged at Rs7.91.
Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth Rs585.4 million, according to the NCCPL.

6,Inflation to stay at 28.5% despite ‘economic stabilisation’,Monthly outlook report anticipates inflation to remain around 27.5% in Feb,"Two days after the central bank elevated its inflation forecast, the federal government on Wednesday significantly upwardly revised its projection, stating that inflation may remain around 28.5% in January due to food supply shocks.
In its flagship monthly economic outlook report, the finance ministry anticipates inflation to be around 27.5%-28.5% in January, a 3.5% increase from the previous forecast made a month ago. This adjustment reflects ground realities, indicating no relief in the prices of essential goods and utility items. The report, prepared by the Economic Advisor Wing of the finance ministry, also suggests that the inflation rate may remain around 27.5% in February.
This report follows the central bank’s recent announcement of its monetary policy, which tempered earlier optimism about a sharp decline in inflation in the second half of the fiscal year. Price stability is the central bank’s primary objective under the new autonomy regime, but there is no accountability for missing the goal.
The State Bank of Pakistan appears to attribute the failure to achieve inflation targets to the federal government. It stated on Monday that frequent and substantial adjustments in administered energy prices have impeded the anticipated decline in inflation, affecting near-term outlook. The central bank now expects average inflation to fall in the range of 23%-25% in FY24, a higher range than initially projected and even surpassing the IMF’s forecast.
The finance ministry cites elevated prices of perishables and vegetables, along with increased electricity and gas costs, as contributors to inflationary pressure. The surge in onion export orders following the Indian ban has strained local supply, raising domestic prices. Additionally, severe weather disruptions have led to price hikes for commodities like tomatoes, and reduced chicken supply from controlled sheds facing higher input costs has impacted chicken prices.
Nevertheless, the government has implemented measures to address these challenges, such as increasing the minimum export price for onions and lifting the ban on soybean imports to improve the supply situation for perishables and chicken.
In January FY2024, there is a slight moderation in the inflation outlook compared to the preceding month. While challenges persist in the form of supply chain disruptions and increased utility prices, the decline in fuel costs offers a promising counterbalance, potentially mitigating the overall impact on consumers and production sectors.
Economic Outlook
 
The finance ministry’s report notes that during the first half of this fiscal year, “economic stabilisation” has been achieved through effective measures and prudent policies. Despite challenges, external stability is evident from a surplus in the current account in December. On the fiscal side, revenue performance is encouraging, but there is significant pressure on expenditures due to higher markup payments.

The key challenge is higher markup payments resulting from the high policy rate, leading to a sharp rise in current expenditures, according to the finance ministry. The budget deficit during the first half of the fiscal year widened by over 50%, contradicting claims of achieving fiscal stability. The massive increase in the deficit is primarily attributed to interest costs, as highlighted by the finance ministry.
To address the challenge of higher current expenditures, the government is focusing on controlling non-markup spending through austerity measures, resulting in a rise in the primary surplus during Jul-Dec FY2024. However, mounting markup payments in response to high policy rates are expected to keep expenditures under pressure during the current fiscal year, it said.
The Ministry of Finance expects economic activities to strengthen further during the second half of FY2024, contingent on the continuation of sound and prudent economic policies aimed at achieving the set growth target for the fiscal year. The upward trend is attributed to revived domestic economic activities and better export demand in Pakistan’s main export markets, contributing to external sector stability. The ministry anticipates that ongoing developments and policies to increase exports and remittances will translate into an improved trade balance and current account during the second half of FY2024.
At the domestic level, despite persistent challenges, the industrial sector is showing signs of recovery, and government measures to stimulate growth, particularly in SMEs, are providing impetus. The revival of industrial sector activities is visible in the cyclical LSM pattern for the month of November, reaching the potential level.

7,FBR misses monthly target by 1.3%,"Under IMF arrangement, shortfall of over 1% may necessitate a mini-budget","Sustained performance in income tax collection, coupled with a better show in previous months, has enabled the Federal Board of Revenue to achieve its seven-month target of Rs5.12 trillion. However, for the first time in this fiscal year, the monthly target was missed by Rs9 billion or 1.3%. Under an arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a shortfall of more than 1% may necessitate a mini-budget.
The tax authorities attribute the monthly collection shortfall to the interim finance minister’s drive to restructure the FBR, which they claim shifted focus away from the core goal of meeting tax collection targets.
Provisional collection figures reveal that the FBR has collected Rs5.15 trillion so far, marking a Rs1.15 trillion or 31% increase over the same period in the previous fiscal year.
According to the understanding with the IMF, the FBR must inform the global lender monthly about progress in revenue collection. In case of a revenue shortfall, the FBR is required to implement back-up measures.
Until December, the FBR’s management expressed confidence in achieving the Rs9.415 trillion annual target despite a slump in imports. January witnessed tensions between the tax machinery and the government over the FBR restructuring drive. Although the federal cabinet, on Tuesday, approved the restructuring, the Election Commission of Pakistan immediately halted the process.
In the first seven months (July-January) of the fiscal year, the share of direct taxes increased to 48%, driven by better collection from real estate, commercial banks, and the salaried class. This helped offset losses in other areas, with income tax being the only tax where targets were met.
Income tax collection amounted to Rs2.45 trillion, up by over Rs690 billion or 40% during the first seven months of the current fiscal year. This exceeded the target by about Rs350 billion, compensating for missed sales tax, federal excise, and customs duty targets.
Sales tax and custom duties remained weak areas. Sales tax collection reached over Rs1.76 trillion, which was Rs285 billion or 20% more than the previous fiscal year but Rs240 billion less than the target due to slow growth in tax receipts at the import stage.
The FBR collected Rs306 billion in Federal Excise Duty (FED), reflecting 61% growth, Rs116 billion more than the last fiscal year but Rs5 billion less than the target. Customs duty collection stood below the target by around Rs115 billion, with the FBR receiving Rs628 billion in customs duties, Rs77 billion higher than the previous year.

Monthly Performance
Pakistan committed to the IMF that it would take revenue measures equal to Rs18 billion per month if FBR’s monthly collection falls short of targets. The annual impact of these measures would be Rs216 billion, triggering only in case of revenue shortfalls.
The IMF said that Pakistan remains committed to achieving the primary budget surplus of Rs401 billion during this fiscal year but “this requires some additional effort”. It further stated that “should revenue fall short, the authorities have identified several contingent measures which can be adopted.”
Details show that against January’s target of Rs690 billion, the FBR could provisionally pool Rs681 billion – a shortfall of Rs9 billion. But there was an increase of Rs135 billion or 25% in collection compared to the same month of the last fiscal year.
While the shortfall in monthly collection is not very large, it may not prompt the IMF to call for a mini-budget. Pakistan has already committed to raising the GST rate for textiles and leathers tier-1 from 15% to 18% to collect an additional Rs1 billion per month or Rs12 billion per annum.
The caretaker government has also promised to implement a FED of Rs5 per kilogram on sugar to collect an additional Rs8 billion per month or Rs96 billion annually. It committed to increasing advance income tax on the import of machinery by 1% to collect Rs2 billion per month and increasing advance income tax on the import of raw materials by industries by 0.5% to collect Rs2 billion per month.
Additionally, the government pledged to increase withholding tax on supplies by 1% for Rs1 billion per month revenue, increase withholding tax on services by 1% to collect Rs1.5 billion per month, and increase withholding tax on contracts by 1% to collect an additional Rs1.5 billion per month or Rs18 billion per annum.

8,Govt unveils new tight gas policy,Looks for $20b investment in exploring huge gas reserves,"As part of an ambitious plan to attract investment of $165 billion in oil and gas exploration, the government has unveiled a new tight gas policy that offers higher prices and duty exemptions.
Out of the total investment potential, the government is looking for an investment of $20 billion to explore the untapped tight gas reserves of 35 to 70 trillion cubic feet (tcf).
It is believed that Pakistan has untapped natural gas deposits of 66 tcf with potential investment of $38 billion.
The government also aims to explore the untapped shale gas reserves estimated at 95 tcf as well as offshore gas reserves of 38 tcf with investments of $54 billion and $22 billion, respectively.
It also believes that the country has the untapped potential of 3.6 billion barrels of crude oil, which needs a capital injection of $30 billion.
In a bid to stimulate the exploration and production of tight gas, the government has introduced a comprehensive policy outlining the key provisions for lease terms, price incentives and operational guidelines.
The policy titled “Tight Gas (Exploration & Production) Policy 2024” is aimed at encouraging investment, technological advancements and the efficient utilisation of tight gas resources.
Read Govt eyes major gas policy reforms
The initial term of the development and production lease for tight gas production will be up to 30 years, aligning with the proposed field development plan. Renewal for an additional period, not exceeding 10 years, is possible with justifications deemed acceptable by the government.
If gas reserves extend into a free area, the lease area may be extended to the adjoining free area based on technical justifications.
In cases of discovering tight gas under the existing development and production lease, amendments will be made to include the rights for tight gas reservoirs separately.
Upon expiry of the conventional gas rights, the area held for conventional reserves production will be relinquished, provided it does not impede gas pricing.
To exploit the tight gas reserves, a 40% premium on the zonal price of the Petroleum (Exploration & Production) Policy 2012 will be applicable. This pricing incentive applies to the existing and future exploration licences, petroleum concession agreements, mining leases, and development and production leases, meeting tight gas qualifications under Section 4 of the policy.
