0,Independents can make their own PM if in majority: CEC,"Raja says steps being taken for security of candidates, voters in K-P and Balochistan","Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja on Thursday said it was a constitutional requirement for the independent members to join a political party within three days of winning in the general elections, but if they were in majority, they could also make their own premier.
The CEC, in an informal conversation with media personnel after holding a meeting on the deteriorating law and order situation in the provinces of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, maintained that steps were being taken for the security of candidates and voters.
He added that the meeting on security went well, reassuring that the general elections would be held on the scheduled date of 8th of this month and ruled out the need for any kind of ambiguity in connection with holding the polls.
Raja clarified that it was not within the authority of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to restore internet services in exceptional situations and sensitive areas.
“According to the security agencies, internet services will be available in the country on the election day,” he added.
He continued that the ECP’s Election Management System would work offline if there was any internet service issue.
Terming the security situation in Balochistan and K-P “not normal”, he said the law enforcement agencies were fully committed to their efforts, and the police chiefs of both the provinces had assured the candidates of more security.
The CEC said the PTI should inform the ECP about where it was not being allowed to open their office.
He added that the ECP would open the office for the party in that area. “What can we do if they [the PTI] are not deliberately opening their offices?”
Earlier during the meeting, the CEC conceded that there were security challenges and the safety situation was deteriorating in the two provinces.
According to a statement issued by the commission, the meeting was held at the ECP Secretariat in Islamabad to discuss the deteriorating security situation in the two provinces and its impact on the general elections.
The interim interior minister, interior secretary, chief secretaries as well as police chiefs of K-P and Balochistan, Intelligence Bureau director general; representatives of other agencies, ECP secretary and other senior officers attended the meeting hurriedly called to assess the security situation.
Raja pointed out that ECP offices as well as election rallies were being attacked in the two provinces just a week before the general polls.
However, he clarified that the polls would take place despite terrorism, security challenges, and the events affecting them.
The statement quoted the CEC as saying that foolproof security arrangements were being made for the polls and describing “terrorism as the biggest enemy of the electoral process”.
Raja reiterated that the ECP was fully prepared to hold peaceful polls on their scheduled date, expressing the hope that the law enforcement agencies and Pakistan Army troops would manage the situation.
He expressed full confidence in the law enforcement agencies, saying that they would make all necessary administrative and security arrangements for the peaceful conduct of the general elections.
The CEC continued that elements interfering in the elections and disrupting the security situation would be dealt with strictly, adding that no leniency would be shown to anyone in this connection.
He advised the law enforcement agencies to be wary of attempts by various elements to take the law into their hands, especially during the counting process and announcement of the results.
During the meeting, the interior secretary, chief secretaries and police chiefs of K-P and Balochistan; and representatives of intelligence agencies informed the CEC about all the security as well as administrative measures that had been taken to control the security situation across the country, especially in the two provinces, for peacefully conducting the general elections.
The Balochistan chief secretary and the police chief told the meeting that the provincial administration and security agencies were prepared to combat terrorism.
They briefed the commission about the ongoing operation against the terrorists.
The two officials assured the ECP that no political or non-political force would be allowed to obstruct the electoral process and those who did so would be “dealt with iron hands”.
Similarly, the K-P chief secretary and the police chief highlighted the security measures taken in the province in connection with the elections, while highlighting the threats it faced.
They said that preparations were complete at the administrative level and all resources had already been provided to the law enforcement agencies.
Caretaker Interior Minister Gohar Ejaz said he had returned from a visit to Balochistan where he reviewed the security situation.
He added that the federal and provincial governments would extend their full support and resources to the ECP for conducting the general elections.
“The elections will be held on February 8 come what may.”
The meeting was called just a day after the assassination of a National Assembly independent candidate in Bajaur district of K-P and the killing of an ANP activist in Balochistan’s Qilla Abdullah.
A sudden spurt in violence also saw a grenade attack on the election campaign office of PPP candidate, Ali Madad Jatak, on Quetta’s Sariab Road.
A similar grenade attack was carried out at the residence of another PPP candidate, Mir Zahoor Buledi, in Kech district of Balochistan.
On Tuesday, a bomb blast on a main road in Balochistan’s Sibi area during an election rally led by Saddam Tareen, a PTI-affiliated independent candidate for NA-253 (Ziarat) constituency, left at least four people dead and five others injured.
Ejaz said the attacks taking place in Balochistan were not related to the elections, but were acts of terrorism. He continued that there was no political polarisation in Balochistan.
“Our major challenge in Balochistan is terrorism, and the security agencies are commendably protecting the country.”
Caretaker Information Minister Murtaza Solangi said some elements had been spreading rumours about delaying the elections on the pretext of security and weather issues but the caretaker government was fully committed to conducting the general elections on Feb 8.
Solangi recalled that there were security issues in 2008 and 2013 but the general elections were still held.
Separately, the ECP decided to dispatch the ballot papers for the general elections in some areas of Balochistan and K-P by air to ensure prompt delivery.
“The ballot papers will be airlifted to Gwadar, Panjgur, Kach, Kharan, Bajaur and Kurram Agency,” the ECP spokesperson told APP.
The spokesperson added that the ballot papers would be sent by a helicopter and C-130 to these areas. (With input from APP)

1,"Election violence mars Balochistan, K-P",Grenade attacks and threats before polls stir concern,"As the nation braces for polls on Feb 8, a concerning surge in violence marked by several acts of terrorism has unfolded in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Prominent political figures have also been issued threats. The law enforcement agencies are grappling with the formidable challenge of upholding peace and stability in the region.
On Thursday, one person was killed and five others injured in three separate attacks in Balochistan.
In the first incident of violence, an individual lost his life and another sustained injuries as a blast occurred on Sabzal Road in Quetta.
According to police, unidentified miscreants had planted an improvised explosive device on the roadside, resulting in a powerful explosion that claimed the life of a person on the spot.
Emergency services reached the site of the incident and initiated a rescue operation. The law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area and opened an investigation into the cause of the blast.
Meanwhile, in two separate incidents of violence in the province, four people sustained injuries in two separate hand-grenade attacks in Jaffarabad and Turbat cities.
The first grenade attack occurred in the Ghulam Nabi Chowk area of Turbat, leaving a person injured whereas the other took place on national highway in Dera Allah Yar, Jaffarabad district, leaving three people injured.
The injured were immediately rushed to the hospital for medical assistance.
Following the attack, the security forces swiftly cordoned off the affected sites.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) while expressing deep concern over the terror attacks sought an immediate report from the Balochistan chief secretary and inspector general.
In another episode of violence, unidentified assailants hurled a hand grenade at the office of Mir Nooruddin Nowsherwani, the PPP candidate in Kharan. However, no loss of life was reported.
Similarly, miscreants threw a hand grenade at the office of PML-N on Qambrani Road, Quetta. No casualty was reported.
According to the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD), 15 political figures in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa received threats from extremists in connection with the upcoming general elections.
Releasing a list of such individuals, the CTD maintained that threats had been issued to former National Assembly member Mohsin Dawar, ex-provincial minister Imtiaz Qureshi, Senator Hidayatullah, PML-N’s former MNA Amir Muqam, PTI leaders Pir Musawir Shah and Shah Muhammad, JUI-F’s Malik Adnan Wazir and Ehsanullah.
Senators Bakhti Afsar and Maulana Abdur Rasheed are also threatened by the extremists.
The CTD stated that the police officials of concerned districts have been informed about the threats, and directed for additional security of the listed politicians.
Meanwhile, sit-in and protest against the killing of National Assembly candidate Rehan Zeb continued in Khar Bazaar, Bajaur.
Zeb was shot dead on Wednesday by unidentified assailants while campaigning in Bajaur district’s Sadiqabad Phattak Bazar.
A day earlier, unknown miscreants lobbed a hand grenade at the election office of the PPP on Sariab Road in Quetta, injuring five people. According to police, Ali Madad Jatak, the PPP candidate for the provincial assembly seat in Quetta, was not present at the office at the time of the attack.
Miscreants also threw a hand grenade at the residence of Mir Zahoor Buledi, the PPP’s candidate for a provincial assembly seat in district Kech.
On Tuesday, a bomb blast on a main road in Balochistan’s Sibi during an election rally led by Saddam Tareen – a PTI-affiliated independent candidate for the NA-253 (Ziarat) constituency – left at least four people dead and five others injured.
An ANP activist, identified as Zahoor Ahmed, was killed and another injured when armed men opened fire in the Maizai Addah in Qilla Abdullah district.
ANP Balochistan condemned the incident and demanded that the government should arrest the culprits.

2,The elusive mirage of level playing field,Fairness in electoral races often sacrificed at the altar of power dynamics,"As Pakistan gears up for its 12th general elections, the dream of a ""level playing field"" remains an elusive mirage. The historical pendulum of victimisation and strategic manoeuvring continues to shape electoral outcomes, leaving voters to grapple with the complexities of a political landscape where fairness is often sacrificed at the altar of power dynamics.
In the intricate dance of power dynamics, the hurdles faced by PTI shed light on a historical pattern of political victimisation and strategic manoeuvring.
In the wake of the events on May 9, where PTI supporters face allegations of breaching military installations, the party is confronted with unparalleled difficulties.
Prominent figures such as Imran Khan, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, and Pervaiz Ellahi now reside behind bars. Several influential members are either in hiding or are barred from participating in elections.
The PTI, having been stripped of its electoral symbol ‘Bat,’ now sees its candidates running independently. More than 50 per cent of these candidates are newcomers, a result of widespread defections from the party.
In the absence of the freedom to campaign publicly or on mainstream media, PTI candidates have turned to social media, attempting to navigate an increasingly challenging political landscape. Imran Khan and Shah Mehmood Qureshi were served 10 years in imprisonment on Tuesday under the Official Secrets Act in the cypher case, just days before the polls.
As if this were not sufficient, an accountability court on Wednesday delivered another blow by sentencing Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 14 years in a state gift case, dealing a final blow to the hopes of voters and supporters.
This situation raises questions about the concept of a ""level playing field"" in Pakistan's political history. PTI's predominantly young, middle-class supporters argue that their party is undergoing the worst victimisation in the nation's history, claiming that no other party has faced such adversity. The claims are partially true.
A closer examination of Pakistan's political past reveals a recurrent theme of victimisation, with one party's misfortune often becoming another's patronage. The ebb and flow of power dynamics have seen roles reversed within a short span, with political parties, instead of learning lessons, aligning with powerful establishment to push their opponents into electoral oblivion.
Let's delve into a brief history of instances where the elusive ""level playing field"" was conspicuously absent in every election the country had:
PTI's Rise to Power (2018)
PTI emerged as the choice of powerful quarters, displacing PML-N from favour. Nawaz Sharif faced disqualification and conviction on corruption charges after the Panamagate scandal, paving the way for PTI's ascendancy.
Soon after he came to power in 2013, Nawaz Sharif lost the support of the establishment and was disqualified from office by the Supreme Court and was convicted on corruption charges as a result of Panamagate leaks that highlighted that hundreds of Pakistanis including the Sharif family had parked their money in offshore accounts.
Both the disqualification and conviction have now been overturned by the Supreme Court making elder Sharif a frontrunner for the covet office for the historic fourth time.
The PML-N government was paralysed by Imran Khan and Tahirul Qadri’s protests in 2014 and by TLP in 2017. The most lethal was TLP’s month-long sit-in at Faizabad, one of the main junctions that links the capital Islamabad with other cities.
The sit-in was organised to protest against purported changes in the oath of the members of parliament regarding the finality of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) which TLP claimed was an act tantamount to blasphemy.
Meanwhile, the TLP entered the electoral arena brandishing a hardline religious stance, clinching the fourth-largest vote share in Punjab, the province which decides the fate of elections due to its population size and corresponding number of seats in the National Assembly.
Many electables either switched to other parties, mainly to PTI, or they returned the party ticket and contested as independents and later joined Imran’s party.
Leading up to the 2018 elections, PML-N experienced setbacks in votes, and reputation, and even witnessed attempts on the lives of key leaders. Its law minister Zahid Hamid resigned from the federal cabinet due to pressure from TLP, while Ahsan Iqbal faced an assassination attempt. Nawaz Sharif encountered a shoe being thrown at him during a public function.
Religious decrees against the party were issued, discouraging voters from supporting PML-N. Evidently, this created an uneven playing field for PML-N, leaving the path open for PTI.
PPP's challenges (2013)
In 2013, PML-N assumed power following general elections in which PPP and smaller parties like ANP confronted serious threats from terrorists, hampering their ability to conduct election campaigns freely.
During its 2008-13 term in government, Salman Taseer, PPP’s governor in Punjab, was assassinated by his own official bodyguard in 2011. The assassin claimed the governor was trying to secure the release of a Christian woman who was in jail on blasphemy charges. This action according to the assassin was an act of blasphemy.
Unknown assailants took the life of Shahbaz Bhatti, a Christian member of the PPP cabinet, seemingly in response to his firm stance on blasphemy-related issues. Meanwhile, Hamid Saeed Kazmi, another cabinet member, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt.
To avoid potential backlash from extremist elements, several sitting PPP ministers, including Sherry Rehman, had to go underground. Their efforts aimed at amending legislation to discourage the misuse of blasphemy laws had drawn ire from those opposing the changes.
Election rallies of PPP and ANP were attacked by the terrorists lost a key leader and many workers in one such attack on an election corner meeting in Peshawar.
Such circumstances tilted the playing field in favour of PML-N and PTI, pushing PPP out from Punjab and KPK.
 
PPP at the cost of PML-Q 2008
PPP won the 2008 elections amid the tragic assassination of Benazir Bhutto which engendered a sympathy vote for the party and the declining rule of General Pervez Musharraf as PML-Q was not the first choice of powerful quarters this time.
Besides other factors including inside tussle with powerful quarters, sudden power and gas outrages started in the country just before the election and PML-Q claimed that this was done to curtail the party's vote bank.
PML-Q leadership claimed their party was made to lose the election despite its good performance during the 2002-07 term.
PML-Q's Ascendency (2002)
In 2002, PML-Q assumed power with the support of the establishment, having been established by General Pervez Musharraf through the fragmentation of PML-N. The top leadership of both PML-N and PPP resided in exile, and numerous prominent figures faced corruption charges, which could be absolved if they pledged allegiance to the military ruler.
Despite unfair tactics, PPP and PML-N, though receiving a good number of votes, faced a significant discrepancy in the number of seats secured.
Read: Political parties urged to show economic manifestos
While both PML-Q and PPP secured 26 per cent of the votes, PML-Q emerged as the leader with 78 seats compared to PPP's 63. In contrast, PML-N, despite having 12 per cent of the votes, only managed to secure 15 seats. Additionally, other pro-establishment groups like the National Alliance, with five per cent of the votes, garnered 13 NA seats, and Muttahidda Majlis e Amal (MMA), with 11 per cent of the votes, secured 45 general seats.
Clearly, the electoral field was not favouring both PPP and PML-N at that time.
Embarking on a journey through Pakistan's electoral history's early years, one encounters twists, turns, and recurring themes of political manoeuvring throughout its chequered history.
 
1956: The Inception of Constitutional Experimentation
Nine years post-independence, Pakistan witnessed the adoption of its first constitution, establishing a parliamentary form of government with executive powers vested in the prime minister. The president, the head of the state, was to be elected by members of the National and provincial assemblies.
Despite East Pakistan's demographic majority, the National Assembly's representation allocated half the seats to the province, sparking claims of underrepresentation.
However, the constitutional journey faced a detour as the first general elections slated for February 1959 were pre-empted by a coup d'état in October 1958. General Ayub Khan seized power, ushering in his own constitution and a shift to a presidential form of government. The subsequent elections in 1964 bore witness to rampant rigging, securing Ayub's continued rule.
1970-1977: Electoral Turmoil and Manipulations
The year 1970 marked the first general elections under martial law, introducing universal adult franchise. Awami League, the popular party of East Pakistan, faced adversity from powerful quarters from West Pakistan. The elections of December 1970, held under the second martial law, were marred by allegations of suppression. Awami League Chief Sheikh Mujeebur Rahman was behind bars on sedition charges.
In 1977, the founder of the PPP, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, advanced the elections almost a year ahead of schedule. The opposition parties claimed delimitations favoured PPP, and state resources were exploited for electoral gains. The elections, characterised by large-scale manipulations, left even Bhutto astonished at the results.
Chief Election Commissioner Justice Sajjad Ahmed acknowledged widespread manipulations, denying a level playing field to opposition parties.
1985: Non-Party Based Elections Under Military Rule
During General Zia-ul-Haq's military rule, the 1985 elections took a different course, being non-party-based. The PPP boycotted the polls, citing mistrust in the process, and the political landscape grappled with unique dynamics under military oversight.
1988: The Demise of Zia and the Birth of IJI
The 1988 elections, following the death of General Zia-ul-Haq, witnessed the formation of the nine-party alliance named IJI to counter Benazir Bhutto's PPP. Propaganda campaigns and last-minute changes, such as the mandatory national identity card for voting, were aimed to favour IJI. PPP secured 93 seats against IJI's 54, highlighting a shift in political dynamics.
1990s: A Decade of Shifting Alliances and Power Dynamics
After then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Benazir Bhutto’s nascent government in August 1990, he appointed Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi who was head of IJI in 1988 elections as caretaker prime minister.
In Sindh, the stronghold of PPP, Jam Saddiq, another known anti-PPP politician was appointed as caretaker chief minister.
Meanwhile, millions of rupees were doled out from the national exchequer to favour component parties of former IJI. This was proven in the Supreme Court in the Asghar Khan case. The decision came in 2012 decades after what was done back in 1990 to deny the PPP a level playing field. The PML-N-led alliance secured 105 seats against Benazir Bhutto-led Pakistan Democratic Alliance’s 45.
Within three years the roles were changed again. Nawaz and Ishaq Khan who was a representative of the establishment fell out on the issue of the appointment of a new army chief after the sudden demise of General Asif Nawaz due to heart attack.
Benazir Bhutto joined hands with the establishment and sent Nawaz packing in 1993. Her husband who was in jail on corruption charges, became part of the interim cabinet. PML-N which was contesting previous elections on the symbol “Bicycle” was denied its election symbol and was allotted a tiger as the new symbol.
Then popular PML-N lost the election bagging 56 general seats against PPP’s 65.
The Benazir Bhutto-led PPP government did not last long either. Bhutto’s confidant President Farooq Leghari dismissed her government in November 1996.
Benazir Bhutto, along with her husband Asif Ali Zardari and numerous other prominent members of their party, confronted corruption charges.
Rather than concentrating on election matters, they found themselves entangled in legal battles, striving to evade potential convictions under recently introduced accountability laws, which appeared to be selectively wielded against those out of favour with powerful entities at that time.
The establishment’s favourite PML-N returned successfully in the February 1997 elections bagging a “heavy mandate” of 137 general seats against PPP’s 18, out of 203 directly elected seats for the National Assembly.
PPP alleged PML-N of worst victimization. Benazir went on self-exile while Zardair was incarcerated on corruption charges.
1999: The Fateful Military Coup and PML-Q's Emergence
Not a year had passed when PML-N developed differences with powerful quarters. On November 28, 1997 PML-N supporters stormed the Supreme Court building to avoid possible contempt of court. This heavy-mandate government of Nawaz Sharif was sacked in October 1999 in a military coup when Sharif attempted to replace army chief General Perez Musharraf and appointed General Zia Uddin Butt as the new army chief.
Nawaz Sharif and many others faced imprisonment, only to be released when they signed a covenant with the establishment not to return to Pakistan for the next ten years. A new party PML-Q was created breaking PML-N into pieces which contested the 2002 polls as the king's party.
As Pakistan navigates the intricate tapestry of its electoral history, the recurring theme of shifting alliances, power struggles, and accusations of manipulation continues to shape the nation's democratic narrative. The complexities of the past echo in the present, leaving citizens to ponder the elusive pursuit of a truly ""level playing field"" in their political journey.

3,Uptick in poll-related violence prompts ECP huddle,Violent attacks continue to mar the elections campaigns in various parts of the Balochistan,"The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday summoned an urgent meeting of security officials following the assassination of a National Assembly independent candidate in Bajaur district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and the killing of an ANP activist in Balochistan’s Qilla Abdullah.
A sudden spurt in violence -- just eight days before the general elections -- also saw a grenade attack on the election campaign office of PPP candidate, Ali Madad Jatak, on Quetta’s Sariab Road. A similar grenade attack was carried out at the residence of another PPP candidate, Mir Zahoor Buledi, in Kech district of Balochistan.
A day earlier, a bomb blast on a main road in Balochistan’s Sibi during an election rally led by Saddam Tareen, a PTI-affiliated independent candidate for NA-253 (Ziarat) constituency, leaving at least four people dead and five others injured.
The ECP told the media in Islamabad that it would meet with government and intelligence officials on Thursday (today) to discuss the worsening law and order situation in the two provinces.
In K-P, Rehan Zeb, an independent for NA-8 constituency, was shot dead by unknown assailants, while campaigning in Bajaur district’s Siddiqabad Phattak Bazar at around noon time, according to the local po- lice. Zeb was among four people injured in the shooting. He suffered bullet wounds to his head and neck. He was rushed to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Khar in a serious condition, where he succumbed to his injuries.

Zeb sought to contest the election with the PTI’s support, but the party decided to support an- other candidate.
However, Zeb decided to contest the elections as an independent candidate. After the incident, elections for NA-8 and the provincial assembly constituency of PK-22 have been postponed.
In Balochistan, violent attacks continued to mar the elections campaigns in various parts of the province. One person was killed and five others sustained injuries in three firing and grenade attacks, the police and party officials said.
An ANP activist, identified as Zahoor Ahmed, was killed and another injured when armed men opened fire in the Maizai Addah in Qilla Abdullah district. The injured were rushed to a hospital, where the ANP activist breathed his last.
The ANP Balochistan condemned the incident and demanded that the government should arrest the culprits.
In another incident, unknown miscreants lobbed a hand grenade at the election office of the PPP on Sariab Road in Quetta, injuring five people. According to police, Ali Madad Jatak, the PPP candidate for the provincial assembly seat in Quetta, was not present at the office at the time of the attack. In a third untoward incident, miscreants lobbed a hand grenade at the residence of Mir Zahoor Buledi, the PPP’s candidate for a provincial assembly seat in district Kech.
However, there was no report of any loss of lives. The attackers escaped from the spot.

4,Buckle up motorists: petrol surges by Rs13.55,Diesel rate also goes up by Rs2.75 for Feb 1-5 fortnight,"The government on Wednesday implemented a significant hike in petrol prices by Rs13.55 per litre for the fortnight starting February 1-15.
This increase primarily aims to cover elevated taxes for current expenditures and address the surge in global oil prices.
Additionally, the price of high-speed diesel (HSD) rose by Rs2.75 per litre, as stated by the finance ministry. Following this adjustment, petrol will now be priced at Rs272.89 per litre, up from Rs259.34, while diesel will cost Rs278.96 per litre, up from Rs276.21.
Petrol is predominantly utilized in motorbikes and cars, while diesel is essential in the transport and agriculture sectors. Fluctuations in the price of High-Speed Diesel (HSD) directly affect consumers, leading to inflationary pressures. With gas load-shedding affecting the CNG sector in February, petrol, often an alternative, is expected to witness high demand.
In Punjab, there is no indigenous gas available for the CNG sector for several years and the entire CNG sector is supplied imported gas. The CNG outlets in other provinces also face load-shedding due to gas shortages in the country.

“The government of Pakistan has decided to bring changes in the current prices of petroleum products during the fortnight starting from 1st February 2024, as recommended by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA),” the finance ministry said in the statement.
Pakistan is a net importer of petroleum products, therefore, premium on oil imports also reflects in the prices. Import premium on petrol is estimated at $9.47 per barrel, whereas, the premium on HSD has been estimated to increase to $6.50 per barrel from $5.30 per barrel.
In the international market, the price of Brent had gone up by $5 per barrel to $83 from $78 per barrel on January 16. The HSD has also become costlier by about $2 per barrel to $97 from about $95 per barrel during the same period.
At present, the government is charging higher rate of petroleum levy on petroleum products up to Rs60 per litre. Therefore, the key reason of higher oil prices in Pakistan was the higher taxes, which the federal government was collecting to meet current expenditures.
The Russia and Ukraine war was also another reason that had led to higher oil prices in the international market that affected the prices on domestic level.

5,Lower Sindh’s electoral battles to watch out for,"PPP, GDA, MQM-P emerge as frontline contenders in Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas divisions","Fierce electoral contests are underway in multiple constituencies spanning the four districts of Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas divisions, encompassing the ""Laar"" region of the province, featuring a total of 18 National Assembly and 39 Sindh Assembly seats.
While the number of closely contested seats remains relatively low in this region, key contenders include the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P).
Additionally, candidates from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan (JI), Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) are actively campaigning in these divisions.
The battleground, though varying in intensity across constituencies, is particularly fierce in Hyderabad,
Badin, Mirpurkhas, and Tharparkar districts. These areas collectively hold 9 National Assembly and 19 provincial assembly seats, with a total of 3,756,314 registered voters.
In the absence of reliable electoral surveys, the attendance at public rallies and meetings serves as a key indicator of a party's popularity.
HyderabadThe electorate of the second largest city of Sindh has always appeared divided along ethnic lines since the 1988 general elections. The Urdu-speaking population, which inhabits in City and Latifabad Talukas, used to elect the representatives from the MQM-P. The inhabitants of Qasimabad and Hyderabad Talukas, meanwhile, always went with the PPP’s candidates.
However, the 2018 elections witnessed a maiden blow to that three-decade long divide, when a PPP candidate, Abdul Jabbar Khan, defeated MQM-P’s candidate in Latifabad on a Sindh Assembly seat. Observers credited an split in the MQM-P’s voters, and the emergence of a new vote bank for the PTI, as the reasons behind the PPP’s inroad into MQM-P’s erstwhile stronghold.
Currently, an electoral combat is unfolding on three National Assembly and six Sindh Assembly seats in the district that boasts of 1,225,147 votes – 662,713 male and 562,434 female.
In view of the 2018 election results, the rejuvenated MQM-P will be defending its victory on two seats of the National Assembly and three of the Sindh Assembly and the PPP on one National Assembly and three Sindh Assembly.
With the PTI facing obstacles in its path to election campaigning, a three-way contest which played out in 2018, is likely to turn into a direct electoral battle between two major parties.
Nevertheless, six of the constituencies like NA-218, NA-219, PS-60, PS-61, PS-63 and PS-65 will arguably remain immune to the prevailing political tension. On the City taluka-based NA-220, MQM-P’s former MNA Syed Waseem Hussain will be defending his party’s stronghold against PPP’s Waseem Rajput.
The PS-64, which falls under NA-220, is also set to see a contest between MQM-P’s Rashid Khan and PPP’s Mukhtiar Ahmed alias Aajiz Dhamra. On PS-62 in Latifabad, PPP’s former MPA from the constituency Abdul Jabbar Khan is pitted against MQM-P’s Sabir Hussain Qaimkhani, a strong candidate who was elected MNA from Latifabad in 2018.
BadinIn the agriculture and oil rich coastal district of Badin which is home to five sugar industries albeit with rampant poverty, the PPP is confronted with the party’s dissidents former Sindh home minister Dr Zulfiqar Mirza, his wife former National Assembly Speaker Dr Fehmida Mirza and their sons.

From the platform of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), the Mirza family caused upsets for the PPP in 2018 when Dr Fehmida Mirza and her son Hasnain Ali Mirza were elected as MNA from NA-230 Badin and MPA from PS-72, respectively.
The Mirzas began to wage an electoral war against their party since 2015 local government elections when they bagged close to half seats of the local bodies.
However, according to the local observes, the spirit of the past two elections seems missing in the ongoing campaign of Mirzas with both Dr Zulfiqar and Dr Fehmida out of the electoral combat.
The nomination forms of the couple were rejected on the basis of their alleged bank default. When the Sindh High Court restored their forms, the process of allocating election symbols was already completed with the GDA’s symbol ‘star’ given to their sons.
The couple, mainly Dr Zulfiqar, is now campaigning for their sons Hasnain, a former MPA, and Hassam Mirza. The former is running from PS-70 Badin-III and the latter from NA-223 and PS-71 Badin-IV. The district, with 942,176 voters has two constituencies of the NA and five of the PS.
MirpurkhasIn Mirpurkhas district the PPP is facing a two-fold electoral attack—from MQM-P and an independent candidate Syed Ali Nawaz Shah, a former PPP stalwart and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s associate elected to the Senate, National and Sindh assemblies multiple times since 1977.
The district has two seats of the National Assembly and four of the provincial assembly with 865,400 voters. In 2018, Shah as an independent candidate defeated the PPP’s opponent on NA-218 Mirpurkhas-I with the support of MQM-P, GDA and other parties. He is again standing for the same seat, renamed as NA-211 Mirpurkhas-I, against PPP’s Pir Aftab Hussain Shah Jilani.
The PPP will also have to deal with Shah and his son, Syed Shuja Muhammad Shah, on PS-47 and PS-46, respectively, though the party had managed to win those two seats in 2018. Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah and Noor Ahmed Bhurgari, both elected MPAs in 2018, will face off Shahs on PS-46 and PS-47.
Mirpurkhas city based constituency, PS-45 Mirpurkhas-I, has in the past elected MQM-P’s candidates five times since 1993. But in 2018 the PPP’s Hari Ram Kishori Lal grabbed that constituency for the first time in decades. In the upcoming polls, Zafar Ahmed Khan Kamali, who was elected MQM-P’s MPA from that seat in 2013, will try to reclaim his lost constituency from PPP’s Lal.
Son of former Sindh chief minister Arbab Ghulam Rahim, Arbab Inayatullah, is standing for PS-48 against the PPP’s Mir Tariq Ali Talpur, who was elected MPA in 2018 from the same area.
Tharparkar
The GDA, represented by former chief minister Arbab in Tharparkar, posed a tough challenge to the PPP in 2018. The party managed to secure only one provincial seat out of two seats of National Assembly and four of provincial assembly in that district. Arbab is again leading a strong campaign for his party, besides being himself a candidate for NA-215 Tharparkar-II.
But the GDA has changed its winning candidate for PS-52 Tharparkar-I Abdul Razzak Rahimo by giving the ticket to Sher Khan Samejo this time. Rahimo has been elevated to fight for NA-214 Tharparkar-I against Pir Ameer Ali Shah Jeelani, whose father late Pir Noor Muhammad Shah Jillani had won that seat in 2018. Ameer had succeeded his father after his death in a by-election.
Arbab Anwar Jabbar, Arbab Togachi, Fawad Razzaque and Arbab Zakaullah of the GDA have joined the electoral fray against the PPP’s Qasim Soomro, Sher Muhammad Bilalani and Arbab Lutfullah on PS-53, PS-54 and PS-55, respectively. All these PPP’s candidates had won in 2018 from their constituencies.
