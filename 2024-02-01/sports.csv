1,K-P hastily selects 16 vice-chancellors,"Caretaker setup conducts 160 interviews in 5 days, finalises recommendations within 1","The urgency within the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Higher Education Department to appoint vice chancellors for the 16 public sector universities across the province is palpable, as evident from the expedited interview process involving 160 candidates over the past five days. 
Under the caretaker government, there’s a concerted effort to finalize recommendations for these appointments within a single day, driven by a looming deadline—the end of the caretaker government’s tenure on February 8.
Reliable sources told The Express Tribune a sense of vested interest within the caretaker setup is evident, aiming to install their preferred candidates in these crucial positions. The swift pace of the selection process, with decisions already made but names kept under wraps, has sparked widespread suspicion regarding the transparency and integrity of the entire selection process.
Against this backdrop, it is imperative to reflect on the broader context of reforms within the higher education sector in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Last November, the Caretaker Chief Minister, Justice (retd) Syed Arshad Hussain Shah, convened a meeting at the Chief Minister House, signaling intent to addressing the myriad challenges plaguing universities across the province.

Key officials, including Caretaker Provincial Minister for Higher Education Dr. Qasim Jan and Caretaker Minister for ST&IT Dr. Najeebullah, deliberated on a range of issues, from financial sustainability to the quality of education and research initiatives.
Central to these discussions was the recognition of the financial crisis afflicting universities, attributed in part to superfluous appointments and excessive staffing. The urgent need to halt this trend was emphasized, reflecting a broader imperative to ensure the fiscal viability and long-term sustainability of higher educational institutions. To this end, a committee, led by the minister for higher education, was proposed to oversee the formulation and implementation of key decisions and proposals arising from the meeting, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders.
Moreover, the meeting underscored the critical importance of appointing vice chancellors with not only impeccable credentials and legal compliance but also demonstrable administrative acumen. The activation of a search committee on an emergency basis was ordered by the caretaker chief minister, highlighting the urgency of filling these leadership vacancies with individuals capable of steering universities through these tumultuous times.
Beyond administrative reforms, there was a strong emphasis on fostering a culture of research excellence aligned with international standards and market demands.

In October last year, a committee was formed to ensure the reusability of free textbooks and prevent wastage. District Level Constituent Committees (DLCC) will oversee this initiative, comprising four members each. They will be responsible for protecting books from damage, making them reusable, and redistributing them to students. This measure aims to curb the unnecessary expenditure on printing new books annually, ensuring that once-used books are reused efficiently.
Each district-level committee will be led by a Chairman, typically a District Education Officer (DEO), with members including Deputy DEOs (DDEOs), Assistant DEOs (ASDEOs), and a representative from the District Management Office (DMO). 
They will coordinate with school principals and teachers for the presentation, collection, and redistribution of textbooks. Monthly meetings with stakeholders and random inspections of textbooks at schools will be conducted, with reports submitted for evaluation.
