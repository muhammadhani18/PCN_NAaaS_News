0,‘Cipher’s was an open-and-shut case’,Special Court declares that Imran Khan violated his oath by unveiling a classified information,"The Special Court which on Tuesday convicted former prime minister Imran Khan and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has declared that disclosure of a diplomatic cipher by the PTI’s leaders “adversely affected” Pakistan and benefited foreign powers.
""It is quite clear from the evidence brought on record that by compromising the integrity of the cipher communications system of Pakistan, the accused, Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, in connivance with the accused, Shah Mehmood Qureshi has compromised Pakistan's international standing…
“[They have also undermined], the credibility and standing of our diplomats and diplomacy with adverse implications for our future diplomatic reporting culture,” said the written verdict issued by the Special Court Judge Abual Hasnat Muhammad Zulqarnain on Thursday.
The judge on Tuesday sentenced both Imran and Qureshi to ten years in prison at the conclusion of a trail based on allegations that the former PM and foreign minister misused and later misplaced a diplomatic telegram ahead of a no-confidence motion against their government in March 2022.
The verdict said Pakistan clearly faced consequences of this disclosure of the telegram
“It is evident that Pakistan has faced serious economic, diplomatic and political consequences due to the offences committed by the accused Imran and Qureshi, which in turn weakened Pakistan's economy thus, adversely affecting the national security.”
The judgement noted that it was an open-and-shut case in which receipt of the cipher message along with chain of custody was proved through tangible evidence supported by cipher movement registers.
“Moreover, in the light of the statement of Azam Khan, the then Secretary to the PM, unauthorized retention of [the] cipher even after his advice [and] negligent handling of [the] telegram containing [the] cipher message is also proved.”
It said there were statements of three witnesses other than the investigation officer which said that disclosure of the cipher had adverse effects. “[The] learned prosecutors relied upon statements of Mr Asad Majeed, the then ambassador [to the US], Sohail Mehmood, ex-foreign secretary and Faisal Niaz Tirmizi,” it added.
The verdict said the former prime minister did not deny that he waved the telegram at a public rally on March 27, 2022 and disclosed its content before the public at large.
“[The] factum of benefit to foreign power is to be evaluated in the light of attending circumstances and this fact is to be inferred, they emphasized the word “calculated” used in the relevant provision,” it said.
The verdict said there falls a heavy responsibility on the prime minister as he becomes privy to the most confidential information concerning the state.
“The Constitution requires a person occupying the high office of the Prime Minister to act in the most responsible manner and absolutely refrain from doing anything which undermines the interests of Pakistan.
“Sadly, the accused Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, besides committing offences under the Official Secrets Act, 1923 has also violated his oath,"" the order said.
The court also took exception to the “tricky” behavior adopted by Imran and Qureshi during the trial.
Discussing their conduct, the judge noted both the accused were represented through a number of lawyers but during the entire proceedings they played hide and seek just to prolong the proceedings.
“They just played hide and seek and considered the entire proceedings in a [mocking] manner which is not warranted by law and twisted their various stances by way of filing different applications just in order to protract these proceedings,” it added.

1,UN report reveals TTP set up new base in K-P,Says 66 terrorists were trained as suicide bombers over there,"The outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) established a new base in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) in mid-2023, revealed a new UN report, which sheds light on close ties between not only the TTP and the Afghan Taliban but also the anti-Pakistani groups and al Qaeda.
The 33rd report compiled by the UN Monitoring Team was submitted to the UN Security Council last week providing details about the presence of terrorist organisations in Afghanistan and their linkage with the Kabul regime.
“A new TTP base was established in mid-2023 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, where 66 TTP individuals trained as suicide bombers,” the 23-page report read.
It was important to highlight that the new base was established merely months after Pakistan allowed hundreds of TTP terrorists to return as part of the confidence-building measure.
It was evident that the returning TTP terrorists instead of laying down arms regrouped and posed a greater threat to Pakistan’s security.
The increased TTP attacks prompted authorities to withdraw from the peace efforts brokered by the Afghan Taliban.
“[The] TTP was further strengthened and emboldened, increasing attacks with a broader degree of autonomy to manoeuvre,” the UN report said.
“The Taliban are generally sympathetic to TTP aims,” it further said, corroborating evidence on the ground that the TTP and the Afghan Taliban are two sides of the same coin.
Another revelation made in the report is the close nexus between the TTP and al Qaeda.
“Besides supplying weapons and equipment, Taliban rank and file, al Qaeda core and AQIS fighters assisted the TTP forces in cross-border attacks,” the report noted.
Despite Taliban instructing the TTP fighters not to participate in operations outside Afghanistan, many had done so with no apparent consequence, according to the report.
The report further revealed that some Taliban members also joined the TTP, perceiving a religious obligation to provide support.
Interlocutors reported that the TTP members and their families receive regular aid packages from the Taliban.
Also importantly, the UN report said a notable development was the increase of Afghan nationals in the TTP ranks. This endorsed Pakistan’s stance that an increasing number of Afghan nationals were involved in suicide attacks in the country.
The report also noted that the relationship between the Taliban and al Qaeda remained close, and the latter maintained a holding pattern in Afghanistan under the Taliban patronage.
“Regional states assess that the presence of al Qaeda’s senior figures in the country has not changed and that the group continues to pose a threat in the region, and potentially beyond.”
The al Qaeda was reported to have established up to eight new training camps in Afghanistan, including four in Ghazni, Laghman, Parwan and Uruzgan provinces, with a new base to stockpile weaponry in the Panjshir Valley. Some camps might be temporary.
Hakim al-Masri (not listed), based in Kunar province, is responsible for the training camps and conducting suicide bomber training for the TTP.
The UN report further said al Qaeda core and AQIS continue to provide training, ideological guidance, and support to the TTP.
In July 2023, al Qaeda reportedly issued orders for all vehicles used by the group to be gifted to the TTP owing to fear of being targeted by the United States of America. With the consent of senior al Qaeda leaders, AQIS selected approximately 15 commanders to assist the TTP with attacks in Pakistan.
In September, AQIS reportedly supplied armed fighters during the TTP attack in Chitral, Pakistan. The TTP morale increased following international attention on the September attack. Aside from anti-Pakistan operations, the TTP reportedly conducts assassinations of Taliban defecting to ISIL-K.
It also said the short-term detention of 70 to 200 TTP members and the relocation of personnel northward away from the border areas by the Taliban were assessed as deflecting pressure from Pakistan to contain the TTP.
Similarly, the report revealed that a newly formed Tehreek-e-Jihad Pakistan (TJP) is a front, providing the TTP with plausible deniability, to alleviate the pressure from Pakistan on the Taliban.
The TJP conducted several attacks in 2023, including one against Pakistani security forces in K-P on Dec 12, 2023.
The report said regional states expressed continuing concern for its collaboration with other terrorist groups, especially the TTP, in recruitment, training, planning attacks and posing a regional threat.
One member state reported al Qaeda core providing training and ideological guidance to ETIM/TIP.
Another member state, according to the report, assessed the strength of Majeed Brigade (MB) at 60 to 80 fighters, with recruitment focusing on female suicide bombers.
A couple of member states reported MB cooperation with the TTP and the ISIL-K in training, weapons acquisition, intelligence-sharing and joint operations, although several other member states sought additional information in this regard.
The MB claimed several attacks targeting Pakistan’s law enforcement agencies and Chinese personnel in Pakistan during the reported period.Pakistan reacts to UN report
At a weekly news briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said Pakistan had been raising concerns that the terrorist groups and entities threatening the country had found refuge in Afghanistan.
“We are concerned that these groups and entities have a free hand to attack Pakistan, and to sponsor terrorist activities inside Pakistan,” she said.
“And we urge Afghanistan to take immediate and effective action against these terrorist entities, hand over their leadership to Pakistan, and those individuals who have been involved in terrorist activities inside Pakistan.
“We have shared concrete evidence with regards to their involvement with the Afghan authorities.”

The AAC has also demanded 80% royalty of Diamer-Bhasha Dam under net hydel profit should be given to the people of G-B, ensuring electricity supply to its residents as well as an end to the 22-hour power outage in the region.
According to the agenda, the ECC will also review the demand and supply situation of wheat in the country in detail.
The meeting is also expected to approve the technical supplementary grant of Rs500 million for the Civil Aviation Authority. The grant will be spent on the modernisation of Pakistan Meteorological Department’s (PMD) hydro-met services.

The meeting is likely to approve the summary of a technical supplementary grant from a Japanese endowment for the construction of the flood-affected roads in the rural areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and the project of providing clean drinking water to the three union councils of Lahore.
The ECC will also consider the summary of providing additional funds of more than Rs1.59 billion to the finance ministry for consultancy services and recruitment of consultants for the current financial year.
The summary of the technical supplementary grant of Rs7.5 billion for federal education and professional training will also be discussed.
The participants of the meeting will further consider two summaries of technical supplementary grants of more than Rs560 million for the housing and works ministry.
A technical supplementary grant of Rs4 billion will also be approved for the 7th Population and Housing Census.
The ECC will consider the summary in connection with giving cover to the local currency related to the difference in the value of the dollar and rupee for the use of budgetary foreign aid during the current financial year.

3,PTI to hold intra-party polls on Feb 5,Says results will be announced on Tuesday,"The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has formally unveiled the official timetable for its intra-party elections, which are scheduled to be held on Feb 5 (Monday) – three days ahead of the general elections.
In an official statement issued on Thursday, the PTI Federal Election Commission expressed its satisfaction in disclosing the election schedule for the intra-party elections of PTI, designed to elect the chairman, central, and provincial organisations.
As per the PTI announcement, individuals who have been party members up to Jan 31 shall be entitled to cast their votes for their favoured panel or chairman candidate at specified locations throughout Pakistan. Additionally, the party members can exercise their voting rights through the 'Raabta Application Intra-Party Election Module'.
The comprehensive details concerning all participating panels in the intra-party election, as well as the intricate election procedure, are elucidated in the Election Rules, 2020.
These rules will be made accessible on the party's official website and the Raabta application.
The polling period is scheduled to commence at 10am and conclude at 4pm. The specific election venues and the appellate tribunal's date will be disclosed before the intra-party elections.
Further, the PTI has announced that nomination papers for prospective candidates can be obtained from the PTI Central Secretariat or the official website between Feb 1 and 2, 2024. The final date for the submission of nomination papers is set for Feb 2, 2024, until 10pm.

The official proclamation of the intra-party election results is earmarked for Tuesday, Feb 6, 2024.
The move to practice the exercise again comes as the Supreme Court on Jan 13 upheld the Dec 22 decision of the Election Commission of Pakistan of declaring the intra-party elections held on Dec 2 null and void, depriving the party of the bat as its election symbol.
The party had moved the Peshawar High Court which through an interim order on Dec 26 suspended the ECP ruling.
However, the decision was challenged by the electoral body and the high court reversed its ruling on Jan 3.

4,‘Too late’: SC nixes appeal in nomination papers case,Three-member bench cites delay in approaching court as ballot papers have already been published," 
The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed an appeal challenging the rejection of nomination papers for a candidate from PP-244 Bahawalnagar constituency in the Punjab Assembly, citing the publication of the ballot papers.
A three-member bench, led by Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, heard the appeal filed by Malik Muzaffar Khan. The petitioner's counsel argued that the rejection of the nomination papers was illegal.
The court, however, declared that the petitioner had delayed approaching the Supreme Court for review. It noted that if the decision of the election tribunal had been challenged promptly, relief could have been granted.
Special Secretary of the Election Commission Zafar Iqbal informed the court that over 260 million ballot papers were printed for national and provincial constituencies. The large number of candidates necessitated the use of 2400 tons of paper for the ballot papers, with the printing process now concluded.
Interestingly, a day earlier, another three-member bench headed by Justice Muneeb Akhtar ordered the approval of nomination papers for Sardar Shehbaz Siyal from NA-144 Khanewal, directing the allocation of an election symbol. This decision contradicted the dismissal of the appeal regarding PP-244, citing the publication of ballot papers.

In its order, the court rejected the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) excuse regarding the publication of nomination papers, stating it was unacceptable.
Justice Muneeb Akhtar acknowledged the challenges faced by the ECP, but said that the court had to balance the difficulties of the electoral body with fundamental rights.
In a separate development, PTI leader and former minister Hammad Azhar withdrew his appeal against the rejection of nomination papers from NA-129 before the same bench.
Azhar's counsel informed the court that he did not wish to pursue the case. Justice Shah questioned the reference to Article 62 (i)-F in the high court's decision, stating that the verdict had clarified its applicability.
Hammad Azhar's counsel withdrew the appeal, and the former minister announced his decision to abstain from the upcoming general elections.
Meanwhile, PTI founder Imran Khan filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the rejection of nomination papers from NA-89 and NA-122. However, the registrar's office raised objections and returned the appeal.

5,Senate Committee discusses Amendment Bill 2024,"Constitution designated 10 reserved seats for non-Muslims in National Assembly, with entire country as constituency","The Senate’s Standing Committee on Law and Justice on Wednesday discussed the Constitution Amendment Bill 2024 (Amendment of Article 51).
The bill was introduced by senators Kauda Babar, Manzoor Ahmed Kakar, Naseebullah Bazai, Sana Jamali, and Danesh Kumar in the upper house on January 1.
Senator Danesh Kumar told the committee, which met with Senator Ali Zafar in the chair, that the Constitution designated 10 reserved seats for non-Muslims in the National Assembly, with the entire country as the constituency.
“This unrestricted geographical allocation allows political parties to nominate candidates freely, resulting in disproportionate representation favouring populous provinces,” he added.
The proposed amendment, he said, “seeks to rectify this by ensuring a minimum of one seat is allocated to each province, addressing the existing disparity”.
Following thorough discussions, the committee members unanimously supported the amendment, deeming it fair and equitable.
In response to legal concerns raised by Senator Kamran Murtaza on the matter, the chairman directed the Law Ministry and Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs to find out a way forward and also provide details of previous efforts to amend Article 51 of the Constitution.
Earlier, the members congratulated Senator Sania Nishtar for her appointment as the CEO of GAVI and Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayyed on his election as Vice President of IPU’s Human Rights Body.
The meeting was attended by senators Kamran Murtaza, Farooq Hamid Naek, Danesh Kumar and Walid Iqbal, and the Secretary of the Ministry of Law.

6,"Father to pay for child’s education, rules SC",Issues eight-page judgment regarding a case about maintenance of children,"The Supreme Court has held that a father is responsible for the maintenance of children, according to the Shariah and the country’s civil law and ruled that any expenditure on children’s education also falls under the category of maintenance.
Supreme Court Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi issued an eight-page judgment on Wednesday regarding a case about the maintenance of the children, stressing that access to basic and quality education was in the best interest of the child.
The appeal in the apex court stemmed from a divorce case. After the divorce, the woman had moved a family court for the maintenance of the former couple’s six-month old girl. In 2007, the family court had ordered the father of the girl to pay Rs1,000 per month for the maintenance of his daughter.
The woman again moved the family court for increase in the maintenance allowance and in 2021, the court increased the amount to Rs25,000. The father challenged the decision in the high court and then in the Supreme Court, taking the plea that he could not afford that much amount.
He said that his only source of income was his pension of Rs.60,000, while he also had family to support. On the other hand, the mother told the court that her daughter was studying in a university, and Rs25,000 per month was necessary to continue her education.
The judgment said that according to Islamic law, maintenance meant everything that was necessary for living. It added that the expenses on children’s education also came under the definition of  maintenance.
Therefore, the judgment said, the petitioner was obliged to pay the child support for her education until she completes her graduation and gets a job. It noted that it had been established by the trial court as well as other judicial forums that the petitioner had sources of income other than pension.

7,Pemra directed to ensure ‘unbiased’ coverage,"Imran challenges regulatory authority’s decision to bar satellite TV channels from airing his speeches ,media talks","The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday directed the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) to ensure that PTI founding member and former premier Imran Khan and candidates of all political parties are given “free and unrestricted” access to media ahead of the Feb 8 general polls.
Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza of the LHC passed the order on a petition filed by Imran.
In his plea, the former premier had challenged the regulatory authority’s decision to bar all satellite TV channels from airing his speeches and media talks.
In the written order, Justice Mirza noted that the Electronic Media (Programmes and Advertisements) Code of Conduct directed all media channels that any political programme should be conducted in an objective manner guaranteeing representation of all political parties.
“Clearly, the allegation agitated before this court by the petitioner is that the media channels breached the code of conduct when his [Imran’s] name was not even allowed to be taken in the programmes,” the order said.
“[…] Keeping in view the upcoming general elections, Pemra is directed to strictly ensure that the petitioner and candidates of all political parties are given free and unrestricted access to media platforms/channels without any constraints from any quarters,” it added.
