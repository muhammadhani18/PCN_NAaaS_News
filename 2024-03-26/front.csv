0,PM orders closure of non-tax-compliant factories,Establishes committee to probe reasons behind track and trace system's failure,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday directed to seal factories that are resisting the electronic monitoring of their production and sales lines, while seeking an action against the private contractors that could not effectively install the monitoring systems.
The premier has established a committee to investigate the reasons behind the track and trace system's failure, despite awarding an estimated Rs25 billion contract to a consortium consisting of M/s AJCL, MITAS, and Authentix, which largely remained non-functional.
The decision marks the seriousness of the government in ending tax evasion, which is going on in connivance with the tax machinery.
PM Shehbaz directed the formation of a committee to identify obstacles and those responsible for shortcomings in the track and trace system, as per a statement from the PM’s Office.
The committee's mandate includes submitting proposals for the implementation of an automatic tax system in factories and industries in the future.
The committee would identify the hurdles and people involved in tax theft within seven days, it added.
The PM instructed that the people from the FBR should not be involved in this fact-finding committee.
However, the task cannot be completed, as the FBR provides the secretariat support for the implementation of the track and trace system.
Shehbaz Sharif directed that all factories resisting the implementation of the track and trace system should be immediately sealed, as stated by the PM's office.
The prime minister was briefed that the track and trace system could not be fully operationalised in the sugar and cement sectors. The FBR also informed that the system was functioning in the tobacco and fertiliser sectors. However, counterfeit stamps have been discovered on cigarette packaging even within the tobacco sector.
The PM grilled the FBR for not taking the private contractor to task for its failure to effectively implement the electronic monitoring system.
The AJCL-led consortium had won the contract a few years ago on the back of the highest technical score, as its financial bid was 52% more expensive than the lowest bid. The price difference between the lowest financial bid of Rs499 per thousand stamps and the second highest bid offered by the consortium of AJCL Private Limited was Rs259 per thousand stamps.
This translated into an additional Rs8.5 billion payment to the bidder over the five-year contract period. The total estimated five-year contract value was Rs25 billion.
The five-year contract can be extended by another three years, taking the total additional financial impact to Rs13.5 billion. Installation of the track and trace system is one of the conditions that the IMF imposed on Pakistan under the last bailout package.
After awarding the license of the track and trace system last week, the FBR issued four sales tax general orders to monitor the production of tobacco, sugar, cement and fertiliser. But after SHC’s decision, the whole process will be stopped until the court vacates the stay order.
In 2021, former prime minister Imran Khan had inaugurated the Track and Trace system for electronic monitoring of manufacturing and sales of products of important sectors consisting of tobacco, fertilisers, sugar and cement.
PM Sharif asked for an end to fake and unregistered cigarettes and their destruction. The country was facing economic issues and the mafia with their connivance had been inflicting damages to the national kitty, he added.
The prime minister also asked for seeking help from international institutions in the track and trace system.
Sharif said all the legal impediments in the enforcement of the track and trace system should be removed. The prime minister directed that the system should be enforced at all the production lines of cement factories, he summoned a comprehensive plan for digital strategy and an automated track and trace system.
The meeting was apprised in detail about the hurdles in the automated enactment of the track and trace system in the cement, sugar, fertiliser and tobacco sectors. The meeting was told that in 14 tobacco factories, the system was fully functional whereas 12 others had been sealed for non-compliance.
The system was fully functional in the fertilizers industry while it was facing problems in sugar and cement factories due to some technical issues which were being addressed.
Had the private contractor effectively implemented the system, no sugar bag would have moved out of a production site, factory premises or manufacturing plant without affixation of activated stamps and Unique Identification Markings?
In 2022, the FBR had claimed that the digital monitoring system of sugar production had been implemented over 79 sugar mills, having 151 production lines nationwide. It went on to claim that there was a double-digit growth in revenue collection from the sugar sector, attributing the increase due to price hikes to a newly installed system.

1,"PM announces incentives for top exporters, taxpayers",Announces issuance of blue passports to 66 winners of tax and export excellence awards," 
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday announced special incentives for the country’s leading exporters and taxpayers.
He announced the issuance of blue passports to 66 winners of tax and export excellence awards, a privilege typically reserved for state and government functionaries. These 66 winners would also receive the ‘Pakistan Honour Card’ in recognition of their services.
Out of the pool of 66 recipients, 38 were exporters, and 28 were taxpayers who received the awards from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The prime minister also announced the topper of each individual category of exporters and taxpayers as Pakistan’s honorary ambassadors.
The leading exporters and the highest taxpayers are the heroes of the nation, said Sharif. The list of the top taxpayers in all categories and the companies categories also reveals the shallowness of Pakistan’s economy.
The public sector companies and the commercial banks remain the largest tax contributors.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb urged the business community to shun the import-led subsidies-driven business models and shift to export-led growth. The Minister said that the import-led business models were no longer sustainable.
The PM said that the chairman of the Muslim Commercial Bank (MCB) Mian Muhammad Mansha was the highest-income taxpayer with a Rs26 billion income tax contribution. The Style Textile was Pakistan’s single largest exporter that exported $522 million in goods in the last fiscal year, said the PM.
In the category of the ‘all the taxes’, state-owned Pakistan State Oil (PSO) was the highest taxpayer with Rs167 billion, followed by Pakistan Tobacco Company (PTC), Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL), Pak-Arab Refinery (PARCO), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and the Indus Motors.
The OGDCL in fact paid the highest income tax but since it was clubbed in all categories of taxpayers, the MCB became top-income taxpayers.
In the income tax category, Mian Mansha’s MCB was the highest taxpayer, followed by the United Bank Limited, Standard Chartered Bank, Habib Bank Limited and the National Bank of Pakistan.
In the category of individuals, Imtiaz Stores was the highest taxpayer with Rs683 million income tax contribution and Musadaq Zulqarnain of Interloop paid Rs458 million.
In the category of exporters, Style Textile was the leading exporter with $522 million in exports, followed by Interloop Prvt Limited and Nishat Mills. Former Finance Minister Miftah Ismail’s Ismail Industries was the highest exporter of the biscuit items. ICI Pakistan was the highest chemical exporter.
The Prime Minister said that the purpose of the ceremony was to recognize the heroes of the nation and those who honestly paid taxes and served the country through their talents, with the setting up of small and medium businesses, women entrepreneurs and those who had spurred the non-traditional exports.

The exporters would be happier getting regionally competitive energy rates instead of receiving these rewards, said Bashir Dewan, the President of the Pakistan Business Council.
Shehbaz Sharif lamented about the poor reputation of Pakistan, saying that when we go abroad even without a begging bowl in hand, foreign countries think we have the begging bowl under our arms.
The PM said that the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) was working to address the issues of red tapism, delays and inefficiency to attract investment.
The PM said that he has instructed to shut down junk government-owned power generation companies, outsource the international airports and privatise Pakistan International Airlines.
The government on Monday constituted the PIA board in an emergency. The board met on Tuesday and approved the segregation of the PIA for filing a scheme of arrangement with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, meeting one of the milestones for its privatisation.
It is expected that the SECP will approve the scheme of arrangement by Friday. The government plans to issue an expression of Interest on April 2 to invite bids for PIA privatisation. The tentative date for PIA bidding is June 11th.
The PM said that the FBR’s restructuring was in full swing and the government would appoint international consultants next month to digitise the tax machinery. He said that about Rs2.7 trillion in tax revenues were under litigation and he had requested the Chief Justice of Pakistan to timely decide these pending cases.
He underscored the need for the appointment of competent tribunal heads to expeditiously dispose of the pending litigation. He also appreciated the tax collectors and said that the good and competent tax collectors would also be given public recognition.
The prime minister also termed another IMF programme a requirement for the country’s economic stability. The premier once again said that he supports reducing the number of income tax slabs and increasing the narrow tax base.
He said that Pakistan enjoyed excellent ties with China and said that the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would expedite the economic development.
Chairman FBR Malik Amjad Zubair Tiwana highlighted different measures of FBR to increase tax net and revenue generation including facilities in payment and compliance of taxes by enhancing the use of technology.

2,Imran urges CJP to probe May 9 riots,Calls on CJP Isa to order retrieval of CCTV footage,"Amid electoral controversies and May 9 riots aftermath, PTI founding chairman Imran Khan has urged Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to consider the party’s petitions concerning the May 9 riots and the February 8 elections and form a judicial inquiry.
“Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa should order the retrieval of CCTV footage,” he demanded while speaking to journalists in Adiala Jail on Tuesday.He emphasized the imperative need for a judicial commission to thoroughly investigate the May 9 incidents and criticized the absence of any inquiry into the events.
Imran alleged that those responsible for tampering with CCTV footage must be held accountable.
Expressing dismay over the dissolution of a political party resulting from the crackdown following the May 9 events, he attributed it to what he termed the ‘London Plan’.”
“Just as Israel accuses Palestine of terrorism, we have been unjustly blamed for the May 9 incident,” he asserted.
Meanwhile, he hinted at addressing recent remarks made by US Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu regarding the cypher with the American ambassador, should they cross paths.
Imran stated that if he were to meet the US envoy, he would directly raise the issue with him. He added that had Lu acknowledged the conspiracy for regime change, it would have had significant repercussions within the Biden administration.
“If I encounter the American ambassador, I will certainly discuss Donald Lu’s statement and the alleged involvement of the American embassy in Pakistan,” the former prime minister stated.
He recalled that during a National Security Committee (NSC) meeting, former Pakistani envoy to the US, Asad Majeed, had acknowledged receiving a warning from the US. He also expressed bewilderment as to how the cypher in question got misplaced as there are certain security protocols within the Prime Minister's Office.
The statement from Imran comes days after Donald Lu dismissed allegations levelled against him by Imran, which had been central to the ‘cablegate’ cypher controversy, as a “conspiracy theory, lie, and complete falsehood”.
Lu, the diplomat whose purported warning to former Pakistan Ambassador to the US Asad Majeed was detailed in a cypher sent to Islamabad, formed the basis of accusations by PTI’s founder regarding a US conspiracy to topple his government in 2022. Imran Khan is currently facing trial for mishandling the confidential document in question.
Nonetheless, Imran’s party has termed Lu’s statement as a validation of the former prime minister’s narrative.
Talking to journalists, Imran also lambasted what he perceived as a biased judicial system, pointing out that the cases involving Nawaz Sharif, his daughter Maryam Nawaz, and Asif Ali Zardari have been closed.
“Nawaz Sharif acquired a Mercedes car from Toshakhana for Rs600,0000. Zardari obtained three vehicles from Toshakhana, which is legally impermissible. Corrupt individuals are being acquitted...”
He lamented that injustice has become rampant and might outweigh what is right.
Addressing rumours of a potential 'forward bloc' within PTI in Punjab, Imran expressed ignorance but mentioned he would gather information from the parliamentary leader of Punjab during their upcoming meeting.

'Threats to Imran's life'
Breaking her silence for the first time since the verdict in the Toshakhana reference, Bushra Bibi, the wife of PTI founding chairman Imran Khan, directed her criticism towards three individuals from the top military brass.
She issued a stern warning, stating that if any harm befell Imran Khan, they would be held responsible. Despite Imran Khan's attempts to intervene and restrain her, she addressed journalists at Adiala Jail.
Bushra Bibi disclosed that during the previous hearing, she consumed honey which she suspected was tampered with.
Throwing weight behind Bushra’s statements, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said that the onus of safeguarding Imran’s life lies with “powerful figures”.
He said that three specific individuals were named as there were genuine concerns about threats to the former prime minister’s safety.
Bushra Bibi's statement should be construed as reflective of the party's stance, he added.

3,Five Chinese killed in suicide blast,Dasu project staff targeted in Besham; 4 terrorists eliminated in DI Khan; attack on naval base in Turbat thwarted,"Pakistan has seen an upsurge in high-profile terrorist attacks since the new government took up the rein of power following the Feb 8 elections. Terrorists have carried out multiple brazen attacks in the northwest and southwest of the country, targeting the security forces and foreign interests in an attempt to destabilise the internal security situation and sow discord between Pakistan and its strategic allies, especially China.
Hours after security forces successfully fended off an attack by Baloch terrorists on a Pakistan Navy bases in Turbat district of Balochistan, a vehicle-borne suicide bomber targeted a convoy escorting Chinese engineers in the remote Besham area of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa on Tuesday, killing six people.
The Chinese engineers were en route from Islamabad to their camp in Dasu – the district headquarters of the Upper Kohistan district of K-P. Their vehicle was hit by an explosive-laden vehicle, coming from the opposite direction, near Lahore Nala on the Karakoram Highway.
According to a Chinese Embassy statement, a Chinese company’s bus, carrying staff, working on the Dasu Hydropower Project, was hit by terrorist attack at around 1pm. Malakand Deputy Inspector General Muhammad Ali Gandapur confirmed the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber.
The Chinese engineers’ vehicle was thrown off the mountainous road into a deep ravine by the impact of the blast, killing all six on board, including five Chinese engineers and their Pakistani driver. The security forces reached the spot, shut the strategic highway for traffic on both sides and launched investigation.
The area around Dasu – the construction site of the major hydropower project – has witnessed terrorist attacks in the past also. In 2021, 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals, were killed, and around two dozen others injured in a bus explosion.
The deadly suicide attack came hours after terrorists attempted to attack Pakistan’s naval base PNS Siddique in Turbat which was thwarted due to the swift and effective response by troops ensuring the safety and security of personnel and assets.
According to the military’s media wing, the ISPR, security forces in the vicinity were immediately mobilised to support the naval troops. “Synergetic & effective response by the armed forces enabled killing of all four terrorists in ensuing joint clearance operation,” it added. “However, during intense fire exchange, Sepoy Noman Fareed, aged 24 years and resident of Muzaffargarh, of Frontier Corps Balochistan, having fought gallantly, embraced shahadat.”
A sanitisation operation was launched in the area as the ISPR said, “Pakistan Armed Forces remain committed to eliminate the menace of terrorism from the country at all costs.”
The two high-profile attacks came on the heels of a brazen Baloch terrorist attack on Gwadar Port Authority complex, seven kilometres from the port itself and operated by China Overseas Ports Holding as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). As many as five security personnel were martyred in the attack in which all eight attackers were eliminated.
Meanwhile in other violence, security forces carried out an IBO in Dera Ismail Khan district and neutralised at least four terrorists who were involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and the killing of innocent civilians. Three of the dead terrorists have been identified as Mustafa, Qismatullah, and Islamuddin.

 
According to the military’s media wing, the recent incidents of terrorism, notably in Gwadar, Turbat, and Besham, were dastardly acts aimed at destabilising the internal security situation, adding that foreign elements were complicit in aiding and abetting terrorism in the country.
“While the first two attempts were successfully thwarted by the armed forces, the latest incident at Besham led to the loss of 6 innocent civilians including 5 Chinese nationals,” the ISPR said. “The whole nation stands in solidarity with our Chinese brothers and unequivocally condemns this cowardly act.”
With the unwavering support of the nation and iron-clad ally China, the ISPR said, “we will ensure that all those involved in aiding terrorism, directly or indirectly, are held accountable and find their due comeuppance”.

4,IHC raises questions about cipher text,The bench pointed out that the text of the document was not on record,"A divisional bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday expressed bewilderment as it noted that the cipher document was neither shown to the trial judge nor to the prosecution, yet it was stated that the enemy of the country benefited from its misuse.
The bench, comprising IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb, heard the appeal against conviction of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and senior leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the cipher case.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) told the bench that the cipher was received in coded form through email that would have been saved in the Foreign Office. However, Chief Justice Farooq remarked that the reply should be specific as the court could not rely on conjectures.
The bench pointed out that the text of the document was not on record and no one knew what the cipher text was yet it was stated that the enemy had benefited from its misuse. The bench asked whether Imran had any access to cipher code, the FIA prosecutor replied in the negative.
The bench asked the advocate general about the court’s order about the CVs of the state-appointed defence counsel. It admonished the advocate general to take court’s order seriously. Later, further hearing of the appeals was adjourned until Tuesday (today).
Separately, Additional District and Sessions Judge of Islamabad Tahir Abbas Sipra heard the bail applications of the PTI founder in six cases and of his wife, Bushra Bibi in one case.
The court directed that the appellants should be presented in the court through video link on April 4.
