0,JI censures police action on Gaza marchers,Says authorities resorted to ‘unconstitutional and undemocratic’ approach,"The Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) on Monday denounced the Islamabad police crackdown on protesters from their party and Gaza Bachao Tehreek – Save Gaza Movement – condemning it as an act of ‘barbarism’, and decrying it as both as ‘unconstitutional and undemocratic’. 
In a statement issued from Al-Markaz-e-Islami, Peshawar, K-P JI amir Prof Muhammad Ibrahim Khan and Secretary General Abdul Wasay lamented government’s “indifference” over the Israeli atrocities in Gaza, and noted that those who were raising their voice on the issue were being “suppressed”.
“They (authorities) are being more loyal than the king”.
A day earlier, protestors belonging to the JI and Save Gaza Movement — clashed with police as the former tried to enter Islamabad’s Red Zone to protest against the government’s inaction amid a brutal genocide of beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza.
Senator Mushtaq Ahmed led the protest demonstration on behalf of the JI. The Save Gaza Movement was represented by its central leader Humera Tayyaba. 
Upon the gathering of demonstrators, the police closed the gate leading to D-Chowk to prevent them from moving towards the Parliament House.
Mushtaq Ahmad held negotiations with the Federal Police SSP and requested permission to proceed towards the Red Zone.
However, the police officers refused to grant permission for the demonstrators to enter the Red Zone, which led to a confrontation between the protesters and the police.
According to the JI spokesperson, the police baton-charged peaceful protesters, resulting in injuries to some JI workers. As a result, the protesters also pelted stones at the police.
The protestors later staged a six-hour long sit-in near D-Chowk and broke their fast on the street. They announced staging a similar sit-in at the same place also next Sunday.
Condemning the incident, the JI on Monday termed the Islamabad police action as an act of ‘barbarism’.
“Storming the sit-on of Save Gaza Movement, disturbing the programme by removing the sound system and threatening Senator Mushtaq Ahmed is unconstitutional and undemocratic,” the JI statement said.

1,Balochistan to fire absent teachers,"Government plans dismissal of over 2,000 habitually absent educators","The Balochistan government has taken a decisive action by planning to terminate over 2,000 “habitually absent teachers” across the province. 
The decision was made during a high-level meeting convened by the education department, underscoring the government's commitment to improving educational standards across the province. 
The meeting was chaired by Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti. 
The huddle focused on various challenges confronting government educational institutions, ranging from low attendance rates among teachers to the lack of basic facilities in schools. 
As part of the comprehensive strategy to revitalise the education system, it was unanimously agreed to recruit contract teachers to bridge the staffing gap and ensure the functioning of inactive schools.
The meeting decided to terminate over 2,000 “habitually absent teachers” across Balochistan. 
Acknowledging the gravity of the situation, Chief Minister Bugti emphasised the need for accountability and transparency within the education sector. 
He underscored that the dismissal of habitually absent teachers would be swiftly executed within two months under the supervision of Balochistan chief secretary. Additionally, the implementation of a biometric attendance system in schools was mandated to monitor teacher presence effectively, with strict penalties for any system failures.
To further enhance oversight and accountability, the chief minister announced the inclusion of representatives from local bodies in district education groups. This measure aims to hold local education officers accountable and enforce strict adherence to duty among teaching staff, leaving no room for compromise.
In a resolute stance against undue political influence, the chief minister affirmed that appointments within the education department would be strictly based on merit, with no tolerance for external pressures. He reiterated his commitment to ensure practical performance from every level of the department, from secretaries to subordinate staff.
In a bid to personally assess the state of schools across remote areas of Balochistan, Chief Minister Bugti announced surprise visits to identify non-functional schools. Such schools, he emphasised, would not be spared scrutiny, especially those where vacancies exist despite salaries being drawn by teachers and staff. 
The chief minister vowed to reclaim school buildings currently under unauthorised occupation by vested interests, signaling a firm stance against misuse of public resources.
The decisions taken during the meeting mark a significant step forward in Balochistan's efforts to reform its education system. 
With a renewed focus on accountability, transparency, and meritocracy, the government aims to ensure that every child in the province gains access to quality education, paving the way for a brighter future for the province.
