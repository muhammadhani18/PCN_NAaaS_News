1,"Cases against journalists to be dropped, SC told",CJ asserts distinction between wrong law and its application," 
Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa emphasized during Monday's proceedings that while a flawed law and its misapplication were distinct issues, the court's authority did not extend to preventing the registration of any First Information Report (FIR).
Leading a three-member bench, presiding over a suo motu case addressing the harassment faced by journalists, the chief justice underscored that while an FIR might be flawed, each case would be examined individually by the court.
He noted that the court had initiated suo motu proceedings on the harassment of journalists back in 2021, lamenting that had the matter been resolved promptly, the current situation could have been avoided. He emphasized the severity of the issue, suggesting it surpassed mere Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) notices.
Barrister Salahuddin, representing the Press Association of the Supreme Court, contended that Section 20 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) had been consistently misapplied. He further asserted that while the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) possessed the power to effectuate arrests, this authority was being wielded to stifle journalists and media outlets.

Expressing concern, the chief justice questioned why individuals who had allegedly faced torture chose to retract their complaints.
He noted a pattern where accusations were made but parties failed to appear in court to present their perspectives. Additionally, he underscored the gravity of filing an FIR for harassment, deeming it a serious offense.
The chief justice inquired about the FIR against journalist Imran Shafqat and asked under which government it was filed. The attorney general replied that it was filed during the tenure of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government.
Chief Justice Isa asked whether there was any solid case against Imran Shafqat. The AGP replied that, in his view, there was nothing in this case, adding that Imran Shafqat did not commit any serious crime.
He also said that cases against journalists Amir Mir and Imran Shafqat would be withdrawn.
Lawyer Haider Waheed approached the bench with a request that he had filed an application related to media regulations. The chief justice asked whether he had a case of freedom of the press or any other agenda. He asked the lawyer to prove his good intentions first, and the court would hear him.
The court adjourned the hearing of the case until March 27.

2,Must have ‘genuine’ reason to suspend X: IHC CJ,Court summons authorised officer from interior ministry on April 3," 
Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq on Tuesday remarked that X was a social media platform for expressing opinions and there should be a genuine reason for suspending it under specific laws.
However, he added that the situation was different when it came to national security.
The IHC CJ was hearing a petition filed in the high court by a citizen through legal representatives, seeking its intervention to lift the ban on X and fully reinstate its services.
The petitioner argued that the continuous suspension of X since February 17 violated Article 19 of the Constitution.
The petition identified the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and the information ministry as respondents.
A written reply was submitted to the court by the PTA.
The lawyer representing the PTA produced a letter in a sealed envelope saying that it was only for the perusal of the court.

After reading the letter, the IHC CJ noted that there was nothing substantial in it.
He added that the letter should be shared with the petitioner’s lawyer as well.
The petitioner’s lawyer, Sardar Masroof, told the court that this letter was already available on social media platforms.
The PTA’s lawyer said they had suspended X because of this letter and they were bound to follow it.
He added that the reply had to be given by the interior ministry.
The IHC CJ noted that the petition represented many people who used X.
He continued that what is written on X might not be liked by certain people. Justice Farooq pointed out that a great deal was also written about the judiciary on the social media platform too.
“Things have changed in the last 20 or 30 years.”
The IHC summoned an authorised officer from the interior ministry on April 3.
Access to the social media giant has been blocked since February 17 as allegations of rigging during last month’s general elections continue to make news.
UK-based Alp Toker, the director of NetBlocks, said the X disruption in Pakistan could have millions of dollars in economic impact in the region.
""The disruption to X in Pakistan could have an economic impact in the region of $50 million, based on our COST outage disruption impact estimator. This takes into account lost productivity and lost business and investment opportunities,"" Toker said in a statement sent to Anadolu Agency.

5,PTI infighting escalates over Marwat's statements,Core committee berates leader for 'attacking his own people'," 
Tensions brewed within the ranks of the PTI as members expressed dismay over what they alleged were damaging remarks made by fellow party colleague Sher Afzal Marwat.
The matter came to a head during a heated exchange at the party's core committee meeting on Monday.
Sources privy to the meeting revealed a sharp exchange of words between PTI members Sher Afzal Marwat and Niazullah Niazi. Marwat found himself at the receiving end of criticism from several core committee members, with Firdous Shamim Naqvi going as far as suggesting that Marwat seemed to need constant supervision with a ""teacher"" to guide him at all times and curb his outspoken tendencies.
""He is attacking his own people,"" Naqvi expressed concerns.
Marwat, on the other hand, lamented what he alleged was a smear campaign against him, accusing party members of remaining silent in the face of adversity. ""I have led PTI, and PTI's own members are talking against me,"" Marwat voiced his frustrations.
However, core committee members denounced Marwat's deviation from the party's established narrative. They asserted that it took considerable effort to shape the party's message over months, only for Marwat to undermine it swiftly.
Amid the escalating verbal confrontation, party leaders such as Ali Mohammad Khan, Naeem Panjutha, and Barrister Gohar intervened to defuse tensions.
The escalating tensions unfolded against the backdrop of a series of contentious statements given by Marwat which provided fodder for speculations, especially from rivals, that there was a lack of consensus in the party.
Recently, controversy involving Marwat and Ali Muhammad Khan erupted, who pointed fingers at their own party's social media team for allegedly launching a smear campaign against former cricket captain Shahid Afridi.
The controversy erupted when an old video of Afridi circulated on social media platforms, wherein he addressed the no-confidence motion against then-prime minister Imran Khan, his pre-election pledges, and the performance of his government.
Marwat, in response, blamed PTI's social media team for propagating negative narratives against Afridi, urging them to highlight his positive attributes instead. PTI's social media activist Azhar Mashwani swiftly reacted to Marwat's statements, urging him to retract his remarks.‘Cracks within PTI’Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar there was a sheer power struggle within the ranks of PTI that may lead to its disintegration or creation of a forward block.
Addressing a news conference, he said that top PTI leaders like Gohar Khan and Sher Afzal Khan were taking contradictory stances on different issues. He regretted the ""childish attitude"" put up by the PTI which was a national party.
Tarar advised the PTI leaders to shun its internal politics and play its due role in strengthening the economy.
Lambasting the PTI, he said sometimes they wrote a letter to the IMF but sometimes asked the European Union to investigate the election process in Pakistan. If they had any complaint, they should knock on the door of the Election Commission of Pakistan or Election Tribunals, he said.
He said once they were accusing the US of toppling the PTI government, now they had hired lobbying firms in the United States. The minister said that American diplomat Donald Lu had called the PTI founder a ""certified liar"".
He urged the PTI leaders to join mainstream politics and contribute to the nation-building process. ""We need to create unity and consensus at the national political scenario,"" he said.

6,Swati's nomination papers reinstated,Appellate tribunal defers verdict on Swati's appeal regarding nomination for technocrat seat," 
The appellate tribunal on Monday reversed the decision to reject the nomination papers of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Azam Swati for the upcoming Senate election, slated for April 2.
Convened by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to address electoral grievances, the appellate tribunal took up Swati's petition contesting the rejection of his nomination papers for the Senate's general and technocrat seats.
However, the tribunal has deferred its verdict on Swati's appeal regarding his nomination for the technocrat seat.
Presided over by Justice Shakeel Ahmad, the tribunal's hearing saw presentations from legal representatives of both parties. The judge probed the grounds on which the nominations were dismissed.
Swati's legal counsel informed Justice Ahmad that objections against his client's nomination were lodged by three individuals, two of whom were not contenders in the upcoming election.
The counsel elaborated on the nature of objections raised against Swati, highlighting discrepancies in the presentation of cases compared to previous general elections.
Furthermore, the counsel argued that Swati's extensive experience as a senator, spanning 18 years and including two terms on the technocrat seat and one term on the general seat, contradicted claims of his ineligibility based on purported lack of experience.
Responding to objections, the complainant's counsel contended that a senatorial candidate for the technocrat seat must possess a 16-year education and 20 years of experience, criteria purportedly unmet by Swati.
Justice Ahmad noted Swati's past service as a senator and his involvement in legislative activities within the upper house of parliament. However, concerns were raised regarding Swati's alleged omission of legal cases from his nomination papers, with implications of deliberate misrepresentation.
The tribunal, after hearing arguments from both sides, opted to reserve its verdict for further consideration.
The ECP's tribunal has given a nod to the nomination papers of the outspoken PTI leader for the general seat. The tribunal will address his appeal regarding the rejection of his nomination for the technocrat seat in the forthcoming hearing.
In addition, the tribunal has ruled another PTI leader, Murad Saeed, as eligible to contest the upcoming Senate election. Saeed's appeal against the rejection of his nomination papers by the election commission was accepted by the tribunal.
The decision comes after the top electoral body recently rejected the nomination papers of senior leaders of the Imran-founded party, who were nominated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on both general and technocrat seats.

8,Steps take to provide relief: Jam,Said the government had to boost industry and manage the energy crisis,"Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan stressed on Monday the need for a price control mechanism in the country, saying that the relief provided to the masses through sales at the Utility Stores at reasonable rates was not a solution to the problem of inflation.

“All the items at the Utility Store are available at reasonable prices. The Utility Stores are not meant to beat the inflation, but a step to provide relief,” the minister said. “The government is taking initiatives for the provision of relief to the public,” he added.
About the economy, he said that the onus was on the government to put its house in order. He added that the government had to boost industry and manage the energy crisis. “When we borrow from IMF [International Monetary Fund] we had to return it too in a good manner,” he said.
