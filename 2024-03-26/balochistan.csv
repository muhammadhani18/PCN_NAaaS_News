0,Old Lahore lapses into rack and ruin,"Cleaning and disposal of garbage across the city, including Old Lahore, was the responsibility of the LWMC, WCLA","Outlanders looking at Old Lahore from the bird’s eye view of a skilled documentarian’s camera lens would undoubtedly be left enchanted by the timeless majesty exuded by the royal forts, magnificent minarets and towering gates, which are the nostalgic remnants of a cultural past, where mighty elephants and magnanimous kings tramped over the same lush green flatland however, a zoomed in look at the same picture perfect scenery would reveal a rather repulsive sight, one where piles of rancid garbage are seen comfortably embracing the centuries-old marvels of history. 
The Walled City of Lahore, also known colloquially as the Old Lahore, lies under the jurisdiction of two supervisory bodies, the Walled City of Lahore Authority (WCLA) and the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC).
Despite, billions of rupees being spent annually on their functioning, a lack of communication among the two authorities on the management and collection of waste in the gated area, has allowed the historical heritage of the inner city to be encompassed by piles of garbage, which not only tarnishes the touristic appeal of the area but also irks the residing locals, who are literally living in a pile of rubbish.
“We have been living in Old Lahore since several generations however, till date no effective cleaning mechanism is in place for disposing off the garbage, due to which piles of trash are sitting at every nook and corner. Just before the elections, candidates undertake construction and repair work here, but once the polls are over, the sanitation work is abandoned,” said Imran Hira, a resident of the inner city, who further revealed that neither the LWMC nor the WCLA were willing to take responsibility for the area’s cleanliness.
“The only time, the authorities take cleaning seriously is when some tourists are visiting,” he added.
Similarly, Faraz Chaudhary, another resident of the inner city, shared that his father and grandfather were also locals of the same area near Delhi Gate. “In spite of us paying the sewerage tax to the government through our water utility bills, the state of cleanliness in areas surrounding the Delhi Gate, is abysmal,” revealed Chaudhary, who had filed complaints to both the WCLA and LWMC on several occasions but no attention was paid.
“Whenever the WCLA is informed about the problem through a letter, it is disregarded by the higher officials of the authority and no solution comes from it,” confirmed a top bureaucrat, on the condition of anonymity.
In his defense, WCLA’s spokesperson, Muhammad Owais, claimed that the cleaning and disposal of garbage across the city, including Old Lahore, was the responsibility of the LWMC.
“Due to the lack of proper cleaning arrangements in certain areas of the inner city, we have recruited some employees for cleaning the area. We have shared a list of 29 historical places in the inner city, with the LWMC, so that better cleaning arrangements can be made before the arrival of tourists, but the places are still untidy. This is creating a negative perception among foreign tourists that perhaps Pakistan does not preserve its culture and heritage,” asserted Owais.
On the other hand, Umar Chaudhary, spokesperson of the LWMC, claimed that the management of waste in the inner city is the responsibility of the WCLA, for which they have also recruited employees.
“We have repeatedly requested the WCLA to inform us about the arrival of tourists so that we may clean the areas, but the concerned officers do not cooperate,” differed Chaudhary.

1,Aitchison College principal quits over interference,Governor House sources defend role in fee waiver,"Aitchison College Principal Michael A Thomson has resigned, blaming pressure on the administration from the Punjab governor's office among the reasons.
In his resignation letter sent to the governor's secretariat and college administration, that amidst extreme bad governance, he was left with no other choice but to leave the institution.
Sources in the college said the governor had used his powers to waive the fees and fine of former bureaucrat and Federal Minister Ahad Cheema's sons despite the college administration’s unwillingness.
On the other hand, sources in the Governor House said the office had already accepted the resignation and a search committee had been set up for the appointment of a new principal.
In his letter, Michael A Thomson stressed the dignity and integrity of the education institution, while condemning political interference in its matters.
""This is not how I planned to leave Aitchison, but I will share with you that a continuation of very poor governance has left me no other choice. Throughout my time as principal, I have done my very best to protect the school’s reputation while extending compassion to those in need. However, there is a crucial difference in this pursuit and blatant policy manufacturing to accommodate certain individuals because such people simply insist on preferential treatment. Politics and nepotism have no space in schools,” he wrote.
He claimed that over the past year, prejudiced actions by the Governor House had contributed to a breakdown of governance and management, under which he had to finally draw a line. “It seems incredulous to me, and quite possibly to most other people, that a school so successful can be subjected to such unwarranted interference and brazen directives,” he added.
He stated that a foreigner did not venture to another country with less than pure intent and nor should that person act in any way to encourage or facilitate what he considered to be wrong.
“I leave on April 1 and will not play any role in the management of upcoming admissions,” wrote Michael A Thomson in his letter.
Meanwhile, sources in the Governor House insisted that fee concession had been given to former bureaucrat Cheema's sons on merit as they were not studying in the college during the period. The family had shifted to Islamabad so the fee relaxation had been given, which would also be given to other students, they said.
The sources said the principal had resigned last year and he had been requested to continue to serve till August this year.
They said the search committee had initiated the process for the appointment of a new principal. A new principal was likely to be appointed in the coming month, the sources added.

2,CM terms kite flying ‘blood sport’,"Maryam, PML-N Quaid visit victim’s house","Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Quaid Muhammad Nawaz Sharif visited on Monday the house of Asif Ashfaq, a young man who was killed by metallic kite string.
Both the chief minister and the former prime minister offered their condolences to Asif Ashfaq's father Muhammad Ashfaq and other family members.
They expressed their deep grief, sorrow and sympathies with the bereaved family.
“I am a mother and understand the pain of a mother,” the CM remarked while consoling the victim’s mother.
“The painful death of Asif Ashfaq is a matter of concern for the entire society.”
Nawaz Sharif also consoled the bereaved family and said: “Everyone should play their role to stop this crime.”
“Kite flying has become a blood sport, not a pastime anymore,” the CM said.
She requested the parents to fulfill their social responsibility by preventing their children from flying kites. “Strict legal action will be taken on making, selling and buying of metallic kite string.”
The IGP briefed the chief minister about the arrests of suspects responsible for the tragic incident.
Meanwhile, a motorcyclist was injured when a kite string got entangled around his neck on Qasim Road.
Chief Police Officer (CPO) Muhammad Ali Zia has taken note of the incident and requested a report from the SP for further investigation. Rescue sources said 22-year-old Ijaz Ahmed, a resident of Qasim Bazaar, was riding a motorcycle on Qasim Road en route to Degree College for some errands when a kite string got entangled around his neck, causing injury.
After receiving medical assistance, he was transferred to Samundri Tehsil Hospital, where doctors provided him with medical care. Retired, the CPO, has taken note of the incident and requested a report from the Division SP for further investigation.
Following the death of a young man due to a chemical string incident, the police have intensified their efforts to protect motorcyclists from similar incidents.
Over 22,000 motorcyclists have been equipped with safety antennas during the safety wire campaign. Additionally, awareness walks and seminars against kite flying were organised, leading the Chief Police Officer (CPO) to issue orders for collecting surety bonds from transporters and owners of high-rise buildings in the city.
In response to the CPO's directives, the Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) instructed officers to install 10 safety wire antennas on each motorcycle and capture photos, number plates and contact numbers of citizens for documentation.
Meanwhile, law enforcement authorities have arrested 235 individuals involved in manufacturing and selling kite flying equipment during the last 24 hours.
Cases have been registered against them, and substantial quantities of kites and raw materials have been seized. However, there have been reports of innocent and disabled individuals being mistakenly apprehended and penalized.
The crackdown on kite flying operations intensified after the tragic death of Asif Ashfaq, who was fatally injured by a string while riding his motorcycle on Dijkot road.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz took notice of the incident, prompting police action against all aspects of kite flying, including manufacturing, sale, and flying.
In various divisions of the city, including Lyllpur Town, Madina Town, Iqbal Town, Jaranwala, and Saddar, numerous individuals have been arrested during police operations.
During a raid in Montgomery Bazaar, a disabled resident named Muhammad Jameel was apprehended, with the police claiming to have seized kite-flying paraphernalia from him. However, CCTV footage contradicts this, showing him innocently preparing tea before his arrest.
Despite the ongoing efforts, there have been criticisms of police inefficiency, with reports of innocent individuals being targeted and cases filed against them. Nevertheless, raids on kite-making factories have resulted in the seizure of machinery and significant quantities of kite-related materials.
In addition to enforcement actions, the police have initiated an awareness campaign to educate the public about the dangers of kite flying and the importance of safety measures.

3,Protests erupt over BISP ‘mismanagement’,"Woman monitoring officer, tasked with investigating complaints, attacked by retailers","Women took to the streets to protest against a reduction in assistance provided under the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
The outcry followed complaints from beneficiaries who alleged receiving significantly less aid than expected from registered retailers.
The situation escalated when a monitoring officer, tasked with investigating the complaints, faced a violent altercation at Muzaffar and Sajid Retailers shop in Ada Sawaiwala.
Upon questioning the retailers about the deductions, the officer, identified as Shazia, was met with hostility and physical assault. Shockingly, the officer was slapped and forcibly ejected from the premises.
Despite filing a formal complaint, authorities have yet to apprehend the accused retailers, identified as Muzaffar and Sajid.
Instead, minor charges have been levied against them, raising concerns about ‘the efficacy of existing laws in protecting women from workplace harassment.
Moreover, reports suggest that the influence of the accused has allowed illegal deductions to persist unabated at the retailer's shop.
This flagrant disregard for the law has sparked widespread condemnation and prompted calls for swift and decisive action.
In response to mounting pressure, the Punjab government has initiated a campaign, titled ""Never Again,"" aimed at curbing harassment and ensuring the safety of women across the province. However, these efforts appear to ring hollow as instances of harassment continue to surface, underscoring the need for greater accountability and enforcement.
Adding fuel to the fire, patrolling police officer Ghazi Younis stands accused of further victimising the monitoring officer by pressuring her to reconcile with the assailants. This reprehensible behaviour has reignited calls for systemic reforms and a crackdown on corruption within law enforcement agencies.
In a written complaint to the Inspector General of Punjab Police, the victim detailed the harrowing ordeal, alleging coercion and intimidation by the patrolling police officer. Such abuses of power undermine public trust in law enforcement and highlight the urgent need for reform.
Amidst growing public outcry, citizens have come forward to expose collusion between patrolling police and local retailers, accusing them of exploiting beneficiaries for personal gain. These revelations have cast a shadow of doubt over the integrity of law enforcement and underscore the urgent need for accountability measures.
Efforts to seek clarification from DSP Patrolling Police Bahawalnagar, Irfan Akbar, have been met with evasion, further eroding public confidence in the authorities.
As demands for justice grow louder, social and civic circles are calling on higher authorities to take decisive action against the perpetrators and restore faith in the justice system.
Talking to The Express Tribune, SP PHP Muzammil stated that Constable Younas stopped Shazia and her husband for routine EPP checking. They were allowed to proceed, and he claimed no prior acquaintance with Shazia.
According to him, there was no threat made. However, a thorough investigation is necessary after hearing from both sides.

4,"Walkout, pandemonium mar budget debate",Opposition accuses PML-N leader of threatening PTI founder,"The budget debate in the Punjab Assembly was marred by a walkout from the treasury benches for the second time in a week on Monday.
Information Minister Azma Bukhari alleged that a legislator from the opposition had made an explicit gesture towards the treasury benches.
On the direction of Deputy Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar, opposition and treasury members persuaded their colleagues who had walked out to return to the house.
On the third day of the general discussion on the annual budget 2023-24, opposition highlighted weaknesses in the document, while the legislators from the treasury benches applauded it along with appeals for more focus on various sectors.
Pandemonium erupted in the house when Deputy Opposition Leader Moeen Riaz Qureshi sought to raise a point of order expressing concern over a statement of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Rana Sana Ullah regarding the life of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) founding chairman Imran Khan.
Qureshi said former prime minister Khan had already faced an attack soon after similar threats in the past, and now again such statements were surfacing. 
He termed Rana Sana’s statement a threat to Imran Khan’s life. 
He also said that the Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) women, including senior leaders, were still facing false and forged cases, which was regrettable.
Information Minister Azma Zahid Bukhari objected to continuous intervention of the opposition lawmakers during the speeches of the treasury legislators.
As the opposition lawmakers created pandemonium in the house, the minister started shouting at them, alleging that one of them had made an objectionable gesture. 
She left the house in protest against the opposition’s conduct along with other women members, saying she could not compromise on the dignity of the women.
Opposition lawmakers said the government should answer queries rather than escaping.
During the budget debate, senior lawmaker Rana Aftab criticised the government over its non-seriousness measures and inadequate allocation for education. He asked the treasury members if the children of anyone of them studied in a government school.
He said the health, agriculture, law and order and other sectors also required serious attention.
PML-N’s Amjad Ali Javed and Rahila Khadim, PPP’s Shazia Abid and several other members shared proposals to make more viable the education and health sectors.
Rahila Khadim said the new lawmakers should consider it an opportunity to learn.
