0,"Iraq, oil firms trade blame over pipeline",Iraq owes Turkey payments as long as the pipeline is technically operational,"Foreign oil firms operating in Iraq’s Kurdistan region are partly to blame for the delay in resuming crude exports after failing to submit contracts for revision, Iraq’s oil ministry said.
The Iraq-Turkey oil pipeline (ITP) which once handled about 0.5% of global oil supply has been halted, stuck in legal and financial limbo, since March 2023.
The flows were halted after the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce in a longstanding arbitration case ruled Ankara had violated provisions of a 1973 treaty by facilitating such exports without the consent of the Iraqi federal government.
Iraq’s oil ministry in a statement noted that foreign companies, alongside the Iraqi Kurdish authorities, have still not submitted contracts for revision to the ministry. The government is seeking to revise such deals after a court ruled ones signed with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) were invalid, it said in response to a statement on Saturday by the Association of the Petroleum Industry of Kurdistan. Iraq’s federal court in 2022 deemed an oil and gas law regulating the Kurdistan region’s oil and gas industry as unconstitutional.
Iraq owes Turkey payments as long as the pipeline is technically operational - estimated by consultancy Wood Mackenzie at around $25 million per month.

1,OCAC backs old price mechanism,Urges OGRA to revert to old methodology that considered prevailing dollar rate,"The oil industry has called for reverting to the old methodology of price revision based on the current value of dollar indexation.
In a letter written to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) chairman, the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC), a lobbying group of oil industry players, called for re-establishing the old mechanism where the current dollar rate was taken into consideration.
“We are writing regarding the exchange rate computation methodology used for calculating fortnightly prices of petroleum products. Our request is to revert to the previous methodology, thereby returning to a simpler and clearer process,” the OCAC stressed.
In the past, it added, the exchange rate applicable at the time of pricing was used for the computation of petroleum rates.
“However, effective from August 1, 2022, Ogra changed its methodology. Instead of using the latest available exchange rate, Ogra shifted to a 15-day average exchange rate, despite reservations from the oil industry. This change created exchange rate exposure for the oil industry,” the lobbying group said.
“We understand that using the latest available exchange rate at the date of price change reflects the exchange rate for the upcoming fortnight and would be a better option compared to the current practice of using a 15-day average exchange rate.
“Since the Pakistani rupee has currently stabilised, the impact of correcting the pricing mechanism will be negligible. Therefore, we propose reverting to the system of using the exchange rate applicable at the time/ date of pricing change.”
OCAC sought support for implementation of the recommendation and expressed its willingness to present the proposal in person.
In the past, then finance minister Ishaq Dar used different tactics to keep petroleum prices at lower levels. It was his idea that oil price calculation should be based on the average exchange rate rather than the exchange rate at the time of price revision. At that time too, the OCAC raised the issue but the then Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government turned down the request.
Now, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led government is again in power, prompting the OCAC to take up the matter with Ogra for its resolution.
Increase in margins
Separately, the petroleum dealers association has approached Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, asking him to increase margins on oil sales.
“This is to bring to your attention that last time the petroleum dealer’s margins were increased in September 2023. Since then, we have experienced a significant rise in various operational costs, including electricity charges, interest rates, labour costs, franchise fee of oil marketing companies and Kibor (Karachi Inter-bank Offered Rate),” the association chairman said in a letter.
“Despite our best efforts to adhere to all statutory requirements and operate compliantly, the existing margins have rendered our earnings unsustainable.”
Additionally, the rampant influx of smuggled petroleum products has dealt a severe blow to both the country’s economy and the registered petroleum dealers.
“While we diligently uphold our commitments and investments, the prevalence of smuggled products at lower prices has led to a drastic decline in petrol pump sales up to 50%,” he said, adding that this detrimental trend not only undermined the petroleum industry but also posed a grave threat to the overall economy.
Given the complexity
of the situation, the association appealed for a prompt resolution of the dealers’ grievances to enable them to sustainably operate the industry.
It cautioned the government that failure to address such pressing issues may leave them with no choice but to cease operations, which would have adverse implications for their businesses as well as the broader economy.

2,Rupee appreciates slightly to 278.12/$,Maintains winning streak for 8th straight day on better dollar inflows,"Pakistani currency notched up fresh gains for the eighth consecutive working day on Monday, rising to a new five-month high at Rs278.12 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market in the wake of higher supply of the foreign currency compared to its demand.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the rupee inched up Rs0.02 on a day-on-day basis against the greenback.
The currency has cumulatively gained 10.41%, or Rs28.95, in the past six and a half months compared to the all-time low close of Rs307.10/$ recorded in the first week of September 2023.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported that the local currency closed unchanged at Rs280.73/$ in the open market for the second successive working day.
Read Rupee surges to new five-month high at Rs278.14/$
Market talk suggests that achievement of a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the release of third and last loan tranche of $1.1 billion has encouraged other global financial institutions including the World Bank to unlock financing for different projects in Pakistan.
The inflows will help the country keep foreign exchange reserves at stable levels despite continuous repayment of the maturing foreign debt.
More importantly, the reserves have continued to improve over the past two consecutive weeks, reaching a five-week high at $8.02 billion in the week ended March 15, 2024.
The sale of dollar proceeds by exporters and the inflow of remittances during the holy month of Ramazan and ahead of Eid festival helped push the reserves above $8 billion.

3,Stocks rebound on World Bank loan approval,"KSE-100 index gains 373.82 points, settles at 65,525.65","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday experienced a significant recovery, driven by the World Bank’s approval of $150 million project financing and completion of final review under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $3 billion standby arrangement (SBA).
In the morning, the market saw a lacklustre start with the KSE-100 index touching the intra-day low of 65,301.73 points. However, investor sentiment turned positive as data revealed a current account surplus of $128 million in February alongside surging global crude prices and the rebound in Pakistani rupee following IMF’s initial approval of a $1.1 billion tranche.
The oil and gas exploration sector led the market’s gains on reports of government efforts to draw investment from friendly countries in Pakistan’s largest hydrocarbon explorer. Banking, fertiliser and power sectors also helped push the index upwards.
Eventually, the bourse reached the intra-day high of 65,656.49 points but closed more than 100 points below the peak.
“Stocks showed a strong recovery as investors weighed the World Bank’s approval of $149.7 million project financing and Pakistan-IMF staff-level agreement in the final review,” said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.
“Upbeat data showing a $128 million current account surplus in February, higher global crude oil prices and rupee recovery after the IMF’s initial approval of a $1.1 billion tranche played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.”

4,Competitors raise concern over telecom merger,CCP says reservations about PTCL-Telenor merger can delay due diligence,"As one of the largest mergers in Pakistan’s telecom sector is underway, the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has said that the decision on acquisition of Telenor Pakistan by Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) could be delayed as competitors have expressed concern over the plan.
In a statement, the CCP said that a pre-merger application about PTCL’s intention to acquire 100% shareholding of Telenor Pakistan and Orion Towers was received on February 29, 2024.
However, the application was submitted with an incorrect fee and the remaining fee was sent to the commission on March 6, 2024. Later, to complete due diligence, further information was sought but PTCL’s legal teams had yet to submit the required information.
CCP pointed out that “after all the relevant documents and information is received, the commission has 30 working days to complete its due diligence, for the first phase review”.
Meanwhile, the CCP received concerns from a competitor about the intended acquisition of Telenor by PTCL, claiming that the move would reduce the number of competitors offering telephony services and it would further delay the due diligence process.

At present, four players are working in the telecom industry, led by Jazz and include Telenor, Zong and Ufone. Ufone is a subsidiary of PTCL and after the acquisition of Telenor, both Ufone and Telenor will be merged to become as large as Jazz.
Currently, the CCP’s merger department is processing 21 applications, which also include the acquisition of Telenor.
Other major merger in the telecom sector occurred in 2016 when Jazz acquired Warid. At that time, the CCP conducted a phase-II review, which included shareholdings in parent companies of Jazz.
Incidentally, during the phase-II review, CCP teams discovered that Telenor International had shareholding in Veon Limited, the parent company of Jazz.
Veon, a Dutch-domiciled multinational telecommunication services company, was directed by the CCP that shareholders of Telenor International would not attend Jazz-related agenda items in Veon board meetings, to ensure that there was no collusive decision-making between Telenor and Jazz’s parent company that could impact competition in Pakistan’s telecom sector.

5,Govt urged to protect auto industry,PAMA’s Khan says import of used vehicles has increased by staggering 641% this year,"Secretary General of the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA), Abdul Waheed Khan has urged the government to support the local auto industry amid rising concerns over a significant increase in used car imports, which are negatively impacting the struggling automobile sector.
According to import data, the influx of used vehicles has soared to 25,098 units, marking a staggering 641% increase during the first eight months of the current fiscal year compared to around 3,386 units imported in the same period last year. The majority of these imported vehicles fall into categories such as SUVs, eco-pickups, minivans, and others. In February 2024 alone, 3,213 used vehicles were imported, compared to 396 units during the same period last year.
“The expiration of SROs 1571/22 and 1572/22 has resulted in the Regulatory Duty (RD) and Additional Customs Duty (ACD) previously imposed on used vehicles being lifted, placing locally-produced vehicles at a competitive disadvantage. Despite this, there has been no revision to the higher taxation imposed,” stated Khan in a statement on Monday. “Furthermore, SRO 577/2005, which prescribes duties and taxes on used vehicles, has not been amended in about ten years, resulting in lower duty calculations. This situation worsens when a 60% depreciation of duties and taxes is applied.”
Khan urged the government to implement measures to curb the illegal import of used cars, thereby supporting the local auto industry, which is currently facing multiple challenges. He stressed the importance of the local automobile industry in attracting foreign investment, promoting technology transfer, creating jobs, contributing significantly to tax revenue, and playing a crucial role in large-scale manufacturing, thereby contributing to the economic growth of the country.
Read Auto industry forced to slash prices
To sustain the growth of the local industry and achieve the objectives of the Automotive Industry Development and Export Plan (AIDEP) 2021-2026, Khan stressed the need for policy sustainability. The AIDEP aims to promote small cars, increase localisation, incentivise the introduction of new products in tractors and motorcycles, ensure consumer protection, promote new technologies such as Electric Vehicles (EVs) and hybrids, and target export markets.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Murtaza Mandviwala, a leading auto expert, dealer, and author of ‘Steering The Pakistani Wheel’, said, “Until localisation is promoted in the country, auto prices will remain high. Enhancing road transportation is key to improving mobility, and increasing localisation is essential. It presents a straightforward approach for the government to levy taxes on autos, aimed at boosting revenue.”
Mandviwala suggested reducing import duties on auto parts, opening trade with India to access cheaper components, and stopping the misuse of used car imports to address the growing volume in Pakistan.

7,SLG first logistics company to list on PSX,Slated to offer 50 million shares at minimum (floor price) of Rs12 per share to raise Rs600 million,"The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) is gearing up to host its inaugural company of 2024 on its trading platform this week. Secure Logistics Group (SLG), the pioneering logistics entity to be listed at the national bourse, is slated to offer 50 million shares at a minimum (floor price) of Rs12 per share. The objective is to raise a minimum of Rs600 million through the book-building process, following the stabilisation of the volatile political and economic landscape post-February general elections and the recent achievement of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff-level agreement.
The company’s prospectus, available on the PSX website, articulates its primary goals for raising equity capital: to deleverage the balance sheet in a challenging high-interest rate environment, advance the company’s technological infrastructure to complete the Tech-Pivot initiative, expand into regional markets, and enhance fleet-related efficiencies.
According to existing laws, the share price can increase by a maximum of 40% to Rs16.80 per share from the floor during the two-day bidding, potentially attracting up to Rs840 million.
This Initial Public Offering (IPO) marks the first public offering in the past seven months, with the last one occurring in August 2023.
“SLG aims to establish itself as a ‘Regional Player’ by forging connections with Central Asian markets, leveraging the strategic advantages offered by the proximity of sea ports in Pakistan,” as stated in the prospectus.
The company intends to develop an integrated technology platform to optimise the efficiency of its ‘in-house’ operational assets. This platform will facilitate real-time reservation of transportation assets, allocation of warehousing space, tracking of cargoes, and invoicing.
Furthermore, the company plans to augment its current fleet by adding a minimum of five distribution vehicles (110/120 HP), partially funded through the equity raised at PSX.

Arif Habib Limited (AHL) serves as the exclusive financial adviser and book-runner for the IPO.
The company plans to offer 100% (50 million shares) to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals during the book-building process. This phase will determine a strike price, with 75% of the 50 million shares allocated to major investors. The remaining 25% will be offered to retail investors at the strike price subsequently.
The Express Tribune learnt that SLG is an integrated logistics company with three distinct yet complementary business lines: logistics, asset tracking, and security services. With a nationwide presence, the company serves nearly 125 corporate clients across all three sectors.
Additionally, it has been reported that the company secured Pre-IPO equity of Rs585 million from strategic investors Saudi Bugshan and Karandaaz Pakistan.
The company reported an earnings per share of Rs2.28 for the calendar year 2023, resulting in a price-to-earnings ratio of 5.39 at a floor price of Rs12 per share.
SLG, headquartered in Islamabad, specialises in providing logistics and vehicle fleet management services in Pakistan. Following the IPO, SLG is poised to become the first logistics-listed company in the country, according to sources.
Currently managing a fleet of 283 vehicles, SLG anticipates its revenue to reach Rs2.1 billion in 2023, with an expected 28% growth in 2024, as stated by the AHL CEO.
SLG had initially planned the IPO for 2022, aiming to raise Rs1.5 billion. However, this plan was put on hold temporarily due to political and economic uncertainties, which could have affected the accurate pricing of stocks through a Dutch auction.
The last IPO at PSX occurred approximately five months ago when Symmetry Group went public in early August 2023. It was the sole IPO of the preceding year, characterised by heightened political and economic crises.

8,Banks to get preferential treatment,Govt mulls settling high interest on $88m PIA loan without restructuring,"The federal government is set to provide preferential treatment to two domestic banks and is willing to take responsibility for their $88 million foreign currency lending to Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) without any restructuring.
The handling of the foreign currency loan contrasts with the restructuring of PIA’s Rs243 billion domestic debt, which is being extended for 10 years at reduced interest rates.
Government sources informed The Express Tribune that this decision will impose an additional burden on the exchequer in the shape of high interest rates in dollar terms and exchange rate risks over the next five years.
Unlike the commercial banks’ domestic lending of Rs243 billion being restructures, the finance ministry has declined advice to convert the $88 million or Rs25 billion foreign loan component into domestic currency, said sources. The government has decided to take over the responsibility of the Rs268 billion commercial banks’ debt to PIA, including the Rs25 billion or $88 million foreign currency loan. A consortium of the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) and Habib Bank Limited (HBL) provided a $88 million loan to PIA at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 5.4%, equivalent to around 11% in dollar terms.
Out of the $88 million, NBP lent $74 million, and HBL’s share was $14 million. The government is considering partially settling the $88 million, with the remaining $53 million to be managed by the government holding company. The Ministry of Finance will then handle the principal and interest payments on the foreign loan, assuming the risks of high interest rates and currency devaluation, said the sources. Despite proposals to reduce the interest rate to 6% in dollar terms and convert the foreign currency loan into domestic financing to save additional interest expenses and avoid exchange rate risks, the Ministry of Finance has not endorsed these suggestions.

Sources mentioned that the Ministry of Finance is unwilling to reschedule the terms of this financing, unlike the treatment given to the Rs243 billion domestic lending by various banks.
The foreign loan facility will be settled in five years instead of 10, with the government paying an interest rate equal to SOFR plus 5.4%, close to 11% in dollar terms.
When contacted, Ministry of Finance Spokesperson, Qamar Abbasi stated, “The proposed transfer of the $88 million foreign currency loan is intended to be recorded on the books of Hold Co, similar to the rest of PIA’s commercial debt.” Abbasi mentioned that discussions regarding the terms of transfer are ongoing with the banks.
“Various proposals are being considered, including converting the loan from foreign currency to PKR, retaining it in its current form, or a combination of both,” Abbasi explained. He further added that the final decision will be made after considering the requirements of the domestic foreign exchange market and determining the appropriate level of foreign exchange risk to be assumed by Hold Co.
The government and commercial banks have already agreed on a Rs268 billion debt restructuring plan. Sources said that the new term sheet is expected to be signed by the government and banks within the week, paving the way for the issuance of No Objection Certificates by the banks to divide PIA into two and transfer its approximately Rs610 billion debt to a new holding company.
After obtaining the NOC, PIA will file a scheme of arrangement with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) to establish the new holding company. This move will shift the burden of PIA’s inefficiency onto taxpayers but will remove an obstacle to its privatisation.
Under the new term sheet, the government will use proceeds from the PIA sale for principal payments, resorting to the budget if funds are insufficient. In return, banks will accept a 10-year debt rollover with a 12% annual interest rate, resulting in Rs32 billion in annual interest payments from 2024-25 onwards.
This arrangement means banks will receive over Rs300 billion in interest payments over a decade, exceeding their outstanding stocks of Rs268 billion. The total pay-out to banks at a 12% interest rate will be Rs573 billion over 10 years, said the sources.
Principal payments will be made from privatisation proceeds and the sale of other fixed assets. If, however, no proceeds are available, the finance ministry will settle the payments from the budget. The total outstanding debt of the airline is Rs825 billion, and the privatisation ministry and PIA will need no objection certificates from the CAA and FBR to file a scheme of arrangement with the SECP.
The Privatisation Commission board approved the transaction structure to sell a minimum of 51% stake after cleansing its balance sheet by transferring almost three-fourths of the Rs825 billion to a new company.
The government has informed the IMF of its plans to sell PIA by June this year.
Sources said that any decision to accept the $88 million loan in foreign currency will have significant budgetary implications, as the rupee-dollar parity is expected to fluctuate over the next five years.
