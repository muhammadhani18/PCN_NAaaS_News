0,Food prices skyrocket ahead of Ramazan,Concerns mount over apparent lack of price control measures,"As the holy month of Ramazan is approaching fast, a new storm of food inflation has lashed the city and shaken the nerves of the people of Rawalpindi city. The prices of all items have been increased by 30% in the context of Iftar.
The prices of vegetables, fruits, dates, gram flour, pulses, ghee, white gram, chicken and meat have increased dramatically. The prices of dates, a regular item for breaking fast, have jacked up to the highest rate of Rs800 per kg, and gram flour is being sold at Rs300 per kg. The prices of dates and gram flour and dates are expected to increase further next week.
Live chicken is being sold at Rs475 per kg, chicken meat Rs650 per kg, eggs Rs250 per dozen, mutton Rs2,200 per kg, beef Rs1,200 per kg, white chickpeas Rs400 per kg, black gram Rs350 per kg, red beans Rs380 per kg, lentils Rs300 per kg, lentil mash Rs510 per kg, and potato is being sold in Rs45 to Rs50 per kg.

President of Anjuman Tajaran Sabzi Mandi, Ghulam Qadir Mir says that as Ramazan nears, the wholesale markets lack a supply of vegetables and fruits. The supply of pulses is even not in full quantity.
The Ramazan shopping is expected to start next week. Due to the low supply of eatables, the prices of vegetables, fruits and grocery items are much more likely to increase to a record this year in Ramazan, leaving the citizens under acute financial stress.
And if the prices of petroleum products are also increased in Ramazan, the price control mechanism would flop. It appears that the Rawalpindi district administration has [apparently] no price control strategy ahead of the holy month.
Flower price hike
On the other hand, flower sellers also increased the prices of fresh flowers and flower petals on the eve of Shab-e-Barat. The people buy flowers to place on the graves of their near and dear ones.
In the open market, flower petals were sold at a record price of Rs600 per kg and fresh flowers at Rs650 per kg. A large number of citizens, who went to the cemeteries to buy flower petals for praying on the graves of their loved ones, were forced to buy flower petals at a record-high price.
The sellers charged Rs600 per kg for rose petals, Rs550 per kg for mixed leaves of various wildflowers including roses and chrysanthemums, Rs700 per kg for fresh rose petals, Rs500 for normal dry flower wreath and Rs1000 for fancy wreath, Rs1,800 for wreath of fresh flowers, and sold a packet of incense sticks in Rs250.
Flower seller Asghar Abbasi said that the prices have shot up due to rising demand for flowers and flower petals on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat and wedding season before Ramazan.

1,British HC promises climate financing,She pointed out that Pakistan is ranked eighth among the countries most affected by this problem,"At the Annual Inter-School Business Competition held in the capital, British High Commissioner Jane Marriott expressed her willingness to collaborate with the newly elected government, especially in the area of climate financing.
She said this while speaking to The Express Tribune at the closing ceremony of the event which was organised in collaboration with Prince Trust International and Seed Ventures in the British High Commission Islamabad on Saturday.
She said, “Pakistani children have a lot of talent. I have spent the whole afternoon today with seven teams of kids from all over the country who are between the ages of 14 and 18 and their business ideas are so great. Pakistan should use this talent.”
Talking about climate change, the British High Commissioner said climate change and its dangers were a big problem. She pointed out that Pakistan has no role in creating this problem, but it is ranked eighth among the countries most affected by this problem. Moreover, it ranks 32nd in terms of preparedness to deal with the harmful effects of climate change.
“To meet these challenges, money is needed, which Pakistan cannot acquire alone, so we will work with the caretaker government and the incoming government for climate financing.”

2,Ministry to handle pension cases online,Teachers and non-teaching staff are expected to benefit from the digital process,"The Punjab School Education Department is set to implement an online system for handling all pension-related cases starting from March 1.
The pilot project will be initiated in ten districts of the province including Rawalpindi during the first phase, with a complete transition to online processing in all 42 districts by July 1, 2024, as announced in a circular from the ministry of education. The move aims to eliminate manual acceptance of pension cases in the designated districts, a step welcomed by teacher organisations.
Teachers bodies believe that online filing of pension cases will effectively combat corruption and bribery.
Teachers and non-teaching staff are expected to benefit from the digital process, eliminating the need for physical visits to offices and reducing associated distress. The online pension system will commence initially in South Punjab, with a dedicated app already released for the project following a successful trial. The entire process, including the scrutiny of pension documents and obtaining pension approval, will be conducted through the online platform.
Leaders of teacher organisations, Muhammad Shafiq Bhalwalia and Basharat Iqbal Raja, commend the education department for the decision to transition to an online system, considering it a positive step for the education sector.

3,‘Raise tobacco taxes to curb smoking’,Int’l survey says annual economic costs attributable to smoking-related diseases,"Health activists on Wednesday highlighted the critical need for raising tobacco taxes, diverting the money to be spent on healthcare infrastructure and health initiatives in the country and minimising smoking, especially among the youth.
They also underscored that such measures are indispensable for generating significant revenue streams crucial for funding essential public services and bolstering the economy.
In a press release issued by the Society for the Protection of the Rights of Child (SPARC), the Country Head of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (CTFK), Malik Imran Ahmed emphasised the pivotal role of heightened cigarette taxes in deterring smoking, particularly among the youth and individuals with lower incomes.
By instituting annual increments in cigarette taxes, policymakers can effectively curtail tobacco consumption by rendering cigarettes less affordable over time, he said, and added that this strategic approach holds the promise of substantially ameliorating public health outcomes by mitigating smoking-related diseases and reducing healthcare expenditures, he maintained.
Imran also shed light on the staggering economic toll of smoking in Pakistan, which amounts to Rs615.07 billion ($3.85 billion), equivalent to 1.6% of the country's GDP. Notably, the economic costs of smoking far surpass the revenues generated by the tobacco industry, exacerbating this gap annually.

He further referenced data from an international survey revealing that the aggregate annual economic costs attributable to smoking-related diseases and deaths, along with those associated with the three primary non-communicable diseases, collectively amount to 1.6% and 1.15% of Pakistan's GDP, respectively. This alarming trend underscores the urgent imperative for escalating cigarette taxes annually to alleviate the strain on Pakistan's GDP, necessitating prompt governmental action, Imran maintained.
Dr Khalil Ahmad, the Programme Manager at the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (SPARC), elaborated on the multifaceted implications of escalating cigarette taxes.
Highlighting the profound impact of tobacco-related health issues on children and marginalised communities, Dr Khalil emphasised the urgent need for proactive measures to mitigate these challenges.
He stressed that by augmenting cigarette taxes, the government could effectively curb smoking rates among youth, thereby safeguarding their health and well-being.

4,Police beatings spark outrage,Distressing footages show cops torturing youths in Rawalpindi,"In a shocking incident of police brutality in Rawalpindi, a video has surfaced depicting a police officer brutally assaulting a young man inside a police station.
The distressing footage shows ASI Shehzad torturing the youth in the presence of other detainees.
The incident reportedly occurred at Waris Khan police station, where the youth had been taken into custody on charges of kite flying.
City Police Officer (CPO) Rawalpindi Khalid Hamdani promptly took notice of the incident and, in response, dismissed the police official involved, ordered his arrest and initiated legal proceedings against him.
Instances of police brutality in Rawalpindi have been on the rise, with this latest incident adding to the growing concerns about the conduct of law enforcement officers in the region.
The video reveals ASI Shehzad using a hammer to strike the detained youth on the head and body, accompanied by verbal abuse.
In a disturbing turn of events, ASI Baraish, another officer, is seen violently twisting the arm of another youth, causing him to fall in pain. The constable is then observed forcefully grabbing the young man's hair and beard.
Upon receiving reports of this serious incident, CPO Rawalpindi Khalid Hamdani took action, suspending ASI Shehzad and ordering an inquiry led by SP Rawal Faisal Saleem. Subsequently, a case was registered against the ASI under police orders.

Rawalpindi CPO emphasised a zero-tolerance policy towards police abuse, underscoring the gravity of the situation.
It's noteworthy that this incident follows a previous case where the nominated Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz took notice of the mistreatment of a Taxila woman by the police, resulting in the dismissal of the responsible officer.
In another distressing incident in Sadiqabad, Rawalpindi, police and Dolphin Force personnel were captured on video torturing youths in public.
The incident, which occurred three days prior, involved the police and Dolphin Force personnel assaulting young boys on the street. The video also showed a mother coming out of her house to intervene and protect her children, while gunshots fired by a police officer added to the chaos.
After the video went viral, the police issued a statement claiming that the youths had resisted arrest, although this explanation surfaced only after public outrage.
Sadiqabad SHO Anwarul Haq was seen in the video arriving at the scene to restore order.
This incident marks the fourth instance of Dolphin Force and police personnel being involved in violence in the Sadiqabad police station area.
The police officials maintained that, on February 23, the accused youths engaged in aerial firing and resisted arrest during the Basant festival. As a result, six individuals were apprehended, and weapons were seized.
These incidents of police violence highlight a growing concern for the safety and rights of civilians in Rawalpindi, prompting authorities to take immediate action to address and rectify the alarming situation.

5,WASA tightens noose around defaulters,Forms dedicated teams to recover outstanding dues,"The Rawalpindi Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) has formed five teams to recover millions of rupees in outstanding dues from 16,000 consumers who failed to secure relief from the Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi Bench regarding the escalated commercial tariff for water supply and sewage services.
According to a spokesperson for the civic agency, a comprehensive plan has been devised to initiate First Information Reports (FIR) against the defaulters while simultaneously disconnecting their water supply connections.
He said the newly appointed WASA Managing Director Muhammad Saleem Ashraf has implemented a zero-tolerance policy to enhance revenue.
Moreover, in December 2023, Rs100 million were successfully retrieved from consumers of water supply and sewage services. This positive trend continued into January 2024, with a recovery amounting to Rs120 million.
The tariff hike prompted resistance from consumers in both domestic and commercial sectors, with a majority of the non-payments emanating from commercial consumers who sought relief through legal channels.
However, the Lahore High Court’s Pindi Bench, in response to an appeal by 16,000 commercial consumers, redirected the case to the Secretary Housing Punjab.

Consequently, the WASA MD received explicit instructions to adhere to established regulations, leading to the formation of five specialised teams for the recovery of outstanding amounts from commercial customers.
A stern notice has been issued to all private schools, hotels, restaurants, and other commercial establishments, emphasising the imperative to settle outstanding debts promptly or face legal consequences. Simultaneously, a revenue recovery review meeting endorsed the decision to file FIRs against defaulters, individuals involved in illegal connections, and those obstructing the revenue recovery process. Presiding over the meeting, WASA MD Muhammad Saleem Ashraf underscored the need for relentless actions against all defaulters, including the discontinuation of sewage and water connections.
He affirmed that FIRs would be filed against defaulters engaged in illegal water connections and interference with government operations. Furthermore, MD Ashraf emphasised the daily review of revenue inspectors' performance, advocating strict disciplinary measures against those exhibiting negligence in revenue collection. He emphasised that there is no room for dishonest or idle workers within WASA.
The revenue recovery review meeting witnessed the participation of key figures, including DMD Finance Aamir Ashfaq Qureshi, Director of Finance and Revenue Tahir Bashir Mirza, deputy directors of revenue, and revenue staff, indicating a comprehensive approach to address the financial challenges faced by WASA.
