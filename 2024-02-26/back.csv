0,SC seeks madrassas’ help in Mubarak Sani case,Three-member bench issues notice to CII and other institutes,"A three-member bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, sought assistance from religious institutions on a petition filed by the Punjab government for the review of the Mubarak Ahmad Sani case judgment.
The Punjab government’s petition said that Article 20 of the Constitution was not fully explained in para 9 of the judgment, therefore, a wrong impression had prevailed. It added that religious freedom was not unlimited under Article 20.
“We also consider it appropriate to issue notices along with the copy of the order dated February 6, 2024 to the following institutions to seek their assistance with regard to the Injunctions of Islam,” said a court order issued after the hearing.
The notices were issued to Council of Islamic Ideology (CII); Jamia Darululoom, Karachi; Jamia Imdadia, Faisalabad; Jamia Naeemia, Karachi; Jamia Muhammadia Ghousia, Bhera; Jamia Salafia, Faisalabad; Jamiatul Multazir, Lahore; Jamia Urwat-ul-Wusqa, Lahore; Quran Academy, Lahore; and Al-Mawrid, Lahore.
“In case anyone else wants to submit a written opinion for the guidance of this Court they may also do so. All written opinions to be submitted within three weeks from today. To be fixed thereafter,” added the court order issued by the chief justice.
According to the order, Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui filed an application on behalf of the Jamat-e-Islami Pakistan, stating that they might be arrayed as a party to these proceedings because the order dated 6 February 2024 passed by this court required review.
“Let all such applications be entertained by the office and put up alongwith this review petition on the next date of hearing,” the order said. “However, all others, including those who want to be arrayed as parties, may file their written opinions with regard to the said order to the extent only of the interpretation of Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and/or the Injunctions of Islam.”

1,PTI dismisses Maryam as ‘fake CM’,Alleges Maryam handpicked in ‘unconstitutional assembly’ through 'rigged polls',"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Monday vehemently criticised the election of Maryam Nawaz as Punjab's chief minister, accusing those in the ""unconstitutional Punjab Assembly"" of handpicking a ""fake chief minister"" through rigged results.
PTI alleged that the Sharif family, notorious for years of plundering the country and stashing wealth abroad, was once again in action in Punjab, trying to set the stage for another round of looting.
In a statement, the PTI spokesperson expressed disdain, stating it was ""unconstitutional and shameful"" for the police to impose a curfew outside the Punjab Assembly, preventing nominated PTI-backed candidates and elected members from participating in the meeting.
The spokesperson said that after the alleged theft of the people's mandate, the sanctity of the House is now being trampled upon.
The spokesperson stated that a woman who failed to secure a single seat, even amid alleged state oppression and rigging, should reconsider her aspirations against the people's will.
He accused Maryam Nawaz, who has been convicted in corruption cases worth billions, of prioritising the Sharif family's wealth over the welfare of the nation.
The PTI warned that the people of Punjab would not tolerate insults to their mandate in the case of an allegedly unconstitutional and fake chief minister.
The party spokesperson asserted that an unconstitutional government established through a rigged election would not last long and predicted its eventual collapse under its own weight.
Maryam Nawaz, the newly-elected chief minister, took the oath of office shortly after securing 220 votes in the provincial assembly, becoming the first woman chief executive in Pakistan's history.
The opposition candidate, Rana Aftab Ahmad, did not receive any votes as the party boycotted the elections after being reportedly silenced.
Meanwhile, addressing a news conference outside the Punjab Assembly, PTI leader Shaukat Basra said that the ‘fraudsters’ not only stole the people’s mandate, but they were treating the voters ruthlessly and also demanded the immediate resignation of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC).

He was flanked by a large number of PTI-backed candidates claiming to have won the recent elections in their respective constituencies. All the losing candidates felt cheated and showed Form 45, in their hands, proof of their victory.
Basra observed that the denial of the party symbol ‘bat’ made the ground for the rigging, adding that the ‘fake chief minister’ along with her ‘fake legislators’ were elected in the Punjab Assembly. He claimed that Maryam Nawaz had lost the election to PTI-backed candidate Meher Sharafat.
He averred that they (the PML-N) claimed that a deal had been made (with the establishment), but they did not seek the people's support. “Today, Pakistan was being ridiculed after the farce elections. After this sham election, there will be chaos in the country and subsequently, its economy will deteriorate and become unmanageable,” he added.
He castigated the Sharif family for taking turns (in the Prime Minister's office); they are “seasoned money launderers”. He added that they (the Sharif family) have cheated on the rights of the people.
He claimed that the PTI has a two-thirds majority in the Punjab Assembly after winning 250 seats.
“Hence, we will call an Assembly’s session, which will be attended by our elected candidates, and we will elect a chief minister, a speaker and a deputy speaker,” he added.
Talking about the rigging claims of former Commissioner Rawalpindi Liaquat Ali Chattha, Basra said that he (Chattha) took the name of the Chief Justice of Pakistan and the Chief Election Commissioner; thus, they request the Chief Justice to constitute a full court and excuse himself from it. “The full court proceedings should be shown live on TV,” he added.
Moreover, PTI leader Naeem Haider Panjutha told the media that their candidates were leading the polls with a margin of over 100,000 votes in PP-71 and still he lost the election. He also claimed that his voters registered in his constituency were transferred to other constituencies while their polling agents were not allowed access (to the polling stations) so that the results could be rigged in the evening.
“Also, in my constituency all ballot boxes were broken; when ‘they’ realised that I was leading the polls, the final result was altered to declare my opponent victorious by 5,000 votes,” he added.
He also complained that they have filed petitions against rigging at various platforms but all have been rejected.
PTI-backed candidate Ruba Omar also claimed, “My results were rigged to defeat me; I had a lead of 20,000 votes till midnight, but by the next morning, the results were rigged and we had lost the elections.” She also highlighted that they have filed complaints against the rigging and they will continue with our legal battle.
Another PTI-backed candidate, Awais Anjum, claimed that according to his Form 45, he bagged 33,000 votes while his opponent got 32,000. He pointed out that this was the constituency where the PTI’s vote bank was less than his opponent’s, but still in the recent elections the people came out to vote for the PTI founder chairman. He claimed that like his opponent Wasim Qadir, “some people tried to manage me, but I flatly refused, which was the cause behind his defeat”.

3,PML-N agrees on names for Balochistan key slots,"Party to nominate Sheikh Jaffar Mandokhail for governor’s post, Rahila Durrani for PA speaker","The newly elected members of PML-N Balochistan on Sunday agreed on the names of Sheikh Jaffar Mandokhail for the post of the governor and Rahila Hameed Durrani for the slot of the provincial assembly speaker.
The names were decided during a meeting of the PML-N Parliamentary Group, chaired by its provincial chief Jaffar Mandokhail, held for discussing the government formation in Balochistan.
The huddle was attended by former Balochistan chief minister Jam Mir Kamal Khan Alyani from NA-257, Rahila Durrani, Sardar Abdul Rahman Khetran from PB-4, Saleem Ahmed Khosa from PB-15, and Mohammad Asim Kurd Gello from PB-12 among others.
The participants of the meeting said the PML-N should receive more important ministries and adviser slots in the Balochistan cabinet.
Some of them expressed their reservations over the inclusion of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) in the provincial government.
A day earlier, Balochistan Governor Malik Abdul Wali Kakar convened a session of the new provincial assembly on February 28.
As per the schedule, the newly elected members of the Balochistan Assembly will take oath during the maiden session of the provincial legislature.
The outgoing speaker of the Balochistan Assembly, Mir Jan Muhammad Jamali, will preside over the session and swear in the newly elected MPAs.
After the new MPAs are sworn in, the schedule for the election of the provincial legislature’s speaker and deputy speaker will be announced.
The four-party alliance – comprising the BNP-M, PkMAP, the National Party (NP) and Hazara Democratic Party (HDP) -- has planned to stage a protest demonstration outside the provincial assembly on February 28.
""We will protest [against the alleged polls rigging] on this day"", Dawood Changezi, the central leader of the HDP told The Express Tribune.
He said an important meeting of the alliance was under way to devise a strategy for the protest.
Also on Saturday, PML-N president and its nominee for the premier’s position Shehbaz Sharif met a delegation of the party’s leaders and newly elected lawmakers from Balochistan in Lahore.
Shehbaz appreciated the passion of the PML-N’s newly elected MNAs, MPAs, and leaders.
The PML-N president expressed his gratitude to them for their efforts, which were helping in the emergence of political stability in the country.
He vowed that they would all work together sincerely for the development of Pakistan and its province Balochistan.
Shehbaz stressed the need for putting the interests of country first instead of political ones.
During the meeting, issues in connection with the government formation in Balochistan were discussed.
The PML-N leaders from Balochistan informed the party president about their efforts to reach out to other politicians in the province.

4,Nine Pakistanis injured in UAE warehouse fire,All are residents of the districts of Benazirabad in Sindh and Dera Ghazi Khan in Punjab,"Nine Pakistanis were injured on Sunday in a fire that erupted in a warehouse in the Ajman city of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The warehouse contained stocks of hand sanitizers and perfume.
According to Arab media, the injured—all employees at the warehouse—were transferred to Khalifa bin Zayed Hospital. Two of them, who were seriously burned, were later shifted to a hospital in Abu Dhabi.
The injured individuals were identified as Guldad son of Shah Nawaz Dharee, Nawab son of Shah Nawaz, Imam Bakhsh son of Khuda Bakhsh Solangi, Muhammad Akram son of Dawood Khan, Shahid son of Mumtaz, Zahoor son of Muhammad Hayat, Sikander son of Abdul Rahim, Akbar son of Khemisa Khan, and Ijaz.
All are residents of the districts of Benazirabad in Sindh and Dera Ghazi Khan in Punjab.
Officials of the Welfare Wing of Pakistan's Consul General in Dubai visited the hospital immediately after the incident and have been in constant contact with the relevant authorities.
Pakistan's Ambassador to the UAE, Faisal Niaz Tirmizi, expressed regret over the incident, extended well wishes for the recovery of the injured, and assured that every possible assistance would be provided to them in this unfortunate incident.

5,SJC to hear ex-judge Naqvi’s case on 29th,Council will record statements of prosecution witnesses,"Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa has summoned the meeting of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on February 29 to consider the complaints of misconduct against resigned top court judge Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi.
It has been learnt that the council's meeting will be held to record the statements of prosecution witnesses in Naqvi’s case.
Perhaps Naqvi will be the first judge, who is facing proceedings of misconduct after his resignation.
Last week, an SC larger bench by a majority of 4 to 1 held that the proceedings, which had already been initiated by the SJC against a judge, shall not abate on his resignation or retirement.
“It is the prerogative of the SJC to proceed with the matter accordingly,” read the order.
However, one section of lawyers is expressing serious concerns over the majority order.
Article 209 of the Constitution clearly states that the SJC can proceed against a judge.
But those lawyers argue that a constitutional amendment is required to extend the jurisdiction of the SJC to proceed against judges who have either retired or resigned.
They are also comparing the order with the decision wherein Article 63-A of the Constitution was being interpreted.
However, several other lawyers believe that in order to restore the people’s trust, it is essential that the SJC should proceed against a judge who retires before the council's final decision in order to secure the benefit of pension.
In view of the judicial order, the proceedings of misconduct against Naqvi will be valid. Earlier, he wrote a letter to the SJC questioning the proceedings of misconduct against him.
It is likely that the SJC will conclude the proceedings in the next couple of hearings as two members -- namely Justice Sardar Tariq Masood and Lahore High Court Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti -- are retiring next month. One other member, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, has also been recommended for his appointment as an SC judge by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan on February 23.
Former SC judge Naqvi had expressed his lack of trust in SJC members including CJP Isa.
He himself requested for a public hearing.  He also submitted his response to the show-cause notices issued to him. When the SJC summoned witnesses in the case, Naqvi tendered his resignation.

7,"PPPP’s Sharmila, Sehar elected on reserved seats","The two had already won the direct elections on February 8, from NA-209 Sanghar and NA-202 Khairpur","The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) notified Sharmila Faruqui and Sehar Kamran of the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) as members of National Assembly on the reserved seats for women in placs of Shazia Marri and Nafisa Shah, who relinquished their seats on Sunday.
Marri and Shah were on the PPPP’s priority lists for the reserved seats for women and were allocated seats by the ECP last week.
Since, the two had already won the direct elections on February 8, from NA-209 Sanghar and NA-202 Khairpur, respectively, therefore, they relinquished the reserved seats.
According to the ECP notification both Sharmila Faruqui and Sehar Kamran had been declared elected on the reserved seats held by Marri and Shah. The ECP also issued a separate notification of victory of independent candidate Khizer Hussain Mazari’s for a Punjab Assembly seat, PP-297.
