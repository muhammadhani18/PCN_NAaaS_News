0,Controversy engulfs convening of NA session,President reluctant to greenlight inaugural session over reserved seats as PML-N and PPP decry hold-up,"A brewing storm of controversy swirled over the impending National Assembly session on Sunday after Dr Arif Alvi appeared reluctant to greenlight its inaugural proceedings, ostensibly over reserved seats allocation – drawing sharp criticism from the coalition of PML-N and PPP.
The tug-of-war intensified as the PML-N contended that, following the expiration of the February 29 deadline, the speaker could autonomously convene the session. However, a former official from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) dismissed this assertion.
The PTI-leader-turned-president was sent a summary by the caretaker parliamentary affairs ministry, urging the initiation of the NA session on Monday.
Despite the plea, President Alvi utilized his constitutional authority to defer the session by 15 days, citing apprehensions about the completion of the reserved seats allocation process.
Nevertheless, the president received information that, in accordance with the Constitution, the NA session must be summoned on February 29. In addition, he was apprised that the constitution dictates the necessity of convening the NA session within 21 days of the elections.
Subsequently, on March 1, the papers for the NA speaker will be presented to the assembly secretariat. Following this, on March 2, the election for the new speaker and their deputy will take place.
Similarly, the process of submitting the nomination papers for the election of the prime minister will take place on March 3. The election for the post of the premier will be held in the NA on March 4. The election of the new president will be conducted by the ECP on March 9.
It was also mandatory to convene the session of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly by February 29.
The ECP has allocated reserved seats to political parties but not granted any to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) after the PTI-backed independent candidates merged with it for this very purpose.
On February 21, the SIC approached the ECP, seeking the allocation of reserved seats in the NA and provincial legislatures after the PTI sealed its alliance with the council.
However, the ECP has yet to decide whether to entertain the request or not.
The SIC had neither applied for any reserved seat to the ECP – a requirement under the law – nor had it filed a priority list of candidates before the elections.
Speaker’s authority
Speaking to the media outside the Punjab Assembly in Lahore, PML-N stalwart Senator Ishaq Dar on Sunday said if the president did not convene the inaugural session despite the submission of a summary to him for this purpose, its speaker could constitutionally do so by himself on February 29.
The PML-N leader said it was clearly mentioned in the Constitution that if the new NA session was not called, the speaker had the authority to convene it on the 21st day.
He added that according to the constitutional 21-day deadline, February 29 was the last date.
Dar elaborated that even in the provinces if the governor did not convene the session of the provincial legislature, the same principle would apply there.
Addressing a news conference at the PML-N’s secretariat in Lahore’s Model Town, party leader Attaullah Tarar claimed that the issue of the NA session was being deliberately made controversial and there was no justification to ruin the matter after the notification of the reserved seats.
Tarar further maintained that the PTI had always tried to derail democracy in Pakistan and its founding chairman Imran Khan writing a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), urging the global lender to give the poll results a thorough once-over before cutting any new cheques for Islamabad, was a proof of the party’s involvement in conspiracies against the country.
In a related development, PPP leader Shazia Marri said the president was “misusing his authority” by delaying the summoning of the new NA session.
“It is necessary for the president to call a session of the National Assembly without delay on the summary of the [interim] prime minister,” Marri said in a statement, adding that Dr Alvi should follow the Constitution rather than the “orders of one individual”.
The PPP leader further said Dr Alvi was the same president who had tried to “unconstitutionally” dissolve the NA in the past as well. She continued that Dr Alvi’s “violation of the Constitution” and “misuse of office” would remain a part of history.
“The National Assembly elections have been completed. The president is bound to convene [its] session.”
However, Kanwar Dilshad, a former secretary of the ECP, refuted the claim of Dar that the NA speaker had the power to convene the session by himself.
He said if the president was refraining from calling the NA session, one-third of its members could write to the speaker for its requisition.
“But the question which then arises is that since they [elected representatives] have not taken the oath yet, then the speaker cannot requisition the session. So it seems that the speaker does not have the power, the president does,” he maintained.
However, the ex-ECP official conceded that the Constitution clearly stated that it was mandatory for the sessions of the NA and provincial legislatures to be called 21 days after the general elections were held.
He continued that the president should summon the sessions within 21 days – that was on February 29.
In a parallel development, PPP Parliamentary Leader Ali Haider Gillani raises eyebrows over President Alvi's alleged misuse of the office for personal vendettas and opposition agendas.
In a statement issued here on Sunday, he emphasised the importance of upholding democratic principles and stated that the presidency is once again being used for undemocratic actions.
He highlighted the constitutional obligation, as per Article 91, that the president is bound to convene a session of the National
Assembly within the prescribed time frame on the advice of the premier.
Gillani expressed dismay over the continuation of President Alvi's tenure beyond its expiry, suggesting a bias towards alternate agendas. He urged for the preservation of the presidency's sanctity, condemning any indication of bias in Arif Alvi's recent statements.

1,Vacant NA seats can’t delay presidential poll,Experts say Dr Alvi should summon session instead of waiting for allocation of reserved seats,"Amid reports that President Dr Arif Alvi wants the reserved seats allocated before summoning the inaugural session of the National Assembly, experts said on Sunday that the lack of completion of the electoral college in the lower house of parliament would not affect the constitutionality of the election for the head of the state so he should not delay the process.
Nevertheless, the outgoing president appears to have once again deliberately refrained himself from signing a summary seeking the summoning of the NA session, inviting criticism from not just the political parties but experts as well that Dr Alvi has been repeating something that has been a blot on his stay in the office: delaying the approval of his opponents’ summaries.
“Even if a large number of seats are vacant in each legislature, the assembly is intact,” said Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob.
“It will not impact the constitutionality of the president’s election.”
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is reportedly gearing up to hold the election for the office of the president by March 9 -- two days before the retirement of half of the senators after completing their six-year term.
In fact, the Pildat chief said Article 41(4) of the Constitution referred to postponing the presidential election only if the NA was dissolved.
“It doesn’t even refer to the provincial assemblies.”
Arguing that narrow technicalities should be dispensed with, Mehboob was of the view that the ECP should resolve the issue of the pending reserved seats by allotting them to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) and if not, they should be distributed among other political parties.
Renowned constitutional expert Hafiz Ehsaan Ahmad Khokhar also observed that vacant seats in the NA would not affect the schedule of the presidential election.
“It is not for him [the president] to be involved [in the matter of the reserved seats] as the ECP acts independently,” he explained.
The expert elaborated that the president was constitutionally bound to summon the NA session under Article 91(2) of the Constitution within 21 days from the day of holding the general elections.
“He [the president] cannot withhold the summary; cannot keep it pending and cannot return it as well as the advice of the [interim] prime minister as he is bound under Article 48 and 91 of the Constitution [to act on it],” Khokhar said.
“The president cannot stop the holding of the NA session for the formation of a new government.”
Referring to Article 91(2) of the Constitution, Khokhar said the president could not deviate from this constitutional provision and its command obligations.
“This extraordinary ordinary session is not dependent upon the discretion of the president or the prime minister.”
According to the expert, the president is bound as per Article 48(1) of the Constitution to act on the advice of the caretaker prime minister, and he has no legal option to deviate or keep the matter pending as it has to be carried out within 21 days of the general polls as per Article 91.
As for returning the summary, Khokhar said the president had some flexible mandate for legislation under Article 75 of the Constitution but not at all under Article 91 in the present scenario on any other pretext.
“If the president refuses, then the NA secretary can be asked under the rules for summoning the session. This provides the NA secretary [the authority] to issue a gazette notification. In the present situation, the NA secretary can initiate the summoning process of the session under Article 91(2) of the Constitution,” he explained.
The expert noted that the longest-serving president could have ended his innings at a positive note as he could not stop the process in any case.
Instead, Khokhar added that Dr Alvi decided to repeat what he had been famous for: delaying the signing of the summaries of those belonging to his opponents’ camp.

2,Speaker overrides Alvi to summon NA session on 29th,Ashraf acts after president returns govt summary for inaugural sitting,"President Dr Arif Alvi again struck a defiant posture on Monday as he returned a caretaker government’s summary for convening the inaugural session of the National Assembly, prompting Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf to call the maiden sitting of the lower house of parliament on February 29.
Alvi, whose presidency is coming to a conclusion within a few weeks, emphasised that he would only approve the summary if the issue of reserved seats for women and minorities was resolved and distributed among the parties, as per law.
However, soon after the president returned the summary, the National Assembly Speaker reportedly summoned the inaugural session on February 29. On that day, the newly-elected lawmakers would take an oath to mark the beginning of the tenure of the assembly.
According to Article 91(2) of the Constitution, the National Assembly “shall meet on the 21st day following the day on which a general election to the assembly is held, unless sooner summoned” by the president.
Since Alvi returned the summary, as confirmed by officials of the Presidency, National Assembly officials said that the speaker had no other option but to call the session. However, a formal statement about summoning the session has yet to be issued.
Renowned constitutional experts as well as those who keenly observe the parliamentary activities have already conveyed in unequivocal terms that the president was constitutionally bound to summon the assembly session under Article 91(2) within 21 days from the day of holding the general elections.
“He [the president] cannot withhold the summary; he cannot keep it pending and cannot return it, as well as the advice of the prime minister, as he is bound by Articles 48 and 91 of the Constitution [to act on it],” Hafiz Ehsaan Ahmad Khokhar, a law expert, said. “The president cannot stop the session.”

He explained that the president could not deviate from this constitutional provision and its command obligations as the National Assembly’s extraordinary ordinary session was not dependent upon the discretion of the president or the prime minister.
Khokhar maintained that the president had no mandate to delay things as defined in Article 75 of the Constitution about the president’s assent to bills. He said that the National Assembly secretary could initiate the summoning of the session under Article 91(2) upon the president’s refusal.
On the day of the inaugural session of the National Assembly, the schedule for the election of a new speaker will be released. It is expected that papers for the posts of speaker and deputy speaker will be submitted on March 1, and the voting will take place on March 2.
After the election of the speaker and deputy speaker, the process for submitting nomination papers for the election of the prime minister is likely to be slated for March 3, followed by the prime minister’s election in the National Assembly on March 4.
Once the new government takes the helm, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is expected to go for the election for the new president on March 9 – just days before half of the senators would complete their six-year term and new senators would be elected.
Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob opined that any vacant seats in the National Assembly would not affect the schedule for the presidential election. “It will not impact the constitutionality of the president’s election,” Mehboob said.

3,"Maryam, Murad seal top slots in Punjab, Sindh","Maryam becomes nation's first CM, Murad scores hat-trick with third consecutive term as Sindh CM","PML-N’s Maryam Nawaz etched her name as the first female chief minister of Punjab on Monday, while PPP’s Murad Ali Shah secured the coveted position in Sindh for the third consecutive time, steering their parties to triumph in the wake of controversial general elections.
Both leaders cemented the PML-N and PPP's rule in Punjab and Sindh, respectively, navigating through boycotts and echoes of rigging allegations.
However, in the political air thick with tension, Maryam and Murad sought to strike conciliatory notes, urging collaboration across party lines.
Maryam pledged a revenge-free tenure in the 371-member Punjab Assembly session boycotted by the opposition Sunni Ittehad Council, backed by jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, while Murad asserted, ""We are never scared of criticism. No one is perfect, but if you don’t criticise, then how would we learn?""
Expressing gratitude, Murad added, ""I want to thank people on both sides and also the people of this province.""
Maryam, beyond being the trailblazing first female chief minister, joined the illustrious ranks of the Sharif family, becoming its fourth member to hold such a position and the first woman from the family to claim the CM seat.
Maryam secured her triumph with 220 votes, while her opponent, Rana Aftab Ahmad of the Sunni Ittehad Council, garnered zero votes due to the boycott.
The session commenced nearly two hours behind the planned schedule due to claims from the SIC that its MPAs were denied entry to the assembly premises. When proceedings eventually commenced at 1pm, 103 SIC lawmakers opted to stage a walkout.
As proceedings began, opposition lawmakers sought time to speak, but Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan focused on the agenda of the CM's election. The opposition boycotted, chanting slogans against PML-N thrice premier Nawaz Sharif.
Maryam, in an attempt to persuade the opposition, requested the speaker to send lawmakers to engage with them. However, as the election process started, the opposition once again boycotted and left the House.
 
'No revenge'
In her victory speech, Maryam directed her focus inward, emphasising the performance of her own party. She asserted that her competition lies in enhancing her party's efficiency rather than engaging in opposition battles.
Taking charge as CM Punjab, her inaugural address in the Punjab Assembly conveyed an open-door policy, welcoming all, especially the opposition, to collaboratively uplift the province by swiftly resolving the challenges faced by the underprivileged masses.
During her hour-and-a-half-long victory speech, Maryam expressed disappointment at the opposition's boycott, holding a framed photo of her late mother Kulsoom. She lamented their absence, stating, “I wish they had been a part of the political and democratic process.”
Expressing sorrow over the opposition lawmakers' departure before the election, Maryam emphasised the importance of staying engaged in the democratic process. Despite political challenges, she thanked her allied parties, Punjab's supportive citizens, and her educators who contributed to her becoming the chief minister.
Addressing the opposition, she said, “The doors of my chamber and heart will always remain open for them as they are for the members of my party.” Maryam clarified her stance, expressing no desire for revenge and harbouring no hatred.
Highlighting the historic nature of her election, Maryam dedicated the victory to all women in the country, emphasising that being a woman or a daughter should not hinder one's dreams. She pledged to launch over two dozen projects and announced immediate orders, including providing free medicines in government hospitals' emergencies and the upcoming launch of an air ambulance.

Murad’s hat-trick
Meanwhile, down in Karachi, Murad Ali Shah clinched his third consecutive term as Sindh's chief minister, securing 112 out of the 148 votes cast. His rival, Ali Khurshidi of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, managed to gather 36 votes.
Addressing the PTI-backed MPAs in the assembly, he said: “We are never scared of criticism, no one is perfect […] but if you don’t criticise, then how would we learn?”
“I want to thank people on both sides and also the people of this province,” he added.
“Throw it out of your minds that Karachi is not a part of Sindh […] it is time to move past this flawed thinking,” he asserted. CM Murad recalled that he had grown up in Karachi and knew the city like the back of his hand.
He also expressed hope that the opposition would play its due part in the assembly.

Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has said his new mission is to provide clean drinking water across the province.
He said Sindh is leading among all provinces when it comes to the provision of free healthcare.
Citing examples of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Gambat Institute of Medical Sciences and other facilities, he stated that people across the country came to Sindh for free medical treatment.
“You ask how we secured votes in Sindh, that is because we have shown our performance to the people,” CM Murad added.
He said he is honoured to take over the position of provincial head for the third consecutive term.
CM Murad also thanked the PPP leadership for supporting and backing him despite numerous challenges.
