0,Reforms in Planning Commission,"PC has not evolved with changing economic, constitutional terrains","Before delving into and trying to answer some of the questions around the efficacy, need of existence, future reform and evolution of the Planning Commission (PC), it may be pertinent to understand the context and circumstances in which the PC came into being.
The PC was officially born in 1953 in the backdrop of the Colombo Plan established by Commonwealth countries, aided and advised by the World Bank. The premise behind creating the PC was that economies require a structured approach to development and government(s) ought to take the lead in the process.
The PC was tasked to develop mathematical models which would identify sectors where investments would yield optimum returns. The Harvard Advisory Group and the World Bank facilitated the PC to come up with various tools including five-year plans. The PC’s key role was to spearhead a consultative process across various ministries to identify profitable investments in identified sectors. The approach also led to public investments through the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
The world’s social, political and economic constructs, approaches and thought processes have evolved substantially since the advent of the PC. While the initial approach adopted by the PC for development may have worked in the 1960s and 1970s, the global ecosystem in general and Pakistan’s economic structure in particular have changed significantly.
This is especially evident since the 1980s and 1990s where there has been a push globally to let the private sector take the lead in economic development. Pakistan’s economic model that the PC was initially set up to serve has changed substantially, however, the commission continues to remain mired in old ways of conducting its business. Further, introduction of the 18th Amendment has made central planning a challenge, with provinces obtaining substantial financial autonomy to carry out their development agendas independently.
Consequently, the PC has not evolved with changing economic and constitutional terrains to be able to make an impact that it used to in its heydays. The overhang of loss-making state-owned entities (SOEs), looking up to the government to dole out subsidies, are some of the extensions of the mindset of the 1960s and 1970s, which remain imbedded not only in the public sector, but the private sector as well.
Archaic mindset and operational interventions, misaligned with modern ground realities, have weakened Pakistan’s fiscal position, resulting in a tepid macroeconomic predicament, leading to loss of investor confidence and investment appetite.
While the PC has a list of functions it is supposed to perform (please refer to the Cabinet Division resolution dated October 30, 2013), it developed a perception as a project appraisal and approving entity only with little focus and conformity with the rest of its functions. The ecosystem viewed it as a conduit to obtain funds for development projects – be they federal, provincial or municipal in nature, without much heed to the core public investment mandate.
Strong political influence diluted the efficacy and implementation of its national and economic plans. Relevant economic departments and technical sections’ capabilities started to erode; political inductions and appointments did not help bring knowledgeable professionals to the forefront.
The influence of political economy can be further corroborated by the fact that before mid-late 1990s, deputy chairmen of PC were primarily either seasoned bureaucrats or eminent economists. However, after mid-late 1990s, there is growing evidence of political figures taking on the office of the deputy chairman. Changing the reporting line of the deputy chairman to the minister of planning, development and special initiatives has further enhanced the influence of political economy.
With the above in the backdrop, the first and primary question becomes whether we need a commission for planning. Given the role of the commission as a central and national coordinating body for national, federal and provincial matters, having the convening power to congregate and debate on cross-cutting topics, sectors and inter-provincial matters, a justification still exists to have a commission.
However, the commission cannot exist in its present form and will not be able to deliver its objectives, perform to its potential and expectations.
If there is a desire to commence the initial reform process and rid the commission of myriad anomalies mentioned above, a number of key changes and interventions will need to be pursued with reform-oriented and impartial mindset:
First, new entity: A new commission should be set up; it will be an arduous task to fix the existing one. The new commission should be enacted, having the full force of the law.
Second, independence: The commission must be independent of the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives or any other ministry. The commission must have its own procedures and rules of operation. It must be positioned as a national commission rather than a federal or provincial commission.
Third, productivity-driven orientation: While the new commission may take some of the objectives mentioned in the cabinet resolution dated October 30, 2013, it ought to be oriented in a way which makes all federal and provincial ministries understand that its mandate pertains to not only PSDP but non-PSDP activities as well.
This aspect is at times not fully understood by many ministries and senior officers; the existing PC is largely seen as a project approving body as mentioned before.
Since private sector needs to take the lead in investment and growth with the government taking a facilitative role, the new PC should be reoriented to approach all sectors, cross-cutting or otherwise, with a view to augmenting productivity of the country and facilitating private sector growth.
The existing technical sector team setup is archaic, outdated, siloed and does not fully appreciate the cross-cutting linkages across various sectors. There are some extremely important areas which are not fully owned by any technical sector team such as the privatisation process and the SOEs.
Both have an exceptional role to play in providing a conducive environment for private sector to thrive.
Fourth, mandate with empowerment to execute and implement: Presently, the PC develops macroeconomic model(s), five-year plans, annual plans and related interventions through PSDP along with formulating policies in consultation with relevant ministries and other stakeholders amongst other activities.
However, once these documents are adopted by the government, associated support required to influence the implementation or steer objectives of the documents remains missing, barring PSDP allocation(s), which are also subject to change.
Merely convening ministries and other stakeholders to iron out issues while helpful, does not achieve the objective in spirit. It must also be fully appreciated that the single biggest factor in ushering investment and growth is a stable macroeconomic environment and data points which are linked with fiscal disciple, national debt management, revenue generation and expenditure, commerce and trade amongst others.
While the existing PC may formulate models and documents for intellectual consumptions, areas mentioned above are largely outside the real influence of the PC.
New commission may emulate the mandate of the existing commission, however, it must have all levers within its influence to steer and execute national macroeconomic model outcomes.
This is the first part of the article. Its second part will appear soon.

1,Maximising zakat’s impact on economy,"Estimate shows zakat worth Rs2,743b, or 4% of GDP, can be collected annually","Zakat, an essential pillar of Islam, holds remarkable promise not only as a religious duty but also as a driver of economic growth and societal welfare.
It is calculated based on one’s accumulated wealth and assets, aiming to distribute resources among the community, particularly benefiting the less fortunate. However, its impact goes beyond charity, offering significant advantages for the economy such as reducing poverty, ensuring fair wealth distribution, and promoting sustainable development.
The global Muslim population, being more than 1.8 billion, indicates a huge potential for zakat. Various reports by reputable international organisations estimate zakat’s annual potential between $200 billion and $1 trillion.
This is a significant amount to play an effective role in the reduction of global poverty and hunger while lifting the economic level of millions.
In Pakistan, with more than 96% Muslim population, there exists a huge potential for zakat, and if the amount is utilised effectively, it can play a meaningful role in the economic development of society.
According to the World Bank, poverty in Pakistan was more than 37% in 2023. This figure can also be attributed to the fact that zakat collection is not according to its true potential.
As per a report issued by the Institute of Policy Studies in March 2023, the estimated zakat collectible annually in Pakistan is more than Rs2,743 billion, approximately equal to 4% of GDP. To put this in perspective, this amount surpasses 28.6% of government’s 2022-23 budget.
If the amount of zakat is collected as per its potential and people are motivated to discharge their religious giving in a timely manner, the estimated potential of zakat in Pakistan would be enough to provide an amount of Rs100,000 to over 27 million individuals.
This transfer of wealth to the most deserving can play a catalyst role in lifting millions above poverty line and motivating them to contribute to the economic activity and well-being of their families.
Read: Zakat crisis deepens
While the promise of zakat is evident, its effective implementation in Pakistan faces several challenges. Despite the vast potential, government collection of zakat remains dismally inadequate.
In Pakistan, zakat is collected by the government through deduction from bank accounts on the first of Ramazan each year. However, in the 2021-22 budget, a mere Rs2.379 billion was collected, a small fraction of the potential.
This highlights the prevailing lack of trust and transparency in the government’s ability to manage zakat funds. The government system of zakat is overshadowed by political interventions, lack of clear SOPs for recipients of zakat, inadequate public disclosures, weaker audits and controls, and absence of professional zakat managers.
To circumvent government shortcomings, most individuals and NRPs turn to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to fulfil their zakat and charity obligations. There are several NGOs, religious institutions, and welfare organisations that are trusted by the donors for their robust and Shariah-compliant zakat and charity systems.
This includes the process of collection, investment, and disbursement of zakat and charity funds. These NGOs and welfare entities are contributing in the area of health, education, poverty alleviation, and different social welfare projects, thus playing an important role and filling the void created by the government zakat system.
While there are good NGOs and welfare entities on one hand, there are many other NGOs, including some well-known names, where the transparency and Shariah compliance of the zakat and charity process are compromised, thus creating doubt in the minds of donors.
A review of financial statements of some NGOs in Pakistan also revealed a disturbing truth that their investment of zakat and charity funds is not Shariah compliant.
They have invested funds in interest-based avenues and government interest-based bonds, a practice contrary to Islamic principles, undermining their credibility and showing their lack of respect for religious guidelines.
A survey by the IBA’s Centre for Excellence in Islamic Finance (CEIF) also revealed that 95% of Pakistanis prefer donating to 100% Shariah-compliant organisations. It is imperative to establish a mechanism ensuring strict adherence to Shariah rules in fund collection and distribution.
Recommendations
To unlock zakat’s potential for socio-economic progress, some policy recommendations are presented that need the attention of policymakers for implementation.
Firstly, the zakat and Ushr Department should prioritise transparency and efficiency by adopting digitalisation, building effective control and audit procedures, ensuring non-political selection processes for zakat committees, and having professional management.
Secondly, the government needs to motivate people to give zakat timely as their religious obligation by creating awareness campaigns with the help of digital and media platforms while promoting transparency in zakat donations.
In terms of NGOs and welfare organisations, regulatory oversights and frameworks need to be developed by regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and other regulatory bodies.
It is crucial to build public trust by ensuring Shariah compliance and transparency in the collection, investment, and utilisation of funds.
Lastly, for donors, it is strongly recommended to verify that the organisation should have separate accounts for zakat and charity, have interest-free investments, and have Shariah-compliant certification and systems for zakat disbursement to the deserving.
These policy measures can improve the trust and confidence of the public about the proper use of their donated funds in terms of zakat and charity. It would also motivate the public at large to contribute wholeheartedly, thus creating much-needed funding to address socio-economic challenges and foster inclusive development in Pakistan.
Furthermore, enhancing zakat collection and spending processes can significantly impact social security programmes like the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP)/ Ehsaas to promote small-scale entrepreneurship.
Zakat holds significant promise in addressing poverty and promoting social development in Pakistan. However, transparency and Shariah compliance issues must be addressed.
Through robust regulatory measures, adherence to Shariah principles, and increased transparency, the government and NGOs can unlock the full potential of Zakat, benefiting both donors and the nation. By harnessing this system’s beauty and strength, we can strengthen our economy and ensure a brighter future for all.

2,100-day agenda for new govt,It will provide trigger for economic growth without any major investments,"It is natural that citizens and voters build up expectations from a new government to deliver them relief. A newly elected government, which will hopefully take the reins soon in Islamabad, will also be under pressure to make such announcements, which can earn them acceptability.
A new government is often expected to announce a 100-day agenda, and in this article, I propose one. The announcements should, in my opinion, be on the one hand meaningful enough to create an impact and should be bold enough to signal a change on the other hand.
There is the usual caveat of pragmatism, especially given the IMF programme, but I also see there is always room for the new government to take such decisions, which are difficult politically. Let me present the 100-day agenda for the new government.
Abolish non-electricity dues
According to the information available at the Ministry of Energy website, electricity consumers pay eight different types of taxes and charges, which include electricity duty, general sales tax, PTV licence fee, finance cost surcharge, extra tax, further tax, income tax and sales tax.
The withholding tax collected is not adjusted because of the lack of an automated mechanism and is appropriated in the case of non-filers of income tax returns. Deduction of sales tax from commercial bills of non-filers gives legitimacy to the non-filers.
Electricity users should be obliged to pay only electricity dues. They do not need any subsidies, however, they must not be penalised for failure of the country’s tax administration.
That is why it is important to remove electricity distribution companies from the clutches of the federal government, while strengthening the institutional regulatory framework. The job of electricity companies is to sell electricity to consumers efficiently and not to collect taxes on behalf of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
Announce tax holiday for small businesses
Despite claims of automation and simplification, the tax policy and tax administration in Pakistan pose a major stumbling block for the registration of new businesses.
Read: Revitalising Constitution: priority agenda for parliament
There is a steady flow of new companies being formed under the SECP, however, a majority of entrepreneurs start informally or as a sole proprietor. We need to encourage them to join the formal economy and help them to become profitable.
The new government should announce income tax holiday for three years for all micro and small businesses registered within 100 days of the new government provided they open a bank account and register with the FBR to file returns.
Open trade with India
Food items constitute the bulk of Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket, particularly for the low-income households, reaching 60% of their average household expenditure.
The new government should resume trade in fruits and vegetables with India, allowing consumers and farmers on both sides to enjoy benefits of continuous supply of eatables at affordable prices.
Allow formal oil trade with Iran
According to official estimates released in 2023, almost 18% of the oil consumed in Pakistan is smuggled from Iran, which is then distributed across the country.
As Pakistan has announced the completion of its side of the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline recently, its calculations show that it is ready to take the risk to avoid $18 billion of penalties, which is three times more than the IMF programme.
In this environment, it will be beneficial for Pakistan’s economy and its government to open formal oil trade links with Iran. This will also bring back Rs60 billion to the exchequer, which is the lost tax revenue.
Announce scholarships for young people
We are wasting billions of rupees each year in the higher education system. We need to divert a major chunk of this budget to technical and vocational education of our qualified young population.
The rate of unemployment is significantly higher among university graduates (about 30%, according to PIDE) as compared with those without university education.
On the other hand, Pakistan’s technical and vocational system continues to fall short of producing the required number of trained workforce to meet the national requirement. A major re-allocation to upgrade this system and the announcement of scholarships for at least 100,000 young people who qualify will be a great boost to the job market.
By announcing this 100-day agenda, the elected government can quickly create a positive environment for the country’s aspiring youth and help provide a trigger for economic growth without any major investments.
The potential for sustainable economic growth lies within our reach if we are ready to take such bold decisions for the welfare of people.

3,Gauging caretaker govt’s economic impact,"Some key members in finance, energy and IT must be retained for their good work","Election fever has receded now as two-family dynasties take control of the new government. What happens to economic policymaking remains to be seen until the announcement of the finance minister, energy/power minister, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s new programme and the budget announcement(s).
The ever-empowered outgoing caretakers did take good care of the economy in arguably the worst economic period in decades. Let’s recap some of the right – not popular – steps taken.
Increase in gas and electricity prices: Subsidising energy costs is clearly out of the equation now. The fiscal space is so constrained that additional wastage is adding to sovereign risks.
Energy companies are on the verge of default and surviving on a day-to-day basis without any ability to expand, let alone transform.
Passing the costs was step one along with much-needed improvement in losses, theft, recovery, energy mix, infrastructure, and molecule availability.
Privatisation: A lot of groundwork has been covered on the privatisation front, especially in the case of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).
With clear focus and resolve to drop the deadweight once and for all, new tribunals and Privatisation Commission rules are being set to expedite pending deals to attract investors and resolve disputes. We need to make headlines by bringing new foreign investors, not just from Arab countries. DISCOs handover: After several rounds of to and fro on whether provinces would take control of the loss-making DISCOs, the cabinet has finally decided to hand over management of these tax-sucking machines to the private sector on a long-term basis.
The proposal of setting up a Performance Management Unit (PMU) to be headed by an army officer didn’t fly and is not a long-term solution either. Only bottom-line-driven, empowered management to hire/fire and incentives-aligned teams can reduce the size of the hole on the balance sheet.
Read: General elections and economy
Adherence to IMF: While being underappreciated, the caretaker government successfully continued to honour its commitment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after a long hiatus coming out of the verge of default. The last IMF review was one of the smoothest in years, paving the way for continued multilateral lending, an increase in reserves, improved sovereign bond yields, rupee stability, and decreased economic uncertainty.
FBR restructuring: Pakistanis remain victims of taxing the taxed, squeezing the middle class, and being mired in corrupt practices. Most of the tax is collected at the import stage and in the form of customs and sales taxes requiring less effort and doesn’t require an army of the workforce. Granted, political interferences prevent collecting fair taxes from traders, landlords, and real estate, but it is hoped the new structure with renewed focus on digitalisation will make real changes instead of tweaking here and there.
Refinery policy and gas sales: After long deliberations, the brownfield and greenfield refinery policy is being finalised to attract $5-6 billion in refinery expansion and probably $10 billion greenfield refinery with Aramco and Sinopec. Long gestation projects require a lot of homework and planning, but government incentives are timely and welcome.
Similarly, the Council of Common Interests (CCI)’s decision to allocate 35% of gas to third parties on commercial terms will help exploration and production (E&P) firms to drill more wells and reduce the burden on imports.
SIFC-led initiatives: The whole of the government approach or the need to combine military and civilian policymakers have come in handy to reduce speculation in the currency market, control theft of electricity and gas, assure foreign bilateral friends of policy continuity, make quick decisions on matters of economic security, and accelerate privatisation as well.
In essence, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) appears to be a governing and approval body for matters pertaining to economic policymaking.
Growing IT sector: Some 3% research and development (R&D) for smartphone assemblers, permitting companies to retain 50% of their export revenues in USD, allocating Rs2 billion for the Pakistan start-up fund, setting up e-Rozgar centres for freelancers, and encouraging Paypal, Stripe, and Starlink to enter Pakistan were key notable positive events under Dr Umar Saif.
To summarise, the caretaker government was the most empowered team of people to make decisions for long-term policymaking. Some of the key members in finance, energy, and IT must be retained for their good work to reach its logical conclusion in one form or the other.
Half a year of economic stability is just the beginning, but much more effort is needed in the next 12 to 24 months to steer the country out of the no-growth trap. Start with hiring competent policymakers.

4,ICT: need for invigoration rather than a chokehold,"Internet blockages, disruptions in IT infrastructure can pose challenges for sector","Uncertainty about the economy has increased post-elections. The volatility in the KSE-100 index of Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) after delay in formation of the new government in the centre and provinces and the slowdown in internet services are likely to further erode business and investor confidence.
Although a coalition setup is likely to govern Pakistan, the first priority must be to steady the economy and reduce political uncertainty. Curtailing the latter is the key to improving economic conditions and regaining the lost business and investor confidence. This will be a momentous challenge for the new government, particularly as it tackles several of them on different fronts.
Exports of information and communication technology (ICT) services have played a crucial role in boosting overall exports of the country in recent years. Unfortunately, internet blockages and disruptions in the IT infrastructure can pose challenges for the sector that can spill over to the entire economy.
In recent years, exports of ICT services from Pakistan have increased significantly. This increase in ICT exports has outperformed the export of goods, with the former increasing 9% year-on-year in the first six months of FY24 compared to 5% growth in the latter.
Exports of computer services have increased by more than 300% in the last seven years, from $530 million in 2016 to $2.1 billion in 2022.
Comparatively, semi-milled rice, which is often hailed as the most important export item, had an export value of $1.7 billion in 2022, according to statistics provided by ITC’s Trademap.org. Exports of rice have decreased from $2.3 billion in 2008.
Furthermore, exports of computer services from Pakistan are now similar to those of Malaysia and Norway, which reported more than three times the exports from Pakistan in 2016.
However, the top exporters of computer services are Ireland and India, reporting values of $204 billion and $96 billion, respectively. This speaks volumes about the potential of the sector.
The freelancing industry is a major contributor to the export of ICT services. According to a recent report of Ignite-National Technology Fund, published in October 2023, Pakistan is the third largest contributor to the global freelance industry, following India and Bangladesh.
Read: Internet watchdog reports nation-scale disruption of social media
Approximately 0.5 million freelancers are present in Pakistan. About 40% of the freelancers are in software development and technology, constituting about 6% of the total freelancers globally in this segment. Many of the countries contributing a significant amount to the freelance industry are English-speaking nations. Freelancers earned an average hourly rate of $28 globally and generated $400 million in Pakistan.
Although freelancing provides opportunities for individuals to earn revenue in dollars and bring much-needed foreign exchange, there are significant challenges associated with freelancing. The lack of infrastructure, disruption in internet services and the need to adapt to the ever-evolving technological developments in the IT sector as well as complementary industries increase the challenges for freelancers.
Also, the freelancing industry is provided with tax incentives from the government to encourage more participation of individuals and widen their scope.
However, as freelancers tend to be easier to hire and less expensive than full-time employees, several established companies consider freelancers as more efficient alternatives to the full-time employees. The incentives provided in terms of tax breaks to the employees make freelancing more lucrative for both the firms and the workers.
Therefore, such arrangements may lead to a higher proportion of freelancers than full-time employees but result in lower tax generation for the government.
This raises red flags as short-term tasks are given precedence by highly skilled workers rather than long-term engagements. Hence, it is imperative to ensure that freelancing is not considered an alternative to full-time employment in the more established IT firms, particularly the firms focusing on projects where the latter can generate long-term benefits and consequently more dollar revenues for the economy.
On the other hand, Bangladesh provides cash rebates on export proceeds, while India provides opportunities to deduct expenditures related to their work from their income. It is crucial to undertake a cost-benefit analysis that determines potential rent-seeking activities just as it is for any industrial policy regardless of the sector.
With that, it is critical to pursue digitalisation of the economy such that it improves the functioning of the government. For example, the Pakistan Single Window helps improve trade-related functions.
Paperless cross-border trade procedures and processes can help reduce the documentation cost and time involved in participating in international trading activities, not only increasing export activities but also improving the productivity of international traders.
The right mix of skilled workers and access to technology can help boost productivity in various sectors of the economy due to the spillover effects of a more innovative ICT sector. Improving the capacity and capabilities of the ICT sector will not only generate greater export revenue for the country but also improve the quality of the government infrastructure and functions.
In essence, the future of the economy depends on the development of the ICT sector as it plays a key role in not only generating dollar revenue but can also increase the vital complementary resources across sectors to improve their productivity levels.
Internet blockages, slowdowns and poor access to the infrastructure reduce the potential of the ICT sector as it increases the challenges for various stakeholders. It is imperative to facilitate the sector by ensuring that all its stakeholders are not only provided with better infrastructure but also uninterrupted services.
