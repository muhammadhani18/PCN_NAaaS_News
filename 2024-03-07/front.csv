0,"PIA privatisation, FBR restructuring greenlit",Sources said the privatisation secretary briefed the premier on the possibility of privatising PIA by June 15,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday approved the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) before June 15 and also endorsed the restructuring plan of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), which had been cleared by the caretakers.
The PML-N’s government on Wednesday carried forward the leftover work of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and the interim setup, marking the continuation of the previous setup’s policies.
Former Finance Minister Ishaq Dar finally joined the PM’s meetings on economic issues after initially avoiding them. Muhammad Aurangzeb, who is being tipped as the Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Finance, also attended the meeting.
Sources said the privatisation secretary briefed the premier on the possibility of privatising PIA by June 15. However, the deadline was subject to the timely implementation of the scheme of arrangement to divide the national flag carrier into two entities and park Rs622 billion debt in the new holding company.
The scheme of arrangement cannot be implemented until the PIA’s creditors give the no-objection-certificates, the PM was informed.
Sources said the prime minister instructed the privatisation secretary to further shorten the period required to sell off the entity.
In 2022, PIA stood as Pakistan’s third-highest public sector loss-making entity, requiring Rs11.5 billion per month solely for servicing its debts.
In a significant development, the prime minister also endorsed the FBR’s restructuring plan, which had previously received approval from the caretaker government but faced halts in its implementation by the court and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
The approved restructuring was contrary to the manifesto of the PML-N that had promised to separate the customs department from the FBR and place it under a ‘to-be-created’ economy ministry.
A day earlier, the premier had directed the hiring of foreign consultants to modernise and digitise the FBR. It was decided on Wednesday that the foreign consultants would work on the entity’s digitisation drive. The prime minister expressed dissatisfaction with the proposal to involve the National Database Registration Authority (Nadra) in the digitisation exercise.
According to the approved plan, the FBR will cease to exist and two new organisations – the Federal Customs Board and Federal Inland Revenue (IR) Board – will be created. In addition, the newly formed bodies will be placed under the Revenue Division.
Former finance minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar had initiated the FBR restructuring exercise. The scope of restructuring was wide-ranging. Its implementation will require amendments to various tax statutes and related laws, enactment of legislation for the two new organisations, and changes in the respective rules as well as the Rules of Business 1973.
Changes would be required in connection with the budget and expenditure allocations for the two organisations, establishment of new administrations, and division of the existing assets between them.
The customs and Inland Revenue organisations will be separated, with each headed by a director general (DG) to be appointed by the federal government from their respective service cadres for a fixed tenure. The two establishments will be the attached departments of the Revenue Division.
The DGs will have administrative, financial and operational autonomy including budgeting as well as posting and transfers for their respective establishments.
All matters related to international taxes; valuation of goods and assets; IT and digitisation, policies in connection with the data exchange between the two DGs, and human resource will also be placed in Revenue Division. Decisions will be made jointly based on consultations with both the DGs.
The determination of value for imported goods through valuation rulings will be carried out by a committee comprising equal representation from customs and IR and placed before the Revenue Division.
Former finance minister Ishaq Dar did not object to the FBR restructuring plan. Aurangzeb commented in the meeting that he was satisfied with the design aspect of the restructuring plan. The prime minister asked to finalise a timeline to implement the restructuring of the organization.
The premier instructed that if necessary, any procurement-related matters should be brought to the SIFC for fast-track implementation of the restructuring. The SIFC has the authority to grant waivers against any rule or law.
Dr Shamshad also attended the meeting. She informed the prime minster that the FBR was losing Rs3.5 trillion in revenue annually, with the majority stemming from sales tax and the income tax.
Additionally, the revenue losses from custom duties amounted to Rs600 billion.Dr Shamshad further stated that about 56 per cent income tax return filers were not paying any income tax, adding that only 200,000 taxpayers were bearing the burden of the 90 per cent tax payment.
The FBR’s tax to GDP ratio was 8.5 per cent, which Dr Shamshad said could reach to 10.8 per cent in the next fiscal year with the implementation of the restructuring plan.
Her assertion was that by improving the compliance alone, the FBR’s revenues could be enhanced by Rs1.7 trillion in the next fiscal year.

1,Ex-SC judge found guilty of misconduct,SJC recommends president to dismiss him from service,"The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa has made history by holding former top court judge Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi guilty of misconduct.
The action came after Naqvi had already tendered his resignation as SC judge after submitting his replies to show-cause notices issued to him by the SJC.
The SJC announced its opinion on the retirement day of one of its members, Ameer Bhatti.
Similarly, another member, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, retires on Friday (today). Balochistan High Court CJ Naeem Akhtar Afghan will be elevated to the SC.
In view of the SJC holding Naqvi guilty of misconduct and recommending his removal, he will no longer be entitled to receive pension and other benefits. Several lawyers believe that the opinion on Naqvi is the result of coordinated efforts by the executive, bar, and SJC.
When Naqvi resigned, the SJC wanted to continue its proceedings against him.
However, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan pointed out in a SC judgment given last year wherein it was held that the council could not proceed against a resigned or retired judge.
He informed the SJC that the government would move an intra-court appeal (ICA) against the judgment.
The matter was immediately scheduled before a larger bench, which held that the SJC proceedings could not be stopped even after the resignation of a respondent judge. One section of lawyers has serious reservations over this interpretation.
Naqvi was facing misconduct proceedings for the second time.
Complaints of misconduct against Naqvi were filed after he suggested taking suo motu notice over the delay in holding of the general elections for Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa assemblies.
Unlike in the past, Naqvi's relationship remained tense with the ‘powerful circles' after this suo motu notice. He was also aligned with ex-CJP Umar Ata Bandial's group. An element of judicial politics cannot be ruled out.
It is also a fact that the allegations against Naqvi were also strong. Instead of responding to them, he preferred to resign at the eleventh hour.
Advocate Abdul Moiz Jaferii believed that the method through which Naqvi was investigated and the way the evidence against him came to light left much to be desired.
However, he added that it was clear that there were multiple incidents of gross misconduct on the former judge’s part. He pointed out that they included Naqvi’s unexplained property dealings, money transfers to his children by real estate brokers or contacts with political party leaders whose interests he was adjudicating.
“Naqvi should have been ousted for suspending the [former military ruler Pervez] Musharraf verdict, for ignoring jurisdiction when it came to the airtime ban on [MQM founder] Altaf Hussain, for doing whatever the establishment wanted and being promoted to the SC in the process,” he added.
""Instead, he was punished after falling foul of forces he was aligned with in the past, for mistaking his own authority, as well as for wrongly siding with and then relying on the support of [ex-CJP] Bandial.""
Jaferii further said it was right to declare the former judge guilty, but the timing was wrong.
“The court has dismissed an agent from within itself. It has drawn a red line. Let’s see how many others are across it.""
A statement issued by the SJC, which met on February 29 and March 1 this year, read that the allegations levelled against SC and high court judges were publicised.
“A number of judges have expressed concern that if they respond to such allegations the same may be construed as misconduct because the Code of Conduct, dated 2 September 2009 issued by the Supreme Judicial Council, in its Article-V states that a judge should not seek publicity. The Supreme Judicial Council deliberated upon the matter and was of the opinion that if a reply or clarification is issued by or on behalf of a judge if it does not violate Article-V. However, since concerns have been expressed by judges, it was agreed that the following be added to Article-V of the Code of Conduct: ‘If an allegation is publicised against a judge he may respond to it.’ Therefore, Article -V of the Code of Conduct was amended to read as under: ‘Functioning as he does in full view of the public, a judge gets thereby all the publicity that is good for him. He should not seek more. In particular, he should not engage in any public controversy, least of all on a political question, notwithstanding that it involves a question of law. However, if an allegation is publicised against a judge he may respond to it.”
The SJC rendered its opinion in respect of the nine complaints against Naqvi under Article 209(6) of the Constitution. The council was of the opinion that he was guilty of misconduct and should have been removed from the office of judge.
Advocate Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar said this was the first time in the judicial history of the country when a judge of the SC, even though he had resigned, the SJC continued its proceedings against him under Article 209 of the Constitution and recommended to president for his removal on ground of misconduct which would deprive him from pension and other benefits.
Khokhar continued that Naqvi would also be considered to be a judge removed from the SC.
He said that the present findings of the SJC against their one of their fellows would set a new line of action for the judges who would be found facing complaints of misconduct and definitely improve the transparency as well as internal accountability standards in the superior judiciary.
“If a matter of misconduct will be started, it will reach its ultimate conclusion on either side.”Khokhar further said now it was important for the SJC to decide all pending applications as per its rules of misconduct filed against the superior court judges and rule on them at the earliest as that would definitely help in uplifting the dignity of the country’s judiciary.

2,Shehbaz matches Modi’s terse greeting,"‘Good relations’ with all its neighbours including India, says PM Shehbaz Sharif to his Indian counterpart Modi"," 
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday thanked his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for congratulating him on his election victory as the foreign office said Pakistan always wanted ‘good relations’ with all its neighbours including India.
Shehbaz responded to Modi’s felicitation message on X, formerly Twitter, two days after the Indian prime minister posted a terse message.
There were consultations among the decision makers about the response of the newly-elected prime minister to Modi’s greetings given the fact that the Indian premier’s statement was very brief.
Unlike the past, Modi did not use the words such as His Excellency nor did he make any mention of a desire seeking peace with Pakistan. He also avoided a reference to terrorism, something his past statements always did.
Sources said Prime Minister Shehbaz was advised to respond the same way as Modi greeted him. That was the reason that Shehbaz’s message was also terse. “Thank you @narendaramodi for felicitations on my election as the Prime Minister of Pakistan,” he wrote on X.
“Modi’s terse congratulatory post to Sharif and Sharif’s equally terse response tell us all we need to know about the present state of India-Pakistan relations and what each leader thinks of the relationship these days,” commented Michael Kugelman, an expert on South Asia.
Meanwhile, speaking at the weekly briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said Pakistan always would like to have good relations with all its neighbours, including India.
“However, these relations must be based on respect and equality. It is also important that issues of concern to Pakistan, including the support for terrorism, and extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings by India in Pakistan. Kashmir will always be a priority when such engagement takes place,” she added.
About the exchange of messages between Modi and Shehbaz, the spokesperson said the foreign office was waiting for the new government to give directions regarding its foreign policy priorities including ties with India.
“As you know, the Cabinet formation is yet to take place and once the Cabinet is in place, we will have a direction with regard to the foreign policy and Pakistan's relations with other countries, including its neighbours. We would then be in a better position to respond to queries on how this will impact Pakistan's interaction with India in coming days,” she said.
Thank you @narendramodi for felicitations on my election as the Prime Minister of Pakistan 🇵🇰
Moreover, Prime Minister Shehbaz received a briefing from the outgoing caretaker Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani and Foreign Secretary Syrus Qazi on major foreign policy challenges.
Shehbaz was joined by Ishaq Dar, triggering speculations that the veteran PML-N leader may be this time appointed as the country’s foreign minister. Sources in the foreign office said they were getting the same signals but waiting for the final announcement.
Meanwhile, commenting on the visit of Indian Prime Minister Modi to the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region, the spokesperson said this seems part of India’s effort to portray “normalcy” in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).
“We believe that these efforts to project normalcy are a facade and tourism cannot be promoted in a situation where local people are being intimidated and their rights and freedoms are being denied,” she said.
Modi undertook the visit to the restive region for the first time since his government unilaterally revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019. His visit came just weeks before the parliamentary elections in India.

3,Stay on NA reserved seats extended till 13th,PHC summons AGP on next date of hearing,"The Peshawar High Court on Thursday extended its stay order on the oath-taking by members of the National Assembly allotted reserved seats till March 13 on a plea filed by the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), while PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar said his party would challenge before the top court the “tampering” with Forms-45 issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
A five-member larger bench of the PHC, headed by Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, heard the petition filed by the SIC – a little known party in which the PTI independent members found refuge – against the ECP’s decision to turn down its request for its share of reserved seats for women and minorities.
The other judges on the bench included Justices Ijaz Anwar, SM Attique Shah, Shakeel Ahmed and Syed Arshad Ali.
A day earlier, a two-member bench of the PHC restrained the reserved seats MNAs from taking oath for a day and referred the case to the high court’s chief justice for the formation of a larger bench.
On Thursday, PTI lawyer Babar Awan informed the larger bench about the presidential elections scheduled for March 9 and argued that a party with 93 seats in the NA was not being allocated its due share of reserved seats.
He added that other parties with just a seat each in the lower house had been allotted two reserved seats.
Awan claimed that the ECP had “gifted” the reserved seats to other parties.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Additional Attorney General Sanaullah sought time for the preparation of arguments in the case.

He informed the court that Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan was busy with another case being heard in the SC and that was why he could not appear before the court.
Justice Ibrahim recalled that the PHC had summoned the AGP. To this, PTI lawyer Qazi Anwar replied that a new AGP would be appointed on Friday (today) and they would then appear before the PHC.
The court summoned the AGP on the next date of hearing and extended the stay on the petition till March 13, when it would be resumed.
In a related development, SIC Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza filed a petition before the Lahore High Court challenging the ECP’s decision to not allot the reserved seats in the Punjab Assembly to his party.
In his plea, the SIC chief contended that his party should be allotted its share of the reserved seats in the provincial assembly as the ECP was neither a tribunal, nor a court. He added that it did not matter if the SIC contested the polls or not.
The SIC chairman argued that the action of the ECP was equivalent to amending the Constitution.
Maintaining that the commission had exceeded its jurisdiction, he asked the court to declare Section 104, Rule 94 of the Election Act as “unconstitutional”.
Separately, while interacting with the media outside the Islamabad High Court, PTI’s Zafar in response to query said his party would challenge the matter of Forms-45 before the SC.
On the issue of reserved seats not being allotted to the SIC, Zafar said the matter was sub judice as it being heard in the PHC and its decision would be valid for the NA and provincial legislatures.
Zafar further said the PTI would challenge the issue of the reserved seats in the Punjab Assembly before the LHC on Friday and the party’s legal team had prepared the draft of the petition for this purpose.
The PTI leader disclosed that party leader Sher Afzal Marwat would become a member of the Public Accounts Committee.
He continued that Marwat had been nominated for this post by PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan.
