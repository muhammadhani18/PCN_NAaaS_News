0,Adiala Jail official faces contempt,Court demands answer from jail superintendent over his failure to produce Imran," 
A district court on Wednesday issued a notice of contempt of court to the superintendent of Adiala Jail for his failure to produce Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founding chairman Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, in their bail applications.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over the bail pleas of Imran Khan in six cases and Bushra Bibi in one case. Advocates representing PTI, including Sardar Bharji Khan and Amina Ali Advocate, appeared before the court.
Expressing dissatisfaction with the absence of the accused, Judge Sipra issued a contempt of court notice to the superintendent of Adiala Jail and demanded an explanation as to why contempt of court action should not be initiated against him.
The judge instructed the police officers present in the courtroom to communicate with the jail authorities and urged them to ensure the online presence of the former prime minister and his wife.
During the proceedings, Sardar Masroof Khan Advocate, representing the accused, sought the court's understanding to mark attendance, with arguments to be presented at the next hearing.
However, the judge said that if attendance was marked, arguments would also need to be heard immediately.
In response, the lawyer explained that Barrister Salman Safdar, a key figure in the case, could not attend, citing a scheduled hearing at Adiala Jail on May 9.
Despite this, the judge insisted on marking the attendance of the accused through a video link, preceding any arguments.
The court adjourned the hearing until the accused could be present through video link.
Upon resumption of the hearing, the accused's presence was not established through video link, prompting the court to express indignation and issue the contempt of court notice to the superintendent of Adiala Jail.
The court mandated that the superintendent submit a response on the next hearing, addressing why contempt of court action should not be taken against him.
The case will resume on March 11, with the court sternly stressing the necessity for adherence to its instructions, as underscored in the previous hearing where video link attendance was ordered for PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi.

1,Fazl rejects supremacy of ‘one institution’,Says their mandate was rigged not by political parties but by establishment,"Toughening his stance against the establishment, the chief of his eponymous faction of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Thursday refused to “acknowledge supremacy of one institution”. Issuing a stern warning, he urged those in power to “stay within their limits”, while also alleging widespread coercion of voters to support “preferred candidates” nationwide.
“We cannot build a nation through oppression. Let us remain a nation grounded in ethics and intellect. Establishment should listen that this is the voice of Fazlur Rehman and of his party,” he said while addressing the JUI-F Punjab General Council in Lahore.
The JUI-F chief, who faced defeat in the Feb 8 elections in his home district, had been accusing the powerful quarters of rigging the ballot and forming a government of their choice.

He decided to abstain from participating in the parliamentary elections and sit on the opposition benches.

The JUI-F chief emphasised their adherence to the concept of democracy defined by senior religious scholars and questioned the deviation from democratic norms.
""Parliament is being brought into existence according to western interests. Do not expect anything from the rulers. They have buried their dignity before their demise,"" he remarked.
Fazl questioned the credibility of the United States in advocating the human rights after its actions in Afghanistan and Palestine.
""Our manifesto states that we become the voice of the oppressed. I told Shehbaz Sharif, join the opposition, lest you become a target of our movement,"" he added.
The JUI-F chief warned that they could not only “create trouble” in the parliament but also outside the House.
He concluded by saying that their mandate was not rigged by political parties but by the establishment.

Without naming anyone, the JUI-F leader stated they would not “accept supremacy of one institution” while cautioning those in power to “stay within their boundaries”.
Fazl said people in villages and rural areas were frequently forced to vote for certain candidates against their will. ""Our party is often told to withdraw our candidate for someone, money is also demanded from our candidates. If we present evidence, there will be no refuge for you,” he said.
Expressing apprehension about the state of democracy, the JUI-F leader remarked, ""Regrettably, I see this country heading towards the situation in Bengal. Parliament is merely a symbolic institution, and democracy is losing its ground"".
Challenging those who label their struggle against democracy, he asserted, ""We are fighting against those who declare democracy as infidelity, but we are being cornered. If parliament continues to be formed through rigging, it will lose its significance"".

3,Outgoing senators express parting wishes,"Senators call for strengthening democracy, restoring trade ties with neighbours and ending perks of parliamentarians","A multitude of lofty and ambitious proposals resonated through the upper house on Wednesday, ranging from the enhancement of trade relations with neighbouring nations to the recommendation to put an end to caretaker governments, as the outgoing lawmakers bid farewell.
The farewell meeting of outgoing senators served as the platform for the parting reflections on the future of the country.
Among the various wishes was a bold declaration to cease the issuance of free plane tickets to parliamentarians and put an end to perks such as complimentary electricity and petrol, while one senator envisioned a hypothetical day as prime minister to fix the country's woes.
The Senate gathering met under the chairmanship of Deputy Chairman Mirza Afridi.
Commencing with the recitation of the Holy Quran, the session proceeded with the presentation of the Standing Committee on Law and Justice's report on the amendment bill for the Service Tribunal Act, 1973.
Additionally, the standing committee's report addressing the challenges faced by overseas Pakistanis also took centre stage during the meeting.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, addressing the assembly after the reports, urged the upper house to play a pivotal role in opening borders for trade, particularly with neighbouring countries like Afghanistan and Iran.
In a pointed address during a point of order, Senator Syed revealed that a delegation from Afghanistan had arrived in Pakistan, seeking the opening of borders for trade.
Highlighting the economic impact, he stated, ""The trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan is around 5 billion US dollars, but due to the closure of borders, entire business activity is closed, causing difficulties for Afghan traders.""
Senator Syed emphasised the potential for landlocked countries, including Afghanistan and Tajikistan, to benefit from trade opportunities via Gwadar.
Expressing concern over Pakistan's current relations with neighbouring countries, he called for continued hospitality, stating, ""Pakistan has been a host country for all its neighbouring countries for 40 years, and the same role must continue in the future for prosperity and peace in the region.""
Senator Syed urged the chairman and deputy chairman of the Senate to facilitate a meeting of Afghan traders and elevate the issue to the highest levels for the opening of borders.
Meanwhile, other senators stressed strengthening democracy for the country’s prosperous future.
Deputy Chairman of the Senate, Mirza Muhammad Afridi, acknowledged the resolution presented by Senator Ishaq Dar, the leader of the house, and Senator Dr Shahzad Waseem, the leader of the opposition.
The resolution, filed under Rule 263 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, sought the exemption from Rule 41 of the mentioned Rules concerning the question hour for the remaining sittings of the ongoing session.
Senator Professor Dr Mahar Taj Roghani in her farewell speech appreciated the Chairman Senate Sadiq Sanjrani and Deputy Chairman Senate Mirza Afridi for the smooth conduct of senate sessions.
She suggested that the oath of the senators should not be mandatory for senators because they don’t justify it with their acts when coming into power.
Senator Mahar Taj said that she did her best in her tenure as a senator but still feels depressed for not contributing enough to the development of the country.
She also suggested that the bills passed by the Senate should not be sent to the National Assembly for further approval because the Senate has the status of upper house, however, the bills passed by the National Assembly must come to the Senate for approval.
Senator Moula Bux Chandio in his farewell speech said that Pakistan has to be run by politicians therefore politicians must believe in dialogue and talk to each other in the country’s best interest.
He said the 18th amendment is an amendment for the survival of Pakistan and the Pakistan Peoples Party will not tolerate any conspiracy to end this amendment.
Moula Bux Chandio said politicians and political parties must learn from their mistakes and further strengthen democracy by forgetting past mistakes.
He said that democracy will be matured if it is not derailed and would be strengthened after mistakes.
Chandio also thanked his party leadership for nominating him for senatorship.

4,ECP uploaded ‘tampered’ Forms-45s on website: PTI,"Forms-45s were altered, due to overwhelming number of votes in favour of PTI, says Taimur Jhagra","PTI leader Taimur Jhagra on Wednesday accused the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of tampering with Forms-45s in numerous constituencies in the wake of the ‘controversial’ February 8 general elections.
Addressing the media outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, Jhagra, accompanied by PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and party leader Barrister Salman Akram Raja, claimed that the ECP initially released Forms-45 for several constituencies but later withdrew them from their website.
According to Jhagra, all Forms-45s were forcibly altered, purportedly due to the overwhelming number of votes in favour of PTI.
He argued that this manipulation rendered it virtually impossible for opponents to secure victory without resorting to tampering.
Furthermore, Jhagra asserted that the ECP subsequently uploaded these tampered Forms-45s on their website, suggesting potential electoral malpractice.
Highlighting irregularities across Balochistan, Sindh, and other provinces, Jhagra pointed out instances where numbers were allegedly changed through dubious means.
He raised concerns about the legitimacy of certain polling stations, where the number of votes reportedly exceeded the actual number of voters present.
Additionally, he criticised the inadequate documentation of some Forms-45s.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, echoing Jhagra's sentiments, declared their intention to approach the high courts in Sindh and Peshawar regarding reserved seats. He expressed confidence in the judiciary's ability to adjudicate impartially in accordance with the Constitution and the law.
Reaffirming PTI's position, Barrister Gohar maintained that they had secured victory in 180 seats in the National Assembly and had provided all necessary evidence to support their claim.
It is pertinent to note that widespread criticism had ensued due to the delayed release of the forms, raising concerns about the transparency and fairness of the electoral process.

5,Nawaz sons' arrest warrants temporarily lifted,Hassan Nawaz and Hussain Nawaz to return to Pakistan on March 12," A trial court suspended the permanent arrest warrants issued for Hassan and Hussain, the sons of former prime minister and PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, until March 14.
Islamabad Accountability Court-I Judge Nasir Javed Rana issued this order on Thursday while hearing petitions filed by the brothers through Advocate Qazi Misbah.
Hassan and Hussain were named as accused along with Nawaz Sharif, his daughter Maryam, and son-in-law Captain (retd) Safdar in the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) Avenfield case reference.
The accountability court had ordered Hassan and Hussain to appear in court multiple times during the trial. Later, it declared them proclaimed offenders and issued their permanent arrest warrants due to their non-appearance.
The court convicted Nawaz, Maryam, and Safdar in July 2017. Interestingly, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) later acquitted them in the case.

Advocate Misbah argued during the hearing that while permanent arrest warrants for Hassan and Hussain were still in effect, the other accused in the case had been acquitted.
“Hassan Nawaz and Hussain Nawaz want to return to Pakistan on March 12 and appear in court. The execution of the permanent warrants should be delayed,” he stated.
NAB prosecutor Sohail Arif contended that according to the law, arrest warrants are suspended only when the accused appears in court, emphasizing that such warrants cannot be suspended without appearance.
“The purpose of the warrant is to bring the accused to court. However, if Hassan Nawaz and Hussain Nawaz want to appear in court, they should be given the opportunity,” he added. The accountability court then decided to suspend the permanent warrants for Hassan and Hussain until March 14.

6,Understanding the presidential election process,"Senators, MNAs, and MPs gear up to cast votes","As the nation gears up to elect its next president, senators, MNAs, and MPs from all four provinces are set to cast their votes in an electoral process where elected representatives become the voters.
Different from the general elections, where the public directly votes for the president or prime minister, the country’s parliamentary system relies on elected representatives.
The electoral college for the presidential election comprises members of parliament and provincial assemblies.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), responsible for overseeing the voting process, has designated the National Assembly Hall as the polling station.
The chief justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) will serve as the presiding officer, overseeing the election in the parliament within the National Assembly. Similarly, the chief justices of the Sindh, Balochistan, and Punjab high courts will preside over the polling processes in their respective assemblies.
However, in Punjab, due to the retirement of the chief justice of the Lahore High Court (LHC), a member of the ECP has been appointed as the presiding officer.
Voting and counting will take place in the four provinces, with Form 5 prepared in the presence of polling agents for the presidential candidates.
Form 5, akin to Form 45 in general elections, will be signed by the polling agents and presiding officers. Subsequently, the presiding officers will dispatch Form 5 and votes to the returning officer, who, in this election, is the chief election commissioner, with final decisions resting on their shoulders.
Following the March 9 polling, the returning officer, i.e., the chief election commissioner, will issue Form 7 after consolidation with the presidential candidates, declaring it as the final and official result.
The counting of votes in the presidential election follows a unique formula distinct from general elections. While each citizen's vote is considered as one vote in general elections, the presidential election uses a separate formula to ensure the equal representation of all units.

7,Punjab Assembly likely to meet on March 8,Only members of assembly who have taken oath will be authorised to cast their votes in presidential polls,"Punjab Assembly session is likely to be called on March 8 for the oath taking of the members elected on reserved seats.
After rejecting the request of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) for reserved seats, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had started the process of allotting them to other parliamentary parties, issuing a notification in this regard.
The members of the PML-N, PPP and other parties elected on reserved seats will be sworn in during the provincial assembly session.
The Punjab Assembly meeting will be called a day before the presidential election after the notification by the election supervisor, assembly sources maintained.
According to sources, only members of the assembly who have taken oath will be authorised to cast their votes in the presidential elections.
Punjab Assembly speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan will administer the oath to 21 members elected on reserved seats.
On Monday, the ECP’s last year’s decision to strip the PTI of its election symbol came back to haunt the former ruling party once again.
The polls oversight authority refused to allocate reserved seats to the SIC – which comprises PTI backed lawmakers – just because it had not submitted a “priority list” for them prior to polls.

8,OIC voices concern over India’s Kashmir abuses,Urges probe of war crimes against Palestinians,"Pakistan, speaking for the Islamic countries, has underscored the need for investigating Israeli war crimes against the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank to pave the way for accountability.
“It is high time that violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law including war crimes committed against the Palestinian people are investigated and accountability follows,” Ambassador Bilal Ahmad, permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN offices in Geneva, told the Human Rights Council during its general debate on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Pakistani envoy, who was speaking on behalf of the OIC countries, voiced “deep anguish” over the deteriorating human rights situation in Indian occupied Kashmir.
“We urge India to comply with the applicable UN Security Council resolutions and implement recommendations addressed to it in the two Kashmir reports by OHCHR, the UN human rights office, which need to be updated,” the OIC statement said.
“The Council must pay attention to consistent observations made by SPMHs (Special Procedure Mandate Holders) on the human rights violations, impunity and draconian laws in the occupied territory.”
In the statement, Ambassador Ahmad strongly condemned all crimes committed by the Israeli Occupation Forces in Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), and called for implementing provisional measures issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and reminded all states of their responsibilities in this regard.
“We reiterate our longstanding call for upholding respect for human rights and international humanitarian law in the OPT, including in East Jerusalem,” he said.
“We also call for reversal of all measures aimed at institutionalizing illegal occupation, apartheid and colonial settlement enterprise in OPT.”
The OIC also called on the Council to work towards securing justice and accountability for the Rohingya people, including through their safe, dignified, and voluntary return to their homes in Myanmar. The OIC, he said, reiterated its full solidarity with Bangladesh and supports calls for assistance to the country in efforts to achieve a durable solution.
“The OIC condemns the damage and loss of properties inflicted by Armenia including cultural heritage and religious sites in the territories of Azerbaijan liberated from the occupation,” the statement said.
“The OIC reaffirms its full support to the Government and people of Azerbaijan and call upon the international community to extend assistance to Azerbaijan for the safe and dignified return of Azerbaijani IDPs (internally displaced persons).
“We strongly condemn the acts of religious hatred manifested in the repeated acts of desecration of the Holy Quran,” Ambassador Ahmad said, while underlining the need for enacting legal measures by states to tackle this menace.

9,SC questions public display of assault rifles,Expresses displeasure over exemptions for prohibited bore arms,"The apex court on Wednesday rejected an Interior Ministry report on the issuance of arms licenses of prohibited bore to certain categories of people.
The court observed that the public display of assault rifles by private guards, as is found in Pakistan, is unthinkable in the rest of the world.
A three-member bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice (CJ) Qazi Faez and comprising Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Mussarat Hilali, resumed hearing a petition filed against this practice.
During the proceedings, the CJ asked when the law prohibits firearms of certain types, how the authorities can make exceptions in the rules.
""People roam around carrying Kalashnikovs, and innocent individuals are regularly killed like animals. When we go to schools, we find security guards carrying lethal weapons, but outside schools for poor children, there are no guards. How will we know if a person carrying a weapon is a terrorist or not?"" he asked.
The judge regretted that even judges have been included in the category permitted to carry prohibited weapon licenses.
""For me, it is shameful to receive special treatment in the law,"" he said, adding that his name was put on the list of people who could carry arms of prohibited bore without his permission. ""I wrote a letter regarding this matter but did not receive a response.""
Justice Isa asked the interior secretary to give an example of another country in the world where people travel in double-cabin vehicles accompanied by private guards carrying Kalashnikovs.
""We have made a joke of Pakistan. Wherever you go, you find people openly displaying firearms.
Parliament and provincial assemblies make laws, and the judiciary implements them, but some people have been exempted from the law.""
The court raised questions even about the procedure for verifying firearm licenses. The CJ said licenses for prohibited bore weapons are issued by the federal government. How can a police officer in Gwadar verify whether the license being shown to him is genuine or fake? He asked.
The interior secretary informed the court that the relevant rules are being reviewed. He said permission is granted to a select few individuals under certain conditions to possess prohibited weapons for self-defense against imminent threats.
Justice Isa remarked that this weapon can be used not just for defense but also for offense. The interior secretary's duty is to ensure the safety of the people of Pakistan, he said.
Upon inquiry by the court, the interior secretary revealed that both the secretary and the Minister of Interior have the authority to issue such licenses.
The chief justice stated that this is not a public but an administrative matter. The minister should have no role in issuing such licenses. He lamented that the civil bureaucracy could not handle pressure, and officers are not taking a stand on crucial matters.
It was revealed in response to the court's inquiry that according to data from 2010, 117,000 licenses for prohibited bore weapons have been issued. Upon mentioning another figure of 140,000 at another place, the CI remarked that there is inconsistency in the ministry's figures.
The ministry told the bench that judges, the president, the prime minister, chief ministers, Senate chairman, speaker of legislatures, and officers ranging from grade-19 to grade-22 are eligible for such licenses. The chief justice questioned why this differentiation exists.
""If licenses are to be issued, then they should be given to everyone. Why this discrimination? Why have certain classes been exempted from the law?"" he added.
The court also raised questions on the issued Statutory Regulatory Order (SRO) regarding prohibited weapons. Justice Mazhar told the interior secretary that the SRO referred to had not been properly notified in the official gazette.
The court adjourned further proceedings and summoned the Attorney-General for Pakistan. The bench noted that it would also issue a written order of the court proceedings.
