1,Gandapur absent from PM’s Peshawar visit,Observers fear that this growing discord between the province and the Centre will lead to future complications,"Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s absence from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s official functions during the PM’s visit to Peshawar on Wednesday signals a growing rift between the two parties, which bodes ill for the province. Gandapur had previously stayed away from the prime minister’s oath-taking ceremony as well.
During Shehbaz Sharif’s day-long official visit to Peshawar, where he was received by Governor Haji Ghulam Ali, Gandapur chose to remain absent from the events. This included Shehbaz Sharif’s meeting to assess the damage caused by torrential downpour across the province and the subsequent distribution of relief funds to affected families. Notably, the K-P province was represented by Governor Ghulam Ali, Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) Provincial President Amir Muqam, and PML-N General Secretary Murtaz Javed Abassi.
Observers fear that this growing discord between the province and the Centre will lead to future complications, ultimately impacting the general public. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in his interactions with rain and flood-affected individuals in Peshawar, emphasized the importance of robust planning and institutional structures to address natural disasters.
Highlighting Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate change, Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged the recent devastating floods and torrential rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which resulted in numerous casualties. He commended the efforts of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, chief secretary, district administrations, and all others involved in the rescue and rehabilitation operations. The prime minister assured that compensation had been distributed to the injured and the families of the deceased.
Gandapur’s absence from PM Shehbaz’s Peshawar visit underscores the widening gulf between provincial and federal powers. The standoff, evident in Gandapur’s deliberate aloofness, hints at deeper political tensions. Such discord risks hampering governance and exacerbating public woes, highlighting the urgent need for reconciliation and collaboration.

2,"Bugti warns truant doctors, teachers","Stressed the imperative of decentralizing public interest departments such as education, health, and social welfare","Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Ahmed Bugti has stressed the absolute necessity for the presence of teachers in schools and medical personnel in hospitals, ensuring there will be no compromises on this essential matter.
“There will be Zero tolerance for absentee teachers and doctors,” the CM announced. Recognizing the evolving demands of the modern era, Bugti has underscored the importance of integrating skills development programs alongside conventional education within educational institutions. He has also emphasized the significance of professional development and training programs to boost workforce efficiency within government departments.
During a meeting attended by key officials including Additional Chief Secretary Abdul Saboor Kakar and Secretaries Lal Jan Jafar and Babar Khan, Bugti highlighted the crucial need to maintain a balance between resources and development planning. He emphasized the formulation of annual development programs within available financial resources, aiming to minimize deficits and gradually reduce dependence on the federal government.

3,Rs5b cash injection to restore Sehat card,K-P govt to pay Rs3b monthly installment to health insurer to sustain scheme,"The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) government has taken a significant step towards restoring healthcare services for its citizens by committing to release Rs5 billion to the State Life Insurance Company. This decision comes in response to a pressing need to reinstate treatments covered under the Sehat Insaf Card program, a vital healthcare initiative in the province.
Official sources told The Express Tribune that the K-P government currently owes the insurance company a staggering Rs17 billion, accumulated over time due to ongoing financial obligations. 
To address this outstanding debt and revive the Sehat Insaf Card scheme, the government has devised a plan to disburse the owed amount in phases. 
Initially, Rs5 billion will be allocated, with subsequent instalments of Rs3 billion scheduled for monthly payments until the entire debt is settled.
The restoration of healthcare services under the Sehat Insaf Card program is another critical aspect of the government’s relief efforts. The decision to resume coverage from 1st Ramazan signifies a significant milestone in addressing the healthcare needs of the population. 
However, initial reinstatement will cover only 85% of healthcare services, with certain procedures, such as kidney and liver transplants, subject to approval by the provincial cabinet. 
This cautious approach reflects the government’s commitment to ensuring responsible and sustainable healthcare provision while navigating financial constraints.
This decision overturns the caretaker government’s scaled-down provision, which limited coverage to cancer and kidney dialysis treatments, slashing monthly expenses from Rs3 billion to Rs300 million. 
Approximately 10.2 million families stand to benefit from this reinstatement, with 119 hospitals, including 60 public sector and medical teaching institute (MTI) hospitals, set to resume Sehat Card services. 
Official sources told The Express Tribune that, due to a shortage of funds, these public sector hospitals were finding it hard to even purchase medicines and provide free treatment to patients.
A formal letter had been sent to the chief of the Social Health Protection Initiative by the insurance company in which the company had taken the stance that dues under the Sehat Card had touched the Rs30 billion mark and the claims would only be paid if the provincial government released funds to the insurance company, said an official, adding that the insurance company had demanded that the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government release at least Rs10 billion in funds so that MTI hospitals could be paid their claims.
An official of the health department told The Express Tribune that due to the non-payment of Rs2 billion in claims by the insurance company, Lady Reading Hospital (LRH) had been forced to arrange medicines through local purchase.
“The largest health facility of this province, LRH, has to pay a local pharmacy millions of rupees and the pharmacy has now stopped the provision of medicines to the hospital,” he noted, adding that LRH lacked funds even to pay its employees.
“Consultants at LRH who treat patients under the Sehat Card have been without medicines and other items and their share has also been stopped a long time ago, forcing many consultants to leave the hospital,” he disclosed.
The government’s intervention aims to alleviate these financial pressures and ensure uninterrupted healthcare access for the people of K-P.
Overall, the government’s action to address both immediate relief needs and long-term healthcare provision reflects a commitment to the well-being of its citizens. 
By prioritizing timely compensation for disaster victims and reinstating vital healthcare services, the government aims to mitigate the impact of recent challenges and foster resilience in affected communities. Moving forward, sustained efforts will be needed to address underlying vulnerabilities and build a more robust healthcare system that can withstand future crises.
