0,Chinese PV goes global: sail against the current but follow the trend,Beijing’s PV production capacity growth expected to remain in double-digit range this year,"“In 2023, China’s photovoltaic (PV) application market has indeed achieved unexpected development, reaching 216.88GW (gigawatts), a staggering year-on-year growth of 148.1%, exceeding the predictions of all industry insiders.
With the growing demand for green electricity, we predict that the domestic new installed capacity will remain at a high level this year,” Liu Yiyang, Deputy Secretary General of China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA), forecast.
“We should follow this general trend, seize the opportunities, and intensify efforts to promote high-quality development of new energy in China,” in accordance with what President Xi stressed during a recent group study session on new energy technology and China’s energy security, a series of key points related to new energy including photovoltaics could be traced in the 2024 Government Work Report released on March 5.
“Lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets.” Upholding the idea of President Xi, China’s sustainable development has ushered in a new era.
The Work Report pointed out that last year China’s exports of the “New Three”, namely electric vehicles, lithium batteries, and photovoltaic products, have increased by nearly 30%.
In the new year, controlling fossil energy consumption, strengthening the construction of large-scale wind power and photovoltaic bases, promoting the development and utilisation of distributed energy, and developing new energy storage, such “new quality productive forces” are still indispensable parts of the Government Work Report.
“According to CPIA statistics, China’s PV production capacity growth rate will still remain in a double-digit range in 2024, apparently due to our products being supplied to the whole world. Therefore, new global PV installed capacity this year will still show a positive growth trend.”
Liu told the reporter that past year, China’s PV industry exports have shown an increase in volume but a decrease in price, mainly due to the large drop in PV prices, which has led to a slight decline in export value.
Whereas, the growth in export volume is still speedy, the concentration of the top 10 exporting countries has declined.
“In the future, emerging markets such as Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan should be the next oasis for domestic companies, because these countries are rich in light resources, as well as many of which are plagued by high electricity prices. It’s reasonable that there is great potential for us to cooperate with these countries to further develop the PV industry.”
“Taking Pakistan as an example,” Liu analysed, “the Chinese development model of source-grid-load-storage integration could be copied here. In the initial stage, the distributed, independent renewable energy storage systems will solve the daily power consumption problems that plague residents. As the scale expands, it will even solve the power consumption problem of some small-scale industrial parks. In the long run, as such system would be connected to some local national power grids and supplemented to some extent, it may be able to solve the problem of large-scale industrial power consumption.”
“As a consequence, Belt and Road countries and developing countries, including Pakistan, have rigid demand for our PV and energy storage products. However, the current power generation cost of these products is just slightly lower than the price of local traditional energy, thus they are relatively less attractive. As we continue to reduce costs as well as increase efficiency, PV products would become increasingly tempting. Today, Pakistan is making every effort to develop its transportation and infrastructure, striving to build itself into a transportation hub in South Asia and even Asia. With local logistics and transportation being constantly optimised and integrated with the superior lighting resources, I am full of confidence in markets such as Pakistan.”
Li Zhenguo, Founder of LONGi Green Energy, has echoed more specific ideas. “LONGi has developed PV management solutions including but not limited to agricultural PV, forest PV, animal husbandry PV and fishery PV, hoping to provide new models for countries in need. With the gradual decline of costs and increasing maturity of energy storage technology, PV will assume the responsibility of repairing the earth. So far, emerging markets have continued to expand every year, providing a broader market space for China’s PV to go global.”
Regarding the overheating of the industry, which is being discussed globally, Liu expressed an objective attitude.
“Very similar to human life, the economy also develops in a cyclical manner. Oversupply could be said to be a phase. But from another perspective, with such rapid market replacement and technological iteration, can companies successfully keep up with the development trend of the times? Both China and the global PV industry are advancing rapidly, but we must remain clear-headed and objective, sailing against the current but following the trend.”

1,Gold price surges to six-month high,Global investors were taking a bet in gold on speculation that the US central bank may reduce interest rate,"Gold price soared on Wednesday to a six-month high of Rs225,400 per tola (11.66 grams) as the precious metal took cue from the rising global market that touched an all-time high.
On the other hand, the Pakistani rupee maintained its downtick for the fourth consecutive working day and closed at Rs279.35 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the domestic currency ticked down Rs0.04 on a day-on-day basis.
All Pakistan Saraf Gems and Jewellers Association reported that bullion became costlier by Rs1,500 per tola, with a cumulative surge of 5%, or Rs10,600, in the past six successive working days.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Interactive Commodities Director Adnan Agar said gold hit a record high at $2,149 per ounce (31.10 grams) in the international market late evening (according to Pakistan time), following a quick surge of almost $100 in the past three days.
He said global investors were taking a bet in gold on speculation that the US central bank may reduce interest rate in the coming months. Gold hit the all-time high when the US Fed chairman began a two-day briefing in the Senate on interest rate outlook.
Immediately after hitting the record high, the precious metal shed almost $10 per ounce and saw a correction of $50-60 over the next one week.
Gold straightaway gained $170 to the record high compared to the price of $1,980 per ounce a couple of weeks ago, strongly suggesting a downturn in the global market in the short run.
Meanwhile, the rupee was showing signs of depreciation after gaining 10%, or Rs28, over five and a half months to stand at a more than four-month high of Rs279.11/$ last week. Earlier, it reached an all-time low of Rs307.10/$ in the first week of September 2023.
The downtick in the rupee supported the increase in prices of gold, which is an imported commodity.
According to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP), the rupee regained Rs0.05 to Rs282 in the open market on Wednesday.

2,Egypt secures IMF deal after pound's plunge,A more flexible exchange rate had been a key demand of the IMF,"Egypt secured on Wednesday an expanded $8 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), hours after the central bank unshackled its currency and delivered a 600 basis points rate hike in a push stabilise the economy.
Additionally, Egypt secured another $1.2 billion loan for environmental sustainability, bringing its total loan from the IMF to more than $9 billion, the government and Fund officials said. This was towards the lower end of what some analysts had expected.
The currency weakened to beyond 50 Egyptian pounds to the dollar – far beyond previous records – from about 30.85 pounds, a level Egypt has for months tried to defend. It closed at 49.4 to the dollar.
A more flexible exchange rate had been a key demand of the IMF, which had been in talks with officials to expand the Fund’s current, $3 billion support programme with Egypt.
Egypt has in the past said it would shift to a more flexible exchange rate, only to return to closely managing the currency whenever the pound weakened.
This time, it may be betting that hard currency inflows from investment projects, including a $35 billion investment deal signed in late February with the United Arab Emirates, will prevent a freefall.

3,PBS revises gas price surge to 480%,"Adjusts Nov rates from 1100%, raises questions on impact on inflation metrics","The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics has quietly downward revised its earlier reported increase in gas prices by over half to 480% – a significant adjustment that also contributed to a lower overall inflation rate in February.
The PBS made the revision in the rate of increase in gas prices without making an adjustment in the methodology. The revision was the result of a correction of an error in calculations, said the sources. PBS had earlier reported that the government increased the gas prices up to 1100% in November 2023, but the Ministry of Energy said that the increase was not more than 150%.
A 57% cut in the reported figure of the increase in prices – from 1108% for the lowest strata to 480% – was still below the claims made by the Ministry of Energy.
Just before leaving office, former energy minister Mohammad Ali wrote to Planning Minister Sami Saeed, requesting an adjustment to the inflation figures in light of observations made by the Petroleum Division during recent meetings.
The PBS reported that prices went up by 1109% for Pakistan’s lowest income group, earning up to Rs17,732 per month.
Sources in the Ministry of Planning said that there was an error in calculations, which led to the reporting of a 1109% increase in prices for the lowest quintile. They said that after making this correction, the effective increase in gas prices for the lowest income group was 480%.
But PBS never made a public announcement about the downward revision and quietly released the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) report for the third week of February based on the new numbers. The Chief Statistician Dr Naeemul Zafar claimed that the PBS did not make any adjustment in gas prices.
The PBS report showed that during the week ended on February 22nd, the increase in gas prices for the lowest quintile was 480%. It made a significant adjustment, resulting in a sharp dip in the overall SPI index from 34.2% to 30.6%.
This downward revision in gas prices also contributed to a reduction in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in February, which slowed down to almost a year and a half’s lowest level at 23.1%.
The inflated inflation figures have serious implications for Pakistan’s debt sustainability, as the central bank sets interest rates based on the overall inflation rate. A 1% higher interest rate costs the country’s economy between Rs260 billion to Rs280 billion per annum on the existing debt stock.
In January, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) intervened to resolve the dispute over the actual increase in gas prices. The dispute landed in the SIFC after PBS and the Ministry of Energy provided varying figures two months ago.
The interim government had imposed fixed monthly charges in the range of Rs465 to Rs2,000 per consumer and argued that these charges should not be part of the price increase calculation. However, PBS included the fixed charges in its calculation.
Secondly, the Ministry of Energy claims that the majority of consumers were exempt from the price hike.
The sources said that a meeting of the technical committee held last week decided that no revision in the methodology would be made at this stage.
The outgoing energy minister wrote to the planning minister four days ago and sought to fix the anomalies.
The energy minister expressed the need for PBS to revisit its calculations of the cumulative impact of gas price increases in November 2023, which was around 150% and not just one quintile erroneously computed as 1,100%, and adjust the inflation figures accordingly.
Ali was of the view that the claimed gas price increase of 1100% had implications on SPI and CPI. He pointed out that major anomalies in PBS’s calculations have been identified.
The Petroleum Division argued that the PBS compared the lowest slab of tariff structure of November 2022, when the concept of protected consumers did not exist, with the lowest slabs of non-protected consumers. This led to a comparison of November 2022’s lowest slab tariff of Rs121/mmbtu with the current lowest tariff of non-protected consumers of Rs500/mmbtu with an application of fixed charge of Rs1,000 per month.
The Petroleum Division claimed that PBS’s calculations have errors related to a comparison between different categories of consumers and an increase in tariff instead of the increase in the bill amount.
It claimed that an increase in variable gas tariff and the addition of a fixed monthly charge do not necessarily mean that the increase in tariff will be the same as the increase in the monthly bill amount.
The Petroleum Division further stated that the consumption in hectometre is not converted into energy units which are mmbtu. All these factors, which have not been taken into consideration, have resulted in incorrect calculations of the bill amount.
It further added that currently 57% of the gas consumers in Pakistan fall into the protected consumers’ category that is altogether ignored in PBS’s calculation.
The tariff increase of these protected consumers is minimal, ranging between Rs30-100 per mmbtu, and the application of fixed charge on these consumers is also half or even lesser than the non-protected consumers, according to the Petroleum Division.
It said that ignoring protected consumers has further aggravated the impact of incorrect calculation. The PBS has considered 9.4 million consumers, plotted in the respective slabs. This is based on the number of meters as per 2018 data and their average consumption per month for the year. As gas consumption observes seasonal variations throughout the year, every meter falls under different consumption slabs throughout the year.
It said that averaging their annual consumption leads to a lower number of consumers in the protected category whereas in reality a larger number of consumers were in the protected category during the month of November.
The energy minister wrote that these discrepancies require a thorough re-look into the calculations which are then reflected in tariff increases for reporting in SPI and CPI.

4,Refinery policy to cut imports,"Policy aims to double output of petrol, boost diesel production by 47%","The latest petroleum refinery upgradation policy offers financial incentives, encouraging Pakistan’s industry to significantly increase the production of high-premium products. The policy aims to double the output of petrol and boost diesel production by 47% in the coming years.
This multibillion-dollar and time-consuming initiative is expected to drastically reduce the import of refined products, thereby preserving precious foreign exchange reserves.
Survival for refineries hinges on upgrading their technology by installing deep-conversion refineries, a relatively new technology, alongside existing hydro-skimming refineries. According to a detailed report titled ‘Pakistan’s Refinery Sector Upgradation Policy to Incentivise Refineries’ by Arif Habib Limited (AHL), refineries endorsing the policy will receive additional tariff protection or deemed duty incentives, amounting to 10% for Motor Spirit (MS/petrol) and 2.5% for diesel for seven years.
The upgradation policy is projected to enable refineries to increase total production of MS (petrol) by over 99% and diesel by over 47%, while reducing the production of furnace oil by 78%.
Pakistan’s total average requirement for petroleum products over the last five years stands at 24 million tonnes. Of this, 11.35 million tonnes have been produced locally, while the remainder (12.90 million tonnes) was imported.
Although Pakistan has a total capacity of 20 million tonnes, it has failed to fully utilise it due to lower demand for furnace oil (FO) amid a shift in the energy mix within the power sector. Refineries are unable to significantly alter their production slate, resulting in reduced throughput, said the report.
The government, recognising the situation, announced a policy on August 17, 2023, for the upgradation of brownfield refineries, which was further amended in February 2024.
The government, with industry collaboration, prepared the policy. Respective refineries have already begun feasibility studies for independent upgrades to comply with Euro V specifications, maximise production of MS and diesel, and minimise production of furnace oil (FO).
Presently, Pakistan’s capacity for petrol, diesel, and furnace oil is 10,702 tonnes/day, 21,237 tonnes/day, and 15,417 tonnes/day, respectively.
In late January, Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL) initiated a refinery expansion and upgrade project (REUP) at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion. The project aims to double its installed crude processing capacity to 100,000 barrels per day, boosting the production of high-margin products and low-sulphur fuel, including Euro-V petrol and diesel. The project is set to be completed by the end of 2028.
Explaining the investment source ($1.7 billion), PRL MD/CEO Zahid Mir stated in January that 25% of financing would be provided by the government, while the refinery would arrange $200 million annually by exporting furnace oil. The government collects a 10% duty on petroleum product sales and deposits it in an Escrow account, with funds available for refinery upgrade projects.
AHL anticipates “Attock Refinery Limited to opt for the upgradation agreement soon,” citing ATRL’s strong balance sheet and massive cash position of Rs66 billion (Rs616/share) with no debt.
The upgradation policy imposes a minimum 10% customs duty on imported MS and diesel for seven years, with any excess directed to the Inland Freight Equalisation Margin (IFEM) pool. Refineries ineligible for policy incentives must deposit the excess customs duty in IFEM. Additionally, customs duty on crude oil will be reimbursed to refineries via IFEM.
The policy grants refineries a 10% tariff protection/deemed duty on the ex-refinery price of MS and diesel for seven years. After this period, a 7.5% deemed duty on High-Speed Diesel (HSD) will persist for 20 years or until deregulation, whichever comes first.
Refineries importing used Plant, Machinery, and Equipment (PME) for upgradation can withdraw a maximum of 24.5% of the total project cost from the escrow account. Eligible refineries importing new PME can withdraw up to 27.5% of the total project cost from the escrow account.
Refineries eligible for fiscal incentives in this policy must enter into a legally binding upgrade agreement with OGRA within sixty (60) days following the notification of amendments to this policy. Upon executing the Upgrade Agreement, OGRA will grant a waiver to the respective refinery, allowing it to produce and market non-complying Euro-V specifications until the agreed completion date of the upgradation project, set within six years after signing the agreement.

5,Italy launches visa services from Lahore,"Embassy secretary calls move signal of openness to visitors, business collaborations","Italy has started visa services from the historic city of Lahore while similar facilities will also be launched very soon in other major cities of the country.
It was announced by Italian Embassy First Secretary Augusto Palmeiri while speaking at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI).
Palmeiri highlighted that Lahore held special significance as it was the first city he visited in his official capacity as the embassy secretary. He emphasised the importance of strengthening ties between Italy and Pakistan, both in terms of general cooperation and business ventures.
While noting the symbolic significance of opening visa services in Lahore, he called it a signal of openness to visitors and business collaborations. He underscored the potential of elevating bilateral trade to new highs by setting an ambitious goal of $5 billion.

As part of efforts to deepen trade ties, Palmeiri mentioned plans for a step-by-step approach to encourage entrepreneurs to participate in fairs and exhibitions in Italy. He extended an invitation to businessmen to attend the upcoming expos saying, “These events provide opportunities for networking and fostering B2B connections.” He also outlined the significance of political cooperation through inking memoranda of understanding and trade agreements to facilitate growth.
He mentioned a recent fruitful meeting with the Board of Investment where the potential for Italian investment was emphasised.
Speaking at the meeting, LCCI President Kashif Anwar appreciated the steps taken by the Italian embassy and termed the launch of visa services a great initiative to enhance bilateral trade.
Anwar highlighted that Italy is an important trading partner of Pakistan andcomes at the eighth place among the top exporting destinations.

6,Finance ministry calls for gas supply to FFBL,Says new PPL discovery may be allocated to fertiliser producer,"The Ministry of Finance has asked the Petroleum Division to allocate gas supply to the Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited (FFBL) plant from a new discovery made by Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL).
Earlier, the caretaker government approved an increase in the allocation of gas for third parties from 10% to 35% to tackle the growing circular debt and help exploration companies improve their cash flow.
Exploration and production (E&P) firms have welcomed this initiative as they are trapped in circular debt due to delay in payments by the public gas utilities. They prefer third parties for gas supply where chances of stopping payments are very slim.
In a recent letter sent to the Petroleum Division, the finance ministry said that the proposal of allocating 15 million cubic feet of gas per day (mmcfd) to FFBL from a new PPL discovery, ie, 100% allocation, may be re-examined in light of the recent amendments to the Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Policy, 2012, approved by the Council of Common Interests (CCI).
CCI had decided to increase the share of gas provision to third parties from 10% to 35% by taking provinces on board.
The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) had also agreed that the gas sector should be opened to the private sector to control the circular debt that had crossed Rs2 trillion in the oil and gas sector.
The chief executive officer of an exploration company told The Express Tribune that the increase in allocation for third parties was a good initiative of the government as it would provide a better price for E&P companies.

He said that the gas sector was entangled in the circular debt but the entry of private sector would not only create competition but would also result in fetching better prices.
“This initiative will prove to be an incentive for the exploration companies, encouraging them to drill more wells to find fresh hydrocarbon reserves and reduce dependence on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports,” the CEO said.
Over the past few years, exploration activities in the country had slowed down, constrained by the circular debt that dented the cash flow of E&P companies.
Earlier, PPL withdrew a proposal of allocating gas to Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) due to circular debt fears and asked the federal government to provide gas to FFBL.
In a recent meeting, PPL said that the allocation of Jhim East X-1 discovery to FFBL presented a more economically viable option, considering that the fertiliser producer was likely to make timely payments, thereby mitigating the circular debt crisis afflicting PPL alongside other E&P companies.
The circular debt had been growing due to delayed and non-payment of invoices by the government buyers.
The Ministry of Industries had repeatedly expressed concern in the recent past over the reduced gas supply to FFBL and requested the Petroleum Division to take appropriate measures to ensure adequate supplies, which would lead to uninterrupted urea production.

7,Indus Motor shuts plant for six days,Scarcity of parts forces automaker to suspend production,"Indus Motor Company (IMC) has announced a six-day shutdown of its production plant owing to the shortage of auto parts and components.
In a notice sent to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday, the automaker said that production would remain suspended from March 6 to 11.
“Based on the current low level of inventory of manufactured vehicles, and shortage of parts and components for the manufacturing of vehicles due to supply chain challenges, the company has decided to close its production plant from March 6 to 11. In case of any change in plan, it will be updated accordingly,” the company said.
Earlier too, the company has closed its plant multiple times in the backdrop of inventory challenges faced over the past around one year. “It does not augur well if an automaker closes its production plant for a week. A new but experienced government has come to power and it must announce an industrial policy forthwith with a view to promoting industrialisation, generating jobs and controlling inflation,” auto sector expert Mashood Khan said while sharing his views with The Express Tribune.
“The coming budget will be a test case for the new government to see as to how much relief it is able to provide for the inflation-ridden people,” he said. Khan emphasised that the government must take some austerity measures while cutting down luxurious expenses at government offices and stopping imports of luxury goods and cars.
He pointed out that instead of opening new small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), many existing units were closing down because of the skyrocketing energy cost. “If the industry is not promoted and facilitated, the government will find it difficult to collect revenue to run the affairs of the country in a smooth manner.”
Other market pundits said rising inflation had broken the back of the people and hit their purchasing power to a great extent. They said that auto sales could remain lacklustre during Ramazan and would pick up after Eidul Fitr.

8,APTMA warns of export decline,"Industrialists say rising costs, lack of energy solutions threaten sector viability","The textile industry has cautioned the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) about the likelihood of further declines in exports due to the absence of a financially viable energy source for the industry. It has proposed a set of measures to enhance the competitiveness of textile exports in the global market.
It pointed out the lack of a financially viable energy source for the industry to sustain manufacturing and compete internationally. According to a presentation made to the SIFC, textile millers have urged for the removal of cross-subsidies to non-productive sectors of the economy.
The textile millers’ body, All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA), has suggested the operationalisation of the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contracts Market (CTBCM) to enable business-to-business (B2B) power contracts with a Use of System/Wheeling Charge of 1-1.5 cents/kWh, excluding cross-subsidies and stranded costs. This move aims to enable the industry to procure green energy at competitive end-use prices through captive generation from geothermal plants in depleted oil fields, hybrid solar/wind plants, or other green power producers. Additionally, it calls for increasing the cap on solar net-metering for industrial consumers from 1MW to 5MW, facilitating the transition towards net-zero by adding over 3000 MW of clean energy at the point of usage, with no investment or guarantees from the government.
All three measures are intended to incentivise a shift away from captive gas generation, thereby freeing up domestic gas resources and reducing the Re-Gasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) import bill,” APTMA stated. It has also requested to ensure adequate gas supply to cogeneration units and treat them as industrial consumers, given their efficiency of over 60% and the use of gas supply for steam and hot water related processes in addition to power generation.

The export sector enjoyed regionally competitive energy tariffs (RCET) of 9 cents/kWh in 2021-22, leading to record growth in textiles and apparel exports by 54%, from $12.5 billion in FY20 to $19.3 billion in FY22. However, power tariffs for export-oriented firms rose to over 14 cents/kWh, causing a decline in textiles and apparel exports to $16.5 billion in FY23.
Power tariffs for industrial consumers have increased from 14 cents/kWh to approximately 17.5 cents/kWh (Rs46/kWh) due to quarterly tariff adjustments (QTA) driven by falling power consumption, fuel price adjustment (FPA) of Rs7.056/kWh for Jan 2024, and the expectation of higher QTAs for upcoming quarters as power consumption continues to decline. Production is financially unfeasible at these power tariffs, which are more than twice the average faced by competing firms in regional economies such as Bangladesh (8.6 cents/kWh), India (average of 10.3 cents/kWh; 6 cents/kWh for textile and apparel firms in Maharashtra), and Vietnam (7.2 cents/kWh).
Furthermore, gas prices for industrial consumers have increased to Rs2,750/MMBtu—a 223% increase since January 2023—eliminating the financial viability of captive generation, which a significant part of the industry relied on in the absence of competitively priced grid electricity. Consequently, textiles and apparel exports are stagnating around $1.4 billion per month—$600 million below the installed capacity of $2 billion/month. The investment of approximately $5 billion made during the RCET period in upgrading/expanding manufacturing capacity has become idle, negatively impacting investor returns, sentiment, and confidence in the economy.

9,PSX feels pressure before monetary policy,"KSE-100 index sheds 69.42 points, settles at 65,656.62","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday remained under pressure as investors exercised caution ahead of the monetary policy announcement in mid-March and potential negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a new loan package.
In the morning, trading kicked off with a spike and the market climbed during initial hours. Buying activity was observed throughout the first half as investors cherished Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s directives to open talks with the IMF for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
Bulls dominated proceedings until midday, immediately after which the KSE-100 index touched its intra-day high of 66,150.94.
Afterwards, market sentiment turned negative when investors weighed the potential impact of the upcoming monetary policy announcement and resorted to cautious trading.
They went for profit-booking during the final hour, pushing the bourse slightly into the negative territory. The index shed nearly 70 points and closed below the 66,000 mark.
“Stocks closed lower on investor speculation ahead of monetary policy announcement on March 18 and concerns over the public debt that reached Rs64.84 trillion, up 6.6% for Jul-Jan FY24,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Falling rupee and uncertainty about IMF’s new terms for a long-term bailout to meet the debt servicing shortfall of $6 billion in FY24 played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the market.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a slight decrease of 69.42 points, or 0.11%, and settled at 65,656.62.
Topline Securities Deputy Head of Sales Ali Najib, in his report, said that the “66,000 level is a hard nut to crack”.
“Pakistan equities initiated business on a positive note. The buying momentum can be attributed to the government’s focus on the economy reflecting PM’s directives to the finance ministry to start talks with the IMF on the ongoing standby arrangement, which will lead to the release of last tranche of $1.2 billion, and the potential new programme of around $6-8 billion,” he said.
However, investors chose to resort to some profit-taking above 66,000 points, which pushed the index to shed earlier gains.
Engro Corporation, Mari Petroleum and TRG Pakistan saw some selling as they lost 114 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported that there was “additional churning” around 66,000 before it moved to the new all-time highs.
“S&P Global says it is closely monitoring Pakistan’s external funding situation for the next fiscal year, and there is little doubt about the nation’s ability to fulfill its debt obligations through June. The key thing is securing the IMF funding,” said Yee Farn Phua, sovereign analyst at S&P in Singapore.
“Once the IMF programme is initiated and the government starts working on policies listed in the programme, bilateral partners will also come in for FY25,” AHL added.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that profit-taking continued across the board. “The market opened in the green zone but was unable to sustain that momentum,” he said.
“Going forward, we recommend investors to adopt a buy-on-dips strategy in banking, exploration and production, and technology sectors,” the analyst added.
