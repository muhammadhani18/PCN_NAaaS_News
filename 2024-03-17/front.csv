0,Gas becomes a rarity in Ramazan,Residents of all major cities have to rely on exorbitantly priced LPG cylinders given the load shedding,"Despite provincial governments making promises of uninterrupted gas supply to household users during the month of Ramazan, gas has become a rarity in the Holy Month, which has led to residents relying on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders; resultantly, prices for LPG cylinders have increased.
Tired of the government’s false promises, the populace of the country has started relying on LPG gas cylinders to cook meals for sehri and iftar. This increase in demand has led to dealers of LPG cylinders to exploit the situation and overcharge for the cylinders, which has irked the populace.
One such individual is Shaan, who drives a motorcycle for a ride hailing company in Karachi. “A few days ago the price of a cylinder was Rs 200 but ever since Ramazan started the prices have increased to Rs 500,” bemoaned Shaan, who further complained that the price hike had ruined his monthly budgeting.
Concurring with Shaan, Asif Abbasi, another local, expressed his anger at the fact that the government had increased the price of gas manifold and was a silent spectator as the LPG cylinder mafia was busy profiteering.
Just like Karachiites, the residents of Lahore are similarly perturbed. Muhammad Ejaz, a resident of the city, asserted that the government’s assurances of uninterrupted supply of gas during Ramazan were false.
“The gas schedule given by the Sui Northern Gas Company is not being followed, as a result gas is non-existent. Moreover, people have installed illegal gas generators at their homes, which has exacerbated out plight,” regretted Ejaz. Muhammad Umair, whilst agreeing with Ejaz, opined that the government had left the populace to fend for themselves. “Since there is no gas, if we resort to using electricity, the bills are sky-high.

The other alternative is LPG, which has also become exorbitantly expensive now. What should the people do?” Umair’s frustration is shared by Sakina, a housewife, who resides in Peshawar.
“The gas load shedding has made our lives difficult,” she remarked while talking to the Express Tribune. However, it is not just Sakina whose life has become miserable due to the lack of gas supply.
Zahra, another resident of the city, shares her plight. “Gas is sometimes available from 4 in the evening to 7 in the evening and if we are lucky it is also available from 4 in the morning to 7 in the morning.
However, with such a limited time slot, neither can we cook properly, nor can we make breakfast for the children, who are not fasting,” she explained.
“What has made matters worse are the high prices of LPG cylinders. One kilogram of LPG is retailing for Rs 350, which is out of reach for middle class families,” she added.
In light of the plight of the people, the Express Tribune also spoke to the LPG Distributors Association.
“The official price of LPG is Rs 257 per kilogram.
However, it is true that hoarders and profiteers are retailing LPG between Rs 300 and Rs 350,” conceded Irfan Khokhar, Chairman of the LPG Distributors Association of Pakistan. Sikandar Khan, an LPG dealer in Peshawar, also made a similar concession, while talking to the Express Tribune.
“Even though LPG prices have increased, it is true that dealers are engaging in profiteering due to the lack of supply of Sui gas,” said Khan.
Given Khokhar and Khan’s revelations, the Express Tribune inquired from the Spokesperson of the Sui Southern Gas Company, about the lack of uninterrupted gas supply during Ramazan. “We are doing our best to ensure supply of gas during sehri and iftar hours,” maintained the Spokesperson.

2,"PML-N, PTI clash over martyr insults",Ministers slam social media campaign against fallen soldiers; former ruling party denies,"The ruling PML-N on Sunday accused the PTI of running a malicious social media campaign to insult the martyrs of the armed forces, an accusation vehemently denied by the latter, which stated that martyrs were the nation’s collective assets, beyond all political divisions.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore, Information Minister Atta Tarar claimed that the PTI was targeting the army in collusion with India. “The Pakistan Army is the guarantee of our survival. This campaign to insult our martyrs is unacceptable, and the people responsible for it will be brought to justice,” he said.
The minister said that fake accounts of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) were created on social media platforms to mock the army. He pointed the finger at the PTI, alleging that the party had earlier mocked soldiers martyred in Waziristan and Lasbela.
“This party has a track record of launching derogatory and mocking campaigns on the social media regarding the sacrifices of the martyrs in the past as well. We strongly condemn such reprehensible actions,” he said.
Tarar said the social media accounts involved in insulting the martyrs would be identified, and action would be taken against them. “Many accounts are being operated from abroad, but some followers are also from Pakistan. Lists of individuals involved from Pakistan and abroad are being compiled,” he said.
Tarar alleged the PTI had been involved in activities that were harming the interests of the country. He referred to party founder Imran Khan’s alleged letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), asking it not to engage with the current political dispensation, as well as the alleged PTI supporters’ protest outside the IMF headquarters in the US.
“The PTI should openly condemn the people who raised slogans against Pakistan outside the IMF building and ran a campaign against our martyrs,” he said.

Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, while separately speaking to the media in his hometown of Sialkot, also condemned the malicious campaign against the martyred soldiers, while claiming that the campaign being run by “a political party” was “anti-state”.
“A political party launched a campaign on social media and mocked the sacrifices of the martyrs. Nothing can be more anti-state than this. Dragging martyrs into electoral disputes is a despicable act,” the defence minister said.
Asif said that the most of terrorism was emanating from the Afghan soil. He claimed that there was a connection between those who make statements against the martyrs, and the terrorists. “The same people who are coming to Pakistan from Afghanistan are providing them shelter,” he added.
Hitting out at the PTI, he said the former ruling party had lost its identity. “Today, it is an unnamed party. Who knows who is running this party, who is sitting abroad and hurling insults at the country,” he said.
Responding to the federal ministers media talks, a PTI’s spokesperson issued statement that said that “martyrs of the armed forces are our heroes and a common asset of the nation, without any political or group divisions”.
“Those who disrespect the martyrs by exploiting their sacrifices for their petty political gains are the real criminals,” he added. The spokesperson alleged that malicious attacks on the armed forces and its martyrs were consistent with the tradition of the PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, his daughter Maryam Nawaz, and his “courtiers”.
“Khawaja Asif and Atta Tarar are among those criminals rejected by the public, yet they were brought into parliament through rigged mandates.” the spokesperson said, adding that the assaults on the sanctity and status of martyrs from within the federal cabinet were a significant test for the state itself.
“The usurper prime minister should hold his ministers accountable, and refrain from exploiting the martyrs for his political ends, which only serves to hurt the sentiments of their families and the nation,” he added.

3,Aseefa’s political debut begins,Youngest daughter of President Zardari submits nominations papers for NA-207 by-polls,"Aseefa Bhutto Zardari, the youngest daughter of President Asif Ali Zardari, took her first step into electoral politics on Sunday by submitting her nomination papers for a by-election for the NA-207 Shaheed Benazirabad seat, vacated by Zardari after assuming the presidency last week.
The nomination papers of the young scion of the Bhutto dynasty were received by the returning officer, Additional Deputy Commissioner Sher Ali Jamali, in the presence of her aunt, provincial minister Azra Fazal Pechuho, and a large number of local PPP leaders and workers.
Aseefa has been actively involved in PPP's political activities and election campaigns for many years, but this marks her debut in any electoral contest.
Unlike her brother, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who chose to contest from Larkana, Aseefa will be launching her parliamentary career from her father's hometown.
During her canvassing for the last general elections, she led rallies across Sindh while her brother focused on leading the party's campaign in Punjab. She also campaigned for the party's candidates in the local government elections of 2022.
In the February 8 general elections, Zardari secured 146,989 votes in NA-207. His opponent, the PTI- and GDA-backed independent candidate Sardar Sher Muhammad Rind Baloch, polled 51,916 votes.
Baloch, along with other candidates including MQM-P's Syed Sajjad Hussain Shah, will also contest the by-polls.

Addressing workers and supporters at Zardari House Nawabshah on Saturday, Aseefa said, ""The people of Nawabshah elected my father by giving him a huge mandate. I hope the people will also give me the same mandate.""
Pechuho, also elected as an MPA from a constituency in the same district, remarked that Aseefa embodies the spirit of former prime minister and PPP's slain chairperson Benazir Bhutto.
""Watching Aseefa makes us feel as if Shaheed Benazir is present among us."" She appealed to the people of Shaheed Benazirabad to give Aseefa a huge mandate in her first electoral contest.
The Bhutto-Zardari dynasty won three seats in the National Assembly and two in the Sindh Assembly from Larkana, Shaheed Benazirabad, and Qambar-Shahdadkot in the February 8 general elections.
Bilawal was elected an MNA from two constituencies and Zardari from one. Faryal Talpur and Pechuho, Zardari's sisters, were elected MPAs from Larkana and Shaheed Benazirabad, respectively.
Bilawal took the oath of an MNA for NA-194 Larkana, vacating NA-196 Qambar Shahdadkot seat, which will undergo a by-election on April 21. The PPP's chairman obtained 85,370 votes at NA-196 while his opponent from JUI-F, Nasir Mehmood Soomro, polled 34,499 votes.

Soomro's brother, Rashid Mehmood Soomro had fought against Bilawal at NA-194 Larkana with the former getting 35,311 votes and the latter winning the seat with a margin of around 100,000 votes.
The PPP has given a ticket for the constituency to Khursheed Ahmad Junejo, who was elected an MNA from the same seat in 2018 general elections. He also served a stint as an MPA from 2013 to 2018.
Junejo's son barrister Buland Khan Junejo, PPP's district president Qamaruddin Gopang, JUI-F's Rashid Mehmood and Nasir Mehmood, Hafiz Saddam Hussain Brohi of the TLP, former MPA Sultan Ahmed Khuawarh, PTI backed Naheed Khuawarh are among the people who have submitted forms for NA-196.
