0,IMF assured: No more funds for CPEC,"Fund questions increase of Rs7/unit in electricity prices, circular debt handling","Pakistan has assured the International Monetary Fund that it does not plan to allocate additional budget to settle the Rs493 billion dues of Chinese power plants. The global lender is also questioning the efficacy of the power sector’s anti-theft campaign.
The government also faced questions about a record Rs7 per unit increase in electricity prices in March due to the energy ministry’s faulty policy of using expensive imported fuels, according to sources.
The Fund is sceptical about the government’s claim of restricting losses due to non-recovery of bills to Rs263 billion in this fiscal year, as the amount has already almost reached Rs200 billion in just seven months. This has serious implications for restricting the overall circular debt to Rs2.31 trillion by June this year.
The IMF inquired about the government’s decision on the allocation of funds for the Chinese power plants over and above the budgeted amount of Rs48 billion for this fiscal year, said officials of the Ministry of Energy.
They added that the IMF was informed there was no plan to approve additional funds for retiring the outstanding debt of the Chinese power plants.
The outstanding dues of power projects of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) alarmingly increased to a record Rs493 billion or $1.8 billion as of end January. The amount was Rs214 billion or 77% higher than June last year.
The build-up of Chinese debt violates the 2015 Energy Framework Agreement, which binds Pakistan to allocate sufficient money in a special fund to keep Chinese investors immune from the circular debt. However, the government is allocating only Rs48 billion annually with a condition to withdraw a maximum of Rs4 billion per month.
Sources said the IMF appeared sceptical about the long-term success of the government’s anti-theft campaign and the military’s involvement in monitoring the performance of power distribution companies.

Energy ministry officials said the IMF believes the anti-theft campaign can work only in the short term and the government needs to focus on digital monitoring of the power distribution network.
The government claimed it has recovered Rs82 billion in this fiscal year because of its anti-theft campaign, although there is no publicly available breakup about recoveries from private and public sector consumers.
Sources said the IMF’s view was that such measures can only be beneficial in the short term. The IMF also did not appear satisfied with the involvement of third parties in monitoring the anti-theft campaign, said the sources. For the global lender, as such interventions could diminish the role of power distribution company management and their boards.
The low recovery of bills and high line losses contribute annually to Rs589 billion in the circular debt build-up – a sum that the government recovers either through further price increases or budget subsidies.
For this fiscal year, the government estimates Rs263 billion in losses due to lower bill recovery by power distribution companies. Despite the anti-theft campaign, in seven months, there has already been an increase of Rs200 billion under this head.
Energy ministry officials claimed before the IMF that recoveries have increased to 92% of the billed amount, marginally better than last year. They further said recoveries would improve once billing increases during the summer period.
The energy ministry officials said the finance ministry would release over Rs250 billion in subsidies this month to keep the circular debt flow at the agreed level for this fiscal year.
The IMF was informed that circular debt increased by Rs378 billion during the first half, jumping to Rs545 billion by end March. However, the government has agreed to keep the overall debt stock at Rs2.310 trillion by settling the addition through the budget by June this year.
The government also faced IMF questions over a sharp monthly increase of Rs7 per unit due to monthly fuel cost adjustment in electricity bills. The sharp increase highlighted mismanagement by the energy ministry, which failed to implement planned use of various fuels to keep prices low.
Sources said the IMF argued there was no justification for the Rs7 per unit increase when the exchange rate was stable and global commodity prices did not change.
The energy ministry explained the government had to seek the price increase due to using expensive fuels during winter for electricity generation. High-speed diesel, furnace oil, and imported gas were used due to a faulty policy of allocating cheaper local gas to other sources.
Sources said the IMF has also sought a fresh timeline for ending agriculture tube-well subsidies in Balochistan.

1,Google misquoted exchange rate: Malaysia,"Insists tech giant undervalued currency, seeks explanation","Malaysia’s central bank said on Saturday that Google had misquoted the ringgit’s exchange rate, undervaluing the currency against the dollar, and that it would seek an explanation from the tech giant.
The ringgit, which declined to a 26-year low last month, has weakened about 2.44% this year. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has said the currency is undervalued and does not reflect Malaysia’s positive economic fundamentals.
The bank said in a statement that Alphabet Inc’s Google published “inaccurate” information on Friday and had also done so on February 6. 
“As this is the second instance of misreporting, BNM will be engaging Google for an explanation of how the inaccurate reporting occurred and the corrective measures taken given that this is a recurring issue that has afflicted Malaysia and other countries in the past few months,” BNM said in a statement.
It did not elaborate. Google was not immediately available for comment outside of US business hours.
The search giant does not verify data provided by financial exchanges and other content providers, and disclaims any obligation to do so, according to disclaimers on its website.
Google quoted the ringgit at 4.98 to the dollar on Friday, BNM said, while the Malaysian currency’s weakest level on official data was 4.7075.

2,UK sees trade talks with India on hold,"Earlier this week, Modi and British PM Rishi Sunak reaffirmed their commitment to securing a new trade deal","The latest round of trade talks between Britain and India has concluded without a deal, with a British official saying an agreement could not be finalised ahead of the upcoming Indian elections.
The two countries have held stop-start talks over a free trade agreement for two years and both are set to hold elections in 2024. PM Narendra Modi will bid for a rare third term in a vote that is due by May, with the exact date yet to be announced.
“Neither side is walking away from talks,” said one British official. “We simply do not yet have what we need to finalise a deal that meets our joint ambitions.”
Earlier this week, Modi and British PM Rishi Sunak reaffirmed their commitment to securing a new trade deal. “The UK has been crystal clear that we won’t agree a deal until we reach ambitious outcomes on goods, services, and investment,” the British official said on Friday.

3,US investigates Meta for role in drug sales,"FDA supports probe, Meta pledges cooperation in investigation","US prosecutors in Virginia are probing whether Facebook-parent Meta’s social media platforms facilitated and profited from the illegal sale of drugs, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, citing documents and people familiar with the matter.
The prosecutors sent subpoenas last year and have been asking questions as part of a criminal grand jury probe, the report said, adding that they have also been requesting records related to drug content or illicit sale of drugs via Meta’s platforms.
The Food and Drug Administration has also been helping with the investigation, the newspaper added. It noted that investigations do not always lead to charges of wrongdoing. The paper quoted a spokesman for Meta as saying in a statement: “The sale of illicit drugs is against our policies and we work to find and remove this content from our services”. “Meta proactively cooperates with law enforcement authorities to help combat the sale and distribution of illicit drugs,” he added.
The prosecutors’ office and a spokeswoman for the FDA declined to comment to WSJ.
Meta, the FDA and the Virginia Attorney General’s office did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment. Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said on social media platform X on Friday that Meta had joined up with the US State Department, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and Snapchat to help disrupt the sale of synthetic drugs online and educate users about the associated risks.

4,Textile sector seeks support to fully utilise GSP Plus,Hosiery manufacturers pledge to work with govt to lift exports,"Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers Association (PHMA) leadership has vowed that the value-added textile industry will work closely with the new government in a bid to enhance exports and rejuvenate the growth momentum.
In a statement, PHMA Zonal Chairman Farrukh Iqbal asked the government to provide its backing for the value-added apparel sector, so that it could utilise its potential to reap benefits of the GSP Plus preferential trade facility and provide mass employment to the jobless population.
“Exports to EU countries have started dropping, which is a matter of grave concern,” he said.
Iqbal hailed the recent government move to release Rs65 billion worth of verified pending tax refunds of exporters until February 2024. “This is a welcome move from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and we appreciate him along with his team, as this will definitely boost the confidence of exporters and encourage the export sector.”
He expressed hope that the same spirit would be followed for the release of the remaining refunds of deferred sales tax and under schemes like Duty Drawback of Taxes and Drawback of Local Taxes and Levies, the Technology Up-gradation Fund and markup subsidy in order to raise exports.

As energy prices had escalated to record highs, the PHMA leader pointed out that frequent hikes in gas and power tariffs would further stoke inflation, amidst high markup, making Pakistani value-added textile products uncompetitive in the international market.
He termed the increase in energy tariffs an unwise move that would sabotage the efforts of exporters.
He asked the new government to ensure a level-playing field by offering regionally competitive energy tariffs and continuing the DLTL scheme, as committed in the new five-year textile and apparel policy.
Iqbal was of the view that energy rates for industries should be brought at par or below tariffs prevailing in the competing regional countries.
Pakistan needs an even playing field with regional competitors through the continuation of previous concessionary energy tariffs for the export industry.
Pointing to the fall in exports to the EU, the PHMA zonal chairman said that Pakistan’s exports to European nations dipped 7.54% year-on-year in the first seven months of the current fiscal year, primarily due to reduced demand for Pakistani goods in western, southern and northern Europe.
Export proceeds from those countries dropped to $4.866 billion in July-January FY24, against shipments of $5.263 billion recorded in the corresponding period of the previous year, according to figures compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
This decline in export earnings indicates the challenges faced by Pakistani exporters in these uncertain economic times despite having preferential trade access to the 27-member EU bloc.

5,PBF says agri-sector capable of doubling $3b contribution,"Urges govt to control cartels, market manipulation to aid exploited farmers","Pakistan Business Forum (PBF) Vice President Jahan Ara Wattoo stated that Pakistan’s agriculture sector holds great potential, and its current contribution of $3 billion to the economy could be doubled with viable approaches covering all aspects of this vital sector and addressing stakeholders’ concerns.
Addressing a workshop on Saturday, she highlighted the urgent need to control cartels in commodity markets to enable the crop component of the agriculture sector to yield tangible results. She noted that the government has high expectations from cotton growers and cited the example of when it declared an indicative price of Rs8,500 per 40kg, leading to a strong revival of crops and doubling production in just one season. However, once cotton started arriving in the market, the price crashed to Rs6,500 per maund as market cartels exploited the farmers.
“We observed the same phenomenon in the maize crop, with its price dwindling to half its pre-sowing value,” she maintained, adding that, “In a production cycle with very high costs, price slides like these leave farmers crippled for years. For urea alone, growers paid more than Rs120 billion to black marketers this season, as urea bags were being sold in the market at four different prices.”
Read: Minister pushes for agricultural growth
Jahan Ara added that other agricultural inputs such as diesel, electricity, water, and labor for cropping/farming are also very costly, while growers by and large have to pay a 22% bank markup, leaving most farmers under heavy debts for years after these massive expenses.
PBF Chairman (South Punjab) Malik Suhail Talat remarked, “Agriculture does not fit into calendar years; it is all about continuity. Decisions made in 2024 regarding what to sow and what not to sow will define 2025. For the last decade or so, maize has anchored agriculture. With its price crashing, each farmer will now have to decide whether to continue with the maize crop or not.”
He described Punjab’s wheat policy as confusing, noting that wheat procurement and release prices were changed twice in the last two months, leaving farmers in a financial and policy quandary. The cotton crash has left farmers unsure about its future, he said, adding that early potato crop prices slid after initial better returns, leaving growers to consider other options. He claimed that capitalists were manipulating political, economic, and other systems in the country. He urged all political parties, the public and private sectors, and all stakeholders to make collaborative efforts to address this issue.

6,SBP faces dilemma over interest rate,Experts split as decision looms on whether to cut or maintain record high rate,"Pakistan’s central bank is scheduled to meet on Monday to determine the benchmark interest rate for the next six weeks. It will be a highly tricky meeting with almost half of the financial experts and key investors betting on the bank cutting the rate, while the remaining half believe the financial regulator will leave the rate unchanged at the prevailing record high of 22%.
The arguments on both sides of the fence agree on one key point: the real benchmark policy rate (traditionally called the real interest rate) stands significantly positive (5-6 percentage points) on a 12-month forward-looking basis, as the inflation reading is projected to decelerate to 16-17% in December 2024. The real rate will also turn positive on a spot basis this month when the benchmark inflation reading (consumer product index/CPI) is estimated to slow down to 20-21% in March 2024, making the real interest rate positive by 1-2 percentage points.
Earlier, the central bank had adopted a forward-looking approach to control inflation, raising the policy rate cumulatively by 15 percentage points between September 2021 and June 2023 to 22%. Recent decisions indicate that the bank has become overcautious on inflation under the International Monetary Fund loan programme, closely monitoring datasets and apparently abandoning the forward-looking approach.
Those who believe in a rate cut on Monday argue that the high interest rate is taking a heavy toll on economic growth. The high interest rate has squeezed the financial space of the government, leaving almost no funds with the federal government after paying interest on the total debt. Estimates suggest that a one percentage point hike in the policy rate increases interest payments by Rs200-250 billion by the federal government in Pakistan.
The high interest rate has strained the balance sheets of businesses, requiring them to restructure debt with banks. Additionally, demand has been severely suppressed for products like cement, fertiliser, petroleum products, electricity, and cars.
The other side argues that the bank will maintain the rate at an all-time high as the government negotiates with the IMF for the last tranche of $1.1 billion and for securing a new package – larger and longer – by the time the ongoing $3 billion programme ends in March-April 2024.
The IMF recommends that the SBP maintain a tight monetary policy but does not dictate what interest rate makes the policy tight or soft.
In their surveys of key investors including bankers, industrialists, manufacturers, and mutual funds, Topline Research found that 55% estimate no rate cut in March, while 45% believe in a cut in the rate of 25 basis points to over 100 basis points. The research house itself stands in the majority camp.
Read: Interest rate status quo
Arif Habib Limited’s survey suggests that 53% of respondents see no rate cut, while the remaining 47% anticipate a cut in the range of less than 100 basis points to 200 basis points. AHL itself foresees a 100 basis point cut on Monday.
Treshmark projects the SBP to cut the policy rate by 100 basis points as aggregated demand in the economy is significantly down, the current account deficit is well-contained, the rupee is rising against the dollar, the political environment is much better, and the business community is being stretched by substantially higher financing costs.
Optimus Capital Management’s Head of Research, Maaz Azam, expects a cut of 100 basis points. He said downward revision is expected as the economy has slowed significantly, and with depleted purchasing power, any notable uptick in demand seems unlikely.
Moreover, the current account deficit (CAD) is expected to remain contained despite lifting LC (import) restrictions. Although headline inflation appears inflated, it has sharply decreased, with March 2024 inflation expected to be around 20%, and core inflation has subsided as well and is expected to be around 16% in Mar-24.
“The IMF review should not be a hurdle as the real interest rate will be positive on both a spot and forward-looking basis,” Azam said.
AHL says a data-driven approach will be pivotal in forming the SBP’s decision-making process. This approach would likely take into consideration the downward trajectory of both headline and core inflation, which it anticipates to average approximately 17% and 15% respectively (on a 12-month forward basis), resulting in significantly positive real interest rates on a forward-looking basis. “This aspect was also underscored in the SBP’s previous MPS (monetary policy statement).”
Several contributing factors, including the substantial base effect, stabilisation of global commodity prices, support from the stability of the rupee against the US dollar, and efforts to curtail the current account deficit, underpin expectations for the rate cut.
Topline Research believes that the SBP will remain cautious despite encouraging trends and adopt a ‘watch and see’ approach until the inflation trend maintains its fall, meaning no change in the policy rate on Monday.
“Key risks to the inflation trajectory include delay in the release of IMF funds, IMF demanding additional tax measures to meet revenue target in case of any shortfall, and pressure on the dollar against the rupee mainly due to delays in getting dollar inflows,” it said.

7,Salt industry struggles amid shipping crisis,"SMAP leaders urge govt to reverse trade ban with India, reduce taxes to revitalise sector","Salt Manufacturers Association of Pakistan (SMAP) leaders have urged the government to lift the ban on trade with India and reduce taxes on imported salt materials, including packaging and others, to revitalise the salt trade sector.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, they highlighted that rising production costs and high taxes on imported salt materials have hindered competitiveness in the international market, causing distress among salt manufacturers.
Additionally, they noted that higher freight transportation costs have been significantly impacting the local salt industry due to issues in the Red Sea stemming from Israel’s war on Palestine. Since November 2023, high-value cargo ships have faced attacks in the Red Sea as a result of the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Palestine. These attacks have forced shipping lines or companies to reroute, resulting in longer voyages with increased freight transportation charges. It’s worth mentioning that freight services are still below the levels seen during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021.
“For years, the salt trade has grappled with numerous challenges, hindering smooth operations and affecting various stakeholders within the industry,” stated SMAP Chairman Qasim Yaqoob Paracha.
“One significant hurdle is the trade ban with India, which has led to decreased revenue for salt manufacturers, disrupted trade routes, and diminished overall profitability in this sector,” he said.

Paracha highlighted the need for collaborative efforts between the government and industry stakeholders to address these challenges. He suggested that through constructive dialogue and effective policy implementation, comprehensive solutions could be devised to revitalise the salt trade and unleash its full potential.
“We can foster a conducive environment for the sustainable growth and development of this sector, thereby contributing to the overall socio-economic development of the country,” he expressed, adding that, “We anticipate proactive initiatives and decisive actions from the government in resolving these issues, ushering in an era of progress and prosperity for all stakeholders.”
Sharing insights into the local salt industry, SMAP Founding Chairman Ismail Suttar, who also serves as the CEO of Hubpak Salt Refinery, revealed that aside from approximately 300 salt exporting companies, there are around 800 firms engaged in mining and processing salt in the country. Moreover, an estimated 300,000 individuals earn a decent living from this industry.
Approximately 4 million tonnes of salt are consumed locally each year, with 90% (3.6 million tonnes) allocated for industrial purposes such as caustic soda, glass, and PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride), while the remaining 10% (400,000 tonnes) is earmarked for edible salt. The country boasts three primary types of salt: sea salt, lake salt, and rock salt, each with distinct colours including white, pink, and others. These salts are sourced from regions such as Khewra, Tharparker, Mauripur, Ibrahim Haideri, and various other areas across the country.

8,PSX under pressure over IMF talk concerns,"KSE-100 index drops 977 points, or 1.5% WoW, settles at 64,816","Turbulence and uncertainty marred the outgoing week at Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), as the market underwent a bearish spell by closing four out of five sessions in the red.
Uncertainty about securing a new, longer-term loan package in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) kept the KSE-100 index under constant pressure.
The week kicked off on a sour note due to mounting selling pressure in selective stocks and a weak economic outlook, which kept investors at bay on Monday.
The KSE-100 index fell sharply on Tuesday, losing over 950 points with multiple factors including the weak rupee, monetary policy uncertainty, high inflation and the imminent IMF review denting investor sentiment.
The upcoming monetary policy announcement deterred investors, who otherwise had positive hopes from the IMF review under its $3 billion standby arrangement (SBA), which fuelled the bearish mood and the index dropped another 750 points on Wednesday.
The market rebounded on Thursday, soaring over 1,000 points as investor confidence returned over finance ministry’s assurance of Pakistan being in a good shape to successfully complete the SBA and secure a longer-term loan programme. However, the trend reversed in the following session when investors opted to book profits and stood on sidelines over economic concerns.
With all the gloom, the benchmark KSE-100 index lost 977 points, or 1.5% week-on-week (WoW), and settled at 64,816.
JS Research analyst Shagufta Irshad, in her report, stated that the stock market experienced high volatility throughout the week, resulting in negative close for four out of five trading days.
Read: PSX slumps on rate, IMF review uncertainty
Average traded volumes contracted 20% WoW, which depicted a reduced market activity as Ramazan began, she added.
New cabinet ministers taking charge of their offices and subsequent arrival of an IMF delegation for final review of the $3 billion SBA were the key highlights of the week.
The newly elected government remained quite firm about meeting all the structural benchmarks, quantitative and indicative targets set by the IMF. The IMF team reportedly expressed some concern about the government’s forthcoming strategies to address the anticipated revenue shortfall in 4QFY24 and reduce the circular debt in the energy sector. It is noteworthy that the review report will be submitted to the IMF executive committee by the second week of April for approval of a $1.1 billion tranche.
On the macroeconomic front, cut-off yields on Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) remained unchanged compared to the previous auction, with three, five and 10-year yields standing at 16.8%, 15.5% and 14.35%, respectively. Moreover, the State Bank’s reserves remained stable at $7.9 billion, the JS analyst added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) wrote in its report that the stock market remained under pressure throughout the week, primarily due to divided opinions about the upcoming monetary policy, alongside negotiations with the IMF for a final SBA review.
Concurrently, the formation of the cabinet and the appointment of Muhammad Aurangzeb as finance minister put the lingering uncertainties to rest.
On the economic front, the government raised Rs93 billion against the target of Rs50 billion through the auction of Ijarah Sukuk while broad money (M2) increased Rs496 billion to Rs32.7 trillion. Additionally, the rupee appreciated slightly, closing at 278.74 against the US dollar, with WoW increase of Rs0.29, or 0.11%.
In terms of sectors, positive contribution came from automobile parts (20 points), paper and board (6 points), and chemicals (4 points). Negative contributors were fertiliser (215 points), oil and gas exploration (190 points), commercial banks (174 points), oil and gas marketing companies (103 points) and power (55 points).
Foreign investors’ buying continued during the week under review, which came in at $2.7 million compared to net buying of $6.3 million last week, AHL added.

9,Nine new trade missions planned abroad,Govt requires Rs70m for these missions that will help raise exports,"Pakistan has decided to establish nine new trade missions in Africa, Europe and Asia in an effort to boost trade with these regions as exports of the country have remained stagnant at around $25 billion, though its peers have gone far ahead.
Pakistan has not been able to enhance exports since decades owing to the failure of its trade missions abroad to promote the country’s goods and the inconsistent domestic policies. Sources told The Express Tribune that the government would require an annual budget of Rs70 million for setting up the new trade missions.
The current Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government will allocate these funds in the next budget for fiscal year 2024-25. According to officials of the commerce ministry, two new trade missions each will be set up in Africa and Europe. Apart from these, five trade missions will be established in Asia.
They said the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) had accorded formal approval to the plan. It also gave the green light, in principle, for the required cost and directed the Ministry of Commerce to seek the allocation of funds in the FY25 budget.
The setting up of new missions is apparently part of the “Look Africa” policy being pursued by Pakistan to enhance trade. Earlier, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government too had been advocating a similar policy in an attempt to tap the vast market of South Africa valuing at $100 billion.

Pakistan’s share in this $100 billion market is negligible. Exporters have traditionally focused on the Middle Eastern, United States and European markets. However, there is a lot of potential in the South African market, which can help Pakistan to increase its stagnant exports.
Pakistan’s trade with the African continent had been stagnant at $3 billion per annum over the past few years. However, it crossed the $4 billion mark and reached $4.18 billion in fiscal year 2019-20.
According to officials, the key reason for the thin trade volume was the lack of engagement between Pakistan and Africa. To boost its market share in African nations, the Ministry of Commerce had launched the “Look Africa” policy in August 2017.
Commerce ministry officials say that the establishment of two new trade missions will help raise the level of engagement between Pakistan and Africa. The missions will work as a bridge between Pakistani and African traders.
In the case of Europe, Pakistan has been enjoying the GSP Plus status for around 10 years, which gave a boost to export volumes. European countries have granted duty incentives of $1 billion to Pakistan.
The setting up of two new trade missions in Europe is part of the government policy to deepen its engagement with European states to grab a larger slice of the huge market.
Central Asia is a market that has long been neglected by Pakistani exporters. On the other hand, Indian lobby is very active in Central Asia, allegedly working to undermine the influence of Pakistan there.
During the previous PML-N government, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif increasingly focused on exploring the new Central Asian market. He was keen to sign a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) – the Russia-dominated bloc, and even visited many countries in the region. EEU comprises Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. However, Pakistan has no diplomatic relations with Armenia, which is why it has not been able to sign the free trade deal.
