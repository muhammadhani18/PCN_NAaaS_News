0,Combatting Katcha dacoits,Menace poses a serious threat to people by luring them into certain traps,"Among other nuisances that Pakistan is currently plagued with, the escalating cases of katcha (riverine areas) dacoit have lately engaged the country’s law enforcement and spread mental and emotional harassment among people. The menace poses a serious threat to people by luring them into certain traps. These can range from men enticed into stimulating friendships by women, or in other cases, falling trap to monetary or other material incentives through deceitful means. As the victims proceed towards the guided physical locations, they are kidnapped and a hefty ransom is demanded of their families. Cases reported by local news agencies reveal that these dacoits are based in northern and central parts of Sindh and operate across the country, but mainly in Sindh and Punjab.
Katcha dacoit cases have been prevalent over the last few years, but they have been soaring since last year. In 2019, the Sindh and Punjab police collaboratively launched a crackdown in the provinces locating the criminals’ hideouts. However, there is a dire need for the operation to not only accelerate, but also improve the efficacy of the targets. In addition to citizens’ safety and the general law and order situation of the country, an improved systematic operation is required that addresses the protection and security of law enforcement personnel. 
A number of police officers are reported to have been killed an injured in counter-shootouts, which is a serious hazard to how fast the security forces are falling in numbers. Not that the system lacks a sound mechanism to ensure security personnel’s safety, but strengthening the crackdown alone can foil the mushrooming of the menace. 
Katcha areas in Sindh cities like Karachi, Larkana, Sukkur and Thatta must be evacuated, as these areas become hiding grounds for dacoits when an operation cleans up a katcha area from their hub in Interior Sindh. However, clean-up operations in Karachi frequently face resistance from local authorities that claim developmental work in progress in these areas. While police superintendents from certain areas of Sindh and Punjab have vaguely hinted at the presence of masterminds of dacoit groups, it becomes imperative that these be targeted. This will add another strategic step to the crackdown and prevent the proliferation of dacoit groups in other parts of the country where at this stage, channels exist to facilitate the supply of weapons to dacoit groups.

1,Kyrgyz envoy stresses deep economic cooperation,"Says Kyrgyzstan has made liberal laws to woo investors, facilitate mega projects","Kyrgyzstan Ambassador Ullanbek Totuiaev has underscored the importance of prioritising trade, economic relations and investment, saying deepening of partnerships in these areas will be mutually beneficial for both nations.
Speaking at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), the envoy emphasised the deep historical, religious and cultural ties between Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan with significant potential for bilateral cooperation across various sectors.
He pointed out that former LCCI senior vice president Meher Kashif Younis had been appointed honorary consul general of Kyrgyzstan and the establishment of Kyrgyz Trade House in Lahore was being hailed as a positive step to enhance bilateral relations.
The ambassador outlined Kyrgyzstan’s conducive investment climate with liberal laws attracting foreign investment and facilitating large-scale projects.
He was of the view that joint business forums had been instrumental in fostering collaboration and there were plans for establishing more forums in the upcoming year to promote the participation of major companies. Kyrgyzstan has shown interest in various sectors, including agriculture, pharmaceuticals and textiles from Pakistan but challenges exist such as price competition with other markets.
While considering disruptions in traditional supply chains due to conflicts in neighbouring regions, the two sides discussed efforts to expand pharmaceutical exports to Eurasia.
The embassy of Kyrgyzstan offered to provide comprehensive information on sectors like energy, agriculture and food production to the Lahore Chamber to strengthen trade and economic partnerships.
The ambassador addressed logistical challenges, including border closures between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and highlighted the significance of the quadrilateral transit trade agreement among Pakistan, China, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.
He commended initiatives such as the National Logistics Company (NLC)-operated route through Karakoram, which reduced transit time significantly.
Moreover, he mentioned the ongoing establishment of railway connections between China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, welcoming Pakistan’s involvement through Afghanistan in the project.
Speaking at the meeting, LCCI President Kashif Anwar cited that Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan were members of important international organisations including the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO).
According to the State Bank of Pakistan, Pakistan’s exports to Kyrgyzstan stood around $2.6 million in 2021-22, which increased to $9.9 million in 2022-23. Exports were mainly dominated by pharmaceutical products. On the other hand, Pakistan’s imports from Kyrgyzstan were quite negligible.

2,‘China’s opening conducive to foreign businesses’,A major driver of growth will be renewable energy and related industries and infrastructure,"“China aims to facilitate easier access to work, study and travel for foreign nationals in the country. Its commitment to a wider opening and promoting mutual benefits creates a conducive environment for foreign businesses to thrive,” remarked Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).
“The well-developed infrastructure and complete industrial system in China enhance its attractiveness to foreign companies and investors,” he told China Economic Net (CEN).
On March 5, the 2024 Government Work Report was delivered during the Two Sessions, the yearly plenary meetings of China’s top legislature and top political advisory body.
It sets the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth target at around 5% for 2024 and lays out development goals for various sectors.
Shakeel Ramay, CEO of Islamabad-based Asian Institute of Eco-civilisation Research and Development, told a CEN reporter that one of the key areas of interest for foreign investors is the catalogue of encouraged foreign investment lists.
“China is moving well on this indicator, as the FI (foreign investment) list increased to 1,474 items (519 in the national catalogue and 955 in the regional catalogue), up 19% from 1,235 items (480 in the national catalogue and 755 in the regional catalogue) in the 2020 version,” he said.
“China is also opening the financial sector and allowing foreign enterprises to benefit from the financing opportunities,” he stressed. “The strength of the domestic market mechanisms to support the dual circulation model, vast network of economies under BRI and many other initiatives will continue to bolster its economy and the economy in the region,” he analysed. “A major driver of growth will be renewable energy and related industries and infrastructure.”

3,Legal issues hinder projects’ transfer,"Provinces reluctant to take over 357 schemes due to legal, contractual challenges","All provinces have opposed the transfer and closure of over 350 provincial projects costing Rs1,373 billion and are not willing to take over the schemes, citing legal and contractual issues.
The federal government believes that as the seventh National Finance Commission (NFC) Award has significantly increased provincial shares in the federal divisible pool, the provinces should complete their projects through their own resources. There are a total of 1,238 ongoing projects in financial year 2023-24 having a cost of Rs12,318 billion. Of these, 357 are provincial projects valuing at Rs1,373 billion.
The expenditure on all projects is calculated at Rs3,616 billion while the spending required for provincial projects is Rs366 billion.
Sources said that the issue of transferring the ongoing projects was taken up in a meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC) attended by provincial representatives.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa proposed that the decision on closure and transfer of projects should be made by the newly elected government. Sindh also opposed the closure and transfer of projects, except for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) programme. Punjab agreed with all the proposed modalities, with the caveat that taking over and completing the ongoing projects should be at the discretion of provincial governments.
It agreed to complete the schemes being executed by provincial agencies from their own resources. In a joint statement, all provinces said that legal and contractual issues would arise if the ongoing projects were closed or transferred, therefore they did not commit to taking over and completing the schemes.
The federal government undertakes development projects and programmes of national importance with the aim of spurring economic growth, ensuring equitable and balanced regional development and providing an enabling environment to the private sector and development partners.
NEC had approved on June 6, 2023 the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) 2023-24 worth Rs950 billion against the overall demand for Rs2,000 billion in development funds. Of the total projects, 30% fell within the jurisdiction of provinces and constituted 11% of the total cost. So far, 10% spending has been made on the projects.
The Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives told NEC that over the years the PSDP composition had been undergoing transformation.
One reason for that was the inclusion of projects and programmes pertaining to subjects that fell within the provincial domain subsequent to the 18th Amendment to the Constitution.
NEC was informed that allocations for such projects and programmes had risen to around 30% of the overall PSDP. As a consequence, the physical and financial progress of mega and core projects of federal subjects was being adversely affected due to the reduction in available funds for such projects and programmes.
It was emphasised that while the NFC Award significantly increased provincial share in the federal divisible pool, the federal debt servicing exceeded the entire tax revenue that remained available for the federal government after NFC share transfers to provinces.
Thus, the provinces had substantial resources to finance their respective Annual Development Plans (ADPs) whereas the federal PSDP was being financed mainly through borrowing.
NEC was informed that taking cognisance of the shrinking fiscal space of the federal government and to make resources available for critical needs, the apex committee of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) provided policy guidelines on financing for provincial-nature schemes.

4,Abu Dhabi-owned firm eyes growth,The company has reached a deal to buy both AvoAmerica Peru and Bomarea from US-based Solum Partners and Alpine Fresh,"Abu Dhabi-controlled fresh food producer Unifrutti is expanding its footprint in Latin America with two acquisitions in Peru, building on a previous purchase in the region as the firm eyes continued growth in the fruit market.
The company has reached a deal to buy both AvoAmerica Peru and Bomarea from US-based Solum Partners and Alpine Fresh, it said on Saturday, following its January acquisition of Verfrut, which produces fruits in Chile and Peru.
Unifrutti, which distributes 500,000 metric tons of fresh fruits worldwide per year, has been controlled by ADQ since 2022 as the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund focused on agriculture as a way to boost its financial gains and increase food resilience in the United Arab Emirates.
The newly acquired companies grow avocados and blueberries, both new markets for the company.

5,Customs unearths Rs1b tax fraud,Company imports tax-free raw material for sale in local market,"The Pakistan Customs Post Clearance Audit North has traced tax evasion worth more than Rs1 billion by a fake manufacturing unit.
A case has been registered against the tax evader, Khyber Fabrics Embroidery, after it was found that it only imported tax-free raw material for their sale rather than manufacturing value-added products.
Director PCA North Samiul Haq told The Express Tribune that Khyber Fabrics, bearing National Tax Number (NTN) 4451931-5, imported raw material worth Rs3.7 billion. Shipments were brought for its manufacturing concern.
However, instead of using the raw material for manufacturing value-added products for their supply to tribal areas, the firm sold the raw material comprising various types of fabrics in the local market.
The PCA director said that during a Customs clearance audit, it was discovered that Khyber Fabrics had been involved in misusing the tax incentives given to the erstwhile Fata and Pata.
The firm imported 4,063 metric tons of textile fabrics through 174 goods declarations worth Rs3.7 billion, including polyester tulle net, polyester organza, woven fabrics and printed and dyed fabrics, which were used in blankets.
Taking advantage of the tax incentives for tribal areas, the importer evaded sales tax of Rs720 million, additional sales tax of Rs126.2 million and income tax of Rs235.5 million, totalling a staggering sum of over Rs1 billion.
Haque said that during the raid at the manufacturing unit, it was revealed that textile mills located in Bara Bazar were actually a house which had two sewing machines and only four rolls of fabrics. He added that the importer was given ample opportunity to prove that those were legal transactions, but he failed to provide satisfactory answers.

6,"With political calm, PSX advances modestly","KSE-100 index rises 468 points, or 0.7% WoW, settles at 65,794","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) advanced somewhat and gained over 450 points during the outgoing week as political concerns eased following the formation of a new government and optimism grew about seeking a new, larger loan package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
With political clarity, Pakistan’s bonds rallied in the international market and also inflation came down to 23.1% in February from 28.3% a month ago. Those positive factors provided the required trigger to the stock market. However, weak data indicating a 19% year-on-year (YoY) decline in cement sales and an 8% decrease in oil consumption deterred investors.
In addition, the investors took a cautious stance due to uncertainty about economic recovery ahead of the monetary policy announcement in mid-March.
At the beginning of the week on Monday, the bourse marched north when investors took cue from the election of a new prime minister and the upbeat economic data.
Next day, stocks faced pressure from economic headwinds and lost over 200 points as market players were worried about the future course of the economy. On Wednesday too, the KSE-100 index remained under selling pressure because of doubts about potential negotiations with the IMF for a new loan programme of $6-8 billion.
The following day, stocks endured highly volatile trading and closed slightly lower owing to fears about economic recovery and the cautious stance ahead of monetary policy announcement. The index modestly rose by nearly 200 points on Friday where investors cheered the IMF’s willingness to negotiate a new programme to help Pakistan address its economic woes.
Overall, the benchmark KSE-100 index rose 468 points, or 0.7% week-on-week (WoW), and settled at 65,793.76.
JS Research analyst Muhammad Waqas Ghani, in his report, stated that the market gained ground and average traded volumes went up 1.6% during the week.
He said the bourse reacted positively to the settling of dust on the political front after Shehbaz Sharif was elected the prime minister for a second time. He gave the directive to immediately engage with the IMF for getting an Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
Names of new cabinet members were being finalised whereas the election for the country’s president was scheduled for March 9, to be followed by Senate elections later in the month.
Besides, Pakistan’s international bonds rallied on Monday on the back of clarity on the political front following weeks of uncertainty due to a hung parliament.
On the economic front, the pace of inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) slowed down to 23.1% in February, the lowest since July 2022 owing to a high base.
He pointed out that the YoY pace of Wholesale Price Index (WPI) eased to 18.7%, a 30-month low, while core inflation recorded a similar trend where urban and rural core inflation decreased to 15.5% (13-month low) and 21.9% (12-month low), respectively. On the back of lower inflation, the Karachi Inter-bank Offered Rate (Kibor) showed a continuous downward trend. Six-month Kibor dropped 37 basis points since close last Friday.
Meanwhile, Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s banking sector outlook from negative to stable, the JS analyst added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) wrote that the market continued its bullish momentum during the week amid revival of investors’ confidence on the back of formation of the new government. On the economic front, the government raised Rs527 billion through the auction of Market Treasury Bills.
Furthermore, textile exports climbed 20% YoY in February 2024, reaching $1.4 billion, while remittances increased 18% YoY to $2.25 billion. In addition, the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) reserves fell $54 million to $7.9 billion. Pakistani rupee closed at 279.04 against the US dollar, appreciating Rs0.15, or 0.05% WoW.
Sectors making positive contribution to the market were oil and gas exploration (217 points), refinery (105 points), fertiliser (76 points), power generation and distribution (61 points) and cement (61 points).
Foreign buying continued during the week under review, which came in at $6.3 million compared to net buying of $10.4 million last week, AHL added.

7,Cnergyico likely to ink plant upgrade deal soon,"Anticipated investment of $1b will boost petrol, diesel output","Cnergyico PK, formerly known as Byco Petroleum, the largest oil refinery in Pakistan, has announced that it may sign a “final agreement” with the government soon to upgrade its both refineries under the amended Pakistan Oil Refining Policy for Up-gradation of Existing/ Brownfield Refineries, 2023.
Talking to The Express Tribune, an official involved in the process of upgrading the refinery said “Cnergyico has not yet signed the final agreement…but expects to ink the deal soon with the government.” “The company is all set … to do everything to upgrade its plants,” he said.
The upgrade will allow the refinery to significantly reduce the production of outdated product ie, furnace oil and boost output of high-profit-margin and premium products like petrol and diesel. This will result in a significant fall in imports of expensive refined products and save foreign exchange.
The refinery, having total installed capacity of processing 156,000 barrels per day of crude oil into refined products, reported to Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday “the anticipated investment by the company is set to exceed $1 billion (for the upgrade).”
“However, precise cost estimates will be established post Front-end Engineering Design (FEED) of the upgrade project,” the notification read.
FEED is the basic engineering work done at the completion of the conceptual design or feasibility study. This is the pre-EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) stage.
According to the official, the newly amended policy gives a five-year time to complete the upgrade since the inking of the final agreement. “Cnergyico will complete the process within the stipulated time frame,” he said.
The source said the policy gave six-month time for achieving financial close (arranging full financing) and expected the company to meet the goal within the given time frame.
He pointed out that the refinery was using a mix of light and heavy crude to reduce the production of furnace oil. Despite this, it is still producing a significant quantity of fuel oil.
Rough estimates suggest the refinery is producing 40-45% furnace oil from crude processing. The heavy crude carries a higher amount of furnace oil compared to the lighter one. Until a few years ago, furnace oil was being heavily utilised in electricity generation. However, the setting up of new, cheaper power plants forced the government to phase out the oil-run plants.
Besides, the UN maritime agency also banned the use of high sulphur-containing furnace oil in sea transportation from January 2020. “Furnace oil is being sold at a price lower than that for crude oil,” an industry official said the other day. Some of the refineries are exporting furnace oil to get rid of the unnecessary product. Plant upgrades under new technology will help convert furnace oil into petrol and diesel.
Cnergyico PK, in its notification, said it had already committed to upgrading its both refineries during 2020 and 2021 to manufacture Euro-V standard gasoline (petrol) and diesel, while concurrently reducing fuel oil production. It said the government had recently approved amendments, after consultation with all refineries, to the Pakistan Oil Refining Policy for Up-gradation of Existing/ Brownfield Refineries, 2023.
The policy will bring an investment of approximately $5-6 billion in the refining sector in Pakistan. Earlier, Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL) announced that it had launched the plant upgrade project with an estimated investment of $1.7 billion under the amended policy.
The company aims to double its installed processing capacity to 100,000 barrels per day from 50,000 barrels. It is expected to complete the project by the end of 2028, according to PRL officials.
Arif Habib Limited, a local research house, said recently “ATRL (Attock Refinery Limited) will reach a refinery upgrade agreement soon.” “Our expectations stem from ATRL having the strongest balance sheet in the refinery sector and massive cash position of Rs66 billion (Rs616 per share) with no debt,” it said. At present, Pakistan has five oil refineries including Pak-Arab Refinery (Parco), Attock Refinery, National Refinery, PRL and Cnergyico PK.

8,European firms oppose LNG permit extension,Believe Venture Global LNG has completed plant but has failed to provide cargoes,"Top European energy companies on Friday asked US regulators to reject Venture Global LNG’s request for a one-year construction permit extension to its Louisiana export plant.
Shell, Italian utility Edison, Repsol, Orlen, and Galp Energia oppose the request because they believe Venture Global LNG has completed its plant but has failed to give them contracted cargoes.
Venture Global last month asked for a one-year extension to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) permit to complete its Calcasieu Pass plant, or to receive assurances it did not need an extension.
“Shell LNG respectfully requests that the Commission find the extension request, in its conditional form, to be moot and summarily deny it,” the company said.
Edison asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to compel Venture Global to release commissioning documents to justify the extension request.
Repsol and Galp told federal regulators they cannot participate fully in the 15-day intervention period because of their lack of access to commissioning documents.
The European companies say they contracted with Venture Global LNG but have not got their gas cargoes under long-term contracts. Venture Global LNG has been selling gas from the plant for more than a year to others, costing them billions in lost profit.
Venture Global LNG on Friday asked the regulatory commission to “reject the myriad claims of BP, Shell and Orlen.”

9,Govt mulls help to expand tax base,Will approach Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to seek financial assistance,"As the number of active taxpayers further shrinks to 3.4 million, down 41% over the previous year, the government is considering seeking financial assistance from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to improve digital services in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
Compared to a week ago, the names of about 500,000 people were omitted from the Active Taxpayers List (ATL) for tax year 2023 due to their inability to timely submit the annual income tax returns. These people will have to pay a nominal penalty for inclusion in the list. The designated new economic czar, Muhammad Aurangzeb, on Friday chaired his first meeting to discuss the possibilities of improving digital services to broaden the tax base, according to the government officials.
The meeting was also attended by Karandaaz Pakistan, a firm engaged in financial inclusion services and having expertise in providing digital platforms with the assistance of foreign donors. It was decided that Karandaaz would approach the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to seek financial assistance for building a digital platform in the FBR, confirmed two participants of the meeting.
The government is planning to minimise interaction between taxmen and taxpayers to increase transparency and reduce opportunities of corruption.
The development came as the number of active taxpayers further fell to a mere 3.4 million, according to the Active Taxpayers List published by the FBR this week.
According to last year’s list, the active taxpayers were over 5.7 million. This suggests a reduction of over 2.32 million, or 41%, in the tax base, which is alarming.
The FBR received 3.9 million income tax returns but about 500,000 did not file returns within the given time frame. Thus, their names were deleted from the active list, according to an FBR official.
As a result, the number of people who are entitled to the reduced income tax rates is just 3.4 million. Those who are not on the active taxpayers list would have to pay 0.6% withholding tax on cash withdrawal.
These roughly 500,000 people can again become active filers by paying a fine of just Rs1,000 for late filing of returns.
The government is going to face pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to broaden the tax base and reduce the number of tax slabs for salaried and business individuals.
Fresh data showed that tax contribution from the salaried class peaked at Rs217 billion in eight months (Jul-Feb) of the current fiscal year. Taxes paid by the salaried individuals were Rs37 billion, or one-fifth, more than the combined taxes paid by the rich exporters and real estate players.
Read: FBR detects over Rs8.5m tax evasion
Like other citizens, the salaried persons are also paying taxes on the use of services like digital payments through debit and credit cards and the use of internet, mobile and telephone services.
The FBR got Rs12.7 billion on overseas payments made through debit and credit cards, a sum that was 429% higher than the same period of last fiscal year.
Two days ago, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif supported the proposal to reduce tax slabs that would further increase the burden on salaried persons.
Speaking to newly elected members of the National Assembly on Thursday, the PM supported the idea of reducing the number of tax slabs.
The Express Tribune reported in December last year that the IMF had asked Pakistan to cut the number of tax slabs for the salaried and business class from the existing seven to four.
At present, income tax rates for the salaried class range from the low of 2.5% to the high of 35%, depending on the annual income. In case of deleting two or three tax slabs, the tax rates for people earning from Rs200,000 to Rs300,000 a month would increase sharply.
FBR officials said that the maximum tax was collected from people earning Rs200,000 to Rs300,000 a month.
There is no tax on the monthly income of up to Rs50,000. But on the income of Rs100,000, there is a tax of 2.5%. On the monthly income of Rs200,000, the rate increases to 12.5%. For the income of Rs300,000, the tax rate is 22.5% and for Rs500,000, the rate jumps to 27.5%. For the highest slab of over Rs500,000, the rate is 35%.
Details showed that the salaried class again remained the fourth-largest income tax contributor during the first eight months of the current fiscal year. It paid Rs217 billion in taxes, which was Rs62 billion, or 40%, higher than the same period of last year.
The additional tax that the salaried class paid was slightly higher than the total tax of Rs61.3 billion paid by the rich exporters. In the budget, the government, for the second time in one year, increased taxes on the salaried people earning more than Rs200,000 a month.
PM Shehbaz is considering increasing the tax burden further at a time when inflation is already at high levels due to a massive increase in prices of electricity, gas, heating and food.
Exporters paid only Rs61.3 billion in taxes during eight months, which was 255% less than the tax contribution by the salaried persons. The IMF is also wrongly putting more burden on the salaried class, which, unlike exporters and retailers, does not have a voice in power corridors.
Tax collection from contractors and service providers jumped 32% to Rs309 billion in eight months, the second highest contribution. The collection on account of profit on debt jumped 49% to Rs312 billion, the highest payment on the income tax side. Importers paid Rs256 billion in income tax on various types of imports, the third-largest contributor to withholding taxes.
