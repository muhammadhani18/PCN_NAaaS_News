He said empowered provinces are the basis of a strong federation and after the abolition of the concurrent list of the Constitution, the federal ministries which are to be transferred to the provinces should be handed over to them.

4,Dates business thrives in Sindh as Ramazan approaches,Surge in date sales underscores cultural significance and nutritional value of this fruit in holy month of Ramazan,"The business of selling dates ahead of Ramazan is touching its peaks across Sindh with a number of vendors and stalls have been set up.
While a number of shop owners command a substantial portion of the market, sales from small vendors are also witnessing a notable spike.
A small-scale vendor, Zulfiqar Ali Memon, highlighted the lucrative nature of the trade during the month of Ramazan, stating that while he typically sells dates worth Rs20,000 in other months, his earnings soar to around Rs150,000 in the holy month.
Ghareebabad Small Traders' Association President, Lala Abid Khokhar, affirmed the surge in trading activity, noting that both wholesalers and retailers rush to procure dates before Ramazan, resulting in an increase of business by over 100 per cent.
Sukkur Chamber of Commerce and Industries (SCCI) former president, Amir Ghouri acknowledged the heightened trading activity this year but lamented the manifold increase in date prices.
A vendor, Abdullah Pathan, emphasised the diverse range of dates sourced from countries including Iran and Afghanistan, catering to the high demand for these nutritious dry fruits.
A nutritionist, Dr Najia Mughal, underscored the myriad health benefits of dates, advocating for their consumption in various forms such as blending the paste with milk, yogurt, or incorporating them into bread or butter for added flavour.
Dr Mughal further elaborated on the advantages of breaking fast with dates, citing their ability to curb overeating post-fast due to their high nutritional value. 
Renowned for their sweetness and versatility, dates are lauded for their digestive-regulating properties and ability to boost energy levels shortly after consumption.
The surge in date sales not only signifies economic prosperity but also underscores the cultural significance and nutritional value of this fruit during the holy month of Ramazan.
