8,Naqvi getting cabinet post turns thorny,Dar also not in good books of PM Shehbaz,"The process of forming a federal cabinet has turned thorny as the selection of names for various cabinet posts becomes a contentious issue.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, a senior PML-N leader, who is on track to become a federal minister, denied any first-hand knowledge of ministry assignments. Contrary to media speculation, the leader asserted that he had not been part of any meetings discussing ministry allotments.
Addressing the possibility of Mohsin Naqvi's appointment as the interior minister, either as an adviser or special assistant to the PM, the PML-N leader said it would be nothing short of a joke.
He said that Naqvi's accession would erode the government's credibility, already on shaky ground.
Meanwhile, a well-placed source within the PML-N revealed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, dissatisfied with Ishaq Dar's performance as finance minister in his previous term, opted to work with someone of his choosing. He denied rumours of any pressure from Rawalpindi in this regard.
Ishaq Dar, brought back from London in September 2022 to elbow out the then finance minister Miftah Ismail, faced the challenge of steering the economy out of crisis – a decision largely stemming from the poor decision-making of the then PM Shehbaz's government.
However, his tenure saw a downturn in the country's economy, resulting in a loss of public support for the PML-N.
The economy experienced a downward trajectory during his tenure as finance minister, and the damage inflicted was not confined to the country’s economy alone. The PML-N's reputation as an effective troubleshooter also crumbled in the aftermath of 16 months of financial mismanagement, leading to a loss of public support.
Despite the setbacks, PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif continued to shower his praises on his relative Dar – also his relative – crediting him and his younger brother Shehbaz for saving the country from the brink of default.
Speculation also arose regarding the establishment's dissatisfaction with PML-N's performance in its last term.
A sitting provincial minister and PML-N leader, speaking on the condition of anonymity, hinted that Shehbaz Sharif's preference for a new finance minister led to Dar not being chosen for the slot.
The source denied any pressure from the establishment in this regard but subtly suggested that Ata Tarar's position as information minister may have had input from powerful quarters.
The minister, however, declined to comment on Mohsin Naqvi's potential appointment to the interior ministry, saying he was personally opposed but said it would have a potential negative impact on the government's image if it materialises.

9,Vawda censures newly elected govt,The former senator questioned why elections were not held in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa last year,"Former senator Faisal Vawda on Saturday issued a sharp rebuke against the newly elected government, denouncing it as a “manifestation of nepotism”.
“You are seeing more ‘funerals of democracy in this nepotism’,” he said while talking to a private news channel.
Censuring the new representatives, the former senator questioned why elections were not held in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa last year, in violation of the law and Constitution, after the dissolution of both assemblies in these provinces. “What are the champions of Constitution and law doing here?” he asked.
Vawda said “this failed and incompetent government” could not control prices of essential commodities during Ramazan and was not capable of providing relief to the common man. “So how will this incompetent government perform in future?”
He further questioned who had suspended the sentences of both the sons of Nawaz Sharif.
He said rigging in 2018 elections was carried out in an “artistic, organized and classic manner” whereas this time it was done in a “blatant” style.
