0,Ruet-e-Hilal committee to meet tomorrow for Ramazan moon,Meeting to be chaired by Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad in Peshawar,"The Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee is set to meet tomorrow for the sighting of Ramazan moon in Peshawar, after evening prayers.
According to the statement issued by the spokesperson, the meeting for the sighting of the Ramazan moon - for Hijri year 1445 - will be administered by Chairman Ruet-e-Hilal committee Maulana Abdul Khabir.
Meanwhile, the meetings of other zonal and district Ruet-e-Hilal committees will be held simultaneously at their respective locations. The final announcement regarding the moon will be made by the chairman himself, based on testimonies received from different parts of the country.
The meteorological department has already predicted the sighting of the Ramazan moon on March 11.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have asked their citizens to look for the Ramazan moon on March 10. This hints that these countries will potentially start Ramazan a day earlier than Pakistan - which is usually the case.
The sacred month, marked by devout dedication, will witness millions of Pakistanis and billions of Muslims globally engaging in fasting from sunrise to sunset, with the duration of fasting spanning between 12 to 17 hours - contingent on geographical locations worldwide.

1,Pope says Ukraine should have 'courage of the white flag' of negotiations,"""Do not be ashamed of negotiating, before things get worse,"" said Francis","Pope Francis has said in an interview that Ukraine should have what he called the courage of the ""white flag"" and negotiate an end to the war with Russia that followed Moscow's full-scale invasion two years ago and that has killed tens of thousands.
Francis made his comments in an interview recorded last month with Swiss broadcaster RSI, well before Friday's latest offer by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to host a summit between Ukraine and Russia to end the war.
Erdogan made the fresh offer after a meeting in Istanbul with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy has said while he wants peace he will not give up any territory.
The Ukrainian leader's own peace plan calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops from all of Ukraine and the restoration of its state borders. The Kremlin has ruled out engaging in peace talks on terms set by Kyiv.
A spokesman for Zelenskiy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the pope's remarks.
In the interview Francis was asked for his position on a debate between those who say Ukraine should give up as it has not been able to repel Russian forces, and those who say doing so would legitimise actions by the strongest party. The interviewer used the term ""white flag"" in the question.
""It is one interpretation, that is true,"" Francis said, according to an advance transcript of the interview and a partial video made available to Reuters on Saturday. It is due to be broadcast on March 20 as part of a new cultural programme.
""But I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the courage of the white flag, and negotiates,"" Francis said, adding that talks should take place with the help of international powers.
""The word negotiate is a courageous word. When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate,"" Francis said.
It was believed to be the first time Francis has used terms such as ""white flag"" or ""defeated"" in discussing the Ukraine war, although he has spoken in the past about the need for negotiations.
In a statement, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the pope had picked up on the term ""white flag"" spoken by the interviewer and used it ""to indicate a stop to hostilities (and) a truce achieved with the courage of negotiations"".
Last year the 87-year-old pope sent a peace envoy, Italian Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, to Kyiv, Moscow and Washington to sound out leaders in those countries.
""One may feel shame,"" Francis said about negotiating, ""but how many dead will it (the war) end up with? (One should) negotiate in time, find a country that can be a mediator,"" Francis said, mentioning Turkey among the countries that had offered.
""Do not be ashamed of negotiating, before things get worse,"" said Francis, who has made hundreds of appeals for what he calls ""martyred Ukraine"". Asked if he was willing to mediate, Francis said ""I am here"".
In another part of the interview, speaking of the war between Israel and Hamas, Francis said: ""Negotiating is never a surrender"".
Last month Zelenskiy said that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the Russian invasion in February 2022 and that tens of thousands of civilians had been killed in the occupied areas of the country.

3,How Zardari outsmarted judicial system,"Zardari is a man of many parts, he is a constitutional reformer who empowered parliament and the federating units","Despite all efforts by the superior judiciary and powerful circles, newly elected President Asif Ali Zardari has always managed to avoid conviction in graft cases throughout his political career.
""I literally wear out judicial proceedings,"" said Zardari in an interview on a private TV channel a couple of years ago.
Former additional attorney general Tariq Mahmood Khokhar said Zardari epitomizes his wife Benazir Bhutto’s legacy of vengeance for democracy.
“Zardari is a man of many parts: He is a constitutional reformer who empowered parliament and the federating units, led the PPP out of political wilderness, and steered it into mainstream politics.
“He is a past master in the art of the possible, with deep insight into the politics of Pakistan, and a sustainer of the Bhutto dynasty, albeit through other means,"" he said.
Zardari has remained imprisoned for 11 years at different times. He was in jail even during the PML-N’s second rule in 1997.
The PML-N government led by Nawaz Sharif had written to the Swiss authorities and asked them to investigate allegations of corruption against various individuals including Zardari.
Subsequently, several accountability cases were instituted against the PPP leader. None of those cases ever reached finality.
In 1999, Zardari was convicted in the SGS-Cotecna case by a bench of the Lahore High Court headed by Justice Malik Muhammad Qayyum.
However, Justice Qayyum was later found to have privately discussed these cases with various members of the Nawaz Sharif government and the Supreme Court rightly set the conviction aside.
During the era of General Pervez Musharraf, Zardari remained in jail.
In 2004, he was released on bail after spending eight years in jail without ever getting convicted.
In 2007, Musharraf promulgated the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) in order to close graft cases of political leaders.
Subsequently, in 2008, Asif Ali Zardari became the president of Pakistan. The PPP-led government was then reluctant to restore former chief justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry.
After the lawyers’ agitation, Justice Chaudhry was restored in March 2009. However, the PPP government was not given credit for the restoration of judges.
Later, the Supreme Court led by CJ Chaudhry on December 16, 2009 declared the NRO as unconstitutional.
Meanwhile, a bench was constituted for implementing the NRO judgment in which the federal government was directed to write a letter to the Swiss authorities regarding the reopening of cases against Zardari.
However, the PPP government contended that the president enjoyed immunity and a letter could not be written to the Swiss authorities.
Later, a larger bench even convicted the then prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, in a contempt case. The same bench also issued contempt notice to the next PM Raja Pervez Ashraf.
Finally, the PPP government wrote a letter to the Swiss authorities but the communication did not have any effect.
Both the PPP government and Zardari faced tough times during Justice Chaudhry’s tenure. However, despite all efforts, Zardari remained secure.
Former CJ Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry had also constituted a commission to probe the scandal with regard to the writing of a controversial memo to the US government during the PPP’s rule.
The inquiry commission led by Justice Qazi Faez Isa had later held that it could not be established that Pakistan's former ambassador to the US Hussain Haqani wrote the memo to US authorities on the instruction of Zardari.
Asif Ali Zardari also faced a tough time during the PML-N’s third government between 2013 and 2018.
Firstly, the then interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar, initiated an inquiry into alleged money laundering by the PPP leader through fake bank accounts.
Later, former CJ Mian Saqib Nisar took suo motu notice of the scandal and constituted a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to probe the fake accounts allegations.
After the submission of the JIT report, a bench led by Justice Nisar referred all graft cases filed against Zardari and his close aides to an accountability court in Islamabad.
Serious reservations were expressed by PPP lawyers over the transfer of cases from Karachi to Islamabad court.
The review petitions filed by Zardari and others were also rejected by the SC led by former CJP Asif Saeed Khosa.
During the PTI’s rule, Zardari and his sister, Faryal Talpur, were sent to jail in the fake accounts cases. After spending months in jail, they got bail on medical grounds.
Accountability courts also expedited proceedings in the cases. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had nominated Zardari in five references in which charges were framed during the PTI’s rule.
However, the proceedings in those cases were stopped after the ouster of the PTI led federal government in April 2022.
When Shehbaz Sharif became the prime minister, the PML-N led coalition government made amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999. Those amendments favored Zardari.
Subsequently, Imran Khan challenged the amendments in the NAO, 1999 in the Supreme Court.
The SC by a majority vote of 2 to 1 struck down the amendments made to the NAB law.
In view of the majority opinion, graft cases against Zardari were restored. Later the federal government filed an intra-court appeal (ICAs) against the judgment.
A larger bench led by incumbent CJ Qazi Faez Isa is hearing the government's appeal against the judgment.
The bench has halted the accountability courts to give final decisions in the cases until the court’s decision in this matter.
Now newly elected President Asif Ali Zardari will enjoy complete immunity in criminal cases for the next five years.
Credit also goes to Zardari's counsel Farooq H Naek who delayed the trials through different tactics.
In the Toshakhana case, Imran Khan was convicted in a couple of months while Nawaz Sharif was also convicted in the Panama case.
However, Zardari has always managed to evade conviction.

4,Zardari’s sworn in for unprecedented second term,CJ Faez Isa administers oath at an impressive ceremony in Aiwan-e-Sadr,"Asif Ali Zardari took oath as the 14th president of Pakistan at an impressive ceremony at the Aiwan-e-Sadr on Sunday, becoming the first leader to take the highest office of the country twice.
Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa administered the oath to Zardari, the president of the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP), who replaced Dr Arif Alvi of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). The PPPP is a major partner in the ruling coalition government.
The ceremony was attended by the outgoing president, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, top military leadership, governors, chief ministers, National Assembly speaker, parliamentarians, political leaders, diplomats and media persons.
The hall, where the oath ceremony took place, was packed with guests. The supporters of the PPPP often raised slogans in favour of Zardari and the party. They also raised slogans in favour of the army, when Army Chief Gen Asim Munir entered the hall.
Upon arriving for the ceremony, Gen Asim went to the children of Zardari, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Bakhtawar and Aseefa. As a traditional and cultural way of greeting, Gen Aism placed his hand on the heads of both Bakhtawar and Aseefa and shook hands with Bilawal.
Gen Asim also shook hands with former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who was seated in the front row. Lt-Gen Nadeem Anjum, who was also present at the ceremony, met with Nawaz. Former Punjab caretaker chief minister Mohsin Naqvi also walked to Nawaz and inquired after his health.
The ceremony had a special guest, the grandson of Zardari. Besides, ambassadors and high commissioners of more than 70 countries, including the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirate (UAE), also participated in the ceremony.
Zardari, the candidate for the ruling coalition led by Shahbaz’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), had previously served as president during 2008-13.He was elected for the constitutional office on Saturday by the presidential electoral college, comprising parliament and provincial assemblies.
Although the president’s office has a ceremonial status since the 18th Constitutional Amendment, also introduced by Zardari during his first term, the peculiar formation of the current coalition government gives the 68-year-old PPPP leader an advantage.

5,Two terrorists slain by their own explosives in Peshawar,Third one critically injured; blast occurred before they could reach their target,"Two terrorists were killed and a third one suffered severe injuries on Sunday when the explosives they were transporting went off in Peshawar.
Their bodies and the injured terrorist were shifted to a hospital.
A heavy contingent of police later surrounded the area of the blast, and initiated a search operation.
However, nobody had been arrested by the time this report was filed.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sardar Ali Amin Gandapur condemned the blast and sought a report from the provincial police chief.
Speaking to the media, Senior Superintendent of Police (Operations) Kashif Aftab Abbasi said that four to five kilogrammes of explosives were used in the blast, but it was too early to say who the target was.
“We are investigating [the case].”
Elaborating further, the official said the three terrorists were riding a motorcycle.
“According to the bomb disposal unit report, the blast was not a suicide attack but occurred during the transfer of explosives.”
The SSP said according to the investigation team, no civilian was martyred in the blast, but the terrorists riding the motorcycle became victims to the explosives themselves.
He continued that before the terrorist could reach their target, the explosives went off killing two of them.
The third terrorist, who was injured in the blast, had been identified as Usman, aged between 28 and 30 years.
The police official said the motorcycle was completely destroyed in the explosion. He added that the scope of investigation would be expanded by retrieving its engine and chassis numbers.
According to Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) officials, the two slain terrorists have been identified as Sulaiman and Amir. They added that one of them was a would-be suicide bomber who belonged to Dir district and currently residing in Peshawar.
The officials said Usman was in a serious condition right now and would be interrogated as soon as he regained consciousness.
They continued that the three men were wanted by the CTD. Mobile phones and other items have been recovered from their possession.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq condemned the incident in Peshawar and thanked the Almighty that the nation was spared from a great loss.
The premier in his statement said the police and security forces had always stood like a wall against terrorism.
“They [the police and security forces] are determined to eradicate terrorism from the roots,” he added.
PM Shehbaz has sought a report from the K-P police chief on the incident.

6,PM ups Ramzan relief package by Rs5b,Premier Shehbaz takes it to Rs12.5b from Rs7.5b," 
Amid the people reeling under the pressure of the spiralling inflation, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has increased the Ramazan relief package by Rs5 billion – taking it to Rs12.5 billion from Rs7.5 billion, a statement issued by the PM’s Media Wing Office on Sunday read.
According to the statement, the premier has also ordered to enhance its outreach in the country to facilitate the people during the holy month.
Along with utility stores and the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), mobile units will also provide food items at comparatively lower prices.
PM Shehbaz has directed the authorities concerned that the Ramazan relief package should be delivered to as many poor, indigent and deserving people as possible.
Initially, 1,200 mobile points and 300 permanent package relief centres are being established.
Throughout the holy month of Ramazan, food items will be provided at prices lower than those in the normal market under the relief package.
Apart from the designated places, trucks will also deliver food items at subsided rate to the poor people in different areas using GPS. A special video will also be released to guide the use of the mobile app.
A digital technology powered dashboard is being developed to monitor mobile flour sales.
The supply of flour will continue during the transfer of mobile units from one location to another.
Flour distribution will be continuously monitored by mobile and live footage.
On March 7, PM Shehbaz had announced a Rs7.5 billion Ramazan relief package.
A total of 39.6 million people would be provided food items during Ramazan at prices reduced by 30%.
Under the BISP, various food items including flour, rice, lentils, ghee, sugar, syrup and milk would be sold at cheaper rates.
The subsidy on flour would be Rs77 per kg and on ghee Rs100 per kg.
Last year, the caretaker government had allocated around Rs5 billion for the Ramazan relief package that was available to both targeted and general consumers.
An amount of Rs1.15 billion was allocated for subsidies to targeted consumers — those registered with the BISP. Meanwhile, a sum of Rs3.84 billion was reserved for providing essential goods at discounted rates to the general consumers.
The subsidy was available on selected goods including vegetables, ghee, tea, flour, sugar, milk, beverages, dates and gram flour at utility stores across the country.
The number of subsidised items was increased to 19 including flour, ghee, sugar, cooking oil, tea, dates, dal maash, dal moong, milk, drinks, and spices.
To targeted consumers, a 10-kg bag of flour was available at Rs400, sugar at Rs70 per kg, and ghee at Rs300 per kg. The general consumers could buy a 10-kg bag of flour for Rs648, sugar for Rs91 per kg and ghee for Rs490 per kg.
