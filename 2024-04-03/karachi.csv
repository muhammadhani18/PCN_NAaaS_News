Petitioner Ali Ahmed Palh, who is the general secretary of the PTI-Sindh, submitted that his party had approached the district and provincial administration on a number of occasions for permission or no-objection certificate (NOC) in this regard, but to no avail.
Citing the chief secretary, Karachi commissioner and deputy commissioner-East as respondents, the petitioner contended that following the change of government, the PTI and its leadership were facing numerous challenges, including registration of cases and restriction on freedom of speech and assembly as well as a systematic effort to curtail the influence of the party.
He further submitted that initially, an application was filed with the DC concerned on March 21, seeking permission to hold a public meeting on April 21, at a ground adjacent to Mazar-i-Quaid from 4pm to midnight and proper access for people to the venue without any hindrance.
The petitioner also submitted that he had a detailed meeting with the DC regarding the process and timely permission and the deputy commissioner had agreed upon the venue and timing of such public gathering.
However, he maintained that since the DC had not granted the NOC, the petitioner moved another identical application on March 27, but no response was forthcoming.
Thereafter, the petitioner contended that they were forced to change the intended date by a week (April 28) and approached the chief secretary and commissioner, but they also remained unable to make a decision on the subject matter.
The lawyer for the petitioner, Ali Tahir, argued that the petitioner and his party were entitled to the protection of Articles 16 and 17 and had the right to assemble peacefully and sought directive for respondents to decide these applications.
The counsel also asked the SHC that in case of refusal by the respondents, the same decision may be set aside and directives be issued to them to grant permission for a public meeting on April 28.

5,Experts paint bleak picture of human rights situation in country,Moot calls on state to put an end to enforced disappearances,"KARACHI: Speakers at a seminar on Tuesday observed that the situation of human rights and freedom of the press was deteriorating in the country in the wake of growing intolerance and extremism.
They also expressed concern over the security situation in Balochistan, where they said enforced disappearances had become very common but no one was doing anything to address the worsening crisis.
They were speaking at a seminar — Status of Human Rights in Pakistan: Challenges and Way Forward — organised by the Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology (Szabist) here on Tuesday.
Speaking on the occasion, Human Rights Commission Pakistan (HRCP) chairman Asad Iqbal Butt said intolerance was constantly increasing in society, with minorities were facing problems in getting jobs and their places of worship facing threats and attacks. 

Moot calls on state to put an end to enforced disappearances 

Similarly, he said, the people took law into their hands and killed anyone by charging him or her with blasphemy but the state appeared ‘helpless’ and unable to do anything.
“This behaviour of the state encourages the elements involved in such crimes,” he said.
He was of the view that one of the main reasons behind interlace and extremism in Pakistan was All India Muslims League’s narrative of religion when it was fighting for independence.
The HRCP chairman believed that by declaring Pakistan an ‘Islamic republic’ the state meant that besides Muslims, other citizens had no or inferior place in the country.
Speaking about Balochistan, Mr Butt said that people in the province were being picked up by law enforcers for decades. 
He said the state complained that the people of Balochistan did not trust it. “Why would they trust the state when the state itself has done things to lose their trust,” he asked.
Giving a recent example, he continued: “Recently, many Baloch women came to Islamabad to protest because they believed in the Constitution but they [state authorities] did not talk to them. Rather, they did things to disturb them and force them to end their protest.”
And when anyone returned after ‘disappearance’, the courts never asked where that person had been and never charged those who were responsible for the violation of human rights, he added.
Dr Riaz Sheikh, the dean of the Szabist’s social sciences faculty, also spoke on the issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan.
He said: “The state is supposed to guarantee the lives and safety of people but in this country, the state itself is involved in the disappearance of people.”
Academic and author Dr Tauseef Ahmed Khan talked about media freedom in Pakistan and its issues.
He said that the narrative of the media was being controlled for the past many years. “Article 19 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech but it was changed and the judiciary, armed forces and another department were exempted from it. So you cannot speak against them.”
He said the media in the country had not been free in the past and was not even at present. Some restrictions were imposed on the media in the past and still continue to be in practice, he said. “For instance, whatever happens in Balochistan, the media cannot speak on it.”
Referring to the violation of basic human rights, particularly in Sindh, journalist and human rights activist Husain Naqi said he had been in Karachi for the last around four weeks and so many people had been killed in that time. He said there had been dozens of cases of not only girls but even babies being raped in the province.
He said that incidents of enforced disappearance should be stopped or there should be a mobilisation of the masses to fight against lawbreakers.
As the way forward, the HRCP chief said it was necessary to promote a democratic culture along with regular discussions and dialogue on such issues. 
He said similar things in all religions in the country should also be promoted to build tolerance among people.

6,SPLA voices concern over holding of intermediate exams in peak summer,KARACHI: The Sindh Professors and Lecturers Association (SPLA) on Tuesday asked the provincial government to review...,"KARACHI: The Sindh Professors and Lecturers Association (SPLA) on Tuesday asked the provincial government to review the decision of holding intermediate exams during the peak summer season.
“Have some mercy on the students who will be sitting for their exams in extreme heat in inadequate facilities, which will also have an effect on their examination results,” the association said in a statement.
SPLA president Munawwar Abbas and other leaders appealed to Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah and Secretary Colleges Sadaf Anis to take notice and issue orders to hold the exams in the last week of April or at the most in the first week of May.
The SPLA said its leadership had repeatedly conveyed their message to the higher authorities that the annual intermediate examinations should be held in moderate weather instead of in extreme heat.
They said that they had also provided suggestions that the annual intermediate examinations should be held in late April because the weather was very hot in the month of May. “Still the steering committee has decided to take exams in the last week of May which we reject,” the statement said.
The SPLA leaders further said that starting the exams at the end of May would mean that the exams would be ended in the hot months of June and July. 
They expressed regret over this action and said that last year’s decision to conduct the exam in the hot summer season resulted in the death of a student in Khairpur during the exam.
The SPLA leaders said that the authorities should leave their air-conditioned offices to spend just one hour in any examination hall at a centre, especially in the afternoon shift, amid loadshedding and extreme heat. 
Only then they would know taking the exam in such situations was itself a big test, they added. 
They also pointed out that June and July are also the time from summer vacations, so the availability of college teachers at examination centres after May 31 will be affected and no teacher can be forced to sacrifice their vacations.
The SPLA leaders also said that the Department of College Education has also issued a letter from them to the Sindh School Education Department to be included in the steering committee though SPLA has not been made a part of the steering committee, which is regrettable.

7,SHC dismisses petition against entrance fee at Quaid’s mausoleum,Bench warns petitioner against filing such frivolous pleas in future,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) has dismissed a petition seeking abolishing entrance fee for the visitors to the mausoleum of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
Headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, the two-judge bench observed that prima facie the respondents had the authority to charge reasonable entrance fee as well as parking fee in accordance with relevant law and decision of the Mazar management board.
It also said the petitioner, being a public servant or an employee of a corporation, must give top priority to his work/duty instead of approaching the SHC by filing frivolous petitions. The bench warned the petitioner to be careful in future by not filing such type of petitions, otherwise, the same would be dismissed with heavy costs.
At the outset of the hearing, a federal law officer informed the bench that the petitioner was an employee of the PTCL and habitual of filing petitions under the garb of public interest litigations.

Bench warns petitioner against filing such frivolous pleas in future

The bench in its order noted that prima facie the petition had been filed without having any knowledge about Section 5 of the Quaid-i-Azam Mazar (Protection and Maintenance) Ordinance, 1971 which authorised the respondents to maintain the Mazar.
“The other provisions of the Ordinance also reflect that since it is the responsibility to maintain the Mazar and also to ensure the law and order situation and regulate the entry of the visitors, therefore, prima facie, respondents have the authority to charge reasonable entry fee as well as the parking fee, however, the same shall be in accordance with the provisions of the aforesaid Ordinance and decision taken by the Quaid-i-Azam’s Mazar Management Board and such income/expenditure is subject to annual audit in the instant case,” it concluded.
Waqef Shah had petitioned the SHC in 2022 against the authorities concerned over imposition of entrance fee on the visitors to the mausoleum and asserted that magnificent parks like Minar-i-Pakistan and mausoleum of the national poet Allama Muhammad Iqbal in Lahore had no entry fee for visitors.
He asserted that Rs30 per visitor entry fee was being charged at the mausoleum of the Quaid-i-Azam under the head of so-called maintenance, but entry tickets neither specifically mentioned the mausoleum’s under maintenance parts/location nor carried name of the vendors.
The petitioner sought directions for the respondents to allow the visitors at the mausoleum without charging any entry fee from them as well as to share complete details/standard operating procedures (SOPs) regarding maintenance of the mausoleum.

8,Drug trafficker jailed for life,KARACHI: A session court has sentenced a drug trafficker to rigorous life imprisonment for smuggling 40 kilograms of...,"KARACHI: A session court has sentenced a drug trafficker to rigorous life imprisonment for smuggling 40 kilograms of charas.
Additional and Sessions Judge (Malir) Liaqat Ali Khoso pronounced the verdict after carefully considering evidence from all parties involved and found Abdul Nasir guilty of smuggling 40kg of charas concealed under the rear seat of a rickshaw.
Additionally, the court imposed a fine of Rs1 million on him. In default of payment, the convict will face an additional six months of imprisonment.
Regarding the case property, the court has ordered that the confiscated narcotic substance and the rickshaw be preserved until the final decision of the case against the convict and the accused absconders, Jalil Ahmed and Muhammad Tariq.
“From the evidence available on record, the prosecution has established the case of possession of narcotics against the accused,” the court ruled.
According to State Prosecutor Riaz Ali Soomro, the apprehension occurred within the jurisdiction of the Ibrahim Haidri police station in February 2023. Acting on a tip-off during patrolling, the police intercepted a rickshaw. However, the driver fled upon seeing the police party. The law enforcement personnel apprehended Abdul Nasir from the rear seat of the rickshaw and recovered 40 packets, each containing 1kg of charas, wrapped in blue plastic bags.
In the detailed verdict, the judge noted that during the trial, the defence counsel did not contest the chemical examination report of the recovered substance. Although the defence argued that the police had falsely implicated the accused, the court observed a lack of evidence to substantiate this claim.
“The accused did not raise any objections regarding tampering, manipulation, substitution, or changes to the seal, property, or parcel,” observed the court.
Furthermore, the court acknowledged that the accused had no prior involvement in criminal activities, and the prosecution had not presented any documentary evidence to the contrary.
“It is a harsh fact that the drug business is an organised crime and private persons are not inclined to be the prey of the drug barons, drug tycoons and put themselves and their families in any danger of life and property, hence common people are reluctant to be in support of police in narcotics and other organise crime,” the court remarked.

9,"Wasa stops lifting water from Indus, off-taking canals",Says levels of impurities in  Hyderabad reservoirs constantly rising; water shortage in city may exacerbate in days to come,"HYDERABAD: The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) has stopped lifting water from its sources of intake in Indus river and its off-taking canals due to constantly increasing TDS (total dissolved solids) turning water unfit for human consumption.
The action is bound to aggravate water shortage in the city.
Wasa has taken proactive measure to address the issue, and lifting of water from various points of upstream and downstream Indus river and its canals has totally been stopped, according to a Wasa communication addressed to the higher authorities concerned.
On Monday (April 1), Wasa sought intervention of the Hyderabad commissioner urging him to take action and caution the general public against consuming this water. The Wasa managing director is said to have addressed his letter to the commissioner after values of TDS were found increasing as per the agency’s lab reports prepared on April 1.

Says levels of impurities in  Hyderabad reservoirs constantly rising; water shortage in city may exacerbate in days to come

The MD requested the commissioner that directives may be issued to irrigation department to increase freshwater flows into Indus river so that lagoons (storage reservoirs of Wasa) could be filled with safe water for onward supplies to consumers through filtration plants.
According to the lab reports, TDS in river water was recorded at 875mg per litre (mg/l) at 9am and then at 12noon. In filtration plant and lagoons, TDS stood at 732mg/l and 875mg/l, respectively. At 4pm on Monday, TDS were recorded at 774mg/l and 778mg/l at the filtration plant and lagoons, respectively.
As the TDS values continued to show an upward trend since the last week of March, the Wasa MD had to bring it to the notice of the Hyderabad commissioner and other authorities, including the additional chief secretary of local government, Hyderabad mayor, director general of the Hyderabad Development Authority (HDA), Hyderabad deputy commissioner and chief engineer of the Kotri Barrage.
“There has been consistent increase in TDS [levels],” says the communication. It mentions that the value started from 500mg/l TDS and shot up to 875mg/l by now. MD incorporated values of the TDS recorded at new filtration plant off Jamshoro road, Hala Naka, Paretabad and Hussainabad filtration plants in letter.
He also discussed available storages in Wasa facilities including lagoons. According to him, the new (30mgd filtration plant has left with two days of storage, Hala Naka and Paretabad three days each, Hussainabad upstream and downstream one day each and Latifabad has zero capacity.
Discharges from Manchhar halted
Water technologist Dr Ahsan Siddiqui told Dawn that discharges from Manchhar Lake had been stopped now. He has been monitoring quality of the lake’s water regularly under a Supreme Court directive. “TDS on March 23 at A.D. Baloch point was 548mg/l which dropped to 238mg/l on March 31,” said Dr Siddiqui. He said that sample from the A.D. Baloch point was collected as per standard operating procedure (SOP) for checking water quality.
“This is the point where Manchhar Lake’s water, released through Aral Wah, falls into Indus river after covering around four to five kilometre distance,” he said. He said that Manchhar lake’s own TDS was still as high as 3,130 mg/l due to releases of water into it from the Main Nara Valley Drain (MNVD).
Irrigation authorities have reported to water technologist that the releases into the Indus from the lake via Aral Wah had been completely stopped. 
Also on Monday, a filtration plant official was asked by the Wasa management to visit Manchhar Lake to see whether there were some leakages from Aral Wah into Indus river. 
Earlier, the Hyderabad DC had raised the issue with irrigation secretary about rising levels of TDS in Indus river water. But quality of Indus river water as per Wasa laboratory’s regular test reports shows that TDS levels are consistently registering an upward trend. “If irrigation authorities released water downstream Kotri Barrage, then water to Latifabad and various areas can be provided,” said a Wasa official.
MQM-P worried over imminent shortage
Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan MPA from Latifabad Sabir Kaimkhani has expressed his party’s concern over imminent aggravation of water shortage in the city. In a press release, he urged the commissioner and HDA director general to ensure adequate supply of drinking water to the city. He complained that Wasa was not supplying water his constituency.
He also called for increasing water storage capacity for Hyderabad maintaining that the existing reservoirs were insufficient. He said that unending power loadshedding had also made the matters worse. 
Adequate supplies promised
The Hyderabad DC and HDA DG have, meanwhile, assured the MPA that water supply to the entire city would be ensured. They told him that police assistance would be sought for the areas where water was not reaching. 
They said that a meeting of the district administration, HDA and Wasa would be held to resolve the issue.

According to National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor Jangu Khan, one more co-accused Abdul Ghaffar Depar, accountant in the deputy commissioner Naushahro Feroze office, has joined the trial. He first obtained protective bail from the Sindh High Court and then interim pre-arrest bail.
On Tuesday, he appeared before the court which had fixed the case for framing of the amended charge. The amended charge is framed whenever a new accused is arrested or joins investigation, according to the prosecutor. The charge was framed against all the accused. 
He said the case was adjourned till April 17. Those who are in custody, like former Matiari DC Adnan Rasheed, former AC Mansoor Abbasi and others, joined the court proceedings through zoom. The accused denied the charge. 
The Accountability Court-II judge framed the charge against 26 accused out of 42 nominated in the scam. Besides the 26 accused who are either on bail or in custody, 13 are still at large.
Earlier, the court had framed charge against the accused when the NAB filed a supplementary chargesheet in the land scam case, involving Matiari and Naushahro Feroze districts.

13,"Muttahida hints at quitting coalition govt if crime wave, killings not stopped in Karachi",Faisal Subzwari calls for operation to curb street crime in the city.,"• Subzwari calls for operation to curb street crime in Karachi
• Murad says govt committed to improving law, order in province
KARACHI: Perturbed at an alarming rise in cases of muggings and killings of citizens in the metropolis, a senior leader of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan has demanded an operation against street criminals and hints at parting ways with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led coalition government if the killing of innocent people is not stopped.
“The MQM-P will leave any government if people continued to be killed in Karachi during street crime,” said former federal minister and Senator Faisal Subzwari.
Senator Subzwari’s veiled threat came after Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah admitted that the law and order situation in Karachi had worsened during recent months.
Talking to the media on the premises of the Sindh Assembly on Tuesday, where he came with MPAs of his party for the Senate election, Senator Subzwari said that over 50 citizens had been killed in street crime in Karachi during the past three months but there was no one to catch the killers.
 
 

He said that earlier every targeted killing was blamed on the MQM-P and the institutions would come into action against his party.
He said that demands of an operation would have surfaced, if there had been such a slaughter elsewhere. “However, an operation against street criminals is not being demanded by political parties in Karachi,” he lamented.
Underlining the need of an operation against street crimes, he said that people of the city did not have the same weapons as criminals did. “I don’t know why the operation is not being started in Karachi,” he wondered.
He said that youth of Karachi was being killed after a few thousand rupees.
Senator Subzwari urged the federal interior ministry and the director general of the Rangers to take notice of the alarming surge in the street crime and killing of innocent citizens.
Taking exception to a recent statement of Home Minister Zia Lanjar on street crime situation in the city, the MQM-P leader said that the home minister was making mockery of the situation. “He is home minister, not a joke minister,” he jibed.
He said that it was the job of the home minister to enable police intelligence to curb street crimes in the city.
The MQM-P leader said that the Pakistan Peoples Party had been in power in the province for the past 15 years, but the law and order situation remained alarming during its successive tenures.
He said that people of the city were in a state of confusion as to who would solve their problems.
He said that the agreements with the IMF belonged to the state and not the government. “If the country defaults, the price of bread will reach Rs200,” he apprehended.
When asked about replacement of Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, Senator Subzwari said that there was no discussion about the change of the governor and it was not even under consideration.
CM admits law and order unsatisfactory
Meanwhile, talking to the media on the premises of the Sindh Assembly a little before casting his vote in the Senate election on Tuesday, CM Shah said that the provincial government was implementing strict measures to improve law and order in the province.
“These measures include addressing street crime in Karachi and kidnapping for ransom in the riverine area,” he added.
He also acknowledged that the law and order during their last tenure was not satisfactory, and it further deteriorated during the caretaker government. He said that the situation was not that bad during his previous tenure as it was in the months of January and February.
“However, the provincial government is committed to improving the situation and is taking steps to achieve this goal,” he added.
To a question, CM Shah stated that during his last term, he implemented effective measures to improve law and order in the province.
He said that street crime in the city was brought under control and police pickets were established along the Indus River embankment to restrict the bandits in the riverine area.
