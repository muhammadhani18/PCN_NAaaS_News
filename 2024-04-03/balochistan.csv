0,Separated couples move courts for family meetings,Rawalpindi judicial complex allocates two halls to facilitate parents’ reunion with children,"Divorced couples across the Rawalpindi district are filing applications in family courts for family visits to meet their children before Eidul Fitr.
These meetings, held in the judicial complex during the last week of the fasting month of Ramazan, last for about 2-2.5 hours. During these visits, divorced parents engage with their children, offering gifts such as clothes, toys, watches, and money.
They dedicate quality time to converse with their children, attentively listen to their wishes, and strive to fulfil their desires. Alongside parents, grandparents, grandmothers, aunts, and uncles also join these gatherings.
The judicial complex has allocated two large halls and rooms for these meetings, with appointed judicial staff overseeing the proceedings. Currently, fifty divorced couples have submitted petitions for these appointments, all of which are granted on humanitarian grounds. Parents from other cities can also submit applications before Eid and around 20-25 parents meet their children daily in these sessions starting from the 21st of Ramazan.
Children are prepared for these meetings and are brought to the court's judicial complex, accompanied by either their mothers, maternal grandmothers, or parental grandmothers.
Family courts determine custody based on factors such as the child's age, preference, and legal status following the divorce decree. Many parents also have court-ordered visitation rights once a month.
These Eidul Fitr meetings hold special significance as children receive Eidis during these gatherings, adding to the festive atmosphere and strengthening family bonds during this joyous occasion.

1,Tehsildars to monitor annual examinations,Educators say such interference could potentially disrupt examination process,"The Punjab province has assigned the responsibility of monitoring the annual examinations of Intermediate, FA, and FSC to Tehsildars, Naib Tahsildars, Gurudwaras, and Patwaris in the Rawalpindi division.
This initiative marks a departure from traditional practices and represents the first instance of such a responsibility being given to these officials in the history of Punjab.
The initiative has been started in the Rawalpindi Division, where Tehsildars, Naib Tehsildars, Gurudwaras, and Patwaris from the four districts will oversee examination centres throughout the division. This proactive measure aims to ensure the integrity and fairness of the examination process, particularly by cracking down on illegal activities like the booty mafia.
Furthermore, the Punjab government has expressed reservations regarding the reliance on teachers for examination duties as the current system is exploited by nefarious elements. As a result, the government has empowered finance officials to monitor examination centres, reflecting its commitment to reforming the examination process.
Assistant commissioners have allocated separate examination centres to Tehsildars, Naib Tehsildars, Gurudwaras, and Patwaris within their respective areas, which they will directly supervise. However, this decision has faced opposition from teachers' organisations, including the Punjab Teachers Union, Punjab SES Teachers Association, and Educators Association.
Leaders such as Muhammad Shafiq Bhalwalia, Akhian Gul, and Basharat Iqbal Raja have called for an immediate reversal of the decision to involve Patwaris in examination centres. They argue that such interference could potentially disrupt the examination process and undermine its credibility.
The concerns raised by teachers' organisations highlight the need for a balanced approach that addresses both the necessity for reform and the importance of maintaining trust in the examination process.

3,Eid shopping spree sparks traffic woes,Pickpocketing cases surge with spike in shoppers’ footfall in twin cities,"As the final days of the fasting month of Ramazan begin and salaries are disbursed to government and private sector employees, Eidul Fitr shopping has surged in both major and minor commercial hubs across Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
This uptick in shopping activity has led to a challenging situation regarding parking, with vehicles and motorcycles causing congestion in markets and commercial areas, disrupting traffic flow. The disorderly parking has not only paralysed transportation systems but has also resulted in heightened mental stress among pedestrians. The absence of traffic wardens has further exacerbated the traffic woes, contributing to an escalating problem.
With the increase in shopping enthusiasm, incidents of pickpocketing and theft from women's handbags have also been reported. The influx of shoppers has prompted the establishment of numerous stalls offering bangles, artificial jewellery, and henna across the city's markets, with henna stalls set to open the upcoming Friday.
Key commercial areas such as Murree Road, Saddar, Raja Bazaar, Bara Bazaar, Moti Bazaar, Commercial Market, Supermarket, Jinnah Super, Blue Area, Karachi Company, Abpara Market, and Asia's largest Tinch Bhatta Bazaar have witnessed a surge in customer footfall.
This influx has resulted in frequent traffic jams on major thoroughfares. Operating hours for commercial establishments have been extended until 2am, contributing to the bustling atmosphere and making even pedestrian movement challenging due to the crowds.
After Iftar, starting from 7:30pm, shoppers and families with children have been flocking to the commercial areas, continuing their shopping activities well into the night. Shopkeepers have adorned their shops with vibrant lights, flags, and balloons to attract customers, with cartoon characters adorning the entrance gates of major shopping centres, captivating the attention of children who joyfully take selfies with them.
In addition to the surge in Eid shopping, commercial areas have also seen an influx of professional beggars, despite bans against begging. The traffic police have noted that the Eid shopping rush began on Monday and anticipate converting major commercial centres into one-way routes temporarily to alleviate traffic congestion.
Efforts will be made to eliminate illegal roadside parking, enforcing mandatory parking only in designated areas. Additional traffic wardens have been deployed to major commercial centres to manage these responsibilities effectively, starting from Tuesday.

4,Attock police ‘side with murderers’,"DSP, SHO allegedly implicate murder victim’s brothers in fictitious cases","The family members of a murder victim have been running from pillar to post to seek justice after the Attock police in alleged connivance with the influential killers made their lives hell and implicated them in false cases of narcotics possession.
The police officers and officials continued pressurising the victim’s brother to reconcile with the suspects involved in the murder and when the plaintiff didn’t agree, the police allegedly implicated the complainant and his two brothers in three drug cases.
Later, a high-level inquiry was conducted on the orders of the Rawalpindi regional police chief and cops were declared biased. A regular departmental inquiry was then recommended against Pindi Gheb DSP and SHO Sajjad Haider.
Muhammad Rafiq from Aminabad, Attock complained to the police that on April 28, 2023, suspects Hammad, Tariq and their accomplices shot and killed his brother Safar Khan for refusing to give them a car. A murder case was registered. Police arrested Hammad on June 18 last year and declared Tariq wanted in the case.
The applicant alleged that some officers and officials of the Attock police allegedly forced him and his brothers to reconcile with the killers and started pressure tactics. When the complainant refused, a case (843/23) of narcotics possession was registered against Rafiq’s brother Shafiq in Attock police station on November 17, 2023.
On November 18, another case (849/23) under drug offence was registered against Rafiq in Attock city police station. Yet again on December 31, a case (283/23) was registered against Rafiq’s other brother Zeeshan at Basal police station for possessing drugs, making it impossible for the three brothers to pursue the case of their brother's murder. According to Rafiq, the police registered false cases against them by allegedly conniving with the accused.
It is learned that the then Rawalpindi RPO Syed Khurram issued instructions to the Regional Investigation Branch (RIB) to conduct a high-level inquiry into the entire matter and submit a report. According to the sources, the inquiry team called the Investigation Officers and the complainant along with the records, reviewed it and recorded the statements of the officers and personnel. During the hearing, SHO Sajjad Haider, referring to a voice call, got it listened to the RPO and others in the room, claiming that the applicant was threatening the subordinate staff over Zeeshan’s arrest. But when the inquiry team asked the SHO about any legal action against the threatening call, he remained silent and failed to give any evidence.
The inquiry team, in its report sent to the Rawalpindi RPO, expressed serious reservations and stated that after the murder case, several cases were registered against the plaintiff and his brothers for drug offences at different times. Similarly, the SHO’s silence also raised serious doubts. The inquiry report also found no previous record of cases against the three brothers and pointed fingers at the policemen’s mala fide intention. The report also recommended regular departmental inquiry against the Pindi Gheb DSP and the SHO.
When contacted, complainant Muhammad Rafiq said they all brothers are daily wage earners. The accused used to commit such incidents before and they have strong connections with the police, he said, adding the police used to call them to the police station, make them sit for hours and harass them as part of the pressure tactics. “Now we are trying to get bail,” he added.
SHO Sajjad Haider told The Express Tribune that the ANF and the police have registered cases of drugs against members of the said family, while cases of gambling have also been registered against one of them. The family members of the accused are included in the top ten list prepared by the Punjab IGP, he claimed and added he could present evidence in his defence at any forum.
Haider further said that the reputation of the accused could be verified from the Samundarabad area. Haider refuted the allegations of connivance and influence with the accused.
When The Express Tribune tried to get a version from Rawalpindi RPO Babar Sarfraz Alpa, he didn’t respond. However, his spokesperson said that in light of the findings of the inquiry report, orders for regular inquiry against the staff have been sent to the Attock DPO today.

5,"Centre, Punjab lock horns over IGP posting","DIG Ops ‘oversteps’ authority, conducts surprise visits, punishes SHOs","The Shehbaz-led government in the centre and Maryam-led government in Punjab have locked horns over the appointment of the Islamabad police chief for the last four days, throwing the entire police working out of gear, forcing three senior Deputy Inspector General (DIGs) of Police to seek leave and inviting a junior DIG to decide the operational matters.
After the departure of IGP Dr Akbar Nasir Khan and the Punjab government’s refusal to relieve Lahore DIG Operations Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, who was earlier appointed as the Islamabad police chief, the sitting Islamabad DIG Operations has reportedly started exercising the powers of the IGP.
Rizvi has yet to assume the charge of his office and the federal government has not cancelled his notification. Three senior DIGs of the Islamabad police -- Malik Owais, Hassan Raza Khan and Shoaib Khurram Janbaz -- have already applied for leave after the appointment of DIG Ali Nasir Rizvi as the Islamabad IGP. But they are still discharging their duties.
Sources in the Islamabad police said taking the liberty of the absence of the IGP, DIG Operations Syed Shahzad Nadeem Bukhari has started ‘aggressive’ surprise visits to the police stations and a series of punishments and rewards.
On Monday, he dismissed SHOs of two police stations, suspended seven others from service over poor performance and made new appointments on Tuesday.
The DIG operations, they added, suspended some cops from service after the outgoing IG proceeded on a foreign trip a couple of months back.
Reportedly, the meeting was held under the chair of the DIG Operations on Monday to review the crime situation. The SSP Operations, Zonal DPOs, SDPOs and all the officers and Moharras of police stations participated.
During the meeting, the performance of all the police stations was reviewed and each officer was investigated separately. Abpara SHO Sub Inspector Shafaqtullah and Sahala SHO Altaf Hussain were dismissed from service for poor performance, while SHOs of seven police stations were also suspended. Among those suspended are Margalla SHO Muhammad Hayat and Ramna SHO Shamsul Akbar, Sangjani SHO Fazal Khaliq, Nellore SHO Imran, Koral SHO Malik Rasheed, Lohi Bhir SHO Asim Ghafar and Hamak SHO Akhtar Zaman are included.
On the other hand, the I-9 and Karachi Company SHOs were awarded for their good performance. All other SHOs were given four days to improve their performance.
The DIG operations made it clear that all the personnel would remain in the police station and any official duty in the field would be subject to the permission of the DPO concerned. He further directed to accelerate the crackdown against wanted criminals and strengthen control at the checkpoints.
Bukhari further made it clear that corruption and unethical behaviour won’t be tolerated in the force and that there would be no compromise on an increase in the crime ratio. He gave four days to all the officers to improve their performance, and otherwise face punishments.
He ordered a more effective patrolling mechanism for the Dolphin Squad and Mobile Patrolling Unit with zero tolerance against bribery, corruption and misbehaviour with citizens. The DIG also threw his weight behind effective action against organised and active gangs to combat crime.
The DIG further directed the Investigation Officers to improve investigation skills and submit challans of cases in time.
New appointments
The DIG Operations appointed eight new SHOs in place of dismissed and suspended officers. According to a notification issued on Tuesday.
Sohail Ahmad has been appointed Koral SHO, Haider Ali Nilore SHO, Asif Khan Ramna SHO, Margalla Mehboob Hasan, Khurram Shabbir Aabpara SHO, Gul Khan Sihala SHO, Ashiq Khan Sangjani SHO, Nawazish Ali has been appointed Banigala SHO.

6,Rawalpindi acts to secure its airspace,"With a focus on banning kite flying and aerial firing, the city ensures flight safety","The Rawalpindi deputy commissioner has formed a 26-member joint operational team comprising police and civil defence personnel to enforce the permanent ban on aerial firing, pigeon flying and kite flying in the vicinity of Pakistan Air Force Base Nur Khan in Chaklala.
This team has initiated a major operation in the airport areas, targeting specific locations such as Dhok Gangal, Dhok Lalyal, and Jahaz Ground. As part of this operation, the team has dismantled the large pigeon cages constructed on the rooftops of houses, plazas, and markets.
Additionally, numerous pigeons were confiscated, and legal action has been taken against 13 kite-flyers. Cases have been registered against the offenders at different police stations.
The deputy commissioner has established a formal operational team based on the strict directives of law enforcement agencies.
District Officer Civil Defence Talib Hussain has been appointed as the focal person for this team. The team consists of five officials from the District Council, seven officials from the Municipal Corporation, and 12 officials from the Volunteer Civil Defence.
Additionally, two female police officials have been included in the operational team. On the identification, these women officers clear the way to reach the giant cages of pigeons on the roofs, where the operational team proceeds to break the cages and seize them.
The team initiated action on Tuesday, the first day of operation. The team freed 14 pigeons from their cages in the specified locations. The District Officer of Civil Defence and head of the operational team confirmed the operation and mentioned that it was carried out based on his instructions.

A case will be registered against the head of the house wherever there is aerial firing within the airport limits, and arrests will be made and sent to jail.
All civil defence volunteers in the designated areas have received instructions for monitoring. However, the police special branch will also provide a source report on which immediate action will be taken.

8,Eid frenzy at Rawalpindi’s historic Moti Bazaar,"Amidst the bustling lanes and rich heritage, shoppers find an array of treasures","In the bustling heart of Rawalpindi lies the iconic “Moti Bazaar,” a cherished trading hub for women spanning over a century and a quarter.
With half of Ramazan behind us, the fervour of Eid shopping among women has peaked in this 125-year-old historic market.
Moti Bazaar, boasting 250 diverse markets and approximately 3,000 shops, stands as a beacon for women seeking affordable essentials. Legend has it that a visit to Moti Bazaar is a requisite for completing Eid and bridal shopping in Rawalpindi.
From 10 am to 10 pm, the market witnesses a flurry of activity, bustling with women eager to explore its offerings. As the night wears on during this holy month, the shopping frenzy extends till 1am, making navigation through the labyrinthine lanes a challenge.
Within Moti Bazaar’s labyrinthine alleys, an array of women’s apparel, footwear, jewellery, cosmetics, and household items awaits.
Established in 1901 by the visionary Hindu entrepreneur, Moti Lal, the market continues to thrive, a testament to its enduring legacy. Situated amidst the ancient Raja Bazaar, Iqbal Road, Bohar Bazar and Lal Haveli, Moti Bazaar holds a storied past, with landmarks like the Krishnavanthi Mansion, now home to a Government Boys Girls School, bearing witness to its evolution.
The origins of Moti Bazaar trace back to Moti Lal’s altruism, as he provided refuge to widows, irrespective of their faith, challenging archaic Hindu customs. Through initiatives like the Kanya Ashram, where women learned vocational skills, Moti Lal laid the foundation for Moti Bazaar’s prosperity.
Over the decades, what began as a humble endeavour burgeoned into a vibrant marketplace, shaping the commercial landscape of Rawalpindi.
In the wake of partition in 1947, Moti Bazaar transitioned into Muslim hands, fuelling its commercial ascent. Today, it stands as a testament to communal harmony, catering to shoppers from the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad to the neighbouring districts of Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Azad Kashmir, Abbottabad and Hazara.
Amidst the Ramazan rush, the market brims with activity, illuminated by the glow of lights even at midnight. However, amidst the hustle and bustle, challenges persist, with incidents of theft plaguing unsuspecting shoppers.
Despite efforts to curb such crimes, pickpockets and professional thieves pose a persistent threat. Nevertheless, the spirit of Moti Bazaar endures, as generations of shoppers continue to patronise its diverse offerings.
Moti Bazaar traders Chaudhary Iqbal, Naveed Kanwal, and Tahir Taj Bhatti, affirm its cultural significance, drawing patrons from far and wide. As the month of Ramazan unfolds, the market remains a beacon of tradition and community, offering not just goods but a shared experience cherished by all who wander its storied alleys.

9,Healthcare revamp kicks off in Pindi,"New hiring, medicines and medical equipment for THQs, RHCs and BHCs planned","The Rawalpindi District Health Authority (DHA) has come forward with a plan for better treatment services for the general public at Tehsil Headquarters hospitals (THQ), Primary Health Centres and Rural Health Centres (RHC).
The DHA’s Chief Executive, accompanied by his team, has launched urgent inspections of these facilities throughout the district. The plan has been prepared for up-to-the-mark availability of medicines, doctors, staff and other facilities. The DHA has already received medicines in bulk.
The DHA has devised the comprehensive plan to complete the health indicators in all cases to revamp the health care system in all five tehsils of the district, Murree district and Kotli Sattian. This initiative follows the concerns of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz regarding the state of healthcare in the region.
Initially, the Authority has started visiting the health facilities in Rawalpindi tehsil, Kahuta, Kallar Syedan, Gujarkhan, Taxila, Murree tehsil, and Kotli Sattian tehsil to ensure the provision of health facilities in an effective way.
The second phase of the health care system will address the shortage of doctors, para-medical staff and electro-medical equipment. Consequently, these healthcare centres affiliated with the DHA will be able to provide the best treatment facilities to the citizens at their doorstep.
DHA CE Dr Ijaz Ahmed said that he has initiated his field tours beginning from Kotli Sattian and will visit all THQs, BHUs, and RHCs consecutively with the objective that all healthcare facilities deliver free and high-quality medical treatment to the public.
The provincial Secretary Health is taking an extraordinary interest in the initiative, he said, adding every healthcare centre must have the capability to provide treatment services to male, and child patients at their nearby centres.
The DHA has taken the fresh initiative when 48 posts of male and female doctors and medical officers (MOs) have already been abolished from the aforementioned health care centres.
On February 16, the Department of Primary and Secondary Health Care Punjab issued a notification regarding the abolition of 48 posts. As of now, this notification has not been rescinded, whereas the notification for the Sheikhupura district of a similar nature has been withdrawn.
Forty-eight medical officers, who were dismissed in the Rawalpindi district, were serving in government dispensaries, primary health centres, and other facilities. They are now awaiting the Punjab government will issue orders for the restoration of their positions by revoking the notification.
