0,Oltmans approached by PHF as Pakistan eye two major events,The cash strapped PHF is currently looking to hire Oltmans only for the Azlan Shah Cup and the Nations Cup.,"LAHORE: Roelant Oltmans has been approached by the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) to return as the national side’s head coach with the Azlan Shah Cup and the FIH Nations Cup around the corner.
The Dutchman has served the Pakistan senior and junior sides in the role during different periods since 2004 and was involved with the youth side in in his recent-most stint.
The cash strapped PHF is currently looking to hire Oltmans only for the Azlan Shah Cup and the Nations Cup, set to be held in Malaysia and Poland respectively in May-June, with the long-term agreement to come into question only after the two events.
Dawn has learnt the PHF has sent Oltmans the contract and that the coach is studying it.
“If he accepts the terms and conditions the PHF will hire him for the two tournaments,” a PHF told Dawn.
The federation is looking to set up the national side’s training camp in Islamabad from April 15 for the two tournaments and is hoping Oltmans agrees upon taking the coaching role — an agreement of two months — before it starts.
The last time the PHF hired a foreign coach to work with the national side, it was Oltmans compatriot Siegfried Aikman in 2022-23. The experience was one to forget for the latter as the PHF failed to pay his monthly salaries for one year due to the body’s differences with the Pakistan Sports Board.
Aikman received his dues only after he walked away from the job following a bitter time in Pakistan.

1,North Korean Ri beats Hou as world records broken,"Ri lifted 124kg in clean and jerk to earn a total of 221, a new world record in the weight category.","PHUKET: China’s Olympic gold medallist Zhihui Hou broke her own snatch world record at weightlifting’s World Cup in Phuket on Monday, before North Korean Ri Song-Gum equalled it and won the women’s 49kg competition by earning a new record total.
Hou, who lifted 96kg in the snatch in July 2021 to win gold in Tokyo, lifted 97kg to take the lead at the World Cup, before Ri matched her effort.
Ri lifted 124kg in clean and jerk to earn a total of 221, a new world record in the weight category, while Hou lifted 120kg and finished second with a total of 217.
Hou qualified for this year’s Olympics as the best performing Chinese athlete.
Ri is not eligible for the Paris Games because North Korea entered the qualifying programme too late, the International Weightlifting Fed­er­­ation (IWF) said in a statement.
Ri, who also holds the current world record in clean and jerk having lifted 125kg at the Asian Championships in February, attempted unsuccessfully to lift 126kg.

2,Russia accuses IOC chief of ‘conspiracy’ to exclude its athletes,Bach said in the call that the IOC was monitoring Russian athletes who had made political statements in support of their government.,"MOSCOW: Russia accused Inter­national Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach on Tuesday of taking part in a  “conspiracy” with Ukraine to exclude its strongest athletes from this year’s Paris Games.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova made the allegation after two Russian pranksters known as Vovan and Lexus published a recording of a conversation with Bach in which he was falsely led to believe he was speaking to an African sports official.
Bach said in the call that the IOC had established a special panel to monitor the media and the internet and ensure that Russian athletes who had made political statements in support of their government could not take part in the Olympics.
“We have also offered to the Ukrainian side — not only offered, but asked them — to provide us with their knowledge of the behaviour of such [Russian] athletes or officials,” Bach could be heard saying in English on the recording.
Zakharova posted on Telegram that Bach had  “entered into a political-administrative and, apparently, criminal conspiracy with one specific party” — meaning Ukraine —  “to exclude strong sports competitors from international competitions”.
She added:  “The relationship of IOC president Bach with the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine and its officials, and the admissions of a ‘request to monitor Russian athletes’ should be the subject of a thorough investigation.”
Relations between Russia and the IOC have worsened sharply in the run-up to the Olympics, at which Russian and Belarusian athletes will compete as neutrals, without their flags and anthems, because of the war in Ukraine. They have also been banned from taking part in the opening parade.
Pre-empting the publication of the prank call, the IOC said last month that Bach had been the victim of a hoax.
The IOC has publicly announced the establishment of a review panel to evaluate the eligibility of every Russian or Belarusian athlete who qualifies for Paris. In order to be cleared to compete, athletes must not have actively supported the war in Ukraine and must not be contracted to any military or security agency.

3,Inter close in on Serie A title with win over Empoli,MILAN: Runaway leaders Inter Milan continued their seemingly unstoppable march to the Serie A title after an early...,"MILAN: Runaway leaders Inter Milan continued their seemingly unstoppable march to the Serie A title after an early goal from Federico Dimarco and a late effort from Alexis Sanchez secured a 2-0 win at home against Empoli on Monday. 
Inter are top of the table with 79 points, 14 ahead of city rivals AC Milan in second place with eight matches left to play. Their sizeable lead means that Inter could potentially clinch the Scudetto during the city derby against Milan on April 22. 
Inter manager Simone Inzaghi, who celebrated his 100th victory with the club, lost his voice during the match, with assistant coach Massimiliano Farris taking over the post-match duties. 
“The tactics are working very well, the mobility of our defenders, but also the ability of the midfielders to cover the spaces when the defenders go forward, that is all teamwork,” Farris told DAZN. 
“We did better in the second half and the substitutions gave us a big hand to bring home the result, confirming the strength in depth of this squad.” 
Inter have a huge lead on their rivals thanks in large part to academy product Dimarco, whose first-time strike in the sixth minute from Alessandro Bastoni’s neat clipped pass separated the hosts from their spirited opponents for most of the match. 
It was Bastoni’s third assist in as many league matches and the Italy defender joked: “It was the worst of the lot, Dimarco’s finish made it look much better! 
“We’re really happy with the win because we’ve just come off the international break and it’s never easy winning after travelling around the world,” added Bastoni. 
Inzaghi’s side were far from the scintillating form they showed before being knocked out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid last month. 
And he rest of the first half ebbed and flowed, with Inter pressing to extend their lead, and Empoli goalkeeper Elia Caprile standing firm to deny them. Yet Empoli gained momentum towards the end of the half, creating chances that were narrowly off target. 
Inter came back with renewed vigour after the break and Nicolo Barella was inches away from scoring after beating three Empoli defenders. 
Substitute Sanchez was left unmarked to tap home Denzel Dumfries’ cross and double Inter’s lead in the 81st minute after a flowing passing move from the hosts. 
Davide Frattesi almost grabbed a third for Inter with the last kick of the match, but the ball slipped just past the post. 
Inter have dropped only two points since the turn of the year and Monday’s win was a good way to end what has been a difficult couple of weeks. 
Francesco Acerbi was cleared late last month of racially abusing Napoli defender Juan Jesus, an ugly episode which dragged on through the international break as the Italy defender and Inter denied the accusation. 
Acerbi started the game after avoiding a potential 10-match ban due to the Italian Football Federation’s disciplinary tribunal deciding there wasn’t enough evidence to punish him. 
A fourth straight defeat without scoring a goal left Empoli back in the relegation zone on goals scored, swapping places with 17th-placed Frosinone. 
“If that run had knocked our confidence you’d have seen it tonight with a bad performance but that didn’t happen,” said Empoli coach Davide Nicola.

4,Singapore’s only Olympic champion Schooling retires,"SINGAPORE: Joseph Schooling, the swimmer who famously beat his idol Michael Phelps to become Singapore’s first and...","SINGAPORE: Joseph Schooling, the swimmer who famously beat his idol Michael Phelps to become Singapore’s first and only Olympic champion, announced on Tuesday that he had retired from the pool at the age of 28. 
Known in the city state as “Singapore’s Flying Fish”, Schooling stunned the swimming world when he beat American great Phelps to win the 100 metres butterfly with a time of 50.39 seconds at the 2016 Rio Olympics. 
Schooling found it difficult to match that level of global success after 2016, winning a solitary bronze medal at the 2017 world championships and his career started to ebb after winning gold medals in the 50m and 100m butterfly at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta before he crashed out in the heats in his title defence at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. 
“Today marks the beginning of a new chapter — I will be retiring from competitive swimming,” he said in a message posted on Facebook. 
“I am filled with gratitude for every experience that swimming has brought into my life. The victories were exhilarating, the defeats humbling, and together, they have forged a resilience in me that I will carry forward into my next chapter.” 
In an interview with the Straits Times newspaper, Schooling said he had become complacent. 
“My mistake was the complacency to think that this will last forever because I’m so far ahead,” he said. “Add on ego, add on pride. Add on that ‘I’m never going to be shut down attitude’. That’s a recipe for complacency.” 
The defeats have been more frequent than the victories in the eight years since Rio but Schooling will retire with three Asian Games gold medals and 29 from the Southeast Asian Games. 
Schooling was left out of the Singapore team for last year’s delayed Asian Games in Hangzhou beca­use two other swimmers had recorded faster times. 
Schooling, who has performed two years of mandatory military service, was mired in controversy in 2022 after confessing to taking cannabis overseas. 
Singapore has some of the toughest drugs laws in the world, and citizens can face up to 10 years in prison if found to have consumed illegal substances outside the city-state. 
Schooling was given a warning and placed on a supervised urine test regime for six months. He was also made no longer eligible for leave to train or compete during his military service. 
“While I am stepping away from competing, swimming will forever be a part of who I am. It has given me a platform to inspire others to chase their dreams, no matter the odds,” he added. “I am eager to explore new passions, face different chall­enges, and see where this next phase of life takes me.” 
Schooling told the Straits Times he was now going to work with two venture capital partners in the “health and wellness, tech and sustainability” sectors, and play more golf.

5,Tyson says he is still huge draw despite age,NEW YORK: Mike Tyson will be 58 when he takes on Jake Paul on July 20 in Texas but he said fans are still clamouring...,"NEW YORK: Mike Tyson will be 58 when he takes on Jake Paul on July 20 in Texas but he said fans are still clamouring to see the former heavyweight champion in action.
The bout between one of the most feared fighters in history and YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul will be held at the 80,000-seat AT&T Stadium in Arlington and streamed live on Netflix.
“I’m 58 and what? I’m getting billions of views from just talking to somebody about fighting,” Tyson told Reuters. “Everybody, even most of the athletes, they’re jealous, that’s whack... I say in your prime you couldn’t draw a million people, man. What are you talking, you couldn’t sell out arena. Who at 58 could sell out an 80,000-seat arena?”
‘Iron Mike’, who has a 50-6 record with 44 knockouts, said the 27-year-old Paul recognises the public’s enduring interest in him.
“Why you think he wants to fight me and not anybody else?” Tyson said of Paul, who has a 9-1 record with six knockouts. “Everybody wants to fight him, all the boxers want to fight him. But if he fought them the only people that will come are the people that like him.
“The other guys, their parents might not even come watch them. That’s just keeping it real. They’re too boring for their children to watch, it’s like watching grass grow.”
The fight is the first for Tyson since he took on Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition bout in November 2020.
Although it has yet to be officially announced, the fight is also expected to be designated an exhibition, the USA Today reported.
That would mean the rounds would be two minutes as opposed to the traditional three, the boxers would wear heavier gloves that make it safer and there will be no official judges to score the rounds, so a victory could only come by knockout.

6,Saul takes Atletico fourth with late winner at Villarreal,VILLARREAL: Substitute Saul Niguez slotted home an 87th-minute winner to give Atletico Madrid a hard-fought 2-1...,"

VILLARREAL: Substitute Saul Niguez slotted home an 87th-minute winner to give Atletico Madrid a hard-fought 2-1 victory at Villarreal on Monday, as Diego Simeone’s side climbed back into La Liga’s top four with eight games left in the season. 
It was a much needed win for Atletico after two consecutive losses and two wins in their last seven league matches had left them in danger of missing out on a Champions League spot next season. 
They were facing an in-form Villarreal side, who were on a four-game winning streak and unbeaten in their last nine league matches, a run that earned Marcelino Garcia La Liga’s Coach of Month award in March. 
Axel Witsel nodded Atletico ahead after nine minutes but Alexander Sorloth pegged back the visitors soon after half-time of an entertaining clash. Saul decided an even game in the final stages less than five minutes after coming on. 
“[Saul] entered the game well and scored a great goal,” Simeone told Movistar. “I’ve put him on a bunch of times because I believe in him and I hope he can give us a lot.” 
Atletico moved to fourth in the standings on 58 points, two ahead of Athletic Bilbao, who lost 2-0 to leaders Real Madrid on Sunday. 
Girona are third on 65 points, two behind second-placed Barcelona. Real are comfortably ahead at the summit on 75 points while Villarreal are 10th on 38. 
Simeone said his team still needed to improve to lock down Champions League qualification for next season. 
“Athletic are having a very good season, Girona aren’t giving up, and we have to improve,” said the coach. “Pace of play and intensity decide things and we have to improve in that regard.” 
Witsel drew first blood with a fine header from Rodrigo Riquelme’s corner, twisting his body to meet the ball at the near post and direct it looping home at the far. 
The 35-year-old Belgian had only scored once before for Atletico, also against Villarreal last November. 
Villarreal goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen made two fine reflex saves from efforts by Samuel Lino and Marcos Llorente to keep the hosts in the game and Gerard Moreno wasted a great chance from close range to level just before halftime. 
But Alexander Sorloth took advantage of a mistake by Antoine Griezmann to equalise five minutes after the break. The French forward stepped on the ball and lost possession before Villarreal found Sorloth who fired a tidy finish past goalkeeper Jan Oblak. 
Atletico substitute Angel Correa flashed a shot narrowly off target and Alvaro Morata fired straight at Jorgensen, albeit from a wide angle, as Atletico scrambled to go back in front. 
Jan Oblak saved a low deflected effort from Yerson Mosquera at the other end, with the game opening up. 
As the tension grew, Correa’s header hit the crossbar before Villarreal’s Dani Parejo missed a sitter from close range. 
However, a resilient Atletico found the winner in the 87th minute when Cesar Azpilicueta fed Saul who calmly sidefooted the ball home left-footed from the edge of the area, and although Atletico had to nervously wait out a VAR check for a possible offside, the goal was given. 
Villarreal came close to levelling deep in stoppage time when Bertrand Traore’s cross evaded everyone and flew just past Oblak’s far post. 
“It was a difficult match,” Witsel told Movistar Plus. “Villarreal pressed more in the second half than in the first. We were better in the first half. We have to press at the back and do the job. [Simeone] will want us to do better next, but he will be very happy with the victory.”

7,"Division between PGA and LIV unsustainable  and a shame, says McIlroy",NEW YORK: The split in the men’s game between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf is unsustainable and...,"NEW YORK: The split in the men’s game between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf is unsustainable and will not benefit anyone in the long term, Rory McIlroy told Golf Monthly on Tuesday.
The four-time major champion said it was disheartening as a competitor to see the best golfers play in separate tours for most of the year.
“There needs to be a correction. I think what’s happening is not sustainable right now, so something needs to happen to try to bring it all back together so we can all move forward so we don’t have this division that’s sort of ongoing,” McIlroy said.
“They keep going down those different paths and I just don’t see how that benefits anyone in the long run... I think [it’s] a shame for the overall game of golf.”
Although negotiations on a merger between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf are ongoing, McIlroy said it is still a distant prospect.
“We’re probably still quite a long ways from it, but I would hope that in the future that we can get there, unify the game and get the best players back together again,” he added.
Talks between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf have dragged on and the PGA Tour secured a $3 billion investment deal with a consortium of US sports team owners called Strategic Sports Group (SSG) in January.
The PGA Tour is prepared to go it alone with SSG if a deal with LIV Golf cannot be done, tour commissioner Jay Monahan said last month.
“Ultimately [LIV Golf] do have some of the best players in the world that are playing some really good golf,” McIlroy said.
McIlroy will next compete at the Texas Open from April 4.

8,Olympians call for Brisbane 2032 stadium rethink,"SYDNEY: A group of local Olympians, including London 2012 champion hurdler Sally Pearson, have called on the...","SYDNEY: A group of local Olympians, including London 2012 champion hurdler Sally Pearson, have called on the Queensland government to reverse a decision to stage the athletics at the 2032 Brisbane Games in a 49-year-old suburban stadium.
The 14 Olympians and Paralympians, who also included swimming champions Leisel Jones, Jon Sieben and Grant Hackett, said in a letter that the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre (QSAC) was not a suitable venue for the Olympics.
“While we understand that you want to get the best value for taxpayers out of the Games, we do not believe that the QSAC site represents that, not just financially but also in terms of a legacy for Brisbane and Queensland,” they wrote. “And frankly, a main stadium with a capacity of only 40,000 would be an embarrassment which in no way would represent the go-ahead spirit of Queensland.”
Organisers originally planned to revamp the city’s Gabba cricket stadium to host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the athletics in 2032 but the local government blanched at the cost and ordered a review of plans last December.
The Quirk review reported last month and proposed a new purpose-built 55,000-seat Olympic stadium be constructed in an inner city park at a cost of A$3.4 billion ($2.21 billion).
State Premier Steven Miles rejected that recommendation on the grounds of cost and decided rugby stadium Lang Park would host the ceremonies with the track and field shunted to QSAC in southern suburbs of the city.
The letter from the Olympians echoes the comments of Australian athletics great Raelene Boyle, who said last month that Brisbane risked being viewed as a  “cheapskate” Olympics.
Miles promised that QSAC would be refurbished at a cost of A$1.6 billion but even that could be counterproductive, the Olympians said.
“The QSAC facility is the nursery of athletics in this state, and any disruption to the site could only hurt our performance in our home Games,” the letter added  “We all remember the magnificent event that Sydney put on in 2000. Queensland deserves something equally spectacular, without a centrepiece that would reek of compromise. It’s not too late to change your mind, Mr Miles.”
Miles, whose Labor government will be looking to secure a fourth straight term at state elections in October, sounded in no mood to change his mind when he spoke to reporters on Tuesday.
“They’re entitled to their opinions but we listen to Queenslanders. They’re talking to me about their hospital, about their school, about how hard they’re finding it to make ends meet,” he told Brisbane’s Courier-Mail.
“When Queensland is facing those kinds of day-to-day challenges, I can’t justify spending billions more on stadiums, no matter how many swimmers ask me.”
The International Olympic Committee (IOC)’s coordination commission for Brisbane met with organisers last week and said all plans, including those for venues, should meet the needs of the city rather than the Games.

9,Stokes rules himself  out of T20 World Cup title defence,The 32-year-old will skip the tournament in the United States and the West Indies to make sure he is fit to be a fully-fledged all-rounder in Test cricket.,"LONDON: England Test captain Ben Stokes has ruled himself out of the team’s T20 World Cup title defence, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced on Tuesday.
The 32-year-old will skip the tournament in the United States and the West Indies to make sure he is fit to be a fully-fledged all-rounder in Test cricket.
“Opting out of the IPL (Indian Premier League) and the (T20) World Cup will hopefully be a sacrifice that allows me to be the all-rounder I want to be for the foreseeable future,” Stokes said in an ECB statement.
Stokes’ withdrawal was something of a surprise given that, when asked last month if he would participate in the T20 World Cup in June, he said he had “not even thought about that but I’m available”.
It is understood Stokes has not suffered any setbacks after briefly returning to bowling last month during a Test tour of India, where England lost a five-match series 4-1.
There is no lingering discomfort in his left knee following surgery in November.
But although he has long been one of England’s leading multi-format cricketers, Stokes has decided to prioritise his role as Test captain.
He hopes to be able to play a full role with both bat and ball during six Tests — three against the West Indies and three against Sri Lanka — in the upcoming home season.
The first Test against the West Indies at Lord’s starts on July 10, less than two weeks after the June 29 T20 World Cup final in Barbados.
“I’m working hard and focusing on building my bowling fitness back up to fulfil a full role as an all-rounder in all formats of cricket,” Stokes said.
“The recent Test tour of India highlighted how far behind I was from a bowling point of view after my knee surgery and nine months without bowling.
“I’m looking forward to playing for Durham in the County Championship before the start of our Test summer.” 
‘FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS’
ECB chief executive Richard Gould, speaking to reporters at The Oval later Tuesday, said: “It was great to see him (Stokes) bowl in India for a short spell, but that probably has just told him how much he still needs to do in terms of his body.
“I think it’s great for English cricket he’s got that ambition and he’s had his knee sorted.
“Now he’s going to make sure that he’s back firing all cylinders because he’s still a relatively young man in terms of cricket.” Stokes was 
a central figure as England won the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia.
The left-handed batsman’s 42 against Sri Lanka in Sydney took England into the knockout rounds, while his unbeaten 52 — his first fifty in international T20 cricket — secured victory over Pakistan in the final in Melbourne.
Stokes delayed an operation on a longstanding left knee problem to play in last year’s 50-over World Cup in India, where reigning champions England suffered an embarrassing exit before the knockout stages after winning just three of their nine group games.
After undergoing surgery at the end of last year, Stokes was an ever-present in England’s defeat in India.
Following the Test series at home to the West Indies, England will tour Pakistan and New Zealand.

10,Sri Lanka near Test series victory against Bangladesh,"Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood praises Bangladesh’s fighting spirit, says they played well.","CHITTAGONG: Prabath Jayas­uriya, Lahiru Kumara and Kamindu Mendis each claimed two wickets as Sri Lanka came within grasp of another resounding victory in the second and final Test on Tuesday.
Bangladesh were 268-7 at stumps on the fourth day in Chittagong, still needing 243 runs for an improbable win.
Mehidy Hasan Miraz played an unbeaten knock of 44 to take the game into the fifth day with Taijul Islam accompanying him on 10.
Mominul Haque was the only other batsman to put up a fight, making 50 off 56 balls before he was dismissed by the spinner Jayasuriya in the last over before tea break.
Mominul denied that the team had lacked preparation. 
“Playing domestic cricket and international Test matches is very different,” he said.
Shakib Al Hasan and Liton Das put on 61 runs for the fifth wicket after Mominul’s dismissal.
Off-spinner Kamundu broke the stand as Nishan Madushka took a brilliant reflex catch at silly point to dismiss Shakib for 36.
Liton got the bottom edge in an attempt for a pull shot off Kumara to depart three overs later for 38.
Kamindu broke another promising partnership of 46 runs between Mehidy and Shahadat Hossain, trapping the latter leg before for 15. 
‘STRONG POSITION’
Mahmudul Hasan (24), fellow opener Zakir Hasan (19), and skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (20) were all sent back cheaply.
Jayasuriya bowled Mahmudul to break the 37-run opening stand.
Zakir gave a catch to Dhana­njaya de Silva off Vishwa Fern­ando at slip, and Lahiru clipped the bail of Najmul’s off-stump.
Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood praised Bangladesh’s fighting spirit. 
“I think Bangladesh played well today. They put the pressure back on the bowlers, they made life difficult for us,” he said. “I think we bowled well in patches — there were periods when we could have bowled better,” he added. 
“I don’t think we quite had the consistency in this innings as we showed in the first innings with the ball, but thankfully our hard work has put us in a strong position”.
Resuming on 102-6, Sri Lanka batted for a little over an hour to add 55 runs to their overnight score before declaring at 157-7.
Angelo Mathews, unbeaten on 39 overnight, top-scored with 56 runs. He was bowled by Shakib after making his 41st Test fifty. Jayasuriya was unbeaten on 28 when the declaration came, along with Vishwa Fernando, who was eight not out.
Debutant pace bowler Hasan Mahmud finished with 4-65 for Bangladesh. Sri Lanka were missing Dinesh Chandimal in the field after he returned home for a family emergency.
Sri Lanka, who have never lost a Test series to Bangladesh, thrashed the hosts by 328 runs in the first Test at Sylhet.
