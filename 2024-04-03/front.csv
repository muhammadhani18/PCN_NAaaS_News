0,K-P polls on hold amid oath-taking delay,"ECP issued a notification announcing the postponement of polls, citing its earlier order from March","The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) put the brakes on the Senate elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) on Tuesday, citing delays in the administration of oaths for reserved seats.
K-P Election Commissioner Shamshad Khan arrived at the assembly premises and requested a list of sworn-in MPAs from the assembly staff. Simultaneously, the opposition lodged a petition with the ECP, urging the postponement of Senate elections in the province.
While the rest of the country witnessed the Senate ballot brawl across the National, Punjab, and Sindh assemblies, the situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa hung in limbo.
Despite the stage being set and the election staff prepared, the K-P Senate polls failed to kick off at the promised hour of 9 am.
As the clock ticked closer to the appointed hour, contenders from all sides trickled into the assembly hall. However, while polling proceeded for 30 vacant Senate seats from the National, Punjab, and Sindh assemblies, uncertainty loomed over the situation in the province.
Subsequently, the ECP issued a notification announcing the postponement of polls, citing its earlier order from March and the upheld decision of the Peshawar High Court (PHC).
The notification highlighted the failure to administer oaths, as required under Article 218(3) of the Constitution, resulting in an incomplete electoral college.
Stating that the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had upheld its ruling, it noted that there were no arrangements made for the oath. Additionally, it stated that the Returning Officer (RO) for the Senate polls informed the electoral watchdog that the assembly speaker, Babar Saleem Swati, had yet to arrange the oath.
""The commission is of the considered view that the standards of honesty, justness, and fairness of election... cannot be fulfilled due to non-administration of oath to elected members,"" the ECP stated.
The electoral body delayed the elections, citing the electoral college's ""incompleteness,"" until the swearing-in of the elected MPAs on reserved seats in accordance with Article 218(3) of the Constitution, along with sections 4(1), 8(c), and 128 of the Elections Act, 2017.
Last week, the ECP had indicated a potential postponement of Senate elections in K-P if delays persisted in oath-taking. Speaker Babar Saleem Swati had filed a review petition against the PHC order directing him to administer oaths to 25 opposition MPAs elected to reserved seats.

1,Over 10m Pakistanis may slip into poverty: WB,Banks see sluggish growth rate of 1.8% coupled with soaring inflation at 26%,"In a dire forecast unveiled on Tuesday, the World Bank cautioned that over 10 million additional individuals in Pakistan face the looming threat of descending into poverty.
The apprehension stems from a sluggish economic growth rate of 1.8% coupled with soaring inflation at a staggering 26% for the current fiscal year.
The Washington-based lender’s biannual Pakistan Development Outlook report painted a grim economic picture, indicating that the nation is poised to miss almost all major macroeconomic targets.
Notably, the country is anticipated to fall short of its primary budget target, remaining in deficit for three consecutive years, contrary to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) stipulations mandating a surplus.
Lead author of the report, Sayed Murtaza Muzaffari, highlighted that despite a broad-based yet nascent economic recovery, poverty alleviation efforts remain insufficient.
Economic growth is projected to stagnate at a paltry 1.8%, maintaining the poverty rate at around 40%, with approximately 98 million Pakistanis already grappling with poverty.
The report underlined the vulnerability of those hovering just above the poverty line, with 10 million individuals at risk of slipping into poverty in the face of shocks.
The WB said that the poor and vulnerable are likely to have benefited from the windfall gain in agricultural output but these gains were offset by continued high inflation and limited wage growth in other sectors that employ many of the poor, such as construction, trade, and transportation.
The wages of daily labourers increased only 5% in nominal terms during the first quarter of this fiscal year when the inflation was above 30%.
The persisting cost-of-living crisis coupled with rising transportation costs could potentially lead to an increase in out-of-school children and delayed medical treatments, particularly for worse-off families, warned the WB. At the same time, food security remains a concern in parts of the country, it added.
Among 43 rural districts across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Balochistan, many of which were impacted by the 2022 floods, the prevalence of acute food insecurity is also projected to increase from 29% to 32% in the third quarter of this fiscal year.
“Poverty reduction is projected to stall in the medium term due to weak growth, low real labour incomes, and persistently high inflation,"" said the WB.
Chronic inflation in the absence of substantial growth, along with policy uncertainty, could cause social discontent and have negative welfare impacts, warned the Washington-based lender.
GDP growth
The World Bank said that Pakistan’s economy is expected to grow by only 1.8% in the current fiscal year ending June 2024. The official target is 3.5%.
For the next fiscal year too, the WB has projected only a 2.3% economic growth rate, which is even lower than the population growth rate of 2.6%. The lender said that the subdued recovery reflects tight monetary and fiscal policy, continued import management measures aimed at preserving scarce foreign reserves, and muted economic activity amid weak confidence.
It added that in the absence of major and sustained economic reforms, Pakistan is expected to continue to face foreign exchange liquidity issues due to the persistent trade deficit and limited access to external financing, especially from the private sector.
“Even with the recent successful completion of the IMF programme and continued rollovers of foreign debt, foreign exchange reserves are projected to remain low, hovering around 1.3 months of total imports over the three years”.
To a question, Tobias Haque, the World Bank’s lead economist, said that Pakistan has come out of the economic crisis but the outlook remains grim. He said that compared to a year ago, the economic crisis has been averted.
The report stated that macroeconomic risks remain very high amid a large debt burden and limited foreign exchange reserves.
“The structural reforms needed to durably improve the economic outlook are known. Developing a clearly articulated reform implementation plan that is ambitious, credible and that shows quick progress is now essential to restore confidence,"" said Najy Benhassine, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.
Najy said better fiscal management will help to lower inflation, narrow the current account deficit, improve financial sector stability and increase credit to the private sector, all of which are critical for robust economic recovery.
Inflation
The lender has projected inflation at 26% in this fiscal year due to higher domestic energy prices, which is far higher than the official target of 21%. For the next fiscal year too, the WB projected a 15% inflation rate.
With lower domestic demand and continued import management measures, the current account deficit is expected to remain low at 0.7% of GDP in this fiscal year –probably the only target that the government is going to achieve.
The lender said that despite easing global commodity prices, higher domestic crop production, and stability in the exchange rate, inflation pressures increased due to higher domestic energy prices and money supply growth.
Upward revisions in electricity and gas prices have substantially increased the overall cost of production. The rapid increase in money supply continues to exert inflationary pressures. The SBP injected substantial liquidity into the banking sector through Open Market Operations (OMOs), reaching Rs8.7 trillion by the end of December 2023. The credit to the public sector was 75.6% of the total bank credit.
Budget deficit
The fiscal deficit is projected to increase to 8% of GDP or Rs8.5 trillion in this fiscal year due to higher interest payments, which is far higher than the official target of 6.5%.
The WB said that the deficit will only gradually decline over the medium term as interest payments decrease and fiscal consolidation measures take hold.
As against the IMF target of a primary budget surplus of Rs400 billion, the WB said that there will be a primary deficit of 0.1% of GDP in this fiscal year. It has projected the deficit for the next two fiscal years as well.
The WB said growing exposure to the government is exposing the banking sector to risks. Despite a low CAD, the reserve position is therefore projected to further weaken, reflecting limited external financing.
The public debt as a share of GDP is projected to decline to 73.1% in this fiscal year –a threshold that is far higher than the statutory limit of less than 57% for this fiscal. It has recommended Pakistan to fully implement the Treasury Single Account to reduce the government’s cash holdings, reducing interest costs that in turn can save Rs424 billion annually.
The WB also sees a higher level of circular debt. It said that the power sector's circular debt has continued to grow. As of the end of January 2024, the circular debt stock stood at Rs2.635 trillion, including an additional flow of Rs463 billion since end-June 2023.
Recent large accumulations began in 2018 with the signing of “take-or-pay” contracts for large, imported coal and imported gas power plants. These have increased capacity payments by 50% and increased the country’s exposure to international fossil fuel price volatility—as witnessed over 2022, it added.
Circular debt on gas has emerged as another challenge for the sector. As of January 2024, gas circular debt stood at Rs2.9 trillion compared to Rs2.4 trillion in June 2023.
While consecutive gas tariff increases have contributed to containing growth, the accumulation is a result of delays in tariff adjustment, inefficiencies in the sector and increasing diversion of expensive RLNG to domestic consumers during winter months, it added.

3,"SC, LHC judges also get ‘powder-laced’ letters",CJP among recipients; CTD registers case,"A day after threatening letters containing a suspicious powdery toxic substance were sent to eight judges of the Islamabad High Court, it emerged on Wednesday that the Supreme Court jurists, including Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, as well those of the Lahore High Court had received similar ones too.
Islamabad DIG (Operations) Shahzad Bukhari made the disclosure before IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq.
The DIG (Operations), summoned by the IHC CJ during the hearing of the cipher case, informed that four SC judges -- CJP Isa, Justices Athar Minallah, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, and Aminuddin Khan -- had received similar letters on April1.
Additionally, letters were also received by SC’s Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Shahid Waheed posted by someone identifying themselves as Gulshad Khatun, according to sources.
During the hearing, the DIG Operations informed the court that all the envelopes contained letters as well as the powdery substance and they had been sent to the laboratory for an analysis.
Copies of the letters, suspected to contain anthrax powder, have also been handed over to the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) for investigation.
Furthermore, the police department has written to the relevant postmaster general on the issue of the stamps “not being discernible"".
The police officer further revealed that LHC judges had also received similar letters.
When questioned by the IHC CJ about the steps taken alongside the analysis of the letters, the DIG Operations replied that it appeared the stamps were from an area in Rawalpindi.
A CTD officer informed the court that the initial investigation indicated that the letters were sent from the General Post Office (GPO) Rawalpindi and dropped into a letterbox.
He added that the senders of the letters to the LHC judges had used various names including Resham and Reshma.
Expressing his dissatisfaction, the IHC chief justice reprimanded the police officers for their failure to properly identify the postal stamps.
The sources revealed that a meeting took place between the CTD team and SC registrar.
A case was registered at the CTD police station on the complaint of SC’s Receipt and Issue Department head Mohammad Iqbal Khan under Section 507 of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
It read that mail was received on March 29 or 30 through the post office. It was dispatched and received by the personal secretaries of the SC judges.
The mail contained four envelopes in the name of the CJP and three other SC judges.
The complainant said the administration in-charge told him on the phone on Wednesday that “a white powder-like chemical” was present in the four letters sent to the CJP as well as those addressed to the three other judges.
He added that three of the letters were sent by Gulshad Khatun from an “unknown address”.
Khan continued that the fourth letter was sent by Sajjad Hussain, who too had an “unknown address”.
The complainant said the two individuals had tried spread “fear and harassment”.
Earlier, a case in connection with the letters received by the IHC judges was also filed with the CTD.
The LHC judges, including the high court’s chief justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, also received threatening letters on Wednesday, prompting heightened security measures at the court premises to prevent any potential mishaps.
Sources revealed that the LHC staff initially overlooked the letter addressed to the chief justice, dismissing it as routine correspondence.
However, on opening the envelope, it was discovered that the letter contained a suspicious powder, the sources added.
Previously, similar letters were received by LHC senior puisne judge Justice Shujaat Ali Khan as well as Justices Shahid Bilal Hassan, Aalia Neelum, and Abid Aziz Sheikh.
On the discovery of these letters by the court staff on Wednesday, police officials stationed at the LHC were immediately alerted, and a search operation was initiated within the court premises.
A courier company employee was detained for further investigation.
Shortly thereafter, a team comprising the Lahore DIG Operations, CTD additional inspector general, CCPO, Crime Scene Unit, forensic experts, chief secretary, and other officials arrived at the scene to investigate the matter.
A credible source alleged that the letters were dispatched from Islamabad and were sent by an individual named Mohad Fazil, who purportedly threatened judicial officers, military personnel, and politicians.
It was reported that when a police officer opened one of the letters in front of a judge, some powder spilled onto the floor, prompting the jurist to reprimand him for the mistake.
The CTD officer criticised the police officer for the negligence, stating that it violated the standard operating procedures (SOPs).
Speaking to the media, DIG Investigation Ali Nasir Rizvi said an investigation was under way into the matter, emphasising that making premature statements before the conclusion of the probe would be inappropriate.
When asked about the contents of the letters and how they were identified as suspicious, Rizvi explained that the CTD was diligently investigating the matter and could not afford to take any risks without a thorough examination.
A day earlier, the IHC chief justice, along with seven other judges of the high court, received letters suspected to be laced with anthrax.
This incident occurred just after the apex court initiated suo motu proceedings in response to allegations made by the six IHC judges against intelligence agencies.
A police team, including experts, has initiated an investigation to gather evidence and determine the nature of the powdery substance found in the letters received by the eight IHC judges.
The letter, sent by an individual named Resham without a specified address, contained suspected anthrax powder along with a threatening message.
According to the sources, a court staff member inadvertently dropped an envelope containing the suspicious substance, resulting in severe irritation to the eyes and burns on the skin around the lips.
All suspicious letters have been handed over to the police for further investigation.

4,CJ hints at full court to hear meddling case,Isa says zero tolerance to attack on judiciary,"In a resolute stance amid allegations of encroachment on judicial independence, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa asserted on Wednesday that any assault on the judiciary's autonomy would be met with zero tolerance.
He hinted also at convening a full court session to address a suo motu case concerning allegations of meddling in judicial affairs by the intelligence apparatus.
""If there's any attempt to undermine the independence of the judiciary, I'll be at the forefront, and undoubtedly, my fellow judges will stand beside me. We do not tolerate any form of interference,"" the CJP asserted.
The SC convened to address the case, stemming from allegations raised by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), who accused the country's security apparatus of meddling in judicial matters.
A seven-member bench, including CJP Isa and justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Yahya Afridi, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Athar Minallah, Musarrat Hilali, and Naeem Akhtar Afghan, presided over the hearing.
Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan accompanied by Hamid Khan representing former prime minister Imran Khan, appeared before the SC. Ahmed Hussain appeared as Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan’s legal counsel, while President of the SC Bar Association (SCBA) Shahzad Shaukat was also present.
The hearing was adjourned until April 29. During the session, CJP Isa hinted at the possibility of convening a full court next time and said that the judges of the apex court would deliberate on the matter further.
Hearing
As the hearing began, Hamid informed the court of his desire to be listed as a respondent in the case. In reply, CJP Isa commented that gone are the days when the chief justice's discretion prevailed.
We have established a committee to schedule cases for hearings.""
He observed that the court had yet to receive Hamid’s petition, adding that the committee would deliberate on the matter upon its submission.
The CJP further noted that it was “inappropriate” for petitions to be publicised in the media before filing.
“When we talk about pressure being exerted, is this also exerting pressure on us in a way?” he mused, reiterating his steadfastness against external pressures.
The senior judge also expressed his dissatisfaction with lawyers advocating for a suo motu notice: “The lawyers are saying to take a suo motu [notice]; then they should leave their practice.”
Justice Isa pointed out that Hamid could not be deemed a “representative of lawyers” since the SCBA president already fulfilled that role.
AGP Awan then read out the press release issued by the top court following the meeting between the CJP and PM Shehbaz on March 28.
Justice Isa remembered his meeting with the IHC judges on the day he received their letter. He questioned, ""If we hadn't prioritized this matter, could this meeting not have been arranged after Ramazan?""
The chief justice remarked that a full court functions as an ""administrative body and does not engage in judicial functions.""
Regarding his and Justice Shah's meeting with PM Shehbaz, Justice Isa clarified that he met the premier in his capacity as the ""administrative head"" of the SC, considering him the ""state head"" as he garnered the most votes from the National Assembly. He emphasized that the meeting was not an informal gathering but an ""official administrative"" one.
AGP Awan pointed out inappropriate comments circulating on social media regarding the inquiry commission formed to investigate the allegations.
Mentioning ex-CJP Nasirul Mulk's consideration to lead the commission, the AGP recalled PM Shehbaz's meeting with Jillani, who indicated that he would decide on heading the commission after reviewing the Terms of Reference (ToR).

‘No tolerance for any form of interference’
At a particular juncture, the CJP stated, ""If there's any attempt to undermine the independence of the judiciary, I'll be at the forefront, and undoubtedly, my fellow judges will stand beside me. We do not tolerate any form of interference.
“If someone has another agenda to do so and so, then they may become the Supreme Court Bar president or the chief justice and enact his will. We will not tolerate pressure of this kind,” he added.
AGP Awan then emphasised that an inquiry commission possessed “great powers”, including the ability to initiate contempt proceedings. He added, ""There was a misconception portrayed in the media as if the federal government intended to establish a commission according to its own desires.""
In response, CJP Isa remarked, ""Who would want to serve in such a hostile environment? If a righteous individual is attacked, he may opt to withdraw and say, 'You deal with this.' Allegations were made that we were ashamed for the nomination.""
Highlighting the ""baseless criticism"" and ""personal attacks"" against Jillani, the CJP clarified that the former CJP was not leading the commission for financial gain. ""Following the social media backlash against Tassaduq Jillani, he chose to recuse himself from heading the commission,"" Justice Isa noted.
AGP Awan then read aloud Jillani's letter to the prime minister, announcing his recusal, stressing that the commission's proceedings were to be entirely judicial. He recalled that CJP Isa had proposed two names to lead the commission—Mulk and Jillani.
""The impression that the SC has relinquished its powers to the government or the commission is entirely erroneous,"" CJP Isa asserted. He instructed the AGP to review Article 175 of the Constitution, stating that the apex court's powers were outlined from Article 184 onwards.
""According to the Constitution, the SC lacks the authority to establish an inquiry commission; however, the federal government is empowered to do so,"" CJP Isa clarified.
AGP Awan urged the chief justice to examine the segment of the IHC judges' letter concerning the SJC.
""We've left the Constitution aside,"" Justice Isa remarked, questioning, ""How can the powers of the SC be delegated to someone else?""
""Every institution must operate within its prescribed boundaries,"" the chief justice affirmed. ""While it's possible that our institution may have exceeded its limits in the past, that is not the case presently,"" he added.
CJP Isa reiterated that according to the Constitution, the SC cannot establish an inquiry commission, while the federal government retains the authority to do so.
AGP Awan argued that the federal government remained steadfast in safeguarding the independence of the judiciary. He remarked, “From here, verdicts were given, JITs were formed, monitoring judges appointed against the law. What happened between 2017 and 2021 is in front of everyone.”
He also recalled cleric Agha Iftikharuddin Mirza’s “death threat” to Justice Isa in 2020, which prompted the CJP to urge setting it aside.
However, the AGP emphasised, “Discussing this is crucial. History should be brought to light. Mrs. Sarina Isa attempted to lodge a first information report (FIR) but was unsuccessful. The then-federal government referred the matter to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).”
“Sarina Isa provided a statement concerning Mirza Shahzad Akbar and Lt. General (rtd) Faiz Hameed, but no action was taken by the federal government at the time,” he added, highlighting that two CJPs retired during the period, while CJP Isa addressed the matter within 24 hours.
“We have the prime minister’s full support on this matter,” assured the attorney general to the apex court.
IHC letter
During the hearing, the case of former IHC judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui was referenced. Justice Isa remarked that the SC’s verdict on his case was “favourable” to the six IHC judges who authored the letter.
“Pressure on judges also extends to fellow judges, their family members, children, and friends. These days, there’s a new epidemic of social media, and there is pressure from the media as well,” observed CJP Isa.
He noted that although the judges’ letter mentioned family members of the judges being pressured, it did not specify who directly exerted pressure on the judges.
Furthermore, the chief justice pointed out that the IHC judges possessed the constitutional authority to initiate contempt proceedings, which could be utilised. “I cannot use another court’s powers to initiate contempt of court proceedings,” he stated.
Recalling that the IHC judges’ letter surfaced during the tenure of former CJP Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Isa stated that he was “neither consulted nor informed of the matter” by his predecessor.
CJP Isa mentioned that he promptly met with the IHC judges upon being notified by his secretary of their visit. “Although I am not in an executive role, I still made time to meet with the judges,” he added.
“If judges issue a notice of contempt of court, then all parties must appear to provide an explanation,” observed Justice Isa.
He noted that he took note of the statement made by over 300 lawyers but did not observe any of their signatures on it. “In this manner, anyone could claim to represent my or your views,” remarked the chief justice.
“Either trust in democracy completely or not at all; it cannot be selective in obedience. Next time, you can win the election and come,” remarked CJP Isa.
Inquiring of the AGP, Justice Minallah referenced Mirza’s threat against Justice Isa and queried, “Did you ascertain whether it reached a resolution or not?”
Justice Mandokhail, referencing the 2019 reference against CJP Isa, mentioned that “the then-PM (Imran Khan) acknowledged it was a misstep” and questioned what steps should be taken in response.
CJP Isa then commented, “Mistakes have occurred in the past and continue to happen, but we have demonstrated our accountability.”
Reflecting on the emergence of the IHC judges' letter during the tenure of former CJP Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Isa clarified that he had been “neither consulted nor informed of the matter” by his predecessor.
CJP Isa highlighted that upon being notified by his secretary of the IHC judges' visit, he promptly met with them. “Despite not holding an executive role, I still made time to engage with the judges,” he added.
Observing the necessity for all parties to appear and provide explanations if judges issue a notice of contempt of court, Justice Isa asserted.
He pointed out that while he acknowledged the statement made by over 300 lawyers, none of them signed it. “This leaves room for anyone to claim representation of my or your views,” remarked the chief justice.
“Democracy must be trusted entirely or not at all; selective obedience is not acceptable. If you wish to lead, win the election next time,” commented CJP Isa.
Addressing the AGP, Justice Minallah queried about Mirza’s threat against Justice Isa and whether any resolution had been reached.
Referring to the 2019 reference against CJP Isa, Justice Mandokhail raised concerns about the acknowledgement of its misstep by the then-PM (Imran Khan) and questioned the appropriate course of action.
‘Mistakes of the past’
Responding to this, CJP Isa acknowledged, “Mistakes have occurred in the past and continue to happen, but we have demonstrated our accountability.”
Justice Minallah pointed out the prevalent discourse on accountability without tangible actions, suggesting that pursuing cases to their conclusions would warrant discussions.
In response, the CJP clarified, “That case was related to me. I do not wish to create the impression of exerting pressure.”
Acknowledging the occurrence of political manipulation, Justice Minallah hinted at the potential involvement of the court in such matters.
AGP Awan then attributed the presidential reference against Justice Isa to the SC’s 2019 verdict on the Faizabad sit-in, stressing the government's responsibility tfulfilll accountability obligations.
