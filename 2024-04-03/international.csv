Russian officials said its jamming devices locked onto a Ukrainian drone near Tatneft’s Taneco refinery, which has an annual production capacity of more than 17 million tons (340,000 barrels per day).
Pictures from the scene indicated the drone hit the primary refining unit, CDU-7, at the refinery in Russia’s highly industrialised Tatarstan region, though it did not appear to have caused serious damage. The industry source said the personnel was returning to the plant.
A fire broke out at the refinery but was extinguished within 20 minutes, the state news agency RIA said, adding that output had not been disrupted. The unit that was hit accounts for around a half of the plant’s total annual production capacity. The refinery accounts for about 6.2pc of Russia’s refining capacity.
Brent briefly rose above $89 a barrel for the first time since October amid concern over the Ukrainian drone attacks and the escalating conflict in the Middle East.
A military intelligence source in Ukraine said the primary Taneco refining unit had been hit, causing a fire. The aim of the strike, the source added, was to reduce Russia’s oil revenue. Another Ukrainian intelligence source said Ukrainian-made drones had also hit a Russian plant producing long-range  “Shahed” attack drones, causing  “significant damage”.According to calculations, around 14pc of Russia’s refining capacity has been shut down by drone attacks. There is more demand for refined oil products than for Russian crude.

1,"China won’t ‘sit idly by’ on tech curbs, Xi tells Biden",Xi accuses the United States of creating economic risks with Biden’s sweeping ban on high-tech exports.,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden and Xi Jinping clashed in a telephone call on Tuesday about US trade restrictions on technology and on Taiwan, but they looked to manage their tensions, with two top US officials to head shortly to Beijing.
The telephone conversation was the two leaders’ first direct interaction since a summit in November in California that saw a marked thaw in tone, if not the long-term rivalry, between the world’s two largest economies.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will leave on Wednesday and visit both Guangzhou, the southern city emblematic of China’s manufacturing power, and Beijing, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken due in China in the coming weeks, officials said.
“Intense competition requires intense diplomacy to manage tensions, address misperceptions and prevent unintended conflict. And this call is one way to do that,” a US official said in a briefing to reporters.
The official said the talks were not aimed at resolving differences, and the two leaders were open about heated disagreements. Xi accused the United States of creating economic risks with Biden’s sweeping ban on high-tech exports.
“If the United States insists on suppressing China’s high-tech development and depriving China of its legitimate right to development, we will not sit idly by,” Xi warned, according to Chinese state media.
Biden rebuffed his appeal, with the White House saying he told him  “the United States will continue to take necessary actions to prevent advanced US technologies from being used to undermine our national security, without unduly limiting trade and investment.”
The White House said Biden pressed Xi to ensure  “peace and stability” across the Taiwan Strait ahead of the inauguration on May 20 of President-elect Lai Ching-te.

2,Fire kills 29 people at Istanbul nightclub,Workmen had been renovating basement when fire broke out.,"ISTANBUL: A fire that raged from the basement of a 16-storey block in central Istanbul left at least 29 people dead on Tuesday, with flames and thick smoke billowing for hours despite a massive emergency response.
By late afternoon around 20 fire trucks and ambulances were still crowded around the building, where builders had been working on a nightclub in the basement.
A police cordon kept onlookers and traffic 100 metres (yards) away from the scorched facade, while a reporter saw three exhausted firefighters sat on the ground with smoke-blackened faces and equipment.
The fire began at 12:47 (0947 GMT), the city governor’s office said, but it was only in the late afternoon that Davut Gul’s team announced the blaze was out. As well as the 29 killed, one hurt person was still being treated in hospital, his office said.
It was not immediately clear whether the victims dies from smoke inhalation or from the flames.

Workmen had been renovating basement when fire broke out

“An investigation has been opened into the fire that occurred in Gayrettepe (neighbourhood) in the Besiktas district of Istanbul,” Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya posted on X. According to the governor’s office, workmen had been renovating the basement nightclub when the fire broke out.
All the men working on the site were dead, the governor’s office said, adding that it had  “issued five arrest warrants”, including for the club’s owner and manager. “Three of the suspects have been arrested and two more are being sought,” it added.
Mounting toll
The authority had earlier reported that the fire broke out in the below-ground levels of the 16-storey block in Besiktas. The toll rose throughout the afternoon, with most of the 12 people initially reported seriously hurt then succumbing to their injuries despite hospital treatment.
“I’ve lost four friends,” local man Fikret Kaya said as firefighters were leaving the scene, but could not say any more. Not far from him, a woman wearing a black cap was weeping with her head in her hands.
The venue, a popular Gayrettepe nightspot called  “Club Masquerade”, boasted several stages and regularly gave live concerts. Its license was first issued in 1987 and renewed in 2018, governor Gul said, adding that the club was being  “maintained and renovated”.
TV images from the scene showed large flames roaring from lower-storey windows, spewing a column of thick black smoke that hugged the building’s facade.
Istanbul’s newly re-elected mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who rushed to the scene, said  “the fire is under control. Let’s hope there are no further victims”, offering his  “condolences” to the relatives of the dead and injured.

3,Moscow plans to remove Taliban from list of terror groups,"“This is a country that is next to us, and one way or another we communicate with them,” says Kremlin spokesman.","MOSCOW: Russia said on Tuesday it had important matters to discuss with Afghanistan’s Taliban leaders and was working to remove the Taliban from its list of banned terrorist organisations.
“This is a country that is next to us, and one way or another we communicate with them,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
“We need to resolve pressing issues, this also requires dialogue, so in this regard we communicate with them like practically everyone else — they are the de facto authority in Afghanistan.” 
Peskov did not elaborate on the  “pressing issues”, but Russia suffered its deadliest attack for 20 years last month when gunmen stormed a concert hall outside Moscow, killing at least 144 people.
The militant Islamic State group claimed responsibility and US officials said they had intelligence that it was the network’s Afghan branch, Islamic State Khorasan, that was responsible. 
Russia has said it is also investigating a Ukrainian link, something Kyiv and the United States have strongly rejected.

4,12-year-shooter kills classmate in Finland,"HELSINKI: A 12-year-old opened fire on Tuesday at a school north of the Finnish capital Helsinki, killing a ...","HELSINKI: A 12-year-old opened fire on Tuesday at a school north of the Finnish capital Helsinki, killing a classmate and seriously injuring two other children, with police saying they were still investigating the motive and lead-up to the incident.
The Viertola school in Vantaa, Finland’s fourth-largest city, has around 90 staff and 800 pupils in grades one to nine, or aged seven to 15.
“Today, after 9am, a shooting incident took place at a school... in which a sixth grader, a student of the school, died,” Ilkka Koskimaki, chief of the Eastern Uusimaa police department, told a press conference, adding that two others were  “seriously injured”.
Police had earlier said that both the suspect and the injured were 12 years old. They have opened an investigation into murder and attempted murder. In an afternoon update, police said they had been able to conduct an interview with the young suspect.
“The police are investigating, among other things, the motive for the act and the reasons for the incident,” Detective Chief Inspector Marko Sarkka, who is leading the investigation, said in a statement, adding more information would be shared on Wednesday.
Police also said a technical investigation of the crime scene had begun at the school, which would continue on Wednesday.
The child who was killed died at the scene, and the suspect had already fled the school by the time police arrived.

5,Deadly strike on Iran consulate ‘crossed a line’: analysts,Say Netanyahu thinks Israel will have to fight ‘war with Iran’ and he wants US to join it.,"BEIRUT: A deadly strike blamed on Israel against Iran’s diplomatic mission in Damascus could trigger a spillover of the Gaza crisis across the region, an escalation Tehran had sought to avoid, analysts said.
Monday’s strike levelled the consular annex of the Iranian embassy and killed 13 people, including seven members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iranian state media reported.
They included two senior commanders of the Guards’ Quds Force foreign operations arm, Brigadier Generals Mohammad Reza Zahedi and Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi, Iranian officials said. Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group called the attack  “a significant escalation”. “By targeting an Iranian diplomatic facility, Israel has crossed a line,” he said.
After months of aggression in Gaza, Israel is now stepping up its operations against Iranian and pro-Iran commanders in Lebanon and Syria, a move observers fear could spiral into all-out war.

Say Netanyahu thinks Israel will have to fight ‘war with Iran’ and he wants US to join it

Although Iran has said it wants to avoid full-scale war, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned on Tuesday that  “Israel will be punished” for the Damascus strike, while President Ebrahim Raisi said the raid  “will not go unanswered”.
‘Transnational war’
The Damascus strike could  signal that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, entangled in Gaza for nearly six months, is preparing for a wider regional  conflict.
Under pressure from Washington,  “Netanyahu is running  out of time to conduct the war in Gaza, and is instead turning to  Lebanon and Syria to weaken the Iranian regional military effort,” said  Nick Heras of the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy. “Israel  views the conflicts against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon as  two fronts in a transnational war against Iran, which the Iranians run  from Damascus,” Heras added. He said Netanyahu  “expects Israel to have  to soon fight a region-wide war with Iran” and for the United States to  join it.
“The Israelis are trying to eliminate the most important  and seasoned IRGC commanders to weaken Iranian planning and capabilities  ahead of that war,” he added. But diplomatic efforts are underway to  de-escalate tensions, with Syrian ally Russia calling for a UN Security  Council meeting on the strike.Washington has told Tehran it was  not involved in the Israeli strike, according to an American official  quoted by US media outlet Axios.
Bassam Abu Abdallah, who heads the Damascus Centre for Strategic Research and is close to the Syrian government, said that,  “there were rules of engagement, but now it’s an all-out war between Israel and the resistance axis”. “It is now clear that the trend is towards escalation,” Abu Abdallah said, adding:  “We could start to see increased attacks against US bases in Syria, Iraq or elsewhere.” In late January, pro-Iran groups said they were suspending attacks against US troops in Iraq and Syria to avert a regional escalation, after both Baghdad and Tehran said they opposed the groups’ campaign.
On Tuesday, Hezbollah warned that the strike on the Iranian consulate  “will not pass without the enemy receiving punishment and revenge”.

6,World’s most powerful MRI scans first images of human brain,"This power allows the machine to scan images with 10 times more precision than the MRIs commonly used in hospitals,","SACLAY: The world’s most powerful MRI scanner has delivered its first images of human brains, reaching a new level of precision that is hoped will shed more light on our mysterious minds — and the illnesses that haunt them.
Researchers at France’s Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) first used the machine to scan a pumpkin back in 2021. But health authorities recently gave them the green light to scan humans.
Over the past few months, around 20 healthy volunteers have become the first to enter the maw of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, which is located in the Plateau de Saclay area south of Paris, home to many technology companies and universities.
“We have seen a level of precision never reached before at CEA,” said Alexandre Vignaud, a physicist working on the project. The magnetic field created by the scanner is a whopping 11.7 teslas, a unit of measurement named after inventor Nikola Tesla.
This power allows the machine to scan images with 10 times more precision than the MRIs commonly used in hospitals, whose power does not normally exceed three teslas. On a computer screen, Vignaud compared images taken by this mighty scanner, dubbed Iseult, with those from a normal MRI.

7,WHO reports sharp rise in newborn deaths in Gaza,WHO spokeswoman says least 15 malnourished children are coming in per day at the only paediatric hospital in northern Gaza.,"GENEVA: Newborn mortality is rising sharply in the Gaza Strip, with babies being born underweight, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday, citing medics on the ground.
“From different doctors, particularly in the maternity hospitals, they’re reporting that they’re seeing a big rise in children born with low birth weight, and just not surviving the neonatal period because they’re born too small,” WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said at a briefing in Geneva.
She said that at Kamal Adwan, the only paediatric hospital in northern Gaza,  “at least 15 malnourished children are coming in per day, and the needs are just getting ever more severe”.
The WHO is unable to establish precise statistics on child mortality because of the devastation in the Palestinian territory after six months of Israeli aggression, with Harris saying many people do not even get to hospital.
She cited a stabilisation centre set up last week, saying the inpatients were typically children with medical illnesses as well as malnutrition.
“If you have got an underlying condition, malnutrition will kill you much more quickly, so they become the most urgent patients,” she said.
On Monday, the Israeli army pulled out of Gaza City’s Al Shifa Hospital after a two-week military operation that left much of the complex in ruins and bodies scattered on the dusty grounds.
The hospital was the biggest in the Palestinian territory.
“Al Shifa Medical Complex is gone forever,” its acting director Marwaan Abu Saadah said in a WHO video filmed at the scene.
Harris added:  “It’s no longer able to function in any shape or form as a hospital.”  “Destroying Al Shifa means ripping the heart out of the health system,” she said, noting that it was a major hospital with 750 beds, 25 operating theatres and 30 intensive care wards.

8,Sanchez says Spain will recognise Palestinian statehood by July,"Sanchez said he would propose that parliament vote in favour of this recognition by the end of the current legislature, that is, by mid-2027.","MADRID: Spain’s left-wing government is determined for parliament to  recognise Palestinian statehood by July this year, Prime Minister Pedro  Sanchez said during a visit to Jordan, Spanish media reported on  Tuesday.
“We have to think seriously about doing it this  semester,” Sanchez told a group of Spanish journalists accompanying him  on a tour of three Middle East countries, the media reported.
Sanchez  had said on March 9 he would propose that parliament vote in favour of  this recognition by the end of the current legislature, that is, by  mid-2027.
Then on March 22, Spain and three other nations — Ireland, Malta and Slovenia — issued a joint statement on the sidelines  of a European Union leaders’ summit in Brussels saying they were   “ready to recognise Palestine” once the conditions for the setting up of  a state were met.
Top-selling daily Spanish newspaper El Pais  said Madrid’s recognition of Palestinian statehood could happen during  the campaign for the European Parliament elections, which in Spain will  be held on June 9, or  “in the weeks that follow”.
The paper said  Sanchez, who after Jordan will visit Saudi Arabia and Qatar, wants to   “try to convince Arab countries that have not yet recognised Israel to  do so”.
Saudi Arabia and Qatar do not recognise Israel.
Sanchez  has repeatedly said the only solution to the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict is the recognition of two states, Israel and Palestine.
Since 1988, 139 out of 193 UN member states have recognised Palestinian statehood.
Israeli  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose governing coalition includes  extreme right and ultra-Orthodox parties, has long ruled out Palestinian  statehood.
According to the reports, Sanchez said he expected events to unfold in the conflict ahead of the European Parliament elections in early June and highlighted ongoing debates at the United Nations.
He said that he believed there would soon be a  “critical mass” within the European Union to push several member states to adopt the same position, according to EFE.

9,Move launched to rename Washington airport after Trump,"“Dulles is an old, ugly airport that no one wants to see. So I think this is a fitting tribute,” says Democratic congressman Brendan Boyle.","WASHINGTON: Travelers flying into the US capital could soon be landing at  “Trump International Airport” if several devoted lawmakers triumph in a legislative campaign that is almost certain to fail.
Trump supporters in the House of Representatives on Tuesday launched the effort to rename Washington’s main airport in a gesture of admiration for the former president who is running to regain the White House.
The airport is currently named after John Foster Dulles, secretary of state in the 1950s, while a smaller airport in the city is named after former president Ronald Reagan.
Congressman Guy Reschenthaler, the Republican Party’s chief deputy whip in the House, said he was introducing legislation to change the name because Trump was  “the best president of my lifetime.”  “As millions of domestic and international travelers fly through the airport, there is no better symbol of freedom, prosperity and strength than hearing ‘Welcome to Trump International Airport’ as they land on American soil,” Reschenthaler said.
The bill has at least six co-sponsors, but is not on track to become law as Republican support in the House is uncertain and the Democrats control the Senate and the White House.
The draft bill would require the name change in any law, regulation, map, document or other official record.
Coming just after April Fools’ Day, the campaign drew sharp jibes from opponents.
“Dulles is an old, ugly airport that no one wants to see. So I think this is a fitting tribute,” said Democratic congressman Brendan Boyle.
