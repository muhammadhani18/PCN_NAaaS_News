0,PHC seeks ECP’s response to plea against delay in Senate polls,"Contempt petition also filed against PA speaker, deputy speaker.","PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court on Tuesday sought reply from Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to a petition challenging its order of making the Senate polls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa conditional to taking of oath by opposition members elected on seats reserved for women and non-Muslims.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Syed Arshad Ali issued the order after preliminary hearing of the petition filed by leader of Pakistan Tehreek-i- Insaf and a candidate for Senate polls, Mohammad Azam Swati, who challenged the ECP’s order of March 28 about possible postponement of Senate polls in the province.
The petitioner has requested the court to order ECP to hold Senate polls in the province on April 2 as scheduled.
The petition was filed on March 30 before the Tuesday’s announcement of ECP about postponing the polls to the extent of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa till administration of oath to the elected members against the reserved seats.

Contempt petition also filed against PA speaker, deputy speaker

On March 28, ECP declared in response to the applications of five women MPAs-elect that if the speaker of the provincial assembly failed to comply with the directions of the high court to administer oath to the lawmakers elected on reserved seats, it [the commission] would be constrained to postpone Senate election in the province until the administration of oath to the applicants.
The petitioner’s counsel, Ali Zamanm argued that Senate polls were being conducted across the country and ECP postponed the same in KP on ground of the high court’s order of asking the assembly speaker to administer oath to the members elected on reserved seats.
He said that the order of ECP was illegal and unconstitutional. He stated that the petitioner was a contesting candidate, but he was neither heard by ECP nor was he issued any notice for it.
The counsel argued that ECP had no powers to postpone Senate election in the province when the same was conducted in other parts of the country.
Justice Attique Shah observed that in other provinces assemblies were complete as all the members had taken oath, whereas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa the members elected on reserved seats had yet to take oath.
The bench wondered when in Punjab they made arrangements with the government and senators were elected there unopposed then why only in KP oath was not administered to the said MPAs.
It inquired to what extent the order of the high court to the speaker of the assembly to administer oath to the members was implemented.
The counsel stated that ECP had misinterpreted the earlier order of high court and postponed Senate election on that pretext. He added that the impugned order of ECP was uncalled for and against the law.
Meanwhile, the bench also adjourned hearing of three review petitions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati requesting for reviewing its judgment of March 27 wherein the petitioner was directed to administer oath to the MPAs elected on reserved seats.
After preliminary hearing, the bench decided to hear the review pleas after detailed judgment was released in the said cases.
The high court had on March 27 accepted three petitions of around 20 of the members elected on reserved seats and ordered the speaker of the provincial assembly to administer oath to them and also to allow and facilitate them in casting votes in Senate election on April 2.
Advocate Ali Azim Afridi appeared for the speaker and contended that the order was liable to be reviewed by the court in line with Constitution and established rules.
He stated that administering oath to members was only possible when assembly session was summoned or requisitioned as per the mandate of Article 65 of Constitution. He added that the speaker couldn’t summon a session on his own unless requisition was filed by one fourth of the members of the assembly.
The bench observed that as detailed judgment had so far not been released by the court, therefore, the review pleas would be heard later.
CONTEMPT: Four women opposition MPAs elected on reserved seats on Tuesday filed a contempt petition against the speaker and deputy speaker of KP Assembly requesting the court to initiate contempt proceedings against them for not implementing its order.
The petitioners including Shazia Tehmas, Faiza Malik, Amina Sardar and Shazia Jadoon also requested the court to order disqualification of Speaker Babar Saleem Swati and Deputy Speaker Suriya Bibi from holding any public office as they had willfully flouted the March 27 order of the high court.
The petition, filed through senior lawyer Aamir Javed, stated that the speaker should have done necessary correspondence for the requisitioning of the session of the assembly and including administering oath to MPAs as Agenda Item No 1 by April 2 but no process for oath taking had been arranged, thus openly defying the time bound order of the high court.

They also destroyed a house in the Kormang area. However, no one was hurt in the incident as the residents moved to safety in time and put up tents in the open.
People said vehicular traffic on the road, which connected Kormang with Bisham city and other parts of the district, was suspended due to landslides restricting their movement.
A social media video showed a mass of land and mud slide down the hill to destroy a house in the Lashkar area.
The calamity-hit family moved to their agricultural fields and made a makeshift shelter for them with the help of tents.
Resident Afzal Khan said the house was inhabited by daily-wage worker Swal Faqir and his family.
He demanded that authorities immediately provide tents and warm clothes to the family for their protection from the severe cold weather.
Resident Dr Daud Khan Nawab said the landslides restricted people to their houses as they could neither go to the Bisham Bazaar to buy groceries nor could they take patients to the hospital.
He said the Kerai-Kormang Road had become a “nuisance” as it got blocked after rainfall and landslides, much to their misery.
The resident said the road was blocked by the landslides at two points.
The local residents of Kormang demanded that the government and district administration send heavy machines to the area, remove the rubble, and open it for smooth traffic, as well as protect the nearby houses from the constant landslides.
GUTTED: A fire gutted a tailoring shop in the Aloch area of Puran tehsil destroying clothes, sewing machines, and other goods.

4,PHC restores woman MNA elected on reserved seat,Sets aside ECP’s order to suspend Sadaf Ihsan,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Tuesday restored Sadaf Ihsan as an MNA elected to one of the National Assembly seats reserved for women on the quota of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Syed Arshad Ali accepted a petition filed by Ms Sadaf and declared that the Election Commission of Pakistan’s act of suspending its notification to declare her an MNA was illegal, so it had been set aside.
Ms Sadaf had challenged the ECP’s March 11 notification that put on hold another order about her election as the returned candidate on a reserved seat.
The suspension of election notification came on the formal complaint of JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and another candidate on the ‘priority list’ of the party, Hina Bibi.

Sets aside ECP’s order to suspend Sadaf Ihsan

Mr Fazl claimed that the name of Ms Sadaf was not on the priority list submitted by his party for the National Assembly seats reserved for women from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He added that Serial No. 4 of that list had Sadaf Yasmeen, who didn’t submit her nomination papers, and not Sadaf Ihsan.
The bench had accepted the petition on March 19 setting aside the order of the ECP. It, however, decided to rehear the plea as earlier, it didn’t issue a notice to the JUI-Fazl’s chief to seek his response.
Advocates Mohammad Ishaq Shah and Farhan Tariq appeared for the petitioner and argued that his client was named on the priority list of the JUI-F and was validly declared a returned candidate on the reserved seats for women.
The bench asked lawyer for the ECP Mohsin Kamran Siddique about the “original” records related to reserved seats that it had sought during the previous hearing.
The counsel said he had submitted the record according to which, in the initial priority list, the name of the candidate was Sadaf Yasmeen, whereas there was no mention of her parentage or identity card number.
The petitioner’ lawyers said initially, the name was erroneously mentioned as Sadaf Yasmeen, as Yasmeen was the mother of the petitioner. They added that the error was corrected during the scrutiny of nomination papers.
The counsel contended that the ECP had issued the impugned notification in an illegal manner as it had no powers under the Constitution or the Elections Act, 2017, to suspend the notification of an assembly candidate elected to any of the reserved seats.
They said that once the election tribunals were notified to decide election disputes, the ECP had no jurisdiction to see such complaints.
Lawyer for other candidate Hina Bibi contended that his client’s name was on the priority list and therefore, she should have been notified as an MNA.
He said initially, her client’s name was not on the list of contesting candidates, so she moved first the high court and then the Supreme Court getting the relief of the inclusion of her name in the list.
The lawyer saidthe party itself claimed that its candidate was Hina Bibi and not Sadaf Ihsan and therefore, the former should be notified as MNA.
During the hearing, Justice Arshad Ali observed that under Section 104 of the Elections Act, the priority list submitted by a political party should not be subject to any change or alteration.
On the previous hearing, the counsel for the JUI-F said the petitioner was not on the priority list submitted by the party for the National Assembly seats reserved for women from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He added that the petitioner was not a member of the JUI-F.

Association’s chairman Ghulam Bilal Javed led the delegation. A few months ago, the association had got the desk approved.

He said that the Islamabad Excise facilitation desk had greatly benefited residents of Charsadda, Mardan, Swabi and other districts. Bilal Javed urged the provincial minister to promptly restore the desk for the convenience of people.
Mr Rehman assured the delegation that he would discuss the matter with the chief minister and make a decision after Eidul Fitr.
The delegates also included Maazullah Khan from the car dealers association, Peshawar chapter, and vice-president of Peshawar Traders Chamber Basit Khan.

Talking to Dawn here, Hanifullah, Arshad Zaman, Ali Akbar, Mohammad Jalil and others said they had applied for the travel document in urgent category some four months ago paying Rs7,500. They said they were being told that the department concerned was short of paper.
The residents said several people wanting to perform Umrah were also deprived of the opportunity due to delay in getting passport.
Izhar Ahmad Qazi, a resident of Qaziabad Timergara, told Dawn that he had applied for passport in normal category on Dec 12 last year paying a fee of Rs4,500, but had yet to get it. He said he had been visiting the Timergara passport office for last three months, but to no avail.
He complained he failed to accompany his family to offer Umrah.
A normal passport with Rs4,500 fee is usually issued in 12 days, while the urgent one with a fee of Rs7,500 is issued only in four days.
The applicants demanded of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and director general passports and immigration to take notice of the matter.
ANP: Awami National Party on Tuesday denied the reports about supporting the Jamaat-i-Islami candidate for the Balambat tehsil chairman slot.
ANP Lower Dir spokesman Murad Mishwani told reporters that a party representative had participated in a multiparty meeting regarding the Balambat tehsil chairman election, but that didn’t mean support for the JI candidate for the slot.
He said ANP had nominated Malik Hayat Yousafzai for the position.
The ANP spokesman said there was no truth in the news being circulated on different social media platforms that ANP was supporting the JI nominee for the slot.
The Balambat tehsil chairman position was declared vacant when the PTI-elected chairman failed to return to the council despite repeated calls from the election commission. He has been in the hiding after the May 9, 2023 violence.

They said that the construction work, spanning several months, resulted in major obstacles due to excavation activities along the main road from Baghderai to Mingora. The accumulation of debris and earth along the roadway considerably narrowed its width, causing inconvenience to commuters, they added.
“The ongoing construction work near Fizagat Park has now blocked almost half of the road. Thousands of vehicles traverse daily this road, connecting the three tehsils of Swat. However, due to construction activities, the road experiences frequent blockades.” said Anwar Anjum, a resident of Mangalwar.
Residents said that the road also served as a crucial link to Shangla. They said that the road connected thousands of people from upper Swat and Shangla to lower Swat.
“Typically, it would take around 30 minutes to travel from Mingora to Charbagh. However, due to the ongoing construction work, the journey now takes almost two hours,” said Ihsan Khan, a resident of Charbagh. He added that during the month of Ramazan, they struggled to reach home timely for Iftar due to the delay caused by the construction work.
Locals expressed apprehension regarding the influx of thousands of tourists during Eid vacations. They said that tourists utilised that road to access upper Swat.
“In normal circumstances, the road experiences blockages due to the large number of tourists from various parts of the country. If the construction work continues during Eid vacations, it will pose a significant problem to both tourists and locals,” said Nawab Ali, a resident of Bahrain.
In response to public grievances, Deputy Commissioner Dr Qasim Ali Khan instructed removal of debris from the road and its reopening to traffic during a meeting regarding the ongoing Mingora Gravity Water Supply Scheme project.
The focus of the discussion was on maximising facilities for tourists during Eid vacations. Representatives of water and sanitation service company, ZKBK project manager, PMCSC resident engineer and other officials attended the meeting.

14,Pakistan urged to emulate Saudi e-governance model,Experts say success is outcome of Saudi vision to create a backbone of data and disseminate it in national mainstream,"ISLAMABAD: Speakers at a conference here discussed the successful e-governance model of Saudi Arabia and how Pakistan could emulate it.
The conference on e-governance in Saudi Arabia and opportunities and lessons for Pakistan was held on Tuesday at Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI).
The objective of the conference arranged in collaboration with World Echo WE News was how Pakistan could emulate the successful e-governance model of Saudi Arabia that had not only transformed the Saudi society as a whole becoming more inclusive but had also sped up public services dislodging the bureaucratic hurdles.
Dr Babar Majid Bhatti, CEO National Information Technology Board (NITB), was the chief guest.
He said Saudi Arabia is number one on the index of countries who have transformed after starting from scratch in 2017. This primarily is an outcome of its vision to create a backbone of data and disseminate it in the national mainstream.

Experts say success is outcome of Saudi vision to create a backbone of data and disseminate it in national mainstream

He also said the industry was looking for catalysts and transformers and not those who can sit on the problem by evaluating academic debates. Some of the great accomplishments that came the Saudi way are National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA), a monolithic landscape of development intended to tap the best of talent, and the highest level of commitment from the leadership.
The speakers said Saudi Arabia with a population of around 40 million had made great strides in information technology and its desire to digitise the society had transformed it within a span of less than a decade.
While drawing parallels, it was noted that though Pakistan possesses some of the great talent and industrious initiatives it was lack of digital foundations that ailed it.
Retired vice admiral Khan Hasham bin Saddique, who also served as an envoy in Saudi Arabia, said 85 per cent of Saudi society had access to e-governance and more than 50pc of its revenue was from non-oil resources.
The participants said Pakistan’s fundamental problem was lack of facilities to opt for digital financial transactions.
IPRI President Dr Raza Mohammad, Director Research retired Brig Dr Raashid Wali Janjua, and WE News Director Ammar Masood also participated in the dialogue. They said a state-sponsored policy to facilitate private sector was the need of the hour in order to harness the best of potential that Pakistan possesses and streamline the same into e-governance. It was also noted that e-procurement can cut down 60pc of transaction cost and boost efficiency. The reason why Saudi Arabia has progressed is that it has taken out red-tapism from its bureaucracy and evolved it on a format of ease-governance.

It formed special teams to check gas theft.
SNGPL regional manager Rehmatullah Marwat told reporters here on Tuesday that the public utility would check industrial, commercial, and domestic gas connections during the campaign.
“Last year, we detected 4,459 cases of gas theft. Of those offenders, 43 had tampered with gas meters. They’re heavily fined,” he said.
Mr Marwat said the SNGPL recovered Rs3.4 million fines from its lawbreaking consumers and made the recovery of Rs1.7 million arrears.
He added that Rs8.52 million fine was imposed after gas theft was detected at a CNG station.
The official said the owner of the CNG station was still at large.
He said the public utility laid 14km of pipelines last year under the energy saving plan, while 29km of old pipelines would be replaced this year to address the gas leakage issue.
Mr Marwat said special squads were cracking down on the use of gas compressors and imposing heavy fines on culprits.
FOREST CONSERVATION: Former chief forest conservator of Hazara Division Syed Muqtada Shah said on Tuesday that a “balanced approach to forest harvesting” would usher in the development of the local communities.
He told reporters here that while forest harvesting was an integral part of forest management, ensuring transparency and employing appropriate methodologies were paramount.
Mr Shah expressed concern about the fast-track harvesting, which, he said, could compromise transparency and undermine the sustainability of forest resources.
He highlighted the importance of a balanced approach over its economic benefits and environmental preservation.

19,"Iqbal Momand remembered for his services to police force, literature",First death anniversary of martyred police officer observed in Peshawar,"PESHAWAR: Poets and writers paid glowing tributes here to Iqbal Momand, a police officer and noted Pashto poet, on his first death anniversary.
A large number of literati, fans and local elders attended the event. They paid tributes to the martyred police-cum-poet for his matchless services to the force and his contribution to Pashto literature.
The event was arranged under the auspices of ‘Ya Qurban Pakhto Adabi Jirga Sherikaira’ (YQPAJS) wherein local poets and writers praised the self-less services of the slain police officer and poet for his people and the country at large.
Murad Ali presented a brief introduction of the martyred police officer. He said that Iqbal Momand was born in 1978. Hailing from Khadokhel Adezai, he graduated from the historic Islamia College Peshawar and joined police department. He was associated with radio Pakistan Peshawar and several literary organisations.

First death anniversary of martyred police officer observed in Peshawar

Pashto poet Fazal Momand, who chaired the event, said that DSP Iqbal Momand was an honest and brave police officer. He said that the slain police officer always advocated peace, humanism and patriotism in his poetry and earned widespread fame during his lifetime.
He said that Iqbal Momand never surrendered to militant’s narrative and embraced martyrdom last year in a terror attack on his convoy in Lakki Marwat district. Besides an honest police officer, he was a poet par excellence, advocating the message of peace and universal humanism that earned him respect and appreciation, he added.
Javed Shah Darman, in his brief speech, pointed out that KP police’s sacrifices should be upheld and visionary poet-cum-officer deserved kudos. He said that Iqbal Momand set an example that would be hard to follow.
“Iqbal Momand’s poetry left an indelible mark on modern Pashto literature due to his eloquent expressions. He was loud and clear and never minced words when it came to counter narrative of terrorists,” he said.
Aamir Khan Beqarar, another poet, said that poets and intellectuals were considered passive but Iqbal Momand proved that myth wrong and misplaced as he laid down his life for the sake of his people and land. “His poems and ghazals would serve as a candle light for the budding bards. He is a trend setter though,” he commented.
Qurani Khawani was also held on the occasion in which local poets, elders and fans took part.
Later, a group of poets led by Zahideen Afridi laid a wreath on the grave of the martyred police officer and poet.
