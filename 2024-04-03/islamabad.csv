The ophthalmologist at Al-Shifa Trust, Dr. Tayyab Afghani, stated that the springtime brings an extremely high pollen count, which can cause burning and redness in the eyes.
He said that eye allergies can cause watery and puffy eyes, but the same remedies and self-care techniques that relieve the symptoms of nasal allergies also work for eye allergies. 
In addition to sneezing and a stuffy, runny nose, the symptoms can include red eyes, irritation, itching, tearing or runny eyes, swollen eyelids, soreness, burning, or pain, he added.
Dr. Tayyab Afghani said that ocular allergies result from the body overreacting to an allergen, just like any other allergy. The immune system produces antibodies that release histamine and other chemicals from the eyes, causing red, watery eyes and irritation.
Typically, seasonal allergies occur in early spring, during the summer, and into the fall. He informed that allergens in the atmosphere, such as spores from mold and pollen from grasses, trees, and weeds, are known as triggers.
He claimed that aside from causing momentary blurriness, ocular allergies, commonly known as allergic conjunctivitis or eye allergies, do not significantly endanger vision. 
In many cases, symptoms appear as soon as the allergen comes into contact with the eyes. 
According to Dr. Tayyab Afghani, the first step is to try to avoid triggers by staying inside during high pollen count periods, which are often mid-morning and early evening.
In order to protect their eyes from pollen, people should drive with their windows closed and wear large sunglasses or eyeglasses. 
He said people frequently use eye drops to treat severe, chronic ocular allergies. However, prolonged use of these drops can lead to negative effects; therefore, it is advisable to use them temporarily.

1,Bhara Kahu bypass develops ‘compaction’ fault,CDA official says cost of project has increased to over Rs7bn due to additional work,"ISLAMABAD: A 400-metre portion of the newly-constructed Bhara Kahu bypass – a pet project of then-prime minister Shehbaz Sharif – has developed a ‘compaction’ fault after which one of its tracks has been closed to traffic moving towards Murree.
The Capital Development Authority (CDA) said the traffic was being diverted to the other side of the road and repair was underway by the contractor.
“Yes, a portion of the road faced some compaction issues and settlements, now it is being redone by the contractor. Settlements often occur on newly constructed roads,” said an officer of the CDA. He claimed the contractor – National Logistics Cell – was doing the said work through its resources and the CDA had provided no funding for the said task.
It is relevant to note here the said mega project was completed in just 10 months as the federal government wanted to get the project completed as soon as possible. The original cost of the project was Rs6.5 billion; however, the scope of the project was expanded. Recently, the CDA board was told that the NLC had moved a bill worth Rs1.8 billion against the additional work.

CDA official says cost of project has increased to over Rs7bn due to additional work

The CDA had referred the bill to the consultant firm of the Punjab government, which endorsed the additional work and recommended the approval of Rs1.3 billion. The board after approving the recommendation of the consultant directed the engineering wing to place the issue before the CDA’s Development Working Party (DWP) for the final approval. 
“So technically when the amount of additional work is added, then the cost increases to Rs7.8 billion,” said an official of the CDA finance wing. 
This is not the first time that the project has run into a hiccup. Due to the special interest of the then-premier, the CDA and the NLC did round-the-clock work and this over-efficiency also contributed to at least two accidents during the construction of the bypass.
The mega project considered a blessing for the residents of Murree and Bhara Kahu provided a much-needed respite from traffic jams which were a routine feature of the Bhara Kahu bazaar before its inauguration in August 2023. 
To provide relief to the public, the PDM government led by Shehbaz Sharif started this project and got it completed in August last year. The road was opened to traffic in August last year but only for light traffic. An official said that after the repair work, this road should be opened for heavy traffic as well to get the maximum benefit of this mega project.
“I am surprised to see such a fault on this road, which is said to be constructed with billions of rupees. We request the government to complete this repair work for the smooth flow of traffic,” said Rizwan Ahmed, a resident of Bhara Kahu.
A CDA officer assured that the word would be completed within a few days. They added that at present the traffic was diverted to one side of the road with the help of reflectors and dividers. “There is no need to be worried,” the official claimed.

The case registered at the Secretariat police station includes sections 147, 149, 188, 186, 353, 341, 427, 337, and 506 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The procession was led by a certain Asghar Naqvi, whose name is included in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act
Police said the procession comprising up to 250 persons started from the residence of Mr Naqvi and reached Qadeemi Imamia Masjid in Bari Imam where it was intercepted by a contingent of the capital police, including the Secretariat, Pulgran, Bhara Kahu police besides the Dolphin Squad.
Police said the procession was taken out without an NOC from the district magistrate and Section 144, barring assembly of more than five people, was also imposed in the federal capital.
According to the police, the participants of the procession scuffled with the police when they asked them to wrap up the procession as “it was illegal and taken out without prior permission”. Subsequently, clashes resulted between the police and the mourners.
As a result of violence, a constable and an assistant sub-inspector were injured, said police. The police responded with teargas to disperse the procession whereas the participants pelted the police with stones which also damaged vehicles parked in the area.
The police said that the participants of the procession also blocked the road and later entered Bari Imam Shrine after breaking a gate, adding that the participants mourned inside the shrine and later the police arrested 18 participants of the procession.
A spokesman for the police said that the procession was taken out every year, but it has a history of confrontation with another sect. There is an issue with the route of the procession between the two sects, he said, adding that it was illegal to take out such rallies without prior permission. In light of the issue over its route, the said procession – being taken out for the past several years – does not get permission from the district administration on account of a possible law and order situation.

5,Christian community satisfied with probe into church fire,NCM member says govt and police authorities are providing security and safety to minorities.,"GUJAR KHAN: Representatives of the Christian community visited the Presbyterian church that was gutted in a ‘mysterious’ fire last week, and examined its burnt interior.
Albert David, member of the National Commission for Minority (NCM), under the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony; Pastor Adeem Alfanso, Jawaid Masih and other members of the community exchanged their views on the unfortunate incident.
Pastor Alfanso, while talking to Dawn, said: “We would accept all developments and outcomes of the probe. All institutions are subservient to God, according to the teachings of the Holy Bible. We have no doubt that any institution or any person would do us injustice, and there is no doubt in our minds. We are satisfied with the developments. It is our city and our people, and we cannot allow doubts and differences to crop up among the residents who are living in complete harmony.”
The pastor said the church had been functioning since 1930 and no such incident had ever occurred.

NCM member says govt and police authorities are providing security and safety to minorities

When asked whether he was satisfied with the safety measures taken by the police and local administration, Adeem Alfanso said: “Yes, the police are providing protection to our worship gatherings regularly. We are especially thankful to Rescue 1122, who had promptly extinguished fire on the call of the salesman of a pharmacy.”
He said the police’s forensic wing had collected evidence and their expert opinion would be accepted with open hearts.
The community members, including their Pastor, were of the view that the charred building had outlived its strength and a new and well-designed building should be constructed by the government as a gesture of love for the Christian fraternity.
Albert David expressed his resolve to bring the demand into the notice of the higher authorities. He hoped that the building department would prepare a feasibility report after carrying out technical assessment of the structure.
Mr Alfanso said the forensic report would clarify everything, whether the fire had broken out due to short circuiting or there was any nasty attempt. He reiterated that they would accept the report and investigations of the police.
The police investigator, Sub-inspector Malik Karamat, briefed the NCM member about the preliminary investigation and the latter expressed satisfaction over it.
It transpired that the CCTV camera of the building was not working when the fire broke out and its footage was also not available with surrounding buildings as their cameras were not covering the venue. The police investigator said the wooden switchboard was the starting point of the fire as its surrounding and doors and windows had received serious blows.
Mr David said, “We are living in complete harmony like a family and would not allow any foreign enemy to exploit this situation and spoil the interfaith harmony. We have full confidence in our government and police authorities who are providing security and safety to minorities.”

This call came in tandem with the imminent commencement of negotiations on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Agreement and the crucial budget planning for 2024-25.
Country Head ofCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (CTFK) Malik Imran Ahmad said reduced tobacco consumption, improved health outcomes, and enhanced revenue streams were the interconnected.
He affirmed that prioritising tobacco taxation in the forthcoming budget would not only safeguard public health but help in achieving its fiscal targets.
To Propel Health and Economy Forward, Ahmad advocated for an increase of 26.6pc Federal Excise Duty (FED) on cigarettes, a move projected to recuperate 19.8pc of healthcare expenditures associated with smoking-related diseases.
He emphasised that the measure aligned with the impending IMF agreement negotiations, contributing substantially to revenue generation crucial for budgetary allocations.
In his statement, he further highlighted that the government would benefit from increased revenue from tobacco products, potentially averting the need for an increase in petrol prices and subsequent rises in commodity prices. This strategic approach would provide much-needed relief to the public amidst economic challenges.
Dr. Khalil Ahmad Dogar, Programme Manager at SPARC, stressed the pivotal role of increased cigarette taxes in deterring tobacco use among youth and low-income individuals. He reiterated that higher prices served as effective deterrents, particularly for price-sensitive demographics such as youth and the low-income population.
He urged the government to leverage tobacco taxation not only to curb smoking initiation among youth but also to fortify public health initiatives and healthcare services.
Dr Dogar emphasised that policymakers must fulfill their electoral promises by taking decisive action against the tobacco industry.

Speaking at an Iftar hosted by the embassy on Tuesday, which coincided with the Nowruz festival, the Iranian ambassador said despite the sanctions, both countries had witnessed progress and development in various fields, including economic, security and trade.
“Great progress has been made in various fields of cooperation including cultural, scientific, defence and security,” Dr Moghadam said, adding that the opening of two official border crossings after 73 years had increased electricity export to Pakistan from 100MW to more than 200MW. This, he added, was likely to increase to 500MW.
The ambassador said trade volume had reached $2.5 billion, adding that capacities of the commonalities and links in various areas of history, civilisation, language, religion, geography and culture should be availed for sustainable development.
He went on to say that the propaganda machinery of some western-biased media was spreading disinformation, misinformation and mal-information about Iran and Pakistan. However, he lauded Pakistani media for their professionalism, engagement and ethics, and also paid tributes to those journalists who had sacrificed their lives while promoting justice, truth, peace and love around the world.
The gathering also observed silence in memory of media people who made great sacrifices in the war in Gaza and highlighted the crimes and genocidal acts being committed by the Zionist regime.
The Iranian envoy said the Israeli regime was committing genocide and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip as a result of which thousands of innocent children, women and men had been martyred or injured while buildings and infrastructure in Gaza had been ruined.

“The sea of people will play a key role not only in securing the release of Pakistan’s undisputed leader, Imran Khan but also in serving as a referendum against the recent electoral malpractice,” he said in a meeting of PTI workers here.
Anticipating the participation of a significant number of people from AJK, Mr Bashir vowed that his committee would make all possible efforts to facilitate the Kashmiri aficionados of PTI activities in all possible ways.
Underscoring the importance of the public meeting, he said it was a right and timely decision to send a loud and clear message across the globe that notwithstanding unrelenting coercive measures by the state the PTI remained the most popular political party of Pakistan.
Mr Bashir asserted that since the PTI believed in the people’s power, it would achieve its aims and objective through the same power, rather than any “unholy deals.”
“Eventually, the people of Pakistan will emerge triumphant in the struggle for the establishment of their right to form a government of their choice,” he said.
Alluding to the resilience of PTI workers, he maintained that time had proved that jail terms, court trials, arrests and punishments had failed to break the resolve of the PTI loyalists, just like that of their formidable leader.
“When the people rise, the artificial powers crumble like the walls of sand.”
Mr Bashir claimed that the incarcerated PTI founding chairman was reflecting the sentiments and aspirations of the entire nation which had always passionately responded to his calls.
“The April 6 public meeting will determine a new direction of politics and subsequently culminate in the emergence of a great and real democratic Pakistan,” he said.

10,Pakistan urged to emulate Saudi e-governance model,Experts say success is outcome of Saudi vision to create a backbone of data and disseminate it in national mainstream.,"ISLAMABAD: Speakers at a conference here discussed the successful e-governance model of Saudi Arabia and how Pakistan could emulate it. 
The conference on e-governance in Saudi Arabia and opportunities and lessons for Pakistan was held on Tuesday at Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI). 
The objective of the conference arranged in collaboration with World Echo WE News was how Pakistan could emulate the successful e-governance model of Saudi Arabia that had not only transformed the Saudi society as a whole becoming more inclusive but had also sped up public services dislodging the bureaucratic hurdles.
Dr Babar Majid Bhatti, CEO National Information Technology Board (NITB), was the chief guest. 

Experts say success is outcome of Saudi vision to create a backbone of data and disseminate it in national mainstream

He said Saudi Arabia is number one on the index of countries who have transformed after starting from scratch in 2017. This primarily is an outcome of its vision to create a backbone of data and disseminate it in the national mainstream.
He also said the industry was looking for catalysts and transformers and not those who can sit on the problem by evaluating academic debates. Some of the great accomplishments that came the Saudi way are National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA), a monolithic landscape of development intended to tap the best of talent, and the highest level of commitment from the leadership.
The speakers said Saudi Arabia with a population of around 40 million had made great strides in information technology and its desire to digitise the society had transformed it within a span of less than a decade.
While drawing parallels, it was noted that though Pakistan possesses some of the great talent and industrious initiatives it was lack of digital foundations that ailed it.
Retired vice admiral Khan Hasham bin Saddique, who also served as an envoy in Saudi Arabia, said 85 per cent of Saudi society had access to e-governance and more than 50pc of its revenue was from non-oil resources.
The participants said Pakistan’s fundamental problem was lack of facilities to opt for digital financial transactions.
IPRI President Dr Raza Mohammad, Director Research retired Brig Dr Raashid Wali Janjua, and WE News Director Ammar Masood also participated in the dialogue. They said a state-sponsored policy to facilitate private sector was the need of the hour in order to harness the best of potential that Pakistan possesses and streamline the same into e-governance. It was also noted that e-procurement can cut down 60pc of transaction cost and boost efficiency. The reason why Saudi Arabia has progressed is that it has taken out red-tapism from its bureaucracy and evolved it on a format of ease-governance.

Dr. Nosheen Kazmi, Associate Consultant in Psychiatry and Lead Autism Services, highlighted the importance of awareness of autism and how these individuals can be included in society.
Dr. Mehboob Yaqub, Consultant Psychiatrist and Section Head, emphasised that unidentified autism in adults has a significant adverse impact on the lives of individuals, their loved ones, and their interactions in professional environments. He stated that a better understanding of autism during childhood can help families plan their lives more smoothly, ultimately resulting in better contributions to society.
Kashif Khan, Associate General Manager of the Rehabilitation Department, appreciated the role of behavioural therapists, speech therapists, and occupational therapists who spend a lot of time assisting autistic individuals in managing their condition.

He was meeting Michael Galway and Hamid Jafri of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, who called on him to discuss Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to eradicate the Polio virus.
The meeting, attended by Federal Secretary Iftikhar Ali Shallwani and DG Health NHS, underscored the crucial partnership between Pakistan and Gates Foundation in combating poliovirus.
According to a statement, during the meeting, Gates Foundation officials highlighted their close engagement with the Pakistan government on polio eradication. They said that Pakistan had made significant progress against the crippling disease.
Malik Mukhtar Ahmed said that 2024 was a pivotal year in the journey for making Pakistan polio free by 2026.
Coordinator to Prime Minister threw light on the challenges raised by population movements across the border with Afghanistan, the main reason of the recent outbreaks in certain areas. He stressed the necessity for a result-oriented dialogue between Afghanistan and Pakistan to effectively combat the poliovirus.
Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmed also announced plans for a conference next month, bringing together stakeholders from all provinces to identify and address any existing loopholes in the eradication strategy.
Health secretary told the officials of Gates Foundation that the ministry was working on engaging local administrations to bridge communication gaps and engage communities in vulnerable areas. He highlighted the importance of community participation in achieving the shared goal of a polio-free Pakistan.
Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus mainly affecting children under the age of five years. It invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis or even death. While there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this crippling disease. Each time a child under the age of five is vaccinated, their protection against the virus is increased. Repeated immunisations have protected millions of children from polio, allowing almost all countries in the world to become polio-free, except for the two endemic countries of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
