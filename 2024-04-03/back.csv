0,"Nine dead in Taiwan's strongest earthquake in 25 years, 50 missing","Quake hits 15.5km deep, triggering tsunami warning for Japan and the Philippines, later lifted","Taiwan's biggest earthquake in at least 25 years killed nine people on Wednesday, injuring more than 900, while 50 hotel workers were missing en route to a national park, authorities said, as rescuers used ladders to bring others to safety.
Television broadcast images of buildings tilted at precarious angles in the mountainous, sparsely populated eastern county of Hualien, near the epicentre of the 7.2 magnitude quake, which struck just offshore at about 8 a.m. (0000GMT).
""It was very strong. It felt as if the house was going to topple,"" said Chang Yu-lin, 60, a worker in a hospital in Taipei, the capital.
A woman who runs bed-and-breakfast accommodation in Hualien city said she scrambled to calm her guests who were frightened by the quake.
""This is the biggest earthquake I have ever experienced,"" said the woman, who asked to be identified only by her family name, Chan.

The quake hit at a depth of 15.5 km (9.6 miles), just as people were headed for work and school, setting off a tsunami warning for southern Japan and the Philippines that was later lifted.
The video showed rescuers using ladders to help trapped people out of windows, while elsewhere there were massive landslides. Strong tremors in Taipei forced the subway system to close briefly, although most lines resumed service.
Fire authorities said they had already evacuated some 70 people trapped in tunnels near Hualien city, including two Germans.
But they had lost contact with 50 workers aboard four minibuses heading to a hotel in a national park, Taroko Gorge, they said, and rescuers were looking for them. Another 80 people are trapped in a mining area, though it was not immediately clear if they were inside a mine.
The government put the number of injured at 946.

""At present the most important thing, the top priority, is to rescue people,"" said President-elect Lai Ching-te, speaking outside one of the collapsed buildings in Hualien.
The rail link to the area was expected to re-open on Thursday, Lai, who is set to take office next month, told reporters.
Taiwan's air force said six F-16 fighter jets had been slightly damaged at a major base in the city from which jets are often scrambled to see off incursions by China's air force, but the aircraft are expected to return to service very soon.
In Japan, the weather agency put the quake's magnitude at 7.7, saying several small tsunami waves reached parts of the southern prefecture of Okinawa, while downgrading its tsunami warning to an advisory.

In the Philippines, seismology officials warned coastal residents in several provinces to move to higher ground.
Chinese state media said the quake was felt in the southeastern province of Fujian, while a Reuters witness said it was also felt in the commercial hub of Shanghai.
Aftershocks could still be felt in Taipei, with more than 50 recorded, weather officials said.
Most power has been restored after the quake, electricity utility Taipower said, with the island's two nuclear power stations unaffected.
Taiwan's high-speed rail operator said no damage or injuries were reported on its trains, although services would be delayed as it made inspections.
A major supplier of chips to Apple (AAPL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), said it had evacuated some fabrication plants and safety systems were operating normally.

Firefighters work at the site where a building collapsed following the earthquake, in Hualien, Taiwan, on April 3, 2024.
""To ensure the safety of personnel, some fabs were evacuated according to company procedure,"" the semiconductor giant said in a statement, adding later that the employees had begun to return to work.
TSMC's Taipei-listed shares ended down 1.3%, but the benchmark index (.TWII) largely brushed off the quake's impact to close down 0.6%.
The official central news agency said the quake was the biggest since one of magnitude 7.6 in 1999 that killed about 2,400 people and damaged or destroyed 50,000 buildings.
Taiwan weather officials ranked Wednesday's quake in Hualien as ""Upper 6"", or the second-highest level of intensity on a scale ranging from 1 to 7.
Such quakes collapse walls unless they are made of reinforced concrete blocks, while people cannot stand upright and must crawl in order to move, experts say.

1,White House directs NASA to create time standard for the moon,"Without a unified lunar time standard, it would be challenging to ensure that data transfers between spacecraft, OSTP","The White House on Tuesday directed NASA to establish a unified standard of time for the moon and other celestial bodies, as the United States aims to set international norms in space amid a growing lunar race among nations and private companies.
The head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), according to a memo seen by Reuters, instructed the space agency to work with other parts of the U.S. government to devise a plan by the end of 2026 for setting what it called a Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC).
The differing gravitational force, and potentially other factors, on the moon and other celestial bodies change how time unfolds relative to how it is perceived on Earth. Among other things, the LTC would provide a time-keeping benchmark for lunar spacecraft and satellites that require extreme precision for their missions.
""The same clock that we have on Earth would move at a different rate on the moon,"" Kevin Coggins, NASA's space communications and navigation chief, said in an interview.
OSTP chief Arati Prabhakar's memo said that for a person on the moon, an Earth-based clock would appear to lose on average 58.7 microseconds per Earth day and come with other periodic variations that would further drift moon time from Earth time.
""Think of the atomic clocks at the US Naval Observatory (in Washington). They're the heartbeat of the nation, synchronizing everything. You're going to want a heartbeat on the moon,"" Coggins said.
Under its Artemis program, NASA is aiming to send astronaut missions to the moon in the coming years and establish a scientific lunar base that could help set the stage for future missions to Mars. Dozens of companies, spacecraft and countries are involved in the effort.
An OSTP official said that without a unified lunar time standard, it would be challenging to ensure that data transfers between spacecraft are secure and that communications between Earth, lunar satellites, bases and astronauts are synchronized.
Discrepancies in time also could lead to errors in mapping and locating positions on or orbiting the moon, the official said.
'How disruptive'
""Imagine if the world wasn't syncing their clocks to the same time - how disruptive that might be and how challenging everyday things become,"" the official said.
On Earth, most clocks and time zones are based on Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC. This internationally recognized standard relies on a vast global network of atomic clocks placed in different locations around the world. They measure changes in the state of atoms and generate an average that ultimately makes up a precise time.
Deployment of atomic clocks on the lunar surface may be needed, according to the OSTP official.
The official also said that as commercial activities expand to the moon, a unified time standard would be essential for coordinating operations, ensuring the reliability of transactions and managing the logistics of lunar commerce.
NASA in January said it has scheduled for September 2026 its first astronaut lunar landing since the end of the Apollo program in the 1970s, with a mission flying four astronauts around the moon and back scheduled for September 2025.
While the United States is the only country to have put astronauts on the moon, others have lunar ambitions. Countries have their eyes on potential mineral resources on the moon, and lunar bases could help support future crewed missions to Mars and elsewhere.
China said last year it aims to put its first astronauts on the moon by 2030. Japan in January became the fifth country to put a spacecraft on the moon. India last year became the first country to land a spacecraft near the unexplored lunar south pole, and it has announced plans to send an astronaut to the moon by 2040.
""US leadership in defining a suitable standard - one that achieves the accuracy and resilience required for operating in the challenging lunar environment - will benefit all spacefaring nations,"" the OSTP memo stated.
Defining how to implement Coordinated Lunar Time will require international agreements, the memo said, through ""existing standards bodies"" and among the 36 nations that have signed a pact called the Artemis Accords involving how countries act in space and on the moon. China and Russia, the two main US rivals in space, have not signed the Artemis Accords.
Coordinated Universal Time might influence how Coordinated Lunar Time is implemented, the OSTP official said. The UN's International Telecommunication Union defines Coordinated Universal Time as an international standard.

2,IHC throws out ministry report on X ban,Orders interior secretary to appear in person on April 17,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday dismissed a report submitted by the Ministry of Interior regarding the closure of X—formerly Twitter—in Pakistan.
The court instructed the interior secretary to personally appear on April 17 and provide concrete evidence of the alleged threat posed by X to national security.
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq presided over a petition filed by a citizen against the ban imposed on X in February during the tenure of a caretaker government.
During the court session, the joint-secretary of the interior stated that X was shut down in Pakistan based on a report submitted by the Intelligence Bureau (IB).
According to the report, the content uploaded on X and other social media platforms was deemed a threat to national security, he said.

Expressing dissatisfaction with the report, Justice Farooq remarked that it was merely speculative. ""What is this [report]? Even my secretary could produce a better one,"" he commented.
He then questioned the joint-secretary about the content of the court order.
""Should I state that the government is too fatigued to address this matter and fulfill its obligations? It appears that every institution is tainted.""
The court observed that the government had closed down X based on a speculative report. The bench emphasized that authorities must present solid evidence, even if the content on X is indeed a security risk to the state.
The interior secretary was directed to personally appear on April 17 and elucidate the reasons for the closure of the popular platform.
The Ministry of Interior was also instructed to submit relevant court orders regarding the lifting of the ban on X. ""Let's see who takes the initiative to lift this ban,"" Justice Farooq concluded.

In compliance with the court's previous order regarding informing it of the measures taken for Imran's security, AGP Khalid Ishaq shared that the ex-premier has been allocated seven cells, and 14 security personnel, as opposed to one security official per 10 prisoners. Two officers are deployed around the clock.
He further stated that the cells have been sealed for anyone’s movement, and special CCTV cameras have also been installed for 24-hour surveillance. The premier is fed a special meal, prepared in a special kitchen, the AGP said.
The judge inquired if Imran’s meals were examined by doctors, to which the AGP replied in the affirmative. “Jail superintendent and doctors examine the meal before it is served,” he said.

4,PHC CJ sees bias in elevation of judges to SC,Pens letter to CJ over ‘non-consideration of his name,"Peshawar High Court (PHC) Chief Justice Muhammad Ibrahim Khan on Wednesday expressed concern over non-consideration of his name for the elevation of judges to the Supreme Court from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province.
In a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, Chief Justice Khan wrote that he was the second senior-most high court chief justice in Pakistan. He expressed his disappointment that his candidacy was not even considered despite his seniority and eligibility for vacancies in the apex court.
Currently, there are four vacancies of judges in the Supreme Court. Recently, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) recommended the elevation of Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan to the apex court.
“It was a profound disappointment when I learnt that only one judge and that too from your own province, was appointed in the Supreme Court despite the fact that there were four vacancies,” the PHC chief justice wrote in the letter.
“I am genuinely happy for my brother Mr Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan but why my candidacy was not considered notwithstanding my seniority, eligibility and availability of vacancies in the Supreme Court,” he added.

Chief Justice Ibrahim Khan said that he was writing to the letter with “a sense of disillusionment in relation to prima facie arbitrariness, discrimination and favouritism in the appointment of judges” in the Supreme Court.
“I had legitimate expectation that my candidature would be at least included in the list for consideration to be appointed as a Judge of the Supreme Court,” he said. “Had I not been found fit to be appointed as Judge of Supreme Court after due process by [JCP], I would have happily accepted the JCP’s decision.”
The PHC chief justice believed that considering the substantial backlog, Chief Justice Isa might feel inclined or even obligated to promptly fill the vacancies in the apex court, particularly given the sentiment among the countrymen that they were being deprived of swift justice.
“The taxpayers, who pay for our salaries, expect that vacancies are filled immediately so that the court may operate at full strength and dispense justice. There is a duty to act diligently. This decision of solitary appointment has left me perplexed and seeking genuine answers, he continued.

Chief Justice Ibrahim Khan also pointed out that at present, there were three judges in the Supreme Court from Balochistan, while only two belonged to Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Comparing the two provinces on any analogy, he added, there would be one more vacancy for the K-P province.
“Unfortunately, I lack the personal connections that often play a role in such elevations. This lack of advocacy or lobbying on my behalf should not be a deterrent to recognising the merit and the commitment that I have demonstrated towards upholding justice,” the PHC chief justice stressed.
He explained that the purpose of writing the letter was not to directly challenge the decision made, but rather to seek clarification and assurance that the principles of merit, fairness, and equality of opportunity were being maintained.

7,Vawda proves his politics is above parties,Former minister elected as senator from Sindh,"Former federal minister Faisal Vawda on Tuesday was elected a senator despite standing as an independent.
Even though Vawda was not present in the Sindh Assembly during the polls for the upper house of parliament, the PPP and MQM-P succeeded in bagging him the slot of a senator.
Vawda entered the political landscape of the country as a PTI activist in 2011. In the 2018 general elections, he defeated PML-N’s Shehbaz Sharif to become an MNA. Vawda was elected to the National Assembly from the Constituency NA-249 (Karachi West-II) as a candidate of PTI in the 2018 general elections.
During the tenure of the PTI government, he served as the federal water resources minister. However, he developed differences with the PTI in 2022 over the murder of journalist Arshad Sharif and the party’s long march.
He was elected as a senator after winning in the 2021 Senate elections on a seat from Sindh and held the seat until February 2022.

8,QESCO upped circular debt by 96% this year: NEPRA,Regulator chides PESCO for long hours of announced load shedding,"The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has observed that the Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco) had increased the circular debt by 96% this year and if it was included in the amount of Rs236 billion it sought, the loss became even greater.
The power regulator concluded its hearing of the application for the sum of Rs236 billion the electricity distribution company had asked for from its customers for the year 2024-25.
During the hearing, the Nepra chairman inquired how loss would be incurred if Qesco’s financial needs were not met.
The Qesco officials told the power regulator that 70% of its electricity is consumed by the agricultural sector.
They added that the rate of receipts from the agricultural sector was only 1.9%.
They complained that the law enforcement agencies were not assisting the power company in recovering its dues.
The Qesco officials further raised the question that what would happen to their arrears if the government introduced solar power in the areas under their jurisdiction.
They claimed that the tubewells in Kharan district that were shifted to solar energy were still using their network.
Nepra also concluded the hearing of the Peshawar Electric Power Company’s (Pesco) application seeking a sum of Rs67.07 billion from its consumers for the year 2024-25.
The power regulator’s member Rafique Ahmed Shaikh said Pesco’s performance could be gauged from three factors alone. He pointed out that Pesco had the highest number of fatal accidents -- 18.
Secondly, he noted that Pesco had led in terms of power outages against other companies.
“Pesco is subjecting its consumers to 11 hours of announced load shedding,” he added.
The Nepra member further inquired how was it possible that there were only 48 faulty meters in the whole jurisdiction of Pesco.
The Pesco officials told Nepra that they were facing a great deal of difficulties because of the hike in petrol and diesel prices.
They added that fuel price increase had forced their vehicles to almost come to a standstill.
The Pesco officials further maintained that their industrial demand had fallen by 18%.
Nepra member Mathar Niaz Rana asked them who would buy electricity from them it they sold it at such expensive rates.
