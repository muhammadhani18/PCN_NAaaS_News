0,Excavation of Ganweriwala paused,Archaeological project scheduled to recommence on October 15,"The excavation work in Ganweriwala, a city larger than Harappa and home to the ancient Indus civilisation in the Cholistan desert, has been paused due to the increasing temperature and unavailability of local workers.
The remnants of Ganweriwala, located 60km from the Derawar Fort, were discovered in 1975 by Dr Muhammad Rafiq Mughal, a former director general of Punjab Archaeology Department.
However, excavation efforts were hindered by insufficient resources, water scarcity and a manpower shortage near the site.
The excavation project was initiated on February 24 under the leadership of Dr Mughal.
The archaeology department, in collaboration with the THAAP heritage organization and the commissioner of Bahawalpur, played a major role in the project’s initiation. Dr Sajda Vandal, the Head of the THAAP Heritage Project, also participated in the process.
A team of 50 professionals, including senior experts from the department, three women archaeologists, students of the archaeology departments in government universities, cameramen and security staff, participated in excavating the 7,000-year-old relics.
Former archaeology director Afzal Khan told The Express Tribune that with the onset of the wheat harvesting season in the area, the local labourers, who had undergone training for digging, had returned to their homes.
New workers were brought in, but they needed to undergo training.
Additionally, the temperature had begun to increase in the area. With a majority of the workers fasting, the initial phase of excavation has been halted.
The excavation is scheduled to recommence on October 15.
Khan added that the 35-day excavation had produced noteworthy findings, uncovering distinct zones dedicated to both settlement and commercial activities.
Experts maintain that the city served as a prominent centre of the Indus Valley Civilisation from 2600 to 1900BC.
The survey findings reveal that the inhabitants of Ganweriwala possessed remarkable proficiency in the craft of bead making, as evidenced by the collected artefacts.
Additionally, they exhibited great skill in various handicrafts, such as pottery and sculpting. Experts claim there are about 500 archaeological sites in the Cholistan desert, the most important of which is Ganweriwala.

1,Wildlife Rescue Force planned in Punjab,"Equipped units to consist of trained personnel, ambulances, doctors and rescue vehicles","The Punjab government has decided to establish a Wildlife Rescue Force which will consist of trained personnel, veterinary ambulances, doctors and rescue vehicles.
In the first phase, wildlife rescue units will be established in Lahore, Khanewal and Rawalpindi.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, has urged legislation regarding the possession of tigers, leopards and wild cats under the Wildlife Act.
The senior minister announced that a Bengal tiger being taken privately from Lahore to Multan had been rescued.
She also said that lectures and seminars were organised in schools and colleges at the district level across Punjab to educate the new generation and the general public about the conservation and survival of wildlife.
According to the amended Wildlife Act, 1973, citizens who keep animals illegally must be detained and heavily fined.
During a recent combing operation against illegal possession of wild animals in Sargodha, Nankana Sahib, Bahawalpur, Muzaffargarh, Gujranwala and DG Khan, 11 rare black bears, 96 parrots, 20 monkeys, 85 sparrows, six chakors, 35 pheasants, 45 partridges and 25 peacocks were seized in 10 days.
The minister confirmed that all these animals were being kept temporarily in different zoos to later be released in the wild.
She added, “Many of these animals have become rare in the world, so their protection is the duty of every human being. No one will be allowed to detain or torture animals illegally. The true habitat of the wild animal is forests and other natural habitats. Illegal confinement of wild animals and birds is a legal offence.”

2,Women defy odds in Lahore conservation,Conservation scientists transforming cultural restoration,"Young women are at the forefront of efforts to conserve and restore the historical Picture Wall, Sheesh Mahal at Lahore Fort and Wazir Khan Mosque, ensuring the preservation of these architectural marvels for future generations.
Many of these dedicated individuals, primarily fine arts graduates and conservation scientists, are engaged in this task under the banner of Agha Khan Cultural Services Pakistan (AKCSP), with some serving as interns for a US-funded initiative.
The focal point of their endeavours is the restoration of the 17th-century Mughal-era Picture Wall, a monumental structure spanning over 1600 feet on the northern section of Lahore Fort.
After years of neglect, these young enthusiasts are working tirelessly to revive the intricate frescoes adorning the wall, breathing new life into its decaying splendour.
Ayesha, one of the interns in the US-funded programme, emphasised the significance of their work not only for the present but also for future generations.
She expressed her conviction that the architectural heritage from the Mughal, Sikh, and British periods would be a source of awe and inspiration for posterity. For Ayesha and her peers, the internship has provided a unique opportunity to delve into history and contribute to its preservation.
Kinza, a graduate of the National College of Arts (NCA), shared her experience of the challenges and rewards of working on scaffolding for extended hours. Her responsibilities include cleaning and conserving frescoes and mosaics, ensuring the preservation of every intricate detail.
Overseeing the restoration work at Wazir Khan Mosque is Meena Arham, a seasoned conservation scientist who has dedicated over a decade to this project.
She coordinates with interns, architects, and labourers, overseeing the meticulous restoration efforts.
Meena expressed gratitude to Agha Khan for providing her with the platform to lead such impactful initiatives.
She also highlighted the importance of challenging the male-dominated narrative within the realm of mosque restoration.
At the Sheesh Mahal restoration project within Lahore Fort, another conservation scientist Zeina Naseer, navigates the predominantly male labour force with confidence and expertise. Despite the occasional challenges, Zeina remains undeterred in her commitment to preserving heritage.
She acknowledged the AKCSP for offering her the opportunity to contribute to a project that allows others to experience the past firsthand.
The presence of young women in traditionally male-dominated conservation projects symbolises a shift towards inclusivity and gender equality.
Their dedication and expertise serve as a testament to the notion that women can excel in any field, breaking barriers and paving the way for future generations.
Through their collective efforts, these remarkable individuals are ensuring that the rich tapestry of history remains intact for generations to come.

3,PML-N’s Sindhu gets more than coalition votes,provincial minister manages to garner a record-breaking 253 votes,"Provincial Minister Khalil Tahir Sindhu, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidate for the minority seat of the Senate in Punjab, defied expectations by securing five more votes than the total votes of the ruling coalition.
Despite the ruling alliance boasting 248 members in the Punjab Assembly, Sindhu managed to garner a record-breaking 253 votes, including five votes from members of the Sunni Ittehad Council.
Sindhu's extensive involvement as Minister of Parliamentary Affairs in the Punjab Assembly, coupled with his amicable relations with certain opposition members, played a pivotal role in securing additional votes from unexpected quarters.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Aurangzeb also exceeded expectations by obtaining four extra votes for the technocrat seat of the Senate.
However, the tides turned for Federal Minister for Petroleum Mussadiq Malik, who lost three votes on the second seat of the Technocrat. Initial projections anticipated Finance Minister Aurangzeb and Mussadiq Malik to receive votes from 124 members each, but Malik fell short with only 121 votes. Similarly, Bushra Anjum Butt lost one vote on the women's seat.
The Pakistan Peoples Party's (PPP) 15 votes proved instrumental in ensuring success for the PML-N on the technocrat and women's seats.
In light of the potential risk of party members voting against their respective party's directives, the opposition decided to partake in the Senate elections unopposed, further shaping the dynamics of the voting process.

4,WASA moves for pipeline replacement,Pilot project to be initiated in Johar Town,"Because of paucity of funds, the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) has decided to replace the sewerage and water supply lines in the city under its Master Plan 2050 in phases.
The plan is aimed at building water tanks, supplying clean water to the citizens round the clock and provide better sewerage facilities. However, the water connections will be metered and billed accordingly.
According to officials, the pilot project for replacing the pipelines will be launched in Johor Town, which will initially cover 200 residential and commercial areas.
The city has been divided into 140 zones for implementing the master plan.
The officials said the water and sewerage pipelines laid in Lahore a long time ago had completed their viable age. Because of the dilapidated pipelines, residents of most parts of the city complain of being supplied unclean water.
In view of the funding constraints, temporary replacement and repair of the pipelines was carried out at some places, but the problems kept increasing.
A survey conducted by WASA for laying the new sewerage and water supply lines across the city showed that it would cost billions of rupees.
The Punjab government is not in a position to provide the civic agency such a huge amount.
In view of the situation, WASA has launched a short-term project. The civic agency has proposed to reduce the areas under its control under the master plan. The area has been divided into nine towns and 140 zones.
The project will be implemented in phases.
The sources said the replacement of the pipelines in Johar Town had been designated as a pilot project, which will initially cover 200 residential and commercial areas.
All sewerage and water supply lines in the areas will be replaced and large water tanks will also be built.
After the completion of the project, drinking water will be available to the residents of the areas round the clock. At present, the citizens get water supply three times a day for 10 hours.
The pilot project also includes the installation of water meters at every residential and commercial premises so that the consumption can be billed proportionately.
A state-of-the-art system will be installed by WASA, under which the water will be released from the tube wells, reach the tanks and from there it will reach homes and commercial consumers. The whole flow will be fully accounted for.
The officials expect that with the termination of illegal connections, the complaints of water theft will also decrease.
The pilot project will initially cost more than Rs120 million.
After the success of the pilot project, the plan will be implemented in other areas as the funds are provided.
The master plan is aimed at providing clean water and sewerage facilities to the citizens in a phased manner throughout the city.
The final approval of the project will be given by the Punjab government.
WASA Managing Director Ghufran Ahmed said the underground sewerage and water supply lines in the city were very old but despite this the agency was providing the services by utilising the available resources.
He said a huge amount was required to replace the sewerage and supply lines across the city. It is difficult for the provincial government to immediately release the required funds, so a phased project has been planned.
As soon as the project is approved by the Punjab government and the funds are available, WASA will start the work, the official added, stressing that the problems of providing clean water and sewerage facilities to the citizens would be solved.
