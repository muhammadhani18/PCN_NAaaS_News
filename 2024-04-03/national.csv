0,Balochistan speaker loses post after ECP orders re-polling,Assembly officials say speaker’s election would be held after re-election at the 12 contested polling stations.,"QUETTA: The Baloch­i­stan Assembly’s speaker, Abdul Khaliq Achakzai of the PML-N, has been removed from his position following the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to suspend his election notification and order re-election in 12 polling stations within the provincial constituency PB-51 (Chaman).
The directive for the re-election came after a challenge to Mr Khaliq’s victory by three contenders: Muhammad Asghar Ach­akzai of the Awami Natio­nal Party (ANP), Abasin Achakzai, and Muham­m­­ad Sadiq, all of whom were defeated in the general ele­­ction for the PB-51 seat.
However, the trio petitioned the Election Com­mission against the win of Mr Khaliq, who contested as a joint candidate of the PML-N and PPP.
A two-member ECP be­­n­ch — comprising Nisar Ahmad Durrani and Ba­­bar Hussain — heard the petitions filed by the op­­posing candidates. They called for re-polling at specified polling stations and subsequently suspended Mr Khaliq’s official victory notification, the commission said in a statement.
According to the Election Commission, the re-election will be held at polling stations 56, 57, 61, 62, 79, 89, 90, 91, 95, 106, 129 and 130 of the PB-51 constituency.
Meanwhile, Balochistan Assembly officials said that after the ECP’s decision about re-polling, Kha­liq Achakzai had been de­­prived of the Balochis­tan Assembly speaker’s post.
“Khaliq Achakzai is no longer speaker of the Balo­chistan Assembly,” the as­­sembly officials said, adding that the speaker’s election would be held after the re-election at the 12 contested polling stations.

1,"26 of 38 federal secretaries hail from Punjab, NA told","20 officers in grade 18 or above hold dual nationality, Establishment Division reveals.","ISLAMABAD: Out of 38 serving federal secretaries, 26 belong to Punjab alone, while there is not a single official at the highest level of the bureaucracy at the federal level who hails from Balochistan.
Moreover, there are 20 officers of grade 18 and above at the federal level who have obtained dual nationality.
This information was placed before the National Assembly by the government in response to questions asked by MNAs during Monday’s sitting, which could not be taken up due to the strong PTI protest against the government’s act of not allowing them to hold a debate on the issue of a letter written by six Islamabad High Court judges to the Supreme Judicial Council.
In a written reply to a question asked by PPP’s Shehla Raza, the minister in charge of the Establishment Division provided a complete list of the federal secretaries with their domiciles.

20 officers in grade 18 or above hold dual nationality, Estab Division reveals

The data shows that out of 38 federal secretaries, 26 belong to Punjab, followed by seven from rural Sindh, three from urban Sindh and two from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The minister stated that no quota has been reserved for the provinces with regard to posting/appointment of federal secretaries.
It may be recalled that the lawmakers from Balochistan have been regularly protesting in the National Assembly and Senate over alleged victimisation of the officers from the province and non-fulfillment of the job quota.
In response to another question asked by Rana Ansar of the MQM-P, the government informed the assembly that there were 20 officers working in grade 18 and above who possessed the citizenship of other countries. The data shows that 10 officials are the UK nationals whereas six of them have obtained the nationality of Canada and four of them are the US nationals.
Though there has been no bar on the bureaucrats holding dual nationality, there has been a call from some segments of society that no dual national should be allowed key position in the government as there is a bar on the politicians, judges and military officers.

2,FIA on the case after PIA cabin crew charged in Canada,RAWALPINDI: The Federal Investigation Age­ncy (FIA) has asked the management of the natio­nal flag carrier to ...,"RAWALPINDI: The Federal Investigation Age­ncy (FIA) has asked the management of the natio­nal flag carrier to share details of a case involving a member of the PIA cabin crew, who has been detained by Cana­dian authorities for carrying contraband items, a senior PIA official told Dawn.
Hina Sani, a member of the PIA crew on a Lahore-Toronto flight, was detai­ned last week for allegedly carrying passports of unrelated  persons, an immigration stamp and a contraband item allegedly concealed  in her shoes.
She is likely to be produced before a Canadian court on Wednesday.Sources said the PIA management had expanded its own investigation into the issue by including the crew scheduler and deputy general manager (flight services) who had authorised her to travel to Canada.
She was detained along with two other crew members who were also on duty on the PIA flight PK-789. While her colleagues were freed, Hina was grilled for three hours before the Canadian authorities fina­lised a charge sheet and converted her detention into a formal arrest, sources said.
The PIA management, sources say, is trying to stay informed about the case while staying away from any legal proceedings.
Canadian authorities are said to have formally informed her family about the charges against Ms Sani, who are currently in the process of hiring legal counsel in Toronto to obtain her interim bail.
She may be deported and blacklisted, or kept in jail until the conclusion of the case, sources said.
The PIA management has already suspended the cabin crew member from active service, and its central disciplinary unit has obtained the statements of the crew members who were detained alongside Ms Sani.
PIA spokesman Abdul­lah Hafeez confirmed Ms Sani’s arrest in Toronto and said the management in Toronto was keeping an eye on developments in her case. He said the airline was also in discussions to send a high-profile team to Canada to formalise preventive measures, to be put in place with the support of Canadian authorities.

3,Tyrian White case likely to  resume after Eid,Matter has been shelved since May 2023 since IHC CJ dissolved a three-member bench hea­r­­­ing the case.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) is likely to take up after Eid a petition filed against former prime minister Imran Khan for concealing his alleged daughter Tyrian White, according to court officials.
The matter has been virtually shelved since May 2023, when the IHC chief justice dissolved a three-member bench hea­r­­­ing the case after the opinions of two jud­ges regarding the petition’s maintainability were uploaded on the court’s website.
A three-judge larger bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, and Jus­tice Arbab Muhammad Tahir had reserved its verdict on March 30, while Justices Kayani and Tahir had opined against the petition’s maintainability,
After the majority judgement was made public, the IHC CJ formed a new bench comprising Justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Arbab Mohammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz.
As per the IHC rules, the senior-most judge presides over the proceedings in a case and the registrar’s office fixes hearings with the presiding judge’s consent.
A senior IHC official told Dawn that the case file was sent to the presiding judge — Justice Jahangiri in this case — last year and he advised the registrar office to keep the matter pending as he was supposed to intimate the date of hearing.
The official added that the matter would be brought into the knowledge of the judge and the case was likely to be fixed for hearing after Eid holidays, starting next week.

5,Pakistan to chair UN commission,Says it views India’s extensive arms acquisitions and aggressive military policies as a threat to peace and security in South Asia.,"UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan was unanimously elected as the chair of the UN Disarmament Commission on Monday, as the world body commenced its 2024 session. 
The session follows escalating geopolitical tensions and growing apprehensions regarding the deepening mistrust among some of the world’s major military powers. 
After its election, Pakistan informed the commission that it views India’s extensive arms acquisitions and aggressive military policies as a threat to peace and security in South Asia. 
“Needless to say, these developments affect Pakistan’s security,” said Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram as the commission began its three-week session. 
The commission is a crucial arm of the UN General Assembly, responsible for making recommendations on both conventional and nuclear disarmament. At the opening of its 2024 annual session, the United Nations’ High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu warned that “the risk of a nuclear weapon being used is higher now than at any time since the height of the cold war”.

8,Imran’s lawyer asks court to disregard Azam’s testimony,"PTI founder appreciates SC suo motu on judges’ letter, says full court hearing ‘would’ve been better’.","ISLAMABAD: The counsel for former prime minister Imran Khan urged the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday to discard the testimony of the former principal secretary to PM in the cipher case, since it was ostensibly obtained under dubious circumstances.
Barrister Salman Safdar made this argument before an IHC division bench, comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, which resumed hearing on appeals filed by Mr Khan and former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi against their conviction in the cipher case.
The counsel pointed out that Azam Khan, once a close confidant of the former PM and an accused in the case, went missing in June 2023.
Then, instead of recording his confession, he testified against the ex-premier before an investigation officer and magistrate, argued Mr Safdar.

PTI founder appreciates SC suo motu on judges’ letter, says full court hearing ‘would’ve been better’

He said the case’s first information report was registered on Aug 15, 2023, and Mr Khan recorded his statement on the very next day.
The IHC bench perused the record and found that Azam Khan went missing on June 15 and re-emerged on July 20, recording his statement a month later.
Mr Safdar raised doubts about the ex-bureaucrat’s testimony, arguing that it was recorded under dubious circumstances.
Therefore, the court should not give any credence to his testimony, he argued, adding that the magistrate recorded the statement without issuing prior notice to other accused persons.
Later, the court adjourned further hearing till today (Wednesday) when Barrister Safdar would continue his arguments.
During the course of the hearing, the counsel for PTI leaders has repeatedly questioned the conduct of Mr Khan’s former principal secretary in the case.
‘Under-pressure judges’
Speaking to media persons after at­­te­n­ding proceedings in the £190 million corruption case, Mr Khan on Tuesday claimed that he was convicted by “under-pressure judges”.
Mr Khan said that accountability judge Mohammad Bashir, who convicted him in the Toshakhana reference, was under pressure and admitted to the jail hospital due to stress.
Likewise, senior civil judge Qud­rat­ul­lah has said that he could not proceed for a Walima ceremony unless the trial in the Iddat case concluded.
He welcomed the Supreme Court suo moto notice on a letter written by six ju­­dges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), who complained about interference of the intelligence agencies in judicial affairs. However, he said it would have been better if a full court heard the matter.

9,CJP stops ‘absentee petitioners’ from withdrawing media regulation plea,"Police do not seem to want to solve Matiullah Jan’s abduction case, Justice Isa observes.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Tuesday summoned six petitioners, including a former joint secretary and a former railways police chief, who had filed a joint petition seeking regulation of media freedom, but are now trying to withdraw it after a gap of two years.
“So they took the Supreme Cou­rt for a merry-go-round,” regretted Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, also
wondering where the petitioners have now disappeared.
The CJP made these remarks while heading a three-judge bench, which had taken up the Press As­­sociation of the Supreme Court’s (PAS) challenge to the “roving in­­quiries” by the Federal Investi­gation Agency (FIA) and summons being issued by a Joint Investi­ga­tion Team (JIT) on vague allegations of a so-called explicit and malicious campaign against the superior judiciary and its judges.
The bench also comprised Justice Musarrat Hilali and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan.

Police do not seem to want to solve Matiullah Jan’s abduction case, CJ Faez Isa observes

Referring to an application seeking to withdraw their 2022 joint petition, which had been filed by Advocate Haider Waheed on behalf of ex-IGP Syed Ibne Hussain from Lahore, former joint secretary Hassan Mehmood and Advocate Kosain Faisal from Islamabad, Advocate Mohammad Asif of the Chakwal Bar, Wings College Principal Prof Abrar Ahmed and senior vice chairman of International Human Rights Movement Raja Sher Bilal from Chakwal, the CJP questioned what purpose, which the petitioners wanted to achieve, has been served that they intended to withdraw the joint petition.
The CJP observed that the application claimed the petition had served its purpose in spirit, therefore, it was being withdrawn. To the contrary, Justice Isa remarked, the very opposite of what they had sought to achieve might have been partially served, which relates to press freedom.
The bench observed that when the case was called, the petitioners, their counsel and Advocate-on-Record (AoR) were neither present nor any intimation was received from them by the court.
Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan disagreed with the applicant’s argument that the federal government was looking into the matter.
The CJP said the real question was about the origins of the joint petition.
Representing PAS, senior counsel Salahuddin Ahmed argued that in public importance litigation, the petitioners did not enjoy personal discretion to withdraw their petition.
There were several instances where such petitions were filed and then the parties tried to reach settlements but the courts did not allow the withdrawal of such petitions, the counsel said.
When CJP asked if the counsel had reached any private settlement with the petitioners seeking to constraint media freedom, the counsel said the PAS opposed the grounds and the prayers made in the joint petition as they sought to limit the freedom of speech. His clients did not have much resources, nor any idea about the petitioners, he said, requesting the court to summon them.
The court observed that since none of the six petitioners were in attendance and the notice of withdrawal was served by one AoR to another, there was nothing to show they were acting on the instructions of the petitioners. In this situation, it would be appropriate to issue notices to all six petitioners with the direction to be in attendance personally on the next date of hearing, the court order stated.
When the PAS counsel also drew the attention of the SC towards a fact-finding inquiry by the Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalist (RIUJ) in the matter of harassment of journalist Matiullah Jan, the CJP noted that the impression they gathered was that the police did not want to solve it, since even the availability of a  video recording did not inspire confidence.
The AGP, however, said he would be following the matter with the interior ministry, as action was being taken on the basis of a Punjab forensic science lab report.
The court also allowed PFUJ to become party in the matter, as they were supporting the PAS petition.
Meanwhile, the AGP filed a report stating that the police had recorded the statement of journalist Shahid Maitla, who had conducted an interview of former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, where Mr Maitla said he had carried out an interview, but had no knowledge about the attempt on the life of journalist Absar Alam and harassment of Asad Toor.
During the proceedings, the CJP also regretted selective reporting, sometimes completely fabricated news and a lack of self-accountability in the media. Since it was not the court’s job to issue clarifications all the time, he mused, the apex court might have to run its own YouTube channel.

10,PTI denounces ECP ‘double standard’ over KP Senate polls delay,"Party demands Bushra Bibi’s medical check-up following claims of ""poisoning"".","ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Tuesday denounced the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to postpone the Senate polls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and called it a continuation of the “mandate theft” plot.
In a statement, a party spokesperson said the postponement of Senate elections for not administering the oath to members on reserved seats in the provincial assembly was “ridiculous” because the heads of state were also elected without members on reserved seats in national and provincial assemblies.
The statement accused the chief election commissioner of being the “central figure” in the “poll robbery” scheme.
The statement added that ECP’s decision was a continuation of the same scheme under which people’s mandate
was stolen “under state patronage” after general elections.

Party demands Bushra Bibi’s medical check-up following claims of ‘poisoning’

The PTI spokesperson alleged that a “conspiracy” was being hatched to disturb their party’s position in the upper house after depriving it of its seats “won with clear margin in national and provincial levels”.
Probe into threatening letters
The party also demanded a thorough and immediate investigation into the threatening letters sent to eight judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The PTI spokesperson said prima facie, the letters containing deadly and poisonous substances were clearly intended to intimidate the judges and force them to withdraw the letter sent to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against the interference of intelligence agencies.
After the letters, the need for a decisive investigation and action into the matter of interference in judicial affairs has increased manifold, the statement said, adding that special measures should be taken for the safety and security of the six judges and their families.
The PTI spokesperson urged the chief justice to refer the judges’ letter to the full court without any further delay and take the matter to its logical conclusion through public proceedings.
Medical check-up of Bushra
The party has also voiced grave concerns over threats to the life of PTI founder Imran Khan’s spouse, Bushra Bibi.
The spokesperson alleged that toxic and suspicious substances were being mixed in her food at the Bani Gala sub-jail, where she has been incarcerated.
Ms Bibi’s life has been endangered due to the denial of her constitutional right to a medical examination.
The party demanded her medical check-up by a trusted doctor from Shaukat Khanum Hospital and sought an inquiry into the allegations to bring the culprits to justice.
The statement also denounced the re-arrest of female party leaders Sanam Javed and Aliya Hamza in another case.
The two women, already incarcerated at the Kot Lakhpat jail, have been booked in a new case for allegedly Kamar Mashani police station in  Mianwali during the protests on May 9.
State functionaries were so “petrified” of the two women’s popularity that their re-arrest had become their “top priority,” the PTI spokesperson claimed.
He said the judiciary’s silence over the issue was also raising many questions.
