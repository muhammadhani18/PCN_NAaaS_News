• PPP wins 11, PML-N bags six, MQM-P gets one seat; Vawda becomes ‘independent’ senator
• Elections to 11 KP seats not held; PTI rejects ECP decision on ‘incomplete electoral college’
ISLAMABAD: After the Election Commission of Pa­k­is­tan (ECP) delayed polling for Senate elections in PTI-ruled Khyber Pakh­t­u­nkhwa following a continuing controversy over the oath-taking of opp­osi­t­ion lawmakers on rese­rved seats, the ruling coalition clinched 19 seats in the upper house on Tuesday.
Following the election, the total strength of the upper house has increased from 66 to 85, with 59 seats going to the ruling coalition, led by PML-N. The clean sweep puts the ruling alliance in a comfortable position to get any legislation passed from both houses of parliament.
Likewise, the PPP with its 24 senators now forms one-fourth of the total strength in the house, but this hold will not remain for long, as elections on KP’s 11 seats are yet to be held.
At present, the PTI has 20 members in the Senate, followed by the PML-N with 19 lawmakers. Baloc­h­istan Awami Party has four members in the upper house while the MQM-P and Awami National Party have three members each. Pakistan Muslim League (PML-Q), Balochistan National Party (BNP-M), and National Party have one member each.
In addition to political parties, there are four independents in the upper house as well, and all of them belong to the ruling coalition. They include ex-caretaker PM Anwaarul Haq Kakar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Faisal Vawda, and Naseema Ehsan.
Polling in Islamabad
In the National Asse­mbly, lawmakers elected two senators: one each on a general and a technocrat seat. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar was elected senator on the technocrat seat defeating Raja Ansar of the PTI whereas PPP’s Rana Mahmoodul Hasan was elected senator on a general seat from the federal capital defeating his opponent Farzand Hussain of the PTI.
Though there was no sloganeering like the last time, the members thum­ped their desks to welcome their leaders, including Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. A PML-N MNA from Bahawalpur, Usman Awaisi, displayed a banner expressing solidarity with Palestine when Shehbaz Sharif polled his vote.
In light of the polling, Returning Officer Saeed Gul issued strict directives prohibiting the entry of visitors to the gallery, as the house had been turned into a polling station. He emphasised that only media personnel were allowed to observe the electoral process from the galleries.
Sindh
In Sindh, the ruling PPP clinched 10 out of 12 seats, followed by MQM-P with one seat. Ex-PTI leader Faisal Vawda became an independent senator after the PPP withdrew its candidate Sarfaraz Rajar in favour of the former MNA. The MQM-P also supported Faisal Vawda.
On general seats, PPP’s Ashraf Ali Jatoi (22 votes), Dost Ali Jessar (21 votes), Kazim Ali Shah (21 votes), Masroor Ahsan (21 votes), and Nadeem Bhutto (21 votes) were successful. MQM-P’s Amir Chishti (21 votes) and independent Faisal Vawda (21 votes) also won a general seat.
On the technocrat seats, PPP’s Zamir Ghumro (58 votes) and Sarmad Ali (57 votes) were successful, while PPP’s Rubina Saadat Qaimkhani (57 votes) and Quratulain Marri (58 votes) bagged the two seats reserved for women. PPP’s Poonjo Bheel (117 votes) was also successful on a minority seat.
Nine members of the PTI and one member of Jamaat-i-Islami boycotted the election, while three members of the Grand Democratic Alliance were deemed ineligible voters since they did not take oath as MPAs, reducing the number of voters to 165 in the 168-member house. A total of 154 votes — 117 by the PPP and 37 by the MQM-P — were cast during the polling, which continued from 9am to 4pm.
Punjab
In Punjab, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb secured victory in the upper house on a technocrat seat after securing 128 votes.
PML-N leader and Federal Minister for Energy Musadik Malik also won a technocrat seat after securing 121 votes. PML-N’s Anusha Rahman and Bushra Anjum Butt were declared victors on women’s seats, while PML-N’s Tahir Khalil Sindhu was elected on a minority seat.
KP polls postponed
In its two-page order, carrying signatures of all five members, the Election Commission of Pakistan said the electoral college was incomplete for Senate elections in the KP Assembly and the non-administration of oaths to lawmakers amounted to disenfranchisement.
“…the commission is of the considered view that the standards of honesty, justness and fairness of election as provided in Article 218(3) of the Constitution cannot be fulfilled due to non-administration of oath to elected members and which amounts to disenfranchisement of lawful voters and denial of level playing field to the voters.”

1,Ali Amin Gandapur vows to snatch back reserved seats,KP CM says 25 reserved seats for women and non-Muslim lawmakers were PTI's right.,"PESHAWAR: As Senate polls in Khyber Pakhtun­khwa hit a snag over a dispute on the oath-taking of opposition MPAs elected on reserved seats, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Tuesday said the provincial government would not let these lawmakers take oath, since the reserved seats in question belonged to the PTI.
Those 25 lawmakers — 21 elected on seats reserved for women and four on those meant for non-Muslims —awaited the administration of oaths by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati to participate in the Senate polls, on Tuesday.
They had secured these seats after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) denied the PTI a share in the reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies and allocated the same to other parliamentary parties.
Earlier in the day, ECP staff had reached the assembly hall at 8am, while the election material had been transported to the assembly a day earlier. Polling, however, was not held.
“The ECP has illegally denied awarding share to the PTI-SIC [alliance] of reserved seats and allocated our share to the opposition parties,” he said while speaking to the media on the premises of KP Assembly.
The 25 seats reserved for women and non-Muslim lawmakers were the PTI’s right, he said, adding that the political party would not backtrack from its commitments.
He questioned under which law the ECP gave a share of the PTI seats to the opposition parties in the assembly. “The ECP is constantly violating the Constitution; first it deprived the PTI of its symbol ‘bat’ in elections and then handed over its reserved seats to the opposition in the KP Assembly.”
Earlier, KP Assembly Opposition Leader Dr Ibadu­llah told media persons that it was “very strange that provincial government does not follow any law, constitution and institutions rather it follows the directives of a prisoner (Imran Khan)”.
He said that the opposition wanted to run the affairs of this province according to the law but the provincial government had no intention to do this.

According to a press release issued by the Nat­ional Assembly Secretar­iat, the members of the opp­osition, including PTI’s Gohar Khan, Amir Dogar and Omar Ayub himself, met NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, after which the announcement was made.
The statement said the nomination of the leader of the opposition was discussed during the meeting and the opposition submitted the name of Mr Ayub. Subsequently, Ayaz Sadiq declared Mr Ayub the leader of the opposition after the completion of the scrutiny process under Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business. Mr Ayub was nominated to the slot unopposed because no one else had submitted papers for the NA opposition leader seat, as the deadline ended on Monday.
A notification of his victory was also released which declared him the opposition leader with effect from April 2. On March 9, the PTI formally nominated Omar Ayub for the slot by submitting his documents to the office of the speaker.
The leader of the opposition, who sits in front of the NA speaker in the left aisle, enjoys the status of a federal minister.
The opposition leader gets a separate office where the opposition parties hold meetings. Traditionally, the Public Accounts Committee is also headed by the leader of the opposition.

4,Two more pleas filed as SC set to take up ‘meddling’ issue today,Petitioner asks SC to declare interference into judicial affairs unlawful and unconstitutional.,"ISLAMABAD: As a seven-member Supreme Court bench takes up allegations of ‘meddling in jud­icial affairs’ on Wedne­sday, Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan and the Lahore High Court Bar Associa­tion (LHCBA) have filed separate, but similar petitions, to join proceedings.
These two petitions may be clubbed with the case being heard by the larger bench, which was constituted to proceed under Article 184(3) of the Constitution after former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani recused himself from becoming part of the one-man probe commission and a group of lawyers and civil society members wrote a letter to the SC in this regard.
The alleged harassment of judges at the hands of intelligence officials was thrust into limelight on March 26 when six out of the eight judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) wrote a startling letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), detailing attempts to pressurise judges through the abduction and torture of their relatives, as well as secret surveillance inside their homes.
In his petition, Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan requested the SC to declare that the allegations levelled by the IHC judges, as well as those raised by retired Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, constitute evidence that the intelligence agencies and its operatives were involved in unlawful attempts to influence decisions of the IHC and district judiciary in Islamabad — a development that requires a judicial probe.
He also asked the SC to declare that any interference into the judicial affairs were clearly unlawful and unconstitutional and a serious threat to the rule of law and independence of the judiciary.
He further urged the SC to direct the federal government to terminate from service all such individuals which the judicial commission, so announced, determines their involvement in such unlawful acts without any retirement or other benefits being payable to them from the national exchequer.
He also requested the SC to order that the government servants including any serving army officer or operatives of ISI, who seek to influence the judicial proceedings or judges, would be liable to be terminated forthwith from service without any retirement or other benefits being payable to such individual from the national exchequer.
The LHCBA’s petition, meanwhile, urged the top court to declare the formation of the one-man commission illegal, void without lawful authority and of no legal effect and initiate an inquiry into the allegations and award exemplary punishment to those found guilty of attempts to intimidate, influence or meddle with the working of the judiciary.
The petition also emphasised that the judges must administer justice impartially without fear or favour, or bias or any concern.
The ability of judges to perform their functions was dependent on the public trust and confidence in the judiciary, the LHCBA argued.

5,WB calls for bold reforms to sustain recovery,"• Expects economy to grow by 1.8pc this fiscal, pick up to 2.3pc and 2.7pc in next two years • Projects inflation to average 26pc","• Expects economy to grow by 1.8pc this fiscal, pick up to 2.3pc and 2.7pc in next two years
• Projects inflation to average 26pc this year before falling to 15pc in FY25 and 11.5pc in FY26
ISLAMABAD: Projecting Pakistan’s economy growing by 1.8pc in the ongoing fiscal year, the World Bank on Tuesday warned that the nascent recovery was neither sustainable nor sufficient to address growing poverty (currently at 40pc) unless bold, steadfast and broad-based reforms were implemented on an urgent and sustainable basis.
In its biannual report, Pakistan Development Update (PDU): Fiscal Impact of Federal State-Owned Enterprises, the bank said the SOEs were getting budget support of around 2pc of GDP and responsible for about 18pc of the country’s fiscal deficit and yet the government was practically doing little except a lot of legislative and regulatory work.
“Results have yet to materialise,” even though the process for corporate governance improvement and related activities started in 2013, said Quratulain Hadi, a co-author of the report.
The World Bank also raised questions over the creation of the $8 billion sovereign wealth fund (SWF) of eight leading profitable SOEs in oil and gas and financial sectors, saying these had moved out of the ambit of the SOE Policy and related transparency.
The transfer of these four SOEs — OGDCL, PPL, Gover­nment Holdings, and National Bank of Pakistan — “may significantly change the outlook of the SOE portfolio”, it said, adding that these four state-owned firms accounted for 42pc of total profits and 12pc of total assets in the portfolio in 2022.
“The SOEs within the SWF should be classified as commercial SOEs and be governed by the SOE Act and Policy,” the bank demanded.
Alternatively, if the government owns and controls the sovereign wealth fund, it could be designated as a commercial SOE to ensure appropriate ove­r­sight and alignment with best corporate governance practices.
“The government should ens­ure adequate governance arr­angements for the SWF to safeguard assets and stakeholders’ interest … (and) plan an annual evaluation of the SWF against its mandate,” the bank said.
Moreover, the government sho­uld consider the fund for me­mbership in the Interna­ti­o­nal Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) and adopt its performance and reporting standards, the bank demanded.
The bank projected the real GDP to grow by 1.8pc this year from a negative 0.2pc last year, moving on to 2.3pc in fiscal 2025 and 2.7pc by fiscal 2026.
The growth is premised on 3pc higher inputs in agriculture, 1.8pc in industry and 1.2pc in the services sector this year unless there is any unseen shock. The World Bank projected inflation to average 26pc this year before falling to 15pc in 2024-25 and 11.5pc in 2025-26.
The fiscal deficit would remain elevated in the World Bank’s projects — a mammoth 8pc of GDP this year, followed by 7.4pc in 2025 and 6.6pc in 2026.
The current account deficit is projected at 0.7pc this year and 0.6pc in the next two fiscal years. There would thus be a nominal decline in debt-to-GDP ratio to 73.1pc this year and 62.3pc next year from a peak of 80.7pc of GDP in fiscal 2023.
Inflation, interest rate decline
Responding to a question about whether declining inflation meant a cut in the policy rate soon, the World Bank’s country director for Pakistan, Najy Benhassine, said that “we should see some positive development” on interest rates but added that a decline in inflation and interest rate was subject to successful fiscal consolidation.
Regarding tough structural reforms, Mr Benhassine said he hoped the prevailing macroeconomic crisis to be Pakistan moment as many other nations had corrected course after such challenges to sail through to sustainable development.
He said the recent moderate pickup in growth was welcome but insufficient to address growing poverty and “a lot more needs to be done to achieve at least 5-6pc growth rate. Difficult reforms needed to contain large fiscal deficits”, he said.
He declined to comment on the prevailing political environment and whether a coalition government could deliver those difficult reforms but added that success stories in other countries were never predicted but were built upon transparency and consistency in reforms that revived business and economic confidence.
To another question, he said models like the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) were used as a delivery unit in some other countries, including Egypt, to unlock channels for new investments, but these should not be restricted for all other businesses. Such forums could be used to facilitate investment triggers, he said.
The World Bank’s underlying message was that there were moderate and early signs of economic recovery, but these were on the weak foundations.
“Subdued recovery reflects tight monetary and fiscal policy, continued import management measures aimed at preserving scarce foreign reserves, and muted economic activity amid weak confidence,” it said.
“Growth remains insufficient to reduce poverty, with 40pc of Pakistanis now living below the poverty line. Macroeconomic risks remain very high amid a large debt burden and limited foreign exchange reserves,” it pointed out.
“The structural reforms needed to durably improve the economic outlook are known. Developing a clearly articulated reform implementation plan that is ambitious, credible, and shows quick progress is now essential to restoring confidence,” Mr Benhassine said.
