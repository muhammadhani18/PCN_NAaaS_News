0,"Natural, administrative constraints mar kharif outlook",Irsa estimates 31pc shortfall in water supply.,"ISLAMABAD: With an anticipated higher-than-normal temperature and an almost 31 per cent lower-than-usual snow bank, major crops in kharif (April-October) face a challenging outlook.
In addition, the unusual operational constraint at both major water reservoirs — Tarbela and Man­gla dams — and administrative weakness­es at the irrigation network are presenting a daunting task for water regulations.
With many ifs and buts, it was in this environment that the Irsa Advisory Committee (IAC) estimated 30pc water shortage in early kharif and about 7pc in late kharif. The uncertainty over water availability prevailed even after the IAC as the Water & Power Development Authority (Wapda) did not assure when major outlets at Tarbela dam (three tunnels and a low level outlet) could be made available for water discharges.
The meeting, presided over by Indus River System Authority (Irsa) Chairman Abdul Hameed Mengal, was not satisfied with the Wapda’s input as to when three tunnels (T3, T4 & T5) and the low-level outlet of Tarbela would be ready for use. 

Irsa estimates 31pc shortfall in water supply  

The uncertainty has been further aggravated after construction activities were suspended following the terrorist attack on Chinese workers. The only suggestion from the Wapda side was to “keep filling the reservoir,” which could mean a water shortage going up by 5-7pc to 35-35pc as the outflow capacity remains compromised even if the dam has enough stored water.
Therefore, the IAC constituted a committee comprising Irsa members from Sindh and Punjab and their respective chief engineers “to physically review and monitor the sites and furnish the report to resolve the operational constraints”.
Provincial share allocations 
As such, the meeting also decided to go for water allocations among the provinces under 3-tier formula, albeit with muted opposition from Sindh for ‘principled reasons’ as there would be 63.61 million acre feet (MAF) of water for provincial shares against about 79MAF envisioned under the Water Accord.
Pakistan Meteorological Department “highlighted that during winter snowfall in the catchments of Indus & Jhelum recorded at 34.8 inches against the normal of 50.5 inches, i.e. 31pc less”, an official statement said adding that “PMD also forecasted higher than normal temperatures during the upcoming kharif season”.
This could create a new challenge. If higher temperatures lead to earlier melting of fewer than normal snow deposits, the water supply availability for irrigation in the later part could be constrained even further and there may be capacity problems in the wake of monsoon rains. This was more critical given that the PMD forecast pertained only to the April-June period and did not have any outlook for July-September.
As such, total water availability was estimated at 73.69MAF, of which 63.61MAF would be distributed among the provinces after leaving 10.1MAF for environmental reasons downstream Kotri. After setting aside KP and Balochistan share without shortage application, about 60MAF would go to Sindh (28.8MAF) and Punjab (31.13MAF).
The participants agreed that Punjab and Sindh would activate their respective Discharge Observation Cells (DOCs) for data reporting at different locations. Punjab SDOs will be stationed at Guddu, Sukkur and Kotri barrages in Sindh, while Sindh SDOs will monitor the discharges at Jinnah Headworks, Chashma Barrage, Taunsa and Panjnad headworks in Punjab.
Punjab and Sindh promised DOCs would be activated within a fortnight.
Rabi system operations
The meeting also reviewed the rabi 2023-24 (October-March) system operation and showed satisfaction about the overall seasonal close at 17pc shortages against the anticipated shortfall of 15pc.
While Sindh registered its muted stance against the continuation of the three-tier formula for the distribution of water shares among the provinces but acknowledged that little could be done at the Irsa level when the matter was pending before the Council of Common Interests.

1,‘Liberalising economy can unlock trillions’,"PIDE calls for uniform tax rates across all sources of income, simplification and certainty of taxation system.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Institute of Devel­opment Economics (Pide), a state-owned think tank, has asked the government to shift gear from bureaucratic permissions to rule-based market liberalisation, exploit over Rs300 billion annual revenue potential from real estate through transparency, generate gains in agriculture sector worth Rs1.7 trillion and open up public land in Islamabad worth Rs2.2tr for private investment — all through immediate and widespread reforms led through firms specialising in digitisation.
In its ambitious reform advice, “ISLAAH: Immediate Reform Agenda — IMF and Beyond“, to the government, the think tank said the proposed plan would respond to Pakistan’s urgent need for external financing exceeding $120bn over the next five years.
This “is a clarion call for a systemic overhaul to ensure economic progress and prosperity, moving beyond the narrow interests that often dominate the discourse on reform in Pakistan”.
Dr Nadeemul Haque, a former deputy chairman of the Planning Commission and Vice Chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), called for uniform tax rates across all sources of income, simplification and certainty of tax system, and tax harmonisation across the country.

PIDE calls for uniform tax rates across all sources of income, simplification and certainty of taxation system

“A central component of this strategy is the implementation of a ‘regulatory guillotine’ to eliminate burdensome regulations hindering business growth and innovation,” Mr Haque said.
“In our pursuit of economic efficiency, it’s imperative to shift from a system of permissions to clear rules, as permissions not only consume valuable time and resources but also incur significant documentation costs, both directly and in terms of missed opportunities.
“To achieve this, we must prioritise clear rules,
digitisation, and market liberalisation, putting an
end to the bureaucratic penchant for permissions and paperwork, thereby overcoming the ‘Permissionistan’ syndrome.
“Drawing inspiration from India’s successful reforms in 1991, it’s evident that piecemeal approaches won’t suffice. Instead, we advocate the implementation of a regulatory guillotine, a proven strategy adopted by countries like Hungary, Mexico, South Korea, and the UAE,” he said.
Dr Nadeem said the government should pay attention to streamlining taxes in a revenue-neutral manner while finalising budget proposals, with a commitment to refrain from introducing new taxes in every budget cycle as tax uncertainty and instability had driven investments underground, hindered firm growth, and impeded corporatisation and listing.
In addressing the income tax regime, Pide suggested a uniform tax rate across all sources of income, with provisions for agriculture income losses carry-forward and adjustment, along with the elimination of the presumptive tax regime and taxes on turnover.
It also called for uniformity in taxation for AOPs, sole proprietors, and corporations, alongside reforms in inter-corporate dividend income and asset sales taxation.
The think tank called for transitioning from withholding taxes to advance income tax mechanisms, besides harmonising the sales tax system across goods and services, expediting the implementation of POS through outsourcing within six months, and transitioning to a VAT mode with consistent rates.

2,Millers begin lobbying for 1m tonnes sugar export,Informed sources say the sugar millers have already activated their political channels in the new government.,"ISLAMABAD: With sugar prices already up 42 per cent over last year, the influential sugar industry has started lobbying for major exports – at least one million tonnes – to “ensure payments to farmers”.
Informed sources said the sugar millers had already activated their political channels in the new government to secure permission for sugar exports and some procurements by the government for strategic reserves to ensure higher profitability notwithstanding the inflationary pressures in the country.
In a formal letter, the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) also asked Commerce Minister Jam Kamal to start the approval process for exporting at least one million tonnes in two equal instalments as the crop output was almost 1.5 million tonnes higher than the domestic needs. 
It demanded that remaining 0.5m tonnes should be purchased by the government. This would ensure foreign exchange earnings of about $700m and timely payments to farmers, the sugar cartel wrote. It said the sugar industry was the second largest agro-based industry of Pakistan after textiles that generated direct and indirect business activity of Rs800 billion to Rs1 trillion annually in agriculture, transport, allied industries, wholesale and retail markets.
The letter said the sugar industry was paying around Rs125bn in direct and indirect taxes to the federal, provincial and local governments, providing direct employment to 1.5 million people and rendering $5bn worth of import substitution to the national economy.

3,Local cement sales fall on construction lull,"Export despatches, however, increased by 38pc to 605,142 tonnes.","KARACHI: Construction activities remained slow as local cement despatches fell year-on-year by 0.62 per cent in March and 3.81pc in 9MFY24, respectively.
Local sales eased to 3.336 million tonnes from 3.357m tonnes in March 2023, showing a decline of 0.62pc. Export despatches, however, increased by 38pc to 605,142 tonnes from 438,433 tonnes a year ago.  
As a result, the overall cement despatches (local and export) rose 3.85pc in March to 3.941m tonnes versus 3.795m tonnes during the same month of 2023.
According to the data released by the All Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association, domestic despatches during 9MFY24 were 29.401m tonnes as against 30.564m tonnes last year, showing a reduction of 3.81pc.
Export despatches during 9MFY24 rose by a healthy 68pc as the volumes increased to 5.101m tonnes from 3.036m tonnes in the same period last year.
During July-March FY24, total cement despatches (domestic and exports) were 34.502m tonnes, showing a rise of 2.68pc over 33.6m tonnes in the corresponding period last year.
The APCMA spokesman said the industry hopes the new government will address its concerns. Cement units have increased their capacities in anticipation of higher construction activities, but operating at full capacity remains a distant dream.
Fahad Hussain Khan of Topline Securities attributed low cement sales to a slowdown in construction activities due to the higher cost of inputs, the high base effect of last year as cement despatches were up due to flood-related construction activities, and the implementation of axle load, as companies were facing issues in transporting cement.
He said export growth is mainly due to Lucky Cement, which recently secured orders mostly from African countries.
The average retail price in March increased by Rs10 per bag to Rs1,205 per 50 kg bag in the south, while it declined by Rs6 per bag to Rs1,239 per bag in the North, according to the official data.
Mr Fahad anticipated local sales to remain flat year-on-year at 40m tonnes, down from an earlier estimate of 5pc growth in FY24, while export sales would continue their momentum. Total cement despatches may clock in at 47m tonnes, up 5pc in FY24.

7,CCP issues notices  to urea makers,CCP issues show-cause notices to six leading fertiliser companies for allegedly fixing urea prices.,"ISLAMABAD: The Com­p­­etition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has issued show-cause notices to the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council (FMPAC) and six leading fertililiser companies for allegedly fixing urea prices, a prima facie violation of Section 4 of the Competition Act 2010.
Urea prices play a crucial role in determining the prices of essential food commodities. Any arbitrary increase in urea prices by fertiliser companies can lead to higher costs for farmers, ultimately resulting in more expensive food prices for consumers.
CCP’s inquiry found that FMPAC and its six-member firms, including Engro Fer­t­ilisers Ltd, Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd, Fatima Fert­i­liser Company Ltd, Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Ltd, Agritech Ltd and Fatima Fe­r­tiliser Ltd of prima facie violating the competition law.
The inquiry was prom­pted by an FMPAC’s advertisement in November 2021, where they annou­nced a ‘Maximum Retail Price of urea at Rs1,768 per 50kg bag’ during a time of rising prices and reported shortages.
The inquiry proceedings revealed urea prices were deregulated under the Fertiliser Policy 2001. The advertisement contents were seen as a decision by an association on the sale rate of urea, a violation of section 4(2)(a) of the act.
The inquiry also noted a pattern of uniform pricing and price parallelism am­o­ng urea companies, suggesting potential collusive activity.
`Despite receiving subsidised feedstock gas from the government, which varies in rate for each plant, these companies’ prices showed uniformity in some instances. This raises questions about their cost structures and subsidies received.

8,Stocks manage modest gains in cautious trading,Analyst said the market showed recovery as investors weigh the 22-month lowest inflation reading below the ministry o f finance's projection.,"KARACHI: In a volatile session, the equities market closed in the green on Tuesday on rising hopes of an imminent interest rate cut following a sharp dece­l­eration in CPI-based inflation to 20.68 per cent in March.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation Ltd said the market showed recovery as investors weigh the 22-month lowest inflation reading below the Ministry of Finance’s projection of 23.5pc, which is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the State Bank’s policy rate next month.
He said the surging glo­bal stocks and crude oil prices, deliberations over priv­atising loss-making sta­te-owned enterprises and exchange rate stability hel­p­ed the index stay bullish.
Topline Securities Ltd. said the trading began on a positive note, as the KSE 100-share index gained 163 points, climbing to an intraday high of 66,960, just below the 67,000 level. 
However, a section of investors indulged in profit-taking at the day’s high, trimming early gains. The cautious market players preferred to stay on the sidelines ahead of the Eidul Fitr holidays, starting April 9, and the absence of any trigger that may influence market direction. 
As a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 66,886.26 points after eking out 89.94 points, or 0.13 per cent, from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume edged higher 0.34pc to 239.6 million shares. The traded value was also up 6.94pc to Rs8.94bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom Ltd (32.34m shares), Pakistan Telecom­mu­nication Company Ltd (27.13m shares), Pak Reinsurance Ltd (13.12m shares), Telecard Ltd (9.53m shares) and Flying Cement Ltd (7.38m shares).
The shares registering the most significant incre­ases in their share prices in absolute terms were Hallm­ark Company Ltd (Rs39.60), Pakistan Servi­ces Company Ltd (Rs34.50), Sazgar Engine­ering Company Ltd (Rs22.43), Murree Brewery (Rs22.11) and Atlas Honda Ltd (Rs14.00).
The companies registering the major decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Pakistan Tob­­a­cco Company Ltd (Rs47.85), Abbott Lab Ltd (Rs23.22), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs22.02), Blessed Tex­tile Ltd (Rs19.80) and Indus Motor Company Ltd (Rs17.11).
Foreign investors remai­ned net buyers as they pic­ked shares worth $0.42m.
