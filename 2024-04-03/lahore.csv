0,Conducting class-IX exam: Teachers say bar on private invigilators causes problems for them,PTU said that the examination centres were facing an acute shortage of staff since the government has removed the private invigilators.,"LAHORE: Punjab government’s action against hiring of private invigilators to conduct class-IX examination and abrupt posting of public school teachers for the purpose has not only created issues for the teachers, but also for the examination controllers of the boards of intermediate and secondary education (BISEs).
Lahore BISE had removed all private invigilators hired for the conduct of the class IX annual examination after finding that they were involved in facilitating cheating and were found giving favours to some candidates after receiving bribe from them.
To replace the private invigilators, teachers of public schools have been appointed in an abrupt move at the class-IX examination centres.
A Punjab Teachers Union (PTU) office-bearer told Dawn that the examination centres were facing an acute shortage of staff since the government has removed the private invigilators, replacing them with schoolteachers.
He termed the move ill-timed as the provincial school education department was already facing a shortage of around 125,000 teachers.
He says that many schoolteachers could not appear at the examination centres for performing investigator’s duty as they had been hastily posted at places situated far away from the areas where they reside.
He says the authorities concerned should have considered the factor of distance as these teachers have not been provided any transport facility to reach the exam centres.
The PTU representative adds that the issue becomes more serious when it comes to female teachers who were appointed as invigilators. As a result, he says, many female teachers could not report at the designated examination centres, causing delay in conduct of the examination at most of the centres.
To meet the staff shortage, he says, the superintendents of many exam centres had to appoint the staffer of nearby colleges as invigilators.
On the other hand, the PTU officer-bearers say that hundreds of schools were also facing shortage of teachers after the start of the new academic year in the province because of the government move of appointing teachers as invigilators.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government on Tuesday continued action against those involved in irregularities during class-IX examination.
Commissioner and Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) Lahore acting chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa conducted a surprise visit to an examination centre established in a private school of Shadman and suspended its superintendent after finding private invigilators at the centre.
He also ordered action against the superintendent under the Peeda Act while Lahore BISE controller of examination issued suspension orders of the superintendent.
Mr Randhawa also inspected the exam centre at the MAO College in the evening and found no private invigilator there.
He inspected the footage of the CCTV cameras installed in the centre and directed the controller to properly inform the teachers about their duties.
He also directed the controller to take strict action against the teachers who remain absent from their examination duties.
He said it was the responsibility of the deputy commissioner concerned and chief executive officer of the district to ensure the availability of the examination staff.
A couple of days ago, Punjab School Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat had removed Lahore BISE chairman and the controller examination for their alleged involvement in facilitating cheating during the ongoing class-IX annual exams.
A committee, headed by additional commissioner (coordination), had been constituted to investigate the complaints against the two officials.

2,Police official held for releasing drug case suspect,LAHORE: The police arrested one of their own colleagues on Tuesday for facilitating the release of a nominated...,"LAHORE: The police arrested one of their own colleagues on Tuesday for facilitating the release of a nominated suspect involved in a drug case.
The action came after an inquiry led by Organised Crime Unit SP Aftab Phularwan into allegations against Sub-Inspector (SI) Jawad, in charge of the drug cell at Muslim Town police station.
Another SI Arslan from Bhatti Gate police, was also directed to be arrested for his involvement in mediating between suspect Fazalur Rehman and SI Jawad.

The judge expressed astonishment upon learning that, according to police records, the suspect had already been “arrested”.
During the inquiry proceedings, SI Jawad confessed to releasing the accused in order to appease his colleague, SI Arslan.
In addition to efforts to arrest the drug suspect and the implicated police officials, the SP has instructed the initiation of another case against all three suspects.

3,Rice scientists reject Indian claim of ‘seed technology piracy’,Rice institute director says DNA of two basmati varieties entirely different from Indian seeds,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s rice scientists have rejected an Indian claim that ‘two high-yielding basmati varieties being sown in the country are stolen from India’, with the industry urging the government to initiate concrete action to foil fresh Indian propaganda to undermine the nation’s rice exports.
“The claim is completely preposterous and merely propaganda. It has no leg to stand on,” the director of the Rice Research Institute (RRI), Dr Muhammad Ijaz, says.
India’s agricultural scientists have recently accused the Pakistani rice growers and exporters of ‘seed technology piracy’, claiming that Pakistan has “renamed basmati rice varieties developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), PUSA 2011 and 1509.
IARI director A K Singh was widely quoted by India’s mainstream media as alleging that the “Pakistani rice export companies are selling them in the international market” as Kainat 2011 and Kissan Basmati. He also went on to urge both the Indian government and rice industry to initiate a legal action against Pakistani seed firms involved in piracy in order to protect the interests of Indian rice farmers and exporters.

Rice institute director says DNA of two basmati varieties entirely different from Indian seeds

Dr Ijaz maintains that the DNA of the two Pakistani varieties was entirely different from the Indian seeds. “I believe the rapid growth in rice exports from Pakistan prompted the IARI director to make such wild, baseless allegations,” he adds.
In the meanwhile, the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (REAP) has reached out to the RRI for providing it the samples of four Pakistani and Indian rice varieties each, and their DNA profiles if already done. The request has been made for the third-party assessment and DNA sequencing for comparison between them, the acting chairman of REAP, Haseeb Ali Khan, asserts.
The Indian allegations and propaganda drive against Pakistan’s rice exports has set alarm bells ringing across the industry. Many have called upon relevant government authorities, particularly the commerce ministry, to take immediate notice of the Indian propaganda and officially counter as it might affect rice export shipments from the country.
Pakistan Hi-Tech Hybrid Seed Association Chairman Shahzad Ali Malik is deeply concerned over the allegations. “This is a very disconcerting situation for every stakeholder: farmers, millers and exporters,” he notes while speaking with this reporter on Tuesday.
“Our government must take a serious note of the Indian accusations, and join forces with the rice industry to foil the Indian designs to prevent them from damaging our basmati exports,” he adds. He reminds the authorities that “this is not the first time that an effort has been made by Indians to steal our basmati heritage from us, and, hence we must give them a befitting response”.
Mr Malik was referring to India’s failed attempt to claim the “exclusive Geographical Indication (GI) tag” for basmati rice a few years ago. “Indians are worried about Pakistan’s surging rice exports and are bent upon damaging us by hook or by crook,” he says. “It is a very serious issue and the government should take proactive action to foil another attempt to impede Pakistan’s basmati exports,” he emphasised.

5,Cleric’s acquittal in Faisalabad rape bid case declared violation of SC verdict,Apex court's 2019 order declared jirgahs unlawful; inquiry asks police to challenge magistrate’s decision.,"LAHORE: A high-level police inquiry into the case of attempted rape of a 12-year-old boy in Tandlianwala, Faisalabad, has declared the acquittal of the suspect nominated in the initial FIR on the mediation of a ‘Jirga/Panchayat’ a blatant violation of the Supreme Court’s judgment, Dawn has learnt from reliable sources.
The Supreme Court’s landmark judgment had appeared in January 2019 when the legal status of the ‘council of elders’, ‘Panchayat’ or ‘kangaroo courts’ operating as alternative to the judicial system or for mediation in tribal belts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and rural areas of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan was challenged.
 
 

The inquiry asks the police concerned to challenge in the higher courts acquittal of the suspect, Maulana Abubakar Muavia, by a magistrate after the father of the boy gave a statement in his favour.
A video had appeared on social media four days back in which the child’s father Mudassar Nazeer was seen stating that he had forgiven the suspect in the name of God. In the same video, a known cleric appeared, saying he had investigated the case on his own and met the child’s father too. He said it was not a matter of molestation but an exchange of harsh words between the boy’s father and the suspect.
 







Inquiry asks police to challenge magistrate’s decision on Faisalabad case

The other day the issue was also raised in the National Assembly by PPP MNA Abdul Qadir Patel who asked the state to be a complainant in the case if the child’s father had forgiven him on intervention of the clerics. He also sought proper investigation into the case.
 






The sources say reinvestigation into the case was launched on the order of IGP Dr Usman Anwar when Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz took notice of the incident and directed him (the IGP) to hold an impartial inquiry to know on what grounds the suspect was discharged in the case and determine the role of the police.
Abubakar Mauvia was discharged from the case by Tandlianwala Judicial Magistrate Nauman Tahir on March 30 when the police presented him in the court, seeking further physical remand to continue interrogating him.
During the hearing, the complainant along with his son also appeared and submitted a written statement that he got his FIR lodged on the basis of ‘suspicion’ against Mauvia. The magistrate’s decision mentioned that the complainant had submitted an affidavit too.
“On query, the minor/victim also stated that the present accused didn’t commit the offence as mentioned in the FIR,” reads the magistrate’s decision.
“So, the request of the investigation officer to grant physical remand of the accused is not justifiable and the same is turned down and the accused is discharged from this case,” it adds.
Dawn obtained all relevant documents, including a copy of the written statement submitted by the complainant before the magistrate.
This complainant’s statement appeared to be the turning point that prompted the Punjab police high-ups to get the case reinvestigated as it mentioned the decision of a ‘Jirga Panchayat’.
 
 

An official, privy to the development, said that during the inquiry, the legal branch of the police referred to the Supreme Court’s 2019 judgment when the matter of the legality of Jirgas or Kangaroo courts was raised.
The Supreme Court judgment declares that the Jirgahs, Panchayats etc do not operate under the Constitution or any other law whatsoever to the extent that they attempt to adjudicate on civil or criminal matters.
The official said the police legal branch recommended to the department high-ups to issue directions to challenge the magistrate’s decision of acquittal of the suspect. He further said the legal branch was of the view that local police should be directed to determine the role of ‘the Panchayat’ in the light of the SC’s judgment to further proceed against them. If found guilty, they must be held accountable on abetment charges, he said.
The IGP confirmed that the matter was investigated at a high level in light of the magistrate’s decision. He said he and the prosecutor general had met the victim boy and his father and discussed the issue of allegations levelled against the suspect.
“The police discharged its core functions in this case, lodged an FIR, arrested the suspect and presented him before the court for physical remand,” the IG added, urging the society to stand up to perform its due role.
