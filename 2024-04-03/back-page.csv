• Military says conducting thorough review at highest levels
• Tragic incident draws widespread condemnation, demand for investigation from Western capitals
GAZA STRIP: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday an Israeli airstrike that killed seven people working for the aid charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) in Gaza was unintended and “tragic”, and the military pledged an independent inquiry.
The Israeli military expressed “sincere sorrow” over the incident, which drew widespread condemnation and ratcheted up pressure for steps to ease the disastrous humanitarian situation in Gaza after nearly six months of war.
The strike on the WCK convoy killed citizens of Australia, Britain and Poland as well as Palestinians and a dual citizen of the United States and Canada.
WCK, which was founded by celebrity chef Jose Andres, said they had been travelling in two armoured cars emblazoned with the charity’s logo and another vehicle.
“Unfortunately in the past day there was a tragic event in which our forces unintentionally harmed non-combatants in the Gaza Strip,” Netanyahu said in a video statement.
“This happens in war. We are conducting a thorough inquiry and are in contact with the governments. We will do everything to prevent a recurrence.”
Britain summoned Israel’s ambassador in London to express its “unequivocal condemnation of the appalling killing” of the WCK workers, three of whom were British nationals.
“Israel must urgently explain how this happened and make major changes to ensure safety of aid workers on the ground,” British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said in a post on X.
 






Washington urged Israel to conduct a swift, thorough and impartial investigation into the airstrike, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday.
Blinken arrived in Paris for talks with senior officials including President Emmanuel Macron. “We’ve spoken directly to the Israeli government about this particular incident. We’ve urged a swift, a thorough and impartial investigation,” Blinken told reporters at a press conference in Paris, adding that humanitarian workers have to be protected.
“These people are heroes, they run into the fire, not away from it,” he said of the NGO workers killed in the strike. “We shouldn’t have a situation where people who are simply trying to help their fellow human beings are themselves at grave risk.” But Blinken stopped short of directly condemning the attack, unlike his French counterpart Stephane Sejourne.
Speaking alongside Blinken, Sejourne voiced France’s “firm condemnation” of the Israeli airstrike. “Nothing can justify such a tragedy,” he said.
Canada also condemned the Israeli strike and called for a full investigation.
“I am horrified to hear reports of the IDF strike taking the lives of seven World Central Kitchen employees in Gaza yesterday, including a Canadian citizen,” Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said on Tuesday.
“We condemn these strikes and call for a full investigation. Canada expects full accountability for these killings and we will convey this to the Israeli government directly. Strikes on humanitarian personnel are absolutely unacceptable,” she said on X.
 






Increasing Israeli isolation
Australia and Poland, countries which have generally been friendly towards Israel, all demanded action to protect aid workers, underlining Netanyahu’s increasing diplomatic isolation over the situation in Gaza.
Israel has long denied accusations that it is hindering the distribution of urgently needed food aid in Gaza, which it has besieged in a war since October, saying the problem is caused by international aid groups’ inability to get it to those in need.
Despite coordinating movements with the Israeli military, the convoy was hit as it was leaving its Deir al-Balah warehouse after unloading more than 100 tonnes of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza by sea, WCK said.
“This is not only an attack against WCK, this is an attack on humanitarian organisations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war,” said Erin Gore, chief executive of World Central Kitchen. “This is unforgivable.”
The Israeli military (IDF) said it was conducting a thorough review at the highest levels to understand the circumstances of what it called a tragic incident, and pledged an investigation by “an independent, professional and expert body”.
The UN and other international groups have accused Israel of hindering aid distribution with bureaucratic obstacles and failing to ensure the security of food convoys, underlined by a disaster on Feb 29, in which around 100 people were killed as they awaited an aid delivery.

1,Anti-Muslim incidents in US hit record high in 2023,WASHINGTON: Repor­ted discrimination and attacks against Muslims and Palestinians reached a record high in the...,"WASHINGTON: Repor­ted discrimination and attacks against Muslims and Palestinians reached a record high in the United States in 2023, driven by rising Islamophobia and bias as the Israel-Gaza war raged late in the year, data from an advocacy group showed on Tuesday.
Complaints totaled 8,061 in 2023, a 56 per cent rise from the year before and the highest since the Cou­ncil on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) began records nearly 30 years ago. About 3,600 of those incidents occurred from October to December, CAIR said.
Human rights advocates have similarly reported a global rise in Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian bias and antisemitism since the latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East.
US incidents have included the fatal October stabbing of 6-year-old Palestinian American Wadea Al-Fayoume in Illinois, the November shooting of three students of Palestinian descent in Vermont and the February stabbing of a Palestinian American man in Texas.
CAIR’s report said 2023 saw a “resurgence of anti-Muslim hate” after the first-ever recorded annual drop in complaints in 2022. In the first nine months of 2023, such incidents averaged around 500 a month before jumping to nearly 1,200 a month in the last quarter.
“The primary force behind this wave of heightened Islamophobia was the escalation of violence in Israel and Palestine in October 2023,” the report said.
The most numerous complaints in 2023 were in the categories of immigration and asylum, employment discrimination, hate crimes and education discrimination, CAIR said.
The council said it compiled the numbers by reviewing public statements and videos as well as reports from public calls, emails and an online complaint system.
It contacted people whose incidents were reported in the media.

2,AAP minister alleges she’s under pressure to join BJP or face arrest,Atishi says four more party leaders will be arrested soon.,"NEW DELHI: Delhi minister and senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Atishi alleged on Tuesday that the BJP and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are targeting her, along with Health Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj, MLA Durgesh Pathak and Rajya Sabha MP Raghav Chadha, as they want to arrest them.
The minister was quoted by the Indian Express as saying she was “threatened” to join the BJP if she did not wish to be arrested within the next month.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Tuesday granted bail to AAP’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh, curiously after the prosecution did not oppose the bail, reports said.
Accusing the BJP of trying to topple the AAP and the Delhi government, she said: “After arresting four of our senior leaders — Satyendar Jain, Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal — the BJP is conspiring to arrest four more leaders of the AAP.

Atishi says four more party leaders will be arrested soon

They (BJP), thought AAP will fall with the arrest of CM Arvind Kejriwal and the senior leadership. Now as they have realized, it is not going to happen, they are targeting us.”
The arrests of two serving chief ministers — of Delhi and Jharkhand — by the Modi government’s ‘agencies’ were at the heart of a mammoth opposition rally in Delhi on Sunday.
Atishi added: “They are going to arrest me, Saurabh Bharadwaj, Durgesh Pathak and Raghav Chadha. After the mega INDIA alliance rally on Sunday, the BJP is now scared… So, it is plotting to arrest the four senior leaders of the party that remain.”
The minister also alleged that the ED will soon raid these leaders’ homes and issue summons to them before making the arrests. “I have also been told that soon, the ED is going to raid my personal residence, my relative’s place, and after that four of us will be issued summons and will be subsequently arrested,” she said.
The minister alleges that she was approached by the BJP and “threatened” to join the party. “I have been approached by the BJP, through one of my close aides, to join their party.
They are also threatening me with the fact that if I do not join the party, I will be arrested by the ED in the next one month and my political career and future will end… They reached out to one of my close associates with this offer and said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP want to topple and destroy the AAP,” she said.
“I want to tell the BJP that AAP leaders are not going to get scared of your threats. We are soldiers of Arvind Kejriwal and followers of Bhagat Singh!
“We will die and suffer but will fall into your trap and join the BJP. You can arrest all our leaders, all MLAs, but we will not stop our fight.”
Hitting back, Delhi BJP secretary Harish Khurana said, “A new day, a new manohar kahani (beautiful story); Atishi has tried to spread media sensation once again… It is a challenge Atishi-ji — give us a name or a BJP delegation or we will once again file a police complaint against you.”
“You are making such allegations because Arvind Kejriwal, your topmost leader, is in jail for corruption at the honourable court’s directions.
“For 14 months, Manish Sisodia has been in jail as per court directions. Sanjay Singh, Vijay Nair, Kavitha are in jail not because of ED’s orders on the directions of honourable courts,” Khurana added.

3,Google agrees to delete records from Incognito tracking,Tech giant accused of invading people’s privacy by collecting user data.,"Google has agreed to delete billions of records and submit to some restrictions on its power to track users, under the terms of a proposed legal settlement, BBC News reported.
The deal aims to resolve a class action lawsuit brought in the United States in 2020, which had accused the tech giant of invading people’s privacy by collecting user data even when they were browsing in ‘private mode’.
The suit had sought $5 billion in damages. Google is supporting the deal, though it disputes the claims. It has already made changes in response to the lawsuit.
The data deletion will also apply outside of the United States.

Tech giant accused of invading people’s privacy by collecting user data

In January, shortly after the two sides announced plans to settle the case, the company updated its disclosures to make it clear that it still tracked user data even when users opted to search privately or using its “Incognito” setting.
That mode provides some increased privacy because it does not save the browsing activity to the machine being used.
Google settles lawsuit for ‘private mode’ tracking That same month, the firm said it was starting to trial a feature that would automatically block third-party cookies, which help track user activity, for all Google Chrome users.
It had made that block automatic for Incognito users shortly after the lawsuit was filed in 2020 and has agreed to ensure that limit is in place for five years, according to the terms of the settlement deal, filed on Monday in federal court in San Francisco.
On Monday, Google also agreed to delete “hundreds of billions” of private browsing data records it had collected, the court filing said.
“We are pleased to settle this lawsuit, which we always believed was meritless,” Google spokesman Jorge Castaneda said in a statement, noting that the company would not be paying any damages.
“We are happy to delete old technical data that was never associated with an individual and was never used for any form of personalisation.”
Google is still facing lawsuits from individuals over privacy violations, which could lead to financial penalties.
Lawyer David Boies of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, who represented users in the fight, called the deal an “historic step in requiring honesty and accountability from dominant technology companies”.
The lawsuit had claimed that despite its suggestions to the contrary, Google had tracked users’ activity even when they set the Google Chrome browser to Incognito mode and other browsers to private mode.
The legal battle revealed documents in which Google employees described Incognito as “effectively a lie” and “a confusing mess”, according to court filing.
Last year, Judge Yvonne Rogers rejected Google’s bid to have the case dismissed, saying she could not agree that users consented to allowing Google to collect information on their browsing activity.
The deal will now go to the court for approval.
The settlement comes as big tech firms are facing increased scrutiny of their practices in the US and beyond.
In the US, Google and its parent company Alphabet are facing two separate monopoly cases brought by the federal government.
It has also recently settled a number of other suits.
It paid nearly $400 million (£318m) in 2022 to settle claims brought by US states that it tracked the location of users who had opted out of location services on their devices.
In December 2023, it also agreed to a $700m (£557m) settlement to resolve a lawsuit brought by a group of US states that had accused it of quashing competition to its Play Store on Android devices.

4,White House guest list shrinks as Muslims boycott Iftar,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden is hosting a subdued, significantly scaled-back Iftar gathering at the White ...","WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden is hosting a subdued, significantly scaled-back Iftar gathering at the White House on Tuesday night, following refusals from several Muslim American community leaders, as reported by US media.
A Florida-based Muslim advocacy group, Emgage, said it had received an invite along with other Muslim American representatives to a meeting with the president, vice president, and senior team members, but “in consultation with our team and community, we made the decision not to attend.”
Emgage said it “stands with our community who have loudly voiced their discontent with the President’s policy on Gaza.” The group believe the Biden administration “can and should leverage its enormous support for Israel and begin to take demonstrable actions” to end the conflict in Gaza.
Robert McCaw, director of the Government Affairs Department at the Council on American-Islamic Rela­tions (CAIR), told Dawn that several American Muslim organisations were hosting their own iftar across the White House to protest the Biden administration’s policies.
He said in an earlier statement that Muslim leaders were boycotting the White House Iftar to protest the administration’s failure to address the demand for Gaza ceasefire and “refusal to stop supplying manufactured weapons to Israel, which are being used in a genocide against our Palestinian brothers and sisters in Gaza”.
CNN reported earlier that the White House dinner’s guest list has shrunk due to several declines, attributed to frustration with the administration’s support of Israel amidst the Gaza humanitarian crisis.
Last year, the White House skipped hosting an Iftar dinner but welcomed nearly 350 guests for an Eid reception. This year, Ram­azan coincides with ongoing conflict in Gaza, with over 30,000 casualties rep­orted in past six months.
White House officials have engaged in multiple meetings with influential Arab American and Muslim leaders across different cities. Recently, senior US officials convened with leaders from the Arab, Muslim and Palestinian American communities in Chicago.
“Anger and concern about the administration’s handling of the conflict is also presenting political problems for Biden, including in battleground states such as Michigan, home to more than 200,000 Muslim American voters,” CNN noted.

5,Iran vows to punish Israel over Damascus embassy attack,Iranian UN mission calls attack ‘violation’ of diplomatic principles,"

RESCUE workers search through the building’s rubble a day after the air strike in Damascus, on Tuesday.—AFP

 
DUBAI: Iran said on Tuesday it would take revenge on Israel for an airstrike that killed two of its generals and five other military advisers at the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus, heightening the risk of further escalation in conflict in the Middle East.
The strike marked one of the most significant attacks yet on Iranian interests in Syria, where Israel has stepped up a long-running military campaign against Iran and groups its backs as the Gaza war has rippled around the Middle East.
Until now, Iran has avoided directly entering the fray, while backing allies’ attacks on Israeli and US targets.
Israel has not declared responsibility for the attack which destroyed a consular building adjacent to the main embassy building in the upscale Mezzeh district on Monday night, killing seven members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards (IRGC).

Iranian UN mission calls attack ‘violation’ of diplomatic principles

But a senior Israeli government official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said those hit had “been behind many attacks on Israeli and American assets and had plans for additional attacks”.
The embassy “was not a target”, the official said.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed revenge. “The Zionist regime will be punished by the hands of our brave men. We will make it regret this crime and others it has committed,” he said.
Khamenei’s political advisor Ali Shamkhani, in a post on X, said the United States “remains directly responsible whether or not it was aware of the intention to carry out this attack”.
According to Axios, citing a US official, Washington told Tehran it “had no involvement” or advanced knowledge of the Israeli strike.
Iranian state media said the death toll was 13, including six Syrians. Two security sources in Lebanon said at least one member of the Lebanese group Hezbollah was killed in the strike.
Syrian civil defence teams were still working on Tuesday to clear the rubble as ambulances were parked nearby.
Iran’s ambassador to Syria Hos­sein Akbari, who was not wounded in the strike, has said the flattened building housed his residence.
He could be seen exiting the main embassy building on Tuesday with his security guards.
Iran’s UN mission said the attack was a violation of “the foundational principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises”.
Akbari, the ambassador, said it showed total disrespect for international law and both Iran and Syria had the right to respond.
Wafa Badr, a Mezzeh resident, said she was home in the kitchen when she heard an enormous blast.
“I was knocked unconscious for about 10 minutes we were so surprised with what happened. Both our cars are destroyed,” she said.
Iranian state media said Tehran believed the target was Mohammad Reza Zahedi, one of the brigadier generals killed.
Russia called the strike an act of aggression and asked Israel to cease such “absolutely unacceptable” actions.
