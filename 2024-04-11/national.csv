0,Islamabad Bar Council slams move against Justice Kayani,"Attempts being made to erode public trust in judiciary, notes bar council","ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad Bar Council (IBC) on Tuesday condemned and denounced a “baseless” and “frivolous reference” against Islamabad High Court senior puisne judge Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Dawn.com reported.
A day earlier, a former office-bearer of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) had filed a complaint before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against Justice Kayani. 
Former IHCBA general secretary Mohammad Waqas alleged that IHC Justice Kayani “waged a war against the forces of Pakistan in a planned manner by inducing and convincing other judges of high court”.
Justice Kayani is among the six judges who recently wrote a letter to the SJC detailing alleged harassment at the hands of state institutions. In the letter, the judges had accused the intelligence apparatus of interference in judicial affairs, including attempts to pressure judges through abduction and torture of their relatives and secret surveillance inside their homes.

Attempts being made to erode public trust in judiciary, notes bar council 

In a statement released on Tuesday, the Islamabad Bar Council said Vice Chairman Adil Aziz Qazi expressed deep concern and strongly condemned the move. The filing of the “baseless reference” was deemed to be an “affront to the esteemed judiciary” and was regarded as a “blatant abuse” of the legal process, he added.
According to the statement, Justice Kayani had served the judiciary with the “utmost dedication, impartiality and integrity”, adding that the judge’s “unwavering commitment to upholding the rule of law and dispensing justice fairly is commendable and beyond reproach”.
It said it was “imperative” for the legal community as the guardians of justice to “vehemently condemn such malicious attempts to undermine the judiciary and tarnish the reputation of our esteemed judges”, adding that “frivolous references” not only wasted valuable judicial resources but also eroded public trust in the legal system.
The bar council statement added that the IBC unequivocally condemned the filing of the complaint, stood in solidarity with the judge and reaffirmed the body’s unwavering support for judicial independence and integrity. “Let it be known that the legal fraternity will not tolerate any attempts to undermine the sanctity of our judicial institutions,” it concluded.

3,Of ‘protest iftars’ and mingling with other faiths,Muslims in United States experience Ramazan in a multitude of settings.," 

PEOPLE break their fast at the Hussain Masjid in Woodbridge, Virginia, during an Iftar held to promote harmony amongst all sects.—Aziz Jatoi

WASHINGTON: As the sun gently dips below the horizon, marking the end of another day of fasting, I find myself among fellow Muslims gathering for iftar.
The air is tinged with anticipation, my eyes automatically searching for the comforting sight of pakoras, samosas, and Rooh Afza. However, my heart sinks a little; they are nowhere to be found. Resigned, I reach for a simple glass of water.
“Sometimes, it feels fitting to break our fast with something as elemental as water,” muses Shah Jee, a Pakistani-American hailing from Lahore.
Even at a recent iftar at the offices of The Washington Times newspaper, where I had expected a lavish spread, the absence of those cherished delights was palpable. Just as I resigned myself to breaking my fast with water, a stranger, later introduced as Dave, a Jewish man, kindly offered me dates.

Muslims in United States experience Ramazan in a multitude of settings

This iftar at the paper’s offices was hosted by a group of Muslims who recently visited Israel. Though the discourse navigated themes of harmony and shared values among Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the focus was not on the pressing need for peace in Gaza.
Culturally enriching
This Ramazan, the Muslim community has had the privilege of experiencing several other iftars in a multitude of settings.
The most culturally enriching was the iftar in Springfield, Virginia, arranged by a group called Make Space on the evening of Jummatul Wida (the last Friday of Ramazan). It proved to be not only a memorable spiritual occasion but also a distinctive culinary delight for food enthusiasts.
Around 400 participants contributed homemade dishes, fostering a sharing of culinary delights from diverse regions. Amid the feasting, prayers were offered for peace in Gaza and for an immediate ceasefire.
The event was a diverse gathering, with an equal representation of women and men, and it transcended sectarian divides as well, as Make Space discourages such divisions.
‘Protest iftars’
In Washington, one of the major iftars was hosted at the Pakistan Embassy, where a significant number of guests were US officials and diplomats from various nations. The embassy also invited representatives of other religions — Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and Sikhs — to its iftars and encourages them to address the gatherings.
And a Shia Islamic Centre, Shah-i-Najaf, invited their Sunni friends every weekend during this Ramazan. At this, and the Turkish mosque in Lanham, guests witnessed firsthand the spirit of hospitality and generosity that defines Ramazan. Despite theological differences, they came together as one community.
Two ‘protest iftars’ also took place. The first occurred outside the IMF headquarters during a protest organised by PTI USA, leading to the IMF allowing participants to observe iftar and perform Maghrib prayers under their roof.
Subsequently, a coalition of Muslim organisations arranged a protest iftar outside the White House, while President Joe Biden hosted some Muslim leaders at his official residence.
Mosques in New York, however, also served another purpose this Ramazan — sheltering refugees from African countries.
Many mosques opened their doors to these migrants during the daylight hours to rest and recover, oftentimes following restless nights sleeping on the streets or in the subway. During the last 10 days, many spent their nights as well.
Zahid Hussain Bukhari, executive director of the Council for Social Justice in Washington, says there are almost 3,500 mosques in the United States.
“Mosques are increasingly becoming community hubs where Muslims extend invitations to people of other faiths for events like iftar, particularly significant during the last 10 days of Ramazan,” he said.

4,Cop martyred in shooting on outskirts of Peshawar,He was returning home after offering taraveeh prayers at a mosque when he was targeted in Sheikh Muhammadi village.,"PESHAWAR: A police officer was martyred when unidentified attackers targeted him in the Badaber village on the outskirts of provincial capital, late on Monday night, while two militants were killed in an intelligence-based operation in South Waziristan district.
Police said when assistant sub-inspector Maroof Shah was returning home after offering taraveeh prayers at a mosque when he was targeted in Sheikh Muhammadi village on the outskirts of Peshawar.
SSP (Operations) Kashif Zulfiqar said police investigators collected spent bullet casings of 30-bore pistol from the crime scene. He also met the family members of the martyr and assured them that police would ensure arrest of those behind the attack.
Funeral prayers for the martyr ASI were offered at the Malik Saad Shaheed police lines on Tuesday. KP police chief Aktar Hayat Khan, capital city police officer Syed Ashfar Anwar and other senior police and other government officials attended the funeral prayers.
The martyr cop was later laid to rest in his ancestral village.
Two militants killed
Separately, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in South Waziristan district, according to the military’s media wing.
The Inter-Services Public Relations said two militants were killed in an intense fire exchange during the operation.
It said that weapons along with a large quantity of explosives were also recovered from the slain militants, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area as security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country,” the ISPR statement added.

5,"Events may lead to another ‘Dhaka tragedy’, PTI warns","In message from jail, Imran reminds powers that be that countries and institutions can not survive without stable economy.","ISLAMABAD: Drawing a parallel between current developments in Pakistan with the circumstances leading to the 1971 Dhaka tragedy, PTI founding chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan on Tuesday warned that the present situation could result in economic collapse, reminding the powers that be that countries and institutions could not survive without stable economy.
Sharing Mr Khan’s message during a presser at National Press Club after the party’s legal team met him in Adiala Jail, PTI Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan said Salman Akram Raja, Intazar Panjutha, Shoaib Shaheen and Naeem Panjutha were among those who met the incarcerated ex-PM.
Barrister Raja told the media Mr Khan looked determined, though worried for the country and its people. “When you don’t give rights to the people, you cannot say the economy will grow. In 1970, army chief Yahya Khan wanted a hung parliament, but when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s party got a clear majority army held a fraud by-election in which 80 seats of Awami League were snatched as Yahya Khan wanted to become president,” he said, while narrating the PTI founder’s message.
“I want to remind Hamoodur Rahman Commission report that we are again going to repeat the same blunders which we made in the past. In 1970 there was London Plan and today again a government has been imposed through London Plan,” Barrister Raja quoted Mr Khan as saying.
However, he said, time and again he hinted that he was ready to talk to the military establishment, claiming that it would be in the best interest of the country.
On the occasion, Shoaib Shaheen said special prosecutors were not attending hearings in cases against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi due to which proceedings were being delayed.
Intazar Panjutha said Mr Khan compared the current situation of Pakistan with 1971 and warned that it would result in economic collapse and when economy collapses countries and institutions do not survive.

The ECC meeting, held last week, was supposed to approve summaries for the provinces’ cash credit limits, among other matters. During the meeting, it was suggested that the provinces should also be consulted, and their representatives were invited to give their input via Zoom, the official said.
The Ministry of Finance did not issue its customary concluding statement after the meeting ended on April 5.
But a statement issued subsequently said that after considering the views of the relevant federal ministries, ECC members “felt that it would be advisable to include the provincial governments in the deliberations”.

8,PTI slams jail staff for not allowing Imran’s check-up,Core committee terms complaint against IHC’s Justice Kayani part of govt’s efforts to intimidate judges.,"• Party’s core committee terms complaint against IHC’s Justice Kayani part of govt’s efforts to intimidate judges
• KP CM’s aide sees no sign of recovery from ‘worst economic crisis’
ISLAMABAD: Pakist­­an Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) core committee has criticised the Adiala Jail ad­­ministration for not allowing Dr Asim to conduct medical check-up of PTI founding chairman Imran Khan and urged that court take its im­­mediate notice.
The committee emphasised that Dr Asim should be allowed to conduct Mr Khan’s medical examination.
It condemned the complaint filed against Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, a judge of the Islamabad High Court, in the  Supreme Judicial Council.
The panel said the misconduct complaint against Justice Kayani was part of the government’s ongoing efforts to intimidate and coerce judges.
It said the complaint of misconduct against a judge after sending toxic letters to judges who had complained of interference by spy agencies in judicial affairs was part of an organised campaign against the judiciary.
The forum urged Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faiz Isa to take notice of incidents of harassment of judges directly and indirectly to expose the people behind an ‘organised campaign’ against judges and the judiciary.
The committee said the PTI had decided to boycott ‘unconstitutional elections’ for the slots of chairman and deputy chairman of the Senate.
Economic crisis
Meanwhile, adviser to KP chief minister on finance Muzzammil Aslam has said the country is facing the worst-ever economic crisis, with no sign of recovery.
He criticised the government for crushing the people under the burden of back-breaking inflation.
He said that on April 9, 2022, a no-confidence motion was moved against the PTI government over allegations of inflation because the PTI government had put the economy on the path of rapid recovery despite Covid-19 pandemic that played havoc across the world.
The adviser said that in the last year of the PTI government, remittances and exports were at an all-time high, but all hard-earned gains were reversed due to the no-confidence motion against the PTI government.
Mr Muzzammil said the recent World Bank report had revealed that another 10 million Pakistanis would fall below the poverty line.

11,Three brothers get bail in Lahore’s Jinnah House attack case,"Judicial remand of Aliya, Sanam extended in police station attack case.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday granted post-arrest bail to three brothers in the  Lahore Corps Commander House (Jinnah House) attack case. 
A two-judge bench, headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, allowed the petitions of Faizan, Wali and Waqas.
Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq appeared on behalf of the petitioners and argued that police arrested them without any evidence. He said the petitioners were not even present on the alleged occurrence. He said the police could not produce any evidence against the petitioners.
The counsel argued that the petitioners were behind bars for several months without any conviction.
A deputy prosecutor opposed the bail petitions, saying the presence of the suspects at Jinnah House was established through their mobile phones. 

Judicial remand of Aliya, Sanam extended in police station attack case

He said since challan of the case had been submitted to the trial court, the suspects did not deserve bail at this stage. The bench ordered the suspects to furnish bail bonds of Rs100,000 each for their release.
Sarwar Road police had registered a case against the leaders and activists of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf for attacking and ransacking the Jinnah House during the May 9 riots.
During the last two months, over 200 activists, including women, had been granted bail in the Jinnah House attack case by different courts.
Besides terrorism charge under Section 7 of the Anti-terrorism Act 1997, various offences including waging or attempting to wage a war or abetting waging of war against Pakistan, abetting mutiny, or attempting to seduce a soldier from his duty and rioting were added in the FIR.
Judicial remand extended
An anti-terrorism court on Monday extended the judicial remand of PTI’s former MNA Aliya Hamza Malik and social media activist Sanam Javed in Shadman police station attack case.
The police brought both women from Sargodha jail to Lahore’s court for proceedings.
Judge Arshad Javed extended the judicial remand of the women for another 14 days and police took them back to jail.
The judge also adjourned a case of torching police vehicles in the cantonment area against the two women and other leaders of the PTI, including Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Dr Yasmin Rashid and Mian Mahmoodur Rashid.
The suspects had been indicted in this case with the testimony of four prosecution witnesses recorded so far.
The judge postponed three more May 9 cases against the PTI leaders and workers till April 25.

12,Delicate Eid bangles go from furnace to forearms,Soaring gas prices have forced many factories in Hyderabad to close,"HYDERABAD: Layers of intricately decorated bangles are a staple fashion accessory for women in Pakistan, a carefully considered part of their Eidul Fitr celebrations.
More than a dozen people can be involved in the making of a single bangle, from sweltering factories to the homes of designers who skilfully decorate them by hand.
“Whatever the fashion trends, when we attend any event and wear any outfit it feels incomplete without bangles,” said 42-year-old Talat Zahid, who uses beads, stitching and embroidery to embellish bangles.
“Even if you don’t wear jewellery but wear bangles or a bracelet with your outfit, the outfit looks complete.” In the lead-up to this week’s Eidul Fitr festivities that mark the end of Ramazan, market stalls are adorned with a glittering array of colourful bangles, each turned over and inspected for their beauty and imperfections by women who haggle for a good price.

Soaring gas prices have forced many factories in Hyderabad to close

They are often sold by the dozen, starting at around Rs150 (about 50 cents) and rising to Rs1,000 as stones and silk are added.
Hyderabad is home to the delicate “churi” glass bangle, where a single furnace can produce up to 100 bangles an hour from molten glass wire shaped around an iron rod.
The work is arduous and frustrating — labourers are exposed to oppressive temperatures in unregulated factories prone to frequent power cuts, while the fragile glass threads can snap easily.
“The work is done without a fan. If we turn on the fan the fire is extinguished. So the heat intensity is high. As it becomes hotter our work slows down,” said 24-year-old Sameer, who followed his father into the industry and earns less than the minimum wage of Rs32,000 ($115) a month.
After the partition of British-ruled India in 1947, migrating Muslims who had produced bangles in the Indian city of Firozabad took their trade to Hyderabad -- where hundreds of thousands of people rely on the industry.
But soaring gas prices after the government slashed subsidies have forced many factories to close or to operate at reduced hours.
“The speed at which the government has increased the gas prices and taxes, (means) the work in this area has started to shrink instead of expand,” said 50-year-old factory owner Muhammad Nafees.
Most bangles leave the factory as plain loops, sent off to be embellished to different degrees by women who work from home, before they’re finally passed on to traders to be sold in markets.
The production is often a family affair.
Saima Bibi, 25, works from home, carefully adding stones to bangles with the help of her three children when they return from school, while her husband works at the furnaces.
“They go through a lot of hands to be prepared,” she said.

13,"US calls upon Pakistan, India not to escalate tensions","Says it does not have ""any comments on underlined allegations"" of Indian agents carrying out killings in Pakistan.","WASHINGTON: The US State Department urged India and Pakistan on Monday not to escalate tensions and resolve their disputes through dialogue.
“We have been following the media reports about this issue,” said the department’s spokesperson Matthew Miller when asked to comment on media reports that Indian government agents had carried out assassinations inside Pakistan.
“We don’t have any comment on the underlined allegations.”
 
 

The US official, however, said that while Washington was not going to “get in the middle of this situation”, it would “encourage both sides to avoid escalation and find a resolution through dialogue”.
Britain’s The Guardian newspaper reported last week that the Indian government had “assassinated individuals in Pakistan as part of a wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil”.
In a later report, the newspaper noted that India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, in a recent statement, confirmed that his government carried out extrajudicial killings in Pakistan.
Responding to another question, Mr Miller said the US secretary of state spoke with Pakistan’s foreign minister on Friday to “reaffirm our robust partnership which advances the prosperity of Pakistan and the US.”
The two diplomats discussed the importance of continued cooperation on counterterrorism, ex­­panding trade and investment partnership, and advancing women’s economic security and empowerment, Mr Miller added.

IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq took up the petition filed by Dr Zarqa Suharwardy Taimur, Falak Naz, Fawzia Arshad, Saifullah Sarwar Khan Nyazee and Saifullah Abro. 
The petitioners’ counsel informed the court that the election process involves secret balloting, with members casting votes for candidates contesting from their respective provinces. 
It said that election to 11 seats of the Senate having fallen vacant in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province had been postponed for the reason that the members of the KP Assembly, purportedly elected on the reserved as provided under Article 106 of the constitution, had not taken the oath and thus the electoral college was incomplete. 

Five PTI senators tell IHC April 9 election cannot take place as the house is not complete

The election for the reserved seats in the KP Assembly was to be held on April 2, the petition said, adding that “it has been widely reported that a session of an “incomplete” Senate has been summoned on April 9 to hold elections of chairman and deputy chairman.  
It may be noted that election to the 11 seats of Senate from KP was postponed after the speaker refused to administer oath to those who had been declared returned candidates to reserved seats of the provincial legislature leaving the house. 
According to the PTI senators’ petition, the election to the office of chairman and deputy chairman Senate cannot be held in the absence of members from KP. 
“Under Article 60 of the Cons­titution, the election to the offices of Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Senate can only be held after the Senate has been duly constituted,” the petition pointed out. 
The petition requested the court to postpone the elections of chairman and deputy chairman till the house is complete. 
After preliminary hearing, Justice Farooq held that the petition was maintainable.
However, he said the court would seek assistance to determine if it has jurisdiction to interfere in such matters or not. 
The court issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Senate Secretariat and adjourned hearing. 
The ECP had earlier denied the reserved seats to the PTI-Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) and the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.  
Moved by SIC Chairman Sahibzada Mohammad Hamid Raza, the petition before the Supreme Court seeks the setting aside of the Peshawar High Court’s March 14 judgement that had upheld the ECP’s direction. 
The SIC was earlier joined by the PTI-backed independent candidates after they won the Feb 8 elections, since Imran Khan’s party had been deprived of its electoral symbol ‘bat’.

16,Competition Commission of Pakistan to assess impact of public investment companies on sector,Study also aims to evaluate the government’s footprint on key sectors through state-owned ente­r­­p­rises.,"ISLAMABAD: The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has commenced a study rega­rding the assessment of the insurance sector.
The study will evaluate whether public sector insurance companies were hindering the gro­wth of insurance market in the country.
The study, being conducted under IMF’s Public Investment Management Assessment framework, aims to evaluate the government’s footprint on key sectors through state-owned ente­r­­p­rises and its implications for competition and the overall economic landscape.
It will also examine the role of SOEs in insurance and reinsurance markets and analyse why this sector is underdeveloped. It will also examine how the market can be opened up to international players.
Privatising state-owned insurance firms is desirable to diminish public sector dominance, attract foreign investment and create a level playing field for the private sector to boost insurance penetration.
