Lavrov arrived in China for a two-day official visit on Monday, with the two countries looking to deepen diplomatic ties as Russia’s war in Ukraine grinds on.
Russia and China have in recent years ramped up contacts, and their strategic partnership has only grown closer since the invasion of Ukraine.
In meetings on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Wang Yi promised:  “China will support Russia’s stable development under the leadership of (Vladimir) Putin.”  “Beijing and Moscow will continue to strengthen strategic cooperation on the world stage and provide each other with strong support,” Wang said, according to the RIA Novosti news agency.
“Under the strong leadership of President Putin, the Russian people will have a bright future,” he said. Lavrov, in turn, thanked China for its  “support” after President Putin’s recent re-election, in which he was unchallenged by any meaningful opposition.
“Xi Jinping... was among the first ones to send congratulations to the president-elect Putin, and we are overall grateful to our Chinese friends for this support,” Lavrov said, according to a video of the meeting shared by Izvestia on Telegram.
“The election results confirmed the deep trust of the Russian people in our leader and the ongoing domestic and foreign policies,” he added, according to RIA Novosti.
“This applies not least to the course to strengthen strategic interaction and partnership with the PRC,” the top diplomat said, referring to China by its official acronym.
‘Clear-cut stand’
Lavrov last visited Beijing in October for an international forum on Chinese President Xi’s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. Analysts say China holds the upper hand in the relationship with Russia, with its sway growing as Moscow’s international isolation deepens following its invasion of Ukraine.
That asymmetry is still  “changing in China’s favour” as it enables Moscow  “to continue the war by providing very necessary materials for the Russian war machine”, Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre, said.
“Integrating Russia’s economy, brainpower, and military technology into...
a Chinese-led order with Eurasia at its geographic heart, is the only way Russia can sustain its confrontation with the West,” he wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this week.
“China has stronger bargaining power and many more options than does Russia, and its leverage over its northern neighbour is growing all the time,” he added.
“Russia is now locking itself into vassalage to China.” 
US officials have recently warned Beijing against providing indirect aid to the Russian war effort and regularly urge China to wield its influence to help bring about peace in Ukraine.
In Brussels last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that  “China continues to provide materials to support Russia’s defence industrial base”.
And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who wrapped up a visit to China on Monday, said she had warned officials of the consequences of supporting Russia’s military procurement.

1,Shipwreck off Djibouti leaves  38 migrants dead,"ADDIS ABABA: The bodies of 38 migrants, including children, have been recovered after a shipwreck off the Horn of...","ADDIS ABABA: The bodies of 38 migrants, including children, have been recovered after a shipwreck off the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti, the UN said on Tuesday, the latest disaster on the so-called Eastern migration route.
The UN’s International Organisation for Migration said that the boat was carrying 66 people when it sank in the early hours of Monday. The tragedy took place just 200 metres (yards) off the coast of Godoria in the northeast of Djibouti, the agency said.
“Thirty-eight bodies have been recovered. 22 survivors are being assisted by IOM and local authorities,” IOM regional spokesperson Yvonne Ngede said.
She said those on the boat included women, children and babies and that most of them were believed to be Ethiopian nationals.
In a post on X accompanied by a picture of white body bags lined up on a beach, the IOM said at least six other people were missing and presumed dead after the  “tragic shipwreck”.
The Ethiopian embassy in Djibouti said the accident involved a boat carrying around 60 Ethiopian migrants from Djibouti to war-torn Yemen.
Each year, many tens of thousands of African migrants brave the perilous  “Eastern Route” across the Red Sea and through war-scarred Yemen to reach Saudi Arabia, escaping conflict, or natural disaster or seeking better economic opportunities.
“On their journeys, many face life-threatening dangers including starvation, health risks and exploitation — at the hands of human traffickers and other criminals,” the IOM said in a statement in February.
Africa’s second most populous country, Ethiopia is blighted by various conflicts and several regions have suffered from severe drought in recent years. More than 15 percent of its some 120 million inhabitants depend on food aid.
The Ethiopian embassy in Djibouti said that in the last five years, 189 of its citizens making the journey had lost their lives in boat accidents alone.

2,Five policemen shot dead in Iran’s southeast,"According to Iranian news agency Tasnim, two police vehicles came under fire along a road in Sistan-Baluchistan.","TEHRAN: At least five Iranian police officers were killed on Tuesday in an attack in the restive Sistan-Baluchistan province in the country’s southeast, state TV reported.
Local media reported that Jaish al-Adl had claimed responsibility for the shooting, but a local official said criminal gangs were to blame.
“A number of armed miscreants in the region attacked a police patrol,” Alireza Marhamati, deputy governor of Sistan-Baluchistan province told state TV.
“Five of our dear policemen were martyred and one person was injured there,” he said.
Marhamati added that security forces were looking for the attackers, insisting they were not Jaish al-Adl members.
“It is not their job,” he said, arguing the jihadists had claimed the attack  “to make themselves bigger”.
According to Iranian news agency Tasnim, two police vehicles came under fire along a road in Sistan-Baluchistan, long plagued by unrest involving drug-smuggling gangs, rebels from the Baluch and Sunni extremists.
Last week militants from Jaish al-Adl — branded a  “terrorist” organisation by Iran and the United States — killed 16 security personnel in one of their deadliest attacks in years, also in Sistan-Baluchistan.
The fatalities included law enforcement officials, members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and paramilitary Basij forces, according to a Tasnim report which said US weapons and technology were seized from the  “terrorists”.State media said that Iranian police had arrested three suspected members of the militant Islamic State group over plans to carry out attacks at the end of Ramazan.
Official news agency IRNA reported that the arrests had been made in the northwestern city of Karaj but did not specify when or elaborate on the suspects’ identities.

3,"Hepatitis viruses kill 3,500 people a day","GENEVA: More than 3,500 people die from hepatitis viruses every day and the global toll is rising, the World Health...","GENEVA: More than 3,500 people die from hepatitis viruses every day and the global toll is rising, the World Health Organisation warned on Tuesday, calling for swift action to fight the second-largest infectious killer.
New data from 187 countries showed that the number of deaths from viral hepatitis rose to 1.3 million in 2022 from 1.1 million in 2019, according to a WHO report released to coincide with the World Hepatitis Summit in Portugal this week.
These are  “alarming trends,” Meg Doherty, head of the WHO’s global HIV, hepatitis and sexually-transmitted infection programmes, told a press conference.
The report said that there are 3,500 deaths per day worldwide from hepatitis infections — 83 per cent from hepatitis B, 17 percent from hepatitis C. There are effective and cheap generic drugs which can treat these viruses.
Yet only three per cent of those with chronic hep B received antiviral treatment by the end of 2022, the report said. For hep C, just 20pc — or 12.5 million people — had been treated.
“These results fall well below the global targets to treat 80pc of all people living with chronic hep B and C by 2030,” Doherty said. The overall rate of hepatitis infections did fall slightly.

4,Kazakhstan and Russia battle huge floods,ASTANA: Water levels in overflowing rivers were still rising on Tuesday in swathes of Russia and Kazakhstan that ...,"ASTANA: Water levels in overflowing rivers were still rising on Tuesday in swathes of Russia and Kazakhstan that have been hit by massive floods, with Russia’s city of Orenburg and western Siberia bracing for a new peak.
Both Astana and Moscow have called the floods the worst in decades, introducing a state of emergency as water covered entire cities and villages. More than 100,000 people have been evacuated from the rising water — mostly in Kazakhstan.
The Kremlin said the situation remains  “difficult” in large parts of Russia but insisted that President Vladimir Putin has — so far — no plans to visit the zone. The neighbours have pledged to cooperate on battling the floods.
“Since the beginning of the floods, more than 86,000 people have been rescued and evacuated,” the Kazakh government said on Tuesday.
It said that 8,472 of the evacuees were in temporary housing, with the rest believed to be in safe places in the community. Kazakhstan also said it had taken 81,000 animals to safety.

5,Top Europe court chides Switzerland in landmark climate ruling,Swiss government says it would examine measures it should take following the ruling.,"STRASBOURG: Europe’s top rights court on Tuesday said Switzerland was not doing enough to tackle climate change in a historic decision that could force governments to adopt more ambitious climate policies.
The European Court of Human Rights, part of the 46-member Council of Europe, however, threw out two other climate cases against European states on procedural grounds.
Hopes had been high for a legal turning point ahead of the rulings in the three cases, treated as a priority by the 17 judges of the court’s Grand Chamber.
In the first case, the court found that the Swiss state had violated Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the  “right to respect for private and family life”, according to the ruling.
The Swiss association of Elders for Climate Protection — 2,500 women aged 73 on average — had complained about the  “failings of the Swiss authorities” in terms of climate protection that could  “seriously harm” their health.
The court found  “there were some critical lacunae” in relevant Swiss regulations, including a failure to quantify limits on national greenhouse gas emissions. The court ordered the Swiss state to pay the association 80,000 euros (almost $87,000) within three months. The lawyer of the Swiss association, Cordelia Bahr, said the court had  “established that climate protection was a human right”.
“It’s a huge victory for us and a legal precedent for all the states of the Council of Europe,” she said. Climate activist Greta Thunberg said it was  “only the beginning of climate litigation”.
“All over the world more and more people are taking their government to court, holding them responsible for their actions,” she said inside the court after attending the rulings.
‘Historic’
Joie Chowdhury, a lawyer from the Centre for International Environmental Law, said the ruling was  “historic”. “We expect this ruling to influence climate action and climate litigation across Europe and far beyond,” she said.
It “leaves no doubt: the climate crisis is a human rights crisis, and states have human rights obligations to act urgently and effectively… to prevent further devastation and harm to people and the environment,” she said.
Gerry Liston, of the NGO Global Legal Action Network, said before the rulings that a victory in any of the three cases could constitute  “the most significant legal development on climate change for Europe since the signing of the Paris 2015 Agreement”.
The Paris Agreement set targets for governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The Swiss government said it would examine measures it should take following the ruling. Alain Chablais, the lawyer who represented Switzerland in court, warned it might take  “some time”.
The hard-right Swiss People’s Party, the country’s largest political party but which has only two of seven seats in the government, called the decision a  “scandal” and an  “interference” in domestic policy, and called for Switzerland to withdraw from the Council of Europe.

6,Simon Harris becomes Ireland’s youngest prime minister,"DUBLIN: Simon Harris on Tuesday became Ireland’s new prime minister, replacing Leo Varadkar after he abruptly quit...","DUBLIN: Simon Harris on Tuesday became Ireland’s new prime minister, replacing Leo Varadkar after he abruptly quit last month citing personal and political reasons.
Ireland’s parliament voted 88 to 69 in favour of Harris, 37, becoming  “taoiseach” — a Gaelic word for  “chieftain” or  “leader” pronounced  “tee-shock”. He was officially installed later at a ceremony with President Michael D. Higgins, becoming the country’s youngest ever prime minister.
The centre-right Fine Gael party — part of a three-party governing coalition — selected Harris as its leader following an uncontested election after Varadkar announced his resignation.
On accepting the nomination on Tuesday, Harris told parliament:  “I commit to doing everything that I can to honour the trust that you have placed in me today. “This is very much a partnership government and I intend to lead us in the spirit of unity, collaboration and mutual respect,” he said, watched on by his wife and two children.
“I want to bring new ideas and new energy and, I hope, a new empathy to public life. Time is certainly short, and there’s a lot to do,” Harris added. Vara­dkar, who was in his second stint as prime minister and at 45 was one of Europe’s youngest leaders, said last month that he felt he was no longer the  “best person” to lead the country. The outgoing leader, who himself was the youngest taoiseach when first elected in 2017, on Tuesday said that he  “always knew” Harris would fill the top job.

7,Hamas says Israeli proposal fails  to meet Palestinian demands,Will review the proposal further and go back to the mediators with its response.,"CAIRO: Hamas said on Tuesday that an Israeli proposal on a ceasefire did not meet the demands of Palestinian factions, but it would study the offer further and deliver its response to mediators.
The proposal was handed to the Palestinian movement by Egyptian and Qatari mediators at talks in Cairo that aim to find a way out of the crisis in the Gaza Strip, now in its seventh month.
Residents said Israeli forces kept up airstrikes on Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza and Rafah on the enclave’s southern edge on Tuesday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly flagged plans for a ground assault on Rafah, where more than one million displaced civilians are holed up, despite international pleas for restraint.
The talks in Cairo, also attended by the director of the US Central Intelligence Agency William Burns, have so far failed to reach a breakthrough towards pausing the Israeli aggression.
“The movement (Hamas) is interested in reaching an agreement that puts an end to the aggression on our people. Despite that, the Israeli position remains intransigent and it didn’t meet any of the demands of our people and our resistance,” Hamas said in a statement following the latest ceasefire proposal.
It said it would review the proposal further and go back to the mediators with its response.
Hamas wants any agreement to secure an end to the Israeli military offensive, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and to allow displaced people to return to their homes across the small, densely populated enclave.
Israel wants to secure the release of prisoners seized by Hamas in the Oct 7 cross-border raid. The United States is pushing hard for a ceasefire, after telling its ally Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza and let in more aid to prevent a famine.
In Washington, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said 400 aid trucks had been cleared to enter Gaza the previous day, describing it as the most since the crisis started six months ago. He said a good ceasefire offer had been presented to Hamas, which should accept it.
Israel pulled back most of its ground forces from southern Gaza this week after months of fighting, but still says it plans to launch an assault on Rafah, on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, where more than half of Gazans are now sheltering.
In one of the first signs of concrete preparations for a ground assault, Israeli media reported on Tuesday that the Israeli defence ministry was purchasing 40,000 tents ahead of an evacuation of the city.
Netanyahu said Israel’s aims were to release the prisoners and to secure total victory over Hamas. Of the 253 people Hamas seized on Oct 7, 133 prisoners remain captive.Negotiators have spoken of around 40 going free in the first stage of a deal.
Palestinian emergency teams supported by international organisations scoured the rubble of Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City and the shattered city of Khan Younis in the south following the withdrawal of Israeli troops.
So far the teams have recovered 409 bodies of Palestinians killed in the hospital and its surrounding neighbourhood and in Khan Younis, according to Mahmoud Basal, spokesperson for the Hamas-run Gaza Civil Emer­gency Service.

8,Physicist who discovered Higgs boson dies,"LONDON: British physicist Peter Higgs, whose theory of a mass-giving particle — the so-called Higgs boson —...","LONDON: British physicist Peter Higgs, whose theory of a mass-giving particle — the so-called Higgs boson — jointly earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics, has died aged 94, the University of Edinburgh announced on Tuesday.
“He passed away peacefully at home on Monday April 8 following a short illness,” the Scottish university, where he had been a professor for nearly five decades, said in a statement.
It called him  “a great teacher and mentor, inspiring generations of young scientists”.
“His family has asked that the media and public respect their privacy at this time,” the university added.
Higgs used ground-breaking theoretical work to help explain how the Universe has mass, thus resolving one of the greatest puzzles in physics and earning him a place alongside Albert Einstein and Max Planck in textbooks.
His 1964 theory of a mass-giving particle, which became known as the Higgs boson, won him and Belgian physicist Francois Englert the 2013 physics Nobel Prize. That followed experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) finally confirming the theory the previous year, nearly half a century on.
“Peter Higgs was a remarkable individual — a truly gifted scientist whose vision and imagination have enriched our knowledge of the world that surrounds us,” Peter Mathieson, Vice Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh, said.
“His pioneering work has motivated thousands of scientists, and his legacy will continue to inspire many more for generations to come.”

9,Australia hints it could recognise Palestinian state,"SYDNEY: Australia on Tuesday became the latest country to advocate formal recognition of a Palestinian state, ...","SYDNEY: Australia on Tuesday became the latest country to advocate formal recognition of a Palestinian state, further shattering a long-standing diplomatic taboo in the West.
Foreign Minister Penny Wong said that recognising a state of Palestine could restart the moribund Middle East peace process and undermine extremist forces in the Middle East.
“Recognising a Palestinian state — one that can only exist side by side with a secure Israel — doesn’t just offer the Palestinian people an opportunity to realise their aspirations”, she told an audience in Canberra.
“It also strengthens the forces for peace, and undermines extremism. It undermines Hamas, Iran and Iran’s other destructive proxies in the region.” For decades, the formal recognition of a Palestinian state has been seen as the endgame of a peace process between Palestinians and their Israeli neighbours.
The United States, Australia and most Western European nations have said they are willing to one day recognise Palestinian statehood, but not before agreement on thorny issues like the status of Jerusalem and final borders are agreed.“The failures of this approach by all parties over decades — as well as the Netanyahu Government’s refusal to even engage on the question of a Palestinian state — have caused widespread frustration,” Wong said.
“So the international community is now considering the question of Palestinian statehood as a way of building momentum towards a two-state solution,” she added.
Her comments come after the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, Slovenia and Spain have floated the idea of recognising a Palestinian state.
In 2014, Sweden, which has a large Palestinian community, became the first EU member in western Europe to recognise a Palestinian state.
Sanchez to lobby for Palestinian state
Spanish  Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will meet several of his European Union  counterparts over the next week to try to garner support for the  recognition of a Palestinian state, the government said on Tuesday.
Sanchez’s  agenda includes meetings with the prime ministers of Norway, Ireland,  Portugal, Slovenia and 
Belgium focusing on the EU’s position regarding  the  Gaza Strip, government spokesperson Pilar  Alegria told reporters.

10,Russians take to the streets in flooded city,Record floods in Urals triggered by melting snow,"MOSCOW: Russia on Monday warned of  “unprecedented” flooding over the next 48 hours as locals in a city partially submerged by rising waters took to the streets in rare protest at the authorities’ handling of the crisis.
Fast-melting ice and torrential rain have caused major rivers — the Ural and Tobol — near the Russian border with Kazakhstan to overflow, with officials warning the flood waters are set to rise dangerously high over the next 48 hours.
Dozens of protestors in the city of Orsk, which was submerged in metres of flood water over the weekend after a dam burst, on Monday protested against the government’s weak response in a rare show of dissent in Russia.
Videos posted by local social media channels showed the crowds shouting,  “Shame! Shame! Shame!” and  “Putin, help!” The Kremlin earlier on Monday said that the Russian president had no plans to visit the flooded areas. Public demonstrations against the government are illegal in Russia under strict anti-protest laws.

Record floods in Urals triggered by melting snow

The Orenburg regional prosecutor’s office, which covers Orsk, explicitly on Monday warned residents that they faced arrest if they participated in  “unauthorised” rallies.
The protesters were demanding more financial help and were angry that a dam designed to protect the city had burst.
In a compensation scheme published over the weekend, the regional government said it would pay up to 100,000 roubles ($1,100) per person for household items  “completely destroyed” in the floods. The Orenburg governor on Monday said that it would fully reimburse the cost of damage to housing, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported.
‘Do not wait’
In Orsk, the worst affected city so far, 99 people were treated for injuries with nine people admitted to hospital, state media cited health officials as saying. More cities, including the regional hub of Orenburg with a population of 550,000, were bracing for a surge in water levels over the coming days. Governors in the neighbouring 
regions of Kurgan and Tyumen each introduced a state of emergency.
“The flood forecast is rapidly deteriorating, much more water is arriving, and faster,” Vadim Shumkov, the governor of the Kurgan region said in a post on Telegram. He called on people to evacuate while they still could.
“Everyone who lives in settlements along the floodplain of the Tobol River: evacuate. Do not wait for the water to come. It will come at night and unexpectedly, quickly arriving in the form of a large wave,” Shumkov said in a post on Telegram.
The regional capital, also called Kurgan, is home to 300,000 people and sits on the river.
Water levels were receding in Orsk on Monday but had risen close to dangerous levels in the city of Orenburg. The Kremlin called the situation  “critical” and said it would likely  “worsen”.
“Nature has caused a lot of inconvenience. But the local residents are handling it stoically, as are the local authorities,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, hours before the protests in Orsk. Thousands of people have been evacuated from flooded areas.
The Emergency Situations ministry on Monday said that more than 10,000 residential buildings had been flooded, mostly in the Urals, Volga area and western Siberia.

11,27 go on trial in Panama Papers tax evasion case,"Leaked trove of 11.5m files from a law firm implicated influential figures, including billionaires, politicians and sports stars.","PANAMA CITY: Twenty-seven people went on trial on Monday in connection with the  “Panama Papers” tax evasion scandal, with one of the main defendants denying accusations of money laundering.
The 2016 leaks revealed how many of the world’s wealthy stashed assets in offshore companies, exposing high-profile personalities and triggering scores of investigations around the globe.
The defendants on trial include Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca Mora, the founders of the now-defunct law firm at the centre of the scandal, as well as other lawyers and former employees.
They are charged with money laundering and if convicted face up to 12 years in prison.

Leaked trove of 11.5m files from a law firm implicated influential figures, including billionaires, politicians and sports stars

Mossack, 76, said at the hearing that he was  “not responsible” for alleged crimes.
Earlier he told journalists outside the court he was  “very optimistic” and that  “if there is real justice” then he would be cleared.
Defence lawyer Dionicio Rodriguez said the case was  “a trial against the Panamanian legal profession” because  “activities are being prosecuted that are legal in many other countries in the world.” Fonseca, 71, did not attend because he was in the hospital, according to his lawyer.
The leaked trove of 11.5 million files from the law firm Mossack Fonseca implicated influential figures including billionaires, politicians and even sports stars.
Icelandic prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson was forced to resign after it was revealed his family had offshore accounts. Others implicated included former British premier David Cameron, football star Lionel Messi, Argentina’s then-president Mauricio Macri and Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar, to name but a few.
The files were leaked to a German newspaper, Sueddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Many of those caught up in the scandal put forward reasons to explain their offshore presence and said they did not act illegally. Even so, Mossack Fonseca said in 2018 that it would close due to  “irreparable damage” to its reputation.
‘More action needed’
The scandal dealt a severe blow to Panama’s image as an offshore financial hub. The country subsequently carried out legal reforms that led to its removal from the Financial Action Task Force’s  “gray list” of jurisdictions under increased monitoring.
The Paris-based organisation decided that Panama had made progress in the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing. But the Central American nation remains on a European Union tax haven blacklist.
“Eight years later, changes are happening, but more action is needed,” Olga de Obaldia, executive director of Transparency Inter­national in Panama, said.
The fact that some of its current laws against money laundering did not exist when the Panama Papers revelations emerged could complicate efforts to achieve convictions, according to legal experts.
“The crux of the matter is whether a crime was committed in Panama or not under the regulations at the time,” Carlos Barsallo, a jurist and former head of Transparency International’s Panama office, said.
According to Barsallo, in 2021 the Supreme Court exonerated a Mossack Fonseca employee by indicating that her actions at that time were not a crime in Panama.
“It may generate confusion and frustration in the international community if this is the outcome after so many years and so much news,” he said.

12,Vatican opposes criminalisation  of homosexuality,"Under Pope Francis, the Catholic Church has become more welcoming towards LGBT people.","VATICAN CITY: The Vatican opposes the criminalisation of homosexuality as practised by a number of countries with the support of Catholic groups, the head of the Vatican’s doctrine office said on Monday.
Presenting a publication which reaffirmed the Vatican’s opposition to sex changes, gender theory and surrogate parenthood, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez called laws punishing homosexuality  “a big problem” and said:  “of course we are not in favour of criminalisation.” 
Fernandez, a liberal theologian whom Pope Francis appointed as head of the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith less than a year ago, told reporters it was  “painful” to see some Catholics support anti-homosexuality laws.
In February 2023, returning from a trip to Africa where same-sex relationships are often taboo, Pope Francis said laws criminalising LGBT people were a sin and an injustice, because God loves and accompanies people with same-sex attraction.
“The criminalisation of homosexuality is a problem that cannot be ignored,” the pope said, citing unnamed statistics according to which 50 countries criminalise LGBT people  “in one way or another” and about 10 others have laws including the death penalty.
Under Pope Francis, the Catholic Church has become more welcoming towards LGBT people. In December, Cardinal Fernandez’s office issued a landmark document allowing the blessing of same-sex couples, triggering substantial conservative backlash.
Nevertheless, the Church officially teaches that homosexual acts  “are intrinsically disordered”.
Answering a question on whether such language may be amended, Cardinal Fernandez said,  “it is true that it a very strong expression and that it needs a lot of explanation, perhaps we could find a clearer one.”
He said that the point of Catholic teaching was that homosexual acts cannot match  “the immense beauty” of heterosexual unions, and the Church  “could find more apt words to express” this.

Born in 1992, the man — identified only by the initials S.I. — had been on the run and used various aliases and nationalities, including claiming to be from Uzbekistan, Kyrgystan and Ukraine.
He was arrested at Rome’s Fiumicino airport after arriving on a flight from Eindhoven in the Netherlands on Monday morning, police said in a statement. He had been subject to an international arrest warrant.
His arrest was part of broader  “preventive” action by Italian authorities, police said, noting also the  “extreme delicacy of the current international background”.
They did not elaborate, nor did they give further details about how he was tracked down, although Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi highlighted the importance of working with police in other countries.
In a statement, Piantedosi hailed the arrest as a  “very important result” by law enforcement authorities working to  “counter the terrorist threat”.

While India’s 220 million Muslims make up a little under a fifth of its 1.4 billion population, Muslim representatives in parliament have almost halved to less than five per cent since the 1970s.
“Everyone wants a connect with BJP,” said Ghanshyam Singh Lodhi, who is confident of re-election as MP for Rampur in Uttar Pradesh state when the six-week-long elections begin on April 19.
Lodhi, a Hindu, replaced Rampur’s Muslim MP in a 2022 by-election, jumping ship from the last lawmaker’s party to become a BJP loyalist.
Muslim leaders worry at the lack of representation. There were just 27 Muslim MPs in the 543-seat lower house in parliament — and none of them were among the BJP’s 310 lawmakers.
Ziya Us Salam, author of a book on Muslims in India, says members of the faith had for decades placed their trust in secular parties, a process that created an  “acute absence of Muslim leadership”.
Today, an overtly Muslim leader would be challenged as stoking sectarian divisions, yet few question when Modi champions constitutionally secular India as a  “Hindu Rashtra”, or Hindu state. “Nobody talks of (Modi) being the leader of only Hindus,” Salam said.
He also argues that successive gerrymandering policies since independence in 1947 have redrawn electoral boundaries to split areas with substantial Muslim populations.
‘Not able to vote’
Rampur has elected Muslim MPs 15 out of 18 times since 1952. But Kanwal Bharti, a 71-year-old activist and writer from the city, said the BJP’s dominance means that it  “doesn’t seem possible anymore” for a Muslim candidate to win Rampur.
Rampur’s last Muslim MP was veteran politician Mohammad Azam Khan — but he quit after more than 80 legal cases were brought against him, ranging from land grabbing to intimidating government officials.
His supporters said many of the accusations were years old and that charges had only been belatedly brought after the BJP won state elections in 2017. Khan was jailed for three years in 2023 for hate speech against BJP rivals.
Past elections were marred by allegations that security forces blocked Muslims from voting.
A legal challenge that a 2022 parliamentary by-election vote was manipulated  “by using every unconstitutional means” to stop voters from Muslim-dominated areas was dismissed on a technicality.
Some Muslim voters in Rampur worry about casting a ballot later this month.
“If the conditions during the last election are repeated, I will again not be able to vote,” said 75-year-old Mohammad Salam Khan, reading a newspaper in his son’s electrical repair shop.

15,"Swapping of the Guard: French, British troops mark Entente Cordiale",LONDON: French and British troops on Monday swapped roles to take part in changing of the guard ceremonies outside...,"LONDON: French and British troops on Monday swapped roles to take part in changing of the guard ceremonies outside the palaces of the other country’s head of state, in an unprecedented move to celebrate 120 years since the Entente Cordiale. Signed in 1904, the Entente Cordiale accord cemented an improvement in relations after the Napoleonic Wars and is seen as the foundation of the two Nato members’ alliance to this day.
Even after Brexit and with war back in Europe,  “this entente cordiale is somehow the cornerstone... that allows us to maintain the bilateral relationship”, French President Emmanuel Macron said in a video address on X, formerly Twitter.
“Long live the entente cordiale and long live the Franco-British friendship,” he said, switching to English. Macron and British ambassador to France Menna Rawlings on Monday morning watched British guards taking part in the changing of the guard outside his Elysee Palace.
French guards then did the same in London outside Buckingham Palace, the official residence of King Charles III.
At the Elysee, 16 members of the Number 7 Company Coldstream Guards of the UK embassy, wearing their traditional bearskin hats, relieved French counterparts from the first infantry regiment. The French army choir then sang the two national anthems — God Save the King and La Marseillaise.
British Foreign Minister David Cameron and his French counterpart, Stephane Sejourne, celebrated their countries’  “close friendship” in a joint op-ed published late on Sunday. 
They said it was key at a time when Nato is mobilised to ensure Ukraine does not lose its fight to repel the Russian invasion.

THESE photos, taken in Mazatlan (Mexico), Fort Worth (Texas) and Bloomington (Indiana) — along the so-called ‘Path of Totality’ — show the stages of the total solar eclipse that was visible in parts of North America, on Monday.—Reuters / AFP

 
MAZATLAN: The first total solar eclipse to grace North America in seven years made landfall in Mexico on Monday as millions of skywatchers gazed upward for the start of a celestial display at least partially visible, weather permitting, across most of the continent. 
The Mexican beachside resort town of Mazatlan was the first major viewing spot along the “path of totality” in North America. 
Thousands of people gathered along the coastal promenade, setting themselves up in deck chairs with solar-safe eyewear as an orchestra played the “Star Wars” movie theme. The crowds burst into cheers and applause and the eclipse reached totality. 
Where clear skies prevail, observers along the direct path of the eclipse were being treated to the rare spectacle of the moon appearing as a dark orb creeping in front of the sun, briefly blocking out all but a brilliant halo of light, or corona, around, the sun’s outer edge. 
The period of totality, lasting up to 4 1/2 minutes depending the observer’s location, was ushered in by a number of other eerie eclipse effects. A partial eclipse, in which the moon obscures only a portion of the sun, was unfolding across most of the continental United States. At Mazatlan, Lourdes Corro, 43, traveled 10 hours by car to get there.
“The last one I saw was when I was 9 years old,” Corro said. “There are a few clouds but we can still see the sun.” 
Eclipse fans are gathering in numerous places along the “path of totality,” which stretches from Mexico’s Pacific Coast through Texas and across 14 other US states into Canada. 
In upstate New York, at the Frontier Town campground in North Hudson, children ran around wearing eclipse T-shirts, while parents set up tables, chairs and beer coolers. 
Connecticut residents Bob and Teresa Love were stretched out in the cargo bed of their pickup truck, eating pastries and hoping the forecasted clouds hold off long enough to not obscure the spectacle. 
“I’m trying not to get too excited because of weather, just trying to keep expectations real,” said Teresa, 49. “Some people say it’s life-changing. I don’t know if it’s going to be life-changing, but I think it’s going to be cool to see.” 
At up to 4 minutes and 28 seconds, the total eclipse of 2024 surpasses the duration of the one that traversed the United States from coast to coast in 2017. That one clocked in at up to two minutes and 42 seconds. According to NASA, total eclipses can last anywhere from 10 seconds to about 7-1/2 minutes. 
Some other cities along the path of totality include: San Antonio, Austin and Dallas, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Cleveland, Ohio; Erie, Pennsylvania; both Niagara Falls, New York, and Niagara Falls, Ontario, site of the famed waterfall, and Montreal, Quebec. 
About 32 million people in the US live within the path of totality, with federal officials predicting another five million people will travel to be there. Countless eclipse-watching events were being convened at bars, stadiums, fairgrounds and parks along the path of totality. 
Small rural towns bustled, such as Advance, Missouri, home to just over 1,300 people, where Tim and Gwen Wurst had driven from their Kansas City home after checking weather forecasts. They had thrilled to witness a partial eclipse in 2017 and were excited for totality. 
“It’s been on the calendar for years,” said Tim Wurst, 62. “It was very dusky and dim the last eclipse, but this one should be just all-out dark.” 
Experts urge the use of protective solar glasses to prevent eye damage that would otherwise occur from starting directly at the sun. Only during the few minutes of totality can the sun can be safely viewed without such eyewear, they said.
Overcast skies are among an eclipse-chaser’s worst fears. The US National Weather Services forecast as of Monday morning was for “a rapid untimely increase of clouds” in Southern Texas; less worrying “high thin clouds” for a swathe from Arkansas to the Midwest; and the clearest skies in northern New England.

17,"Germany, Nicaragua trade barbs at Gaza genocide case",Managua seeks to halt arms exports to Israel at World Court.,"THE HAGUE: Nicaragua and Germany crossed swords at the UN’s top court on Monday, with Managua saying Berlin was  “pathetic” to supply aid to Gazans while also providing Israel with weapons, a case the top German lawyer dismissed as  “grossly biased”.
Nicaragua has hauled Germany before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to demand judges impose emergency measures to stop Berlin from providing Israel with weapons and other assistance.
Lawyers for Nicaragua argued Germany is in breach of the 1948 United Nations Genocide Convention, set up in the wake of the Holocaust, by furnishing Israel with weapons.
“It is indeed a pathetic excuse to the Palestinian children, women and men to provide humanitarian aid, including through airdrops, on the one hand and to furnish the military equipment that is used to kill and annihilate them... on the other hand,” Daniel Mueller, a lawyer for Nicaragua, told the court.
Nicaragua’s ambassador to the Netherlands, Carlos Jose Arguello Gomez, told the court:  “Germany seems not to be able to differentiate between self-defence and genocide.” Nicaragua asked the ICJ to decide  “provisional measures” — emergency orders imposed while the court considers the broader case.

Managua seeks to halt arms exports to Israel at World Court

“Germany was and is fully conscious of the risk that the arms it has furnished and continues to furnish to Israel” could be used to commit a genocide, said Alain Pellet, a lawyer for Nicaragua. “It is extremely urgent that Germany finally suspend” such aid, he added.
Germany will respond fully in court on Tuesday but has already hit back at the allegations. Its top lawyer, Tania von Uslar-Gleichen, said Nicaragua’s case was  “grossly biased”.
“Germany completely rejects the accusations. We never did violate the Genocide Convention nor international humanitarian law either directly nor indirectly,” she told reporters.
“On the contrary, Germany is committed to the upholding of international law and this is what we work for internationally.” 
‘Unjustified decision’
The ICJ was set up to rule in disputes between nations and has become a key player in the crisis erupted after the October 7 raid.
In a separate case, South Africa has accused Israel of perpetrating genocide in the Gaza Strip, charges Israel vehemently denies.
In that case, the court ordered Israel to do everything in its power to prevent genocidal acts and recently toughened its stance, ordering additional measures obliging Israel to step up access to humanitarian aid.
The court’s rulings are binding but it lacks an enforcement mechanism. For example it has ordered Russia to stop its invasion of Ukraine, to no avail.
Nicaragua has requested five provisional measures, including that Germany  “immediately suspend its aid to Israel, in particular its military assistance including military equipment”.
It also calls on the court to order Germany to  “reverse its decision to suspend the funding of UNRWA”.
Germany said in January it was halting funding pending an investigation into Israeli accusations that several staff at the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees took part in the October 7 raid.
“This unjustified decision contributes to the suffering in Gaza where children women and men are starving,” Mueller told the court.
Nicaragua said in its submission that  “it could be comprehensible” that Germany would support an  “appropriate reaction” by ally Israel to the October 7 Hamas raid.
“But this cannot be an excuse for acting in violation of international law,” it said.
Mueller explained that Nicaragua was going after Germany instead of Israel’s main ally, the United States, because Washington does not recognise the court’s jurisdiction.
On Friday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Israel had  “no more excuse” to delay aid getting into Gaza. The United Nations has warned of  “catastrophic” hunger in the densely populated, besieged Palestinian territory.

18,UN Security Council begins review of Palestinian bid for full UN membership,"The council’s move was described as “historic” by the Palestinians, but angrily denounced by Israel.","UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations Security Council said on Monday that it would decide this month on the Palestinians’ bid for full UN membership, with the longshot campaign unlikely to survive US opposition.
As the Gaza war rages on into its seventh month, the council’s move was described as  “historic” by the Palestinians, but angrily denounced by Israel.
Maltese Ambassador Vanessa Frazier, who holds the rotating presidency of the council, said that  “the council has decided that this deliberation has to take place during the month of April.” Any request to become a UN member state must first pass a vote by the Security Council — where Israel’s ally the United States wields a veto — and then be endorsed by the General Assembly.
The Palestinians, who have had observer status at the world body since 2012, have lobbied for years to gain full membership, which would amount to recognition of Palestinian statehood.
“Today is a historic moment,” Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour told reporters on Monday as the Security Council started the review process after the Palestinians last week relaunched its formal 2011 bid.
“All we ask for is to take our rightful place among the community of nations, to be treated as equals, equals to other nations and states to live in freedom and dignity in peace and security in our ancestral land,” Mansour said in the General Assembly.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has for decades resisted creation of a Palestinian state and leads a far-right government with members hostile to the Palestinian Authority, which holds limited autonomy in sections of the West Bank.
And under US legislation, the United States is required to cut off funding to UN agencies that give full membership to a Palestinian state.
The Palestinians’ campaign faces decisive US opposition in the UN Security Council. Washington previously opposed the effort when it was raised in 2011. “Our position hasn’t changed,” said Deputy US Ambassador Robert Wood.

19,UN officials call for Lebanon-Israel border de-escalation,BEIRUT: United Nations officials said on Monday that six months of violence on the Israel-Lebanon border  “must...,"BEIRUT: United Nations officials said on Monday that six months of violence on the Israel-Lebanon border  “must stop”, urging de-escalation  “while there is still space for diplomacy”.
Israeli forces and Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, have exchanged regular cross-border fire since the day after Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 raid on Israel that triggered crisis in the Gaza Strip.
Other armed groups in Lebanon including Palestinian militants have also occasionally claimed launches into Israel. “It is six months since the exchanges of fire across the Blue Line began, and continue unabated, taking a heavy toll on both sides,” said a joint statement from UN special coordinator for Lebanon, Joanna Wronecka, and Aroldo Lazaro, head of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon.
UNIFIL peacekeepers patrol the so-called Blue Line between Lebanon and Israel, demarcated by the UN in 2000 after Israeli troops pulled out of southern Lebanon.
“The violence and suffering has gone on too long. It must stop,” the officials said.
They urged all sides to  “avail of all avenues to avoid further escalation while there is still space for diplomacy”.
Hezbollah, which has a powerful arsenal of rockets and missiles and says it acts in support of Hamas, has upped its attacks though they are generally limited to the border area.

20,EU nears final vote on landmark asylum reform,1.14m people sought asylum in 27-nation bloc last year.,"BRUSSELS: The EU will vote on Wednesday on a vast overhaul of its immigration policies that would notably harden entry procedures for asylum-seekers and require all the bloc’s countries to share responsibility.
The European Parliament will decide a series of laws forming the bloc’s migration and asylum pact, based on a European Commission proposal first made in September 2020.
The overhaul was reached only after overcoming years of tensions and divisions among EU member countries. Once fully adopted, it would come into effect from 2026.
Alongside its passage, the European Union has been striking agreements with several outside countries to try to reduce the number of migrants leaving their territories with the goal of reaching Europe.

1.14m people sought asylum in 27-nation bloc last year

The backdrop of the two-pronged approach is a rise in asylum applications in the 27-nation EU, which last year reached 1.14 million, the highest level since 2016.
Irregular migrant entries into the bloc are also increasing, to 380,000 last year according to the EU’s border and coast guard agency Frontex.
The migration and asylum pact has been opposed, for very different reasons, by the far right, the far left and some socialist lawmakers.
“After years of impasse, the new migration rules allow us to regain control over our external borders and reduce pressure on the EU. State authorities, not smugglers, have to decide who enters the European Union,” said Manfred Weber, head of the biggest political group in the European Parliament, the centre-right European People’s Party.
NGOs and migrant charities have come out against the reform, especially its provision creating border facilities to accommodate asylum-seekers and quickly send back those deemed ineligible, which they fear will lead to systematic detentions.
The reform largely retains the basic rule in force under which the first EU country in which an asylum-seeker arrives is responsible for their case.
But it adds a “solidarity mechanism” that requires all EU countries to help front-line states such as Italy and Greece when they come under pressure by either taking in some of the asylum-seekers or providing an equivalent financial contribution.
Inflammatory topic 
A French centrist lawmaker in the European Parliament, Fabienne Keller, who shepherded one of the texts, called the pact “very balanced” and “a big improvement over the current situation”.
“There are better checks on flows of irregular migration through the border procedures and more solidarity,” she said.
But she acknowledged it was “a hugely inflammatory topic” and criticised far-right lawmakers for “trying to panic everybody” over the changes.
The parliament’s vote will not be the last step for the pact, as the technical application of its procedures still need to be defined, Keller said.
They include how to organise the border centres and supply them with sufficient resources, translators and police officers.
Another controversial point is a provision to send asylum-seekers to “safe” third countries.
A left-wing lawmaker, Raphael Glucksmann of France, said “that would allow asylum-seekers likely to obtain asylum in an EU country to be sent to transit countries”.
He criticised a compromise under which some EU nations would be able to offset their financial obligations under the solidarity mechanism if they helped pay for tougher border security in another EU country.
“That upholds the idea of a ‘safe third country’ which would apply to some countries that are ‘safe’ only by that label,” he said. “It’s another step towards the outsourcing of our borders.” On the far right, lawmaker Jean-Paul Garraud of France said “the outer borders of the EU are like sieves and nothing has been done to change that”.
One of the few changes the far right favoured was a system to take the biometric data of each arriving asylum-seeker and put it into an EU database called Eurodac, he said, though he argued it would do little to stop mass irregular immigration.
“These mechanisms are just smokescreens,” he said. “They will be ineffective and won’t be able to be applied given the scale of the migration flows.”
