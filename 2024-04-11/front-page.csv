• Former prime minister pledges to build bridges between treasury, opposition benches
• Ali Zafar, Azam Tarar disagree over definition of ‘duly constituted’ in Article 60 of Constitution
• Khawaja Asif says PTI ‘treading path of chaos’
ISLAMABAD: Amid raucous protest and walk-out by PTI members, PPP’s Senator Yousuf Raza Gillani and PML-N’s Senator Syedaal Khan Nasar were elected unopposed as the Senate chairman and deputy chairman, respectively, on Tuesday.
Mr Gillani, the joint candidate of the PML-N-led ruling coalition, now holds the distinction of being elected to three of the four top constitutional offices — the president, prime minister, National Assembly speaker and Senate chairman.
He served as the PM from March 25, 2008 to June 19, 2012 and as NA speaker from October 17, 1993 to February 16, 1997.
He is the second Senate chairman to have been elected unopposed, the first being Mian Raza Rabbani, also from PPP.
Shortly after announcing Mr Gillani’s victory, the presiding officer, Senator Ishaq Dar, took oath from the newly elected Senate chairman.
Mr Gillani then took his seat at the helm, announced his deputy’s victory, and administered the oath.
Senator Khan, the deputy chairman, was elected to the house from Balochistan on PML-N’s ticket and was nominated by his party colleague Azam Nazeer Tarar and PPP’s Sherry Rehman.
Slogans and protests
The announcement of Mr Gillani’s victory was followed by loud slogans of “long live Bhutto” raised by PPP activists sitting in visitors’ galleries.
However, their chants failed to drown the noise of PTI senators who protested over the elections of Senate chairman and deputy chairman in an “incomplete house”.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s 11 seats in Senate are vacant as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had postponed the election due to a controversy over the delay in administration of oath to KP assembly members elected on reserved seats.
PTI senators gathered in front of the chairman’s dais and raised the slogans of “mandate thieves” and “who will save Pakistan: Imran Khan, Imran Khan”.
Later, PTI staged a walk-out from the house.
Earlier in the day, 41 out of the 43 newly elected senators took oaths and signed the roll after their names were called one by one by the Senate secretary.
JUI-F’s Senator-elect Maulana Abdul Wasay and independent Senator-elect Faisal Vawda could not take oath as they were absent from the sitting.
‘Here to build bridges’
In remarks after taking the oath, Mr Gillani recalled the hanging of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
A visibly emotional Mr Gillani noted that the Supreme Court recently “acknowledged the judicial murder and admitted this historical injustice”.
“Currently, the crisis is deep. Pakistan faces an assault from those who seek to divide and polarise us. Those who seek to incite hatred. Those who seek to replace norms of civility with abuse and demagoguery,” he said.
“PPP has always rejected the politics of hate and preferred politics of reconciliation and of the welfare of the people.”
“I will be the chairman of the entire House, and my ambition is to build bridges, enable dialogue, and provide a space which allows for meaningful, robust discussion and disagreements within parliamentary norms and conventions and, most importantly, for the progress of the country,” the Senate chairman asserted.
PTI stages walk-out
At the outset of the sitting, PTI said that the election of Senate chairman and deputy chairman was unconstitutional because the 96-member house was incomplete since elections weren’t held on 11 seats from KP.
The party demanded the election be postponed till the house was completed and Senate elections were held in KP.
While speaking on a point of order, PTI’s parliamentary leader, Senator Ali Zafar, referred to Articles 59 and 60 of the Constitution and said the election of Senate chairman and deputy chairman couldn’t be held unless the house has been “duly constituted and all senators elected from four provinces don’t take oath”.
The election to the two positions without complete representation of a province would be tantamount to damaging the federation, said Mr Zafar.
When his pleas were ignored, Mr Zafar said, “PTI would not become part of this unconstitutional process”.
Another PTI Senator, Mohsin Aziz, also followed suit and said that the elections would “leave a scar on the people of KP” and urged the chair to adjourn the session.
He termed the electoral exercise in the absence of 11 senators as unconstitutional and advised the ruling coalition “to choose between the interest of the state and politics”.
Interpretation of ‘duly constituted’
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar rejected PTI’s assertions and read out Article 60 of the Constitution, which stated: “After the Senate has been duly constituted, it shall, at its first meeting and to the exclusion of any other business, elect from amongst its members a Chairman and a Deputy Chairman and, so often as the Office of Chairman or Deputy Chairman becomes vacant, the Senate shall elect another member as Chairman or, as the case may be, Deputy Chairman.”
He reasoned that the Senate came into existence after the Constitution of 1973 was framed.
He claimed that the word “duly constituted” in the first part of Article 60 was used for the first Senate election and in the context of “building the house” since it was a new body.
According to Mr Tarar, the second part of the article makes no mention of the word “duly constituted” and thus, this condition did not apply at the moment.
The minister also referred to Article 53 of the Constitution, which outlines the procedure for the election of National Assembly speaker and deputy speaker.
“The word duly constituted is not used here since the National Assembly already existed when the Constitution was framed.”
The law minister then blamed PTI’s government in KP for the postponement of Senate elections in the province.
The elections were not postponed due to some natural disaster like flood but the ECP “was forced” to do so because the KP Assembly speaker did not administer oaths to the members elected on reserved seats despite a court order, the law minister added.
Mr Tarar also cited Article 67, which stated that proceedings “shall not be invalid on the ground that some persons who were not entitled to do so sat, voted or otherwise took part in the proceedings”.
“The house is complete for constitutional purposes,” he said and requested the presiding officer to proceed further.
After the law minister’s speech, the presiding officer overruled the PTI objections and continued with the election process.
‘PTI treading on path of chaos’
Later, while talking to the media outside the Parliament House, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif accused PTI of “treading on the path of chaos” and inciting the politics of denial, violence and hatred, according to APP.
He criticised the party for boycotting the election process and said dialogue and reconciliation should take place between political parties to resolve issues instead of contestation.
“PTI wanted to take the path of confrontation and we will not be an accomplice in chaos and violence,” the minister said.

• Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Indonesia among several countries observing Eidul Fitr today
• Shawwal moon not sighted in India and Bangladesh, which will mark festival tomorrow
ISLAMABAD: The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee on Tuesday announced that the whole nation will unanimously celebrate Eidul Fitr today (Wednesday) following the receipt of moon-sighting testimonies from various parts of the country.
The decision came despite initial reports of no Shawwal moon sightings by several zonal committees. The committees in Karachi and Lahore announced at around 7:30pm on Tuesday that there was no evidence of moon sightings in their regions.
With the announcement, Pakistan has joined several countries across the world in celebrating Eidul Fitr on Wednesday.
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Turkiye, Indonesia and Australia are some of the countries that are celebrating Eid today. However, the moon was not sighted in India and Bangladesh, which will observe the festival on Thursday.
The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee convened at the Federal Secretariat’s Kohsar Block in Islamabad, with Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad presiding over the meeting.
The gathering saw participation from committee members, primarily clerics representing major Islamic schools of thought — Shia, Barelvi, Deobandi and Ahle Hadis — alongside officials and technical experts from the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Suparco, and the Ministry of Science and Technology.
Maulana Azad, addressing the media after the meeting, shared that credible evidence of the moon being sighted in major parts of the country, including the erstwhile Fata and the Gilgit-Baltistan, led to the collective decision to mark Eidul Fitr the following day.
“Eidul Fitr will be celebrated tomorrow,” he announced and prayed for the welfare of the country and the whole ummah.
He said the Shawwal moon was sighted in Karachi, Dir, Mohmand Agency, Faisalabad, Skardu and other areas. “We all congratulate the nation on this occasion,” he said, adding that this was also message of unity to the Islamic world due to Eid falling on the same day in most Muslim nations.
Maulana Azad stressed the need for all sections of society to move forward together for the sake of the country and paid tribute to the sacrifices rendered by armed forces to ensure peace in the country.
Zonal committees
Earlier, Maulana Muhammad Ahmed Salfi, head of the zonal Ruet-i-Hilal committee in Karachi, announced at around 7:30pm that there was no evidence of moon sighting in the city.
He said the Met Office had briefed the committee that a new moon was easily visible if its age was around 23 hours, whereas the moon on Tuesday had the age of 20 hours and it was difficult to view. “We have conveyed our findings to the central committee in Islamabad,” Maulana Salfi said.
However, he was confronted by the media persons who claimed that they themselves had seen the crescent through the official telescope installed at the roof of the Met Office building in Karachi. “I cannot speak on behalf of the media or anybody else,” Maulana Salfi responded.
A similar situation was faced by the zonal committee in Lahore, which also announced at around 7:30pm moon was not sighted.
However, the head of the zonal Ruet-i-Hilal committee in Peshawar, Prof Abdul Ghafoor, announced that 64 testimonies had been received and the information was forwarded to the central committee in Islamabad after verification in accordance with the prescribed criteria.
Meanwhile, the Dawoodi Bohra community celebrated Eidul Fitr across the country on Tuesday, as per the Fatimid calendar.

According to Downdet­e­c­tor, which tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources, users reported issues with the services of three internet service providers — Pakis­tan Teleco­m­munica­tion Com­­pany Ltd (PTCL), Tra­nsworld Home, and Nayatel — shortly after noon.
Around 4pm, the internet tracker showed that user reports indicated no current problems with the latter two and possible problems with PTCL.
Internet monitor Netbl­ocks also reported the disruption followed by the recovery. It said operators had attributed the disturbance to a “technical issue”.
For PTCL, users had reported a disruption in services primarily from Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi. For Trans­world Home, issues were earlier reported from Lahore, Karachi, Rawal­pindi and Peshawar.
For Nayatel, users had reported issues from Rawalpindi, Lahore and near Okara.
In an email to customers, seen by Dawn.com, Transworld Home said that there was an “unexpected nationwide outage affecting internet services in Pakistan”.
Today’s disruption came as access to social media platform X has been large­­ly disrupted in the country since February 17, after former commissioner Rawal­­­pindi Liaquat Ali Chatta made a statement in front of the media claiming that the “elections were rigged”.

3,"Amid schools’ expansion, govt to declare education emergency",PM Shehbaz vows to provide free education to children of poor and deserving families by establishing Daanish schools.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday announced that the federal government would declare an education emergency in the country and would provide all possible reso­urces to educate children of poor families.
He vowed to replicate his idea of free education to children of poor and deserving families by establishing Daanish Schools in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and remote areas of Balochistan and Sindh to fulfill the aspiration of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.
“This is not the fault of the poor children if their parents cannot afford to provide top quality education to their children despite working hard…If iron gates of the Aitchison College or Grammar School are obstructing their way (to top quality education), the door of Daanish Schools are open for them,” the prime minister said.
He expressed these views while speaking at a ceremony, organised for the inspection of a site for the Daanish School being established in the Kuri area of the federal capital.

Malala urges PM Shehbaz to increase budget for education to 4pc of GDP

To be established over 30 acres of land, the sch­ool will provide free education and accommodat­ion to the children of people of low-income groups from the capital city and its suburbs. The school will be built in Kurri area at an estimated cost of over Rs5 billion.
Calling the alarming figure of 26 million out-of-school children a “cri­minal negligence”, the prime minister said that Quaid-i-Azam’s dream about Pakistan would remain unfulfilled without making arrangements and ensuring top quality education for the children of the poor people of the country.
“There can be no bigger national service or the fulfillment of the responsibility than enrolling these out-of-school children into schools,” Mr Shehbaz said, adding that the federal government would bear all expenses of constructing Daanish Schools in AJK, the GB and remote areas of Balochistan and Sindh.
The prime minister told the gathering of federal ministers, bureaucrats, heads of international institutions, educationists and students that Daanish School project was initiated under PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s vision.
Recounting the journey of the project, the prime minister said the PML-N had to face a lot of criticism for launching this initiative to support the children of the people belonging to low-income groups, but it remained steadfast in its commitment to ensure top-quality education for the children of the people of low-income group.
He also recalled that under Nawaz Sharif’s leadership, the PML-N government gave away laptops to students in the past which became an earning tool for them. Besides, he said, the then Punjab government also recruited around 200,000 teachers purely on merit.
He said the groundbreaking of Islamabad’s Daanish School would be performed soon and asked the education ministry to ensure the project’s completion within six to eight months. He also announced that he would personally inaugurate Daanish schools to be established in AJK, GB, Balochistan and Sindh.
Malala for bigger budget allocation
Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and education activist Malala Yousafzai on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to increase expenditure on education up to four per cent of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
In a letter written to the premier, Ms Malala said Pakistan was spending less than 2 per cent of its GDP on education and she wanted it to reach and surpass 4pc of the GDP.
“Our work with the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training has allowed us to reach more than 4,500 high schools, engaging directly with nearly 500,000 girls through our STEAM partnership. We also support civil society and education experts in their efforts to improve teaching practices, digital education, and girls’ leadership development,” she said.
The Malala Foundation had given Pakistan $15 million for the promotion of education in Pakistan, Ms Yousafzai wrote, requesting the new government to focus more on girls’ education. “
As you develop your first 100-day plan, I look forward to working with your government to elevate girls’ education as a priority. I assure you that my team in Pakistan and our grantees are working diligently with your federal and provincial governments, as well as other development partners, to advance our shared goals as rapidly and effectively as possible,“ she wrote.

4,Syedaal Khan Nasar — from student leader to upper house,Political observers believe elevation of a Balochistan-based senator to deputy chairman’s post is a “major shift” in the politics of PML-N.,"QUETTA: PML-N Sena­tor Syedaal Khan Nasar comes from a rich political and tribal background, but in contrast with his father Rehman Khan Nasar — a diehard supporter of Pashtun anti-colonial leader Bacha Khan who spent 15 years in exile in Afghanistan — he chose to pursue his political career on the platform a right-wing party i.e. the PML-N.
Senator Nasar born on April 17, 1975, and started his political journey by joi­ning the Pashtun Stud­ent Federation (PSF), but soon he found himself aloof from the left-wing politics and joined the Muslim Stu­dent Federation — a student wing of the PML-N.
After obtaining an FSc degree from the government science college in Quetta, the senator enrolled in the Balochistan University as a private candidate. As student leader, he remained the central secretary general of the MSF from 1996 to 1999 and later became the president of the Muslim Youth Wing from 1999 to 2002.
The PML-N central leadership inducted him into the parent party and appointed him as the provincial additional general secretary of the PML-N Balochistan and also made him a member of the central working committee of the party.
Syedaal Khan Nasar was amongst those PML-N leaders who remained loyal — despite repercussions — to Nawaz Sharif during the Musharraf regime when the PML-N chief had gone into exile in Saudi Arabia and his party crumbled in his absence. Senator Nasar refused the offers to join the PML-Q, which was brought into power by General Musharraf.
He served the party as the senior vice president of PML-N Balochistan from 2013 to 2018 and also as provincial general secretary from 2018 to 2020. He also served as a political adviser to former Balochistan CM Nawab Sanaullah Zehri in the PML-N coalition government in Balochistan.
In the 2018 elections, the PML-N became almost dormant after the departure of key leaders but Syedaal Nasar was among those who remained loyal to the party.
After Nawaz Sharif returned from London, a large number of electables who had left the party came back during the visit of the PML-N supreme leader to Quetta.
These leaders were later awarded party tickets for the national and provincial assembly seats in Balochistan. When Syedaal Khan Nasar did not get the ticket, everyone was astonished.
Subsequently, the applications for the Senate election were invited and many former senators and tycoons, including Mr Nasar, applied for the ticket. However, Senator Nasar got the ticket and after the initial rejection of nomination papers, the PML-N leader made it to the upper house after an election tribunal allowed him to contest the election.
Political observers believe the elevation of a Balochistan-based senator to the deputy chairman’s post is a “major shift” in the politics of the PML-N. The party picked Senator Nasar despite the presence of tycoons and other bigwigs.
“I am very thankful to the party’s supreme leader Main Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who considered me for the slot of Deputy Chairman Senate,” Syedaal Khan told Dawn, adding that Pervaiz Rashid, Saad Rafique, and Azam Nazeer Tarar were also his supporters.

5,Situationer: How ‘difficult cases’ can shape CJP Isa’s legacy,"Although top judge has many detractors, his penchant for picking up threads of ‘unfinished judicial business’ has won him many admirers.","SEVEN months into his term, the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa has already started to shake things up in an attempt to shake the ghosts of the past, when the judiciary appeared reluctant to carry out accountability or introspection.
Not only did he bring back full court meetings, but the chief judge also agreed to dilute his powers as the CJP under the Practice and Procedure Act 2023, which was suspended by his predecessor Umar Ata Bandial, who termed the law “interference in court affairs”.
 
 

In the words of senior lawyer Akram Sheikh, an era of transparency and openness was ushered in when CJP Isa took oath of office in Sept last year.
“Qazi sahib has pioneered a new era in our superior judiciary and can be rightly termed as having brought revolutionary changes in [the] running of the highest court,” he said, adding that CJP Isa took oath on Sunday, and the first thing he did was to convene a meeting of the full court.

Although the top judge has many detractors, his penchant for picking up threads of ‘unfinished judicial business’, such as the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto case, has won him many unlikely admirers

On the same day, he decided to take up a case about the Practice and Procedure Act, filed months before he took charge.
The chief judge also formed a committee of three senior judges for the constitution of benches under Article 184(3), a power earlier held by the ‘master of roster’, i.e. the chief justice.
Mr Sheikh hoped that CJP Isa would be able to turn the court into an “actually final but satisfactory resort for consumers of justice”.
Former additional attorney general (AAG) Tariq Mehmood Khokhar agreed. He said CJP Isa inherited an institution with deepening fissures and lacking the power to effect elections under the Constitution, but he proved to be instrumental in plugging institutional fissures and holding general elections.
Adherence to Constitution
At the very outset, Justice Isa seemed to make it clear that the court would concern itself with the obligations enshrined in the Con­stitution and all judgements would emanate from that document.
This meant that the court would not overstep its bounds, as seen in the past, nor let anyone else do so.
To back up this commitment, the CJP took up two cases: the general elections case and the Musharraf case.
While he remained steadfast in his desire not to let the government delay elections any further than they already had been, a landmark verdict on Jan 10, 2024 upheld the death penalty awarded to late military ruler Gen Pervez Musharraf.
 
 

In another daring move before taking office, Justice Isa attended a session of the National Assembly on the golden jubilee of the Constitution. He later shrugged off clamour on social media by saying that the occasion was one of celebration for all citizens, and not the exclusive domain of any particular political party or institution.
ZAB reference
Another achievement of the Isa-led court is the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto reference, which took over a decade to decide. During a visit to a court reporters’ event last year when he was still the senior puisne judge, a journalist had quipped that “whenever we talk of the rule of law, we are faced with a paradox that the one who framed the 1973 Constitution, still awaits justice”.
The journalist was referring to the hanging of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on April 4, 1979, as the presidential reference seeking an opinion on revisiting the death sentence in the case was still pending while the country was celebrating the golden jubilee of the 1973 Constitution.
Soon after assuming the top office, CJP Isa not only fixed the reference for hearing, but had also decided the same on March 6, by admitting that fair trial and due process to Bhutto was denied by the Lahore High Court (LHC) and then appellate court’s final endorsement.
 
 

The reference was filed in April 2011 and heard last time in Jan 2012 by then Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. After that, it was not taken up by successive CJPs for 12 years.
“You need a considerable moral courage to accept the grave injustice done to the then Prime Minister by none other than the top judiciary itself,” commented a senior counsel on condition of anonymity.
The other achievements of the top judge include live streaming of court proceedings, reversal of lifetime disqualification for elected representatives, accountability of a brother judge (Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi), and relief to ex-IHC judge Shaukat Siddiqui, who was sacked for claiming the involvement of the ISI in the court affairs.
 
 

This last decision also proved to be a catalyst for others to come forward with their gripes, as six judges of the Islamabad High Court — finding solace in the top court’s exoneration of their former colleague — found the courage to raise some uncomfortable issues before the Supreme Judicial Council.
Faults
But the top judge is not without his detractors. The PTI election symbol case, choosing returning officers (ROs) from the executive, loss of reserved seats for PTI, JIT notices to journalists and interim orders in the military courts have enraged many, said Mr Khokhar, the former additional attorney general.
He added that the timing was not propitious for the CJP, and a social media campaign against him only added to it.
Mr Sheikh, the seasoned lawyer, said the CJP did earn a “negative perception” for deciding political cases, but overall “he can rightly claim to his credit the drastic changes he introduced” as the top judge. The lawyer said that through a live telecast of trials, he turned the closed-door Supreme Court into an open, transparent, and dynamic institution.
After becoming the CJP, Justice Isa also appointed the SC’s first-ever woman registrar, Jazeela Aslam, who was a district and sessions judge in Okara. His decision to invite his spouse Sarina Isa to stand next to him during the oath-taking ceremony also speaks for his progressive credentials.
Perceived as an upright judge, the top adjudicator is certainly not without his faults. He is also routinely subjected to intense criticism for his straightforward, and often condescending approach and penchant for observations. But even his detractors accept openly that one “needs extreme courage to build such a legacy”.

MAKKAH: PM Shehbaz Sharif pays his respects at the Holy Ka’aba as he performs Umrah.—PPI

 
• Saudi, Pakistani premiers also discuss Gaza and Kashmir
• Tranche is part of $25bn pledged under SIFC
• Joint communique makes no mention of the area of investment
• Shehbaz wraps up his three-day tour to Kingdom 
ISLAMABAD: Saudi Arabia has committed to fast-tracking the initial tra­nche of $5 billion investment in Pakistan, while Islamabad has promised to facilitate the expedited process aimed at enhancing economic cooperation between the two countries.
This agreement was reached at a meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif in Makkah on Sunday night.
PM Sharif was on a three-day visit to pursue economic support from the kingdom.
According to a joint communique issued simultaneously from Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of the meeting, the two leaders discussed ways for strengthening bilateral ties with special focus on “Kingdom’s supportive role in Pakistan’s economy and the mutual desire to strengthen trade and investment ties”.
“Both parties affirmed their commitment to expediting the first wave of investment package worth $5 billion, which was discussed previously,” the statement added.
It, however, did not mention the sector in which this investment would be made.
Last year Saudi Arabia had promised to invest $25 billion within next five years under the Spe­cial Investment Facilita­tion Council (SIFC) that is seeking investments in the energy, IT, minerals, defence, and agriculture sectors from the Arab countries.
It is expected that the $5bn investment would be made in the minerals sector especially the Reko Diq gold and copper mines as Saudi Arabia has already been studying the prospects of tapping into this sector, though the kingdom also has interest in petroleum, agriculture as well as IT sectors.
Barrick Gold Corp, which holds 50pc shares in Reko Diq mine had in August 2023 indicated that there was a possibility of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund entering the venture through Pakistan’s 25pc equity in the project.

Mr Sharif assured Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Pakistan’s commitment to enhancing economic cooperation with the Saudi kingdom.
The two leaders also discussed the tense ties between India and Pakistan.
“The two sides stressed the importance of dialogue between Pakis­tan and India to resolve the outstanding issues bet­ween the two countries, especially the Jam­mu and Kashmir dispute to ensure peace and stability in the region,” the communique read.
Riyadh has been encou­raging Pakistan to explore avenues for normalisation with India. The Arab leaders, after the elections in India, may play a pivotal role in facilitating engagement bet­ween India and Pakistan, urging both to step back from conflict and military standoffs.
Saudi Arabia’s encouragement of peace between India and Pakistan aligns with its strategic, economic, and geopolitical in­­t­erests, aiming to enha­n­ce regional stability and sec­u­­­re a conducive environment for its Vision 2030 in­­­vestments in South Asia.
This effort also supports its counterterrorism objectives.
Discussing the Pales­t­ine issue, both Pakistan and Saudi premiers urged inte­rnational efforts to halt Israeli military operations in Gaza and mitigate hum­a­nitarian impact. They also called on Israel to cease hostilities, adhere to int­ernational law, and faci­litate unhindered hum­a­nitarian aid access to Gaza.
The two leaders highlighted the need for advancing the peace process in accordance with relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and the General Assem­bly as well as the Arab Peace Initiative, aimed at finding a just and comprehensive solution, for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.

8,"20 convicts in May 9 cases released from jail, govt tells SC",Most of them served around 10 months in jail as the remaining period of their punishment was remitted by COAS.,"ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Monday informed the Supreme Court that 20 persons who were arrested and jailed for their involvement in the May 9 violence have been released so that they could celebrate Eidul Fitr with their family, after they served major part of their sentence while the remaining period of their punishment was remitted by Chief of the Army Staff (COAS).
Among them, four belong to Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa while all other 16 hail from Punjab. They were released in the province of KP and Punjab on April 7 and 6, respectively.
The office of the Atto­rney General for Pakis­tan (AGP) furnished a list of 20 individuals before the Supreme Court to be made part of the record.
Earlier on March 28, a six-judge SC bench headed by Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan had modified its Dec 13, 2023 order that suspended the operation of its Oct 23 decision which nullified the military trial of civilians involved in the May 9 violence.
 
 

Accor­ding to the amended order, a direction was issued that military courts can commence trials but they will not convict or acquit any suspect until the pendency of government-instituted Intra-Court Appeals (ICAs).

Most of them served around 10 months in jail as the remaining period of their punishment was remitted by COAS

AGP Mansoor Usman Awan had told the SC that as per instructions 20 persons could be released before the coming Eid.
The report furnished before the SC stated that in pursuance to its March 28 directions, the military courts were allowed to resume trial and therefore sentences in cases of lesser punishments were handed down.

9,Signs point to rare ‘same-day’ Eid,Central moon-sighting body to meet at roof of Federal Secreta­riat’s Kohsar Block in Islamabad.,"ISLAMABAD: As multiple countries across the world decided to celebrate Eidul Fitr on Wednesday (tomorrow) after the crescent was not sighted on Monday, the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee will meet in Islamabad today to spot the Shawwal crescent, giving rise to the possibility of a same-day Eid across the Muslim world.
In addition to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Kuwait will celebrate Eid tomorrow, according to media reports in the Gulf-based newspapers. Simi­larly, Australia has also announced that Eid will be observed on Wednesday.
On the other hand, the central moon-sighting body will meet at the roof of the Federal Secreta­riat’s Kohsar Block in Islamabad, while meetings of zonal and district Ruet-i-Hilal committees will be held at their respective headquarters concurrently. If the committee manages to spot the new moon today, then Pakistan will also celebrate Eid with the rest of the world.
Ruet-i-Hilal Committee
In a statement on Mon­day, the committee requ­es­ted citizens to share any information regarding sightings of the moon with the committees in their respective areas.
The meeting will be chaired by Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad, and atten-ded by the members of the Ruet-i-Hilal Commit­tee, as well as officials from the Meteorological Department, Suparco, and the Ministry of Science and Technology.
Talking to Dawn, Maulana Azad said that extensive meetings and discussions have been held with clerics and religious groups across the country, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
All groups who had apprehensions with the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee in the past have been taken on board and it is unlikely that any cleric would form their private moon sighting committee, he said.
In the past, different parts of the country have observed Eid on different dates owing to differences in moon-sighting evidence and non-adherence to the Central Ruet-i-Hilal committee’s diktat.
Most notably, Peshawar’s Mufti Shahabudin Popalzai would often announce Eid in KP a day ahead of the rest of the country. In 2022, the country saw Eid being celebrated on three different dates in North Waziristan, Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa, and the rest of the country.
A similar situation occurred in 2012, when the residents of the then-tribal areas celebrated Eid on Aug 18, KP announced Eid on Aug 19 and the rest of the country celebrated on Aug 20.
Muslim world
According to the UAE-based newspaper The National, a group of astronomers, court officials and advisers from the Emirates’ Islamic authority — gathered to observe the crescent heralding the start of Shawwal, the 10th month of the Islamic calendar.
“As the moon could not be sighted, Tuesday will be the 30th and final day of Ramazan this year,” it reported.
The Arab News, while quoting the Saudi Supreme Court, said that the Shawwal crescent was not sighted on Monday evening. Tuesday will be the final day of the holy month, it reported.
The Gulf Times reported that the Crescent Sighting Committee at the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs in Qatar announced that April 9 will be the last day of the blessed month of Ramazan and that Wednesday, April 10, will be the first day of Eid.
According to Gulf News, “Aus­tralia has officially announced Wednesday as the first day of Eid Al Fitr, marking the end of Ramazan and the beginning of the month of Shawwal.”

10,Complaint against IHC judge Mohsin Akhtar Kay­ani lands before Supreme Judicial Council,Justice Kayani was among six judges who wrote letter on ‘meddling’ allegations.,"ISLAMABAD: A former official of the Islam­abad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) has moved the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) aga­inst senior puisne judge Mohsin Akhtar Kay­ani — who is among the six judges who recently wrote a letter to the SJC detailing alleged harassment at the hands of state institutions.
IHCBA former general secretary Mohammad Waqas alleged that IHC Justice Kayani “waged a war against the forces of Pakistan in a planned manner by inducing and convincing other judges of high court”.
The complaint said that “the action of the learned judge… is not initiated in good faith as he is facing ‘references’ questioning his integrity and conduct as a judge”.
An earlier reference revolved around the lawyers of the chamber where Justice Kayani was practising law before his appointment to the IHC.

Justice Kayani was among six judges who wrote letter on ‘meddling’ allegations

The complaint highlighted a quarrel between the special prosecutor of the Benazir murder case, Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali, and the associates of the law chamber in question. A case in this regard was registered at the Margalla police station.
The complaint claimed that intelligence agencies were required to keep a check on the ‘criminal intents’ of judges, but they had failed to do so.
It claimed that the letter attempted to provoke the sentiments of the people affiliated with a political party and, in fact has mali­gned the prestigious office of a judge by indulging in political affairs for his personal gains. It requested proceedings aga­i­nst the judge under Article 209.
Last month, six IHC judges accused the country’s intelligence apparatus of interference in judicial affairs, including attempts to pressure judges through abduction and torture of their relatives and secret surveillance inside their homes.
The letter, addressed to Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Supreme Court judges Mansoor Ali Shah and Munib Akhtar and chief justices of the IHC and Peshawar High Court, also questioned if there “exists a state police to intimidate and coerce judges”.
In addition to Justice Kayani, the letter dated March 25 was also signed by Justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir, and Saman Rafat Imtiaz of the IHC.

11,Rs4.92 per unit extra for electricity used in Feb,"Move to impact consumers of all ex-Wapda Discos, generating net financial impact of about Rs45bn.","ISLAMABAD: Consu­mers will pay Rs4.92 per unit extra next month for electricity consumed in February, after the power regulator approved the hike as additional fuel cost adjustment (FCA).
The National Electric Power Regulatory Autho­rity (Nepra) notified the increase on Monday. It will impact consumers of all ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos), generating a net financial impact of about Rs45bn.
The net tariff increase because of the FCA impact would be about Rs7.51 per unit owing to its partial spillover to the upcoming quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA), as explained by the regulator during a public hearing on March 28.
The adjustment will be applicable to “all the consumer categories except Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and lifeline consumers”, said the Nepra’s notification.
Earlier, the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), on behalf of Discos, had sought an additional FCA of Rs4.99 per unit for the electricity consumed in February.
It claimed that the reference fuel cost for January was set at Rs4.43 per unit, but the actual fuel cost more than doubled to Rs9.42 per unit.
The additional FCA is about 113pc higher than the pre-fixed fuel cost of Rs4.43 per unit already charged to consumers in February.
After minor deductions, the regulator worked out the total per unit fuel cost at Rs9.35 and allowed Rs4.92 per unit additional FCA — 7 paise per unit lower than the Discos’ demand.
Poor fuel price calculations
It also calls into question the capabilities of the power sector bureaucracy to forecast fuel costs even for six to seven months.
The additional FCAs have remained over 80pc higher in recent months than pre-determined fuel costs notified at the start of the fiscal year.
This increase in FCA is on top of about 26pc inc­rease in annual base tariff and another 16pc hike under quarterly tariff adj­u­stment already in place.
As a result, consumers would continue to pay excessive bills despite lower consumption. This was despite the fact that more than 77pc share of electricity came from local resources.
The higher FCA for Feb 2024 was mainly because of the adverse fuel mix than estimated and higher domestic coal and gas prices, although imported fuel prices, including furnace oil and LNG, were lower in February, and the exchange rate remained stable.
The actual supply from cheaper hydropower and domestic coal was about 2pc and 5pc lower than reference estimates, respectively, while imported coal’s share was also about 6pc lower.
On the other hand, the share of RLNG-based supply went beyond 20pc of the national grid, although it was estimated to be zero.
The nuclear supply to the grid was also lower than the reference estimate.
‘Concerns’ at low demand
Besides, the regulator expressed serious concerns over the constantly declining electricity demand.
Till February 2024, the overall demand had reduced by around 12pc compared to reference projections.
“This decrease in sales would consequently result in higher quarterly adjustments, leading to further increase in tariff”, the regulator noted and directed the CPPA and Ministry of Energy to analyse the impact of ending commercial-based load-shedding and submit a proposal to improve the demand.
It was also highlighted that currently, capacity charges constitute over 60pc of the tariff, much higher than international standards.
The regulator also asked the CPPA and the government “to evaluate the possibilities of reducing capacity charges while remaining within the legal framework”.
The Nepra also expressed displeasure that supply from wind-based power plants was being curtailed, leading to the functioning of power plants running on expensive imported fuel.
It was also observed that the Guddu Thermal Power Station was being operated on a 45pc plant factor on open cycle instead of combined cycle.
Had this plant been running on combined cycle, it would have reduced the cost of generation since it was a more efficient process.
The power regulator also noted the National Transmission and Despatch Company’s version that the constraint in the North-South corridor was due to national generation coming at the low of 7,000 to 8,000 MW, even though the system had a 27,000MW evacuation capacity.
Ironically, $655 million were spent on developing the corridor’s extension which would not be required beyond 2030 due to new hydel power plants coming in the northern region.

12,Upper House meets today to pick its custodians,Gilani looks set to become Senate chairman; PML-N staying mum on its candidate for deputy chairman.,"• Gilani looks set to become Senate chairman; PML-N staying mum on its candidate for deputy chairman
• 43 senators-elect to take oath; PTI boycotts ‘unconstitutional’ election
ISLAMABAD: Amid a boycott by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the upper house of parliament is expected to elect its chairman and deputy chairman on Tuesday almost one month after it became dysfunctional following the retirement of half of its members on March 11.
As many as 43 senators will take oath as members of the house before a schedule is announced for elections to the offices of chairman and deputy chairman the same day.
According to a statement issued by the Senate Secretariat, the upper house will meet at 9am today (Tuesday) and after the oath-taking, the announ­cement regarding the schedule for the election of the chairman and the deputy chairman will be made at 12:30pm.
In the absence of any opposition, the ruling alliance is poised to clinch the slot, with the chairmanship likely going to PPP’s Yousaf Raza Gilani and the deputy chairmanship to a PML-N candidate. The PML-N has yet to announce its nominee, however.
According to the PPP leaders, their campaign to secure victory for Mr Gilani as the chairman of the Senate was in full swing and a special committee had reached out to other political parties to ensure the PPP lawmaker’s win.
According to PPP leader Sherry Rehman, Mr Gilani enjoys significant support within the Senate, and the PPP will formally declare its support for him on April 9, along with its allied parties.
On the other hand, the PTI has decided to continue with its boycott in light of the postponement of Senate elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The polls on 11 seats could not be held after the KP speaker did not administer oath to lawmakers elected on reserved seats. These seats were doled out to the PPP, PML-N, and other parties after the ECP rejected a plea by the PTI and SIC for the allocation of these seats.
 
 

A PTI spokesperson said that the election for the posts of the chairman and deputy chairman of the Senate without representations from all federating units was “unconstitutional and unacceptable”.
He vowed that the PTI would not tolerate “the insult of the upper house to select unelected persons on the constitutional positions of the state from the incomplete electoral college”.
He lamented that the process of violation of the Constitution and democratic principles by the unconstitutional government of ‘Form-47’ continued sans any interval. The spokesperson said that after the postponement of the Senate election in KP, the election of the chairman and deputy chairman of the Senate was a continuation of the “conspiracy to ambush the public mandate”.
He went on to say that keeping an “important federating unit out of the electoral process was part of the nefarious and shameful attempts of a biased group to sow the seed of provincial discard and hatred”.
Senate conundrum
The term of a senator is six years, but half of the lawmakers retire every three years and elections are held to fill the vacancies. These elections normally take place days before the expiry of the senators’ term, but that could not happen this time. The unique situation came about in the absence of an electoral college caused by the failure of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold timely general elections.
Since elections are not to be held on four seats that used to be reserved for the erstwhile tribal areas, as these have been abolished following their merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa under the 25th Amendment, polling to fill 48 vacancies was to be held on April 2.
Out of them, 18 senators had been elected unopposed and elections on 11 Senate seats from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been postponed owing to a controversy surrounding the oaths to the members of the provincial assembly elected on reserved seats.
