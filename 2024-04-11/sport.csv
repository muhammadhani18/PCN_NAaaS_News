UDINE: Inter Milan took another step towards the Serie A title as a last-gasp goal from Davide Frattesi secured a 2-1 come-from-behind win at struggling Udinese on Monday. 
Five minutes into added time, Lautaro Martinez unleashed a low shot that Udinese goalkeeper Maduka Okoye managed to tip onto the post but Italy midfielder Frattesi pounced to slot home the rebound. 
Udinese had stunned the visitors with a soft goal by Lazar Samardzic before the break but Inter were soon level when Hakan Calhanoglu converted a penalty 10 minutes into the second half. 
Runaway leaders Inter are 14 points clear of second-placed AC Milan, boasting 82 points with seven rounds remaining. 
“We absolutely don’t think we’ve won it yet. We have other matches to play and we need to go out and get it,” said Frattesi to Sky Sport. “I’m really happy, it’s a really big win towards we need to do. You can’t win every match 4-0, it’s important that you also manage to win the tough matches.” 
Monday’s win ensured that the champions-elect could seal their 20th Scudetto in a hotly-anticipated derby with their local rivals Milan in a fortnight’s time. 
Claiming the league crown with a sixth straight derby win would be some revenge for Calhanoglu who is detested by Milan supporters after switching sides of the northern Italian city three years ago. 
“In all honesty I don’t like talking about the other side from where I came,” said Calhanoglu. “I respect them and I have a good relationship with the players. What happened in my first year here is history. I’m concentrated on my teammates because they’re fantastic... That’s what matters.” 
For relegation-threatened Udinese, the late goal was like a dagger to the heart of their hard-working defence with the side in 15th place with 28 points, two points above the drop zone. 
“How the game ended really hurts,” Samardzic said. “The point would have mattered a lot but we must look forward with our heads held high and do better in our coming games.”   
Udinese’s defeat after a valiant defensive effort brought sympathy from Inter manager Simone Inzaghi. 
“I would like to congratulate Udinese, they played a great match and losing like this is annoying. But I think they can be saved with their organisation,” Inzaghi told Sky Sports Italia. 
Inzaghi emphasised that his side needed to stay focused on winning a 20th Scudetto and a coveted second star, which is awarded for each 10 titles and is almost within reach. 
“We respected the opponent but we put our heart into, also driven by our fans. We believed and never gave up,” he added. “We have achieved 26 victories in 31 games. A great run. Now we have to stay clear. There is great harmony, everyone helps each other. Eight points to go.”

1,FIFA resolves lawsuit by  sports promoter owned by billionaire Ross,NEW YORK: FIFA has settled an antitrust lawsuit accusing football’s world governing body of illegally banning...,"NEW YORK: FIFA has settled an antitrust lawsuit accusing football’s world governing body of illegally banning foreign clubs and leagues from staging official matches in the United States.
The settlement with Relevent Sports, a sports promoter controlled by billionaire Miami Dolphins American football team owner Stephen Ross, was disclosed in a Monday filing with the US District Court in Manhattan.
It came a little over a year after the federal appeals court in Manhattan revived Relevent’s case, which a trial judge had dismissed in 2021. The US Soccer Federation remains a defendant.
Lawyers for FIFA and US Football did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In a statement, Relevent said FIFA will consider changes to its rules about whether games can be played outside a league’s home territory.
Some European and South American teams already play  “friendly” matches in the United States.
It was not immediately clear whether the settlement would result in non-US teams playing regular season matches there.
FIFA, which has 211 member associations, announced its foreign match policy in October 2018, after Relevent arranged with Spain’s La Liga to host a regular season match between FC Barcelona and Girona FC in Miami.
Barcelona eventually withdrew, and Relevent sued US Soccer in September 2019 after it scuttled a match in Miami between two Ecuadorean teams. FIFA was added as a defendant a year later.
Relevent, based in New York, also operates the International Champions Cup.
The hosting by US stadiums of regular season matches between foreign teams could draw away fans and sponsors now supporting FIFA-affiliated Major League Soccer.
That league got a boost when soccer star Lionel Messi, who helped Argentina win the 2022 World Cup, began playing for Inter Miami last year.
The United States, along with Canada and Mexico, will co-host the World Cup in men’s football in 2026.
The case is Relevent Sports LLC v US Soccer Federation Inc et al, US District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-08359.

2,Football director Murtough to leave Manchester United,"LONDON: John Murtough is to step down as football director of Manchester United and leave Old Trafford, the ...","LONDON: John Murtough is to step down as football director of Manchester United and leave Old Trafford, the faltering Premier League giants said on Tuesday.
United are overhauling their structure following Jim Ratcliffe’s acquisition of a 25 per cent stake in the club, which saw the chairman of chemicals giant INEOS take control of football operations.
Ratcliffe is especially keen to overhaul recruitment at United, with the club reportedly looking to bring in Newcastle sporting director Dan Ashworth and Southampton director of football Jason Wilcox as members of a new leadership team, with Murtough’s exit described as a  “mutual” decision.
“John Murtough is to step down from his position as Football Director of Manchester United and leave the club after almost 11 years in a variety of roles at Carrington (the club’s training ground),” said a United statement.
Ratcliffe added:  “We want to thank John for his loyal service over many years, and for his support and integrity during this period of transition. He leaves with our best wishes for the future.”
United co-chairman Joel Glazer said:  “After 11 years of tireless work for the club, John has mutually agreed with us that now is the right time to step aside and allow the new football leadership structure to be put in place.”
United’s 2-2 draw at home to Liverpool left the Red Devils sixth in the Premier League table, but 11 points behind fifth-placed Aston Villa in the race for European football.
United still have a chance to win a trophy this season after coming from 2-1 and 3-2 down to beat Liverpool 4-3 in a thrilling FA Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford that secured a last-four tie with second-tier Coventry.

The Danish Visma-Lease a Bike rider was hospitalised after suffering rib and collarbone fractures and sustaining lung damage in the shocking incident during the Tour of the Basque Country race.
Vingegaard, 27, who won the Tour de France in 2022 and 2023, is hoping to complete a hat-trick of victories this summer but the crash has put his participation under significant doubt.
“Jonas had a successful operation on his collarbone,” said Visma on social media network X.
“He will now spend the next few weeks recovering. It is not yet clear how long this will take.
“He is doing well and expresses his gratitude to everyone for their kind words over the past few days.”
Remco Evenepoel also broke his collarbone in the crash on stage four of the race in northern Spain, while leader Primoz Roglic retired after he was also fell, along with several other riders, but the Slovenian did not sustain any fractures.
Visma’s other rider Wout van Aert broke his collarbone and several ribs in a high-speed mass pile up during the Around Flanders one-day race.
Last week Visma chief Richard Plugge said cyc­ling needed to take action to keep riders safer.

The 20-day tournament featured 63 matches, equally shared by host venues Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, before culminating on Monday.
Jinnah College emerged victorious in the Karachi-leg event by defeating Government College 36-B Landhi at Eid Gah Stadium by three wickets, while Punjab College clinched the trophy at the LCCA ground by triumphing over Government College University by six wickets. In Islamabad, IMPCC College H-8/4 claimed the title when they defeated Westminster by 63 runs. 
“I assure you that we will organise an even grander and more elaborate tournament next year, encompassing more teams, venues, cities, incentives and rewards,” Mohsin said in a statement on Tuesday. 
“One of the immediate successes of this tournament is the selection of a significant number of players by district teams. 
“These players would have missed out on this opportunity if it weren’t for this tournament.”

The FIFA-appointed PFF NC announced on Tuesday that will hold the National Women’s Football Championship next month which will feature clubs only. With the winners of the women’s championship carrying a vote in the PFF Congress, the move has added fuel to widespread murmurs in the local football fraternity that the Haroon Malik-led NC is trying to influence the elections it will hold.
Pakistan Army, a departmental side, are the current holders of the National Women’s Championship — a title they won when the last completed edition of the event was held in 2020.
“The inclusion of clubs only points to something fishy,” a source close to the matter told Dawn. “There are already question marks over the elections of the Pakistan Football Referees Association.”
The PFRA also carries a vote in the PFF Congress and sources claim that by restricting the women’s championship to clubs only, “the NC is looking to get another vote for its favoured presidential candidate”.
The PFF said that the women’s championship will run from May 5 to May 21 in Karachi.
“The National Women’s Football Championship (NWFC) is set to commence on May 5, 2024 in Karachi,” read a PFF news release “ The clubs that have registered by December 2023 will be eligible to participate in the extravaganza, showcasing the passion for women’s football across Pakistan.
“Being organised by the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF), the championship will see the participating teams divided into four groups. With the top two teams from each group advancing to the quarter-finals.
“The championship will culminate in a finale scheduled to take place on May 21, 2024, where the top contenders will vie for the coveted title of champions. The PFF has extended invitations to all participating clubs, eagerly awaiting their confirmations to finalize the draw and unveil the match schedule along with the designated venues in the coming days.”

Alcaraz, who successfully defended his Indian Wells title last month before losing to Grigor Dimitrov in the Miami Open quarter-finals, was due to face Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime.
Alcaraz may also have an eye on his preparation ahead of the French Open, which begins on May 20.
“I have been working in Monte Carlo and trying to recover until the last minute from an injured pronator teres in my right arm, but it was not possible and I cannot play,” Alcaraz posted on social media. “I was really looking forward to playing See you next year.”

Humbert went out in the first round last year to Italian wildcard Lorenzo Sonego and, after losing the first set to Argentine Coria, the French 14th seed looked in trouble again.
The 25-year-old overcame the setback though and strolled to win the next two sets, breaking Coria’s serve twice in each set.
Karen Khachanov was also made to battle before overcoming Britain’s Cameron Norrie 7-5, 7-6(3). The Russian 15th seed had his serve broken twice in the opening set and was forced into a tiebreak in the second.
Norrie again broke serve twice in the second and at 6-5 up had two break points to win the set but Khachanov hit back with three consecutive aces to hold serve and fired another two aces to take the tiebreak with ease.
Khachanov will face Argentine Francisco Cerundolo in the second round.
Bulgarian ninth seed Grigor Dimitrov, who recently lost the Miami Open final to Jannik Sinner, came through his first-round match with local wildcard Valentin Vacherot by 7-5, 6-2.
Dimitrov, who won his first ATP title in over six years at the Brisbane International in January, was pushed hard in the first set with Vacherot breaking serve in the opening game, but found his groove to ease to victory in the second set.
“I’m just grateful that I was able to get through the match today like that. I know I’m far away from my game right now, but hopefully this is a build-up for me,” Dimitrov said.
Twice Monte Carlo champion Stefanos Tsitsipas is also through to the second round after his opponent Laslo Djere retired injured in the second set. Tsitsipas won the opening set 6-3 and was 3-2 up when the Serb announced his withdrawal.
“I didn’t expect such a finish. This is not something very common when I play,” Greek 12th seed Tsitsipas said.
“I did my job well, and obviously, I’m wishing [Djere a] speedy recovery, because injuries are not fun.”
The top eight seeds received byes to the second round, and Tuesday will see world number one Novak Djokovic in action against Russia’s Roman Safiullin.

8,"Amir, Imad and Usman picked for New Zealand T20 series","LAHORE: Fast bowler Mohammad Amir, all-rounder Imad Wasim along with uncapped players Usman Khan and Mohammad Irfan...","

LAHORE: (From L) Members of the selection committee Asad Shafiq, Abdul Razzaq, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Yousuf and Bilal Afzal address a press conference here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Tuesday.—M. Arif/White Star

 
LAHORE: Fast bowler Mohammad Amir, all-rounder Imad Wasim along with uncapped players Usman Khan and Mohammad Irfan Khan Niazi were named in a 17-member Pakistan T20 squad that was announced by a newly-appointed selection committee on Tuesday for the forthcoming five-match home series against New Zealand. 
Frontline pace bowler Naseem Shah, experienced all-rounder Shadab Khan and mystery spinner Abrar Ahmed also returned to the squad after recovering from injuries and proving their fitness in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) held in February-March. 
The New Zealand series is scheduled to be staged in Rawalpindi and Lahore from April 18 to 27. 
The New Zealand squad is due to arrive in Rawalpindi which will host the first three matches at the Pindi Cricket Stadium while the last two will be held at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore.
The players, who were part of the Pakistan squad which toured New Zealand in January this year, but missed out on the forthcoming series include pacers Haris Rauf (fitness), Aamer Jamal and Wasim Junior, left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz, top-order batter Sahibzada Farhan and wicket-keeper Haseebullah Khan.
“It is the first function of this selection committee and we [five] selectors along with captain and head coach [Azhar Mahmood] decided the team with mutual understanding. The criterion was drafted keeping in view the World Cup as target and every player could see the rotation policy, considering the workload on the player,” Wahab Riaz, a member of the selection committee and senior team manager, said while announcing the squad during a presser at the Gaddafi Stadium on Tuesday.
Sitting in the middle at the presser, Wahab was flanked by fellow selectors inc­luding former Test cricketers Moha­mmad Yousuf, Abdul Razzaq and Asad Shafiq, and Bilal Afzal who is part of the selection body functioning as a data analyst.
Interestingly, Babar Azam, who was re-installed as T20 captain recently after former skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi was removed after just one series at the helm as Pakistan were drubbed 4-1 in New Zealand, and newly appointed head coach Azhar Mahmood, were not present at the presser as members of the selection committee.
“A day earlier, we held a discussion with all the 29 probables who attended a fitness camp in Kakul, saying to them ‘congratulations will be to those who will be selected and who could not get the nod will remain the part [of the system] in the future’.
“We have selected the best team having the input of the captain and the coach,” Wahab added.
Wahab defended the decision to pick Amir and Imad — both of whom had reversed their retirement decisions last month — for national duty.
“The decision to include Imad and Amir was a straightforward one, given their availability for selection and considering [pacer] Haris’s injury and Nawaz’s current form. Both Amir and Imad possess undeniable match-winning capabilities, and we trust they will consistently deliver strong performances to bolster the team’s objectives,” Wahab said.
Orthodox left-arm spinner Imad has played 66 T20 Internationals in which he has scored 486 runs at a strike-rate of 131.7 and taken 65 wickets at an economy-rate of 6.26. He last played for Pakistan 12 months ago at his home ground in Rawalpindi against New Zealand.
Left-armer Amir, who last played for Pakistan in August 2020 at Old Trafford against England, has played in 50 T20Is in which he has taken 59 wickets at an economy-rate of 7.02.
Wahab hoped that Haris would be available for next month’s T20 tour of England.
Wahab emphasised a specific selection policy, which at the moment was aimed at preparing the team for the all-important T20 World Cup scheduled for June this year. 
“We will follow a rotation policy to keep our players fit for the T20 World Cup which is our target,” said Wahab.
“We have communicated our overarching selection policy and strategy to all elite players, and there is complete alignment within the group. To ensure the policy’s implementation in letter and spirit, I will closely collaborate with the team management during the series,” he added.
“As we prepare for the T20 World Cup in the US and West Indies, this series holds significant importance for Pakistan. Rather than solely focusing on the formidable New Zealand side, we aim to introspect and identify areas for improvement. I anticipate that players will seize the opportunities presented to strengthen their claims for the World Cup.”
Wahab added, “The rotation policy could also be implemented on Babar.”
The 28-year-old Usman was included in Pakistan squad, just four days after he was banned by the Emirates Cricket Board.
He was the second highest run-scorer in the last PSL (430 runs in seven matches) while also on the books as a player in a United Arab Emirates (UAE) league.
The ECB charged him with breaching his obligations to the Board after he attended the Kakul training camp. He was eventually banned from playing cricket in the UAE for five years.
Wahab justified Usman’s selection.
“Usman has been scoring runs for the last two, three years so he deserved selection and if there are any other issues the Pakistan Cricket Board will be dealing with them,” Wahab said.
Delighted at his selection, Usman said he would try to grasp the opportunity with both hands.
“Being chosen to represent one’s country is the ultimate dream and goal for any athlete. Today, I am absolutely thrilled and filled with joy as the selectors have granted me the opportunity to be part of the upcoming series against New Zealand,” Usman, who represented Multan Sultans in the PSL, said.
“This selection validates the relentless effort and dedication I have poured into my craft, and I am fully committed to upholding the high standards I have set for myself.”
Right-handed Irfan was adjudged the Emerging Player and Best Fielder of this year’s HBL PSL after scoring 171 runs at a strike-rate of 140.16. Overall, the 21-year-old Mianwali-born player has featured in 34 T20s in which he has scored 499 runs at a strike-rate of 135.96. Irfan also represented Pakistan in the ICC U-19 World Cups in 2020 and 2022.
Speaking on his selection for the New Zealand series, Irfan said he would try to make a permanent place in the team with solid performances.
“I am deeply honoured to have been selected in the Pakistan squad for the upcoming T20 series against New Zealand. Breaking into such a formidable team like Pakistan is a testament to the dedication and effort I have put into my game. Now, my focus is on seizing this opportunity and solidifying my position within the team,” Irfan, a player of Karachi Kings franchise, said.
“I am fully committed to continuing to work diligently and proving myself worthy of the trust placed in me by the captain and selectors.”
Expressing his views at the press conference, former batting maestro Yousuf congratulated Usman and Irfan for getting selected in the national squad and hoped that they would give their best.
“Their selection is also a cause of inspiration for the other young players, who want to make a place in the Pakistan team,” he said.
To a question, Wahab said the selected players along with five reserves would be the nucleus for the selectors till the World Cup.
Answering a question regarding the responsibility of senior team manager whi­ch had been given to him for the first time, Wahab said PCB chairman Mohsin Raza Naqvi had already said that he would give additional responsibility to some officials 
“[As manager] I will see the team management affairs. Additionally, I will be observing, as a member of the selection body, the implementation of the selection policy during the [New Zealand] series.”
When it was pointed out to Yousuf that being the most senior cricketer among the selectors, he should lead the selection committee, the former middle-order batsman said, “It is a decision of the PCB which has decided to give all the members equal powers to take the decision through majority. It is good, as earlier all powers were held by the chief selector.”
Responding to a question on who would be the vice-captain, Wahab said the discussion on the subject was still under way.
To a query, Wahab termed former PCB chairman Ramiz Raja’s reported comment over Amir’s comeback to the national fold as negative.
Wahab said the negative reporting on social media had raised a perception that if a fitness camp in Kakul had not been set up the players would have remained in their ‘groups’, in the backdrop of the change in national T20 captaincy.
“It was witnessed in Kakul, how happy and united the players were with each other,” Wahab said.
When recalled that while few months ago when Babar was removed as captain both Wahab and Razzaq favoured the decision whereas now they were now backing the batter in the hot seat, Wahab said the decision of changing the skipper was based on workload management.
“Shaheen is Pakistan’s main strike bowler and one of the best in the world. To continue with the rotation policy, keeping in view the workload of Shaheen, who has faced fitness problems, it was decided to bring Babar back as captain as he is the most experienced batter, having the good experience of captaincy, and the team needs such a captain in the World Cup,” Wahab justified.
Speaking at the presser, Razzaq said, “Obviously when anyone watches players from outside it looks different. However, after becoming selector and watching the situation closely, I feel Babar is the best choice [as captain].”
Squad: Babar Azam (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Azam Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohmmad Amir, Mohammad Irfan Khan Niazi, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Usama Mir, Usman Khan, Zaman Khan. 
Non-travelling reserves: Haseebullah, Mohammad Ali, Mohammad Wasim Jr, Sahibzada Farhan, Salman Ali Agha.

9,CL host nations tighten security after Islamic State threats,PARIS: France and Spain will step up security ahead of the Champions League quarter-finals in Madrid and Paris on...,"PARIS: France and Spain will step up security ahead of the Champions League quarter-finals in Madrid and Paris on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, top officials said, as Islamic State threats cast a shadow over Europe’s top club football tournament. 
British police said they were aware of reports of threats and had a robust policing plan in place ahead of Arsenal’s match against Bayern Munich in London on Tuesday night. 
European football’s governing body UEFA said all four games in Paris, Madrid and London would go ahead despite the threat. 
The threats against some of the world’s most-watched football matches underline the resurgence of Islamic State after several deadly attacks this year, including in Iran and Moscow. They also point to the complex geopolitical backdrop to the world’s biggest single sporting event, the Olympic Games, set to take place in Paris in July and August. 
At a press event to discuss Olympic security on Tuesday, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters that security would be  “considerably reinforced” when Paris St Germain take on Barcelona in the first leg at the Parc des Princes in Paris on Wednesday. 
Darmanin said there had been “a clear threat publicly expressed by the Islamic State”. 
“The police, whom I spoke to very early this morning, have considerably reinforced the security measures,” he said. “We have seen, among other things, a communication from the Islamic State that particularly targets stadiums. It is not new. 
“This morning we asked the general director of interior security to communicate the information we have with the other [security] services of the other countries hosting the quarter-finals.” 
Islamic State published a post urging followers to recreate a November 2015 attack on the Stade de France stadium, according to Site Intelligence group, which tracks Islamic militant communications. 
“Recreate the glory of the Paris 2015 raid and subdue the Crusaders in masses,” said the post, which included an image of PSG’s Parc des Princes stadium. 
Real Madrid play Manchester City in the Spanish capital on Tuesday night as Arsenal take on Bayern Munich in London. Atletico Madrid then host Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night at the same time as PSG play Barcelona.  
PSG defender Danilo said he and his team-mates “need to concentrate on the football,” but coach Luis Enrique said the threat was worrying. 
“Of course, it’s worrying ... Who in this room isn’t worried?” Luis Enrique told reporters. “It’s something I hope can be controlled, and that they’re just threats and that nothing disastrous happens.”  
Spanish police forces will deploy more than 2,000 officers to boost security in the capital for the two games there, government spokesperson Pilar Alegria told reporters on Tuesday. 
“We are going to have an exceptional deployment of security services, in line with the level of alert set out by the intelligence services,” Francisco Martin Aguirre, the government’s delegate for Madrid, said in a video message. 
In London, the Metropolitan Police said it was aware of the calls to target matches. 
London police’s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said in a statement: “We’re aware of online and media reports in relation to calls to target matches across Europe and here in London. 
“However, I want to reassure the public that we have a robust policing plan in place for tonight’s match and we continue to work closely alongside the club’s security team to ensure that the match passes peacefully.” 
UEFA said all the matches would be played. 
“UEFA is aware of alleged terrorist threats made towards this week’s UEFA Champions League matches and is closely liaising with the authorities at the respective venues,” the statement said. 
“All matches are planned to go ahead as scheduled with appropriate security arrangements in place.” 
After being largely crushed by a US-led coalition, Islamic State has been operating in the shadows in recent years, slowly rebuilding its capabilities via underground sleeper cells. 
Its Afghan branch, known as ISIS-K, has been particularly active in recent months. The group claimed responsibility for a mass-fatality attack at a concert near Moscow last month, and also carried out twin bombings in Iran that killed nearly 100 people earlier this year, according to US-intercepted communications.

The first two of the three World Test Championship matches will be back-to back at Hagley Oval, Christchurch, from November 28 and at the Basin Reserve, Wellington, from December 6.
The third and final Test will be at Hamilton’s Seddon Park beginning December 14.
There were capacity crowds for the first three days of both of New Zealand’s recent home Tests against Australia and New Zealand Cricket (NZC) hope the five-day games against England will also bring in the fans in huge numbers. 
“In the past there’s often been a lot of talk in New Zealand about the popularity of Test cricket, without that translating into ticket sales,” said NZC chief executive Scott Weenink. 
“The difference over the past summer, and in terms of the upcoming Tests against England, is that the interest is being converted to bums on seats and is driving record viewership numbers. 
“We’re looking forward to that continuing.”

Northern Irishman McIlroy, the world number two, is looking to complete the career grand slam this week by claiming the green jacket that has eluded him so far in his career.
Top-ranked Scheffler tasted success at Augusta in 2022 and arrives on a hot streak after wins last month at the Arnold Palmer Championship and The Players Championship and a runner-up effort at the Houston Open.
The pair are joined by Tokyo Olympic gold medalist Xander Schauffele, who has yet to win a major championship but finished tied for second in the Masters in 2019.
The trio will tee off at 10.42 am local on Thursday, just minutes after defending champion Jon Rahm will begin his bid.
Rahm will play with England’s Matt Fitzpatrick, the 2022 US Open champion and American Nick Dunlap, who turned professional earlier this year after winning the American Express tournament on the PGA Tour in January.
Tiger Woods, a 15-time major winner, will make his 26th start at the Masters alongside Australian Jason Day and American Max Homa.
Immediately following McIlroy and Scheffler’s group will be a talented trio of reigning US Open champion Wyndham Clark, 2022 British Open champion Cameron Smith of Australia and Norwegian Viktor Hovland.

12,Olympic rings to be displayed on Eiffel Tower for Paris Games,Work to set the rings on the tower will begin at the end of the month after the Olympic torch has left ancient Olympia in Greece.,"PARIS: The Olympic rings for the Paris Games will be displayed on the Eiffel Tower, the president of the monument’s operating company (SETE) said.
Jean-Francois Martins said work to set the rings on the tower would begin at the end of the month after the Olympic torch has left ancient Olympia in Greece. The rings will be on the Seine side of the tower.
The Eiffel Tower will be a central part of the Paris Olympics, marking the 38km point of the marathon while the beach volleyball event will be held at its base.
The Olympic flame will be positioned at the Jardin des Tuileries, near the Louvre.

In the week leading up to the opening ceremony, police will put in place a vast anti-terror zone stretching all along the river Seine which athletes are set to sail down when the Games begin on July 26.
Around 20,000 homes lie inside the zone and anyone wanting to enter it — including workers or tourists with a hotel or apartment reservation — will need to have registered beforehand on a government website to obtain a QR code.
“Parisians will have five ways of crossing Paris during the week of preparations for the opening ceremony, one pedestrian bridge... and four bridges open to pedestrians and traffic,” Darmanin told reporters.
The closures underline the scale of the security challenge posed by the hugely ambitious opening ceremony which will see teams sail down a 6.0-kilometre (3.7-mile) stretch of the river in more than 100 boats.
Crossing the capital on the underground metro system will still be possible, but around 15 stations inside the anti-terror zone will be closed.
The high-security zone will shrink after the opening ceremony to the areas in the immediate vicinity of sports venues, which are dotted around the capital.
“It will be a magnificent moment for France and for the Olympics,” Darmanin said of the opening ceremony, stressing that no country had ever organised one outside the main athletics stadium.
A total of 326,000 spectators are expected to witness the ceremony with tickets, while up to 200,000 others will watch from homes overlooking the Seine or from residential river boats.

CHARLESTON: American Danielle Collins continued her late career rich vein of form, winning the WTA Charleston Open clay court title on Sunday with a 6-2, 6-1 defeat of Russia’s Daria Kasatkina.
The victory comes a week after Collins enjoyed the biggest win of her career, clinching the Miami Open 1000 hard court title and her back-to-back wins means she will move up to 15th in the world rankings.
The 30-year-old Collins has announced that she will retire from the sport at the end of this season but has found herself playing in the form of her life and has extended her winning streak to 13 matches.
Kasatkina, the 2017 winner in Charleston, reached the final after a three-set semi-final win over top seed Jessica Pegula but Collins proved to be a step too far.
Collins, who defeated Greece’s Maria Sakkari in her semi, needed just 77 minutes to defeat Kasatkina and the contest moved decisively in her direction when she broke to go 2-0 up in the second set, celebrating with a forceful first-pump.
The change in surface from Miami made little difference to Collins who mar­ched to victory with her powerful strokeplay that was simply too much for the 26-year-old Russian.
Collins won 95.2% of first serve points and saved the two break points that she faced.
“I’m blessed to be able to have the oppo­rtunity to live out my dream, I am so grateful,” said Collins.
Kasatkina joked that she was glad to know that Collins would be leaving the tour after this season.
“I was going to stay that I’m going to miss you on the tour but after this match, I’m not sure,” she quipped.
“I am going to miss you because you are such a character, your personality is amazing. Enjoy these moments, you are playing amazing,” she said.
The Floridian has dropped just two of 28 sets in her last two tournaments.
The last player to win Miami and Charleston in the same year was Serena Williams in 2013.
Collins’ 22 wins for the season is matched only by world number one Iga Swiatek and fourth-ranked Elena Rybakina.

Germany international Ridle Baku scored his first league goal of the season as Wolfsburg got off to a perfect start inside seven minutes — but that is as good as it got for the hosts.
Gladbach staged a second-half comeback, with Ko Itakura, Nathan Ngou­mou and Rocco Reitz scoring the goals that kept the Foals in the safety of mid-table.
It is Gladbach’s first away win since September in all competitions and leaves Wolfsburg with only one win since the turn of the year — last weekend’s 2-0 victory at Werder Bremen in Hasenh­uettl’s first game in charge.
Wolfsburg remain in 14th place, five points off the relegation play-off spot.
While Wolfsburg and Boru­ssia Moenc­heng­ladbach are among the Bundesliga’s unde­r­a­chievers, Sunday’s earlier game saw the meeting of two of the league’s overachievers.
Eighth-placed Hoffe­nheim ended a run of three straight de­f­e­ats with a 3-1 home victory over Augsburg, seventh, who came into the game on the back of a five-game unbea­ten run.
Hoffenheim raced into a 2-0 lead inside 20 minutes, with Wout Weghorst and Andrej Kra­m­­aric putting the hosts in charge.
Ermedin Demirovic hal­v­ed Hoffenheim’s advantage on the hour mark but Ihlas Bebou fired in a late third to rubber-stamp the win.

16,Spurs bolster CL qualifying bid with Forest victory,LONDON: Tottenham Hotspur boosted their Champions League qualifying hopes with a 3-1 home win over...,"LONDON: Tottenham Hotspur boosted their Champions League qualifying hopes with a 3-1 home win over relegation-battling Notti­ngham Forest on Sunday to move into fourth spot in the Premier League.
Second-half goals from Micky van de Ven and Pedro Porro, after Forest’s Chris Wood had cancelled out Murillo’s own goal in the opening period, helped Spurs capitalise on rivals Aston Villa and Manchester United dropping points this weekend.
Tottenham’s victory puts them level with Villa on 60 points but with a game in hand and leaves United trailing with 49 after their 2-2 draw with Liverpool.
Spurs coach Ange Postecoglou, however, told reporters that he  “couldn’t care less about the race for fourth, what I care about is the way the team is progressing”.
Tottenham led after 15 minutes when Braz­ilian Murillo, who minutes earlier almost sco­r­ed an audacious goal from inside his own half, turned Timo Werner’s cross into his own net.
Brennan Johnson then nearly doubled the home side’s lead agai­nst his former club but the forwa­rd’s effort was stopped by the str­ong hand of goalkeeper Matz Sels.
Spurs were rampant and a second goal seemed like an inevitability until Forest equalised against the run of play in the 27th minute through Wood’s fourth goal in 
four games.
The New Zealand striker should have had a second 10 minutes before the break but smashed his shot against the post from close range.
Forest felt Spurs should have been down to 10 men shortly before halftime after James Maddison appeared to strike Ryan Yates off the ball but VAR declined to intervene.
“It doesn’t look like he punched him, he punched him,” Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo told reporters.
“I was surprised that VAR didn’t tell (referee) Simon (Hooper) to review it because, honestly, with all my respect, Maddison loses his composure and it’s a punch in the stomach.”
Postecoglou revamped his midfield at the break, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Rodrigo Bentancur replacing Yves Bissouma and Pape Matar Sarr in a double switch that helped Spurs regain control.
Dutch defender van de Ven hit a thunderbolt from the edge of the area to restore Spurs’ lead after 52 minutes before Pedro Porro produced a great finish six minutes later.
The defeat leaves Forest 17th with 25 points from 32 games, above third-bottom Luton Town only on goal difference.
In  Sunday’s other game, Ole McBurnie’s last-gasp equaliser forced Chelsea  to settle for a 2-2 draw at basement club Sheffield United.
Chelsea took the lead after 11  minutes as Thiago Silva finished off Conor Gallagher’s corner at the far  post.
The Blades equalised in the 32nd minute as Gustavo Hamer’s pass sent  Jayden Bogle through on goal and the right wing-back slotted home.
Noni Madueke put Chelsea back in front in the 66th minute, cutting in from the right to drive his shot into the far corner.
Yet mid-table Chelsea’s troubled season suffered another setback  when McBurnie levelled with a close-range finish three minutes into  stoppage-time.
The Blades remain bottom of the table on 16 points with seven games  left, while Chelsea are  ninth on 44 after extending their unbeaten run to seven league games.

17,Everton deducted two more points,"LONDON: Everton have received a two-point dedu­ction, their second points cut this season, after the club’s ...","LONDON: Everton have received a two-point dedu­ction, their second points cut this season, after the club’s appeal against a Premier League charge for a breach of Profitability and Sustain­ability Rules (PSR) was unsuccessful, the league said on Monday.
The independent commission heard evidence and arguments from the club on a range of potential mitigating factors for its admitted breach of 16.6 million pounds ($21 million), including the impact of its two successive PSR charges, the league said.
“The commission determined the appropriate san­c­tion to be a two-point ded­u­ction, taking effect immediately,” it said in a statement.
The deduction leaves Ever­ton in 16th place on 27 points, two above the relegation zone.
Everton said it planned to appeal again. 
“The club and its legal representatives have beg­un the preparations to app­eal the commissions decision,” it said.  “Everton remains committed to  working collaboratively with the Lea­gue on all matters relating to PSR  but is extremely concerned by the inconsistency of different commissions  in res­pect of points deductions applied.”
Everton admitted to a breach of PSR for  the assessment period ending with the 2021-22 season, having incurred  124.5 million pounds in losses in that period. The club were  subsequently deducted 10 points in November for that breach, although  that was reduced to six on appeal.

Brest are 10 points behind leaders Paris St-Germain but four poi­n­ts clear of Lille, who lie just outside the automatic Champions Le­a­gue qualification spots in fourth.
“After going behind, we came back with some good football. And then there was that last quarter of an hour... but it was a good lesson to learn,” said Brest coach Eric Roy.
“We can’t relax too much, and we have to keep our wits about us right to the end. We saw the best and the worst of Brest, but in the end we won.”
Ismael Traore gave the visitors an early lead but Brest hit back with goals from Brendan Chardonnet, Kamory Doumbia and Steve Mounie giving them a 3-1 cushion at half-time.
Martin Satriano added a fourth on the hour to make a home win appear a certainty.
Metz, who are second-bottom five points from safety, hit back, however, with two goals in six minutes from Georges Mikautadze making it a nervous final 10 minutes for Brest.
Meanwhile, Monaco exte­nded their unbeaten run in Ligue 1 to six games with a  1-0 win over Rennes at the Stade Louis II, when both teams had  a player sent off and the home side moved back into third place thanks  to Maghnes Akliouche’s goal.
The  first half was full of attacking promise from both sides but the only  goal came in the 25th mi­n­ute when Ismail Jakobs pulled the ball back  towards the penalty spot to Akliouche whose shot found the bottom corner  of the net.
The opening minute after the break brought a red card  for Rennes forward Martin Terrier for a dangerous foul on Aklio­uche,  but less than 20 minutes later Monaco also went down to 10 men when  Thilo Kehrer was shown his second yellow card.
The visitors had  chances to level the game, with Monaco kee­per Radoslaw Majecki pulling  off a fine save at full stretch from Ludovic Blas, and the home side  held on to take all three points.
Rennes are ninth on 39 points  after their second consecutive league loss, in a week which also brought  defeat in the Coupe de France semi-final when they lost 1-0 at PSG on  Wednesday.
Elsewhere, Montpellier put distance between themselves and the relegation play-off spot with a 2-0 win at home to Lorient.
The win takes Montpellier to 13th place and six points clear of Lor­­i­ent in the play-off spot of 16th.
OGC Nice dropped further away from the Champions League spots with a 0-0 draw at Reims and Toulouse also played out a goalless draw at home to RC Strasbourg.
Goals in the final 15 minutes by Alexandre Lacazette, Malick Fofana and Gift Orban gave Olympique Lyonnais a 3-1 win at Nantes after they fell behind to Matthis Abline’s 16th-minute opener, leaving the hosts just two points above the relegation zone.

19,Poistogova-Guliyev set to lose  Olympic silver,MOSCOW: Ekaterina Poistogova-Guliyev looks set to lose her silver medal from the 800 metres at the London Olympics...,"MOSCOW: Ekaterina Poistogova-Guliyev looks set to lose her silver medal from the 800 metres at the London Olympics after being banned for four years for historic doping by the Russian Athletics Federation (RusAF).
The 33-year-old, who competed for Russia before switching allegiance to Turkey, had all of her results from July 2012 to Oct. 2014 voided after being found guilty of the use or attempted use of banned substances, RusAF said in a statement.
The punishment was for infractions in 2012 and 2013 and based on data from the Moscow anti-doping laboratory, the statement added.
Competing as Ekaterina Poistogova, she finished third in the 2012 Olympic final on Aug 12 but was upgraded to second when Russian winner Mariya Savinova was found guilty of doping offences.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) recommended that Poistogova-Guliyev be banned for life and have her London medal stripped in 2015 as the result of their investigations into state-sponsored systematic doping in Russian athletics.
Poistogova-Guliyev was eventually banned for two years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2017 but her results were voided only back to October 2015, allowing her to keep her Olympic medal.
The final decision on the stripping and reallocation of medals rests with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), who were not immediately available to comment.
If Poistogova-Guliyev is stripped of her medal, Kenyan Pamela Jelimo would be awarded the silver with American Alysia Montano taking the bronze.
The women’s middle distance events at the London Olympics were heavily tainted by doping with three runners in the 800m final since having their results voided — Savinova, Poistogova-Guliyev and sixth-placed Russian Elena Arzhakova.
Five of the 13 runners in the 1,500m final were also subsequently banned for doping offences.
Poistogova-Guliyev has been banned only until 2026 because allowance was given for the two-year ban she served after the CAS decision, RusAF said.

20,Juventus back in form with triumph over Fiorentina,TURIN: Juventus returned to winning ways after four league games without a victory thanks to a 1-0 success against...,"TURIN: Juventus returned to winning ways after four league games without a victory thanks to a 1-0 success against Fiorentina with a first-half goal from Federico Gatti to consolidate their hold on third place in Serie A on Sunday.
Juve now have 62 points, closing the gap with second-placed AC Milan to six and extending their lead over Bologna in fourth to four points. Inter Milan are top with 79 points and next face Udinese. Fiorentina are 10th on 43 points.
The hosts had three goals ruled out for offside in the opening half but took the lead in the 21st minute through Gatti, which turned out to be the winner.
Juventus were pushed harder after the break but held on for a second victory in 10 league games after they won their Coppa Italia semi-final, first leg 2-0 against Lazio in midweek.
“A very important victory after two very difficult months, we have a lot to play for and we have to be ready,” Gatti told DAZN.
Fiorentina enjoyed the lion’s share of possession early on, while the hosts looked more dangerous, twice finding the net in the opening 12 minutes with both efforts ruled out for offside.
Dusan Vlahovic, searching for his first goal against his former club, was furious about the second one as his header took a touch of his team-mate Bremer in an offside position.
It seemed only a matter of time before Juve broke the deadlock and after Bremer’s looping header from a corner came off the far post, Gatti was there to tap home from close range. 
Before the break, Cristiano Biraghi had Fiorentina’s first shot in anger, but his long-range effort was wide of the post.
“Too much respect for Juventus and too timid in the first half,” Fiore­ntina manager Vincenzo Italiano told DAZN.
Fiorentina improved after the break and were denied an equaliser when Nicolas Gonzalez curled a left-foot shot from outside the area which goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny managed to tip onto the crossbar with the ball headed for the top corner.
In the final minutes, the visitors had another chance but when substitute Lucas Beltran struck from close range his team mate M’Bala Nzola blocked the goal-bound effort and Juventus held on as Fiorentina’s awful away record in Turin continues.
The Viola have now lost 12 of their last 13 games at Juve.
“In the end we risked conceding an equaliser, we made a few mistakes but I can’t blame the lads for anything,” Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri said to DAZN. “We’re having a good season, we’re doing everything we can to try to improve. These three points are important.”
Earlier on Sunday, a trio of fantastic goals helped Napoli to a thrilling 4-2 win at Monza.
Trailing at half-time to Milan Djuric’s early header and loudly  barracked by protesting away fans, champions Napoli roared back to win  at Monza following sumptuous strikes from Victor Osimhen, Matteo  Politano and Piotr Zielinski in six second-half minutes.
Andrea  Colpani’s deflected shot clo­s­ed the gap to one, seconds after  Zielinski’s first goal since October, but Giacomo Raspadori added the  fourth in the 69th minute to ensure Napoli went seventh. Two points ahead of Nap­oli, in sixth, are Atalanta who fell to a  surprise 2-1 defeat at Cagliari but have a game in hand, against  Fiorentina.
Frosinone, who won Serie B last season, are a point  behind Hellas Verona who sit just outside the relegation zone after losing 2-1  to mid-table Genoa.

21,"Azhar Mahmood named head coach for New Zealand T20s, squad to be announced today",Member of the national selection committee Wahab Riaz will also accompany the Pakistan squad during the series.,"LAHORE/ISLAMA­BAD: Former Pakistan all-rounder Azhar Mahmood will be the national side’s head coach for the upcoming five-match Twenty20 International series against New Zealand, the country’s cricket board announced on Monday.
Azhar’s appointment, however, is a makeshift one, as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) continues its search for foreign coaches for long term roles in separate positions for white and red-ball formats.
Azhar, who featured in 164 matches for Pakistan, served the side as its bowling coach from 2016 to 2019. The New Zealand series will be his first assignment as the national team’s head coach.
The 49-year-old comes with rich experience of coaching in the T20 format, having led Pakistan Super League champions Islamabad United’s backroom staff since 2021 after stints as bowling coach with Karachi Kings and Multan Sultans.
The ex-pacer and right-handed batter will be assisted by former star Mohammad Yousuf — who is also one of the selectors — as batting coach, meanwhile Saeed Ajmal will carry out duties as the spin bowling coach. Aftab Khan has returned as Pakistan’s fielding coach.
Member of the national selection committee Wahab Riaz will also accompany the Pakistan squad during the series, but in an unusual role as a “senior” team manager in the presence of seasoned Mans­oor Rana, who has been appointed as the team manager.
Dawn understands Wahab’s role in the dressing room will be far from that of a team manager. He is, in fact, going to ensure the selection policies — which includes rotation of players and giving opportunities to younger players — are implemented smoothly.
The said policies were communicated during a meeting in Islamabad on Monday to the 29 Pakistan probables, who took part in the fitness boot camp that concluded on Sunday at the country’s military academy in Kakul.
In the meeting, “the selection committee took the players in confidence regarding the selection policy, which includes rotation policy and providing opportunities to new players”, said a PCB press release. The meeting was attended by all members of the selection committee, namely Abdul Razzaq, Asad Shafiq, Bilal Afzal, Hasan Cheema, Yousuf, Wahab and Usman Wahla.
Pakistan mainstay Mohammad Rizwan did not attend the meeting as he travelled to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage. The national side’s squad will be announced on Tuesday.
According to sources, there’s a high chance a number of less experienced players will be named in the Pakistan squad for the New Zealand series, with the BlackCaps, scheduled to land in Islamabad on April 14, depleted with seven of their top players absent due to their involvement in the ongoing Indian Premier League.
While veteran Imad Was­im and Mohammad Amir – who had rescinded their retirements recently — are set to be selected, Usman Khan , who gave up prospects to play for the United Arab Emirates, is highly likely to make it to the squad.
Shaheen Shah Afridi, who was ripped off Pakis­tan captaincy after just one series in charge to be replaced by former skipper Babar Azam, may also be rested as an attempt to manage the pacer’s workload.
The likes of young left-arm spinner Mehran Mumtaz, fast bowler Mohammad Ali, leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed and wicket-keeper Azam Khan could also be included.
After the series, Pakistan will travel to Ireland and England to feature in T20I series following which the team will travel to the United States and the West Indies to feature in the T20 World Cup.

22,Real looking for revenge against City in Champions League quarters,The Spanish giants also have a point to prove after being routed 4-0 by City.,"LONDON: Real Madrid v Manchester City. 
The all-time kings of Europe take on the current holders in the standout tie of the Champions League quarter-finals. 
For the third year running Real and City meet in a match-up in which the winner has gone on to lift the trophy in the past two seasons. And it would be difficult to look beyond either team going on to continue that streak this time around. 
City are still in contention for back-to-back trebles after winning the Premier League title, Cham­pions League and FA Cup last year. 
Real, reinvigorated by the signing of Jude Bellingham last summer, are eight points clear at the top of La Liga and aiming for a record-extending 15th European Cup title. 
The Spanish giants also have a point to prove after being routed 4-0 by City in the second leg of last year’s semi-finals. 
Then it was City who had a score to settle, having suffered a late collapse at the Santiago Bernabeu to crash out in the semi-finals in 2022. 
Manager Pep Guardiola will likely know how motivated Real will be to exact revenge — just as his players were last year — and that adds a subplot to a tie that is already heavy on intrigue. 
Real host City at the Bernabeu on Tuesday in a mouthwatering first-leg clash and Real manager Carlo Ancelotti admitted he was rather anxious about facing the reigning champions for a third year running. 
“I’m very nervous. The hours before the match, on a personal level,” Ancelotti told a news conference on Monday. “Is defeat suffering and victory, happiness? No, it’s really a relief. Because the days after are calmer. Suffering is part of the job, it keeps you alive, it’s fuel for me. 
“It will be an attractive football match, each team has its own characteristics, with a lot of quality in both teams. This quality will make for a very nice match on a technical level.” 
Elsewhere, Paris Saint-Germain versus Barcelona is another clash of heavyweights — the first leg of which will be played on Wedn­esday, with Kylian Mbappe aiming to finally lead the French champions to European club football’s elite trophy before walking away at the end of the season. 
Premier League title-chasing Arsenal take on a Bayern Munich team that is limping towards the end of a miserable campaign in the Bundesliga on Tuesday, while Atletico Madrid face Borussia Dortmund a day later. 
‘COURAGE AND PERSONALITY’ 
Real have all of their attacking players clicking. 
Bellingham has struck 20 goals in 32 games this season, including four in the Champions League. Vinicius Junior is peaking just in time to face City with five goals in his last three appearances. Brahim Diaz provides a spark off the bench. And Rodyrgo ended a six-week scoring drought in Madrid’s last game, a 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao, to keep it on course for winning the domestic league title. 
Real are on a 27-game unbeaten run at the Bernabeu across all competitions dating back to last April. 
Ancelotti said his team played without courage or personality when City knocked them out of the Champions League last season and called on his players to show more mental strength this time around. 
“We played without courage, without personality — courage and personality are fundamental in this type of game, we lacked them in the second leg,” Ancelotti said. 
“The important thing is to be at our best, the mental aspect is very important. In terms of courage and personality, we’ve had time to prepare for the game, we’ve prepared very well, and I am confident that we will give our best and we’ve got the quality to compete.” 
City have found their scoring form over the past week after hitting four goals in each of its games against Aston Villa and Crystal Palace to stay on the heels of title rivals Liverpool and Arsenal. 
ENRIQUE REUNION 
After a difficult start to his coaching career at PSG, when he had to put up with Mbappe’s bitter contract saga, Luis Enrique has steadily won over fans and the French media — even if it meant dropping Mbappe or taking him off in games. 
Enrique won the treble as Barcelona coach in 2015 with Lionel Messi in his team and is still in contention to do the same at PSG with Mbappe. 
Losing has become a distant memory for PSG, which is undefeated in 27 matches since a loss away to AC Milan in November during the Champions League group stage. But playing a rested Barcelona side could be the toughest test of the season. 
Xavi Hernandez attempted to shock his team into getting its act together by saying he would quit at the end of the season, something that has coincided with a certain improvement. 
Barca have gone unbeaten in 11 straight games since Xavi said in late January that he was renouncing the final year of his contract. 
Robert Lewandowski, teenager Lamine Yamal and Raphinha are all playing well of late, but the midfield is a big question mark due to injury concerns. 
TUCHEL TROUBLE 
Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel wants to end a “frustrating” season, and his tenure, on a high with a trip to Wembley for the Champions League final. But their preparation for Arsenal could hardly have been worse after its latest defeat, this time to Heidenheim on Saturday after leading 2-0. 
Two-time Champions League winner Thomas Mueller said his side could harness the frustration and unleash it on Tuesday. 
“This result has me in fighting mode,” Mueller said. “Self-pity doesn’t help us at all. The resentment inside me is smiling again.” 
The mood at Arsenal is very different with Mikel Arteta’s team looking better equipped to last the course in the race for the title this year after a late collapse last season. 
The Champions League run feels like an unexpected bonus, but victory against Bayern will strengthen belief that a trophy double could be on. 
“We are in a really good moment. We have the squad healthy, with a really good energy, with a lot of confidence individually and collectively,” Arteta said after Saturday’s Premier League win at Brighton & Hove Albion. “We just have to carry on doing what we’re doing.” 
ATLETICO SLUMP 
Atletico have slumped in recent weeks, with six losses and only four wins in their last 12 games overall, as they missed the goals and creativity of Antoine Griezmann. The France forward is now back playing and will be looking for his first goal since Jan 18. 
Diego Simeone’s side were enjoying a 25-game unbeaten run at its Metropolitano Stadium until Barca delivered a 3-0 rout at Atletico on March 27. 
Dortmund have generally saved their best for the Champions League this season but the Spanish side are the slight favorites and have an advantage of having 10 days without a game to prepare for the first leg at the Atletico’s Metropolitano Stadium. 
“It’s better for us to have longer time to prepare for such an important game,” Atletico central defender Stefan Savic admitted in the El Mundo Deportivo newspaper. “I don’t know if it’s better or not that the first game is at home, because if you do a good job in the first leg, it’s difficult for your rival to overturn the result later. The big thing is that we are at home now.” 
Champions League quarter-final first leg fixtures (all times GMT): 
Tuesday: Real Madrid v Manchester City (1900), Arsenal v Bayern Munich (1900). 
Wednesday: Paris St Germain v Barcelona (1900), Atletico Madrid v Borussia Dortmund (1900).

23,Olympic medal production  on track,PARIS: The French national mint said on Monday that production of the medals for the Paris Olympic Games remained on...,"PARIS: The French national mint said on Monday that production of the medals for the Paris Olympic Games remained on track despite protests and stoppages by staff since last month.
Around 50 employees demonstrated in front of the mint’s central Paris headquarters on Monday, claiming that stoppages over the last fortnight had  “blocked production” of the medals ahead of the start of the Games on July 26.
“Production of the medals is not blocked,” the mint said in a statement.
“All medals have been minted and we are at finishing stage. We will del­i­v­er on schedule and on time.”
Protesting staff, represented by trade unions, want an  “Olympics bonus” which is being paid to other state employees such as police officers and nurses who will have to work over the Olympics and Paral­ympics in July-August.
Management of the mint have refused bonuses and are negotiating annual pay rises for their 430 staff, who are responsible for producing the roughly 5,000 gold, silver and bronze medals to be used during the Games.
The Paris 2024 medals are made from recycled metal and will each contain a small hexagon-shaped medallion cut from discarded metal from the original Eiffel Tower.

24,"Athletics track for Olympics is made in Italy, in purple",Mondo claims the track delivers better performance than the one used at the Covid-delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics.,"ALBA: Italian firm Mondo will supply this summer’s Paris Olympics with a custom purple track which could be the fastest yet for athletes hunting the biggest prizes in sport.
Based in the sleepy Piedmont town of Alba which is immersed in vineyards where the grapes for the world-famous Barolo wine ripen in the sun, Mondo first made the track for the 1976 Montreal Olympics.
For Paris — its 13th Olympics — it has devised the Mondotrack EB that will host 46 of 48 athletics events of the Games at the Stade de France.
The biggest stars in athletics such as reigning women’s world 100m champion Sha’Carri Rich­ardson will strive for Olympic glory on its surface.
Mondo claim the track delivers better performance than the one used at the Covid-delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics, whe­re three world records were broken, including the men’s and women’s 400m hurdles marks set by Karsten Warholm and Sydney McLaughlin-Levr­one respectively.
“We have changed the design of the cells on the lower layer of the track compared to the one used in Tokyo,” Maurizio Stroppiana, vice-president of Mondo’s sports division, told AFP.
“That reduces the energy loss for athletes and sends it back up to them at the best possible point of their movement.”
However research and development manager Andrea Marenghi says that Mondo cannot  “do whatever we want” with the composition of the track.
“There are very strict criteria set by the IOC because the most important thing is to safeguard the health of the athlete and not impair their technique,” says Marenghi.
“Athletes are more high-performance than ever, and the track doesn’t give anything that they don’t already have.”
The Paris track will be a striking purple rather than the traditional terracotta.
Marenghi told AFP that the two new shades — one for the competition areas and another for the technical areas — will only be used for the Games in Paris.

25,French charity sounds alarm about Seine ahead of Olympics,"In an open letter, the charity said it “wanted to share with stakeholders its rising concerns about the quality of the Seine"".","PARIS: A French water charity sounded the alarm on Monday about pollution in the Seine just over 100 days before the start of the Olympics when the river is set to be used for swimming events.
Surfrider Foundation said it had analysed six months of tests over winter undertaken by a laboratory and had concluded that the river water remained polluted and potentially dangerous.
In an open letter, the Biarritz-based charity said it  “wanted to share with stakeholders its rising concerns about the quality of the Seine but also the risks faced by athletes moving in contaminated water.”
Paris authorities are in a race against time to clean up the Seine before the start of the Olympics on July 26, with the famed waterway set to play a starring role during the Games.
It is expected to host the opening ceremony, and will then be used for the marathon swimming events and the triathlon — pollution permitting.
Cleaning up the Seine has been promoted as one the key legacy achievements of the Paris 2024 Games, with mayor Anne Hidalgo intending to create three public bathing areas in the river next year.
She and President Emmanuel Macron have also promised to take a dip before the Games to demonstrate it is safe — just over a century since public swimming was banned there in 1923.
Around 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) has been spent upgrading sewage and storm water treatment facilities to reduce the amount of untreated faecal matter flowing into the river and its main tributary, the Marne.
Marc Guillaume, the top state security official for Paris, attacked Surfrider’s  “very poor knowledge of this issue”, adding:  “There’s no point doing tests today in the Seine and comparing them with what will happen next summer.”
Surfrider said the tests had been carried out by the laboratory Eau de Paris and environmental analysis group Analy-Co from September to March underneath the bridges Alexandre-III and l’Alma, where the Olympic swimming is set to take place.
European water quality standards and the international triathlon and open-water swimming federations set limits on the concentration of two bacteria — E. Coli and enterococci -- which are indicators of the presence of faecal matter.
Out of 14 rounds of testing, only one had shown  “satisfactory” results, Surfrider said.
Overall, the testing had shown  “alarming” levels often double and sometimes three times higher than the maximum permitted amounts. One reading showed E.Coli at seven times the maximum level.
Paris authorities stressed that the samples were taken over the winter period — and one of the wettest winters in 30 years.
Heavy rainfall is known to overwhelm Paris’ more than century-old sewage system, leading to direct discharges into the river of untreated effluent.
“The first quarter of 2024 saw extremely large rainfall (250 000 ml over three months, double the level of 2023) which deteriorated the quality of the water,” the Paris prefect’s office said in a statement.
Furthermore, water disinfection facilities were not working over winter and would be started ahead of the Olympics.
“There has never been question of opening the Seine for swimming all year round,” Guillaume added.
A giant new underground storm water facility is expected to be inaugurated later this month in southeast Paris, while the last sewage connections for river boats in the centre of the capital are currently being completed.
Cleaning up the Seine had been  “probably the most difficult (Olympic) project to organise,” deputy Paris mayor Emmanuel Gregoire told reporters last Friday.
Three Olympic test events in the Seine were cancelled last July and August due to elevated E. Coli readings.
The disruption was blamed on very heavy rainfall and a faulty sewer valve which led to dirty water being discharged into the river.
Last month, Brazilian swimmer Ana Marcela Cunha, the reigning Olympic open water champion, called on Paris to have a plan B in case the Seine was not ready.
Organisers say they are able to delay the swimming events in the event of heavy rainfall, but they do not intend to move them.
Olympic open-water swimming has been hit by pollution concerns in the past.
At the end of the test event in 2019 ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, swimmers protested against the quality of the water in Tokyo Bay.
At the Rio Olympics in 2016, the prospect of swimming in the polluted Guanabara Bay also made headlines.
