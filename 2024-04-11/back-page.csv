• Egyptian media claims ‘significant progress’ on contentious points; Hamas, Israeli officials insist deadlock persists
• Tel Aviv prepares military operations in Rafah; US opposes the assault
GAZA STRIP: Israel and Hamas both dampened hopes on Monday of a speedy breakthrough in Cairo talks towards a Gaza truce and hostage release deal after Egyptian state-linked media had reported “significant progress”.
As the Gaza war raged on into a seventh month, Israel is under growing international pressure to agree to a ceasefire, including from its top ally and arms supplier the United States.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted on Sunday — half a year after the October 7 attack — that Israel is “one step away from victory” and has vowed to defeat remaining Hamas fighters in Gaza’s far-southern Rafah city.
On the same day, however, the army also announced it had pulled its forces out of southern Gaza, although military commanders stressed the withdrawal was tactical and did not signal an end to the war.
Rafah operations
Israeli leaders were preparing on Monday for military operations in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah, where most of the Palestinian territory’s population has fled after six months of fighting.
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the troops would “prepare for future missions, including … in Rafah” on the Egyptian border where almost 1.5 million Gazans live in crowded shelters and tents.
Israeli government spokesman Avi Hyman said: “I wouldn’t read too much into the fact that we’ve moved soldiers in or out of anywhere. I’ll remind everyone that we’re living in a tiny country, we can move soldiers in or out very easily and very quickly.”
The United States said it still opposed a major Israeli assault on Rafah, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a date for the attack was set. “We have made clear to Israel that we think a full-scale military invasion of Rafah would have an enormously harmful effect on those civilians and that it would ultimately hurt Israel’s security,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters when asked about Netanyahu’s remarks.
“It’s not just a question of Israel presenting a plan to us. We have made clear to them that we think that there is a better way to achieve what is a legitimate goal, which is to degrade and dismantle and defeat the Hamas battalions that still remain in Rafah,” Miller said.
Witnesses said that more Israeli air strikes and artillery fire hit central Gaza, including near Gaza City and in Deir al-Balah, as well as in Rafah in the south.
Amid the threats and ongoing fighting, Netanyahu has sent negotiators to fresh truce talks that started in Cairo on Sunday, joined by US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators.
US President Joe Biden sent CIA chief Bill Burns to the talks, three days after a terse phone call with Netanyahu in which Biden demanded a halt to the fighting and greater steps to help and protect Gaza civilians.
Egypt’s state-linked news outlet Al-Qahera reported “significant progress being made on several contentious points of agreement”, citing an unnamed high-ranking Egyptian source.
The Qatari and Hamas delegations had left Cairo and were expected to return “within two days to finalise the terms of the agreement”, it said, while the US and Israeli teams were also planning 48 hours of consultations.
However, Israel’s Ynet news outlet cited an unidentified Israeli official as tempering the upbeat Egyptian report and stressing that “we still don’t see a deal on the horizon”.
“The distance is still great and there has been nothing dramatic in the meantime,” the Israeli official was quoted as saying by the Hebrew-language website.
A separate senior Israeli official was quoted by Ynet as saying that “patience is needed. There is potential, but we are not there yet.”
A Hamas official said on Monday no progress was made at a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks in Cairo. “There is no change in the position of the occupation and, therefore, there is nothing new in the Cairo talks,” the Hamas official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. “There is no progress yet.”
Another senior Hamas official told AFP that “we cannot speak of concrete progress so far”, with disagreement centred on the pace of displaced Palestinians returning to Gaza City.
Netanyahu also faced pushback from one of the far-right allies he needs to maintain a parliamentary majority and stay in power, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir.
Ben Gvir warned on X, formerly Twitter, that “if the prime minister decides to end the war without an extensive attack on Rafah in order to defeat Hamas, he will not have a mandate to continue serving as prime minister”.

2,Malaysian state turns Ramazan food waste into fertiliser,Govt initiative in central state of Pahang aims to reduce wastage.,"KUANTAN: After breaking their Ramazan fast outside a mosque in Malaysia, people throw their leftovers into a machine that converts the food scraps into organic fertiliser for crops.
The modest government initiative in the central state of Pahang aims to reduce wastage, especially during the holy month when huge amounts of food are thrown away daily.
The mobile machine has been deployed at a park in the heart of state capital Kuantan during Ramazan where many families gather every evening to feast on cheap local dishes after a day of fasting.
It processes 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of scraps a day, said Sharudin Hamid, the state director of Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Corpo­ration, which started the pilot project last year.
The amount is a tiny fraction of the more than 13,000 tonnes of food sent to landfills around the country every day, even more during Ramazan.
“The main objective is to ensure that the waste is not sent to landfills,” Sharudin said. “This has had a significant impact on us, as people are becoming more aware of environmental conservation, especially in terms of food waste reduction.”
Food scraps are thrown into the mac­h­ine where they are slowly mixed with rice husks and sawdust for 48 hours.
The brownish-coloured waste is then packaged and given to farmers to use as fertiliser on their crops.
“Things that grow from that fertiliser can also become food, which again can be composted into fertiliser. So there’s a natural cycle,” said Abdul Shukor Mohamad Salleh, 27, as he bought local delicacies at a Ramazan food market in Kuantan, one of many across the country.

3,Iran opens new consulate in Syria after deadly strike,"DAMASCUS: Iran’s foreign minister inaugurated the country’s new consulate in Damascus on Monday, a week after a...","DAMASCUS: Iran’s foreign minister inaugurated the country’s new consulate in Damascus on Monday, a week after a deadly strike blamed on Israel destroyed the former premises, sending regional tensions skyrocketing.
Tehran, a key Damascus ally, has vowed to avenge last Monday’s air strike on the Iranian embassy’s consular section that killed seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) members, including two generals.
The strike came against the backdrop of Israel and Hamas’s ongoing war in Gaza. Damascus and Tehran blame Israel for last Monday’s raid, but it has not commented.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian inaugurated the new consular section in a Damascus building in the presence of his Syrian counterpart Faisal Mekdad, whom he also met earlier on Monday, state news agency SANA said.
An AFP correspondent at the inauguration said the new consulate was not far from the premises destroyed by the strike in the upscale Mazzeh area, which also houses other foreign embassies and UN offices.
Amir-Abdollahian was also set to meet President Bashar al-Assad, and Syria’s pro-government newspaper Al-Watan said his talks in Damascus would be “mainly focused” on repercussions of last week’s strike.
The Iranian foreign minister began a regional tour on Sunday in Oman, long a mediator between Tehran and the West, where Muscat’s foreign minister called for de-escalation.
An adviser to Iran’s supreme leader warned on Sunday that Israeli embassies were “no longer safe” after the Damascus attack.
Analysts saw the raid as an escalation of Israel’s campaign against Iran and its regional proxies that runs the risk of triggering a wider war beyond the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said 16 people were killed in the consulate strike: eight Iranians, five Syrians, one member of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group and two civilians.
Among the dead were generals Mohammad Reza Zahedi and Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi, both senior commanders in the Quds Force, the IRGC’s foreign operations arm.

4,Russian FM in China to discuss ‘burning issues’,"""China is not the creator of nor a party to the Ukraine crisis,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson says.","BEIJING: Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was in China for an official visit on Monday, his ministry said, with the two countries looking to strengthen diplomatic ties as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine grinds on.
Moscow’s foreign ministry announced Lavrov had touched down in Beijing in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday morning.
He will spend two days in Beijing and meet with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, according to a previous readout from the ministry.
“An in-depth exchange of points of view is expected on a certain number of ‘burning subjects’,” the statement said, citing “the Ukrainian crisis and the situation in the Asia-Pacific region”.
The ministry added that the two men would “discuss a wide range of questions linked to bilateral cooperation, as well as cooperation on the international scene”.
Lavrov last visited Beijing in October for an international forum on Chinese President Xi Jinping’s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.
China and Russia have deepened diplomacy in recent years, using their burgeoning bonhomie as a counterweight to the US-led West.
Beijing has also become Moscow’s leading trade partner in the last two years as the latter has come under tighter Western sanctions for its invasion of its neighbour Ukraine.
Western nations regularly urge China to wield its influence over Russia to bring about peace in Ukraine, but Beijing insists it is a neutral party.
“China is not the creator of nor a party to the Ukraine crisis, and we have not and will not do anything to seek profit from it,” foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular news conference on Monday.
Beijing would “continue to promote peace talks in our own way (and) maintain communication with relevant parties including Russia and Ukraine”, she said.

5,97 killed in Mozambique makeshift ferry disaster,Most passengers were escaping mainland country due to panic caused by cholera misinformation.,"MAPUTO: Rescuers searched off the northern coast of Mozambique on Monday after a makeshift ferry boat carrying people fleeing a cholera outbreak capsized, killing at least 97.
The converted fishing boat, with about 130 people on board, ran into trouble late on Sunday as it headed for an island off Nampula province, officials said.
Most of those on board were trying to escape the mainland after misinformation about cholera caused a panic, according to Nampula’s secretary of state Jaime Neto. Many children were among the victims, he added.
On Sunday, authorities said the boat was believed to have sunk as it was overcrowded and unsuited to carrying passengers.

Most passengers were escaping mainland country due to panic caused by cholera misinformation

It was later clarified that the vessel capsized after taking on water.
“Water filled the boat… and the tragedy happened,” Menque Amade, a crew member who survived the accident, told national broadcaster TVM.
Silverio Nauaito, the island’s administrator, told AFP that six bodies were pulled from the waters on Monday, bringing the death toll to 97.
Rescuers have found 12 survivors and search operations are continuing, the official said.
The southern African country, one of the world’s poorest, has recorded almost 15,000 cases of cholera and 32 deaths since October, according to government data.
Nampula is the worst affected region, accounting for a third of all cases.
Locals told AFP that health authorities recently stepped up outreach and prevention efforts.
But the increased medical presence caused a scare among some residents, pushing a number of them to flee, they said.
In recent months, the province has also received a large influx of people fleeing a wave of jihadist attacks in its northern neighbour of Cabo Delgado.
Some of those on board were planning to go and stay with family on the island.
“They were running away from the cholera outbreak. They got into the boat, the sea was rough, the boat capsized and it killed a lot of people,” Abdul Chemuna, a relative of three of those who died in the accident, told national television.
Missing at sea
The boat was headed to the Island of Mozambique, a small coral islet that used to serve as the capital of Portuguese East Africa and gave its name to the country.
Nauaito said it was not clear how many people were missing at sea as authorities were yet to determine the exact number of passengers.
Television footage showed locals gathered around the red and green wooden boat, which had been pulled onto a beach.
Some looked out at the windy sea. Others stood next to bodies lying on the ground covered by blankets.
A trading-post on the route to India, initially used by Arab merchants, the Island of Mozambique was claimed for Portugal by famed explorer Vasco da Gama.
Hosting a fortified city and linked to the mainland by a bridge built in the 1960s, the island is listed as a World Heritage Site by the UN’s culture agency, UNESCO.
Mozambique, which has a long Indian Ocean coastline, was a Portuguese colony until independence in 1975.
Home to more than 30 million people, it is regularly hit by destructive cyclones.
In March, at least one person died as an illegal fishing vessel foundered near a southern beach.
With almost two-thirds of the population living in poverty, Mozambique has set high hopes on vast natural gas deposits discovered in Cabo Delgado in 2010.
But an insurgency since 2017 waged by militants linked to the Islamic State group has stalled progress.
More than 5,000 people have been killed and almost a million forced to flee their homes since fighting began.
