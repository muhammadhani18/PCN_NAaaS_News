He said the business community could make contact with the chamber to take advantage of these research study reports.
The SCCI president unveiled the report prepared by the chamber’s research and development cell regarding natural resources of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and potential in agriculture and fishery sectors during an Iftar-dinner hosted in honour of executive members of SCCI here.
The Iftar-dinner was attended by SCCI’s senior vice-presidents Sanaullah, Ejaz Afridi, former presidents Hasnain Khurshid, Riaz Arshad, Zahid Shinwari, Adeel Rauf, Faiz Mohammad, Sherbaz Bilour, former vice-presidents and SCCI executive members.
Fuad Ishaq said that SCCI planned to organise a business conference with the theme – traders and industrialists are builders of the nation – in the second week of May.
He said that political leaders, government officials from relevant institutions and representatives of stakeholders would be invited to the conference.
Mr Ishaq said that a joint economic roadmap would be designed during this important moot. “Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is blessed with abundant natural resources like oil, gas and hydel electricity. However, despite that the province is lagging behind as compared to the other federating units in the journey of progress,” Mr Ishaq deplored.
The SCCI president said that traders and industrialists were in trouble in the prevailing circumstances, while jobs were not available to the talented and highly-qualified youth. He said economic growth and prosperity would only come with flourishing business, industry and trade.
The chamber president urged the relevant authorities to take pragmatic steps to mitigate hardships of the business community because when traders and industrialists would be prosperous then business and trade could be enhanced, leading to generation of employment opportunities in the province.

“Air ambulance service should be launched to make sure that people in remote and inaccessible areas reach hospitals on time,” he told a meeting here.
The meeting was also attended by health minister Syed Qasim Ali Shah, health secretary Mahmood Aslam Wazir and Sehat Card Plus CEO Dr Mohammad Riaz Tanoli, according to an official statement.

He also says matters about Sehat Card Plus programme should be made more transparent

The chief minister said that the provincial government would provide the required funds for the initiative as it was the need of the time to provide prompt healthcare to the people in the event of emergencies to protect their lives.
He also ordered the launch of a motorcycle response unit to help transport patients to hospitals in emergencies from congested areas.
Mr Gandapur said the Executive Health Checkup programme should be launched in hospitals to enable people over 65 years of age to undergo free checkups every three months.
Officials told the CM that 52,542 patients received Rs1.314 billion free treatment under the SCP programme since March 12.
They also said that artificial intelligence was being used to make services under the SCP more transparent and use taxpayers’ money to benefit the people.
The officials said that a mobile app was being prepared through which the names of family heads and other members would be available to all people.
They said the government was making full use of modern technology to make the initiative more transparent and people-friendly.
The officials said a “system of open kutcheris” had been launched to let people ask questions about the SCP programme and lodge complaints.
They added that during those events, most of the complaints were resolved on the spot.
The officials said there was also another mechanism of feedback through Nadra’s system, where 98.5 per cent of the people were found to be satisfied with the health insurance programme.
On the occasion, CEO of the SCP Dr Riaz Tanoli said the health insurance programme benefitted all residents of the province.
He said all people with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s computerised national identity cards could seek treatment not only in the province’s hospitals but in those in other provinces as well.
“There is a laid down criteria for the selection of hospitals, where the people can seek quality services on the production of the Sehat Cards,” he said.
Dr Tanoli said no compromise was made on the quality of services.
He said more hospitals with modern infrastructure and staff would be empanelled for the programme.
“We have suspended empanellment of many hospitals after finding complaints against them true,” he said.

4,PHC seeks KP Assembly speaker’s reply over plea of members elected on reserved seats,Court clubs instant plea with three other petitions over oath issue.,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court on Tuesday sought reply within a fortnight from speaker of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly to plea of some opposition members elected on seats reserved for women and non-Muslims seeking implementation of the court’s order directing him (speaker) to take oath from them.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Fazal Subhan issued the order after preliminary hearing of a petition jointly filed by eight of the MPAs notified by Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on reserved seats including Ms Mehr Sultana, Behari Lal, Suresh Kumar, etc.
The bench also directed to club the instant plea with three other petitions filed by some other opposition members on reserved seats including Shazia Tehmas Khan, Aiman Jalil Jan, etc.
The petitioners have stated that despite clear directives of the court to the speaker to take oath from them prior to the April 2 Senate polls, he did not administer oath to them.

Court clubs instant plea with three other petitions over oath issue

They have requested the court to issue order to the KP Assembly speaker for implementation of its order.
Barrister Saqib Raza appeared for the petitioners and stated that the petitioners and several other MPAs, who were notified as MPAs on reserved seats, had filed petitions seeking declaration of the court that the non-administration of oath to them was illegal and unconstitutional.
He stated that the petitioners had further requested the court to direct the respondents including the speaker and the deputy speaker of the assembly to administer oath to them so as to enable them to participate and cast their votes in the April 2 Senate election.
He contended that the high court had accepted the said petitions on March 27 and had directed the speaker to administer oath to the petitioners and also to allow and facilitate them in casting their votes in the Senate election.
He stated that not only the counsel for the respondents (speaker and deputy speaker) was present rather the order was pronounced in open court.
He stated that till date no oath taking had been arranged, thus openly defying the court’s order.
He stated that the respondents had been dragging their feet on the matter.
He argued that the speaker should have done necessary correspondence for requisitioning of the session of the assembly and including administering oath to the MPAs as agenda item No. 1 by April 2 but no process for oath taking had been arranged, thus openly defying the time-bound order of the high court.
It is pertinent to mention that on April 3, a bench of the high court had sought response of the speaker and deputy speaker to a contempt petition filed by four of the MPAs-elect seeking to initiate contempt proceedings against the speaker and the deputy speaker for not implementing the court order of taking oath from them.
Those petitioners have also requested the court to order disqualification of Speaker Babar Saleem Swati and Deputy Speaker Suriya Bibi from holding any public office as they had willfully flouted the March 27 order of the high court.
The speaker has also filed a review petition in the high court, requesting it to recall its order of March 27.
The speaker has stated that administering oath to the members was only possible when assembly session was summoned or requisitioned as per the mandate of Article 65 of the Constitution. He added that the speaker couldn’t summon a session on his own unless requisition was filed by one-fourth of the members of the assembly.

6,Artists’ community termed true ambassador of pluralistic society,ANP vows to stand with artists through thick and thin,"PESHAWAR: Speakers at an event held at Bacha Khan Markaz here the other day termed artists’ community true representative of a pluralistic and just society and their services should be recognised duly.
Unfortunately, artists and musicians didn’t get due status in our society and therefore their financial position remained pathetic due to lack of cultural activities, they said.
A free Eid food packages distribution ceremony was arranged under the auspices of Bacha Khan Patient’s Welfare Organisation (BKPWO) and Malgari Doctoran at Bacha Khan Markaz here.
Over 100 deserving artists, musicians and their families were given free Eid food packages comprising 10kg flour, 5kg sugar, one kg beans, a packet of spices and vermicelli for the upcoming Eid festival.

ANP vows to stand with artists through thick and thin

Roman Gul, an Afghan folk artist, told Dawn that he and his several colleagues couldn’t earn enough to support their families while Meena Arshad, a local female artist, remarked had the doors of Nishtar Hall opened on them, they could earn a decent livelihood.
Mian Iftikhar Hussain, general secretary of Awami National Party, on the occasion pointed out that the role of artists and musicians in promoting human values in the society was evident and their status should be upheld at all costs. Artists were ambassadors of peace, and goodwill in a pluralistic and just society, he added.
Mr Hussain stated that the doors of Nishtar Hall were open in his tenure to all kinds of literary and cultural activities while deserving artists and performers were helped out against the threat of militants, but, unfortunately, today artist’s community was forced to live in penury.
He regretted that artists and musicians were being degraded rather threatened for their contribution to the society and they never got their due status, while in other societies, artists ran charity projects. In our country artists were being forced to beg, he added.
My party would always stand by the artist’s community through thick and thin, assured the ANP leader.
Rashid Ahmad Khan, director of Angaze Music Production and chief of Artist’s Welfare Society (AWS), on behalf of Bacha Khan Markaz announced that folk singers and artists would be provided an opportunity to record their music pieces free of cost.

A young customer tries a cap at a shop in Landi Kotal Bazaar. — Dawn

 
KHYBER: The Landi Kotal Bazaar has reported high sales of traditional caps, which are worn by residents with Eid clothes.
Sellers offer a variety of caps with varying prices to customers, mostly youth and children, while elders prefer those with modest designs.
Iqbal Khan, a cap seller in Landi Kotal Bazaar, told Dawn that his sales had multiplied as Eidul Fitr drew closer.
“Parents and children consider their Eid preparations incomplete without new caps,” he said.
He said he sold caps from Bangladesh, China, Karachi, Dir, Charsadda, and Peshawar, but the youth preferred white ones from Charsadda and Peshawar.
“People mostly buy colourful caps for their children aged below 15,” he said.
The shopkeeper said handmade white caps from Dir were mostly liked by tribesmen over the age of 40.
He said handmade caps cost more than others.
“Bangladeshi, Chinese and Peshawari caps liked by youth because they’re lightweight, mostly machine-made, and have affordable prices,” he said.
Javed Khan, 24, said he inherited the cap business from his father, who migrated to Landi Kotal from Bajaur in 2002.
“My business picks up momentum days ahead of Eidul Fitr and Eidul Azha. In other months, it is business as usual for me,” he said.
The shopkeeper said the caps made in Wahid Garhi and Bakhshu Pul areas of Peshawar had become popular with the youth due to their light weight and fine finishing.
“Wearing a cap is our tradition. Any festive occasion is considered incomplete without the addition of a new cap to the youth’s wardrobe,” he said.
Mr Javed, however, regretted that the demand for traditional handmade white caps from Dir was gradually declining due to the “influx” of both imported and lightweight caps with colour and design variations.
People in Jamrud and Bara areas of Khyber tribal district said the demand for caps in the two tehsils was not as high as it was in Landi Kotal.
They said the tradition of wearing caps was fast fading away, with only the elderly strictly following it.
During its ‘occupation’ of Bara tehsil from 2005 to 2011, a local militant organisation, Lashkar-i-Islam, had made it mandatory for men to wear caps. However, the restriction eased after the 2012 elimination of the outfit in a military operation.
Turab Ali, a social activist, insisted that as tribal traditions were fast losing their appeal for local youth, they mostly wore caps or lungi to weddings and cultural events only.
Sajid Ali Kukikhel of Jamrud said tribal youth were more influenced by new fashion trends, while some among them insisted that caps “ruined” their hairstyles.
“Now, caps are mostly worn by youngsters for offering prayers. However, elders put on caps as a tradition,” he said.

Another resident, Abdul Razzaq, said Tanawal lacked basic facilities and development. “People of the erstwhile Amb and Pulrah states have been peacefully advocating the cause of Tanawal district for along time. The government should notify Tanawal as a separate district,” he said.
Mr Razzaq said the residents of Tanawal were still widely deprived of their basic amenities and development. “If the government is sincere about our development, it should declare Tanawal a district,” he said.
HELD: The police have claimed to have arrested around 100 drug peddlers and seized a large cache of narcotics across Mansehra district last week.
“We launched a crackdown on narcotics earlier this month and have so far arrested around 100 drug pushers and seized around 120kg of charas, 6kg of ice drug and 2kg of heroin,” DPO Shafeeullah Gandapur told reporters here on Tuesday.

18,Outgoing PHC chief says paid ‘heavy price’ for recent judgements,Full-court reference held for CJ Ibrahim Khan.,"PESHAWAR: Outgoing Peshawar High Court Chief Justice Ibrahim Khan said Monday he had paid a heavy price for his recent judgements.
During a full-court reference for him at the high court ahead of his retirement on April 14, Justice Ibrahim said that in the recent political turmoil, the PHC received thousands of petitions from outside the limits of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which were decided “virtuously within the four corners of law.”
“I have no affiliation whatsoever with any political party or figure, but unfortunately, one political party had preferred these petitions [to be filed with our high court]. Though I have paid a heavy price for my recent verdicts, I am overwhelmed to proclaim that as the chief justice of KP, I ensured the rule of law at the cost of my career progression,” he said.
 
 

The CJ said since his elevation to the high court, he had passed around 15,000 judgements and of them, 509 were challenged in the Supreme Court.

Full-court reference held for CJ

He added that the apex court upheld verdicts in 279 of those cases and set aside only 42 of small nature, while 188 were still sub judice.
Justice Ibrahim said in his 31-year-long judicial career, he performed his duties to the best of his conscious, within the legal premise, and without any fear or favour.
“I was assigned the most arduous task of my entire service when appointed to the commission to probe the heart-wrenching incident of the Army Public School massacre, notwithstanding that I was on the 10th position on the seniority list of the high court,” he said.
The CJ said it was a formidable challenge, and he, along with his team, burned midnight oil to formulate an all-encompassing report covering every question raised before it.
He said the commission interacted with the parents of martyrs, senior army generals, bureaucrats, and officers of law-enforcement agencies.
“I have already submitted an extensive report to the chief justice of Pakistan, but my memories attached to this commission are unforgettable,” he said.
Justice Ibrahim said his paramount emphasis throughout his judicial service remained the amicable settlement of disputes, and he was proud to announce that he had decided a record number of family cases in particular through that mode.
He said his efforts brought together thousands of families with extremely strained relations.
“Besides, I have also compromised in thousands of other civil and criminal matters, and this fact is on record. Similarly, record human rights applications were received, proceeded with, and decided fruitfully during my tenure,” he said.
The CJ said throughout his service, he strived to embody the virtues of integrity, impartiality, and a steadfast commitment to justice, principles he believed would naturally pave the way for recognition and career advancement based on merit.
“To my successors and my brother Judge Ishtiaq Ibrahim, I offer my heartfelt blessings, best wishes, and humble prayers. May you carry the torch of justice with pride, integrity, and compassion, and may you always remember that behind every case file lies a human story—a story that deserves to be heard, understood, and respected,” he said.
Peshawar High Court Bar Association president Tariq Afridi, advocate general Shah Faisal Utmankhel, and additional attorney general Sanaullah paid tribute to Justice Ibrahim for his services to the judiciary.
Justice Ibrahim joined the Peshawar High Court as the additional judge on August 11, 2016. He was made a permanent judge of the PHC on June 1, 2018, and the acting chief justice of the PHC on July 7, 2023. He was made the high court’s chief justice on August 25, 2023.

On December 22, PHC Chief Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan ordered TI to furnish evidence regarding its report wherein judiciary was declared the second most corrupt institution of the province.
“Your organisation should withdraw this report if you do not have proof to substantiate this claim,” Justice Khan had observed last year and had asked TI board members to furnish evidence of any corruption in the high court.
During the hearing of the case on Monday, PHC ordered TIP that the revised report should be published and circulated in the manner and form of NCPS 2023.
The court sought explanation from TI about missing data regarding 788 responses and asked it to show the exact number of rejected forms as to how many were rejected in the case of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“After accurate number of forms are ascertained, accurate percentage shall be provided,” the court ordered.
PHC also ordered the TI board to explain and include the 87%, 85% and 57% claims in the revised NCPS 2023 report for readers. The court observed that TI must not leave key findings buried in the data to be discovered by lay readers from reading between the lines.
Justice Ibrahim ordered TI to set out clearly the inherent limitation of perception survey in the revised NCPS 2023 and the explanation provided in its response of January 15, 2024, should be included in the revised report.
The court observed that it was disappointing that TI did not show willingness to correct the report on its own. 
Had TI showed willingness to revise and rectify the report, there would have been no need for order of the court, it added.
Justice Khan observed that it was made clear that the aim of the judgment was not to limit the freedom of expression or objective and credible research and was rather meant to encourage reliable, valid and credible research that would assist the institutions and serve public interest.

22,DHOs complain about shortage of essential medicines in KP,Ask dept for supplies cleared by testing lab to prevent audit objections.,"PESHAWAR: District health officers in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province have complained about the shortage of essential drugs and asked the health department for supplies cleared by the drug testing laboratory to cater for patients and prevent objections by the audit department.
Official documents available with Dawn reveal that around 40 medicines purchased by the province’s directorate-general (health services) were found to be “substandard, misbranded, or both” during examination at the DTL in the last three months.
In a letter to the directorate on April 6, the DHO of Kohat district highlighted the “critical shortage of essential medicines” at the health facilities supervised by him.
“Unfortunately, we have not yet received the ‘top-up’ medicines requested to address their acute shortage. With Eid holidays only two days away, this lack of supplies poses a significant challenge,” he said.

Ask dept for supplies cleared by testing lab to prevent audit objections

The DHO said the medicine distribution required the DTL’s clearance to avoid audit objections.
“Without it, supplies might not be made, as I (DHO) am already facing the advanced audit paragraph from last year because of the DTL clearance prior to the distribution of medications,” it said.
The official sought the directorate’s immediate intervention to ensure uninterrupted patient care at Kohat’s public sector health centres during Eid days and beyond.
“We require a swift and effective arrangement to guarantee the availability of essential medicines at our facilities, which are already facing severe shortages,” he said.
Sources in the health department told Dawn that in the last four months, 38 drugs as well as disposable items were found to be either substandard, misbranded, or both, which should have been cleared by the DTL prior to their procurement.
They added that most drug manufacturers or suppliers were locals, while in some cases, the suppliers had given “misbranded” goods to the health department, which bought them for all government hospitals in the province.
“The government claims to have made enough supplies to the hospitals recently, but a report by the Independent Monitoring Board has pointed out a shortage of essential medicines in most hospitals,” an official insisted.
He added that those drugs were procured from the firms, most of which didn’t meet criteria, due to “poor inspection” by authorities.
“More than 50 per cent of the firms have been paid by the health department despite testing the failure of their items at the DTL. Only last week, the department purchased Rs4 billion medicines and other goods, but the DHOs have yet to receive them, much to the misery of patients, especially those with injuries or in critical condition,” he said.
The official said most recently, the DTL detected “particles” in a commonly used injection supplied by a Lahore-based company.
A DHO told Dawn on condition of anonymity, that he was afraid of accepting drugs without their clearance by the DTL, as such an act could be objected to by the audit department and could even lead to action by the National Accountability Bureau.
“I, like other DHOs, want all medicines, surgical items, and chemicals to be tested and cleared by the DTL before dispatch to hospitals,” he said.
When contacted, DG (health) Dr Shaukat Ali claimed that no drug purchased by the department had been tested substandard or misbranded.
“We are in the process of medicine procurement for and supply to the district hospitals. This exercise will be completed by May 15. All drugs will be cleared by the DTL,” he said.
Dr Ali said if any medicine failed the DTL testing, its supplier wouldn’t be paid.
He said the shortage of drugs was caused by the non-release of government funds in the last two years.
“Now, the process of medicine procurement is in progress,” he said, adding that the DHOs were purchasing drugs on their own to address shortages.

29,People throng markets to lay hand on popular Charsadda Chappal,Cobblers seek govt support to export the footwear,"

CHARSADDA: People from across Khyber Pakhunkhwa and rest of the country are thronging the Chappal Bazaar here to lay their hands on their favourite footwear – Charsadda Chappal – ahead of Eidul Fitr. 
The footwear is not only famous in Pakistan but also in the Gulf States. 
According to official data available with Dawn, the chappal is made at around 800 small units in Charsadda, and according to a conservative estimate, 8,000 pairs of this traditional footwear are produced daily. 
According to people connected with this business, chappal-making has become an industry in Charsadda. 
They said prominent artisans like Hassan Gul Ustad, Mama Ustad, Tehmash, Shehzad Mir and many others introduced a variety of new designs that are in tune with the modern demands and fashion. 

Cobblers seek govt support to export the footwear

They said now traditional Charsadda Chappal was sent as gift to Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia, UAE etc.  
Some seven years ago, Saudi Arabia was sent a container full of Charsadda Chappal, which was well received in the market there, but due to lack of government support this practice could not be continued, they regretted. 
The traditional footwear available from Rs1,000 to Rs1,500 in these shops is sold from Rs3,000 to Rs5,000 in showrooms in other parts of the country, these people said.  
The people associated with the chappal making said high value leather was used in the footwear to maintain its brightness and durability. 
Though the local craftsmen have made extraordinary efforts and continued to revive the footwear industry no effort has been made at the government level to help them in flourishing this industry. 
Keeping in view the skills and expertise of these cobblers, the Export Promotion Bureau had decided to establish a footwear training institute some 15 years ago, and for this purpose about 32 kanals of land had also been purchased, but the building of the institute has not yet been constructed. 
However, since 2003, the EPB and Charsadda Chappal Makers Association have continued the training process in a rented house, imparting skills to thousands of youth and hundreds of women till now. Now these people are engaged in shoemaking in various factories in other cities, including Karachi and Lahore, the people associated with the business said. 
According to them about 8,000 people are directly involved in shoemaking, including a significant number of women. These women while sitting in their homes engage in sole sewing and slipper making, becoming an invisible economic force to earn for their families. 
These people said prices of raw material were skyrocketing. They said though most of the leather was produced in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Afghanistan its tanneries were in Punjab, incurring huge costs on its transportation. They said if these factories were set up in KP then not only raw material would be available cheaply and easily but thousands of people would also get employment. 
These people said if the provincial government constructed footwear making units on the vacant plot of 32 kanals, then the region would become an industrial hub like Sialkot, and not only slippers but other leather products like jackets, racquets, thread and handbags would be manufactured, guaranteeing economic uplift of people. 
They said there was a need to provide resources and opportunities to chappal makers to participate in exhibitions organised in the country and abroad, thus creating a new revenue-earning channel.
