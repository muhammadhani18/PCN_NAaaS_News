The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) achieved a remarkable milestone during the outgoing holy month, as it usually sees low volume and lacklustre activities in Ramazan. However, this year, the month proved to be different due to political stability post-election and other developments, tossing the market to new peaks in the last session before Eid holidays.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the equity market settled at a record amid upbeat remittances data rising year-on-year by 16.4pc to $2.95bn in March and affirmation of a $5bn investment package from Saudi Arabia for economic support.
Last year, Saudi Arabia promised to invest $25 billion within the next five years under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), which is seeking investments in the energy, IT, minerals, defence and agriculture sectors from the Arab countries.
The $5bn investment is expected to be made in the minerals sector, especially the Reko Diq gold and copper mines. Saudi Arabia has already been studying the prospects of tapping into this sector, though the kingdom also has interests in petroleum, agriculture, and IT sectors.
Mr Mehanti said the rising global crude oil prices and renewed hopes for support from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to settle Pakistan’s external financing needs of over $25bn in the next fiscal year also fuelled the bullish sentiments.
He said speculations ahead of new IMF loan programme talks due next week and expectations of a cut in the SBP policy rate amid falling inflation triggered value-hunting across the board.
Topline Securities Ltd Chief Executive Officer Muhammad Suhail said the benchmark KSE 100 index has surged by an astounding 70pc over the past nine months (equivalent to a 75pc increase in US dollar terms) from end June, marking a historic rally not witnessed in the PSX for the past two decades. 
Despite this rally, the average market price to earnings (PE) ratio is 4x, half the historical average of 8x, he added.
Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank Ltd, Hub Power Company Ltd, Mari Petroleum Ltd and Engro Fertilisers contributed 471 points to the index. 
As a result, the benchmark KSE 100-share index surged to an intraday record of 70,677.30, gaining 1,057.31 points. However, it closed at 70,314.72 points after adding 694.73 points, or 1pc from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume rose 15.95pc to 389.39 million shares. The traded value also increased by 12.78pc to Rs17.31bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom Ltd (34.37m shares), Pakistan International Bulk Terminal (27.81m shares), Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (19.03m shares), Fauji Foods Ltd (13.01m shares) and Agritech Ltd (12.73m shares).
The companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs100.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs55.85), Premium Textile Mills Ltd (Rs24.00), Abbott Laboratories Ltd (Rs21.67) and Millat Tractors Ltd (Rs14.75).
The shares registering the most significant decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Sapphire Textile Mills Ltd (Rs60.00), Bata Pakistan (Rs50.00), Shahmurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs30.31), Pakistan Hotels Developers Ltd (Rs15.53) and Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs11.67).
Foreign investors remained net buyers as they bought shares worth $2.47m.

1,Rupee holds steady ahead of holidays,Some analysts still fear any shock can destabilise exchange rate within days.,"KARACHI: In the lead-up to the Eid holiday break, the rupee displayed resilience, staying steady against the US dollar in Tuesday’s interbank trading.
According to the State Bank, the dollar closed at Rs277.94 on Tuesday compared to Rs277.95 the previous day.
Over the past three months, the rupee has appreciated by around Rs3 against the dollar, signalling a period of stability and incremental growth in the local currency’s performance.
While this exchange rate stability did not directly spur foreign direct investment, March witnessed a significant uptick in domestic bond inflows.
The SBP’s data reveals an inflow of $89 million into treasury bills during March, the highest monthly inflow during the current fiscal year. The figure also outpaced equity inflows, which stood at $26.4m, even as the stock market experienced notable volumes.

Some analysts still fear any shock can destabilise exchange rate within days 

Currency experts say the current boom in the equity market is mainly due to stability in the exchange rate, but the treasury bills proved more attractive for foreign investors.
The gradual appreciation of the rupee against the dollar supported the exchange rate, but exporters were perturbed by this situation. Some bankers say the rupee may appreciate more rapidly if the local currency sets it free, but the government and the State Bank are trying to manage the exchange rate in favour of exporters.
Exporters express concern over the potential for decreased earnings due to the dollar’s devaluation, with forward booking premiums dropping significantly.
The State Bank’s latest report shows its foreign exchange reserves at slightly above $8bn, which is insufficient to keep the exchange rate stable amid continuous debt servicing payments.
The outflows for debt servicing eat up over 85 per cent of the remittances coming into the country. The remittances are higher than export proceeds and play a key role in curbing the current account deficit.
Facing increasing debt repayment obligations, which are undermining the nation’s financial stability, Pakistan requires an ambitious $25 billion for the next fiscal year (2024-25) to manage its external account effectively. This necessitates a strategy focused on equating exports with imports to mitigate the trade deficit.
However, the current government approach largely mirrors past tactics, relying on seeking new loans from the IMF, soliciting additional support, aid and grants from friendly nations, and negotiating loan rollovers with key partners like Saudi Arabia, UAE and China.
“There is no hope for a strong future of the local currency. Any shock could destabilise the exchange rate within days,” a currency dealer said.

2,Pakistan’s exports to central Asian states jump 21pc in 8 months,"Despite existing prospects, bilateral trade volume yet to attain full potential.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s exports to five central Asian countries (CACs) witnessed a growth of 21.17 per cent during the first eight months of the current fiscal year over the corresponding period last year.
Despite the existing prospects, the country’s exports to the region have yet to attain their full potential. Similarly, imports from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and other countries to Pakistan have not increased significantly, despite regular high-profile visits.
In absolute terms, the value of Pakistan’s exports to the five central Asian countries — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — rose by 21.17pc to $158.07 million in July-February 2024 from $130.45m during the same period last year.
Imports from the region fell by 18.56pc to $17.46m in 8MFY24 from $21.44m during the same period last year. The majority of these imports came from Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.

Despite existing prospects, bilateral trade volume yet to attain full potential

Pakistan’s trade with CACs is between $400 and $500m annually via transit of Afghanistan. Uzbekistan has already implemented its transit trade agreement with Pakistan, under which 1,200 containers were imported in February.
Tajikistan imported three trucks loaded with potatoes from Pakistan under the transit agreement.
Pakistan’s exports to Turkmenistan stood at $0.735m in 8MFY24 from $0.79m over the corresponding months last year, showing a decline of 6.33pc. Imports from Turkmenistan recorded a growth of 113pc to $4.96m during the period under review against $2.32m over the corresponding months last year.
The export proceeds to Uzbekistan reached $47.07m in 8MFY24 against $53.22m over the corresponding months last year, showing a decline of 11.55pc. Imports from Uzbekistan also declined by 19.87pc to $9.11m from $11.37m over the corresponding months last year.
In terms of value, Kazakhstan has the highest export value, with $90.76m in 8MFY24 compared to $59.55m during the same period last year, representing a 52.40pc rise. The value of imports from Kazakhstan fell 85.74pc to $0.62m this year against $4.35m over the corresponding months of last year.
Pakistan’s exports to Kyrgyzstan stood at $6.37m in 8MFY24 against $2.78m over the corresponding months last year, indicating an increase of 129pc. Imports from Kyrgyzstan stood at $0.27m this year as against $0.14m over the last year, a decline of over 92pc.
Exports to Tajikistan stood at $13.14m in 8MFY24 against $14.11m over corresponding months last year, showing a decline of 6.87pc. Similarly, imports from Tajikistan also dropped 23.3pc to $2.50 against $3.26m over the corresponding months last year.
Pakistan and Tajikistan have already signed and implemented a transit trade agreement. Under the agreement, Tajikistan will import goods via Pakistani seaports.

3,International Finance Corporation approves $400m for PTCL to buy Telenor,Financing agreements with IFC will be completed by July 31.,"ISLAMABAD: The International Finance Corporation (IFC) board has approved $400 million in financing for PTCL Group’s purchase of Telenor Pakistan.
The decision follows Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd’s (PTCL) signing of a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Telenor Pakistan to acquire a 100 per cent stake in the company on a cash-free, debt-free basis.
As the takeover of Telenor Pakistan by the PTCL is in progress, the financing agreements with IFC will be completed by July 31.
While the UAE-owned company e&, formerly Etisalat, had management control of the PTCL, sources in the PTCL revealed that the IFC would provide the financing to the Government of Pakistan, which is still the largest shareholder of the PTCL.
PTCL’s management is with ‘e&’, which has 26pc of the shares. The largest shareholding of 62pc is with the Government of Pakistan and the remaining 12pc has been floated through the PSX.
However, the financing details will be made public when the loan will be materialised in July.
Since PTCL was a listed company, the IFC decision was also informed to the Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited (PSX) under the rules.
The PTCL has informed the PSX that in December 2023, after approval by the PTCL board of directors, the company entered into an SPA with the shareholders of Telenor Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd for the acquisition of its 100pc shares in Pakistan at Rs108bn on a cash-free and debt-free basis.
PTCL had approached the IFC for financing to materialise the deal.
The acquisition of Telenor Pakistan by PTCL Group is subject to necessary regulatory approvals, including the formal clearance by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP).
Currently, there are four players in the telecom sector led by Jazz, Telenor, Zong and Ufone, while Ufone is a subsidiary of the PTCL; after the intended acquisition of Telenor Pakistan, both Ufone and Telenor will be merged to become equally as large as Jazz.
The competitors have raised concerns to the CCP over the acquisition of Telenor Pakistan by the PTCL.
The acquisition of Telenor by the PTCL will be one of the largest mergers in Pakistan’s telecom sector, as the joint company of Ufoneand Telenor Pakistan will bring their subscriber base close to that of Jazz, the largest telecom in the country.

4,Oil prices ease amid deadlock in Gaza truce talks,Brent crude futures fell 91 cents to $89.7 per barrel by 12:50pm ET; US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down $1.12 at $85.29.,"HOUSTON: Oil prices dipped for a second day on Tuesday, as talks for a ceasefire in Gaza continued, but losses were limited to less than a dollar a barrel as Egyptian and Qatari mediators met resistance in their search to find a way out of the war.
The talks in Cairo, also attended by the director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency William Burns, have so far failed to reach a breakthrough.
Hamas said an Israeli proposal on a ceasefire met none of the demands of Palestinian militant factions, but it would study the offer further and deliver its response to mediators.
Brent crude futures fell 91 cents, or 1 per cent, to $89.7 per barrel by 12:50pm ET (1650 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down $1.12 cents or 1.3% at $85.29.
On Monday, Brent posted its first decline in five sessions and WTI its first in seven as a fresh round of Israel-Hamas ceasefire discussions in Cairo raised hopes of a breakthrough.
“Without an end to the conflict, there is an elevated risk that other countries, particularly Iran, Opec’s third-largest producer, could be drawn into the war,” said Fiona Cincotta, Senior Financial Market Analyst at City Index.
The commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard’s navy said it could close the Strait of Hormuz if deemed necessary. About a fifth of the volume of the world’s total oil consumption passes through the strait daily.
Turkiye announced it would restrict exports of various products, inclu­ding jet fuel, to Israel until there is a ceasefire. Israel said it would respond with its own curbs.

6,OICCI seeks steps for ease of doing business,OICCI members contribute about one-third of the country’s tax revenue and are also the largest investors in Pakistan.,"LAHORE: Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has emphasised the need for significant progress towards Ease of Doing Business measures, especially in taxation and regulatory compliance.
“There is also a need to critically examine the need for a large number of regulatory bodies, in line with other similar economies as Pakistan appears to be an over-regulated economy, which discourages initiative and investment by local and foreign investors,” the chamber said on Tuesday in a letter to Federal Minister for Ministry of Privatisation and Board of Investment and Communication Abdul Aleem Khan.
OICCI is the collective body of Pakistan’s top 200 foreign investors from 30 countries, said the letter. 
OICCI members contribute about one-third of the country’s tax revenue and are also the largest investors in Pakistan. In the last ten years, they have invested about $22 billion to expand their footprint in the country and transfer technical and managerial best practices.
“We offer valuable global insights to benefit Pakistan’s investment ecosystem. Once finalised, the results of the OICCI and McKinsey reports for a few selected sectors will be duly shared with the government of Pakistan,” it said.

7,SBP develops payment framework for BISP beneficiaries,"About 9.3 million BISP beneficiaries can open a ""BISP Sahulat Account"" in a single visit to designated bank branch.","KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has developed a framework to onboard the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) beneficiaries for receiving social welfare payments into their accounts to be opened in all banks and microfinance banks.
The SBP said the framework has been developed in consultation with the BISP and banks.
Under the framework, about 9.3 million BISP beneficiaries can open a “BISP Sahulat Account” in a single visit to the designated bank branch within their vicinity. The BISP has mapped its beneficiaries with a bank branch near them.
However, given the large number of beneficiaries, the framework will be implemented in phases. Initially, a pilot phase will be run in Karachi and Lahore to, onboarding about 300,000 BISP beneficiaries. After the pilot phase is successful, the framework coverage will be extended to other cities in consultation with BISP, said the SBP.
The SBP said, “The framework is expected to facilitate the efficient and transparent disbursement of social welfare payments to BISP beneficiaries, enhance women’s financial inclusion, and promote the digitisation of financial services.”
The BISP was widely criticised for gross misuse of funds, but the government finds it helpful for people who are unable to pay their day-to-day expenses. The latest move is apparently to plug the leakages and pilferages of the funds.
To enable the BISP’s beneficiaries to receive their financial assistance directly into their bank accounts, the SBP has asked banks and microfinance banks to open accounts for the beneficiaries as per the arrangement made for this purpose. The framework will initially be adopted as a pilot for onboarding BISP beneficiaries in Karachi and Lahore. After the successful implementation of the pilot phase, the scope of the framework, with adjustments if needed, will be extended to other cities. The BISP will disburse the funds into these accounts through RAAST/IBFT.
The banks will arrange employee training programmes to facilitate BISP beneficiaries during the account/ ATM PIN activation and subsequent disbursement process. The banks will recover all upfront and ongoing costs associated with account opening, issuance and maintenance of ATM cards from the BISP, and no such charges will be levied on the BISP beneficiaries.
However, the fee for issuance of a replacement or duplicate debit or ATM Card before its expiry will be recovered from the BISP beneficiary.
The banks will not issue chequebooks to the BISP account holder or activate internet/mobile banking facilities.

8,Remittances at two-year high during Ramazan,"March inflows recorded at $2.95bn, highest since April 2022.","KARACHI: The quantum of remittances increased to almost $3 billion in March, taking it to the highest level since April 2022, primarily due to Ramazan, according to the central bank’s data.
The total remittances in March stood at $2.95bn compared to $2.25bn in Feb, a month-on-month increase of 31.2pc. The year-on-year increase was 16.4pc, compared to the inflows of $2.54bn in March 2023.
This is the highest remittances inflow since April 2022, when overseas Pakistanis sent $3.12bn, as per the State Bank’s data.
The country-wise breakdown for March shows that the highest inflow was from Saudi Arabia at $70.31m, up from 54m in Feb. Inflows from the US stood at $37.25m, up from 28.74m in Feb. Similarly, overseas Pakistanis sent $54.85m from the UAE, up from $38.48m last month.

March inflows recorded at $2.95bn, highest since April 2022

The inflows from the UK were $46.15m, $30.27m from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and $31.47m from the EU nations.
During the first nine months of FY24 (July-March), the year-on-year remittances quantum increased by 0.9pc despite slow inflows in the first half of the current fiscal year.
Total remittances during the nine months of this fiscal year were $21.04bn, up from $20.84bn in the same period last year.
Experts believe that higher inflows in March were because of Ramazan when inflows usually remained high due to charity and increased consumption.
The higher remittances inflows are helpful in reducing the current account deficit, stabilising the exchange rate and improving the overall confidence in the economic sector.
The remittances, which have already exceeded the revenue from export earnings, also help the State Bank in debt servicing, which is now considered the main threat to Pakistan’s economy.
The country would pay about $24bn in FY24, while $25bn would be required for debt servicing during the next fiscal year.
The remittances are higher than the country’s need for debt servicing, but the huge trade deficit eats up almost all inflows, forcing the government to borrow more money.According to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics data, the trade deficit widened year-on-year by 56.30pc to $2.17bn in March. However, the overall gap in the first nine months of the current fiscal year narrowed by 24.94pc to $17.03bn compared to $22.68bn in the corresponding period last year.

9,34 firms get licences for making electric vehicles,A senior EDB official said the most pressing issue was the lack of financing for customers.,"ISLAMABAD: The Engineering Development Board (EDB) has issued 34 licences to manufacturers of two- and three-wheelers under the Electric Vehicles Policy for 2020-2025, as part of the transition from traditional fuel-powered automobiles to EVs.
At the same time, private partners are jumping into EV manufacturing, said Asim Ayaz, a senior EDB official, in a speech during a webinar at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) on “Pakistan’s electric vehicle market: challenges, opportunities, and the 2030 agenda”  on Monday.
Mr Ayaz said the most pressing issue was the lack of financing for customers as EVs were more expensive than fuel-based vehicles due to the high price of batteries. He said the ministry had proposed that every petrol station have an EV charging station.
“The ministry has compared the National EV Policy with Malaysia’s and found that it is good in tariff. But we lack funding streams and financing solutions,” he said.
“The ministry is closely working with the Lahore University of Management Sciences (Lums) and other industry partners for adoption of EVs.”
Dr Arshad, a professor at Lums, emphasised that significant money was available for EVs on a worldwide scale, and the government would not need to rely on the IMF or World Bank for finance because the global community wants EVs as a means to cut carbon emissions rather than for economic development.
“Pakistan can tap that money by linking its EV transition ambition with GHG emissions, aligning it with GHG reduction perspective,” said Dr Arshad.
He further stated that global climate finance might be administered through a competitive procedure that would favour only well-planned and superior projects.
“The faster we go, the faster we will reach our goal,” he said. Midhat Waris said Shell Global had the world’s largest EV setup, with over 1000 charging stations, and it had tested its rapid chargers in Pakistan.
She also dwelt on the launch of Shell’s largest EV charging station in China, which has a capacity of 250 outlets. “We want to take key positions in terms of EV charging in Pakistan and K-Electric partnership is vital to achieving this ambition,” Waris said.
Japanese resistance
Dr Naveed Arshad said battery technology was evolving and demanded research and development, along with capital and technical resources.
Ahmed Sajeel of Deewan Motors BMW said Japanese car makers were resisting EVs, but their resistance was unsustainable in the current environment as the international vehicle industry had opted to shift to EVs.
He claimed that the Ministry of Climate Change is “highly friendly” and supportive of EVs, but the country needed a long-term regulatory framework to work effectively and avoid further delays.
Electric vehicles alone are not the solution, but infrastructure is essential, and manufacturing them locally is the way ahead because Pakistan is rich in silica and other raw minerals, he noted.
Dr Aazir Anwar Khan said EVs would have a significant impact on the middle class, which currently relies on two or three-wheelers.
“Air quality and environmental hazards are huge in the country due to transport sector emissions, whereas 60 per cent of imported oil is being consumed by motorbikes,” he added.
The country aims to move immediately from fuel-powered automobiles to EVs and the outlook for such a transition was favourable, Dr Aazir observed.

10,Ant group partners with Nayapay,A press release by the company said the program aims to enhance international visitors’ experience and drive business for local merchants.,"KARACHI: Ant Group, along with 11 overseas payment partners of Alipay+ and major international card organisations, has launched in Beijing a nationwide program to build International Consumer Friendly Zones across major Chinese tourist and commercial cities, with the support of relevant authorities and local governments.
A press release issued on Monday said the program aims to enhance international visitors’ experience and drive business for local merchants.
At the launch, Alipay+ jointly announced with NayaPay, Pakistan’s leading fintech platform, that NayaPay users will be able to make payments with their e-money account at Alipay+’s extensive network of 80 million merchants in China as bilateral trade and visits increase.
NayaPay thus becomes the 11th overseas and 1st Pakistani payments platform to “roam” in China, following AlipayHK (Hong Kong SAR, China), Changi Pay (Singapore), HiPay (Mongolia), Kakao Pay (South Korea), MPay (Macao SAR, China), Naver Pay (South Korea), OCBC Digital (Singapore), Toss Pay (South Korea), Touch ‘n’ Go eWallet (Malaysia), and TrueMoney (Thailand).
Ant Group now offers two mobile payment alternatives for overseas visitors in China. Alipay+, a suite of cross-border mobile payment and digitalisation technology solutions under Ant International, enables overseas consumers to pay with their home e-wallets across China.
Introduced in 2020, Alipay+ now connects over 88 million merchants in 57 countries and regions to 1.5 billion consumer accounts on over 25 e-wallets and banking apps. This allows consumers to travel and pay worry-free globally and merchants to boost revenue through a growing portfolio of digitalisation tools.
Travellers may also choose to bind major international bank cards, including Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover®, and Diners Club International, to an Alipay app to access a rich array of local Alipay services from shopping, dining, ride-hailing to public transportation while in the Chinese mainland, without needing a local bank account or phone number.
On this occasion, Danish A. Lakhani, CEO of NayaPay, said today marks a monumental milestone in the commercial relationship between China and Pakistan as we witness establishing the first direct payment channels between our two nations.

Brent crude futures fell $1.07, or 1.2 per cent, to $90.10 a barrel by 1:26 p.m. ET (1726 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude was down 85 cents, or 1pc, at $86.06.
Both benchmarks fell more than $2 earlier in the session, with investors focusing on Israel’s decision to withdraw more soldiers from southern Gaza on Sunday.
Also weighing on oil prices were expectations that US crude oil stocks likely rose last week, Staunovo said.
However, the decline in oil prices should be modest until it becomes clear how Iran will respond to the bombing of its consulate in Syria last week, he added.
The bombing, for which Tehran has said it will take revenge, heightened concerns that the Middle East conflict could broaden and have tangible impacts to oil supplies.

As the export ban has failed to provide any price relief, exporters have asked the government to extend it till April 30.
In a letter to the Ministry of Commerce, All Pakistan Fruits and Vegetables Exporters, Importers and Merchants Association (PFVA) Patron in Chief Waheed Ahmed said that exporters had unanimously decided to extend the ban by 15 days for the country’s interest.

Chicken, gold rates hit new peak ahead of Eidul Fitr

Amid a surge in exports following an Indian ban, consumers have paid up to Rs350 per kg for locally produced onion compared to Rs50-120 per kg in September 2023. Pakistan restricted exports from the second week of March 2024 to lower the onion prices but consumers did not get any relief.
The Indian government initially imposed a ban on Dec 8, 2023 till March 31 but recently extended it till further orders to ensure domestic availability and stabilise prices.
Pakistani onion exporters took full advantage of the Indian ban to earn handsome foreign exchange at the cost of unbearable local prices.
Karachi’s official onion rate is Rs219 per kg, but traders charge Rs250-Rs300 per kg.
Boosting confidence
According to APP, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal, speaking at the PBC, said that the government was confident and focused on improving all the factors linked with the economy to boost the business community’s confidence.
He said that the ministry was well aware of its responsibility to reach out to the business community for input and was determined to do its utmost to resolve the challenges that businessmen and industrialists face.
He said that the government and the business community were considering the options to move things positively.
He said smuggling was also controlled to a greater extent in the previous caretaker government period and some of the initiatives needed to be taken ahead. 
“Steps were taken during the last five months to improve the border control mechanism and now the government has decided to establish a dedicated authority to enable all the concerned departments to operate under one umbrella,” he added.
Jam acknowledged that suggestions were received from car manufacturers and that decisions would be made ahead of the next budget.
Regarding the deteriorating security situation in Karachi, he said that law and order are provincial subjects. However, the federal government would continue extending its cooperation and bring improvement.
Chicken
As Eidul Fitr is just one day away, retailers have increased the price of broiler live birds by up to Rs540 per kg from Rs420-460 per kg two weeks ago.
Surprisingly, Commissioner Karachi’s retail price for broiler live birds is Rs428 per kg. Ignoring the official poultry meat rate of Rs663, retailers charge Rs760-800 per kg to consumers.
Gold at new peak
The local one-tola gold rates hit an all-time high of Rs245,700 on Monday, up by Rs600 per tola based on world bullion prices, which also reached a record $2,355 per ounce, up by $5 per ounce.

15,PSX sets record on ‘good news’ from S. Arabia,"KARACHI: Amid growing prospects of realising Saudi investment in diversified sectors, the stock market on Monday...","KARACHI: Amid growing prospects of realising Saudi investment in diversified sectors, the stock market on Monday turned in another record-breaking session in Ramazan, tossing the KSE 100-share index to an all-time high, closing above 69,500, though the volume fell day-on-day.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation told Dawn that Saudi Arabia’s commitment to fast-track the initial tranche of $5 billion investment in Pakistan boosted investor confidence, triggering a strong interest in blue-chip oil, banking, and pharma stocks as investors weigh deliberations over the $1 bn Saudi Reko Diq deal next month and Saudi oil-giant Aramco’s acquisition of stakes in Oil and Gas Development Company and Pakistan Petroleum Ltd.
Reports suggest this commitment was reached at a meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Makkah on Sunday night.
Mr Mehanti also noted that a surge in Brent crude prices above $90 per barrel, higher banking spreads and a high court case vacated against pharmaceuticals over the deregulation of non-essential medicines also contributed to a spectacular rally one day ahead of the long Eidul Fitr closure.
He, however, advised retail investors to remain cautious and focus on high dividend-paying stocks owing to the geopolitical crisis and government approvals to raise gas tariffs for captive power plants ahead of talks with the IMF for a new bailout.
He hoped easing political noise and speculations over IMF talks and climate change funds could send the PSX to new highs post-Eidul Fitr.
Arif Habib Ltd Head of Research Tahir Abbas said the market was upbeat as Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is planning to leave for Washington to attend IMF/World Bank spring meetings, where he was expected to negotiate a new Extended Fund Facility crucial for the long-term sustainability of the country. 
“With inflation slowing down, investors are also anticipating an interest rate reversal soon, which is also boosting their confidence,” he added.
Topline Securities Ltd said the market started the shorter week (two trading sessions before Eid holidays) with a bang. Bulls resumed their northbound march as investors opted to further strengthen their equity positions by value hunting across the board, especially in blue-chip stocks. 
Consequently, fertiliser, power, banks and tech contributed positively as Fauji Fertiliser Company, Hub Power Company Ltd, MCB Ban, Systems Ltd and Meezan Bank collectively added 486 points to the index performance. 
Pak-Kuwait Investment Company Ltd Head of Research Samiullah Tariq thinks the bullish market is incorporating recent stability in forex reserves, overall confidence in the sovereign bond market, hopes of a new IMF deal, and expectations of the materialisation of a deal with the Saudi government.
As a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index hit an intraday record high of 69,710.84, gaining 1,294.05 points. However, it closed at 69,616.84 points after adding 1,203.20 points, or 1.76 per cent from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume dipped 13.61pc to 335.61 million shares. The traded value fell by 14.35pc to Rs15.31bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan Telecomm­unication Company Ltd (33.75m shares), The Searle Company Ltd (21.10m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (18.13m shares), K-Electric Ltd (17.48m shares) and Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (16.69m shares).
The companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited (Rs150.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs48.88), Shahmurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs41.93), Sazgar Engineering Company Ltd (Rs32.72) and Highnoon Laboratories Ltd (Rs26.04).
