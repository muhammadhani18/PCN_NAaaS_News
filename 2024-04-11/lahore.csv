1,Delay in PPSC head’s appointment halts recruitment process,"LAHORE: The Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) has been in a state of uncertainty for the past two months,...","LAHORE: The Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) has been in a state of uncertainty for the past two months, leaving hundreds of candidates who cleared the PPSC examination in limbo.
The candidates have been anxiously awaiting their interview schedules since the retirement of PPSC Chairman Malik Zafar Iqbal on Feb 14.
The recruitment process through PPSC has come to a standstill after Mr. Iqbal’s retirement, causing distress among the candidates. The PPSC, which is responsible for conducting tests, examinations, and interviews for recruitment, and advising the government on matters relating to the terms and conditions of service of provincial service members, has been rendered non-functional due to the absence of a chairman.
This has led to administrative problems and has put the future of the candidates, including those on reserve and revised lists waiting for their appointment on different posts, in jeopardy. The candidates, who have put in significant effort to clear the provincial competitive examination, are now urging the government to expedite the process of appointing a new chairman.  
They believe that the appointment of a new chairman will help in processing their interviews and conducting examinations for the advertised seats of different provincial departments. The delay in the appointment of a new chairman has not only affected the candidates but also the functioning of various provincial departments that are waiting for fresh recruits.
One of the candidates waiting for a revised list told Dawn that he had been continuously contacting the PPSC officials for his appointment as his name was on top of the revised list of a grade-17 post for the last two months.  
He was informed by the PPSC officials that the process would not be completed until the appointment of the chairman.
Another candidate, who appeared in a written examination for a grade-17 post, said that he was waiting for the result. Every time he contacted the PPSC office, he was told that the recruitment process was halted until the appointment of a new chairman.
Under the Punjab Public Service Commission Ordinance, 1978, the Punjab governor is required to appoint the chairman and the members of the commission. No person can be appointed as chairman or member above or 65 years of age and the person should not be serving the government.
The candidates are demanding swift action from the government to resolve this issue and ensure the smooth functioning of the PPSC.

4,Plea in LHC against renaming of government buildings after elite,Petitioner says there is no logic in naming or renaming the public places after the politicians and others.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has been asked to declare illegal the attribution of government buildings, parks and hospitals to politicians, ruling elites and feudal lords.
A citizen, Mashkoor Hussain, filed a petition in the court alleging that Imam Bibi Maternity Hospital, Sialkot, which was named after the mother of national poet Dr Allama Iqbal, has been renamed after the late father of Defence Minister Khwaja Asif as Khwaja Safdar Hospital.
The petitioner through his counsel Nadeem Sarwar states that the conduct of the provincial government and functionaries shows that the cities, towns, streets and all public institutions are treated as part of some undeclared kingdoms of local feudal and political lords.
He pleads that naming and renaming the institutions, towns, cities, roads and streets is also part of their kingdom rule, which depicts the mindset of our politicians and ruling elites.
He argues that the public institutions and infrastructures are not the property of the government as they belong to all citizens. He says there is no logic in naming or renaming the public places after the politicians and others.
The petitioner contends if taxes or fees are spent in violation of the law, it would amount to breach of public trust and denial of the citizens’ fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
He argues that the public funds should not be used for personal glorification, but government buildings and other places should be attributed to national heroes instead.
He asks the court to declare that naming, renaming any street, road,  
government institute, town, or city after the name of any individual having no positive social, role, courage or exceptional dedication to service is illegal, unlawful against the basic rights of citizens of respective areas.
He also asks the court to direct the authorities to remove the signboards and other advertisements showing the names of public places after politicians, ruling elites and feudal lords in the province.
The petitioner furnished a list of 23 public places, hospitals and schools named after different politicians, including former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.

5,Petition against kite flying,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has been approached for a strict implementation of the Punjab Prohibition of Kite...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has been approached for a strict implementation of the Punjab Prohibition of Kite Flying (Amendment) Act, 2009 so that lives of the citizens can be saved from damage or fatal loss.
Judicial Activism Panel Chairman Advocate Azhar Siddique filed a petition in the wake of a recent incident of a death of a young motorcyclist in Faisalabad due to kite twine.
The petitioner pleads that the purpose of the legislation was to ensure public safety and health by curbing dangerous kite flying practices that led to a loss of precious human lives and injuries in the province.
Another further purpose of the law was to discourage citizens from engaging in kite flying using metallic or glass-embedded strings, which are banned for being a threat to public safety.
The petitioner laments that the relevant government agencies have utterly failed in curbing fatal kite flying incidents and to enforce the relevant law in its letter and spirit. He argues that in the present circumstances, legislation for a comprehensive ban on kite flying is imperative.
He asks the court to permanently ban kite flying in Punjab till the government adopts any positive measures, including improvement in the legislation as well as a mechanism to curb manufacturing, refining and smuggling of the thread used for kite flying.

6,A low-cost sustainable housing solution for flood-hit areas,LAHORE: Severe effects of climate change and global warming hit Pakistan hard in the form of devastating floods in...,"LAHORE: Severe effects of climate change and global warming hit Pakistan hard in the form of devastating floods in recent years. 
According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), floods damaged or destroyed more than 2.3 million homes in the country in 2022 while the situation was even worse in 2023. Many of the people still have inadequate housing in affected areas, especially in the areas of Sindh and south Punjab. 
An organisation, Safe Delivery Safe Mother (SDSM), in collaboration with Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, has come up with a plan to build and develop a low-cost and sustainable housing model for the people whose houses were destroyed by the floods.  
Mehreen Shahid, the founder of the SDSM having a background in welfare work in maternal health and family planning, is the project lead. Her organisation has done work in flood relief.  
“I visited Japan last year and we had discussions with Shigeru Ban. His team sent us the design of a house for the flood-hit areas. We did some customisation in the Pakistani context in terms of available material and sourcing. We had an understanding with Japanese architects that the material should be local and low-cost,” says Mehreen. 
The brainstorming involving Japanese and Pakistani experts culminated in a design of a house built with paper tubes, bamboo, plastic crates and thatch.  
“The paper tubes have never been used in Pakistan before. The entire structure stands on paper tubes, which has been treated to make them moisture and water resilient. The walls have been made by bamboos but we are flexible about the walls and changes can be made to them. However, bamboo is more effective as they are low-cost in our target areas, especially Sindh. Mud can also be used on the walls and bamboo can be replaced,” says Mehreen while explaining the design whose prototype has been made in Lahore. 
When asked about the innovation part of the design, Mehreen points out that the main innovation having cost effectiveness is the structure made of paper tubes and bamboo.  
“We have put a layer of water resistant marine plywood on the floor and under used plastic crates on the ground and made a foundation by filling sand in them. The foundation has a spacing which lets the water go through it in case of a low flood so that it does not keep standing to damage the structure. The roof is water resistant and contains plastic besides other material like thatch. Each room has two windows.” 
All the material to be used in the house is local, including the paper tubes, marine plywood, bamboos and thatch. 
Mehreen says that the Japanese architects, led by Shigeru Ban, tested the structure in Japan and it sustained the earthquake measuring 7 on the Richter scale. This design has already been used and tested in Manila, Philippines etc. The height of the structure can also be increased according to the local needs while size can also be increased, she adds. 
Mehreen and her team built a prototype to test the bamboo walls in the heavy rains, claiming that they can keep the water out as the testing process proved. 
For any new design the input from the local people who would use it is necessary. Mehreen claims that they have got the input of the local people at the start when the design was being discussed. Regarding the roof, Mehreen says they have got input from the locals who also suggested that mud can also be used on it.  
“Bamboo is a commonly used material in Sindh and other flood areas. The actual new material for the people here is the paper tube. Our team will help the locals and train them to build it on their own,” she explains. 
The SDSM has a plan to start the project in the flood-hit areas of south Punjab as well as Sindh, including Dadu and Jamshoro. But initially they are planning to launch the project in Rajanpur district of south Punjab. It was one of the worst-affected districts of the region. 
Regarding the design, Hasan Wasti, the architect and technical lead, says they would keep doing RnD (research and development) for further improvement in the prototype. For example, heat is a major factor and we already have a margin for insulation in the walls to shut the heat out. 
For the paper tubes, he says they have done the sourcing as they are making it with new raw material.  
“We put it through strength testing to see whether it was applicable for construction or not. We have tested it for water resilience and then did its treatment with polyurethane, a resilient, flexible and durable manufactured material,” he informs. 
About the plan to build the house on ground, he says paper tubes are a part of prefabrication.  
Prefabrication means assembling components of a structure in a factory or other manufacturing site, and transporting complete assemblies or sub-assemblies to the construction site.  
“All the cutting for the assembly is made ready and then transported to the target area, saving our time. But the case with bamboo is different as every piece is generally different and can’t be a part of prefabrication.” 
The house can be made with just one skilled person with the involvement of the community and it does not require that much skilled labour as is needed in the brick and concrete structures, Hasan asserts. 
Funding for any welfare project is important and Mehreen thinks that it’s unreasonable to expect funding from the local people who are already suffering.  
“We have local partners already working in the flood-hit areas. We have to see different avenues for fundraising but the community would have to make some contribution to have their ownership in it.” 
About the cost of the house, Mehreen says that the brick and cement houses are constructed at double cost compared to the SDSM design. The cost of this 12/12 prototype is Rs380,000, which is very feasible, she adds.  
“We can scale it up and plan to cut, treat and prepare the material in Lahore and then send it to target areas to be assembled there,” she says. 
Mehreen Shahid hopes that the locals would welcome the design once they see the whole of it because flood-hit areas still lack rehabilitation work in terms of construction.  
To the question of the longevity of the structure, Hasan thinks that the material and structure can survive up to the minimum eight to 10 years.

-Dawn

 
SAHIWAL: After completion of High Resolution Satellite Imagery (HRSI) of 36 districts of Punjab, the drone mapping of urban localities has started in Sahiwal under the World Bank-funded project of Punjab Urban Land System Enhancement (PULSE).
Deputy Commissioner Ikramul Haq is now overseeing the pilot project under the PULSE to drone map urban localities. It will be extended to other districts of Punjab once the pilot project here is over within next week or so.
The DC said on the basis of HRSI all districts have now been divided into two zones-- high density control points and low density control points -- which means urban and rural localities of each district.
“Since high resolution images of both urban and rural areas have been taken, now drone images will be taken for direct measurement and intensive land ownership verification.”
The DC said the drones can capture detailed and high-resolution imagery which provides a clear and comprehensive view of urban areas.
The drone imagery has a high-resolution aerial view which is time-efficient and has improved accuracy of land ownership record. After the development of digitised base map, the ownership details of urban land pieces will be integrated with the existing land ownership record of Punjab Land Record Authority (PLRA) database.
At the rural side, missing mouzas/village information has been streamlined through scanning which will upgrade the centuries old land record through on-ground and field verification.
“The whole drone imagery exercise is aimed at improving land and property register of hereditary land both in urban and rural localities,” the DC further added.
It will also help in future decision-making processes to improve land and property registry, he said.

The provincial government has notified a 16-member DCC with at least eight lawmakers belonging to PML-Q and two to PML-N -- MNA Naseer Abbas Sidhu and Abid Raza Kotla.
The deputy commissioner is the secretary of the committee which also includes district police officer and chief executive officers of health and education authorities.
Talking to Dawn here on Monday, Mr Kotla said he had conveyed to the personal staff of CM Maryam Nawaz that he could not accept the membership of such a committee being headed by a Q leader who had just obtained 8,000 votes on the Punjab Assembly seat and still became a lawmaker and a provincial minister.
He said forging a coalition with the PML-Q might be a compulsion of party Quaid Nawaz Sharif but the Gujrat chapter of PML-N did not accept such an arrangement with those who had consistently harmed the local PML-N workers for long.
He vowed to do the politics of resistance against the Q-League and invited members of PTI’s Parvez Elahi camp in Gujrat to join him in resistance against the hegemony of PML-Q in the district.
The Gujrat district chapter of PML-N also held a consultative meeting on Sunday where issues pertaining to the local political and administration affairs were discussed.
Another former MNA Nawabzada Ghazanfar Ali Gul, the head of the Nawabzada family, said in a statement that despite having reservations over party’s arrangement with the PML-Q, he firmly stood with Mian Nawaz Sharif due to critical political and economic conditions of the country.
He said there was no question of joining hands with any of the factions of the rival Chaudhry family.
He announced an unconditional support to the party leadership but said he would convey or discuss his reservations in some meeting with the senior party leadership instead of publicly putting any pressure on them.

22,"Governance issues, corruption jeopardise LDA service delivery",SWOT analysis advises against delegating additional charge of DG.,"LAHORE: A recent SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis reveals that the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) has been facing serious governance-related issues amid corruption that requires immediate attention and intervention from the government to improve service delivery.
Based on simulation exercise, the analysis was conducted during the 39th mid-career management course (Research Group-6) organized by the National Institute of Management, Lahore, on Chief Minister Task Force for Inspecting Public Service Delivery of LDA.
Discussing governance, the analysis identifies one-window cell, digitisation of record, adoption of international standards, urban regeneration projects, disaster resilience planning, public private partnership, GIS mapping, artificial intelligence, planned urban development, stakeholders’ management and litigation issues as “strengths and opportunities” of the LDA. However, the rapid urbanisation /informal settlements, enforcement/encroachment issues, infrastructure deficiencies, governance and transparency, political interference, corruption and bribery, litigation, budgetary constraints and land mafia have been identified as “weaknesses and threats” of the authority.
Discussing the issues, the report mentions human resource as one of the major issues given the vacant posts of 373 officers (BS-17 to BS-20). It also raises concerns over performance of various LDA directorates, as they raised objections on total 173,190 applications and sent replies to the applicants through one-window cell.

SWOT analysis advises against delegating additional charge of DG

In 2023, the LDA’s planning, engineering, headquarters, housing and town planning wings received total 80,4071 applications (28,031, 01, 99, 512,167 and 263,503, respectively). Of these, the LDA directorates disposed of 400,985 applications, out of which 176,072 and 224,913 applications were disposed of timely and with delay, respectively. The directorates approved 365,131 applications, while rejecting 35,854 others.
The report recommends hiring of legal experts, digitizing/sifting of record, monthly feedback of complaint (response) timeliness, enhancement of one-window cell’s capacity, crackdown against unlawful activities, and devising of a mechanism for monitoring.
It also suggests the government should not appoint director general (DG) of LDA on a temporary basis (by entrusting the officers with additional or look after charge).
“Despite being an old, autonomous and financially independent authority, the LDA failed in achieving its mission of effective service delivery, it faces significant challenges related to budget, HR and procedural constraints, lack of innovation and IT infrastructure, bureaucratic and policy insufficiency. LDA needs to effectively address these issues through targeted actions to improve existing IT & AI structures, revenue generation, staff upgrade, improved accountability methods, stakeholder management and public inclusion. These targeted actions are critical to enhance LDA’s full potential in efficient service delivery on par with international standards,” the analysis concludes.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, in a recent review meeting, had also expressed grave concerns over the rising public complaints, related to corruption and other issues, against LDA. During the meeting, she also sought improving service delivery by all means with a direction to newly-appointed LDA DG Tahir Farooq to make all-out efforts to give relief to the public at large, besides taking innovative initiatives to make Lahore a “sustainable and livable” city under a phased programme.

The transformation plan ranges from the provision of interest-free loans to small farmers for watercourses’ improvement, tube wells’ solarisation and laser leveling to legislative action and institutional reforms.
Speaking to Dawn, Punjab Agriculture Secretary Iftikhar Ali Sahoo said the initiatives announced in the plan would address the fundamental issues like farmers’ access to credit, quality of agricultural research, improving agricultural extension and water efficiency.

He further stated that government buildings, particularly colleges, schools, and university halls, should be prioritised as examination centres.
Dr Naveed also proposed that the School Education Department (SED) secretary be made a permanent member of the PBCC.
In an effort to prevent the leakage of question papers, Dr Naveed directed the participants to devise a plan for the use of watermarks and the move is expected to significantly enhance the security of examination materials.
The meeting concluded with a firm resolve to uphold the integrity of the examination process and ensure a fair and transparent system for all students.

30,Ministries failure to repatriate kids of two women irks court,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday expressed serious displeasure over the failure of foreign and interior...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday expressed serious displeasure over the failure of foreign and interior ministries to extradite minor children of two women despite the lapse of over two years.
Chief Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan was hearing petitions by two women seeking repatriation of their children, who were allegedly illegally removed from Pakistan by their respective fathers.
Federal Secretary for Interior retired Capt Khurram Agha appeared before the court and furnished reports on behalf of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
The secretary told the court that he took charge of the office a week ago following the retirement of his predecessor. He sought two months for the implementation of the court’s orders regarding the extradition of the minors.
An official of the foreign affairs office also appeared before the court but no report was submitted on behalf of Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
The chief justice observed that prima facie the act of the foreign minister appeared to be contemptuous. “But I refrain from issuing any proceedings against him and he is directed to remain careful in future and furnish a report,” the chief justice added.
Rejecting the request of the interior secretary, the CJ remarked that the petitions were pending for over two years and countless adjournments had been granted to the authorities on one pretext or another.
The justice observed that the interior ministry was full of incompetent officials.
In one case, the CJ noted that the interior ministry lied to the court regarding the arrest of the child’s father.
The CJ adjourned the hearing till May 8 and observed that both ministers and the prime minister can be summoned in person if compliance of the court’s orders was not made.
“Mr Mohsin Naqvi, Federal Minister of Interior, Islamabad and Mr Ishaq Dar, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs, Islamabad shall again submit comprehensive report on the next date regarding the steps taken for the recovery of minors and extradition of accused of this case,” CJ Khan said in his order.
Rabia Imtiaz filed a petition in 2021 while Anam Jahan approached the court in 2022 seeking recovery of their children. They pleaded that the fathers of the minors unlawfully removed them from Pakistan on fake documents as there were restraining orders by respective guardian courts.

31,Shujaat-Parvez rift blamed on Naqvi,"PTI polling agents being detained, says Qaisra","GUJRAT: Qaisra Elahi, the wife of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf President Parvez Elahi, and her sister Sumaira Elahi have accused Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi of creating a division among Shujaat Hussain and Parvez Elahi.
They also blamed the local police for detaining the polling agents of PTI candidate Chaudhry Parvez for the bypolls in PP-32 (Kunjah) at the behest of the rival candidate of PML-Q so that they could not perform duties on the voting day on April 21.
They made these remarks while addressing a news conference at Gujrat Press Club here on Monday.
They said Parvez Elahi was still sincerely standing by Imran Khan.

PTI polling agents being detained, says Qaisra

Qaisra Elahi said the sons of Shujaat Hussain presented themselves as heirs of Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi Shaheed but their politics was contrary to their claim.
Was it Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi’s policy to raid people’s houses and pick them up? she asked. “For the by-election, the polling agents and workers of Parvez Elahi are being picked up by the police.”
Samaira Elahi said these two brothers had violated the sanctity of the houses in Gujrat. “The way Salik and Shafay Hussain stole the general election, we will not allow this to happen in the by-election.”
Qaisra Elahi said: “I thought that Salik and Shafay would come out of their inferiority complex by sitting in high positions, but this did not happen.”
Qaisra and Sumaira said Mohsin Naqvi had played an important role in creating a rift between Shujaat Hussain and Parvez Elahi.
They further said Salik Hussain tried to meet Parvez Elahi continuously in Adiala and PIMS but Parvez refused to meet him and also sent back the flowers.
They said the brothers, who became federal and provincial ministers by stealing the election, were only harbouring hatred for Gujrat.
