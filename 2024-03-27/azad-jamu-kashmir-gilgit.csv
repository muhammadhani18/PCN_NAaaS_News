0,Flood drains’ desilting on the anvils,WASA seeks Rs30 million from Punjab government,"The Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) has devised a plan aimed at preventing floods in Nullah Leh and ensuring smooth rainwater drainage through the city's major rain drains ahead of the monsoon season in Rawalpindi.
The plan entails desilting, deepening, and widening the 18 km long Nullah Leh along with 10 key rain drains before the onset of the rainy season.
To facilitate this crucial initiative, immediate funds amounting to Rs30 million have been sought from the government.
However, the current economic challenges, including the soaring costs of petrol, diesel, machinery rents, and labour, have led to an estimated additional expenditure of Rs15 million to Rs20 million for silt cleaning.
The financial constraints in Punjab have also impacted other vital projects such as the Nullah Leh Expressway and Sewage Water Treatment Plant, which have been put on hold, pushing the estimated cost of the Nullah Leh Expressway project to over Rs100 billion from its initial estimation of Rs17 billion in 2007.
Efforts to kickstart the silt cleaning of Nullah Leh are slated to begin immediately after Eidul Fitr, with a target completion date set for May 31. This timeline aligns with the upcoming monsoon season, which is expected to span from June 15 to September 15 in Rawalpindi.
As part of the preparation, surveys for silt cleaning have already commenced, and Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) Director General (DG) Kinza Murtaza has banned encroachments, garbage dumping, and building material disposal along Nullah Leh's banks. The desilting process, including that of the 10 major drains, will be outsourced to the private sector under WASA's supervision, with contracts segmented across different areas for efficient management.
The private sector's involvement extends to deploying heavy and light machinery for silt cleaning and deepening catchment areas by three to five feet to enhance rainwater drainage. Additionally, measures like straightening and widening bends along Nullah Leh aim to mitigate erosion risks and facilitate faster rainwater flow.
Looking ahead, WASA is gearing up for stricter flood control measures in anticipation of heavy monsoon rains this year. Tenders for silt cleaning are set to be issued post-Eid, with operations slated to commence within the next 30 days. Wasa MD has emphasised the importance of timely safety measures, highlighting last year's successful flood prevention efforts despite heavy rainfall and the commitment to enhanced security arrangements this year.

1,Islamabad’s food scene booms with iftar buffets,Fast food chains attempt to attract customers during Ramazan by offering special iftar buffets with special discounts,"Several food outlets in the capital city are offering mouth-watering iftar menus and buffets ranging from Rs2,000 to Rs6,000 per head during the holy month of Ramazan.
The majority of families prefer breaking fast at home. However, most of the fast food chains attempt to attract customers during Ramazan by offering special iftar buffets with special discounts.
The trend of buffet iftar has also created an environment of competition among popular food outlets in the capital city. Several food outlets claimed that they slashed their prices, especially during the holy month of Ramazan. The fast food outlets, which have delivery service year-round, offer deliveries during Ramazan from 6pm to dawn without any additional charges.
Isma Khan, a resident of F-6, said she loves to have iftar outside with the family once a week, however, she said her family always prefer fresh and home-cooked food to avoid health complications. “I prefer the food I cook myself. No way will there be fast food unless the kids are insisting,” she added.
“My kids and I avoid fast food during Ramazan as the meal because it is full of fat and that is not good at all for our health,” said another resident of F-10, Syed Farhan, adding that “I don’t prefer iftar outside unless there is a family gathering”.

2,Educators dismayed over new policies,Say fresh measures by the department will destroy education system,"The teachers unions expressing grave concerns over newly introduced policies of the education department have warned that the new measures may have serious repercussions on the education sector.
Among the new policies, the provincial education department has approved the LPR leave applications of all teachers seeking one year of leave before retirement. Furthermore, it has been decided to take first-year admissions before matriculation results this year, while the department also plans to recruit teachers on daily wages rather than making permanent appointments.
There is also a plan to hand over 15,000 government schools to the private sector under a public-private partnership. As the new policies take effect, teachers' unions have protested strongly, warning that these measures will destroy the education system.
Punjab Teachers Union President Chaudhary Sarfraz and Secretary General Rana Liaquat said that currently, around 30,000 female and male teachers have applied for leave on LPR before retirement, and if all of them are granted the leave, a sudden shortfall of teachers may occur. They said that 125,000 seats of teachers are lying vacant in 47,000 government schools, yet no teachers have been recruited for the last six years. Currently, in most villages, primary and middle schools are run by one or two teachers. By sanctioning LPR holidays, this number will further decrease, which will ruin the teaching system.
The teacher leaders further said that the government is also planning to recruit teachers on daily wages, which would be a very serious joke. There will be no holidays for the daily teachers, and their wages will be cut on holidays. Whoever comes as a teacher will only work daily and will leave the job as soon as there is a replacement.
The union leaders said that more than 10,000 to 15,000 government schools have been started through public-private partnerships, making education more expensive for the poor and lower-middle-class citizens as they pay hefty fees at such schools. Moreover, land worth billions of rupees belonging to government schools will also be sold.
The teachers have demanded a national education policy be made immediately by taking all the stakeholders into confidence. All vacant seats for teachers should be filled permanently. Admissions in the first year before the matriculation results will make the education system a joke. If the admitted students fail or get a compartment in the results, then what will be the result of this admission? Its implications should also be considered.

3,Twin cities alive with sehri feasts,"Families and friends gather at bustling eateries, fostering bonds of togetherness","In the spirit of Ramadan, the streets of twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad have been echoing with the laughter and chatter of families and friends gathering for sehri at various food points.
Many eateries, especially catering to sehri meals witness a bustling scene as residents indulge in a variety of delectable dishes, including well-loved dishes such as nihari, barbecue, chicken karahi, and halwa puri - all of which are emblematic of the Garrison city's rich culinary heritage.
As daybreak approaches, families flock to their favourite food spots, eager to partake in the pre-dawn meal before beginning their fast. Amongst the throngs of people, the atmosphere is one filled with joy and camaraderie, as residents express their delight in celebrating Ramazan with loved ones.
A local resident, Abdul Mateen, commented, “There’s something special about coming together with family and friends for sehri during Ramazan. It’s not just about the food, it's about the bonds we share and the sense of community that this month fosters.”
Echoing Mateen’s sentiments, Ayat Fatima, another attendee, remarked, “Ramazan holds a special place in our hearts, and gathering for sehri with our loved ones amplifies the blessings of this sacred month. It’s a time for reflection, gratitude, and togetherness.”
The tradition of communal sehri holds deep significance for Pindi’s residents, as it symbolises unity, generosity and the importance of shared experiences. As the month progresses, the vibrant vibes of Ramazan are expected to continue, culminating in the joyous celebrations of Eidul Fitr.
With the aroma of traditional delicacies lingering in the air and the sounds of laughter filling the streets, the twin cities appear to have embraced the spirit of Ramazan wholeheartedly, embodying the essence of community and compassion that defines this auspicious time of the year.

4,‘Crystal meth addict’ guns down friend,Growing sale of ice in ‘ordinary’ Islamabad sectors worries authorities,"The growing use of crystal meth, famously known as ice, has set off alarm bells in the federal capital once again after the gruesome murder of a youth by a close friend, reported under the influence of the potent drug.
The drug, known as one of the most addictive and deadliest of all illegal drugs, has claimed two lives in Islamabad in the recent past. The sale of this harmful drug to young people is reportedly behind these tragic incidents.
According to police sources, a friendship turned deadly when Ahsan Ullah and Jawad, who shared a close bond, were caught in the grip of the lethal drug ice.
Despite Ahsan Ullah’s efforts to steer Jawad away from this addiction and seek help for him, the situation took a tragic turn. Jawad, consumed by rage and under the influence of ice, fatally attacked Ahsan in G-9 Auto Colony.
Ahsan, employed at PWD, lost his life, while Jawad, reportedly unemployed, fled the scene. The police have initiated a murder case, with Jawad being the primary suspect still at large.
In another distressing incident a couple of years ago, the son of a prominent construction firm owner in Sector F-7, fuelled by excessive ice consumption, committed a horrendous act against a young woman.
This act led to his arrest and subsequent sentencing by a district court.
A senior official from the federal police highlighted the alarming rise of drug addiction, particularly among the youth in upscale sectors of Islamabad. This trend has now spread to ordinary residential areas, posing a significant threat to the well-being of the younger generation already grappling with economic challenges.
Meanwhile, citizens have demanded that law enforcement authorities must devise specialised action plans targeting drug dealers. Establishing secret police units alongside regular stations could help apprehend drug traffickers and protect communities from the devastating impact of drug abuse.
The incidents serve as stark reminders of the urgent need to combat drug addiction and protect lives in the capital city, they said.

5,Pollen surge concerns rise for allergy sufferers,Pollen and mould ratio has surged this year compared to previous years in Islamabad,"The pollen and mould ratio has surged this year compared to previous years in Islamabad, according to a recent report by the Pakistan Meteorological Department. The measurements, crucial for allergy sufferers, indicate a significant increase in airborne allergens from trees, grass, weeds, and moulds in the region.
Using a Burkhard sampler that operates continuously for 24 hours, pollen and mould spores are collected and analysed on slides by experts to determine their quantity and type. The severity of pollen and mould counts is measured in grains per cubic meter, with each type of pollen assigned a severity level based on its concentration found on the slide.
Today’s readings reveal a notably high pollen ratio in the city, with Paper Mulberry registering at 45,103, which is categorized as “very high” on the severity scale. Pine, Grass, Cannabis, and Alternaria are also notably elevated at 22, 24, 25, and 27 respectively, contributing to a total ratio of 45,201.
The interpretation of pollen and mould counts and their correlation with allergy symptoms is complex, with symptoms varying among individuals and at different levels of pollen and mould concentrations. Weather conditions further complicate the situation, as allergy sufferers often find relief on rainy, cloudy, or windless days due to limited pollen movement. Conversely, hot, dry, and windy conditions lead to higher pollen and mould concentrations, exacerbating allergy symptoms.
Individuals sensitive to these allergens need to be vigilant, as even small concentrations can trigger symptoms. Extremely sensitive individuals may experience severe reactions. The findings underscore the need for allergy sufferers to take necessary precautions and consult healthcare professionals for appropriate management strategies.
As the pollen season progresses, continued monitoring of pollen counts and weather conditions will be essential for mitigating allergic reactions in the affected population.

6,Bird hazard committee takes flight in Rawalpindi,"Aims to remove bird cages from rooftops, prevent avian collisions with aircraft","The Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) on Wednesday constituted a special committee to remove cages of birds from residential rooftops and other preventive measures in different parts of the city. The committee was set up under the chairmanship of the Director of Estate Management.
The meeting of the Bird Hazard Control Committee was held under the chairmanship of RDA Director General Kinza Murtaza to take immediate measures to remove bird cages from the roofs of houses and other measures to prevent birds from colliding with planes in the air and causing accidents.
During the meeting, an officer of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) gave a presentation on bird hazards and garbage dumping threats to national assets. The meeting was informed that the presence of birds, particularly, pigeons, on heaps of garbage and other places besides incidents of firing in various locations of Rawalpindi, including Ali Nawaz Chowk, Tipu Road, near RIC Hospital, Dhok Khabba, and Rawal Road has become a genuine concern fit air traffic. The PAF official requested the removal of cages from the rooftops.
RDA DG Kinza Murtaza clarified that the district administration and the Authority would take more steps in the Rawalpindi division and constituted a committee headed by Director Estate Management Shehzad Gondal. Shehzad informed that 80 to 85% of cages have been removed so far and more will be eliminated on the identification of the PAF.
The RDA DG directed the committee that the RWMC should immediately hold a meeting with the Cantonment Board to clear the garbage heaps from various places and improve the sanitation system.
Regarding the firing incidents, a Rawalpindi police officer informed the participants that no incident of firing has been reported so far this year.
Kinza Murtaza also directed to start of an awareness campaign regarding the danger of kite flying in public and private schools.

7,Health activists push for tougher cigarette pricing laws,Aim to prevent multinational tobacco firms from exploiting regulatory loopholes,"Health activists have demanded a tightening of laws so that multinational cigarette makers are not able to tread into the grey areas.
“No manufacturer or importer of cigarettes can introduce or sell a new cigarette brand variant at the same existing brand family at a price lower than the lowest actual price of the existing variant of the same brand family. For this restriction, the current minimum price variant of the existing brand means the lowest price of a brand variation on the day of the announcement of Budget,” Malik Imran, representative of Camp Gain for Tobacco-Free Kids, quoted the Federal Excise Act, 2005 as saying.
He said it has been observed that Pakistan Tobacco Company, a multinational subsidiary of British American Tobacco, has introduced a new product, Capstan International, at the price of Rs164. “This, prima facie, is a clear violation of the law. The existing brand is by the name of Capstan by Pall Mall, sold at Rs212,” he said.
He said no company is allowed to sell any product below the price set by the government in the Federal Excise Act 2005. Similarly, said Malik, Philip Morris International, another multinational is flagrantly violating not only the above restriction imposed under the law but also another restriction which states: “For levy, collection and payment of duty at the rates specified in column 4, against serial number 9 and 10, no cigarette manufacturer shall reduce retail price from the level adopted on the day of the announcement of the latest budget.”
Marlboro brand belonging to Philip Morris International falls in serial number 9. However, they have introduced “Crafted by Marlboro” in serial number 10 (which attracts a lower tax levy). This is specifically prohibited under the law and any attempt to use fanciful labels to bypass the law is a direct violation of the laws of Pakistan, aimed at increasing smoker numbers.
The principle behind increasing taxation is to make cigarettes more expensive; whilst these two multinationals are finding new ways of abusing Pakistani laws. Dr Hassan Shehzad, from IIUI, said, seemingly, these actions run counter to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, to which Pakistan is a signatory.
The WHO guidelines, he said, mention that “Parties (countries) should require the tobacco industry and those working to further its interests to operate and act in a manner that is accountable and transparent. The tobacco industry should be required to provide Parties with information for effective implementation of these guidelines.”
Malik Imran said it is illegal because it is avoiding tax. Tobacco expert Dr Muhammad Zia said such introduction and dissemination/marketing of the products falls in the category of promotion of the tobacco product, which is completely illegal and banned in Pakistan by law. This is an additional violation of the law. “Neither a company nor any retailer can sell cigarettes by violating federal excise law.”
