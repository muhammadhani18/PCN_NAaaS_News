He directed the finance department to prioritize funding for this purpose during a meeting held at the Chief Minister House in Peshawar.
Presiding over the meeting, Chief Minister Gandapur was joined by provincial cabinet members Syed Qasim Ali Shah, Muzammil Aslam, and Mashal Yousufzai, as well as Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry, administrative secretaries from relevant departments, and experts from the healthcare sector including Dr. Abdul Wahab Dogar, Dr. Taqi, Dr. General (retd) Pervaiz, and Dr. Mumtaz, among others. Various matters and proposals were discussed with the aim of realizing the decisions regarding the establishment of liver and bone marrow transplant centers.
This initiative marks the first-ever government-level endeavor of its kind in the province. It was decided during the meeting that initially, the liver transplant center would be set up at the Institute of Kidney Diseases in Peshawar, with plans to later relocate it to the under-construction building of Khyber Medical University.
Additionally, the meeting saw the decision to establish the first-ever Institute of Neurosurgery in the province, slated to be housed at Fountain House, Peshawar. Chief Minister Gandapur instructed the relevant authorities to finalize comprehensive plans for these proposed centers and institute, ensuring they encompass all necessary details such as manpower, funds, medical equipment, and administrative structure. He emphasized the need for viable financial plans to sustainably operate these centers.
Expressing the government’s unwavering commitment to providing liver and bone marrow transplant facilities locally, Chief Minister Gandapur emphasized that once established, these centers would eliminate the need for people within the province to seek such services elsewhere. 
He further urged authorities to ensure the availability of round-the-clock dialysis services in all government hospitals where this facility already exists, and to take necessary steps to introduce dialysis services in hospitals lacking this provision.
Highlighting the healthcare sector as a priority area for his government, Chief Minister Gandapur pledged to leverage all available resources to furnish the people of the province with quality healthcare facilities.
He made it clear that the plans must include all the details about manpower, funds, medical equipment, and administrative structure required for the centers. The chief minister further directed them to have viable financial plans to run these centers on a sustainable basis.

1,Bureaucratic upheaval expected in K-P,The PTI-SIC’s demands of transfers of key officials of the provincial bureaucracy are yet to be entertained,"With the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) backed independents securing a majority in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), and the party, which is now associated with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), assuming power for the third consecutive term in the province, significant changes in key bureaucratic positions are expected.
In this regard, Member National Assembly (MNA), Sher Afzal Marwat, a senior leader of the PTI, recently told journalists that discussions had taken place with the party’s founding Chairman, Imran Khan, who advocated for a change in key bureaucrats of the province and a change in leadership of the provincial police force. After Marwat’s presser, demands for the transfer of high-ranking police officials, including the Inspector General (IG) of K-P, Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, have intensified within the PTI ranks, which includes former ministers Taimur Jhagra and Kamran Bangash, who want an overhaul of the administrative setup of the province and the provincial capital, Peshawar. Speaking to The Express Tribune, former information minister, Bangash, said that the election was rigged with the connivance of Deputy Commissioner Peshawar and his team.
“Therefore, until these government officials are transferred, PTI’s protest will continue.” It is also pertinent to mention that recently K-P’s Chief Minister, Ali Amin Gandapur, met with the Prime Minister, Shahbaz Sharif, to discuss the transfer of the provincial police chief and other top bureaucrats.
Sources privy to the developments informed The Express Tribune that after the meeting the K-P government requested that Shahab Ali Shah, who served as the Additional Chief Secretary during former chief minister Mehmood Khan’s tenure, be appointed as the Chief Secretary of the province. While it remains to be seen whether Shah will be posted as Chief Secretary; amidst these calls for a complete upheaval, concerns regarding the lack of prioritisation of governance issues by the new government have increased. For instance, Ahmed Kundi, the Parliamentary Leader of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) in the K-P Assembly, was of the view that if the incumbent government engages in a scuffle with the federation over transfers, then there would be no time for governance.
“The government needs to address fundamental challenges facing the province, such as the demand from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reassess provincial shares and the recent controversial appointment in the Indus River System Authority,” emphasised Kundi. Similarly, Dr Ibadullah, the Opposition Leader in the K-P Assembly, highlighted a disconnect between the PTI’s current rhetoric and its previous acclaim of the province’s police force.
“In the elections of 2013 and 2018, Tehreek-e-Insaf praised K-P police as exemplary police everywhere, in every street, in every meeting. Imran Khan himself kept singing the praises of the K-P police in the 2018 rallies, but how did the police, which was apparently so good in the province for 10 years, deteriorate in 10 months?” Dr Ibadullah questioned.“
The answer is that the PTI has ruined the bureaucracy in the province. Therefore, the PTI should now focus on issues of the province, rather than making demands,” suggested Dr Ibadullah while talking to The Express Tribune.
