0,"JIT to probe attack on Chinese engineers, says info minister",Minister lauds China's unwavering support during challenging times,"Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Wednesday that a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) will be formed to probe the terrorist attack on Chinese engineers in Besham.
Addressing the media following a high-level moot of the country's top security and civil officials, the minister said the meeting recognised the imperative of a ‘coordinated strategy’ to tackle terrorism.
The high-profile meeting was attended by the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Syed Asim Munir, federal ministers, chief ministers, chief secretaries, and IGPs of the four provinces.
Tarar also said that it was decided to establish a mechanism aimed at enhancing collaboration among pertinent stakeholders.
The minister emphasized the pivotal role of security forces in the fight against terrorism and said the commitment of all forces to ""leave no stone unturned"" was applauded in the meeting.
He also condemned efforts by anti-Pakistan elements to disrupt the longstanding friendship between Pakistan and China, asserting that such attempts would be futile.
The information minister lauded China's unwavering support during challenging times, highlighting its consistent backing of Pakistan's stance on international platforms.
He underscored the critical significance of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a ""lifeline"" for economic progress, expressing Pakistan's solidarity with the Chinese people in their time of grief.
“There are standard operating procedures (SOPs) in this regard and all out steps are taken to ensure their implementation,” Tarar maintained while responding to the questions regarding the security protocols of Chinese nationals in Pakistan.

In response to queries regarding security cooperation with provincial governments, Tarar affirmed the federal government's close coordination with Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa authorities.
He disclosed PM Shehbaz's directive to CM Balochistan to expedite work on the Gwadar Safe City project - a federal funded project. Tarar said that the PM shall visit Gwadar in this regard on Thursday.
Tarar also announced plans to establish a counter-terrorism force (CTD) in K-P modeled after Punjab's ""state of the art"" CTD.
PM Shehbaz Sharif had called a meeting earlier today (Wednesday) to review the internal security situation, a day after six people, including five Chinese engineers, were killed in a terrorist attack.
A day earlier, hours after security forces successfully fended off an attack by terrorists on a Pakistan Navy base in Turbat district of Balochistan, a vehicle-borne suicide bomber targeted a convoy escorting Chinese engineers in the remote Besham area of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), killing six people.
The Chinese engineers were en route from Islamabad to their camp in Dasu – the district headquarters of the Upper Kohistan district of K-P. Their vehicle was hit by an explosives-laden vehicle, coming from the opposite direction, near Lahore Nala on the Karakoram Highway.

3,Baltimore rescuers lose hope for more survivors from bridge collapse,"'We do not believe that we're going to find any of these individuals alive,' Admiral Shannon","Rescuers have lost hope of finding more survivors of the Baltimore bridge collapse, the coast guard said, as efforts switched on Wednesday to looking for bodies of the missing and more answers to why a container ship smashed into the span.
Search divers were expected to return near dawn to the waters surrounding the twisted ruins of the bridge in Baltimore Harbor to search for six workers missing and now presumed dead.
The disaster has forced the indefinite closure of the Port of Baltimore, one of the busiest on the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, and created a traffic quagmire for Baltimore and the surrounding region.
As the odds of their survival vanished, the search for the missing workers was suspended on Tuesday evening, 18 hours after they were thrown from the fallen Francis Scott Key Bridge into the frigid waters at the mouth of the Patapsco River.
""We do not believe that we're going to find any of these individuals alive,"" Coast Guard Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath said at a briefing.
Maryland State Police and U.S. Coast Guard officials said diminished visibility and increasingly treacherous currents in the wreckage-strewn channel made continued search efforts on the river too risky to continue overnight.
Starting at six in the morning (1000 GMT) on Wednesday, ""we're hoping to put divers in the water and begin a more detailed search to do our very best to recover those six missing people,"" state police Colonel Roland Butler told reporters late on Tuesday.
Rescuers pulled two other workers from the water alive on Tuesday, and one of them was hospitalized. The six presumed to have perished included workers from Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador, according to the Mexican Consulate in Washington.
Officials said all eight were part of a work crew repairing potholes on Key Bridge's road surface when the Singapore-flagged container vessel Dali, leaving Baltimore bound for Sri Lanka, plowed into a support pylon of the bridge at about one thirty at mid night. (0530 GMT).
A trestled section of the two and half kilometers span almost immediately crumpled into the water, sending vehicles and workers into the river.
The 948-foot (289 m) ship had reported a loss of propulsion shortly before impact and dropped anchor to slow the vessel, giving transportation authorities time to halt traffic on the bridge before the crash. That move likely prevented a higher death toll, authorities said.
It was unclear whether authorities also tried to alert the work crew ahead of the impact.
Maryland Governor Wes Moore said at a Tuesday news briefing the bridge was up to code with no known structural issues. There was no evidence of foul play, officials said.
Ship's safety record
The Baltimore wreck drew attention to the vessel's safety record. The same ship was involved in an incident in the port of Antwerp, Belgium, in 2016, hitting a quay as it tried to exit the North Sea container terminal.
An inspection in 2023 carried out in Chile found ""propulsion and auxiliary machinery"" deficiencies, according to data on the public Equasis website, which provides information on ships.
But Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority said in a statement that the vessel passed two separate foreign-port inspections in June and September 2023. It said a faulty fuel pressure gauge was rectified before the vessel departed the port following its June 2023 inspection.
Video footage on social media showed the vessel slamming into the Key Bridge in darkness, the headlights of vehicles visible on the span as it crashed into the water and the ship caught fire.
All 22 crew members on the ship, owned by Grace Ocean Pte Ltd, were accounted for, its management company, Synergy Marine Pte Ltd, reported.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said closure of the port would have a ""major and protracted impact to supply chains."" The Port of Baltimore handles more automobile freight than any other U.S. port - more than 750,000 vehicles in 2022, according to port data, as well as container and bulk cargo ranging from sugar to coal.
Still, economists and logistics experts said they doubted the port closure would unleash a major U.S. supply chain crisis or major spike in the price of goods, due to ample capacity at rival shipping hubs along the Eastern Seaboard.
The loss of the bridge also snarled roadways across Baltimore, forcing motorists onto two other congested harbor crossings and raising the specter of nightmarish daily commutes and regional traffic detours for months or even years to come.
The bridge, named for the author of the Star-Spangled Banner, carries about 31,000 vehicles across the harbor daily and serves as the main route for motorists between New York and Washington seeking to avoid downtown Baltimore. It opened in 1977.
President Joe Biden promised on Tuesday to visit Baltimore, 40 miles (64 km) away, as soon as possible and said he wanted the federal government to pay to rebuild the bridge.
National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy said a team of 24 agency personnel were on the scene to investigate the accident. She said Singapore safety personnel would arrive in Baltimore on Wednesday.
Tuesday's disaster may be the worst U.S. bridge collapse since 2007, when the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis plunged into the Mississippi River, killing 13 people.

4,Water shortfall feared in summer,Shortage may hit 25% in April and May with crisis becoming severe in June," 
There is a looming threat of a waterfall shortfall in the coming summer as the shortage may hit 25% in April and May, with the crisis becoming severe in the month of June.
The snowfall was extremely low in the northern regions of the country from December 2023 till the middle of January this year.
Currently, the snowfall that accumulated in the middle of January and February this year was melting.
Sources said if it did not rain in the coming June, there could be a severe shortage of water in Tarbela and Mangla dams.
The officials of the Indus River System Authority (IRSA) have put their heads together on finding a solution to the availability of water and its distribution to the provinces during this year’s summer, convening a meeting of its advisory committee on April 2.
The sources said the water reserves in the Tarbela and Mangla dams presently stood at 300,000 and 100,000 acre-feet, respectively.
They added that the flow of water in the rivers was 70,000 cusecs while the release from the dams stood at 95,000 cusecs.
Despite the rising temperatures, the flow of water in Chenab River is extremely low.
The sources said the flow of water in Chenab River at Marala Headworks was 14,000 cusecs.
The participants of the IRSA advisory committee meeting will estimate the availability and distribution of water in the rivers.
The sources continued that they would consider the problems in water reservoirs caused by the construction of Tarbela 5th Extension project.
The meeting will be chaired by the IRSA chief.
It will be be attended by the four provincial irrigation ministers as well as Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and Meteorological Department officials,
The aim of the Tarbela 5th Extension project is to facilitate the sustainable expansion of the country’s electricity generation capacity providing a low cost, clean, renewable energy option.
The project will add a capacity of 1,410 MW, with annual electricity generation of over 1,800 GWh primarily during the summer season when demand is at its highest.
Tarbela Dam is the main source to cater to irrigational needs of Sindh, Punjab, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Last year, Tarbela Dam reached its peak capacity, attaining a level of 1,550 feet above sea level.
Tarbela Dam has a live water storage capacity of 5.809 million acre-feet with an installed capacity of 4,888 MW. This will further increase to 6,418 MW after the completion of the Tarbela 5th Extension Project.

7,"Rifts emerge in PML-N, PPPP on IRSA appointment","PMLN, PPPP show signs of strain in first month into power"," 
The ruling coalition has started showing signs of strains in the first month into power as the leaders of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarian (PPPP) came face-to-face on Tuesday on the contentious appointment of a retired bureaucrat as the new chairman of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa).
The counter statements from the leaders of the PML-N and PPPP, the main partners in the federal government, has brought to fore cracks in the ruling coalition just days after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, first, appointed Zafar Mahmood as the new Irsa chairman and, then, hurriedly withdrew his decision after seeing strong opposition from the PPPP.
Though both the parties entered into an alliance and formed the government in the Centre on the heels of a split mandate given to political parties in the February 8 general elections, the tone and tenor of the statements issued from both sides not just indicate rifts between them but also raise questions about the stability of the coalition.
Although PTI-backed independent candidates won majority seats of the National Assembly in the general elections, PML-N’s Shehbaz became prime minister only after PPPP gave him votes in exchange for some constitutional offices, including the office of the president.
Though PPPP decided that it would not become a part of the federal cabinet, distribution of key constitutional positions between them had led to the formation of coalition government, which has started shaking in its first month into power.
“It is written in the Irsa law that the provinces will be consulted on the appointment of the chairman,” PPP’s central spokesperson Shazia Marri said in a statement released by the party and posted on X, formerly Twitter.
“Even if there is no law, even then the allies should be consulted,” the PPP spokesperson said. “PML-N wants PPPP’s vote for free and if they expect us to put a stamp on their illegal activities,” Marri stated, “they are living in a fool’s paradise”.
The PPP spokesperson’s statement has come in response to a statement of PML-N leader, Rana Sanaullah, who criticised PPPP over Irsa chairman’s appointment issue in a TV talk show.
When asked whether the PML-N-PPP coalition would last for five years or if the PML-N could be sidelined by the PPP after a couple of years, Sanaullah said one could not predict the future. However, the PPP's immediate reaction to the appointment of Irsa chairman at the beginning of the coalition suggested that the partners were primarily interested in portraying themselves as the righteous ones.
Sanaullah, who served as the interior minister in the last PML-N government, stated that his party would endeavour to maintain a positive trajectory with its allies, emphasising the unpredictability of future outcomes.
In response to PM Shehbaz’s decision to withdraw the Irsa chairman’s notification, the PML-N leader remarked that if party supremo Nawaz Sharif were the prime minister, he would have communicated to the other party that a decision had already been made.
He said Nawaz would have suggested both sides to wait for some time, as it would be inappropriate to issue a notification in the morning and withdraw it in the afternoon.
However, Sanaullah stated that PM Shehbaz consistently demonstrated his magnanimity, adding that he could provide several examples of the incumbent premier successfully managing similar situations while leading the 13-party alliance during his previous tenure.
“He [PM Shehbaz] will still face such issues but there comes a point where one has to take a stand,” Sanaullah said.
Things would have been different had PPPP requested the prime minister to change his decision without resorting to protest, he added.
Sanaullah, however, said immediately resorting to protest, issuing statements to media and making hue and cry over the appointment lead to criticism among the parties and does not politically look good among the coalition partners.
During his interview, Sanaullah emphasised that PM Shehbaz had to engage in politics with the help of the party.
The rift over Irsa chairman’s appointment is not the first issue where the two sides have publically differed with each other as, recently, PPPP objected to the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) demand during talks with government that Pakistan should revisit the National Finance Commission (NFC) formula, wondering why the global lender would push the Center to encroach on provincial share.

8,Allegations of judicial interference spark calls for probe,"Bar associations throw weight behind IHC judges, call for probe"," 
A legal storm appeared to be brewing on Wednesday after calls for a thorough investigation surged in the wake of explosive allegations made by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), accusing the country’s intelligence agencies of meddling in judicial affairs.
Bar associations across the country rallied behind the judges, sounding the alarm over the alleged threat to judicial independence amid fears that recent court rulings, handed down in the charged political climate, were thrust into doubts.
Meanwhile, against the backdrop of escalating clamour for inquiry, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa convened a full court meeting of the Supreme Court’s judges.
A meeting was also held between the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP), Mansoor Awan, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and CJP Isa.
The judicial trio discussed the letter by the six IHC judges.Throwing its weight behind the judges, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) reiterated its ""unwavering support for the judiciary as an institution and for the Honorable Judges of the Islamabad High Court"".
The apex body of jurists underscored the gravity of the allegations, emphasising the need for decisive action from the judiciary.The SCBAP not only condemned the alleged interference but also stated that it ""requires serious actions by the judiciary as an institution"".
SCBA President Shahzad Shaukat issued a statement expressing deep concern over the purported interference, stating, “Such issues should be addressed in a befitting manner.”
He further stressed, “bar associations, particularly the SCBA, will not tolerate any incidents aimed at undermining the independence, integrity, authority and functioning of judicial institutions.”In a letter addressed to CJP Isa, SCBA Additional Secretary Sardar Shahbaz Ali Khosa urged immediate action under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, advocating for a transparent hearing of the case.
Khosa highlighted recent crackdowns on journalists and media outlets reporting on the alleged interferences, urging the CJP to delve into the matter.
Echoing similar sentiments, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) demanded a transparent inquiry into the allegations, urging legal repercussions for those implicated.The association, in a press release following an emergency meeting, condemned the intrusion of one institution into the affairs of another.

Moreover, it called for unwavering commitment to independent decision-making within the judiciary, commending the courage of the six IHC judges who brought these allegations to light.In a synchronised response, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) demanded swift action against implicated intelligence agencies and personnel.
It condemned the alleged interference as a grave threat to the rule of law and judicial independence.Expressing disappointment in the handling of the situation by both current and former CJPs, the LHCBA urged CJP Isa to foster an environment conducive to justice without fear or favour.
Meanwhile, the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) proposed the formation of a judicial commission to investigate the allegations thoroughly.
The association stressed the need for institutional mechanisms to safeguard judicial independence and strengthen accountability within the judiciary.Similarly, the Balochistan Bar Council and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council (KPBC) echoed concerns over the alleged interference, with the KPBC emphasizing the judges' duty to act against such intrusion into judicial affairs.
In a statement, KPBC Vice-Chairman Sadiq Ali Mohmand deemed the allegations a ""worrisome development,"" emphasising the judiciary's role in upholding the rule of law and defending the Constitution.
SC asked to form commission
Advocate Mian Dawood, in a separate move, approached the Supreme Court urging the immediate establishment of a high-power inquiry commission to investigate the allegations.He emphasised the need for ""strict action be taken or directed against all those found guilty of the misconduct in result of the probe"".
Dawood singled out the law, defence, and interior ministries, along with the Islamabad High Court and the six IHC judges, as respondents in the case.He argued that the judges' letter ""seemed to be an attempt to shaken to [sic] confidence of the public on the judiciary and to weakening [sic] the independence of the judiciary"".
Highlighting concerns, the petition noted that the letter ""gave the impression that the executive and the ISI is interested in influencing"" cases related to Imran, citing instances where the IHC had provided relief to him.
Furthermore, the plea pointed out that the judges' letter ""seemed to be a designed move because as soon as the letter emerged on national media, the PTI leaders, workers and trolls started campaigning on social media"" against Justice Farooq, CJP Isa, and other judges.
The petition raised alarm over the public scrutiny faced by the Pakistan Army and the judiciary due to the judges' letter.Arguing against this backdrop, the petition highlighted that a ""campaign"" was initiated against the CJP and other SC judges whenever the apex court ""heard and passed strict orders in the cases of Bahria Town (Pvt) Ltd"".

9,Asif points finger at Kabul for terror surge,Defence minister underscores urgent need for fundamental changes in functionality of Pakistan-Afghan borders,"In the wake of the recent surge in terrorist activities across Pakistan, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has pointed fingers at Afghanistan, labeling it as the primary source of terrorism within the country.
The minister made these remarks in a post on the microblogging platform 'X' on Wednesday, underscoring the urgent need for fundamental changes in the functionality of the Pakistan-Afghan borders amidst escalating terrorism activities.
دھشت گردی کے واقعات میں اضافہ کے پیش نظر بارڈر کہ صورتحال میں بنیادی تبدیلی کی ضرورت ھے۔ پاکستان میں دھشت گردی کا منبہ افغانستان میں ھے اور باوجود ھماری کوششوں کے کابل اس سمت کوئی پیش رفت نہیں کر رہا بلکہ دھشت گردی کے ٹھکانے انکے علم میں ھونے کے باوجود انکی سر زمین سے پاکستان کے…
Asif's statement follows the devastating Bisham suicide bombing, which claimed the lives of six individuals, including five Chinese nationals, just a day prior in Pakistan. The victims, Chinese engineers traveling from Islamabad to their camp in Dasu, fell victim to an explosives-laden vehicle attack near Lahore Nala on the Karakoram Highway, coming from the opposite direction.
Expressing frustration at the lack of progress from Kabul, despite being aware of the presence and activities of terrorists within its borders, Asif highlighted the alarming situation where terrorists are operating freely against Pakistan.

He said while other traditional borders adhere to international rules, the Pak-Afghan border stands as a unique case, necessitating Pakistan's adherence to international regulations in the face of Kabul's non-cooperation.
Furthermore, Asif stressed the importance of halting the cross-border movement of terrorists, citing it as imperative for fostering positive relations between the neighbouring nations. He reiterated that citizens from both sides should be allowed to travel with valid visas and passports, emphasising the need for cooperation and mutual understanding between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
