1,"Rising inflation restricts sale, purchase of footwear",Shopkeepers report more than 50% decline in business this Ramazan,"Ahead of Eid-ul-Fitr the prices of traditional footwear such as shoes, chappals, and Peshawari chappals, have witnessed a steep rise, attributed largely to inflationary pressures. Shopkeepers report a decline in consumer purchasing power, resulting in a more than 50 per cent drop in sales of various types of footwear this Ramazan. The average buyer now opts for more affordable options, particularly slippers and shoes priced between Rs1,000 and Rs1,500, mindful of budget constraints.
The Express Tribune has conducted a survey to find out the sale and purchase trends this Ramazan.
Babu Khan, a chappal maker and shopkeeper, underscored the profound impact of current economic challenges on consumer spending during Eid. Sales of various footwear types, including Peshawari chappals, Kheri, cut shoes, kolhapuri, nagra, chappals, and khussay, have witnessed a decline of 30 to 40 per cent.
Khan says that people now prefer to purchase new footwear only when their current ones are no longer serviceable, with most preferring affordable options priced between Rs1,000 and Rs1,500. Premium footwear remains a choice primarily for the affluent, while the middle and lower classes gravitate towards stalls and bargain markets for their purchases.
Ameen Khan, a Peshawari chappal maker points to the availability of two types of leather in Pakistan, emphasising the cost disparities. He notes a significant increase in the prices of materials and chemicals used in the leather dyeing process, resulting in a scarcity of resources in the market. This shortage has led to the adoption of local alternatives, albeit at prices surging by 250 per cent compared to the previous year. Consequently, prices of shoes and slippers have witnessed a notable increase of 50 to 70 per cent compared to last year.
Sharjeel Ahmed, a chappal trader, highlighted a decline in demand for various types of chappals and shoes during Ramazan, attributing it to exorbitant prices exceeding the purchasing power of the public. This has led to a 60 per cent decrease in custom-made footwear orders, with consumers now favouring readymade options.
Ahmed Khan, another Peshawari chappal merchant, enumerates the diverse range of Peshawari chappal designs available in the market, catering to different preferences and ethnic backgrounds. He noteed efforts by shopkeepers to clear last year's stock at discounted prices to maximise returns on investments.
Sharjeel Ahmed spoke about the diverse manufacturing landscape of Karachi, where chappals and kheri are produced in various localities, catering to different linguistic and cultural preferences. He elaborates on the specific designs preferred by different ethnic groups, highlighting Karachi's cultural diversity.
Tariq, a vendor specialising in kheri and chappals, discussed the extensive range of footwear available in the market, emphasising the varying price ranges based on materials and designs. He noted a growing preference for locally produced rubber slippers, given the ban on imports, with prices ranging from Rs600 to Rs4,000.
Abdullah mentioned a high demand for cut shoes during Eid-ul-Fitr, particularly among men, youth, and children, with prices ranging from Rs1,200 to Rs4,000 for locally produced varieties.
Amin Babu expressed concern over the shortage of skilled artisans in crafting high-end footwear, attributing it to waning interest among the younger generation. He highlighted the prevalence of small-scale cottage industries in producing ordinary slippers and shoes, with artisans receiving minimal compensation for their work.
