0,Turkmenistan concerned over delay in TAPI pipeline,Oil minister stresses Pakistan’s commitment to advancing project,"The ambassador of Turkmenistan has expressed concern over delay in implementation of the long overdue Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project, officials say.
Turkmenistan and other participating countries including Afghanistan, Pakistan and India have already signed a commercial deal pertaining to gas sale and purchase decades ago. However, since then, there has been no progress on the critical energy scheme, particularly for Pakistan which regularly faces gas scarcity, despite assurances from the Afghan Taliban rulers that they would extend full support to the project. Central Asian states have been supplying electricity to Afghanistan since long but the Taliban have not attacked any such installations.
At a meeting with Turkmenistan Ambassador Atadjan Movlamov, Petroleum Minister Dr Musadik Malik emphasised that Pakistan remained steadfast in its commitment to advancing the TAPI project. The minister praised the ambassador’s support and pledged to uphold the partnership between the two countries. Calling TAPI a flagship project, he said Pakistan was committed to completing work on the pipeline. Notably, during his previous stint, the project saw unprecedented momentum, which resulted in significant progress and tangible outcomes. Looking ahead, he vowed to advance the project and avoid losing momentum. The ambassador told the minister that inter-governmental commission and working group meetings were scheduled to be held this year.

“TAPI is a win-win project for all parties,” he remarked and invited Pakistan to attend an energy forum being hosted by Turkmenistan in Paris. Earlier, the TAPI project started suffering delays when Pakistan asked Turkmenistan for gas price revision during the tenure of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government. However, Turkmenistan refused to revise gas prices, arguing that it would also have to provide justification to other countries like Afghanistan and India, which may seek price revision as well. Later, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government also took up the matter with Turkmenistan. So far, no progress has been made on the price revision request.
The prolonged delay sparked suspicions that the pipeline project may eventually come to a halt as Pakistan had become more dependent on LNG imports. Three key players including Qatar, Iran and Turkmenistan are vying for a larger slice of the international gas market. Of these, Qatar is a leading exporter of LNG to Pakistan. Pakistan has been working on Iran-Pakistan and TAPI gas pipeline projects since long. Iran had planned to supply gas from its South Pars field, which is situated along the Iran-Qatar border.
Qatar is also extracting gas from this joint field and selling it to different customers including Pakistan whereas Iran is under US sanctions, which have barred it from executing the IP project.
Industry officials reveal that US companies are working with Qatari firms on gas extraction and sale to different countries in the form of LNG.
Earlier, USAID had extended legal support to Pakistan for striking an LNG deal with Qatar in 2015. Washington has also provided its backing for the TAPI project, which will divert Turkmen gas from Russia to Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. At present, Russia is taking gas supplies from Turkmenistan and selling them to Europe. Moreover, TAPI will emerge as an energy corridor that will connect three rival countries.
Even Russia is in favour of the TAPI pipeline, which it wants to use for gas supply to Pakistan, India and other neighbouring countries.

1,Rupee extends rising streak into 9th day,"The currency has cumulatively gained 10.41%, or Rs28.95, in the past six and a half months","Pakistani currency notched up fresh gains for the eighth consecutive working day on Monday, rising to a new five-month high at Rs278.12 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market in the wake of higher supply of the foreign currency compared to its demand.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the rupee inched up Rs0.02 on a day-on-day basis against the greenback.
The currency has cumulatively gained 10.41%, or Rs28.95, in the past six and a half months compared to the all-time low close of Rs307.10/$ recorded in the first week of September 2023.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported that the local currency closed unchanged at Rs280.73/$ in the open market for the second successive working day.
Market talk suggests that achievement of a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the release of third and last loan tranche of $1.1 billion has encouraged other global financial institutions including the World Bank to unlock financing for different projects in Pakistan.
The inflows will help the country keep foreign exchange reserves at stable levels despite continuous repayment of the maturing foreign debt.
More importantly, the reserves have continued to improve over the past two consecutive weeks, reaching a five-week high at $8.02 billion in the week ended March 15, 2024.

2,HCSTSI chief decries poor infrastructure,"Calls for public-private partnerships, and urgent action on canal pollution","Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry (HCSTSI) President Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani has called for measures to modernise Hyderabad’s infrastructure, aiming to foster sustainable growth in both industrial and residential areas. He stressed the need for public-private partnerships to revolutionise urban development.
In a statement on Tuesday, Shaikhani urged the government to adopt innovative approaches for progress, discarding outdated methods. He highlighted the poor road infrastructure as a hindrance to the growth of Sindh’s second-largest city after Karachi. Despite long-standing complaints from businesspeople about injustice and inadequate facilities, no action has been taken.
Shaikhani raised concerns about canal pollution due to sewage contamination, attributing it to insufficient planning within the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) Hyderabad. Issuing a warning he said that contaminated water from the River Indus and the canal system poses serious health risks to people and livestock, urging immediate remedial action.

Additionally, Shaikhani addressed a letter to Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, urging revolutionary actions to address the challenges faced by WASA Hyderabad. Highlighting statistics revealed by WASA during a crucial meeting with the Caretaker former Chief Minister of Sindh, Justice (R) Maqbool Baqir, and Caretaker former Provincial Minister for Local Government, Mubeen Jumani, Shaikhani noted that Hyderabad has 2,500 contractual employees, many of whom are considered ‘ghost’ workers. Furthermore, a staggering number of over 50,000 water supply connections of WASA are unlawfully utilised in the city. Shaikhani advocated for a transformative approach, suggesting the replacement of ‘ghost’ employees with private workers for a more efficient sewerage system.
He also proposed implementing a biometric attendance system to meticulously monitor employee presence, thereby eliminating ‘ghost’ workers from the system.

3,Energy supply chain under threat,PSO seeks payment of outstanding dues of Rs550 billion for LNG supply,"Pakistan State Oil (PSO) has warned that the country’s entire energy supply chain may get disrupted as circular debt is uncontrollably rising in sales of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
In a letter written to the managing director of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), oil marketing giant PSO said that outstanding dues against the sale of LNG to the public gas utility had gone up to alarming levels, which could threaten the smooth functioning of the entire energy chain.
“This is in continuation to the numerous letters and correspondences relating to outstanding payment against supply of LNG; it is of great concern that payments against LNG supplies from SNGPL have been alarmingly low since the start of fiscal year 2024 and resulted in a net increase of Rs49 billion in PSO’s receivables,” the PSO management said.
At present, PSO’s total receivables from SNGPL stand at Rs550 billion. “We would like to reiterate that PSO’s cash flow situation is deteriorating rapidly due to continued default in payments by SNGPL and PSO is incurring huge financial charges on financing the growing receivables,” the oil marketing company said.
“Owing to this situation, PSO is facing a serious liquidity crunch which may lead to the disruption of the country’s energy supply chain.”
The management of PSO requested the gas utility to immediately clear the entire outstanding dues of Rs550 billion for LNG supplies, by employing all the available options, in order to ensure uninterrupted energy supply in the country.

PSO is a key importer of LNG from Qatar and supplies it to SNGPL to meet the requirement of varying consumers.
During the previous winter, SNGPL diverted LNG to domestic consumers following directives from the federal government to overcome energy crisis, mainly in Punjab, which had very low local gas production.
The cost of diverting LNG to domestic consumers has been estimated at $1 billion to address the shortages anticipated in fiscal year 2024-25.
State-owned gas entities are already reeling from the circular debt that has piled up to Rs710 billion, primarily due to LNG supply.
Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) shoulders a circular debt of Rs142 billion, while PSO grapples with a debt burden of Rs568 billion, all stemming from the supply of re-gasified LNG to state-owned gas utilities.
It was revealed by the key stakeholders recently. The All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) North Zone, at a public hearing conducted in Lahore, asserted that the diversion of RLNG to domestic consumers was feared to cost a staggering $1 billion in financial year 2024-25, accounting for 209 million cubic feet of gas per day (mmcfd).
SNGPL has projected diversion of 80,155 British thermal units of RLNG to its consumers in 2024-25 at a cost of Rs297,913 million, equivalent to $1 billion, which has been approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) and ratified by the federal cabinet.
The circular debt in RLNG chain has been on the rise because of prolonged delay in application of the weighted average cost of gas.
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government had got approved the weighted average cost of gas bill from parliament but it was challenged in Sindh High Court.
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has applied the weighted average cost partially, but it has not been fully implemented. Therefore, the amount of $1 billion would either be recovered from consumers or it would be added to the circular debt.
Meanwhile, SNGPL is seeking a massive increase in gas prices, effective from July 1, 2024, to meet the company’s revenue requirement.

4,Minister urges speedy work on Gwadar plant,Said supply of electricity is essential in Gwadar and no delay will be accepted,"Minister for Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives Professor Ahsan Iqbal directed the authorities concerned on Tuesday to expedite the construction work on the Gwadar Power Plant. The minister issued these directives while chairing a meeting to review the progress of the Gwadar Power Plant. The meeting was attended by ministry officials, the Managing Director of the Private Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB), the Chinese Minister-Counsellor Yang Guangyuan, and other relevant stakeholders, as per a news release.
The PPIB is processing the 300MW coal power project at Gwadar, being developed by M/s CIHC Pak Power Company (Pvt) Limited (CPPCL). The project holds paramount importance for the energy infrastructure and economic development of the region and is on the ‘priority list’ of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). “The supply of electricity is essential in Gwadar and no delay will be accepted,” said the minister, directing the concerned stakeholders to remove all bottlenecks and start the construction work immediately.

Referring to Gwadar as ‘the gateway of CPEC,’ the minister noted that the incumbent government had expedited the implementation of phase 2 of the CPEC while integrating it with five new economic corridors. “The development of Gwadar Port City, New Gwadar International Airport, and East Bay Expressway is poised to transform the city of Gwadar into a maritime trade hub and a new smart port for the region. It will also lead to industrialisation in Balochistan,” he added.
Expressing confidence in the projects under CPEC in Gwadar, including the Gwadar Power Plant, distribution of 2000 Boat engines to fishermen of Gwadar, Khuzdar-Panjgur Transmission line, New Gwadar International Airport Project, the China-Pak Friendship Hospital, among others, the minister envisioned them as a shining pearl in the region.

5,"PSX extends gains, nears 66,000 mark","KSE-100 index rises 380.63 points, settles at 65,906.28","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday continued its bullish momentum as it extended gains from the previous session, primarily fuelled by a surge in stock valuations in oil and banking sectors.
Though trading commenced with the intra-day low of 65,492.70 points, the KSE-100 index gradually climbed upwards later. The positive trajectory got support from different factors including surging global equities, stability of the Pakistani rupee amid robust foreign currency inflows, and elevated global crude oil prices.
Although certain stocks registered losses, the positive performance from fertiliser, banking and cement sectors aided the overall bullish sentiment. The market maintained its upward march for almost throughout the session and reached the intra-day high of 65,989.54 towards the end of trading.
Eventually, the KSE-100 index closed near the 66,000 level with gains of nearly 400 points. “Stocks closed higher, led by oil and banking shares on strong valuations,” said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.
“Surging global stocks, rupee stability amid foreign inflows and higher global crude oil prices played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.” At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 380.63 points, or 0.58%, and settled at 65,906.28.

Topline Securities, in its report, said that Tuesday’s trading session at the Pakistan stock market concluded at 65,906, marking a 0.58%, or 381-point, increase.
Contributing positively to the index were fertiliser, banking and cement sectors, with Fauji Fertiliser, Meezan Bank, United Bank, Lucky Cement, and Engro Corp collectively adding 305 points.
Conversely, Engro Fertilisers, Bank Alfalah and MCB Bank incurred losses totalling 51 points, it noted.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its review, wrote that the PSX knocked on the 66,000 mark again, which had been tested in six sessions since the start of March. “Bias remains for an eventual breach and moves towards new highs,” it said.
“The index is currently looking poised to breach 66,000 this week and see accelerated gains,” AHL said, adding that 58 shares rose while 33 fell with Fauji Fertiliser (+4.31%), Meezan Bank (+3.62%) and United Bank (+1.39%) being the biggest contributors to the index gains.
Pakistan International Airlines surged 7.5% following the approval of its board for the restructuring and privatisation of the airline.
AHL said that FTSE would release the fixed income and equity country classification review of markets on Wednesday after the close of US markets where Pakistan was on the watch list for potential demotion, from secondary emerging to frontier market status. JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala observed that the KSE-100 index saw a positive movement, gaining 381 points day-on-day to close at 65,906.
“Looking ahead, it may be wise for investors to consider a buy-on-dips strategy, especially focusing on banking, exploration and production, and technology sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 303.7 million shares against Monday’s tally of 261.2 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs12.1 billion.
Shares of 336 companies were traded. Of these, 173 stocks closed higher, 144 dropped and 19 remained unchanged.
Pakistan International Airlines Corp was the volume leader with trading in 30.3 million shares, gaining Rs1.77 to close at Rs25.39.

6,Local cement dispatches likely to surge 10-14%,Year-on-year decline of 3% to 7% projected,"Local cement dispatches across Pakistan are projected to increase by 10% to 14% for March 2024. Total dispatches are expected to reach around 3.20 million tonnes on a month-on-month (MoM) basis, with a projected decline of 3% to 7% on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.
In February 2024, cement sales remained low, primarily due to the election month, during which every sector anxiously awaited the election process and its results. Local cement dispatches in February 2024 were 2.86 million tonnes compared to the five-year average dispatches of 3.61 million tonnes in February.
Based on these sales figures, the average daily domestic sales for the sector are expected to reach 103.1 thousand tonnes/day in March 2024, which is still lower than the five-year average March sales of 127.1 thousand tonnes/day. The YoY decline in local cement dispatches is attributed to a slowdown in construction activities due to higher construction input costs and the high base effect of the previous year, when cement dispatches increased due to flood-related construction activities. The implementation of axle load regulations, which caused issues in transporting cement, was another reason for declining cement dispatches.
Read Cement dispatches decline 19.22%
Exports during March 2024 are anticipated to increase by 25-29% YoY and 39-43% MoM, reaching 0.56 million tonnes. This growth in exports is mainly attributed to Lucky Cement, as the company recently secured export orders mostly from African countries. This brings Pakistan’s total cement sales to around 3.75 million tonnes in March 2024, remaining flat YoY and increasing by 13-17% MoM.
Total cement capacity utilisation in March 2024 is estimated to be 55%, compared to 48% in February 2024 and 61% in March 2023.
In the first nine months of FY24, total cement sales are likely to increase by around 1-3% YoY, with local sales expected to decline by 3-5% YoY and exports to increase by 66-68% YoY. The average retail price in March 2024 increased by Rs10 per bag to Rs1,205 per bag in the South, while it decreased by Rs6 per bag to Rs1,239 per bag in the North, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS).
“Based on 9M2023 cement sales, we expect local sales to remain flat YoY at 40 million tonnes, down from our earlier estimate of 5% growth in FY24, while we believe export sales will continue their momentum. Consequently, we expect total cement dispatches to clock in at 47 million tons, up 5% YoY in FY24,” said Topline Securities in its report.

7,PIA board approves privatisation plan amid IMF talks,"Commits to govt target of June 2024 for sell-off, aims to fetch $250-300m","The board of directors of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has approved the government’s plan to privatise the national flag carrier ahead of the country securing a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme, estimating to fetch $250-300 million through the sell-off likely to a Middle Eastern country.
Following its reconstitution on Friday, March 22, the board of directors convened its first meeting on Monday and committed to the government’s timeline to privatise PIA by June 15, 2024.
Some meeting participants expressed confidence that PIA’s sell-off would occur before the country secures the next IMF loan package. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is expected to formally approach the IMF for a new loan programme at the Fund’s annual meeting in mid-April 2024.
However, a source dispelled the impression that PIA privatisation is a prerequisite condition for the IMF’s next loan programme.
The PIA board formally approved the appointment of international financial advisor, Ernst & Young, for the privatisation transaction.
According to a source familiar with the developments surrounding the airline’s sell-off, the advisor’s briefing to the board projected that PIA’s privatisation may fetch $250-300 million for the government.
However, the actual value of PIA may differ once interested buyers conduct due diligence of the national carrier.
Read EASA clearance to sweeten PIA sell-off
Progress on the airline’s privatisation front suggests that potential buyers for the national carrier have already expressed their intention to purchase it. They may belong to a Middle Eastern country such as the United Arab Emirate (UAE) or Qatar, the source opined.
In a notification to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday, PIA Company Secretary Rao Muhammad Imran stated, “the board of directors of the company in its 83rd meeting held on March 25, 2024 (Monday) has approved the Scheme of Arrangement (SOA) for restructuring and privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited along with its ancillary modalities, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).”
The source noted that this was the first meeting of the PIA board following its reconstitution. The newly appointed board endorsed the government’s decisions on the PIA sell-off, as PIA board approval is necessary to proceed with the Privatisation Commission’s plan in line with governing laws.
He said, the board approved all the 30 to 40 steps and procedures related to PIA sell-off. Some, such as the appointment of the international financial advisor Ernst & Young, had already taken place before the board’s reconstitution.
However, selling PIA in a government-to-government or government-to-private sector deal is not as straightforward as projected, said the source. The airline may find a new owner (for 51% stake with management control) by the given deadline (June 15, 2024) only if all procedures are introduced on time and proceed smoothly.
Successfully culminating the privatisation process entails a lot of work, including PIA restructuring, which involves bifurcating the company into two parts. One would hold the core operations of the airline up for sale, while a holding company would manage the debt and liabilities of the airline, including a domestic commercial loan of Rs243 billion and a foreign loan of $88 million.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, PIA Spokesperson Abdullah Hafeez Khan stated that the board meeting lasted about two-and-a-half to three hours.
He contradicted reports that the board of directors discussed an early retirement plan, Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS), or golden handshake.
He affirmed that the board has committed to implementing the government’s privatisation plan in full compliance and would play its role in achieving the airline’s privatisation on time. PIA has been in the headlines regarding its privatisation for over a decade. Some quarters and political parties in parliament, however, do not find it fitting to sell the loss-making national carrier to a new owner.
The IMF has urged different governments to sell their loss-making assets to halt injecting around half a trillion rupees into them each year with no benefit. The resources spent on them could be diverted to productive projects.
Meanwhile, the federal government is set to provide preferential treatment to two domestic banks and is willing to take responsibility for their $88 million foreign currency lending to PIA without any restructuring.
The handling of the foreign currency loan contrasts with the restructuring of PIA’s Rs243 billion domestic debt, which is being extended for 10 years at reduced interest rates.
Government sources informed The Express Tribune that this decision will impose an additional burden on the exchequer in the shape of high interest rates in dollar terms and exchange rate risks over the next five years.
Out of the $88 million, NBP lent $74 million, and HBL’s share was $14 million. The government is considering partially settling the $88 million, with the remaining $53 million to be managed by the government holding company.
