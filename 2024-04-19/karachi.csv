0,Plea for security of Imran Khan in Adiala Jail disposed of,A two-judge bench disposed of the petition seeking safety and security of the PTI founder at the Adiala Jail.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday directed the authorities to ensure security of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan and all other prisoners in accordance with law.
A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi disposed of the petition seeking safety and security of the PTI founder at the Adiala Jail.
A federal law officer filed a reply on behalf of the interior secretary.
The ministry of interior in its comments stated that the matter pertaining to imposing a ban on meetings of PTI leaders with Mr Khan at the Adiala Jail was related to the Punjab government.
The interior ministry claimed that as per credible sources, hostile intelligence agencies and terrorist outfits had been planning to exploit heightened political polarisation in the country to their advantage.
The tentacles of these elements had been mobilised and asked to target premises/personalities in Rawalpindi while it had also been learnt that the terrorists had identified Adiala Jail, key military installations and police lines in Rawalpindi as primary targets, it added.
In view of the sensitivity of the matter, the ministry maintained that directions had been issued to respective provincial authorities for making foolproof security arrangements for the likely targets to avert the possibility of any untoward incident.
Every citizen had right to safety and security as enshrined in the Constitution and security arraignments were being made by the respective provincial government in accordance with the threat level, it concluded.
After taking the comments on record, the bench directed the authorities concerned to provide security to the PTI founder and other prisoners in accordance with law.
It also said that the petitioner was at liberty to approach the relevant forum in case of further grievances.
At the last hearing, the SHC had also directed all the authorities concerned to take necessary steps to secure the lives of prisoners, including former prime minister confined at the Adiala Jail.
Petitioner Abdul Wahab Baloch had submitted that he was the president of Insaf Lawyers Forum Sindh, the legal wing of PTI, and added that the party’s founder had been implicated in politically motivated cases and currently incarcerated at Central Prison Rawalpindi (Adiala Jail).
Citing the federation through the ministry of interior as respondent, he contended that a ban had been imposed by the jail authorities on meetings with the ex-PM on the pretext that he had serious life threats and some terrorists had been arrested around/near the detention facility with explosive material.
The petitioner also argued that according to the Constitution, the federation was responsible for ensuring the safety and security of all individuals/citizens of Pakistan, including the detained founder of the PTI and asked the SHC to issue directive to the respondents to ensure safety and security of Mr Khan at the detention facility.

1,‘Incomplete’ Indus Highway claims lives of 115 people in four years,"132-km-long dual carriageway from Jamshoro to Sehwan yet to be completed, seven years on.
• NHA assures Sindh CS it will","• 132-km-long dual carriageway from Jamshoro to Sehwan yet to be completed, seven years on
• NHA assures Sindh CS it will complete the project by June                
HYDERABAD: As many as 115 people were killed and 317 injured in a total of 97 traffic accidents on an incomplete section of the Indus Highway between Jamshoro and Sehwan during the last four years, officials said on Thursday.
On early Wednesday morning, six persons were killed and over three dozen injured when a coach ploughed into an oil tanker near Sehwan on the same Indus Highway. 
Following the deadly accident, the Sindh government once again asked the federal government to complete the much-delayed project, being undertaken by the National Highway Authority (NHA), as early as possible.
The 130-kilometre-long dual carriageway of the Indus Highway, known as N-55, remained incomplete between Jamshoro and Sehwan despite the fact that the Rs14 billion road project was launched in December 2017 and the Sindh government had already provided Rs7bn as its 50 per cent share of the project’s cost.
The Sindh police had said that as many as 282 people were killed and 1,443 injured in 608 accidents on the same section of the Indus Highway during 2017 and 2018.
Sehwan is the hometown of Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and the Indus Highway passes through his constituency as well. He had time and again called for the completion of the road section and once wondered why the federal government had failed to complete the 130-km-long carriageway in years when the Sindh government had completed 62-km-long Nawabshah-Sanghar Road in just four months.
‘10 dangerous turns causing accidents’
On Thursday, Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah chaired a high-level meeting in Hyderabad to review the progress of the Indus Highway construction work. 
The meeting was attended by the secretaries of the local government and works and services departments, Hyderabad commissioner, officials of the NHA and motorway police.
Expressing concerns over the increasing number of fatal accidents on the said section of the Indus Highway, the CS said that since 2019 as many as 97 accidents had taken place on the highway in which 115 people were killed and 317 suffered injuries.
Briefing the CS, Motorway DIG Muhammad Saleem said that there were 10 dangerous sharp turns on the Indus Highway.
He attributed accidents with engineering design faults and informed the meeting that the motorway police had already approached the NHA in this regard.
The CS deplored the delay in construction of the highway and held the NHA responsible for failing to complete the construction work within stipulated time. 
He regretted that precious lives were being lost due to non-completion of the road.
Mr Shah said that the Sindh chief minister had approached the prime minister about the delay in completion of the project following the Wednesday deadly accident.
Briefing the meeting, NHA officials said that the dual carriageway would be completed by June 2024.
The chief secretary directed the NHA to keep in mind the heavy rains of 2022 in the area while undertaking the project and proposed construction of culverts in the carriageway.
He asked the motorway police to increase number of patrols and set up control room to monitor the traffic with cameras.

4,The rain that never came,The city remained on the edge throughout the day as recent videos of the heaviest recorded rainfall in Dubai did the rounds on social media.,"KARACHI: A day of anxiety and panic in Karachi was over when the fear surrounding the chances of ‘heavy rains’, mostly over social media, faded away leaving only traces in the city on Thursday.
Due to the past bad experiences, the city remained on the edge throughout the day amid recent images and videos of the heaviest recorded rainfall in Dubai doing the rounds.
 
 

A senior Met official confirmed that the system which entered the south of the country on Wednesday had finally fizzled out after showering drizzle in Karachi and moderate rains to a few parts of rural Sindh.
The system, he said, could still affect Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Upper Punjab.
“The system has subsided and almost fizzled out from entire Sindh,” said Dr Sardar Sarfaraz, the Chief Meteorologist of Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).

The weather ‘system’ had caused heavy rains in Oman and UAE, says chief meteorologist

“It didn’t cause much rains in Karachi as different areas of the city only witnessed traces of downpour. It was the same system which caused heavy rains in Oman and UAE. With fast-changing and developing conditions, the Met office lately predicted that Karachi was expected to receive only light rain or showers.”
The maximum temperature recorded on Thursday was 31.2 degrees Celsius with 70 per cent humidity.
Although the weather remained mostly pleasant throughout the day, the humid conditions tested patience of the Karachiites as the ‘feel like’ temperature remained between 38 and 40 Celsius.
Despite frequent updates by the Met office, the city mostly relied on social media that mostly created a scare among residents.
The social media users were bombarded with ‘news’ of heavy showers coming to their way, which also kept the city administration on toes for the approaching challenge.
“In a number of Karachi schools, attendance was badly affected,” said the spokesman for the All Private Schools Management Association Sindh.
“Even late on Wednesday, we were contacted by several member schools who wanted to know about any announcement by the government of holiday as they were being approached or you can say forced by parents to announce a day off due to heavy rain forecast.”
As the city life largely remained unaffected with no significant rain, the city administration also claimed to have made all arrangement mainly for draining out rainwater from roads and low-lying areas.
“All major roads of Karachi’s were equipped with machinery on special directives of the Sindh CM, chief secretary and the mayor,” said the spokesman for the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation.
“The machinery, including suction machines and de-watering pumps, was put on high alert at Metropole Hotel, CM House, Governor House, Muslim Gymkhana, Merewether Tower, Bilawal Chowrangi, Jinnah Airport, Arts Council Chowrangi, PC Hotel, and 26th Street. Suction machines were also on high alert at Jinnah Hospital, Nursery, Gora Qabristan, Baloch Colony, FTC Flyover, University Road, Shahrah-i-Quaideen and MA Jinnah Road.”

6,Notices issued on JI candidates’ pleas  against election results,SHC extends its earlier restraining order against recount of votes in PS-112,"KARACHI: An election tribunal on Thursday issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and other respondents on two petitions filed by aspirants of Jamaat-i-Islami against the results of as many Sindh Assembly seats from the city.
Citing the ECP, chief election commissioner, rival/returned candidates and others as respondents, petitioners Mohammad Ahmed and Nusratullah submitted that they had contested the general elections from PS-124 (Karachi Central-III) and PS-126 (Karachi Central-V) respectively.
They impugned the victories of returned candidates of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Abdul Basit from PS-124 and Mohammad Ikhtiar Alam from PS-126.
The petitioners submitted that as per Form-45s, they had easily won the constituencies in question, but the results were fraudulently changed and the petitioners were shown runner-ups in the impugned From-47s.

SHC extends its earlier restraining order against recount of votes in PS-112

They asked the tribunal to set aside the impugned notifications regarding the returned candidates.
After preliminary hearings, the election tribunal, headed by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudary of Sindh High Court, issued notices to respondents as well as federal and provincial law officers for May 7.
Meanwhile, the SHC on Thursday extended its earlier restraining order against an order of the ECP about the recount of votes of candidates on a provincial assembly seat PS-112 (Keamari-II).
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-backed independent candidate Sirbuland Khan petitioned the SHC and submitted that he had secured 16,287 votes and won the election against the Pakistan Peoples Party aspirant Asif Khan, who got 10,784 votes.
The petitioner submitted that the ECP had on April 1 ordered recounting of votes of 26 polling stations in the constituency and challenged the same before the SHC.
The lawyer for petitioner argued that the petitioner had already taken oath as an MPA and despite this, the ECP had ordered the returning officer (RO) for a recount on an application of rival candidate Asif and further asked the RO to complete the recounting process within three days and prepare Form-49 accordingly.
He stated that under Section 95(6) of the Election Act, 2019 the ECP had no jurisdiction to recount the votes after consolidation of the results.
On Thursday, RO Nawaz Kalwar in his reply submitted that in the light of ECP’s order, the recounting process was completed on April 4 and Froms-48 and 49 had been prepared after the recount.
He also filed a copy of From-49, which said that after the recount, the PPP candidate stood winner with11,724 votes while petitioner was runner-up with 9,943 votes.
A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi adjourned the hearing till May 9 and said that its earlier restraining order would continue till the next hearing.
On April 5, the SHC had suspended the operation of the impugned order of ECP about recount till April 18.

“From the start of the raid, DSP-UT Umair Tariq and his private person switched off their mobile phone. That DSP-UT Umair Tariq lied that he was not involved in the raid,” this observation was detailed in an order by Judicial Magistrate (West) Muhammad Abdullah Qadri, who quashed the investigation officer’s request to dispose of the case by downgrading it in ‘C Class’ in the final chargesheet.
The court also noted that after the incident was highlighted on the media, over Rs10 million and other valuables were handed over to the complainant, Shakir Khan. However, over Rs9.6m and 20 to 30 tolas gold were yet to be recovered from the ‘un-arrested police officials and private person who had absconded for fear of arrest.’
In an almost identical order as the earlier judicial magistrate (west) issued, the judge took cognizance against all suspects including DSP Umair, SSP Imran Qureshi and 19 other policemen and private persons, and transferred the case to the sessions court for trial after completing necessary formalities.
Meanwhile, non-bailable warrants were also issued against the absconding suspects, with a directive to produce them at the next hearing scheduled for April 27. The judge also instructed DSP Syed Balaghat Hussain Shah, to submit a supplementary challan.

10,"Govt depts disposing of waste into fresh water at 769 points, CS tells SHC",HYDERABAD: Sindh Chief Secretary Syed Asif Hyder Shah has conceded before the Sindh High Court that the timelines ...,"HYDERABAD: Sindh Chief Secretary Syed Asif Hyder Shah has conceded before the Sindh High Court that the timelines for the implementation of Supreme Court-appointed water commission could not be met. He also conceded that were still 769 points from where different departments had been releasing waste into freshwater bodies.
The one-man commission headed by retired Justice Amir Hani Muslim had inspected most freshwater bodies and sewerage installations in Sindh in 2018 before recommending a series of measures to ensure provision of clean drinking water to citizens and improving sanitation across the province. The Sindh High Court has already held many proceedings since the Supreme Court directed it to see that the commission’s recommendation were implemented. 
The latest proceedings were held in continuation of the hearing of a petition filed by Aftab Ahmed, Noor Ahmed and Ali Akbar, residents of Johi, through Advocate Gulzar Almani in 2021. CS Asif Shah, along with Sindh Advocate General Mohammad Hassan Akbar personally appeared before the bench comprising Justice Shamsuddin Abbasi and Justice Amjad Ali Sahito.
While admitting that most recommendations of the water commission could not be implemented for various reasons, the chief secretary argued that they were “suggestive” and “guiding principles” in nature. 
He informed the bench that 31 proposals were short-term and the others medium- and long-term ones. Seventeen of them have been or are being implemented,” he added.
The judges heard him patiently, and observed that they trusted him for his track record, otherwise they were fed-up hearing departmental heads. “If we refer their [officers’] cases to anticorruption [establishment], it will give them clean chit while NAB won’t do anything either,” Justice Sahito remarked.
CS Asif admitted: “Indeed, substantive compliance is not seen on some proposals and timeline was missed for resource constraints, etc.” 
Giving a break-up of the works carried out under the commission’s directives, he said that out of 493 public health engineering (PHE) schemes, 273 were rehabilitated and 220 were pending rehab but the department had promised to complete them by June 2025. He said 46 schemes would be taken-up in Phase-III if found technically feasible.
He said PHE had been instructed to include ‘oxidation pond’ component in schemes from now onwards. In 77 works, oxidation ponds were built and land acquisition is pending in remaining ones. He added that 837 water supply schemes pertained to hypochlorinator and alum chambers processes in water supply works. He admitted that progress was not made on 600 schemes as yet.
Reading from his report, he stated that following the commission’s report, a survey was conducted and it was found that actually 769 points, and not 180, existed where untreated sewage was disposed of into irrigation channels. 
“[A total of] 428 such points are plugged and work on 341 points is underway as land acquisition [issue] is involved again,” he said, and added that the 769 points belonging to different departments were releasing waste into freshwater.
Incinerators at health facilities
Regarding the commission’s recommendations for health sector, the chief secretary said that the incinerators at these facilities were not working due to the design issue and absence of gas supply. 
“In 70pc cases, gas supply is not there. The health secretary has sought one month’s time to make them functional at 35-40 hospitals,” he said, adding that the department was trying to provide incinerators to major hospitals to implement a strategy. He said provision of 16 incinerators to district headquarters hospitals and 50 to taluka headquarters hospitals was envisaged under the annual development programme (ADP).
Referring to the commission’s observation that around 4,000 schools needed safe water supply, the CS revealed that actually they were around 5,000 in number. He said the project would take two years to resolve the issue. 
Manchhar Lake water
About Manchhar Lake water issue, the chief secretary noted that the commission had called for feeding the lake through two irrigation escape channels — Maado and Rawat — and said this project was under way.
At this juncture, Justice Sahito asked him to explain what action was taken against the chief engineer of the Right Bank of Sukkur Barrage for not emptying the lake in 2022, when floodwaters from Balochistan came and resultantly Khairpur Nathan Shah, Mahar and Johi were inundated. 
The CS invited the irrigation secretary, Zarif Khero, to assist court. Khero tried to explain that release of Manchhar’s flows always depended on flows in Indus. He said Manchhar was indeed emptied but in a controlled manner considering Indus flows.
Justice Sahito said Rs300m were collected during the floods but its utilisation eluded people. Khero succinctly said that works were indeed carried out and even lake’s bunds were breached to offload it, and added that soil salinity also added to the contamination of the lake’s water. 
“Manchhar Lake was not washed despite available flows rather it was an ‘eyewash’ for Sindh,” Justice Sahito said as Justice Abbasi came up with observation that “there is massive corruption in irrigation department”. Justice Abbasi said “if matter of corruption is referred to NAB it would not deliver”.
Petitioners’ counsel Gulzar Almani termed the chief secretary’s report “totally baseless”, and urged court to get the works inspected through sessions and civil court judges. “Everything will become crystal clear,” he told the bench. 
The court took the chief secretary’s report on record before adjourning the matter to a date to be fixed after three months.

11,Makli Civil Hospital upgraded to tertiary care facility,THATTA: Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Ikram Din Ujjan has said...,"THATTA: Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Ikram Din Ujjan has said that the institution has achieved a significant milestone in healthcare provision to the population of coastal districts of Thatta and Sujawal by upgrading the Makli Civil Hospital. 
Speaking at a ceremony to inaugurate trauma and surgical departments here on Wednesday, Prof Ujjan also announced upgrading and expansion of the hospital by increasing its capacity from 212 beds to 520 beds with provision of all essential machinery, equipment, staff, services and other facilities.
He highlighted significance of the upgradation and said that the hospital would now be able to cater to the healthcare needs of around 1.922 million population of the two districts as well as hundreds of other people coming from other districts. 
The upgradation has transformed the Makli Civil Hospital into a tertiary care institution, he said.
The ceremony was attended by prominent civil society activists of the field, besides LUMHS faculty, specialists, doctors, other senior medical professionals and paramedics.
Prof Ujjan also acknowledged the pivotal role already being played by the Makli Civil Hospital in providing standard healthcare services to the local people.
In order to address the pressing issues being faced by the people of this coastal region, and to meet the challenges confronting the hospital, LUMHS focused its effort on delivery of even better healthcare services and managed to expand the hospital’s in-house services to more than double the existing capacity, the VC said. 
The trauma and surgical departments mark a significant step forward in bolstering the health facility’s infrastructure, he added.
Prof Dr Sughra Parveen Uqaili (head of the surgical department who is in the frontline of ensuring success of the LUMHS plan), Prof Dr Mashooq Ali Khawaja, Dr Gul Mohammad Qazi and Dr Iqbal Memon are among the distinguished surgeons who, along with a team of highly experienced medical professionals from LUMHS have already started rendering their services at the Makli Civil Hospital.
“With the introduction of specialised services, the need for referrals to distant healthcare facilities stands mitigated,” Prof Ujjan said, and announced that LUMHS planned to initiate an MBBS programme on its Thatta campus, alongside the establishment of three medical colleges in the two districts.
Prof Dr Sughra Uqaili acknowledged full support from Sindh government and Medical Emergency Resilience Foundation (MERF) and its regional manager Adam Malik in executing the plan and maintaining the status of operating theatres at the Makli Civil Hospital. She also commended the efforts put in by all affiliated faculty members and other professions especially Prof Dr Mashooq Ali Khawaja, General Surgeon Dr Gul Mohammad Qazi and Dr Iqbal Memon.
