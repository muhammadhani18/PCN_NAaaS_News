1,How will JI’s ‘unconventional choice’ fare on the national stage?,"On Thursday, Rehman, 52, took oath as the sixth emir of the JI at a jam-packed ceremo­ny at the party’s Mansoora headquarters."," 

Hafiz Naeemur Rehman

KARACHI: It was early 2021, and a sizable crowd had gathered at one of the city’s busiest commercial centres for the opening of a pharmacy set up by Jamaat-i-Islami’s welfare arm — Al-Khidmat. They were eagerly waiting for the party leader who would grace the inauguration.
A car soon stopped near the gathered crowd, and JI’s Karachi chapter emir, Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, stepped out. Catching their first glim­pse, the crowd encircled him; some were enthusiastically shaking his hands and others took out their phones to click selfies with the JI leader.
The fervent salutations took so long that the organisers had to announce that the ceremony had been delayed a little “due to unavoidable reasons”.
Among the crowd were also many journalists, one of whom noted that Mr Rehman is “creating [an] impact” and said it wouldn’t surprise him if JI managed to dent other parties’ vote bank in upcoming elections in Karachi.
The prediction did hold some truth; in the three elections that followed, Mr Rehman’s popularity helped the party stage a strong comeback in the city, where it had been effectively wiped out in the 2018 elections.
In the Feb 8 general election, the party’s vote bank increased by 177 per cent, from 280,000 in 2018 to 775,000 in 2023, according to ECP data. Many attribute this jump in popularity to Mr Rehman’s active leadership.
Oath-taking
On Thursday, Mr Rehman, 52, took oath as the sixth emir of the JI at a jam-packed ceremo­ny at the party’s Mansoora headquarters.
After taking the oath, Mr Rehman laid out his agenda in an elaborate address, touching on all issues confronting Pakistan i.e. a democratic deficit, sinking economy, recent elections, questions over the role of the judiciary and army, etc.
“The JI does not recognise those imposed on us through Form-47s and the party must prepare for a movement to correct this electoral mistake. We also do not acknowledge all those parties running as dynastic and family concerns or drawing legitimacy from a ‘will’. All those seeded in establishment’s nursery also fall in the same category,” he said.
But for a party known for its more measured orators, Mr Rehman adopted a more populist approach, winning over the crowd with his rhetoric. By the end, he was so overcome with emotion that he seemed to be blinking back tears.
Vocal populist
A graduate of Karachi’s NED University of Engine­ering and Technology, Mr Rehman led the party in Karachi for a decade.
Observers see him as both an unconventional choice to lead the right-wing party, as well as a leader who would help JI “reconnect with the ground realities and requirements of electoral politics.”
Mr Rehman is known for his populist approach and vocal leadership.
“There was a huge vacuum in Karachi’s politics with no party — even those with a mandate from the city — becoming a voice of the locals,” said Kashif Hafeez of Pulse Consultants, a nationwide social research organisation with studies on several issues of Karachi.
He added that  the vacuum presented Mr Naeem with a chance and he became “the only voice” raising the issues faced by Karachi’s residents.
A daunting task
Since Mr Rehman’s appoi­ntment as the JI central emir earlier this month, there has been only one question on people’s minds. Can he replicate his success in Karachi at the national level?
When Dawn posed the same question to the JI leader after his appointment as the emir, he gave a brief answer where he emphasised giving hope to the masses.
“The youth of Pakistan is so disappointed; we haven’t witnessed such pessimism before. We are here only to give them hope.”
When asked about the solution to multiple crises faced by the country, he said, “I think that everyone, whether institution or individual, would have to go back to their constitutional domain. That’s it.”
For observers who have closely watched JI’s politics over the years, the new role would be an uphill challenge for Mr Rehman.
“It would be a great challenge [for Mr Rehman],” said senior journalist Mazhar Abbas, adding that he has only seen the politics of Karachi. “It’s yet to be seen how he makes moves in KP or Balochistan or Punjab.”

2,UAE flights will resume once weather clears,"CAA chief holds e-kutchery, confirms ASF taking action against employee who manhandled child","RAWALPINDI: Pakistani airlines, including PIA, are awaiting the restoration of facilities at Du­bai airport, and PIA will promptly resume its air operations once the situation improves, the flag carrier’s spokesperson said on Thursday.
The torrential rains in the Uni­ted Arab Emirates over the past three days have flooded runways, severely affecting flight operations at Dubai International Airport.
The PIA spokesperson said that stormy weather in Dubai and Sharjah had impacted air operations significantly, leading to the cancellation of 22 flights from Pakistan to Dubai since April 16.
Passengers on cancelled flights are being accommodated on the next available flights on a priority basis, he said, adding that more flights were being planned to repatriate passengers stuck in Dubai, the spokesperson said.
<CAA chief holds e-kutchery, confirms ASF taking action against employee who manhandled child
He said that passengers whose flights had been cancelled should contact the PIA call centre for flight information.
Meanwhile, during his address at an e-kutchery, Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) Dire­ctor General Khaqan Murtaza de­­s­­cribed the situation caused by rain in the UAE as “unprecedented”.
In response to a query about recent flight delays to and from the Middle East, he attributed the disruptions to record rains in the UAE, which resulted in flooding at airports and chaos in flight operations.
E-kutchery
Mr Murtaza chaired the 44th e-kutchery on Thursday, during which he and his team received 67 comments or queries covering topics including corroded trolleys, expansion of Allama Iqbal International (AIIAP) Airport,  alleged extortion and bribery at airports, HR-related issues, and UAE  weather-induced flight cancellations among others.
The issue of long immigration lines at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport (JIAP) has been raised with the prime minister and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), he explained, noting that CAA had allocated 20 counters to FIA and failure to adequately staff these counters was leading to lengthy queues.
He also mentioned that, according to the FIA, once it addresses its staffing problems, the queues will significantly decrease.
The DG confirmed that the Airport Security Force (ASF) had taken action against an employee involved in the manhandling of a child at JIAP, and the PCAA is following up the matter with the ASF.
Regarding Lahore’s AIIAP, the DG informed that measures have been taken to meet the growing number of passengers, but the fact is the airport has reached its design capacity.
He also instructed the airport manager of Islamabad Interna­tional Airport (IIAP) to investigate a complaint about money extortion in the parking lot, allegedly by police or police traffic wardens.
In response to another complaint, the DG emphasised that food prices at Islamabad airport must align with the price list.

3,CJP Isa calls for SC to work with full capacity,Says video link technology has made registries redundant.,"LAHORE: Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa on Thursday expressed his wish for the Supreme Cou­rt to perform with its full constitutional capacity.
“Filling the vacant positions of the judges in the Supreme Court and high courts is a priority,” he said at a select gathering of the Supreme Court lawyers at the Lahore Registry.
Senior puisne judge Ju­­stice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Athar Min­allah and Justice Shahid Waheed were also present at the gathering hosted by Supreme Court Bar Asso­ciation President Shahzad Shaukat.
The CJP said that rules for the Judicial Commis­sion of Pakistan were necessary before making the new appointments. He said a rule-making committee led by Justice Shah had submitted draft rules, adding that the draft is awaiting final approval. He requested the chief justices of respective high courts to gradually fill the vacancies of judges after the finalisation of rules.

Says video link technology has made registries redundant

He said the Supreme Court wanted a consensus among all the stakeholders, including the bar, on the procedure for the appointment of judges.
About the formation of SC benches at the registries, CJP Isa mentioned that the video link technology had made the registries redundant.
He said it remains to be seen whether to run the registries through a video link or by constituting benches for the registries. He stated that benches should not operate for less than a week at a registry and expressed his wish to work at all the registries.
He emphasised that the bar and the bench were not different, but a same institution.
The chief justice pointed out that he had referred the disputes of lawyers to the respective bars as he gave respect to the elected representatives of the bar.

4,PTI nominates Shibli Faraz as Senate opposition leader,Imran insists Saudi Arabia had no role in ‘regime change conspiracy’.," 

Shibli Faraz

ISLAMABAD: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday nominated Shibli Faraz as the new opposition leader in the Senate, and Mr Faraz is set to take the role with the endorsement of 21 senators.
The announcement came after a meeting of Mr Faraz and other leaders with Mr Khan in Adiala Jail. “Today I met Imran Khan in Adiala Jail, where he confirmed my nomination,” Mr Faraz told Dawn, adding that the Senate chairman was expected to formally recognise his position once the senators’ signatures were verified.
Sahibzada Hamid Raza, chairman of PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council, who also met Mr Khan, said the former prime minister categorically denied that Saudi Arabia had any role in the “regime change conspiracy”, a reference to Mr Khan’s April 2022 ouster.
The clarification came days after PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat accused both the United States and Saudi Arabia of conspiring to topple the PTI government, stirring tensions amid a critical visit from a high-level Saudi delegation to Pakistan.

Imran insists Saudi Arabia had no role in ‘regime change conspiracy’

A day later, the party publicly distanced itself from Mr Marwat’s comments and its leaders emphasised their respect for Saudi Arabia.
Another PTI leader, Muzzam­mil Aslam, quoted Imran Khan as saying that Saudi Arabia gave $2 billion just four months before the toppling of the PTI government. “Imran Khan also said that the foreign minister’s conference (held during PTI’s tenure) couldn’t have been organised without the role of Saudi Arabia,” he said.
Meanwhile, PTI’s Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan said that a more aggressive media policy would be pursued and initial steps would be taken within a week.
“It’s the final phase of our campaign, and soon, all institutions will start giving positive signals. Soon, Imran Khan will become the prime minister of Pakistan,” he said.
The PTI has also initiated a nationwide organisational effort to strengthen the party at grassroots level. In this regard, senior PTI lea­der Advocate Shoaib Shaheen has been assigned the responsibility of forming ‘block code-level organisations’ across Pakistan.
PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub Khan has notified Mr Shaheen to oversee the formation and function of the organisational structure of the party.
The party has also raised concerns over the health of Mr Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, alleging that her health has significantly worsened due to the substandard conditions and food provided during her imprisonment. The PTI clai­­ms her rights to necessary medical care are being obstructed.

5,Nooriabad case will yield no result: Murad,Court urged to wait for SC verdict in NAB law case.,"ISLAMABAD: Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has questioned the efficacy of the National Accountability Bureau, adding that his trial in the Nooriabad reference is of no consequence.
Mr Shah made the remarks after his appearance before an accountability court in connection with the Nooriabad reference on Thursday. 
The Sindh CM is accused of misusing his authority as provincial adviser and awarding contracts without feasibility studies of the projects, thus causing a loss of Rs8 billion to the exchequer.
The reference is an offshoot of the fake accounts case where he was accused of using his influence and releasing funds for the Nooriabad Power Plant (NPP) in violation of rules.

Court urged to wait for SC verdict in NAB law case

The NPP project was launched in 2014 under the public-private partnership at a cost of Rs13bn in which the Sindh government holds 49 per cent shares.
The remaining 51pc shares were owned by a private company.
It is also alleged that Mr Shah concealed material facts from the Sindh cabinet and allegedly misled it to benefit the Omni Group of companies, owned by Anwar Majeed, a close aide to President Asif Zardari. He also allegedly managed to release a Rs3bn loan to the companies concerned.
According to the reference, the NPP project was conceived to allegedly whiten the Omni Group’s ‘black money’.
Mr Shah’s counsel Arshad Tabrez informed the court that the matter related to the National Accountability Ordina­nce, which is pending adjudication before the Supreme Court.
He suggested the accountability judge, Nasir Javed Rana, to wait till the final decision of the apex court. Subseq­uently, the hearing was adjourned till June 26.
Talking to media persons after the hearing, CM Sindh said the court had conducted over 50 hearings in this reference, but to no avail.
According to him, NAB has filed a”‘flawed” reference and suggested that a comparison should made on the cost-effectiveness of entire proceedings.
Meanwhile, judicial magis­trate Suhaib Bilal Ranjha summoned witnesses in a case about liquor and display of weapons against Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.
CM Gandapur sought exemption from personal appearance.
The court accepted the application seeking exemp­­tion, and adjourned further proceeding till Friday (today).
