0,Regret US decision to veto draft resolution on Palestine’s UN membership: FO,"Granting UN membership to Palestine will mark a moment of historic justice, says FO","Pakistan on Friday expressed its disappointment on the United Nations Security Council’s inability to reach a consensus on Palestine’s full membership of the United Nations, also regretting the US decision to veto the draft resolution.
“Pakistan is deeply disappointed by the result of last night’s debate at UNSC and its inability to reach a consensus and recommend Palestine’s membership to UNGA. We regret the US decision to veto the draft resolution granting full membership of the UN to Palestine,” Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said in her weekly press briefing.
A day earlier, the US had effectively stopped the UN from recognizing a Palestinian state by casting a veto in the Security Council to deny Palestinians full membership in the world body.
 ""Granting UN membership to Palestine, a nation enduring 75 years of oppression, constitutes a validation of their inherent right to self-determination and will mark a moment of historic justice,"" maintained the FO spokesperson.

The FO emphasized, ""The Palestinian populace deserves the right to live in an autonomous state within the delineated confines of June 4, 1967, with its capital situated in Al-Quds.""
Referring to the recent visit by a delegation led by Minister of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia Prince Faisal bin Farhan, Mumtaz said that the counterparts from both nations delved into multiple regional and global concerns during the visit.
The office noted that the two ministers discussed the rising instability in the region, urging for an immediate halt to the hostilities in Gaza and ensuring unhindered humanitarian aid access.
The Palestinian push for full UN membership came six months into a war between Israel and the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and as Israel is expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank, which the UN considers to be illegal.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the US veto in a statement as ""unfair, unethical, and unjustified.""

1,Lawyers aim to wrap up jury selection in Trump criminal trial,Trump maintains his plea of not guilty amidst a contentious jury selection process,"Lawyers in Donald Trump's criminal trial are expected on Friday to wrap up the painstaking process of selecting a jury that will for the first time in US history determine whether a former president is guilty of breaking the law.
With the 12-member jury already chosen, prosecutors and defense lawyers need to select six alternates for the trial, which is expected to run through May.
Opening statements could start on Monday.
Two jurors have already been removed from the case. On Thursday, Justice Juan Merchan dismissed one juror who said she felt intimidated after friends and relatives figured out she had been chosen for the trial. Another was dismissed after prosecutors questioned whether he had been truthful about prior run-ins with the law.
Jury selection is often a contentious process, as lawyers on either side jockey to assemble a panel they hope will be most sympathetic to their interests.
But it has proven especially challenging in this case, which involves a controversial former president who is accused of covering up a hush-money payment to a porn star shortly before he was elected in 2016.
Trump has pleaded not guilty.
It is one of four criminal cases Trump faces but the only one certain to go to trial ahead of the Nov 5 election, when the Republican politician aims to again take on Democratic President Joe Biden. A conviction would not bar him from office.
Roughly half of the more than 200 potential jurors who were screened said they would not be able to impartially assess Trump's guilt or innocence. All were drawn from Manhattan, a heavily Democratic city that was once Trump's hometown.
Trump has said all four criminal cases are an effort by Biden allies to undercut his campaign. His criticism of witnesses, prosecutors, the judge, and their relatives in this case and others has also sparked concerns about harassment, prompting Merchan to impose a partial gag order.
Trump has tested the limits of that gag order, posting on Wednesday that undercover liberal activists had been lying to get on the jury. Prosecutors have asked Merchan to penalize him.
Merchan has taken steps to shield jurors from harassment, saying they will remain anonymous except to Trump, his lawyers, and prosecutors. On Thursday, he said he would prohibit news outlets from reporting on aspects of potential jurors' employment.
In this case, Trump is accused of covering up a $130,000 payment his former lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says they had a decade earlier.
Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and denies any such encounter with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.
Trump has pleaded not guilty in his other three criminal cases as well. Two accuse him of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden, while another accuses him of mishandling classified information after he left office.

2,Russia's Shoigu says tank production is booming,Shoigu stresses to enhance the production of tank protection equipment amidst the escalating conflict in Ukraine.,"Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Friday that the country was ramping up manufacturing of tanks and heavy flamethrower systems, but more work was needed to increase production of tank protection equipment.
Shoigu's ministry published a video showing him touring a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk and meeting workers, whom he praised for exceeding production targets.
""The Omsk plant is fulfilling the program - I can say it is even over-fulfilling the program,"" Shoigu was shown telling officials. ""The issues and tasks that we decided on during our last visit have almost all been resolved.""
Building new tanks is a necessity for Russia because of heavy equipment losses in the first two years of the war in Ukraine. The International Institute for Strategic Studies said in February that Russia had lost more than 3000 tanks there, the equivalent of its entire active inventory before the war, and was having to pull old ones out of storage to replace them.
Shoigu ordered factory heads to increase production of tank protection equipment and said beefing up supplies to tank repair brigades was a key area of focus.
""Now we need to significantly increase the additional kits that we need to put on those vehicles that are in combat,"" he said.
Shoigu's visit comes as Russian forces are pummelling the strategically important Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar with artillery, drones, and air strikes. Kyiv says  Moscow wants to take the town by May 9, the date when Russia commemorates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two.
Omsk personnel told Shoigu that the factory had increased production of ""Solntsepek"" heavy flamethrower systems by 2.5 times and that the next shipment of a new model of the T-80BVM main battle tank was ready to be sent to the front.
Factory heads told the defense minister they had hired an additional 1,200 staff since last year and were working around the clock in two shifts to expand production capacity.
Shoigu also spotlighted the production of anti-drone systems. Kyiv has mounted frequent drone strikes on Russian energy infrastructure since the start of the year hitting some major oil refineries across the world's second-largest oil exporter and sending up oil prices.

3,"India votes in gigantic election dominated by jobs, Hindu pride and Modi","First and largest of phase of seven, covering 166 million voters in 102 constituencies across 21 states","Indians began voting on Friday in the world's largest election as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks a historic third term on the back of issues such as growth, welfare, Hindu nationalism and personal popularity.
The vote pits Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against an alliance of two dozen opposition parties that promise greater affirmative action and more handouts while stressing what they call the need to save democratic institutions.
""Modi will come back to power, because apart from the religious push, his other work, in areas such as safety and security, is good,"" said Abdul Sattar, 32, a Muslim voter in the city of Kairana in the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh.
He was among those queuing outside polling stations, some well before the opening time of 7am , amid tight security.
Friday's phase is the first and largest of seven, covering 166 million voters in 102 constituencies across 21 states and territories, from Tamil Nadu in the south to Arunachal Pradesh on the Himalayan frontier with China.
Almost a billion people in the world's most populous nation are eligible to vote in the entire exercise running through the peak of summer until June 1, with results set for June 4.
Surveys suggest the BJP will easily win a majority even though voters worry about unemployment, inflation and rural distress in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
Unemployment was the main concern for Mohammed Shabbir, another Muslim voter in Kairana, about 100 km (60 miles) from Delhi, the capital.
The 60-year-old driver and father of eight said none of his children had regular jobs.
""Even the Hindus are affected by a lack of jobs,"" he said, explaining that he saw it outweighing Hindu nationalism as an election issue in the Hindu-majority nation.
Hindu nationalism is a key election theme, especially after Modi's January consecration of a grand temple to the God-king Lord Ram on a site in the northern city of Ayodhya believed to be his birthplace.
Critics accuse Modi's government and party of targeting India's 200 million minority Muslims to please their hardline Hindu base - charges both deny.
Modi aims to win 370 of parliament's 543 seats, up from 303 in 2019, hoping for a two-thirds majority that some fear could let his party make far-reaching constitutional changes.
Strong southern push
Voters in Tamil Nadu, one of India's most developed states where the BJP is weak, seemed divided on whether Modi's strong push this time would benefit his party.
""Modi has made India a peaceful country, particularly for Hindus,"" said S. Rajagopal, a three-wheel taxi driver in the state capital of Chennai.
""The BJP may not boost its vote share in Tamil Nadu but nationwide, Modi will win hands down again.""
V. Parasuraman, 55, who works in the construction business, said the BJP had done little for Tamil Nadu, however.
""Their leaders didn't even come here when Chennai was flooding. People here are educated and ... won't fall for Modi's sugar-coated words.""
The BJP campaign takes as its theme Modi’s guarantee to fulfil promises to voters.
""I particularly call upon the young and first-time voters to vote in large numbers,"" Modi posted on X minutes before polls opened. ""After all, every vote counts and every voice matters.""
A Modi victory would make him only the second Indian prime minister to be elected three times in a row, after post-independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru.
Prospects of heat, violence
With India forecast to experience more heat-wave days than normal this year, a more immediate concern is how the weather could affect voter turnout.
The threat of violence looms in some pockets, such as the central state of Chhattisgarh, after security forces killed 29 Maoist rebels. On Friday, the forces used drones to track rebel movements while patrolling polling areas.
Parts of the eastern state of West Bengal saw sporadic violence before the vote, as workers of the BJP and regional rival Trinamool Congress accused each other of attacks.
Some BJP insiders and analysts say the party is worried about fatigue, complacency or overconfidence among voters and party members, however, and needs to draw people to vote.
Yet the opposition's INDIA alliance has struggled to forge unity. It has accused the government of hobbling its efforts by arresting its leaders in graft cases and making huge tax demands ahead of the vote - charges the government denies.
The election will decide the future of Indian democracy, Rahul Gandhi, leader of the main opposition Congress party, said in a post on X.
""Strengthen democracy by applying the balm of your vote to the wounds inflicted on the soul of the nation in the last 10 years ... defeat hatred,"" he said on Friday.

4,PTI’s Shibli nominated as Senate opp leader,Party senators officially submit request to upper house secretariat,"The PTI has nominated Senator Shibli Faraz as their candidate for the position of Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House. In compliance with the directive from PTI founder Imran Khan, the party's senators have formally submitted a request to the Senate Secretariat endorsing Shibli for the position. This nomination is endorsed by all 19 PTI senators.
Following a meeting with Imran Khan in Adiala Jail, Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) Chairman Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza informed the media that Senator Shibli Faraz has been appointed as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate according to Imran Khan's instructions.
During the meeting with Imran, it was decided that the newly formed six-party alliance of opposition parties—Tehreek Tahaffuz-e-Ain—that started its protest movement from Balochistan last week will also hold rallies in the rest of the country.
The SIC, which is part of the alliance, will convene a meeting of all six opposition parties in Lahore on April 29 to discuss the movement's strategy, with plans for a nationwide launch.
Contrary to earlier reports, Imran Khan has denied statements regarding Saudi Arabia's involvement in any regime change operation in Pakistan.
He highlighted the support received from Saudi Arabia during his government, citing examples such as hosting the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference and financial assistance.
PTI Central Information Secretary Raoof Hassan underscored that the movement for constitutional supremacy and the rule of law has reached its final stages, expressing confidence in their victory. He indicated forthcoming positive developments and reiterated Imran Khan's anticipated release from jail.
Imran Khan's directive to pursue an assertive media policy was emphasized, with plans to address previously unexplored topics. PTI leader Muzzammil Aslam clarified Imran Khan's denial of statements attributed to him regarding the Saudi government.
Discussions also covered Pakistan's economic situation, with updates on IMF negotiations for a new programme and international donors pledging $1.8 billion at a recent conference in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P). Imran stressed the importance of the rule of law for fostering trust and investment.

5,"FIA needs to ‘man up’ at Karachi airport, PM told",CAA DG says agency needs to overcome personnel shortage at immigration counters,"Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Director General Flt Lt (retd) Khaqan Murtaza on Thursday said he had informed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that if the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) overcame its shortage of manpower at the Karachi airport, the problem of long immigration queues there would not arise.
“Over 20 [immigration] counters have been provided to the FIA at the Karachi airport,” the CAA DG told the participants of the authority’s 44th open Karachi organized in the port city.
According to a CAA statement, the CAA DG pointed out that our region was known for drug trafficking.
“Unfortunately, drugs are seized at some airport in the country every day,” he continued. “Most of those convicted in the Middle East [for drug trafficking] belong to Pakistan, tarnishing the country’s image.”
The CAA DG stressed the need for strict checking of baggage at the country’s airports for the sake of national dignity.
The official replied to queries in connection with the outsourcing of the country’s three major airports – those in Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi. He said after the outsourcing, clear positive changes would be observed in airport service delivery.
Murtaza informed the participants that the manager of the Islamabad airport had been directed to investigate the incident of alleged extortion of money by police wardens in the parking lot.
“In the recent past, such elements were removed from near the airport exit and the beggars were handed over to the police from the parking lot,” he explained.
The CAA DG said its manager had been instructed to monitor the prices of food items being sold at the airport.
Murtaza clarified that because of the outsourcing of the Islamabad International Airport, long-term commercial concession agreements could not be entered there. The CAA DG informed the participants of the gathering that the expansion work of the Lahore airport building would be resumed soon.
He continued that if the expansion work was unsatisfactory, the company carrying it out would be changed. The CAA DG observed that there were cultural reasons for the unnecessary crowdedness at the country’s airports.
He told the airport managers to prepare recommendations to address this problem.
Murtaza recalled that the ‘one guest with a passenger’ policy had been successfully implemented in the past.
The CAA DG further said the Airport Security Force (ASF) had charge-sheeted its officer, who had misbehaved with a minor girl at the Karachi airport last month. He added that the CAA was in touch with the ASF over this incident.
Murtaza noted that airlines only chose profitable routes and that was why two private airlines were not flying to Quetta as there were not enough passengers.
However, he continued that Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and two private airlines were operating in the provincial capital of Balochistan.
The CAA DG informed the gathering that flights were delayed to the Middle East because of the “abnormal” weather there.
In a related development, a PIA spokesperson said in a statement that the airline’s flights to the UAE were affected by the recent torrential rains in Sharjah and Dubai.
The spokesperson added that the PIA’s normal flight operations in the UAE would resume when the weather situation improved there.
The passengers of the canceled flights are being accommodated on the next ones on a priority basis.
The spokesperson continued that other than that, more flights were also being planned to the UAE.
He requested the passengers of the canceled flights to contact the PIA call center at 786786111 for further information.

6,SC stays re-polling in PB-51 constituency,ECP had notified the election victory of Independent candidate Abdul Khaliq Khan,"The Supreme Court on Thursday suspended repolling at 12 polling stations in the Balochistan Assembly Constituency PB-51 Chaman with the consent of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), and issued notices to the relevant parties to the case, including the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP).
A three-member bench, led by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, and including Justice Ayesha Malik and Justice Irfan Saadat Khan heard the appeal of Asghar Khan Achakzai, a candidate of the Awami National Party (ANP) who remained runner-up in the February 8 general elections.
In this constituency, the ECP had notified the election victory of Independent candidate Abdul Khaliq Khan, who had secured 20,390 votes. Achakzai on the other hand got 19,623 votes. However, the ECP ordered re-polling on 12 polling stations because of an unnatural turnout.
In his appeal, Achakzai had requested for re-polling at 11 more polling stations, where he claimed that the turnout was unnatural. During the hearing, the lawyer for the appellant requested the apex court to stop the re-polling on 12 polling stations.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar said that the court could not decide the matter immediately and stressed that the ECP’s point of view would have to be heard on the matter. An ECP official said that the polls supervisor had no objection on withholding the re-polling until the proceedings were completed.
The ECP Law Department director general told the court that if necessary, the re-polling could be postponed for 7-or 10 days. The court stayed the re-polling, which was scheduled for April 21 and issued notices to the relevant parties.
