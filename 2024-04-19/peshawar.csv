0,"PHC orders clampdown on profiteers, hoarders",Warns violators of its orders will face action,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday disposed of a petition against hikes in the prices of essential commodities and their hoarding in the province and directed the provincial government to take strict action against profiteers and hoarders.
A bench consisting of Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Sahibzada Asadullah pronounced that it would issue directives to the government and administrative officers on the matter in the detailed judgement of the case, and action would be taken against the violators of those directives.
It observed that there was a need for dealing with those involved in price hikes and hoarding with an iron hand and handing down exemplary punishments to them.
The petition was filed by Peshawar resident Malik Ahmad Javed, who requested the court to direct the federal and KP governments as well as deputy commissioners in the province to immediately act against profiteers and hoarders, who, he insisted, were violating the law by not following the price lists issued by the government for essential commodities.

Warns violators of its orders will face action

Advocate general Shah Faisal Uthmankhel represented the provincial government, while lawyer Abbas Khan Sangeen appeared for the petitioner.
Special secretary to the home department Zubair Ahmad, food director Yasir Hussain, officials of the KP Food Safety and Halal Food Authority, and others appeared in the case.
During the hearing, Justice Shakeel observed that if the provincial government was serious about tackling the issue, it had to increase the powers of the administrative officers.
It added that price hikes and lawlessness had increased since the powers of the deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners were reduced.
The judge observed that those adulterating consumer goods were not only violating Islamic teachings but the laws of the land as well.
The bench observed that the DC no longer had the power to order the police to provide security personnel during raids for checking the prices of essential commodities.
AG Shah Faisal Uthmankhel said the government, in accordance with the order of the court, had submitted two progress reports on the matter.
He claimed that 9,237 market inspections had so far been conducted, whereas fines to the tune of Rs12.3 million were imposed on and recovered from profiteers.
The bench observed that mere fines won’t make law violators mend their ways, as they knew they would be back to work after paying the nominal fine.
It added that in the past, a single magistrate had been controlling the prices of commodities in the provincial capital as he had enough powers to take action against law violators.
The AG said the government had also been contemplating increasing the powers of the administrative officers.
He said if the high court issued orders for legislation on the matter, then the government would look into it.
The bench wondered why the government had been leaving every issue to the court for resolution instead of taking corrective steps by itself.
Special secretary Zubair said the price review committees had regularly been conducting their meetings.
He said last month, the home department issued detailed instructions to secretaries of all relevant departments, deputy commissioners and other relevant officers for the enforcement of official rates of essential goods.
Mr Zubair said the administrative officers had been instructed to drastically increase the overall volume of inspections of shops and sale points, take strict action against all those involved in illegal practices, and propose changes in various legal instruments that were being implemented by them in this regard.
Justice Asadullah observed that the bench would look into the reports submitted by the government and if they’re not found satisfactory, the court could review the situation yet again.
Advocate Abbas Khan said the administrative officers should ensure that all shopkeepers, retailers, and service providers display the notified price lists for all essential items on their premises and service-providing units to avoid any inconvenience to the people.
He claimed that while price lists were issued by the administration, they had not been followed by the shopkeepers.
Lawyer Akhtar Hussain Awan appeared for the Fresh Milk Sellers Association and said the association had requested the government to sit down with it to ascertain prices of dairy products, including milk and yogurt, but the latter didn’t accept the request.
Justice Shakeel observed that the toxic chemical Formalin was mixed with milk.
An official of the FSHFA said the authority had been using modern instruments to test milk and destroyed adulterated milk on the spot.

2,Militants’ attempt to attack Lakki Marwat police station foiled,Personnel noticed movement of armed miscreants with the help of modern gadgets and opened fire on them.,"LAKKI MARWAT: The police foiled an attempt by militants to attack a police station in Bargai area here, claimed a police official on Thursday. The official said that a group of militants assembled in the remote rural area late Wednesday night to target the police station building.
He added that the personnel deployed at the police station noticed movement of the armed miscreants with the help of modern gadgets and opened fire on them. “Before the terrorists could strengthen their position, the policemen who were fully alert attacked them,” he maintained, adding that the quick response by police left the armed terrorists with no option but to flee the area.
The Bargai police station was established in 2021 to maintain law and order in the peripheries of the district and check infiltration of militants from adjacent tribal districts of erstwhile Fata.
In Dec 2022, four policemen were martyred and four others including an ASI were injured when terrorists attacked a police station in Bargai area.
Meanwhile, a kingpin of a bandits’ gang was injured in an encounter with police in Tajori Town here on Thursday.
A police official told Dawn that an intense fire exchange took place when police came face-to-face with the bandits near Kattukhel Adda. He said that a party of Tajori police station reached the area on receiving information about the presence of proclaimed offenders Naseer Khan, a ringleader of bandits’ gang, and Tahir Khan. “When policemen reached the area, the armed men opened fire on them in a bid to flee the place on a motorcycle,” he maintained.
The official said that police retaliated and the fire exchange continued for some time.
“After the gunfight, police launched a search in the area and arrested Naseer Khan in injured condition while his accomplice managed to disappear in the forest,” he claimed, saying that the police also seized an AK-47 assault rifle, ammunition and a stolen motorcycle from the arrested suspect.
He said the police shifted the injured PO to a hospital and registered a case against him and his accomplice under the relevant sections of law.

3,Rajgal and Pagdara elders seek return to their hometowns,KHYBER: Elders from bordering regions of Rajgal and Pagdara in Tirah valley have demanded of the authorities...,"KHYBER: Elders from bordering regions of Rajgal and Pagdara in Tirah valley have demanded of the authorities concerned to arrange for their return without any further delay as they had been living away from their home for the last 14 years.
A resolution to this effect was unanimously passed during a jirga of Rajgal and Pagdara elders in Jamrud on Thursday, while a delegation of Rajgal elders also met the Khyber deputy commissioner the other day and conveyed to him their demand for immediate return.
The tribal elders said that on a number of occasions in the recent past they were given assurances about the restoration of peace and their subsequent return both by the security officials and district administration but they were still awaiting a final go-ahead for their return.
They said their houses and agricultural lands were in immediate need of repair and rehabilitation as no maintenance was carried out of their personal properties during the last 14 years.
They demanded of the district administration to expedite the process of damage assessment survey so that the affected families could be duly compensated for their losses and thus enabling them to start rebuilding their damaged homes.
They also demanded initiation of development projects in the affected areas as the decade-long militancy and subsequent military operations had badly damaged the entire infrastructure in areas close to the Afghan border which were in dire need of rehabilitation.
The Rajgal and Pakdara elders also expressed their concern over the ruthless cutting of the natural forest by an organised timber mafia in their mountains and insisted that their prompt return could save the forest from further vandalism by the timber mafia.
The tribal elders also expressed their serious concern over the illegal excavation of mines in Thor Sapar, Pagdara, Speen Ghar, Jalal Din Mela, Spee Arrakh and Rajgal and smuggling of precious stones in large quantities to the gem markets in major cities of the country.

4,Hospital board takes major decisions despite ban,BoG chairman Mushtaq Jadoon denies any wrongdoing at the hospital,"PESHAWAR: Despite repeated directives by health department, barring Boards of Governors from taking major decisions at medical teaching institutions, Ayub Teaching Hospital Abbottabad has made appointments, promotions and re-designation of positions, according to documents.
BoG chairman of the hospital Mushtaq Jadoon, however, said that those decisions had been approved by previous board before imposition of ban by the department. “We just vetted the same. These are not major policy decisions at all. There is nothing illegal,” he added.
On March 8, health department imposed a ban on major decisions by BoGs of teaching hospitals including recruitments, appointments, terminations, promotions, procurements and awarding fresh tenders. However, Ayub Teaching Hospital (ATH), Abbottabad, has violated the directives, according to documents.
Documents show that major decisions were taken in the 96th meeting of BoG of ATH held on April 3 in violation of the ban imposed by the government. Three BoG members stayed away while the chairman attended the meeting online. The minutes published on April 8 revealed that major policy decisions were taken to benefit specific employees.

BoG chairman Mushtaq Jadoon denies any wrongdoing at the hospital

As per decisions, Dr Ather Lodhi, who is also hospital director (HD), was designated as coordination officer in BPS-21 despite deference of the same from agenda items thrice in previous BoG meetings. Dr Lodhi, previously serving as chief medical officer in BPS-20, was not only promoted to BPS-21 but also his position was re-designated as coordination officer in BPS-21, a designation that did not exist under the law.
An officer serving as a patient record manager (BS-17) was not only upgraded to BPS-18 but also re-designated as manager human resource, say documents.
The BoG upgraded the position of manager radiology to BPS-18, as the actual sanctioned position of officer was patient record manager in BPP-17 and no such position existed. It had been rejected thrice in the past.
An employee of health department in BPS-20 was granted a No Objection Certificate (NoC) for transfer to ATH despite non-availability of position. The BoG’s subcommittee deliberated that the performance of a security officer was not up to mark but he was promoted to BPS-18.
Despite a ban on recruitment and creation of new posts, the BOG approved hiring of 10 fixed-pay Class-IV employees that falls under major decision-making. It approved the promotion of two pharmacists to the posts of senior pharmacist in BPS-18 and from BPS-18 senior pharmacist to chief pharmacist in BPS-19. The latter had faced disciplinary proceedings and served more than half of his time as officer on special duty.
The board also granted go-ahead to creation and formal notification of management cadre doctors, which falls under major policy decisions.
Honorarium of Rs5,000 was granted to 852 Class-IV staffers causing financial burden to the hospital of Rs4,260,000. An allowance of Rs150,000 was approved for hospital director (HD). He was reappointed for three months or until the arrival of a permanent HD while salary of medical director was raised by Rs50,000 per month along with previous areas from September 2022.
Documents show that a telephone exchange supervisor was promoted from BPS-11 to BPS-14. HD procured medicines worth Rs400 million in violation of ban.
However, chairman of BoG Mr Jadoon denied any wrongdoing at the hospital.
Sources in health department said that BoGs of 10 medical teaching institutions were directed to refrain from taking major policy decisions till the appointments of new BoGs.
The caretaker government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had replaced the BoGs appointed by the previous PTI government. They are likely to be terminated soon. “Some BoGs of MTIs are taking major decisions, much to the embarrassment of the government, which wants to appoint its own boards,” sources said.

8,Experts call for strengthening primary healthcare to put brakes on diseases,PESHAWAR: Experts at a seminar called upon policymakers to focus on strengthening primary healthcare to put brakes ...,"PESHAWAR: Experts at a seminar called upon policymakers to focus on strengthening primary healthcare to put brakes on non-communicable diseases, which accounted for 74 per cent of the worldwide mortalities.
“Of 40 million annual deaths, 77 per cent occurs in middle income countries like Pakistan. Most of the deaths are preventable provided we control use of tobacco, inculcate the habit of exercise and take steps to control air pollution,” Dr Zafar Mirza, former federal health minister, told participants of the four-day international public health conference at Khyber Medical University here on Thursday.
He said that every third adult person of 18 years had hypertension while every fourth above 20 years suffered from type-2 diabetes that could be avoided. World Health Organisation says that 90pc of essential health services should be made available at primary healthcare facilities.
KMU’s Dr Khalid Rehman said that innovative approaches such as artificial intelligence could be effectively utilised to tackle the threats posed by climatic change and lessen burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). “Prevention is far better than treatment for which we need to make our primary health services more effective,” he said.
Prof Zainab Samad from Aga Khan University Karachi said that life expectancy could be increased in Pakistan from 68 to 80 years by adopting healthy habits as lack of physical inactivity was causing host of NCDs that were preventable. “Low health literacy is the main issue haunting people physically as well as economically,” she said.
The director of Institute of Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine, Dr Aakifullah Khan said that only 20 pc cancer cases were reported in Pakistan. He stressed the need for adopting evidence-based policy to cope with the number of cancer patients. He said that there were five hospitals run by Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but more facilities were required in view of the growing number of patients in the province.
KMU Vice-chancellor Prof Ziaul Haq said that people preferred to visit tertiary care hospitals despite the fact the most health problems could be addressed at basic health unit and rural health centre.
“We are ready to assist government in shaping the health system under which the quantum of diseases can be lessened a great deal,” he said.
Health Minister Syed Qasim Ali said that they were launching campaigns at educational institutions on May 1 to scale up awareness regarding causes of NCDs. “The prevalence of 30pc diabetes is alarming and we need to work as a team to overcome the situation. We want to work in collaboration with institutions,” he said.

A municipal worker fumigates a street in Naurang Town, Lakki Marwat, on Thursday. — Dawn

 
LAKKI MARWAT: The health department has intensified efforts to execute a plan to prevent the spread of dengue here.
An official of the department told Dawn on Thursday that a comprehensive plan had been formulated to control dengue and vector-borne diseases with the support and consultation of the district administration and other stakeholders.
“There is a high risk of dengue spread here after the recent spell of heavy rain and weather change,” he said.
The official said the health department was fully alert to the situation and had made necessary arrangements for the successful execution of the dengue control plan.
Jamil Khan, an entomologist at the district health office, said municipal administrations had been provided with insecticides for fumigating the respective areas.
“Municipal workers have conducted fumigation in urban and rural parts of Lakki Marwat, Ghaznikhel and Naurang tehsils to kill mosquito larvae,” he said.
The official said a large quantity of larvicides was sprayed in sewers.
He said as part of the awareness drive, employees of civic bodies distributed pamphlets and handbills highlighting dengue symptoms and ways and means to prevent and treat the mosquito-borne disease.

10,USAID set to embark on $20m Education Resilience Activity,Mission director says initiative to focus on underserved children,"PESHAWAR: Mission Director of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for Pakistan Kate Somvongsiri on Thursday said the premier international development agency would soon launch a $20 million Education Resilience Activity (ERA) in Pakistan, including the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
“It’s going to be a nationwide project with KP being one of the focused areas,” Ms Somvongsiri told reporters at the US Consulate here.
She said the ERA would focus on improving people’s access to education and the quality of education policies, while the resilience part includes climate change.
“We are not building schools and will rather offer technical assistance to people building schools to make them climate resilient,” she said.
The USAID mission director said that the schools built by the USAID were among some of the structures that stood intact during past floods.

Mission director says initiative to focus on underserved children

She added that the activity was for the education of girls and children with disabilities, the underserved groups in Pakistan.
“We are excited about the launch of this activity soon,” she said.
Ms Somvongsiri said there were many areas of alignment between the USAID and KP government like academic development, skill building, energy, power, and agriculture.
She said Wednesday’s donor conference was a good initiative on part of the new government in the province.
“Since 2009, USAID has provided over $1 billion in assistance to the province. It’s in grants, unlike loans provided by other organisations. It means that the USAID provides grants for the projects and does not expect repayments,” she said.
The USAID mission director said currently, 26 USAID projects were under way in the province in very diverse areas like academic development, women’s development, education, climate change, and energy.
She added that the agency had built a lot of infrastructure, especially in the power sector.
Ms Somvongsiri said USAID had supported the Gomal Zam Dam, Tarbla, and other energy projects.
“We have provided 253 megawatts of electricity, mostly hydel, clean, and affordable energy to the province,” she said.
The mission director said that at the national level, USAID had helped add 4000 megawatts of energy to the national grid, which was all clean and affordable energy.
She said the agency also helped with the execution of the Golen Gol project.
Regarding the road infrastructure, Ms Somvongsiri said that the agency had helped build over 1300 kilometres of roads, bridges, link roads, and tunnels in the province.
“These roads are a way to livelihood and connectivity to the outside world, where the economic potential lies,” she said.
She said education and health were priority areas of USAID.
“We helped build 29 new schools and rehabilitated over 1,000 others affected by the conflict and natural disasters in the province. We are also working with the government to introduce the private public partnership mode for the improvement of education in the province,” she said.
The mission director said USAID wasn’t just building infrastructure but also ensuring the provision of quality education to people as well.
She said in the higher education sector, the agency extended help to eight universities, including the modern centre for energy at the University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar.
“We have also built the faculty of education in four universities, including Gomal University, the University of Peshawar, Hazara University, and the University of Malakand,” she said, revealing the provision of over 1,000 merit- and need-based scholarships to students from across the province.

11,Mansehra nanbais go on strike against cut in roti price,Say govt move unreasonable amid high inflation,"MANSEHRA: Nanbais observed a shutter down strike here on Thursday complaining about the district administration’s move to reduce the roti prices.
They announced that they would open shops only after the rates were reversed.
“We [tandoor owners] won’t accept the new roti prices fixed by the district administration and have decided to go on strike for an indefinite period,” Mansehra Nanbais Association president Sardar Zaheer Hussain told reporters.
The shutter down strike was reported on Abbottabad Road, Kashmir Road, Shinkiari Road, Lari Adda, and other areas of Mansehra city and adjoining areas. However, tandoors provided roti to restaurants.

Say govt move unreasonable amid high inflation

Complying with the provincial government’s orders, deputy commissioner Bilal Shahid Rao set the rates for every roti weighing 100 grams and 200 grams at Rs15 and Rs30, respectively, the other day.
The nanbais association’s president said the roti rates fixed by the administration were unacceptable to tandoor owners for being unreasonable amid high inflation.
“Inflation has hit an all-time high, so you better decide how we can run our business in such circumstances,” he said.
Mr Hussain said nanbais would prefer shutting down businesses than accepting the unjustified roti rates set by the district administration.
The residents suffered due to the nanbais’ strike. They demanded of the government to enforce its decision to slash roti rates.
They said the rate of wheat flour had come down significantly in recent days and was likely to reduce further in the days ahead due to the projected bumper wheat crop.
“When flour price goes up slightly, nanbais take no time to increase roti price but when the government has ordered them to slash it they’ve refused to do so. It is unacceptable,” said resident Mohammad Ajmal.
He said the roti price of Rs25 was unacceptable following a recent cut in the flour price.
RELEASE OF FUNDS DEMANDED: The chairmen of village and neighbourhood councils in Balakot tehsil here on Thursday demanded of the government to immediately release funds for municipal and social services.
“Village, neighbourhood and tehsil councils provide basis for the democratic setup and offer basic services to residents. Two years have passed since the establishment of these bodies but we’re still without funds and other rights,” chairman of the Pattan Des village council in Kaghan Valley Raja Khalid Nawaz told reporters here.
Accompanied by the chairmen of village and neighbourhood council from Balakot tehsil, he said the successive governments in the province ignored local bodies and tried to do away with the LG system.
“We, local body representatives across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, are united to claim rights. We will thwart any government bid to wind up this system,” he said.
Mr Nawaz said the local body members from Balakot tehsil would join the street protests by their counterparts in the province.
“The government should immediately release development funds to village, neighbourhood and tehsil councils and empower them in accordance with the LG Act, 2013,” he said.
The village council’s chairman said the Election Commission of Pakistan should hold elections for the presiding officers of local bodies without them as the council meetings couldn’t take place for the last two consecutive years due to the absence of the custodians of those houses.

The couple was indicted by an accountability court in 2019 for allegedly possessing assets to the tune of Rs332 million, which the prosecution claimed were not in accordance with their known sources of income.
However, the reference was returned to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) along with several other references in 2022 after drastic changes were made in the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999.
The present reference along with others were returned to the accountability courts here after the Supreme Court had in September last year declared the amendments made in the NAB law unconstitutional.
An accountability court presided over by judge Rajab Ali resumed hearing in the reference.
Former minister Arbab Alamgir appeared in person, whereas Asma Alamgir was exempted from personal appearance on Thursday.
The court fixed May 7 for the next hearing and has summoned four of the prosecution witnesses.
The couple belonging to Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarian had claimed innocence and stated that their assets were acquired through known sources.
NAB has alleged that during investigation, it was revealed that both the accused had accumulated huge assets worth millions of rupees disproportionate to their income.
As per the reference, the inquiry was authorised on Nov 4, 2015, that was subsequently converted into investigation with the approval of NAB executive board on Jan 12, 2018.
It is pertinent to mention that the most important changes made in the law in 2022 were amending section 5(O) of NAO following which the offence of ‘corruption and corrupt practices’ was defined as the one wherein the amount of embezzlement was of the value of not less than Rs500 million.
Following that amendment majority of the references were returned to NAB as the amount involved therein were less than Rs500 million.

14,PHC seeks ECP reply over allocation of PA reserved seat to JUI-F,PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court on Thursday issued notice to Election Commission of Pakistan for responding to a...,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court on Thursday issued notice to Election Commission of Pakistan for responding to a petition of Pakistan Muslim League-N challenging allotment of a reserved seat for non-Muslims to Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Syed Arshad Ali issued the order after preliminary hearing of the petition requesting for declaring as illegal the March 26 notification of ECP of declaring Gurpal Singh of JUI-F as returned candidate on one of the four seats reserved for non-Muslims.
Barrister Saqib Raza appeared for the petitioner whereas Barrister Kamran Murtaza represented JUI-F.
Barrister Saqib stated that there were four seats reserved for non-Muslims in KP Assembly which had to be filled under the constitution through proportional representation system of political parties’ lists of candidates on basis of total number of general seats won by each of the political party.
He stated that after the independent returned candidates joined political parties, both PML-N and JUI-F had seven members each in KP Assembly.
He stated that initially a notification was issued by ECP on March 4 through which one seat each was allocated to PML-N, JUI-F and PPPP, whereas it was mentioned in the notification that one reserved seat would be given by drawing lots between the petitioner-party and the JUI-F.
The counsel stated that subsequently in an arbitrary manner the number of seats of the petitioner were counted as six instead of seven and the fourth reserved seat was allotted to JUI-F instead of drawing lots.
The petitioner has also requested the court for granting interim relief by stopping the KP Assembly speaker from administering oath to Gurpal Singh till final disposal of the petition.
