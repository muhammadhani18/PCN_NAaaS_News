0,IMF insists on reforms as talks progress for new loan,Aurangzeb rules out sharp rupee devaluation with new bailout programme.,"WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) emphasised on Thursday that prioritising reforms to revitalise the Pakistani economy outweighs the size of the new loan package being negotiated.
“I think what is important at this stage is to accelerate the reforms, double down on the structure of reforms in order to provide Pakistan with its full potential of growth,” IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia Director Jihad Azour said at a news conference in Washington. 
The IMF official’s comment followed Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s recent announcement that Pakistan was pursuing a significant, extended loan package with the IMF.
If approved, the proposed three-year package, Pakistan’s 24th with the IMF, could range between $6 to $8 billion, marking the country’s largest loan to date.
While in Washington for the World Bank group’s spring meetings, Mr Aurangzeb emphasised Pakistan’s commitment to entering negotiations for a new agreement with the IMF during discussions with multilateral and bilateral donors.

Additionally, he reassured the IMF that Pakistan would vigorously implement the reforms pledged in the current programme ending this month and those outlined in the new package.
However, comments from IMF officials suggest that the Fund prefers certain reforms, such as privatising loss-making state enterprises, to be implemented before finalising the next package.
On Wednesday, Pakistan voiced its concerns to the United Nations regarding its exclusion from the IMF’s list of countries eligible for climate support. The finance minister also highlighted this issue during his engagements in Washington.
Ambassador Usman Jadoon, Pakistan’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, expressed during a UN meeting on Wednesday, “Yet, we were deeply disappointed to discover that we were neither eligible for the IMF ‘food shock window’, nor its Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).”
Mr Jadoon underscored Pakistan’s expectation of automatic inclusion in any mechanism established for international support, considering the country’s significant challenges posed by the changing climate.
During his discussions in Washington to attend the IMF and the World Bank spring meetings, the finance minister highlighted the government’s measures to strengthen the economy. 
Rupee  devaluation
In an interview with the Bloomberg news agency on Thursday, he clarified that a new IMF deal would not lead to rapid rupee devaluation.
He added that there would be no reason for the rupee to depreciate more than the range of about 6pc to 8pc in a typical year. Pakistan last devalued its currency in January 2023.
The minister said that while massive devaluations had accompanied some previous IMF loans and are often a condition of the lender’s programme, nothing comparable should be necessary this time.
“I don’t see the need for any step change,” Aurangzeb said, citing solid foreign exchange reserves, a stable currency, rising remittances and steady exports. “The only thing which can be a wild card, although in our projections we should be okay, is the oil price,” he said.
He said the government was looking to bolster industries, including agriculture and information technology, hoping it would help push the nation’s growth above 4pc in the coming years.
The Bloomberg report pointed out that Pakistan faced about $24bn in external financing needs in the fiscal year starting July. The finance minister, however, said Pakistan was in a “relatively good shape” to make those payments.
He further said that Pakistan expected an IMF mission to visit in May and would like to reach a staff-level agreement on the next loan by the end of June or early July, without specifying how much the country was seeking.
Earlier, the minister also met with US State Department officials Donald Lu and Elizabeth Horst, during which the latter reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to bolstering ties between the two countries.
A statement issued by the finance ministry early on Wednesday said  Assistant Secretary  Lu, and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Pakistan Horst met the finance minister at the WB headquarters in the US capital, “reaffirming Washington’s commitment to bolster Pak-US ties”.
The ministry said that the meeting focused on upgrading economic partnerships, with an emphasis on alternative energy, agriculture, climate resilience and the tech industry.
Aurangzeb briefed the US diplomats on Pakistan’s reform agenda, which includes broadening the tax base, streamlining the energy sector and privatisation.
“Identified American investment opportunities in information technology, renewables, agriculture and minerals extraction. Pakistan pledges close collaboration with US International Development Finance Corporation & Exim Bank for mutual development,” the finance ministry said.
Earlier, the finance minister also met the WB-IMF Pakistan Staff Association and briefed them about the country’s reform agenda.

1,Exports of textiles post meagre rise in March,The decline in growth was attributed to rising production costs due to higher energy prices and a liquidity crunch.,"ISLAMABAD: The country’s textile and clothing exports suffered a slowdown last month, reversing the trend of double-digit growth observed over the previous three consecutive months and indicating a decline in orders from international buyers.
The sector’s exports showed a paltry growth of 3.29 per cent to $1.299 billion in March over $1.257bn recorded in the same month last year, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) on Thursday.
On a month-on-month basis, the sector’s exports dipped 7.67pc.
In 9MFY24, however, textile and clothing exports shra­nk 0.25pc to $12.444bn from $12.476bn in the same period last year.
The decline in growth was attributed to rising production costs due to higher energy prices and a liquidity crunch. The textile industry has already warned the government that further decline is likely in case their grievances, including pending refunds, are not processed quickly.
The PBS data showed exports of readymade garments rose 3.92pc by value in March and 19.39pc by quantity, while knitwear grew 8.12pc by value and 19.58pc by quantity. Bed wear posted a growth of 9.36pc and 18.15pc, respectively.
Towel exports surged by 18.10pc by value and 22.39pc by quantity, whereas those of cotton cloth went up by 3.18pc and 29.63pc, respectively.
Yarn exports fell by over 36.09pc in March over the same month last year. The exports of made-up articles, excluding towels, increased by 17.49pc, and tents, canvas and tarpaulin went down by 36.09pc in March.
The import of textile machinery declined by 49pc  in March, a sign that expansion or modernisation projects were not a priority.
The import of synthetic fibre increased by 49.41pc, that of synthetic and artificial silk yarn by 36.07pc and other textile items by 98.06pc during the month. 
The import of raw cotton declined by 79.56pc. However, the import of second-hand clothes posted a growth of 29.49pc.
In the first nine months of FY24, total exports increased by 9.01pc to $22.93bn over the same period last year.
Oil imports 
Oil imports dipped by 7.63pc during the first nine months of FY24 to $12.08bn from $13.08bn a year ago, the PBS data showed.
According to PBS, import of petroleum products fell by 21.02pc in value during July-March and 13.38pc in quantity. Imports of crude oil increased by 11.65pc in quantity while the value increased by 3.26pc.
Import of mobile phones
Mobile phone imports surged by 181.26pc to $1.301bn in 9MFY24 from $462.70m over the same period last year. This represents the single largest share of overall machinery import value in the first nine months of FY24.
Other mobile apparatus saw a growth of 14.05pc to $321.93m in 9MFY24 from $282.271m last year.

2,Data shows first-ever fall in cellular users,Trend indicates telcos now prioritising data subscribers.,"KARACHI: For the first time in six years, the number of cellular subscribers in Pakistan has declined even though the penetration of 4G has increased across the country, according to data released on Thursday.
The total cellular subscriptions in Pakistan fell by over 3.7 million during 2023 to close at 190.9m, down 1.9pc from 194.6m in 2022, according to the annual ‘State of Apps’ report for Pakistan, jointly released by Data Darbar, a data and market intelligence platform and UAE streaming platform Begin.
As per the report, the dip in the number of cellular subscribers was the “first instance” in at least six years, “and possibly on record”.
“[This] is part of the telecom industry’s conscious drive to get rid of low-value customers and focus on segments with better monetary returns,” the report said, adding that this pivot means companies moving from voice to data subscribers.

Trend indicates telcos now prioritising data subscribers

An indication of this shift was the growth of mobile broadband subscriptions, which rose 7.5pc to 124.4m in FY23.
The growth was also supported by the falling price of mobile data, with the average cost of 1GB of data plunged by 71.4pc to Rs32.8, compared to Rs114 in 2018. The overall penetration of broadband — both fixed and mobile connections — increased to 53.6pc in 2023, up from 51pc the year before.
The report also showed that the government’s attempts to boost local mobile phone manufacturing failed to yield promising results.
It has been on a decline since 2021 when the PTI government issued the Mobile Manufacturing Policy in 2021 from 24.7m in 2021 to 21.9m in 2022 and 21.3m in 2023.
Mobile app outlook
The report also showed that Pakistanis downloaded 3.51bn apps in 2023, almost the same as 3.52bn downloads the year before.
TikTok remained the most popular app with 31.8m downloads, followed by Whatsapp Business and Facebook, with 23.9m and 23.4m downloads, respectively.
The total apps published by Pakistani developers continued its downward slide to just over 4,800 in 2023, down 11.4pc from the year before.
However, in terms of gaming apps, Pakistan stood in second place as the developers released almost 1,100 games across the two stores — PlayStore and iOS.
“With sustained uptick in the incorporation of new information technology companies, the industry is poised to grow over the coming years, particularly presenting a massive opportunity in export-oriented categories in games and applications,” the press release stated.

3,PTCL Group incurs Rs4.8bn net loss,The PTCL Group strengthened its position as a primary telecom service provider.,"ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: The PTCL Group posted a net loss of Rs4.8 billion for the quarter ending March 31, the board of directors announced on Thursday.
The statement issued after the board meeting said that during the January-March quarter, the PTCL Group strengthened its position as a primary telecom service provider.
The group’s revenues — Pakistan Telecomm­unication Company Ltd (PTCL), Ufone, and Ubank — increased by 14pc to Rs49bn compared to the previous year, mainly due to a strong performance in the consumer segment, boosted by significant growth in fixed broadband, mobile data, and business solutions.
PTCL’s revenue increased 13pc to Rs26bn, and its net profit was Rs431 million in the first quarter of 2024. On the other hand, Ufone’s revenue grew 27pc compared to the same period last year; however, the financial charges on the loans obtained by Ufone led the balance sheet to the red.
Meezan Bank’s profits surge 
Meezan Bank posted consolidated earnings of Rs25.54bn for the first quarter of 2024, a 65pc jump from the profit-after-tax (PAT) of Rs15.5bn in the same period last year.
In a stock filing on Thursday, the bank said its earnings per share (EPS) increased to Rs14.19 for the quarter compared to Rs8.63 in 1QCY23.
The board announced an interim cash dividend of Rs7 per share for the quarter ended on March 31.
UBL earns Rs16bn 
United Bank Ltd (UBL) posted a PAT of Rs16bn (EPS: Rs13.05) in 1QCY24, depicting an increase of 12pc year-on-year and 19pc quarter-on-quarter.
The bank’s earnings reached a peak this quarter, fuelled by a substantial QoQ rise in non-interest income despite a decrease in interest income. The bank announced a cash dividend of Rs11 per share.

4,Saudi moves closer to $1bn Reko Diq deal,"Manara “could announce that it’s reached a preliminary agreement on terms of a transaction as soon as the next few weeks"".","SAUDI Arabia is moving closer to a potential deal to acquire a minority stake in the Reko Diq gold and copper mining project, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
Manara Minerals Investment Company, backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, plans to invest at least $1 billion in the Reko Diq project, controlled by the Canadian mining firm Barrick Gold Corporation.
Manara “could announce that it’s reached a preliminary agreement on terms of a transaction as soon as the next few weeks, according to the people,” Bloomberg reported.
The Saudi company may increase its investment over time in the mine, which is part-owned by the Pakistan government. Deliberations are ongoing, and talks could still fall apart or be delayed.

5,Auto financing keeps plunging,"The total decline in the last 21 months stood at Rs128bn, down from Rs368bn, according to SBP data.","KARACHI: Consumers remained reluctant to avail costly auto financing, which consequently plunged for the 21st consecutive month ending March 2024 to Rs239 billion, down by 1.4 per cent or Rs3.5bn month-on-month. 
According to data issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the total decline in the last 21 months stood at Rs128bn, down from Rs368bn at the end of June 2022.
Expensive financing, due to a 22 per cent interest rate, high monthly loan instalments, and the unbearable prices of vehicles, coupled with consumers’ thin buying power and the SBP’s curbs on financing to soften vehicle demand, have collectively impacted car financing.
Sales of cars, LCVs, pickups, and jeeps totalled 69,078 units during 9MFY24, down from 110,898 in the same period last fiscal year. 
Auto assemblers have attempted to lure customers through various incentive schemes such as lower mark-up rate options, attractive sales packages, after-sales services, and discounts on vehicle registration, but they have failed to attract a large number of buyers.
A private banker noted that auto financing has been slow for both new and used cars, with used car prices reaching levels comparable to locally assembled vehicles.

7,Stocks close in red for third consecutive session,The chief concern for the economic stakeholders remains the uncertainty about the outcome of the ongoing talks with the IMF.,"KARACHI: Despite massive foreign buying on Thursday, the stock market turned in a depressed performance amid the widening of the fiscal deficit and dismal auto sales data, forcing the benchmark KSE 100 index to close in the red for the third consecutive session. 
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the market remained under pressure amid a slump in global crude oil prices and steady government treasury bond yields, which dimmed rate cut hopes.
Automobile sales fell 38pc year-on-year in July-March, the fiscal deficit swelled to 7.4pc of GDP for FY24, and the weak rupee and SBP fines on blue-chip commercial banks for regulatory violations fuelled the bearish sentiments.
However, the chief concern for the economic stakeholders remains the uncertainty about the outcome of the ongoing talks with the International Monetary Fund for a new, larger and longer Extended Fund Facility.
As a result, the benchmark KSE 100 index scaled an intraday high of 70,645.30, gaining 311.98 points, and a low of 69,783.32, losing 550 points. However, it closed at 70,290.12 points after shedding another 43.20 points, or 0.06pc from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume slightly eased by 0.40pc to 440.31 million shares. However, the traded value surged by 51.93pc to Rs24.36bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Cnergyico PK Ltd (33.24m shares), K-Electric (29.87m shares), Pak Refinery (28.44m shares), PTCL (24.39m shares) and Worldcall Telecom (23.69m shares).
The shares registering the most significant decre­ases in their share prices in absolute terms were Nestle Pakistan (Rs52.50), Hoechst Pakistan (Rs50.00), Shahmurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs22.59), Lucky Cement (Rs12.38) and Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (Rs11.37).
The companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs81.10), Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs52.00), Sazgar Engineering Works Ltd (Rs29.17), Premium Textile Mills Ltd (Rs23.00) and National Refinery Ltd (Rs16.57).
The market witnessed aggressive buying from foreign investors as their net buying of shares swelled to $23.3m.
