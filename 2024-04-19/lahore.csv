0,Motorcyclist killed by Punjab CM’s motorcade in Narowal,"Maryam was going to Kartarpur for Baisakhi festival when Elite Force vehicle hit the 23-year-old, his family says.","NAROWAL: A speeding vehicle of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s motorcade allegedly killed a motorcyclist at the Chandowal Stop on the Shakargarh Road on Thursday.
The CM was going to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur to participate in the three-day celebrations of the Baisakhi festival. Her motorcade was going from Narowal to Kartarpur when the Elite Force vehicle hit the motorcyclist coming from the opposite direction. The motorcyclist, identified as 23-year-old Abubakar, a resident of Jassar town, died on the spot.
Despite the accident, the CM’s motorcade did not stop to take the injured to the hospital.
Ali Rizwan, a cousin of the deceased, told Dawn that Abubakar was going from home to a filling station where he was employed. He lamented that no official stopped their car to help the injured Abubakar and neither of them picked him or even called Rescue 1122. Instead, he lamented, the police officers came to the spot after the incident and washed the blood from the road with water to remove the evidence.
Abubakar’s mother Arifa Bibi said the police car had killed her son who was supporting the family during the hard times of inflation. She said her husband, Fakhar Ayaz, was a labourer.

She sought justice from CM Maryam Nawaz, saying that an FIR should be registered against the person responsible for the accident and he should be arrested.
Abubakar’s father Fakhar Ayaz fainted on the shock of the sudden death of his son. He was shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, Narowal, where he remained under treatment for a couple of hours.
District Emergency Officer Muhammad Naeem Akhtar claimed that Rescue 1122 motorcycles and ambulances reached the site immediately on receiving information of the accident but the victim had died on the spot.
He said Rescue 1122 had shifted the body to the District Headquarters Hospital, Narowal.
District Police Officer Muhammad Naveed Malik told Dawn that two persons, Abubakar and Hamza, were riding the motorcycle and that they were coming from Jassar Town to Narowal when a high-speed motorcycle coming from behind hit them. Abubakar fell on the right side while Hamza on the left side due to the collision of the motorcycles.
The DPO said Abu Bakar, who had fallen on the right side of the road, was hit by the vehicle and died in the accident.
To a question, the DPO could not identify the third motorcyclist who had hit Abubakar and Hamza’s bike, saying the police were trying to identify him. About Hamza, the DPO claimed that he had received minor scratches on the face.
The eyewitnesses, Muhammad Aslam and Attaullah, rejected the police version, saying that there was only one person (Abubakar), riding the bike while the police vehicle was overtaking him.
Abubakar’s cousin Rizwan also denied the statement of the police officers, saying that only Abubakar was riding the motorcycle. He alleged that the police were lying to protect the police driver responsible for the accident.
Rana Lal Badshah, former president of the District Bar Association, Narowal, and a leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), said a judicial inquiry should be conducted into the incident.
The Saddar Police Station registered an FIR against the unidentified driver of the police vehicle on the complaint of Ali Rizwan. The police took the body into custody and completed the post-mortem and necessary legal proceedings at the District Headquarters Hospital, Narowal, before handing it over to the family.

The Section 144 order has banned the carrying and display of all kinds of weapons including the licenced ones, except those by the law enforcement agencies (LEAs); all types of firing; and violation of any clause of the code of conduct issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan.
The order issued by Punjab Home Secretary NooruI Amin Mengal says the ban has been imposed because a large number of political gatherings, rallies, and corner meetings ions are likely to be held which may serve as soft targets for any desperate act by terrorists and miscreants.
The order also says that the possibility of clashes between contesting candidates and rival political parties/groups in different areas, given the past history, cannot be ruled out and may pose threats to public peace and order in the province.
“The ensuing security milieu demands extraordinary vigilance and extensive measures to preempt any untoward incident, in the larger interest of internal security,” says the order.

Justice Shahid Karim dismissed the petition as not maintainable and observed that unnecessary litigation wastes the court’s time.
A citizen, Mashkoor Hussain, filed the petition alleging that Imam Bibi Maternity Hospital, Sialkot, which was named after the mother of national poet Dr Allama Iqbal, has been renamed after the late father of Defence Minister Khwaja Asif as Khwaja Safdar Hospital.
The petitioner’s counsel Nadeem Sarwar stated that the conduct of the provincial government and functionaries shows that the cities, towns, streets and all public institutions are treated as part of some undeclared kingdoms of local feudal and political lords.
He pleaded that naming and renaming the institutions, towns, cities, roads and streets is also part of their kingdom rule, which depicts the mindset of our politicians and ruling elites.
He argued that the public institutions and infrastructures are not the property of the government as they belong to all citizens. He says there is no logic in naming or renaming the public places after the politicians and others.
He asks the court to declare that naming, renaming any street, road, government institute, town, or city after the name of any individual having no positive social role, courage or exceptional dedication to service is illegal, unlawful against the basic rights of citizens of respective areas.
The petitioner also furnished a list of 23 public places, hospitals and schools named after different politicians, including former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.

Dawn learnt that wheat crop is still in the harvesting process in most parts of the division and it remained unaffected with the recent rain that has delayed threshing for about a week or so, provided more rain does not hit the fi elds and weather conditions improve.
Talking to Dawn, Director Agriculture (extension) Bahawalpur Division Hafi z Jamil Ahmed Ghauri says that the rain was scattered in the division areas during the last week and hence all areas are not affected.
He has expressed his satisfaction with the wheat crop condition but saying that there is about 16pc moisture in the crop, which has compelled the farmers to suspend harvesting and threshing for some days.
Mr Ghauri says that about 40pc of the crop was harvested before the rain while about 60pc of wheat is still lying in the fi elds or it is yet to be harvested.
He says that a bumper crop is expected in Bahawalpur division this year with the total production to be 4.5 million metric tonnes with an average production of 38 to 40 maunds per acre yield. He says wheat was cultivated on the area of 2.7m acres in the division.

The deceased, a BS History 4th semester student, collapsed and was immediately taken to Nishtar Hospital, Multan, where she was pronounced dead upon arrival. The cause of her death remains unknown.

NAB Prosecutor Waris Ali Janjua told the court that suspect Habib Qasim, a sub-engineer, agreed to a plea bargain of Rs6.7 million with the prosecution. He said the NAB chairman approved the plea bargain of the suspect.
He pointed out that the suspect had also deposited 40 per cent of the total amount in the account of the bureau, while the remainder would be paid later.
The prosecutor said the bureau would not oppose the release of the suspect on bail.
Judge Zubair Shahzad Kiyani approved the plea bargain and ordered the release of the suspect.
The judge once again delayed the indictment of Mr Elahi and other suspects of the reference due to the absence of the former.
The judge was informed that the doctors at Adiala Jail had advised the former chief minister against a long travel from Rawalpindi to Lahore due to his medical condition.
The judge adjourned the hearing till May 9.
The NAB alleged that Muhammad Khan Bhatti, the principal secretary to then chief minister Parvez Elahi, manoeuvred the award of contracts in favour of blue-eyed contractors in connivance with other suspects, including the officials of government departments.
It said the suspect released full payment to the contractors even before the commencement of construction work only to receive kickbacks.
The bureau alleged that money from the corruption committed by Bhatti had been transferred into the bank accounts of Mr Elahi and his son, Moonis Elahi.
Separately, a special court also deferred the indictment of Mr Elahi and other suspects in a case of illegal appointments in the Punjab Assembly.

14,An initiative to check child mortality in hospitals,LAHORE: In response to the pressing need for accessible and high-quality emergency healthcare for children in...,"LAHORE: In response to the pressing need for accessible and high-quality emergency healthcare for children in Pakistan, an organisation has introduced an innovative telemedicine network in district and tehsil hospitals of Punjab, providing critical consultations to children in remote areas.
The initiative aims to address the alarming child mortality rates in the country, with 1,000 children losing their lives daily due to various illnesses.
The experts say with two-thirds of Pakistan’s population residing in rural areas, many families face significant challenges in accessing specialised medical care for their children.
They say financial constraints, logistical difficulties, and the sheer distance to major cities often deter families from seeking timely medical attention.
On average, families must spend Rs50,000 to travel to tertiary care hospitals in major cities, worsening the burden on already vulnerable households.
Recognising these challenges, the ChildLife Foundation has pioneered a provider-to-provider telemedicine model, deploying high-definition cameras, IP phones, and registered nurses at telemedicine sites across Punjab.
Through this innovative approach, children in remote areas receive consultations from FCPS Peads emergency specialists stationed at the control room in Lahore.
In 60 per cent of cases, these consultations result in value-added interventions, including training for on-ground government doctors on the latest medical protocols and interventions.
“This telemedicine initiative is a game-changer for children in remote areas who previously lacked access to timely and quality emergency care,” stated Dr. Ahson Rabbani, CEO at ChildLife Foundation. “By leveraging technology, we are bringing critical medical expertise directly to the doorstep of those who need it most, saving lives and alleviating the burden on families,” he said.
In Punjab alone, 90 telemedicine sites are currently operational, providing consultations to children with critical illnesses. Additionally, ChildLife Foundation manages 13 children’s emergency rooms under public-private partnerships with the government, spanning across Sindh, Balochistan, Islamabad, and Mayo Hospital and Children’s Hospital in Lahore and Multan, respectively. These emergency rooms are equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure, latest life-saving equipment, and a fully stocked pharmacy with a 45-day supply of essential medicines.
He said the holistic approach of the organisation is encompassing a scalable and cost-effective model operating in 313 hospitals nationwide in partnership with the government. With emergency rooms in tertiary care hospitals and Telemedicine Satellite Centres in secondary care hospitals, the foundation aims to provide free-of-cost treatment to two million children this year, ensuring that every child has access to life-saving medical care, regardless of their geographic location or financial circumstances.
