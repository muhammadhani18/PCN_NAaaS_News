The Tuesday demonstration was organised by the group  “No Tech for Apartheid,” which has long opposed  “Project Nimbus,” Google’s joint $1.2 billion contract with Amazon to provide cloud services to the government of Israel.
Video of the demonstration showed police arresting Google workers in Sunnyvale, California, in the office of Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian’s, according to a post by the advocacy group on X, formerly Twitter.
Kurian’s office was occupied for 10 hours, the advocacy group said.
Workers held signs including  “Googlers against Genocide,” a reference to accusations surrounding Israel’s attacks on Gaza.
“No Tech for Apartheid,” which also held protests in New York and Seattle, pointed to an April 12 Time magazine article reporting a draft contract of Google billing the Israeli Ministry of Defence more than $1 million for consulting services.
A  “small number” of employees  “disrupted” a few Google locations, but the protests are  “part of a longstanding campaign by a group of organisations and people who largely don’t work at Google,” a Google spokesperson said.

AMSTERDAM: Reuters photographer Mohammed Salem won the prestigious 2024 World Press Photo of the Year award on Thursday for his image of a Palestinian woman cradling the body of her five-year-old niece in the Gaza Strip.
The picture was taken on Oct 17, 2023, at Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza, where families were searching for relatives killed during Israeli bombing of the Palestinian enclave.
Salem’s winning image portrays Inas Abu Maamar, 36, sobbing while holding Saly’s sheet-clad body in the hospital morgue.
“Mohammed Salem received the news of his WPP award with humility, saying that this is not a photo to celebrate but that he appreciates its recognition and the opportunity to publish it to a wider audience,” Reuters Global Editor for Pictures and Video, Rickey Rogers, said at a ceremony in Amsterdam.
“He hopes with this award that the world will become even more conscious of the human impact of war, especially on children,” Rogers said, standing in front of the photo at the Nieuwe Kerk in the Dutch capital.

Announcing its annual awards, the Amsterdam-based World Press Photo Foundation said it was important to recognise the dangers facing journalists covering conflicts. It said 99 journalists and media employees had been killed covering the Israeli aggression.
“The work of press and documentary photographers around the world is often done at high risk,” said Joumana El Zein Khoury, the organisation’s executive director.
“This past year, the death toll in Gaza pushed the number of journalists killed to a near-record high. It is important to recognise the trauma they have experienced to show the world the humanitarian impact of the war.”  Salem, a Palestinian aged 39, has worked for this news agency since 2003. He also won an award in the 2010 World Press Photo competition.
The jury selected the winning photos from 61,062 entries by 3,851 photographers from 130 countries.
The jury said Salem’s 2024 winning image was  “composed with care and respect, offering at once a metaphorical and literal glimpse into unimaginable loss.” “I felt the picture sums up the broader sense of what was happening in the Gaza Strip,” Salem said when the image was first published in Nov.
“People were confused, running from one place to another, anxious to know the fate of their loved ones, and this woman caught my eye as she was holding the body of the little girl and refused to let go.” Salem’s wife had given birth to their child days before he took the shot. The photograph is  “profoundly affecting,” said jury me­m­ber Fiona Shields, head of photography at Guardian News & Media.

2,13 environment journalists killed in India during Modi rule: RSF,"""Protecting journalists and combating impunity for crimes of violence against them should be at the centre of the elections,"" RSF says.","NEW DELHI: Journalists investigating the exploitation of natural resources by the sand mafias or other networks involved in mining have been the victims of violent reprisals during the past 10 years, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) media watchdog said on Thursday.
Filing its report to coincide with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 10 years in office and on the eve of India’s five-yearly general elections starting today, RSF hoped to catch the eye of the candidates in the fray.
It said: “Nearly half of the 28 journalists killed in India since Narendra Modi took over as prime minister ten years ago, including media directors, investigative reporters and correspondents, were working on stories linked to the environment.”
India starts months-long seven-stage elections on Friday. RSF chose the time to state its case. “Protecting journalists and combating impunity for crimes of violence against them should be at the centre of the elections in which Modi is seeking another term.”.
At least 13 of the 28 journalists killed since 2014 were working on environmental-related subjects, mainly land seizures and illegal mining for industrial purposes. The report said several were killed for taking an interest in India’s so-called sand mafia, an organised crime network that excavates sand illegally for the country’s booming construction industry.
“Closely linked to politicians and often protected by them, the mafia is quick to silence journalists who take too close an interest in its activities, and does so with complete impunity,” RSF said.

3,"Kenya’s defence chief, 9 others die in helicopter crash",NAIROBI: Kenya’s defence chief and nine other senior military officers died in a helicopter crash in a remote area...,"NAIROBI: Kenya’s defence chief and nine other senior military officers died in a helicopter crash in a remote area of the country on Thursday, President William Ruto announced.
“Today at 2:20pm, our nation suffered a tragic air accident... I am deeply saddened to announce the passing on of General Francis Omondi Ogolla,” Ruto told reporters, adding that nine other officers were also killed while two survived.
He said the Kenya Air Force has dispatched an air investigation team to establish the cause of the crash, which took place in Elgeyo Marakwet county, about 400 kilometres (250 miles) northwest of the capital Nairobi.
“A distinguished four-star general has fallen in the course of duty and in the service of the country,” Ruto said, announcing three days of mourning from Friday.“The helicopter burst into flames after crashing and it had  more than 10 senior commanders on board including General Ogolla,” a source said.
“They were in the area on a security mission because  there are KDF (Kenya Defence Forces) soldiers deployed in the region,”  he said.Ogolla, 61, was appointed Chief of the Defence Forces by Ruto in April last year after a stint as deputy.
Ruto  told journalists last May that he appointed Ogolla despite him being  among those who tried to overturn his narrow election win against  opposition leader Raila Odinga in 2022.
“When I looked at his CV,  he was the best person to be (a) general,” Ruto said, adding his  decision went against the wishes of many people.

4,Trump’s hush money trial loses two jurors,"NEW YORK: The judge overseeing former US president Donald Trump’s criminal trial dismissed two jurors on Thursday,...","NEW YORK: The judge overseeing former US president Donald Trump’s criminal trial dismissed two jurors on Thursday, as lawyers struggled to assemble a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates for one of the most high-profile trials in American history.
Justice Juan Merchan excused one juror after prosecutors said he may not have disclosed prior brushes with the law. Merchan did not specify why he dismissed that juror.
The judge had previously excused a juror who said she felt intimidated because some personal information had been made public. She said family, friends and colleagues had contacted her after deducing she was on the jury.
“I don’t believe at this point that I can be fair and unbiased, and let the outside influences not affect my decision-making in the courtroom,” the juror said. The two removals mean that five people so far have been selected for the jury.
The decisions highlighted the extraordinary pressures around the first criminal trial ever of a former US president. Trump is one of the most controversial figures in American politics, and roughly half of the 192 potential jurors screened so far in heavily Democratic Manhattan have been dismissed after saying they could not impartially assess his guilt or innocence.
The Republican presidential candidate in the Nov 5 election is accused of covering up a $130,000 payment his former lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says they had a decade earlier.
Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and denies any such encounter with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.
He has also pleaded not guilty in three other criminal cases against him in Washington, Georgia and Florida.
The New York trial could be the only one he faces before the election. A conviction would not bar Trump, the Republican presidential candidate in the Nov 5 election, from running for or taking office.
Trump says, without providing evidence, that all four criminal cases are part of a broad-ranging effort by allies of Democratic President Joe Biden to hobble his candidacy. Officials in some of those cases have reported receiving death threats and harassment after being criticised by Trump.
Merchan has taken steps to shield jurors in the case from harassment, saying they will remain anonymous except to Trump, his lawyers and prosecutors. On Thursday, he said he would prohibit news outlets from reporting on aspects of potential jurors’ employment.
He has also imposed a partial gag order on Trump, who has criticised him, witnesses, and prosecutors and their relatives. Prosecutors say Trump has violated the gag order seven times since they flagged three potential violations on Monday, and have asked Merchan to impose fines or other penalties.
On Thursday, prosecutor Christopher Conroy pointed to posts about former Trump attorney Cohen, who is expected to be a star prosecution witness, and a post saying undercover liberal activists had been lying to the judge to try to get on the jury.
One of Trump’s lawyers, Emil Bove, said those posts  “do not establish any willful violations” of the gag order.

5,WHO defines spread of  disease ‘through air’,"Almost 500 experts contributed to the definition, including physicists, public health professionals and engineers.","LONDON: The World Health Organisation and around 500 experts have agreed for the first time what it means for a disease to spread through the air, in a bid to avoid the confusion early in the Covid-19 pandemic that some scientists have said cost lives.
The Geneva-based UN health agency released a technical document on the topic on Thursday. It said it was the first step towards working out how to better prevent this kind of transmission, both for existing diseases like measles and for future pandemic threats.
The document concludes that the descriptor  “through the air” can be used for infectious diseases where the main type of transmission involves the pathogen travelling through the air or being suspended in the air, in line with other terms such as  “waterborne” diseases, which are understood across disciplines and by the public.
Almost 500 experts contributed to the definition, including physicists, public health professionals and engineers, many of whom disagreed bitterly over the topic in the past.
Agencies have historically required high levels of proof before calling diseases airborne, which required very stringent containment measures; the new definition says the risk of exposure and severity of disease should also be considered.

6,Australian PM considers citizenship for Pakistani guard injured in attack,SYDNEY: Australia’s prime minister said on Thursday he would consider granting citizenship to a Pakistani security...,"SYDNEY: Australia’s prime minister said on Thursday he would consider granting citizenship to a Pakistani security guard wounded in the deadly Sydney shopping centre knife attack.
The guard, Muhammad Taha, reportedly said he believed he “deserved recognition and consideration for citizenship” after being stabbed.
In a bedside interview with The Australian, Taha said he was attacked just after fellow Pakistani security guard Faraz Tahir, one of the six people killed at the Westfield shopping complex in Bondi Junction.
Taha has a graduate visa due to expire in less than a month, the paper said.
The guard reportedly noted that Frenchman Damien Guerot, since dubbed “bollard man”, had been offered permanent residency after video shared on social media showed him using a bollard to fend off the attacker, Joel Cauchi.
Asked in a radio interview if the Australian government would entertain Taha’s citizenship request, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said: “Yes, we certainly will.” Albanese described the killing of Faraz Tahir as a  “tragedy”.
“This other person, Muhammad Taha, he confronted this guy, the perpetrator, Joel Cauchi, on Saturday. 
And it just shows extraordinary courage,” the prime minister said.
Both men put themselves in danger to protect Australians they did not know, Albanese said.

7,Fossils of colossal snake unearthed in Indian mine,"Scientists say the snake, which they named Vasuki indicus, would have looked like a modern-day large python and would not have been venomous.","

WASHINGTON: Fossil vertebrae unearthed in a lignite mine are the remains of one of the largest snakes that ever lived, a monster estimated at up to 49 feet (15 metres) in length — longer than a T. rex — that prowled the swamps of India around 47 million years ago.
Scientists said on Thursday they have recovered 27 vertebrae from the snake, including a few still in the same position as they would have been when the limbless reptile was alive. They said the snake, which they named Vasuki indicus, would have looked like a modern-day large python and would not have been venomous.
The mine is located in the Panandhro area of the Kutch district in western India’s state of Gujarat. Lignite is the lowest grade of coal.
“Considering its large size, Vasuki was a slow-moving ambush predator that would subdue its prey through constriction like anacondas and pythons. This snake lived in a marshy swamp near the coast at a time when global temperatures were higher than today,” said Debajit Datta, a postdoctoral researcher in paleontology at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IITR) and lead author of the study published in the journal Scientific Reports.
Because of the incomplete nature of the Vasuki remains, the researchers gave an estimated length range of 36-49 feet (11-15 metres) and a rough estimate of a metric ton in weight.
Vasuki, named after the snake king associated with the Hindu deity Shiva, rivals in size another huge prehistoric snake called Titanoboa, whose fossils were discovered in a coal mine in northern Colombia, as announced in 2009. Titanoboa, estimated at 42 feet (13 metres) long and 1.1 metric tons, lived 58-60 million years ago. The reticulated python is the longest extant snake, sometimes measuring 20-30 feet (6-9 metres).
“The estimated body length of Vasuki is comparable to that of Titanoboa, although the vertebrae of Titanoboa are slightly larger than those of Vasuki. 
However, at this point, we cannot say if Vasuki was more massive or slender compared to Titanoboa,” said paleontologist and study co-author Sunil Bajpai, a professor at IITR.
These huge snakes lived during the Cenozoic era, which began after the dinosaur age ended 66 million years ago. Perhaps the largest-known Tyrannosaurus rex is a specimen named Sue at the Field Museum in Chicago, at 40-1/2 feet (12.3 metres) long, though a T. rex would have been more massive than these snakes.

8,Princess Diana’s dresses on display in Hong Kong ahead of auction,"HONG KONG: Shoulder-padded, daffodil yellow and accented with gleaming gold buttons — a very of-its-time suit...","HONG KONG: Shoulder-padded, daffodil yellow and accented with gleaming gold buttons — a very of-its-time suit Princess Diana wore during her 1989 trip to Hong Kong is now among six outfits on display in the former British colony.
The collection of dresses, shoes and handbags — some of which are familiar fashion moments from the Princess of Wales — is part of a 12-day exhibit at a Hong Kong mall which launched on Thursday.
They will then be on display in Ireland at another exhibit before going on auction on June 27.
“She made a fashion statement every time she got dressed and went out the door,” Martin Nolan, executive director of California-based Julien’s Auctions, said. The yellow suit, designed by Catherine Walker, is estimated to fetch up to $50,000 — a fraction of the $400,000 that a midnight blue star-embellished tulle gown is expected to bring at the auction block. Diana had worn the showstopping number designed by Murray Arbeid to the 1986  “Phantom of the Opera” premiere in London’s West End. Visitors milled about the small, pop-up space on Thursday, pausing every once in a while to take a closer read of an outfit’s history.
Remembering Diana’s visit in 1989, an elderly shopper surnamed Fung said the streets of Hong Kong were crowded with people hoping to catch a glimpse of the glamourous royal.
The 65-year-old added that the city’s affection for her went beyond the usual fanfare for other British royals. “Diana was charismatic, caring and devoted to charity. That’s why a lot of Hong Kongers respected her,” Fung said.
