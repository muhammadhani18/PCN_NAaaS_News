| 16 arrested over non-compliance with notified rates
RAWALPINDI: The district administration on Thursday arrested 16 naanbais for not complying with new rates of Roti and Naan as tandoors across the garrison city observed a partial strike against the government’s move to reduce the prices of Roti.
The strike was observed on the call of the All Pakistan Naan-bai Association and is likely to continue today as well. On the other hand, the district administration warned they would seal the shops if the tandoors remained closed on Friday and the new price list was not followed.
Last week, the Punjab government reduced the price of Roti from Rs20 to Rs16 while the price of Naan was reduced from Rs25 to Rs20 in the province. However, the move was rejected by the naan-bai association which said the decision was taken by the government without consultations with the stakeholders.
The refusal of the tandoor owners to follow the government prices was met with high-handedness. The president of the naan-bai association was detained under the MPO and many naan-bais were arrested for violating the notification. Fines were also imposed.
According to a report submitted to the Punjab government on Thursday, the district administration teams visited different bazaars and markets and imposed fines to the tune of Rs243,500 on 59 tandoors and arrested 16 violators. The administration warned the price magistrates that negligence would not be tolerated in the implementation of the new price for Roti.
Meanwhile, All Pakistan Naan-bai Association General Secretary Khursheed Qureshi told Dawn the tandoors remained closed on Thursday as they refused to accept the new price list issued by the Punjab government.
“The district administration must release the association president Shafique Qureshi who was detained under MPO four days ago. It is not possible for tandoors to sell Roti at Rs16 as the production cost is more than Rs18; how is it possible to sell Roti for Rs16,” he said.
He said that the price of flour, natural gas, and LPG has increased, adding that the tandoors run on natural gas had a much higher cost. “The price of wheat flour has reduced, but not so much that we reduce the price of Roti,” he said. In many areas of the garrison city, tandoors remained closed during the day. “We brought roti from home as the tandoor owners informed us that they will not open their shops on Thursday,” said Muhammad Rafique, a shopkeeper in Chaklala Scheme-III.
Intikhab Khan, who runs a tandoor on Bostan Khan Road, said his shop was closed on the call of the naan-bai association. He said that tandoors would remain closed till their demands were met. On the other hand, the district administration remained active in the garrison city and imposed fines on those who failed to implement the new price of Roti.
A senior official said the district administration warned the naanbais that their shops would be sealed if they failed to open them on Friday and did not follow the new list. He said that the roti price would be implemented in the district within a day or two and people would get Roti at the notified rate. He claimed that the price of wheat flour had reduced and the cost of Roti was less than Rs13.

1,Marwat sticks to his guns on S. Arabia after party backs off,"ISLAMABAD: Toeing the party line, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MNA Sher Afzal Marwat on Thursday said that his...","ISLAMABAD: Toeing the party line, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MNA Sher Afzal Marwat on Thursday said that his statement about the alleged role of Saudi Arabia in the 2022 ouster of the Imran Khan government was based on his personal opinion, but sticking to his earlier stance, he declared that the notion of Saudi Arabia being a brotherly Islamic country was mere self-deception by Pakistanis.
Mr Marwat was talking to the media outside the Parliament House after participating in the noisy protest during President Asif Zardari’s address to the joint sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate.
The PTI MNA, who is known for causing controversies, came in the spotlight again when his party publicly distanced itself from his statement in which he had accused both the US and Saudi Arabia of conspiring to topple the PTI government.
Mr Marwat, a member of PTI’s political committee, had levelled the allegations in an interview on a private news channel amid a critical visit from a high-level Saudi delegation to Pakistan. He had also claimed that Saudi Arabia was influenced by the US in regional matters.
When asked about his previous statement, the PTI leader owned it, adding that they were his own views and he had an understanding of the issue.
When questioned on the premise of his understanding, Mr Marwat stated about the intellect capacity of parliamentarians and professionals.
“I have a basic understanding of things, and it is also based on common sense,” he said, adding, “Just look at the friendship between India and Saudi Arabia and see what they are doing for India and compare it with what they have done for us—all their favours to Pakistan are peanuts compared to the benefits given to India.”
Replying to a question that his statements are not being taken well by the leadership of his party, Mr Marwat noted, “My level of intellect is equal to that of yours, so whatever you say is okay.”
However, a day earlier, PTI leaders Zulfi Bukhari and Asad Qaiser tried to clarify the party’s position on the subject in separate statements. They expressed that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were united by shared values, culture, and a common vision for regional peace and prosperity.
Mr Bukhari, on his X (previously Twitter), said that the party had no reason whatsoever to say or believe in any kind of intervention from the kingdom.
He added that PTI chairman Imran Khan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have a relationship of mutual respect, trust, and brotherhood.

4,"Education emergency on the cards, British envoy told",Minister says national agenda needed to tackle issue of out of school children in Pakistan,"ISLAMABAD: Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said on Wednesday that the ministry was working on a programme to declare an education emergency in the country to tackle the issue of out of school children (OOSC).
He stated this while talking to British High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott, who called on him at the ministry. The meeting was attended by Country Director British Council James Hampson and Secretary Education Mohyuddin Wani.
The minister said the number of OOSC in Pakistan was ballooning and the only way to address the issue was by making it a national agenda. He said due to rapid and uncontrolled urbanisation and slums in major cities, the number of OOSC was increasing as slums were ignored in every education policy.
He highlighted the importance of ensuring that no child is left behind, says a press release. Mr Siddiqui urged the UK to provide support in the cause of eliminating out of school children. He said we need to bring all stakeholders especially donors on the same platform so that efforts can be channelled and streamlined.

Minister says national agenda needed to tackle issue of out of school children in Pakistan

The minister said various initiatives were being taken to bring improvement in the education sector, saying: “expense on education is not expenditure but investment.”
The British high commissioner said UK and Pakistan were the oldest partners and had been shoulder to shoulder since 1947. She said UK encouraged expansion of its green programme which can lead to an increase in enrolment of Pakistani students in UK universities via distance learning. She said Google Education was highly interested in supporting Pakistan in its bid to address the issue of access to education.
The high commissioner and the education minister also discussed the challenges and opportunities following the devolution of education to provinces.
The secretary education said the ministry was developing a comprehensive plan which will declare an education emergency in the country and align all stakeholders on the same page. He said all donors and NGOs operating in Pakistan were working in silos and compartments.
Earlier, the minster while talking about youth said, “we have set a target to train one million youth in the IT sector.”
He hoped that in the medium term, Pakistan will become one of the biggest suppliers of IT professionals to the world. He asked the UK to help in attaining IT certification for IT trained professionals that would be recognised globally.
The minister said the ministry aims to establish mental health awareness and support desks in all colleges in Islamabad.
The country director British Council told the minister that after China the biggest British Council Programme was in Pakistan. He said the global chief executive of British Council will be visiting Pakistan in May.
The minister welcomed the initiative from the British Council and expressed the desire to enhance collaboration between the council and Pakistan, especially with respect to increasing educational outreach programmes for slums in metropolitan cities of the country.

5,Mystery shrouds killing of woman from Pakpattan,GUJAR KHAN: Mystery shrouds the killing of a woman belonging to Pakpattan whose body was found lying alongside the ...,"GUJAR KHAN: Mystery shrouds the killing of a woman belonging to Pakpattan whose body was found lying alongside the GT Road near Lehry forests in the jurisdiction of Sohawa police on March 11.
The mutilated body with stab wounds and acid burns was later buried by the police declaring it “unidentified”. The police then registered a case on its own and started investigations.
Station House Officer (SHO) Inspector Ahsan Butt told Dawn that the police after matching her fingerprints with Nadra records identified the deceased as Tahira Nosheen Rana, a resident of Chak-33 SP, Pakpattan. She turned out to be a journalist attached with a local Urdu paper.
He said her heirs were also traced and her brother approached the police and claimed that she had not been in contact with the family since 2018 after she got divorced from her first husband and married to another man. He said the first husband of his sister had died and she had a daughter from him.
According to the SHO, her brother requested that the police let her body remain buried in the Sohawa graveyard.
Replying to a question, the SHO said that the woman’s second husband had also been contacted and would join the investigation soon. He said three criminal cases were found registered against the deceased in Pakpattan and Lahore police stations while she was also a complainant and a witness in several cases.
In an interview available on Facebook with a journalist in Islamabad, the deceased had stated that her second husband had already married five women and had contracted his seventh marriage after marrying her.
“This is a gang very active in Lahore that lures well-settled women after building relationships with them to get financial benefits,” she had alleged in the interview. In the video, she also alleged that her husband had subjected her to assault and blackmailing after she applied for Khula.
“He had also kept me hostage for four months at different places and recorded my obscene videos after intoxicating me and sent them to my family and friends”, she alleged in the video.
Talking about cases registered against her, she claimed that her husband had given her cheques after faking her signatures to different people while she was kept hostage, adding his aim was to confiscate her property. She alleged that her husband had also attempted to take her life multiple times. She also claimed that her husband had made a plan to put the blame of her death on her brother and other family members. She had also soiught justice and protection from the authorities.
Interestingly, in another video statement recorded earlier on April 9, 2023, she had claimed that she and her husband were receiving life threats from her family members, including her brother. She had also claimed in the video that she was having property disputes with her family members.

6,Enforcement of anti-tobacco laws demanded,"ISLAMABAD: The regulated tobacco sector has demanded the enforcement of anti-tobacco laws in the country, citing...","ISLAMABAD: The regulated tobacco sector has demanded the enforcement of anti-tobacco laws in the country, citing revenue loss and decline of legitimate industry due to the rampant increase in the sale of illicit cigarettes, while criticising the NGOs for not mentioning the illicit market in their anti-tobacco campaigns.
“There is a need to tackle the rising sale of low-priced, non-tax-paid cigarettes in the country; as a result, the regulated industry is witnessing declining sales,” Andleeb Uroos Ahmed, Head of Communications, Philip Morris Pakistan (PMP), said in a news conference.
The PMP team has highlighted that the company has witnessed a decrease of 86 per cent in total income during the financial year January–December 2023, due to high taxes on the regulated cigarettes industry and the price gap against illicit cigarettes.
She added that the massive surge in illegal cigarettes across Pakistan was witnessed after an increase in the federal excise duty (FED) in February ‘23. As a result, the illicit cigarette market share has reached 63 per cent of the total market in Pakistan.
The media was informed that there were three categories of illicit cigarettes on the market: smuggled packets mostly manufactured in the UAE with attractive packaging and a variety of flavours; non-registered local cigarettes; and counterfeit products of registered brands.
“All of these do not pay taxes; that is, their prices were less than half to one-third of the regulated cigarette brands,” Ms Uroos highlighted.
She said that the government has to enforce all the laws of the country on the cigarette industry, and the tax stamps of the track & trace system were introduced to combat illicit tobacco trade, but that too was not being implemented, and cigarette packs with fake tax stamps were openly being sold in the markets.
Responding to a question about the statements by various anti-tobacco organisations that increasing taxes on tobacco products was leading to a drop in smoking habits, she said that these organisations have been misguiding the government through misinformation.

Mohammad Ashraf Gondal, a resident of Rerka Bala village in Phalia tehsil of Mandi Bahauddin, told city police that he had been running a stockyard on the land of a local person in Mirpur for about 15 years, where his son Rafaqat Ali and nephews Hamid Iqbal and Azhar Iqbal were also lending him help.
On Thursday, when he was visiting a relative at some other place, seven suspects arrived in his stockyard at about 5:50am on motorcycles, and one of them, identified as Mubashar alias Baggu, opened fire on his son Rafaqat with a 30-bore pistol, Mr Gondal said.
Rafaqat sustained a bullet to his right wrist and rushed towards the fields to save himself, but in vain, he said, adding that Mubashar fired more shots at him, which caused his death on the spot.
All the suspects fled from the scene after committing the heinous crime, the complainants said.
He told the police that the enmity with the suspects was because of litigation over previous murders.
SSP Mirpur Kamran Ali told Dawn that the suspects had been booked under sections 302, 109, 337, and 34 of the Azad Penal Code.
“We will soon hunt them down to bring them to justice,” he said.

A senior official of the district administration told Dawn that the Land Revenue Department had been asked to start demarcation of the right of way of Soan River with the help of the Punjab Irrigation Department to remove encroachments along the river to avoid a flood-like situation in the coming monsoon season.
He said the river’s right of way was 300 to 350 metres, but the illegal units had been constructed on the banks which caused flooding in the local areas in the past. Under the law, he said, no construction could to be done along the river banks and its right of way, and it would only be used for farming purposes. However, he said, all the green areas along the river and seasonal nullahs in Rawalpindi were shrinking due to urban development.
The official further said the ground water level in the garrison city was depleting fast as the water recharge areas along the river were reducing.
Soan River is one of the major water bodies of the Potohar Plateau, passing through the heart of the garrison city and cultivating the region. The river is of immense importance to the city, but during recent times, it has been observed that the plains and right of way of the Soan River are heavily encroached and the water flow is obstructed, said the official.
He said the district administration had taken serious notice of the alarming situation of the right of way of the river and said it would be identified so that encroachment and constructions without permission would be dealt with accordingly. He said the no-construction zone had been established to protect the natural flow of the river.
When contacted, Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema said that he had directed a survey of the area along the Soan River to remove the encroachments. He said they would start surveying the area soon and their basic concern was to save the people’s lives.
“Due to the negligence of those who constructed illegal structures, many people have lost their lives, and it is not acceptable for the Punjab government,” he said.

10,Lobbying in full swing for Islamabad IGP post,Two DIGs vie for top slot amid reports of DIG Rizvi’s expected arrival,"ISLAMABAD: Even though the notification of DIG Ali Nasir Rizvi as the new police chief remains in the field, two senior police officers of the Islamabad police have stepped up efforts to clinch the coveted post with the help of senior bureaucrats in the interior ministry.
Insiders told Dawn that the two officers had held meetings with senior civil servants, including those serving in the interior ministry. They claimed that the two DIGs also visited the interior ministry separately and met a senior official at the ministry with a request to recommend their name for the post of the police chief.
The office of the IGP has been vacant since March 29 after the Establishment Division posted Akbar Nasir Khan and appointed DIG Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi as the new police chief of the capital police. The sources said that there were reports that Mr Rizivi was likely to assume the charge.
In this regard the interior minister, who picked DIG Rizvi for the top office, also said that the officer based in Lahore would join the office of the Islamabad police chief, they added. The notification for DIG Rizvi’s appointment is still not cancelled despite his reluctance because the minister wanted him to head the capital police. On March 29, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi accompanied DIG Rizvi and met the premier. After this meeting, the notification regarding his appointment as the IGP Islamabad was issued.

Two DIGs vie for top slot amid reports of DIG Rizvi’s expected arrival

There are several reasons DIG Rizvi has not arrived in the capital. For instance, he had wanted to bring his own team from Punjab, including DIGs and SSPs and the Punjab chief minister’s objections over his transfer.
It may be mentioned here that the capital police have four DIGs, including DIG Security Owais Ahmed, and DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza from CTP-29 and Safe City Authority Director General Mohammad Shoaib from CTP-30. DIG Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, however, is from CTP-31 and the senior officers in the police are reluctant to work under his command.
DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza, DIG Security Owais Ahmed, and Safe City head DIG Mohammad Shoaib had also approached the commissioner for a 15-day leave because they did not want to ‘salute’ a junior officer DIG Rizvi. The request for the leave was turned down and the application was returned to the DIGs.
The commissioner’s office asked them to approach the interior secretary to seek leave, saying the commissioner lost its powers to the interior secretary after the promulgation of the Police Order. After the leave request was rejected, the DIGs resumed their duties. It may be noted that the police officers had approached the administration for a 15-day leave after the approval of their five-day leave by the outgoing police chief.
Akbar Nasir Khan relinquished the charge on March 30 day without nominating an officer, as DIG Rizvi did not appear to assume the charge. On April 8, the chief commissioner’s office approached the interior ministry and requested to appoint the ‘most senior’ officer DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza as acting IGP Islamabad, as during the absence of the police chief the official work of the capital police was suffering. DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza, however, is junior to DIG Security Owais Ahmed in the seniority list of the CTP-29.

11,IHCBA wants meddling accusations by six judges probed to fix responsibility,"ISLAMABAD: Against the backdrop of March 25 letter by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges, the Islamabad High ...","ISLAMABAD: Against the backdrop of March 25 letter by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) on Thursday sought a probe for fixing liability against those responsible for undermining the independence of judiciary.
Moved through senior counsel Syed Ahmad Hassan Shah on behalf of IHCBA, a petition filed before the Supreme Court on Thursday also requested for delineating matters highlighted in the March 25 letter by six high court judges to suggest suitable recommendations for due consideration by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) that develops code of conduct for the judges.
Earlier on April 5, the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) had asked for a Judicial Commission manned by sitting judges of the Supreme Court to settle the complaints of meddling of the intelligence agencies in the judicial affairs.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, a seven-judge Supreme Court bench which initiated a suo motu on the issue will resume the hearing on April 30. A member of the bench Justice Yahya Afridi had already withdrawn himself from the bench.
Now the fresh petition pleaded that there was no room for any kind of interference, overt or covert, in the discharge of judicial functions by any court of law by any external element.
Intimidation or harassment of a judge of a high court or a judge of the court subordinate to it or those discharging quasi-judicial functions at a tribunal established by the law is not a fair game. It is an affront to constitutionalism and a brazen attack on the independence of judiciary, the petition argued.
The independence of judiciary, as a comprehensive constitutional construct, encompasses distinct aspects, including the independence of the judicature, as an organ of the state and independence of individual judges to decide all manner of cases before them in accordance with law.
The letter highlights grave concerns with respect to both, the petition reminded.
The multi-layered judicial structure under the Constitution is amenable to interference whatsoever, particularly from another organ of the state including the executive branch of the state as each organ must not encroach upon the constitutional domain of others.
The petition emphasized that within the established judicial hierarchy, each judge is independent and under oath to preserve, protects and defend the Constitution.
The faction motivated by vested political interests and personal gains that operate to erode public confidence in the administration of justice by spreading false information and unfairly targeting individual judges, whereby right-thinking members of the society are misguided and the lines between the rule of law and advocacy and pretence and personal benefit are blurred to undermine the independence of judiciary.
The petition emphasised the confidence on the justice system of Pakistan will erode, if the Supreme Court did not address the issues raised in the judge’s letter, adding in exercising of its original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, the apex court should intervene to secure independence of judiciary by addressing important questions of law.
The petition also questioned whether the media trial of individual judges in pending cases before the courts amounts to interference in judicial work or akin to influencing or interference in conduct of fair trial or cause disparagement or develops a sense of ridicule in the mind of the public for the judiciary.
The petition contended whether due process requirements enshrined in Article 10A of the Constitution warrants probe in to instances highlighted in the letter, particularly when the federal cabinet in its meeting of March 30, 2024 has denied any involvement.
Whether the code of conduct prescribed by SJC is deficient in providing guidelines to deal with instances of influence or intimidation by the executive branch of the State including operatives of its agencies as noted in the IHC judges letter through other means.
The petition has also questioned whether Article 209 of the Constitution enables of SJC to take cognizance of the letter and initiate inquiry in respect of the instances of interference in the judicial work at the high court as well as the courts under its supervisory jurisdiction and to provide guidance to judges of the high court as well as the courts under its supervisory jurisdiction in respect of the matters specified therein.
The petition said the constitution permits intra judicature consultation ie consultation among judges of the Supreme Court as well as judges of the high court along with judges of the courts under supervision of the high court for purposes of developing a robust code of conduct of judges of all tiers of the courts in Pakistan.

As a result, over 100 complaints are pending in the tribunal, majority of which are filed by students against medical and dental colleges.
It may be noted here that the Medical Tribunal Act 2020 has no provision for appointing a temporary or acting chairman.
When contacted, Secretary Health Nadeem Mehbub said he joined the department a few days ago and will inquire about the matter.
A senior official of the health ministry, wishing not to be quoted, said the medical tribunal remains dysfunctional since January 3 when the tenure of retired Justice Qalandar Ali Khan completed.
The former judge of Peshawar High Court was the first chairman of the medical tribunal under the Medical Tribunal Act 2020. He was appointed for a period of three years by the prime minister in consultation with the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP).
“Unfortunately, Medical Tribunal Act 2020 does not allow acting chairman or even letting the chairman continue working till the appointment of a new chairman. The ministry tried and even appointed Lahore High Court’s former judge Justice Shoaib Saeed as the acting chairman for three months but he did not assume the charge,” the official said.
Later, he added, an attempt was made to appoint retired Justice Ghulam Azam Qambrani as an acting chairman but he also refused because the appointment could be in violation of the Act.
“Currently, over 100 complaints are pending in the tribunal, majority of them are filed by students who got admissions in medical and dental colleges and even paid fees but after completion of a year were told that they cannot appear in exams as their colleges were not affiliated with universities, or have other issues,” he said.
When asked about the process of appointment, he said first of all the CJP was requested to nominate someone as the chairman. Once the CJP nominates the person, the name is forwarded to the Ministry of Law and finally moved to the prime minister for the issuance of a notification,” he said.

He was speaking at the launch of the country’s first think-tank on Africa - Pakistan-Africa Institute for Development & Research (PAIDAR) - which has been founded by Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed. The think-tank was launched at a seminar hosted by the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) with the theme: “Reviving the Bandung spirit of Afro-Asian solidarity: Pakistan-Africa relations”.
PAIDAR’s launch coincided with the 69th anniversary of the Bandung conference of Asian and African nations held on April 18, 1955 in Indonesia in which Pakistan participated together with China as well as countries from Africa.
The senior foreign ministry official said the first phase of Engage Africa Policy was successfully implemented under which Pakistan opened five new missions in Africa taking Pakistan’s diplomatic presence in the continent to 20. Moreover, two existing missions were upgraded.
Five more missions were planned to be opened under the Phase–II of the policy, but financial constraints forced revision of the goals and now the plan is to add one mission every year, he added.
Additionally, MoUs for political consultations have been signed with 10 African countries, Mr Khan said, adding that previously there were such arrangements with only seven countries in the continent.
Ethiopia and Zimbabwe opened diplomatic missions in Pakistan over the past two years. Rwanda and Tanzania are, meanwhile, opening their missions here later this year.
Senator Mushahid said Africa was a pivotal player in the resurgence of the Global South with 54 members of the African Union.
Outlining the objectives of the new Africa specific think-tank, Senator Mushahid said it was established to restore Pakistan’s foreign policy priority orientation and involvement in Africa and for reviving Pakistan-Africa bond through people-to-people exchanges and business-to-business connectivity in such areas as education, environment and climate change, trade and investment, energy, promoting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, maritime affairs, sports, tourism and culture.
Director General ISSI Amb Sohail Mahmood said that deeper engagement with Africa remains a strategic imperative for Pakistan.
“Forging a strong and effective partnership for peace, progress and prosperity is an indispensable goal, which should be advanced through a clear vision, consistent policy, and a long-term strategy,” he said.
Dean of the Islamabad-based African Corps Amb Mohammed Karmoune identified science and technology, agriculture, industrial cooperation and the promotion of trade and investments as the potential areas of cooperation between Pakistan and African 0countries
Ethiopian envoy Jemal Beker said Pakistan government’s ‘Look Africa’ and ‘Engage Africa’ policies led to the establishment of Ethiopia’s Mission in Islamabad as well as the commencement of Ethiopian airline direct flights to Pakistan.
Kenyan High Commissioner Mary Nyambura Kamau urged Pakistan to focus on enhancing economic cooperation through trade, investment, joint ventures, tourism, and technology exchange. This, she suggested, could be done both through regional blocks and bilateral levels.
