0,Aurangzeb banks on strong economic indicators for stable rupee,"Finance minister meets US, IMF, and World Bank officials in Washington","Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb held wide-ranging talks with key officials of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank as well as senior US administration officials in Washington and discussed with them the government’s ongoing economic reforms and other matters.
According to a finance ministry spokesperson, Aurangzeb, who is in Washington on the occasion of the IMF-World Bank spring meetings, met with US Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Horst at World Bank headquarters.
Besides, according to the spokesperson, Aurangzeb spoke at a roundtable meeting with teams of Bloomberg and the Pakistan Staff Association of World Bank and IMF and addressed the JP Morgan Seminar on Pakistan’s Economic Policy Outlook.
In his interaction with the State Department officials, Aurangzeb briefed them on Pakistan’s reform agenda with a focus on broadening the tax base, streamlining the energy sector, and fast-tracking the privatization process of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
He also highlighted emerging opportunities for US investment in Pakistan’s information technology, energy, agriculture, and minerals sectors. He told the US side that Pakistan would work closely with the International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) and the Exim Bank.
The meeting underscored the political will in Washington to strengthen the bilateral ties with Pakistan. Both sides resolved to upgrade their economic partnerships in alternate energy, agriculture, climate resilience, and tech industry sectors.
Earlier, Finance Minister Aurangzeb met with the Pakistan Staff Association of World Bank and IMF team and apprised it of the government’s reform agenda. Broadening of the tax base, reforms in the energy sector, privatization, digitization, and public-private partnership were also discussed during the meeting.
At the round table meeting with Bloomberg officials, the minister stressed that Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves were strong and the exchange rate had been stable; therefore, the value of the rupee was unlikely to fall further.
He said that remittances into Pakistan and the exports from the country were increasing. “Therefore, there is no justification for the traditional 6-8% annual depreciation of the rupee,” the minister was quoted as saying at the roundtable. He hoped to achieve a 4% growth rate in the coming years.
And addressing the JP Morgan ‘Seminar on Pakistan’s Economic Policy Outlook’, the minister highlighted that the inflationary pressure had decreased and the exchange rate was stable while the trade deficit was decreasing.
“The government is committed to the reform program for sustainable economic development and growth in the country,” the minister stated, outlining the three key reform areas of taxation, energy, and privatization. “Key indicators, including remittances, are showing better performance.”
Meanwhile, the finance minister also met with United Arab Emirates (UAE) Minister of State for Financial Affairs Mohamed bin Hadi Al Hussaini and discussed with him the bilateral economic cooperation and avenues for strengthening ties.
Highlighting the long-standing relations between Pakistan and the UAE, the minister expressed gratitude to the UAE’s financial support to Pakistan in times of need. He also expressed Pakistan’s interest in re-engaging with Middle Eastern banks to revive their interest in investment opportunities in Pakistan.
“The government is committed to continuing with reforms initiated under the current IMF program in the priority areas of taxation, energy, and privatization of SOEs,” Finance Minister Aurangzeb told his UAE counterpart.
During his meeting with the Executive Vice President of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and World Bank Group member Hiroshi Matano, the finance minister dilated Pakistan’s investment landscape and measures to enhance investor confidence.
The finance minister appreciated MIGA’s continued support in attracting foreign direct investment into Pakistan. He reiterated Pakistan’s focus on promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth, emphasizing the crucial role of the FDI in achieving this objective.
Matano commended Pakistan’s efforts for enhancing investors’ confidence and expressed MIGA’s readiness to continue supporting Islamabad in attracting quality foreign investments across various sectors of the economy.
He also met Deutsche Bank officials and discussed with them the establishment of a sustainable finance framework for the issuance of green sustainability bonds. The bank representatives briefed the minister on different transaction structures to assist Pakistan in accessing the international capital markets.

1,SHC orders foolproof security for Imran,CJ Abbasi emphasizes court's adherence to legal principles,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Thursday issued a directive instructing the federal government to ensure comprehensive security measures for the PTI founder at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.
The court emphasized its impartial stance, asserting that it adjudicates matters strictly in accordance with the law, irrespective of the individual involved, whether it be Imran Khan or PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif.
A division bench of the SHC, presided over by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi and Justice Mobeen Lakho, deliberated on an application seeking heightened security for the PTI founder.
Deputy Attorney General (DAG) Khaleeq Ahmed while filing comments on behalf of the federal government adopted the stance that the Centre had issued directives to the Punjab government to increase the security at Adiala Jail and provide foolproof security to Imran Khan.
He said the federal government had not only issued the orders but was also monitoring the entire situation.
He added that the PTI’s plea did not fall within the ambit of SHC and that the applicant should approach the Lahore High Court (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench.
Applicant Wahab Baloch’s counsel Ghuma Mohiyuddin Advocate argued that sensitive state institutions had expressed their concern about the security at Adiala Jail, adding that terrorists along with weapons were also apprehended outside the prison.
He stated that the federation bore the responsibility of guaranteeing the security of PTI founder.
He further noted that the federal government in its reply had backed PTI’s stance and admitted that Imran Khan’s life was in danger in the prison.
Addressing the DAG, the SHC chief justice remarked that the security of Imran Khan was the federal government’s “major responsibility” as he was in prison and “could not flee anywhere”.
He said the federal government “could not get rid of the matter”, noting that the Centre would look into it if there was a threat from outside.
He said the court had sought a reply from the federal government keeping in view the sensitivity of the matter.
The SHC chief justice directed the DAG that the federal government should constantly monitor the jail security and if necessary, the authorities concerned should increase the security inside and outside the prison.
Addressing the applicant, the chief justice remarked that their legal team should approach the relevant forum for filing the plea. He further noted that SHC was not the appropriate platform, but the court had summoned a reply from the government keeping in view the sensitivity of the matter.
The chief justice said the federal government was fulfilling its responsibility, adding that if the applicant had further apprehensions, they could approach the LHC or the Rawalpindi Bench.
The PTI lawyers requested the chief justice to pass an order to provide foolproof security to the PTI founder.
The chief justice replied that the court had to see matters according to law and was not concerned whether it was Imran Khan or Nawaz Sharif.
The SHC while making the federal government’s reply part of the court record ordered the federal government to provide foolproof security to the PTI founder and disposed of the plea.

2,Working with govt to 'understand concerns': X,Social media giant makes first comments since its Pakistan ban in Feb,"Social media platform X has said it would work with the Pakistani government “to understand their concerns” after authorities insisted an ongoing two-month ban on the micro-blogging network was based on security grounds.
The statement was made by X’s Global Government Affairs on late Wednesday night.
The platform, formerly known as Twitter, has been rarely accessible since February 17, when jailed former premier Imran Khan's party called for protests following ex-Rawal¬pindi commissioner Liaquat Chattha allegation that the chief election commissioner and chief justice of Pakistan were involved in rigging the general elections conducted earlier that month.
""We continue to work with the Pakistani Government to understand their concerns,"" X's Global Government Affairs team posted -- their first comments since the site was disrupted.
On Wednesday, the interior ministry in a report submitted to the Islamabad High Court wrote that X was blocked in the country on security grounds.
The report read that on the intelligence agencies’ request, the interior ministry issued orders for the closure of X on February 17, 2024, aimed at safeguarding national security as well as maintaining the law and order situation.
“Social media platforms are being used indiscriminately to spread extremist ideas and false information. X is being used as a tool by some nefarious elements to undermine law and order and promote instability,” it added.
In a related development, the Sindh High Court ordered the interior ministry to either justify the shutdown of X or rescind its February 17 letter directing the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to ban the network.
The prolonged disruption of X raised widespread concerns about democratic freedoms in the country.
A total of 28 civil society organizations, including Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, issued a joint statement of condemnation.

3,Pakistan seeks to heal ties with India,Dar initiates in-house talks on trade with neighbor,"Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Thursday he started consultations with stakeholders on the resumption of trade ties with India in yet another sign of the government’s eagerness to seek rapprochement with the neighboring country.
Dar told reporters at the Foreign Office that he had already begun discussions with the business community to build consensus on the thorny issue. Once consensus was built among the business community, he added, he would then start a consultation process with other stakeholders.
Any decision on the reopening of the trade would be taken after the input from all the relevant stakeholders, he said.
Dar first hinted at the possibility of resumption of trade ties with India last month during a press conference in London. He was of the view that the business community in Pakistan wanted the resumption of trade ties between Pakistan and India.
His statement drew criticism from opposition ranks and critics, who termed it ill-timed. However, Dar on Thursday defended his earlier remarks, stating that many businessmen told him that they were importing goods from India through a third country, which cost them more, and hence they were in favor of the resumption of direct trade ties between the two countries.
Islamabad severed trade ties with New Delhi in the aftermath of India’s decision to revoke the special status of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region in August 2019. Since then, Pakistan has consistently maintained that normalization would happen only after Delhi reverted to the pre-August 5, 2019 status quo.
There were efforts, however, in the past to partially reopen trade, first during the time of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government and second time when the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) was in charge.
In March 2021, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet gave a go-ahead to partially reopen trade with India. Then Prime Minister Imran Khan, who held the additional charge of the commerce minister, approved the ECC decision. However, the proposal was shot down by the prime minister at the federal cabinet after some members termed the move as political suicide.
The resumption of trade was part of behind-the-scene efforts by the two sides to normalize their relationship. The secret diplomacy earlier led to the renewal of the 2003 ceasefire deal along the Line of Control (LoC).
There was another push to reopen trade with India after the PTI government was replaced by the coalition government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Then Finance Minister Dr Miftah Ismail got the go-ahead from the prime minister to import tomatoes and onions from India to tackle the rising inflation.
Miftah told The Review show on Express News recently that in one of the international conferences he bumped into the Indian foreign minister. During that brief conversation, he expressed Pakistan’s intention to reopen trade with India. Miftah said the Indian foreign minister had told him that he would speak to the government. “However, he would never get back to me,” Miftah added.
Observers believe that the hard-line government of India may not be keen to restore trade links with Pakistan. They are also of the view that any progress on trade or other ties would happen after the Indian general elections. India is scheduled to go for national elections in 7 phases over the next two months. The new government would take charge in June.
Dar’s statement on the possibility of resumption of trade with India indicated the longstanding view of three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who always pushed for friendly ties with the neighboring country.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Dar confirmed to the reporters that his Afghan counterpart invited him to visit Kabul. The invitation was extended last month when Afghan Interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi telephoned him after he was appointed foreign minister.
Dar insisted that engagement was the way forward to resolve any issues. He said he would travel to Kabul provided the prime minister and other stakeholders gave the go-ahead.
Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have been tense for months over the unresolved issue of banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The continued cross-border terrorist attacks have pushed Pakistan to limit its engagement with the Kabul regime.
Islamabad has taken a series of measures including repatriation of undocumented Afghans, plugging loopholes in the Afghan transit facility, and other measures to put pressure on the Taliban government. However, those efforts made little impact as terrorist groups continued to target from across the border ambassador US Ambassador Donald Blome held a meeting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday to delve into recent developments in the region.
Acting spokesperson for the US Mission, Thomas Montgomery, conveyed the essence of the dialogue in a statement issued shortly after the meeting without specifically mentioning the recent regional events.
Ambassador Blome reiterated the United States' unwavering commitment to collaborating closely with the government and the people of Pakistan. He underscored that ensuring prosperity and security for Pakistan remains among the highest priorities for the United States.

4,Japanese targeted in Karachi suicide attack,Five foreigners escape unhurt; security guard martyred in shooting,"Five Japanese nationals miraculously remained unhurt in a suicide attack on their Hiace van in Karachi’s Landhi neighbourhood but their private security guard succumbed to his injuries.
The suicide bomber was killed in the attack carried out near Landhi’s Mansehra Colony bus stop and his accomplice shot dead by the Sharafi Goth police as well as the security guards in the van in retaliatory exchange of fire. Another security guard and a bystander -- a fire brigade employee -- suffered injuries because of the other terrorist’s firing.
The suicide bomber has been identified as Sohail Khan, aged around 30 and a resident of Panjgur. The other attacker was aged around 35.
The security guard who lost his life in the attack was identified as 45-year-old Noor Mohammad. Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said he had suffered a bullet wound to the head.
On receiving the information about the attack, the Sharafi Goth police stationed at a nearby filling station reached the scene.
The police said the Japanese nationals were shifted to a safe place.
Three rifles, six grenades, petrol bottles, a big water bottle, and a launcher were found in a bag in the possession of the gunned down terrorist.
The bomb disposal squad defused everything after retrieval, after which they were handed over to the Sharafi Goth police.
The news of the suicide attack on the vehicle of the Japanese nationals spread like wildfire in the city.
Police, Rangers, officers of intelligence agencies and bomb disposal unit reached the scene and sealed it off. The two injured men were rushed to the Jinnah Hospital for medical assistance. The police surgeon said one of them was in a serious condition.
Speaking to the media at the crime scene, Deputy Inspector General East Azfar Mahesar said one of the attackers was wearing a suicide vest.
He added that the second terrorist was killed by police firing.
“The police provide security to foreigners working on CPEC [China-Pakistan Economic Corridor] and other projects and the security guards have also shown great courage in this act of terrorism.”
The police official told the media that the suicide bomber had reached the crime scene on foot.
“We are investigating who were the handlers of the suicide bomber and how he was brought here.”
 Karachi acting police chief Imran Yaqoob Minhas, who was there as well, told the media that the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) was collecting evidence and looking into the matter.
“It is too early to say anything at this time but the terrorists’ ambitions have been dashed.”
CTD in-charge Raja Umar Khattab said the Japanese nationals were travelling in a convoy of three vehicles.
He added that the accomplice panicked when he saw that the suicide bomber had failed to achieve the objective and started firing.
The suicide bomber’s last call from his cell phone was to tell his accomplices that he was present on Korangi Road.
After receiving orders from his handlers, he chased the van of the Japanese nationals. As soon as their van slowed down on a speed breaker in Mansehra Colony, he blew himself up.
The CCTV footage of the incident has also surfaced in which it could be seen clearly that the bomber attacked after the chase.
Police sources said the dead terrorists had other accomplices, who escaped from the scene and search was under way to arrest them.
 
A police officer told The Express Tribune on the condition of anonymity that the terrorists were aware of the route of foreigners to an export processing zone, where they worked as engineers, from their residence in Clifton’s Zamzama area.
In Tokyo, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, told a news conference that one Japanese national was confirmed to have been injured and the government was checking details, having flagged the risk to other citizens in Pakistan.
In statement issued by the PM’s Office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the terrorist attack in Karachi and said timely action by the police prevented any major loss of life.
Praying for the recovery of the injured, the premier pledged not to rest until terrorism had been completely eradicated from the country.
President Asif Ali Zardari also commended the police’s timely action against the terrorists. In a statement, he said that timely action by police prevented major casualties.

5,IMF clubs Pakistan with war-torn countries,"The economic forecast for Pakistan revises to 2% growth in 2024, with inflation remaining a concern.","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has clubbed Pakistan among six nations facing serious conflicts this year and said that conflicts and tight macroeconomic policy conditions would have a toll on their economic outputs.
Separately, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva in Washington on Wednesday. The minister showed Pakistan’s interest in seeking another long-term bailout package. The finance ministry has remained tight-lipped about the meeting.
However, IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia Director Jihad Azour later told reporters that the Fund was ready to support Pakistan and stressed that the package of reforms was now more important than the size of the new program.
""I think what is important at this stage is to accelerate the reforms, double down on the structure of reforms in order to provide Pakistan with its full potential of growth,"" Azour told a press conference on the sidelines of the IMF 2024 spring meetings.
Earlier on Thursday, in its report on the Middle East and Central Asia region, the IMF said that the economic forecast for 2024 had been revised down to 2.6% for the region as conflicts, tight policy settings in some economies, and lower hydrocarbon production continued to weigh on growth.
“Beyond West Bank and Gaza, six economies in MENA [Middle East and North Africa] and Pakistan faced conflicts at the beginning of 2024. These are Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen,” read a footnote to the report, released on the sidelines of the World Bank-IMF spring meetings.
Bracketing Pakistan with countries that are facing serious conflicts, including civil wars, may not bode well for the country’s global image and could contribute to hampering investment. This shows the poor handling of the IMF affairs by the finance ministry.
The IMF stated in the report that a country was considered to be in a conflict if at least 25 battle-related fatalities were recorded by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project between January 1, 2024, and March 8, 2024.
There has been an increase in the number of terrorist attacks on the civil and armed forces of the country, including a fatal attack on the Chinese nations, which resulted in the deaths of five Chinese citizens last month.
The report stated that the conflict in Gaza and Israel had worsened an already challenging environment, and disruptions to shipping through the Red Sea had added to uncertainty. However, it added that economic growth was projected to strengthen as the impact of oil production cuts and conflicts gradually faded while remaining below historical averages over the medium term.
The report underlined that the economic growth outlook for the region and Pakistan was characterized by an uneven recovery against a backdrop of armed conflicts, hydrocarbon dependence, and persistent structural challenges.
It said that after contracting in 2023, growth in Pakistan was projected to rebound to 2% in 2024, supported by continuing positive base effects in the agriculture and textile sectors.
Pakistan’s population growth rate was 2.6% and a low growth rate of 2% meant more unemployment and poverty in the country that had been hit the hardest by the continued wave of inflation.
Despite tight economic conditions, the IMF again advised Pakistan to keep its monetary policy strict –a policy that had already taken a heavy toll on the industrial output and the government’s budget.
“Where inflationary pressures persist, monetary policy should remain tight and follow a data-dependent approach like in Egypt, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, while closely monitoring risks of a reversal of inflation developments.”
Pakistan’s inflation rate slowed down to 20.7% in March, which the analysts said, had created the room for a cut in the interest rates. However, the IMF still advised a precautionary path. “If inflation moderates faster than expected, countries should carefully monitor developments and stand ready to ease monetary policy sooner if conditions allow,” said the global lender.
In its World Economic Outlook report, the IMF adjusted Pakistan’s inflation forecast upward to 24.8% for this fiscal year and 12.7% for the next fiscal year. Contrary to the government’s drumming of achieving external sector stability, the IMF said that Pakistan’s external sector buffers had deteriorated.
“Pakistan’s external buffers deteriorated, mostly reflecting ongoing debt service, including Eurobond repayments,” the IMF said. It added that the credit risk of many countries had narrowed over the past year and was close to early 2023 levels but “they remain at distressed levels [more than 1,000 basis points] for Lebanon, Pakistan, and Tunisia”.
The global lender said that the continued reliance on domestic financing risked further exacerbating the sovereign-bank nexus, given the already high exposure of banks to sovereign debt in Egypt and Pakistan.
The banks had on average invested about three-fourths of their balance sheets in the government debt, according to the World Bank report. There might be no let-up in the higher borrowing requirements, as the IMF had also projected 7.3% of the GDP budget deficit for the next fiscal year.
For the past four days, the rupee had again started shedding the value against the US dollar, albeit at a slow pace. In an interview with Bloomberg in Washington, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said there should be no reason for the rupee to depreciate more than the range of about 6% to 8% seen in a typical year.
However, what the finance minister described as a normal deprecation of 6% to 8% in a typical year means a devaluation of Rs17 to Rs23 per dollar in the value of the rupee. If one goes by the finance minister’s reading of the value, the rupee should be over Rs300 to a dollar in the next fiscal year.
