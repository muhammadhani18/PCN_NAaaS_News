• In address to joint sitting of parliament, president proposes meaningful dialogue, consensus to end political strife
• Opposition claims Zardari ‘not legitimate head of state’, vows to continue protests
ISLAMABAD: As Presi­dent Asif Ali Zardari attempted to make a case for political reconciliation in his address to a joint session of parliament on Thursday, PTI lawmakers responded to his overture with a full-throated ruckus, that continued throughout his speech.
President Zardari spoke for almost 20 minutes in his record seventh presidential address, with a portrait of his spouse ex-PM Benazir Bhutto placed by his side and his children Bilawal and Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari sitting in the front row.
The session was, however, skipped by the three service chiefs and two chief ministers — Maryam Nawaz and Ali Amin Gandapur. Even PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif was conspicuous by his absence.
During the speech, PTI members clamoured in front of the dais, shouting ‘Go Zardari Go’ throughout. At times, the president seemed to lose his train of thought, but remained composed and only acknowledged the protesters with a smile, ending his speech with a victory sign.
“In my considered view, it is time to turn a new page… The challenges we face are not impossible to overcome. They just require the fundamentals of meaningful dialogue and parliamentary consensus… We can effectively tackle our challenges and foster an atmosphere of mutual respect and political reconciliation,” he said.
President Zardari said the country needed to build its strengths by investing in people, focusing on public needs, and harnessing its resources to create pathways to inclusive growth.
Besides economic and tax reforms, he also urged the federal government to promote a working relationship with the provinces.
About climate change, the president said Pakistan had been devastated by the adverse impacts of climate change, especially the 2022 floods. “We urgently need to invest in climate-friendly and climate-resilient infrastructure to mitigate the rapidly compounding risks of risks of climate change.”
Regional peace
Referring to the surge in terrorism, which threatens national security as well as regional peace, he termed the problem a shared concern that required collective efforts for eradication. He urged the neighbouring countries to take “strong notice” of militant groups involved in attacks against Pakistan’s security forces and people.
President Zardari also thanked friendly countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, the UAE, China, Turkiye, and Qatar for supporting Pakistan through difficult times.
Speaking about the Kashmir issue, he called upon India to reverse all illegal measures taken on or after Aug 5, 2019. He also expressed deep concerns over the genocide of Palestinians by the Israeli forces in Gaza, saying Pakistan condemned the brutality and impunity of the occupation forces.
‘Tough time’
In a media talk outside the Parliament House, the PTI leaders boasted they gave a ‘tough time’ to President Zardari during his address. PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan justified the protest, saying the PTI would continue to pressure the government. “We gave him the 21-gun salute — the one they all deserve,” he quipped.
“The protest is for the restoration of democracy and strengthening of the parliament,” he claimed. “Zardari is not the legitimate president of the country, and the worst is that he is not even behaving in that manner.” He said Mr Zardari has not even resigned from the PPP co-chief position even though he was the head of the state and the symbol of the federation.
Barrister Khan said that the president of the country has to be “apolitical but Zardari sahib addressed the [PPP] public gathering” in Naudero. “Is that legal,” he questioned.

QUETTA: Seven more people have been killed in accidents in Balochistan as heavy rains continue to inflict damages across the province.
So far, 17 people have died and 15 injured due to roof collapses, lightning strikes and other mishaps since heavy rain and thunderstorms started last week.
Separately, eight people were killed in two accidents as rainfall continued in several areas of Azad Kashmir.
The seven new deaths in Balochistan were reported from the border town of Chaman on Thursday.
According to Chaman Deputy Commissioner Athar Abbas Raja, the victims, including four women and two children, were travelling in a car which was swept away by a flash flood.

Family washed away in Balochistan border town; dozens stranded by urban flooding

A large number of mud houses have also been swept away by flash floods triggered by heavy rainfall on surrounding mountains, Mr Abbas told Dawn over the phone.
He said gushing water has also badly damaged roads, cutting Chaman off from other areas of Balochistan and suspending transit trade with Afghanistan.
A railway track was also affected, suspending the train service between Quetta and Chaman. Damage to another track at the Spintangi area in the Sibi-Harnai section has also suspended rail service between Sibi and Harnai.
The northeastern district of Harnai, which has been receiving heavy rain with thunderstorms for the last many days, has been cut off from Quetta and other areas as link roads were washed away by flash floods.
The link of Makran division with Karachi was also cut off after a bridge on the coastal highway between Ormara and Basool collapsed.
A small dam in Chaman burst as it received excessive rainwater during a downpour which started early Thursday morning and lasted for several hours.
Officials said that Pado Dam on the outskirts of border town was washed away, causing massive destruction in old and new Chaman.
The water entered human settlements and damaged houses, forcing the residents to flee to take refuge at safer places.
Flash floods also swept away eight cars parked in a showroom at Chaman Bypass, a senior official of Levies force said.
He added that life had been virtually suspended in Chaman as all roads were inundated due to urban flooding.
Roghani Road, Killi Roozudin, Killi Salehzai and other areas were badly affected with dozens of houses damaged.
Officials said personnel of Frontier Corps, Levies and local administration had launched rescue operations in the affected areas and were shifting stranded families.
Similar destruction of houses and roads was also reported in other areas as heavy rains continued in Ormara, Pasni, Jewani, Ziarat, Loralai, Musa­khail, Barkhan, Dera Bugti, Kohlu, Sibi, Bolan, Noshki, Dalbandin, Washuk, Panjgur and areas bordering Iran and Afghanistan.
Eight killed in accidents
At least seven people were killed and 14 injured when a careened off a slippery road near Moiyan Khakheyan in AJK during heavy rain on Thursday, police and rescuers said.
The coach was travelling to the mountainous Kai Manja village from Garhi Dupatta when it met with the accident around 6pm, some nine kilometres away from its last destination, according to Muzaffarabad SSP Yaseen Baig.
The vehicle was overloaded when it veered off the narrow and slippery road amid downpour, the SSP said, adding that the vehicle fell hundreds of feet down into a ravine.
Four of the passengers died on the spot, while the rest were critically injured and moved to a hospital.
Two more victims succumbed to their wounds during the treatment, SSP Baig said, adding that two of the injured were still in critical condition.
One of the victims was living in a shack which the bus hit while plunging down, a rescuer told Dawn.
He said tiny hut was completely destroyed, leaving one of its occupants dead and others injured.
In a separate accident, a landslide along the Muzaffarabad-Mansehra road claimed one life on Thursday, triggering protest from drivers and locals for the construction of a tunnel.
Saddar Police SHO Manzar Chughtai told Dawn that a mini-truck, loaded with vegetables, fell off the road after being caught in the landslide at around 1:30am.
The truck driver, Mohammad Raqeeb, 32, died on the spot.

A civilian and a minor girl were also killed in the attack, which took place within the remits of Daraban police station on Wednesday, according to local police.
The official statement issued by Customs said its officers from the Dir­ec­torate of Intelligence and Investigation (Pesha­war) were conducting an IBO when they were ambushed by unknown assailants at Daraban Road near the Sagguu village.
“All five officials embraced martyrdom,” the statement read.

3,"US, Pakistan discuss ‘recent events in region’","Blome says Pakistan’s prosperity remains top priority; meeting comes ahead of Raisi’s visit, expected on Monday.","• Blome says Pakistan’s prosperity remains top priority
• Meeting comes ahead of Raisi’s visit, expected on Monday
• At UN, Islamabad refrains from denouncing Iran’s retaliatory strikes against Israel
ISLAMABAD / WASHINGTON: The United States on Thursday reached out to Pakistan regarding escalating conflict between Teh­ran and Tel Aviv, even as Islam­abad stayed away from condemning the Iranian attack on Israel.
“US Ambassador Donald Blome met today with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to discuss recent events in the region,” the US Embassy said in a statement.
FM Dar said he discussed “various aspects of Pakistan-US relations and recent global and regional developments” with Amb Blome without clearly saying what message the envoy had conveyed.
This was the first time that the US has publicly contacted Islam­abad on the issue, since Israel hit the Iranian consulate in Damascus, killing a number of its senior commanders deployed there, and the subsequent Iranian retaliatory drone and missile strikes against Israel.
The meeting, moreover, comes ahead of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi’s upcoming three-day visit to Islamabad, due to start from Monday.
Interestingly, while Amb Blome was meeting with FM Dar, Iranian envoy Reza Amiri-Moghaddam was also at the Foreign Office to discuss the details of President Raisi’s upcoming visit.
The US has signalled its desire to prevent further escalation in the current situation. Instead, it aims to concentrate its efforts on China and Ukraine. The ongoing crisis in the Middle East is diverting its focus, energy, time, and resources.
A Pakistani diplomat claimed that the US has not asked Islamabad anything regarding the conflict, but it is concerned about reports that Pakistan plans to go ahead with the stalled gas pipeline project with Iran. Therefore, Washington will be watching the Iranian president’s visit with great interest.
“Amb Blome conveyed the United States’ commitment to working with the government and people of Pakistan, underscoring that prosperity and security for Pakistan remains a top priority for the United States,” the US embassy said in its statement.
Amb Blome’s meeting adds an interesting layer, especially considering Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s ongoing discussions with the IMF in Washington on a potential follow-up programme to the previous $3 billion stand-by arrangement. The new IMF programme is believed to be crucial for the financially struggling country.
UN move
In a related development, Pakistan refrained from joining a UN move to condemn Iran’s attacks on Israel, signalling its desire to remain neutral on the issue.
On Wednesday, the United States and 47 other countries circulated a statement unequivocally condemning attacks on Israel by Iran “and its militant partners”.
During the weekend, Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles, although most were intercepted with the help of the United States, Britain, France, and Jordan.
The statement initiated by the US permanent mission to the UN urged nations across the globe to condemn the Iranian action. Britain, France, Germany, and 47 states supported the US move.
A statement distributed by Pakistan’s permanent mission on Thursday expressed deep concern over the ongoing developments in the Middle East.
It pointed out that for months, Pakistan has emphasised the necessity of international efforts to prevent the expansion of hostilities in the region and to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza.
On April 2, Pakistan condemned an Israeli attack on an Iranian consular office in Syria as “a major escalation in an already volatile region”.
The statement highlighted that latest developments in the Middle East were the consequences of diplomatic breakdown. “These also underscore the grave implications when the UN Security Council is unable to fulfil its responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security,” Pakistan warned.
Pakistan reminded the international community that it’s “critically urgent to stabilise the situation and restore peace” and urged “all parties to exercise utmost restraint and move towards de-escalation”.
The United States and its allies also condemned Iran’s seizure of a Portuguese-flagged commercial ship near the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday and called for the immediate release of the ship and its crew.

4,Government eyes deregulation of fuel prices,"Hastens process amid rise in smuggling, complaints from oil industry.","• Hastens process amid rise in smuggling, complaints from oil industry
• Move may help shift brunt of public criticism to oil marketing companies
ISLAMABAD: Amid increasing fuel prices and the oil industry’s complaints over the rising influx of smuggled oil products, the government has expedited the process of deregulating petroleum pro­duct prices to shift the brunt of public cri­ticism to oil marketing companies (OMCs).
In a directive, the petroleum division has asked the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) “to share a presentation on the analysis and implications of deregulation of petroleum products” within three days.
This should particularly cover the “in-country freight equalisation margins (IFEM) and other related aspects”, it said.
The directive came following instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office for urgent finalisation of a “deregulation framework for the petroleum sector”, a senior government official said.
The government has been under public criticism for rising petroleum product prices, even though it was not at liberty to change fixed tax rates on various products under the donor-dictated pricing mechanism.
The government’s only role at present is limited to announcing fortnightly fuel prices calculated by Ogra to pass on the impact of the international market and exchange rate to consumers.
The oil industry has also been criticising the government for doing little to stop the massive smuggling of low-quality and cheaper products, particularly from Iran.
This smuggling affects the regulated oil industry’s market share and profitability, and cau­ses the government annual revenue loss of over Rs230 billion.
The industry had warned the government of its inability to upgrade its infrastructure to Euro-5 quality fuels when it had to compete with low-quality kerosene and benzene-grade smuggled fuels freely available across the country.
Pricing independence
An official told Dawn that while the final deregulation framework would come out with the approval of the federal cabinet and the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), the deregulation of petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) pricing would mean an end of uniform pricing across the country and the oil companies would be free to set their own prices for different cities and towns.
Legally speaking, he explained, petroleum prices were already deregulated and the government notified only kerosene prices for the retail stage.
In case of other products like petrol, HSD and light diesel oil, the government only notified tax rates like petroleum development levy, customs duty and sales tax, etc. and fixed profit margins for dealers and marketing companies, while Ogra and the Ministry of Finance adjust the IFEM, which currently ensures uniform pricing across Pakistan.
Therefore, the Ministry of Finance normally announces ex-depot prices without notification, while petrol stations set their own retail prices.
On the other hand, the oil industry set its own rates for furnace oil and the high-octane blending component (HOBC) based on tax rates notified by the government.
Now, the government is likely to completely deregulate the prices of petrol and diesel, including commissions of OMCs and dealers, on the pattern of HOBC.
In the new framework, Ogra and the Competition Commission of Pakistan would have a greater role, notwithstanding their limited capacity and outreach, to ensure product quality, availability and competitive environment to avoid market collusion and cartelisation.
This would also mean that the IFEM mechanism would also be deregulated. This means the prices would significantly vary from one city to another and from one oil company to another.
Consumers close to ports and refineries would be at an advantage in getting products at cheaper rates, while those further afield would have to pay a higher price. The difference could vary between Rs3 and Rs8 per litre, depending on the actual transportation cost.
Warning from OCAC
The move comes at a time when the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) — an association of over three dozen oil companies and refineries — warned the government early this week about “a serious threat to the opportunity of huge investment in the country due to the staggering influx of smuggled petroleum products from Iran”.
In a letter to the SIFC, the advisory council said that besides causing billions of rupees revenue loss to the government and forcing the local refineries to operate at unviable lower throughputs, the “menace of unabated smuggling seemingly under the patronage of official authorities is now reached to the extent that it may jeopardise opportunity of the forthcoming huge investment (worth $5bn-6bn) in refineries expansion and upgradation projects under the Oil Refining Policy for Upgradation of Brownfield Refineries, 2023” notified in February 2024.
It pointed out that the feasibilities of these upgrade projects were based on the optimum capacity utilisation of refineries.
“The smuggling of petroleum products, if continued, would seriously question the viability of these projects, forcing the prospective investors to review their decisions” to bring in huge investment and substantially increase production of deficit products and meet environment-friendly Euro-5 specifications.
