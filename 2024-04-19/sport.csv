At the time of his death, he was England’s oldest living men’s Test cricketer.
Subba Row played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and then joined the powerful Surrey side of the 1950s that won seven successive County Championships.
Unable to secure a permanent first-team place at The Oval, he moved to Northamptonshire, where he was appointed captain in 1958.
That year also saw Subba Row win the first of his 13 England caps and in 1961 he scored a century in both his first and last Tests against Australia. In all, he scored 984 Test runs at an average of over 46.
After retiring to pursue a business career, he was the manager of England’s tour of India and Sri Lanka in 1981.
Subba Row also served five years as chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board, the forerunner of the ECB, from 1985-90. He later became one of the International Cricket Council’s first match referees, overseeing 160 fixtures.
“We are extremely saddened to hear of Raman’s passing,” said ECB chair Richard Thompson.

The 55-year-old former batsman takes charge of the US men’s team ahead of a three-match home T20 series against Bangladesh next month.
The United States will host the World Cup with the West Indies in June. USA Cricket did not reveal the length of Law’s contract. 
“It is an exciting opportunity to join USA Cricket at this time,” said Law, who has previously coached Bangladesh, the West Indies and Afghanistan at international level. “USA is one of the strongest associate nations in the sport and I believe that we can mold a formidable squad going ahead. 
“The first task will be to prepare the team for the series against Bangladesh and then set our sights on our home World Cup, which will be huge.” Venu Pisike, chairman of USA Cricket, called the Australian “one of the most accomplished coaches in the sport.”  
“He brings a lot of experience to USA Cricket with his varied assignments, particularly in developing international sides over the years,” said Pisike. “His appointment will only help the team grow to their full potential.”

2,Rishabh Pant boosts his World Cup hopes with keeping masterclass,"After suffering serious injuries in a car accident in Dec 2022, the 26-year-old is Delhi's leading scorer with 210 runs from seven matches.","NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals captain Rishabh Pant produced a wicket-keeping masterclass in Wednesday’s Indian Premier League (IPL) victory against Gujarat Titans to strengthen his claim on a place in India’s T20 World Cup squad.
Pant is playing his first tournament since suffering serious injuries in a car accident in December 2022 that kept him out of last year’s IPL as well as the 50-overs World Cup in India.
The 26-year-old’s batting has not been rusty on his return though and he is Delhi’s leading scorer with 210 runs from seven matches, including two fifties, this season.
 
 

His glovework was equally impressive on Wednesday night as he took two catches, including a stunning grab to dismiss David Miller, and produced a couple of stumpings as Delhi bundled out Gujarat for 89.
Pant then made 16 not out as Delhi cruised to the target inside nine overs en route to their third win in seven matches.
Delhi bowling coach James Hopes said they sorely missed Pant’s neat keeping and explosive batting last season.
“Last year, we tried really hard to cover that gap,” he added.  “But it is very hard to cover a world-class wicket-keeper, if not the best wicket-keeper/batsman in the world, when he’s going on.
“Now that he is back, you can see everything about his game, his keeping, his captaincy …”
Former England captain Kevin Pietersen was also impressed by Pant’s agility behind the stumps, and tipped him to play at the T20 World Cup in June.
“His mobility tonight was something that will give him great encouragement, which will also encourage Team India,” Pietersen told Star Sports.
“Of course, he needs game time, as everyone does when coming back from an injury. He’s returning from a horrific injury, so game time is crucial for him.
“To prepare for the T20 World Cup, he should play these 1415 IPL games because it’s significant leading into a T20 World Cup.
“If he plays that much cricket, he will be ready.”

3,Ex-Australia skipper Meg Lanning says ‘obsession’ caused retirement,"Lanning skippered the women’s team for almost a decade, winning four T20 World Cups, a 50-over World Cup and Commonwealth Games gold.","SYDNEY: Former Australia cricket captain Meg Lanning said Thursday that an unhealthy “obsession” with food and exercise led to her sudden international retirement last year aged just 31.
Lanning skippered Australia’s all-conquering women’s team for almost a decade, winning four Twenty20 World Cups, a 50-over World Cup and Commonwealth Games gold.
But behind the star batter’s cool exterior she says that she was struggling.
A private person, Lanning told an Australian cricket podcast that to escape the pressures she began running up to 90 kilometres (56 miles) a week, but did not eat enough to fuel her “obsession”.
She said she lost significant weight, struggled to sleep, became moody and withdrew from people close to her. 
“I was over-exercising and under-fuelling,” said Lanning, who earned the nickname “Megastar” for her run-scoring exploits. “It sort of just spiralled and I was in denial, even though everyone kept telling me something wasn’t quite right. 
“I was not in a place to be able to go on tour and play cricket and give the commitment levels required for that Ashes series (in 2023) mentally and physically.” 
Lanning, who has continued playing in the Women’s Big Bash League and the WPL in India, declined to label the problem an eating disorder.
But she eventually sought help after it began affecting her life. 
“I am naturally fine spending time with myself but there were very few people who I would want to engage with. I would get really snappy, real moody, if anyone asked anything,” she said. “I disengaged a lot from friends and family. I didn’t realise that I was doing this. It sort of became a new normal.” 
With the demands of being captain and touring the world a thing of the past, Lanning said she was now “in a good spot”. 
“I’ve really started to understand how actually talking to people and letting people know can actually help,” she said.

4,Sharma ‘would love to’ play Tests against Pakistan at neutral venue,NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma says he wouldn’t mind playing Tests against Pakistan at a neutral venue as ...,"NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma says he wouldn’t mind playing Tests against Pakistan at a neutral venue as it would be a “great contest” against the “superb bowling line-up” of the arch-rivals, the Press Trust of India news agency reported on Thursday.
India and Pakistan have not played bilateral cricket ever since the latter’s tour across the border for a One-day International series in 2012. The two countries, however, routinely face off in International Cricket Council (ICC) events. 
“I totally believe that they are a good team, superb bowling line-up, good contest, if we play overseas,” Sharma said on Club Prairie Fire, a Youtube show hosted by former Australian keeper-batter Adam Gilchrist and former England skipper Michael Vaughan. “The last Test was played way back in 2007-08. 
“Yeah, I would love to, it would be a great contest between two sides. We play them in ICC trophies, pure cricket I am looking at, great contest, so why not?”, he said when asked whether Indo-Pak Tests were possible at a neutral venue like England or Australia.
Led by Shaheen Shah Afridi, Pakistan’s traditionally pace-reliant bowling line-up currently features exciting talents like Naseem Shah, who is only 21, and Aamer Jamal.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has maintained that any decision on bilateral cricket with Pakistan will hinge on approval from the Indian government, which has so far not permitted cricketing engagement with the arch-foes.
Pakistan, on the other hand, has been aggressively pushing for bilateral engagement with India, even taking it up at ICC forums at every available opportunity.
Last year, India refused to travel to Pakistan for the Asia Cup, which was eventually conducted in a hybrid model. All of India’s scheduled games in Pakistan were relocated to Sri Lanka.
The next year’s Champions Trophy will be another bone of contention between the two countries as the tournament is set to be held in Pakistan, which has declared that it won’t agree to any change of venue to accommodate India.
The ICC, on its part, has stated that it won’t force any member nation to disregard government advisory. 
“… ICC Board’s position remains that it doesn’t expect its members to go against any policy/instructions issued by its own government,” an ICC official had stated recently.

BARCELONA: Casper Ruud racked up a tour-leading 26th win of the season on Thursday by reaching the Barcelona Open quarter-finals.
The world number six from Norway eased past Jordan Thompson of Australia 6-1, 6-4 to move clear of Jannik Sinner for most wins in 2024.
Ruud, the runner-up to Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Monte Carlo Masters last weekend, raced into a 5-0 lead against Thompson.
He then clinched a break in the seventh game of the second set before moving onto victory in just 73 minutes.
Ruud will next face Matteo Arnaldi after the Italian world number 40 defeated Argentina’s Marco Trungelliti 6-3, 6-0.
Britain’s Cameron Norrie defeated Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-3 to make the last-eight and record his 200th tour-level win.
“It’s a big tournament with a lot of historic past champions, so I want to try and win this tournament,” said Norrie of the Spanish clay-court event.
On Wednesday, Spanish veteran Bautista Agut had won his 400th career match by seeing off Andrea Vavassori in the second round.
“I know that yesterday Roberto got 400, so I’m halfway to his. To get 400 wins is impressive and I’ll take that, a 200th win against a top player,” added Norrie.
The Briton next faces Argentine 13th seed Tomas Martin Etcheverry for a place in the semi-finals.

The US Open champion needed two hours 27 minutes to silence her second round opponent, ranked 134th in the world.
Gauff began brightly, rattling off the first three games, but from then on it was to become an error-strewn struggle.
She double-faulted 15 times, enabling Vickery to get 19 break points, of which she converted seven.
Gauff converted six with the most important one coming in the seventh game of the deciding set.
Trailing 0-2, Vickery fou­ght her way back to take a 4-2 lead, with Gauff then clinching the crucial game on her fourth break point.
“She gets a lot of balls back and I was just trying to be patient and also be aggressive. I think I got passive. She played well and I think I did a good job of staying in the match,” said Gauff.
Gauff will face the winner of the match between Zheng Qinwen and Marta Kostyuk in the quarter-finals.
Former US Open champion Emma Raducanu def­eated three-time Grand Slam winner and former world number one Angelique Kerber 6-2, 6-1 in her first-round match.
At the weekend Radu­c­anu led Britain past France and into the finals of the Billie Jean King Cup in November and she continued that clay court form in Germany.
Raducanu hit 26 winners to 11 unforced errors while two-time Stuttgart champion Kerber was undone by 29 unforced errors.
The British player will next face the Czech Republic’s Linda Noskova where a win would put her into her second Stuttgart quarter-final.
Ninth-ranked Ons Jabeur snapped a five-match losing streak by beating Russia’s Ekaterina Alexandrova 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1) in the second round.
“I have thought about withdrawing from this tou­r­nament so many times because I couldn’t take another loss,” said Jabeur. “It was very, very difficult.”
The victory over 16th-ranked Alexandrova was just Jabeur’s third win of 2024 and first since beating Raducanu in Abu Dhabi.
Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka, runner-up in the German city for the last three years, advanced when close fri­end Paula Badosa retired from their second round clash with a left thigh injury in the final set.
Sabalenka has taken the first set 7-6 (7-4) but dropped the second, 6-4.
The Belarusian was a break down at 3-1 in the decider before clawing her way back to 3-3 when her Spanish opponent retired.
Sabalenka will face either Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova or Anastasia Potapova in the quarter-finals.

7,Real Madrid dig deep for revenge in Manchester,"With the Los Blancos hopeful of tying up the signing of long-term target Kylian Mbappe, the weeks ahead promise to be exciting.","MANCHESTER: Off the pace in the Champions League and La Liga last season, Real Madrid have bounced back strongly to give themselves a strong shot at securing both.
Carlo Ancelotti’s side dug deep for long periods on Wednesday to keep reigning European champions Manchester City at bay and squeeze past them on penalties into the semi-finals of the Champions League. They also boast a commanding eight-point lead on Barcelona in La Liga ahead of the Clasico on Sunday.
With the Los Blancos hopeful of tying up the signing of long-term target Kylian Mbappe, the weeks ahead promise to be exciting.
Real’s resilience in Manchester as Pep Guardiola’s side dominated the 1-1 draw — that ended a pulsating two-legged quarter-final 4-4 on aggregate before the Spanish side triumphed 4-3 in a shootout — means they can extend their record 14 Champions League triumphs, with Bayern Munich beckoning in the semi-finals.
It was sweet revenge for Real, who were thrashed 4-0 at the Etihad Stadium in their exit from the Champions League at the semi-final stage last year.
Amid Barca’s euphoria at the end of last season as they conquered La Liga, Real surveyed their weaknesses and acted to overcome them.
They moved for Jude Bellingham, adding steel to a team which was dismantled by City last season. The England international has replaced striker Karim Benzema in the line-up and, although deployed in an attacking role by Ancelotti, gives Real more defensive balance when out of possession.
This season the story was different at the Etihad and Ancelotti was beaming with pride.
“I love it when a team gives their all and sacrifices everything in big games like this one. I believe that there was no other way to beat Manchester City here. I’m proud of what we did,” said Ancelotti, who paced nervously up and down the touchline during the shootout until defender Antonio Ruediger scored the winning kick.
“By the time the penalty shootout came, we were totally convinced we’d go through. You work, sacrifice and win however you can. We defended really, really well tonight. This was about survival. Madrid is a club based on always fighting to stay in situations where there seems to be no way out but we always find a way.”
In La Liga, Real are poised to wrest the title from their arch-rivals. They can virtually sew it up this weekend when second-placed Barca visit the Santiago Bernabeu.
“We’re delighted, but we’re very tired — now we have to celebrate because it’s a very important qualification,” continued Ancelotti. “From tomorrow we have to prepare well for Sunday’s game, the Clasico is crucial for the league.”
 

MUNICH: Bayern Munich’s Joshua Kimmich (R) heads to score past Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya during their quarter-final second leg at the Allianz Arena.—Reuters

After capturing their first treble — Champions League, FA Cup and Premier League titles — last season, City appeared on track to become the first team in history to claim the three titles in back-to-back years.
But despite completely dominating Real, firing 33 shots to Real’s eight and taking 18 corners to just one for the visitors, Guardiola’s men could not finish them off.
Kevin De Bruyne blasted home in the 76th minute to cancel out Rodrygo’s 12th-minute goal, but both the Belgian and City’s goal-scoring machine Erling Haaland squandered several scoring chances as the tie finished 1-1 on the night.
Victory looked in City’s hands when Luka Modric failed to convert Real’s opening spot kick. But goalkeeper Andriy Lunin denied Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic and Real’s Nacho and Rudiger sealed the win.
“Congratulations to Real Madrid, they defend so deep, with incredible solidarity,” Guardiola said. “We did everything. I have no regrets about what we’ve done. Defensively, offensively, we played exceptional in all departments, in everything, and unfortunately we couldn’t win, so that’s what it is.”
Real’s survival instincts are pulling them towards another Champions League title but Bayern stand in their way.
BAYERN ‘FIGHT AND GRIND’ TO DEFEAT ARSENAL
Unlike Real, Bayern will not win any domestic silverware this season after their 11-year-reign as Bundesliga champions was ended by Bayer Leverkusen but are still in the running for the biggest continental club trophy, which they have won six times before, after they beat Arsenal 1-0 at home on Wednesday.
Bayern’s narrow win, thanks to a 63rd-minute header from Joshua Kimmich, gave Bayern a 3-2 aggregate win after a 2-2 draw in London in the first leg.
The hosts worked hard for the win which was in stark contrast to the free-flowing draw at the Emirates and striker Harry Kane toasted his side’s willingness to “fight and grind”.
“It’s an unbelievable win — it’s been a tight season for us,” England captain Kane told TNT. “We had to fight and grind and today was that. We knew we could make the difference with our own fans. It was what we expected, a tough game, a tight game and we got a great goal from Josh to make the difference.”
The victory sent Kane’s side through to the semi-finals for the first time since 2020, when the club won a treble, and he looked forward to the meeting with England team-mate Bellingham’s Real, saying it was “why we moved abroad”.
Kane left boyhood club Tottenham Hotspur for Bayern in the same summer that Bellingham moved from Borussia Dortmund to the Spanish giants.
The England captain, who will play alongside Bellingham at this summer’s European championships in Germany, said he moved for occasions like this.
“These are the experiences that I think we both moved abroad for. To try and achieve it, to play in these big nights,” he said.
Kane said making it to this year’s Champions League final, to be held at Wembley, was both his and Bellingham’s dream.
“For both of us of course. It’ll be in our national stadium so there’s an extra motivation to try and go there and achieve it. But you know we still have two games ahead of us which are going to be really tough and we have to focus on that.”
Wednesday’s result means departing Bayern Munich coach Thomas Tuchel has become the first German to lead clubs from three different countries to at least the semi-finals of the competition after he won the title with Chelsea in 2021 and led Paris St Germain to the final in 2020.
Tuchel will leave a year early after a disappointing domestic run but can now leave on a high.
“We are very proud to have reached the semi-finals and we will now see in two weeks what will happen,” he said.
Tuchel’s Arsenal counterpart Mikel Arteta, meanwhile, urged his players to use the “pain” of the quarter-final exit to fuel their Premier League title bid.
Arsenal are still in the hunt for the league title, sitting second on 71 points, level with Liverpool and two behind leaders City.
“What we have to play for (in the Premier League) is still beautiful. We have six games to go and we are two points behind City,” said Arteta. “It’s a very difficult schedule for everybody. We have to go through the pain tonight, and tomorrow get up and come with the same attitude that we came with here.”

8,‘French Open the moment to give everything’,BARCELONA: Rafael Nadal said the upcoming French Open will be the moment to  “give everything and die” on the...,"BARCELONA: Rafael Nadal said the upcoming French Open will be the moment to  “give everything and die” on the court after his comeback from injury in Barcelona was curtailed by Alex de Minaur on Wednesday.
The 22-time Grand Slam title winner, back playing this week after three months on the sidelines, battled well but eventually crumbled 7-5, 6-1 against the world number 11 from Australia in the second round.
Nadal, 37, who missed virtually all of the 2023 season, is hoping to compete at the French Open in May where he is the record 14-time champion.
The Spaniard said the clash with De Minaur was not the moment he was saving himself for, instead targeting his Roland Garros return as the time to go for broke in what he expects will be the last year of his career.
“On a personal level, for what is to come, the 6-1 in the second set is what had to happen today,” said Nadal, who explained there were bigger challenges ahead.
“It wasn’t today that I had to give everything and die, I have to give myself the chance to do that in a few weeks, or at least try to,” Nadal told reporters.
“I will try to take a step further in Madrid, then another one in Rome and, in Paris... there is the moment to do it, whatever happens, there is no better place to.”
Nadal said the key to being able to triumph at Roland Garros was continuing to build in the weeks ahead.
“[I need to be] getting the weeks of experience, of matches, and feeling more comfortable with everything,” continued Nadal.
“Today I felt more comfortable than yesterday ... I have to be realistic, today I cannot have a game that goes for two and a half hours, or three.”

9,Al-Ain’s Rahimi bags hat-trick to end Al-Hilal’s record run,Soufiane Rahimi’s first half hat-trick put the Hernan Crespo-coached side from the UAE on the cusp of a spot in next month’s final.,"AL AIN: Al-Hilal’s record breaking run of 34 consecutive wins came to a shuddering halt on Wednesday as Jorge Jesus’ Saudi Pro League leaders were beaten 4-2 by hosts Al-Ain in the first leg of their Asian Champions League semi-final.
Soufiane Rahimi’s first half hat-trick put the Hernan Crespo-coached side from the United Arab Emirates on the cusp of a spot in next month’s final as the Riyadh-based outfit’s run came to an end.
Al-Hilal’s loss, the first time they have failed to win in all competitions since a 1-1 SPL draw with Damak on Sept 21, came after the game at Hazza bin Zayed Stadium had been delayed for 24 hours due to widespread flooding across the UAE.
“There is no such thing called over confidence,” Jesus said.  “In football, you can’t control what happens in the match.
“We are not used to conceding four goals and we should sit and analyse why this happened and correct it.”
Rahimi put his side in front with six minutes on the clock, stroking the ball into the bottom corner of Mohammed Al-Owais’ goal after Yahia Nader’s pass trundled through to the Moroccan forward inside the penalty area.
Rahimi doubled his side’s advantage 20 minutes later with a penalty after Al-Owais had upended the striker as he raced into the area to latch onto another Nader pass and the 27-year-old picked himself off the turf to score the spot-kick.
Al-Ain were given a second penalty after a lengthy VAR review following Ali Al-Bulayhi’s miss-timed tackle on Erik Jorgens, with referee Adham Makhadameh eventually confirming his original decision and Rahimi converted in the 38th minute.
Striker Malcom pulled one back from close range for Al-Hilal four minutes into the second half when Sergej Milinkovic-Savic drove into the home side’s penalty area to set the Brazilian up to score.
Another Al-Ain penalty in the 55th minute, this time scored by Paraguayan Kaku after Rahimi had been upended by Kalidou Koulibaly, restored Al-Ain’s three-goal cushion but Salem Al-Dawsari netted with 12 minutes left to give his side hope.
“Nothing is decided as we still have a match in Riyadh and everyone  should be ready for the next match,” said Al-Ain coach Crespo. “The most important thing in life and in football is to be competitive. We are very happy with the result.
“I am happy because the players made the fans happy, and I am proud of the performance.”
The winner of the tie will face either Ulsan Hyundai of South Korea or Japan’s Yokohama F Marinos next month in the two-legged final.
Ulsan hold a 1-0 lead ahead of next Wednesday’s second leg in Japan after Lee Dong-gyeong’s 19th minute strike earned Hong Myung-bo’s outfit a narrow win at home.
The first leg of the final will be held in east Asia on May 11 with the return clash on the western side of the confederation two weeks later.

The 29-year-old’s career has been plagued by injuries and he has not played for England in any format since March 2023 because of an elbow injury. He was also sidelined for much of 2021 and 2022 due to back and elbow injuries.
“Last year, I played from January to May, because I did go to the IPL as well. And then the year before that, I played maybe one or two games for Sussex, so I’ve had a whole year of nothing ...,” Archer told 4Cast’s ‘The Athlete’s Voice’ podcast on Wednesday.
“Hopefully, from June 1 I’ve had no breaks... no injuries, and just constantly playing.
“It’s been a while and honestly, I don’t know if I’ve got another stop-start year in me. That’s the truth, I don’t know if I’ve got another one.”
Earlier this month, Rob Key, managing director of the England men’s team, said the pace bowler could still play in the World Cup in the West Indies and US, which begins on June 1.
Archer said he was just hoping to get back to playing consistently, even if he does not make the cut for the World Cup squad.
“There’s still the T20 Blast, there’s still the Hundred,” Archer said.
“There’s still cricket that I haven’t got a chance to play in the last couple of years. As much as I want to play in the World Cup, if it doesn’t happen for whatever reason, at least I still know I could be somewhat active as well.”—

RAWALPINDI: There were two balls bowled, one of them a peach of a delivery by Shaheen Shah Afridi that hit the middle stump of Tim Robinson. And that was that.
The opening Twenty20 of the series between Pakistan and New Zealand was washed out due to rain here at the Pindi Stadium on Thursday, the game ending almost as soon as it began after after a nearly three-hour delay, and after it had been reduced to a five-over match.
The fans, who braved the incessant downpour, did get something to cheer about though; the moment coming when Shaheen showing a return to his former self by sending back Robinson with a ball that swung back late as the right-hander attempted to swat away Pakistan’s pace spearhead.
The rain had delayed the toss by 30 minutes, and after it eventually took place with New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell opting to bat first, the downpour returned just when Shaheen took his mark to bowl the first ball.
It kept pouring down for the next hour and a half and just at the cut-off time, the umpires decided that it would be a five-over affair. However, all that could ensue on the pitch was Shaheen’s moment of brilliance.
Earlier, Pakistan, with Babar Azam returning as captain, had awarded international caps to batters Usman Khan and Irfan Khan Niazi, while Mohammad Amir — who had rescinded his retirement last month — was also to play his first match for the side after nearly four years. 
The team selection suggested Pakistan were aiming to test their bench strength with the series being the start of their build-up to the T20 World Cup, which is set to be held in the United States and the West Indies in June.
According to the line-up, Babar was to open the batting with explosive sensation Saim Ayub, while the former’s long-time opening partner Mohammad Rizwan was pushed down to number three.
Usman’s inclusion meant experienced batter Fakhar Zaman was also left out. Imad Wasim, who had also called his retirement off along with Amir, also was not included.
Pakistan may have named wicket-keeper Azam Khan in the eleven, but the pinch-hitter was left out due to an injury.
According to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Azam experienced discomfort in his right knee and calf muscle while batting in the nets during a training session on the eve of the match.
The PCB said the right-hander promptly received medical attention and treatment. Azam, 25, is currently under the care of the medical team, and a decision regarding his participation in the upcoming T20 matches against New Zealand will be made pending the results of radiology reports, the board added.
The next two matches will be played at the same venue on Saturday and Sunday, before the series moves to Lahore for the last two games. The series will be followed by Pakistan’s tour to Ireland and England for T20Is, before the side travels to Dallas for their first World Cup game.

KARACHI: A blistering century by West Indies captain Hayley Matthews saw the visitors thrash Pakistan by 113 runs in the first One-day International here at the National Bank Stadium on Thursday to register a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.
Williams smashed an unbeaten 140 to lead the Caribbean side to a towering total of 269-8, which proved too much for the hosts, who were bundled out for a mere 156 runs, with the West Indies captain bagging three wickets as well.
The series is being played as part of the ICC Women’s Championship with Pakistan placed fifth in its standings, eyeing direct qualification to next year’s 50-over World Cup.
Williams, 26, hit 15 fours and a six in her 150-ball knock after West Indies had elected to bat first. It was her fifth career century and she brought up her hundred in 125 balls. She had earlier taken 57 balls to post fifty.
Hayley put on 102 runs for the second wicket with Shemaine Campbelle — who added 45 off 71 with the help of four boundaries — after experienced Pakistan spinner Sadia Iqbal had dismissed Rashada Williams in the third over of the innings. 
After the West Indies slipped from 103-1 to 138-4, Hayley added 40 runs for the fifth wicket with Chinelle Henry (run-a-ball 23).
Hayley’s brilliance, coupled with Pakistan’s lapses in the field, allowed the West Indies to collect 77 runs in the last 10 overs, including 49 runs off the last 30 balls  
In their turn at the wicket, Pakistan were left chasing the game from the very start when they plummeted to 65-4, which soon became 100-6 before they were eventually dismissed for 156, thanks to a 23-ball 25 by Tuba Hassan.
From the top order, only opener Muneeba Ali (22 off 33) and captain Nida Dar (19 off 27) offered some resistance against all the accurate West Indies bowlers. 
Apart from Matthews, Afy Fisher and Zaida James picked up two wickets apiece, conceding 14 and 19 runs, respectively.
“Our bowling was disappointing and the fielding was full of lapses,” rued Nida after the match. “We have to take catches and we have to take the opportunities for run outs. 
“We leaked too many runs in the last 10 overs and they went to 270. If we restricted them to 220 it would have been different.” 
Nida was full of praise for the effort Pakistan put with the ball and hoped the team would bounce back stronger in the next match, which is set to be held on Saturday.
“Sadia, Diana [Baig] and Tuba bowled well,” she said. “We did good things but we need to work on improving over our mistakes. We have to take responsibility; everyone is aware about their roles. I am very hopeful that we will bounce back.”.
Scores in brief: 
WEST INDIES 269-8 in 50 overs (Hayley Matthews 140 not out, Shemaine Campbelle 45, Chinelle Henry 23; Sadiq Iqbal 2-38, Tuba Hassan 2-48); PAKISTAN 156 in 35.5 overs (Tuba Hassan 25, Muneeba Ali 22, Najiha Alvi 20; Hayley Matthews 3-17, Zaida James 2-14, Afy Fisher 2-19).
