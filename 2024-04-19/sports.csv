1,Minor girl’s murder mystery resolved,"Police arrest young suspect for raping, killing and dumping victim’s body in a well","Gujjar Khan police have finally resolved the murder mystery of a 10-year-old girl and arrested the killer who lives in her neighbourhood. 
The body of the girl was spotted in the well of a house situated in Akbarabad Dalmi area. The suspect first abducted the girl, subjected her to sexual violence, strangled her and dumped her body in the well in an attempt to give the incident the look of an accident. 
The mother of Ayesha Noor complained to the Gujjar Khan police on April 6 that her husband works abroad. She has two sons and a 10-year-old daughter. Ayesha requested her to give money to buy chips. The girl received the money and went to a shop but didn’t return. Despite an extensive search, she couldn’t be located. The complainant suspected that her daughter might have been kidnapped or encountered some other unfortunate event.
A police team constituted by the Saddar SP Nabil Khokhar launched an extensive search for the missing girl and surveyed the surroundings of the victim’s house, encompassing both inhabited and deserted areas. Consequently, an inspection was conducted at a residence in the area where a man resided alone. Investigators found the girl’s body in a few feet-deep well at the residential property.
Police took the house owner into custody and performed an autopsy. The suspected man expressed ignorance about the presence of the body in his well. He, however, revealed that a local young man named Falak Sher used to visit him.
Police also took Falak Sher into custody and interrogated him after the victim’s family recalled that in the past he attempted to misbehave and abuse the girl's mother. The suspect finally confessed to abducting the girl, raping and strangling her to death and later dumping her body in the well.
Earlier, Rawalpindi City Police Officer Syed Khalid Hamdani promptly responded to the incident by establishing specialised teams to trace the blind murder. Led by the Saddar SP, the Gujjar Khan police thoroughly investigated all possible angles and successfully apprehended the culprit while utilising advanced technology and human intelligence. The investigation police will submit a complete challan with substantial evidence in court. Meanwhile, SSP Operations Hafiz Kamran Asghar commended the Saddar SP and his police team for apprehending the accused.

3,Traders for relocation of Rawalpindi cricket stadium,Say their businesses suffer due to road blocks and stringent security measures,"Shopkeepers along Food Street and Shamsabad Double Road in Rawalpindi are up in arms over the sealing of entrance gates and parking lots along Cricket Stadium Road. They are also protesting the suspension of public transport on Shamsabad Double Road during the ongoing cricket matches between Pakistan and New Zealand.
Expressing displeasure over the stringent measures enforced by the police and district administration, the shopkeepers lamented the disruption to their businesses. They noted that during match series, even carts selling fruits and vegetables in nearby areas are forced to relocate. Furthermore, Shamsabad metro station stops are temporarily closed, with passengers redirected to Faizabad station.
The shopkeepers and citizens are calling for the relocation of the cricket stadium from its current location to either Parade Ground or Shukarparian. They argue that for the past two decades, the stadium's presence has caused significant inconvenience, with roads, schools, and private offices shuttered during foreign team matches. The closure of Food Street and restrictions on road access exacerbate the situation for locals.
Fawad Khan, vice president of the Food Street Union, proposed that if Food Street must be closed during matches, they should be allowed to offer takeaway and parcel services with appropriate security measures.
Faisal Ali, a tea stall owner on Food Street, said that he is struggling to meet his household expenses due to the closure of his business during matches.
Akhtar Mehmood, Senior Vice President of the Shamsabad Double Road Anjuman Tajaran, highlighted the adverse impact on the approximately 500 shops, 100 private offices, and six private schools lining the road. He urged the immediate relocation of the cricket stadium to Parade Ground Islamabad to minimise security costs and preserve citizens' livelihoods.
Meanwhile, citizens are worried by the closure of the entrance gate to families visiting Allama Iqbal Park and the prohibition of vehicle parking in its lot. The closure of shops, offices, and Food Street along Shamsabad Double Road is expected to persist for the duration of the matches, until April 21.

4,IHC rebukes sleuth for slow probe,IHC expresses dissatisfaction with the progress of an investigation into a citizen's death in a road accident,"The Islamabad High Court Thursday expressed dissatisfaction with the progress of an investigation into a citizen's death in a road accident within the Khanna police station's jurisdiction two years ago.
This judicial rebuke came alongside directives to submit reports regarding the investigation's status and an explanation for the delayed appointment of the Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) within a strict two-week timeline.
IHC Chief Justice Aamir Farooq presided over the case concerning the tragic demise of a citizen due to a road accident under the Khanna police station's jurisdiction. During the hearing, Rafaqat, the deceased's father, attended the court session accompanied by legal counsel. Public prosecutor Zohaib Gondal was also present.
The investigating officer appeared in the court and asserted that the petitioner's statement had been recorded, an FIR filed, and investigations were ongoing regarding the incident.
However, Chief Justice Farooq expressed dismay, questioning the progress made in the investigation and emphasising the responsibility of the police in such matters. He queried the timeline of events, specifically the registration date of the FIR.
The petitioner’s legal representative highlighted the elapsed two-year period since the FIR registration, stressing the lack of arrests in connection with the case. The investigating officer acknowledged the FIR's registration in 2022 but was unable to provide substantial progress updates, prompting further scrutiny from the chief justice.
Expressing frustration at the slow pace of proceedings, Chief Justice Farooq probed into the timeframe stipulated by law for submitting the challan, a legal document detailing charges against the accused. The investigating officer mentioned the 14-day deadline for challan submission as per legal requirements.
However, the chief justice rebuffed this explanation, questioning the delay in action and implying negligence by the investigating authorities. He sternly warned of potential consequences, including imprisonment and job termination for failure to complete the investigation within the set timeframe.
In a noteworthy move, Chief Justice Farooq directed Deputy Attorney General Syed Ahsan Raza to explain the delay in appointing the IG Islamabad. He emphasised the need for prompt action, suggesting that either a new IG should be appointed promptly or the existing IGs should continue until a replacement is finalised.
The Deputy Attorney General acknowledged a notification regarding the IG's appointment but was met with skepticism from the chief justice, who demanded a detailed report within two weeks, linking the delayed IG appointment to the broader issue of prolonged investigations within the police department.
The court adjourned the hearing for two weeks, signalling a strict deadline for action on both the investigation and the IG's appointment, underscoring the judiciary's commitment to expeditious legal processes and administrative accountability.

6,Lad lands behind bars for harassing women in Rawalpindi,Bani police officials allegedly interfere with legal process against suspect,"A youth was arrested from the Sadiqabad area of Rawalpindi on Thursday for harassing women.
According to a police spokesperson, the man was apprehended following locals’ complaints
However, the situation took a contentious turn when two officials from the Bani police station allegedly interfered with the legal process against the accused, drawing criticism from the area's inhabitants.
Acting Rawalpindi CPO Hafiz Kamran Asghar, intervened by assigning DSP Newtown as the investigating officer and requesting a detailed report on the incident. He emphasised the possibility of strict disciplinary actions against the implicated officials if found guilty of neglecting their duties.
According to police reports, complaints were lodged via helpline 15 by residents of Sadiqabad, citing instances of the young man harassing women who were dropping off their children at school. Subsequently, the Sadiqabad police responded swiftly, apprehending the suspect identified as Waqas, who was engaging in indecent behaviour towards women.
However, during the legal proceedings, concerns arose regarding the involvement of an Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) from the police station and an officer from the Bani police station, allegedly using their positions to favour the accused.
This development led to a protest by the local community, including residents of Sadiqabad Iqbal Town, expressing dissatisfaction with the actions of the police officials. The demonstrators highlighted ongoing complaints about inappropriate behaviour towards women in the area. The protesters demanded an impartial inquiry by the interior minister, Rawalpindi RPO, and Rawalpindi CPO, urging departmental punishment for the implicated officials and enhanced protection for the area's residents against such misconduct.
Acting CPO Rawalpindi Hafiz Kamran Asghar reiterated the seriousness of the matter, mentioning the assignment of DSP Newtown as the inquiry officer and the initiation of a comprehensive report. Meanwhile, SP Rawal Faisal Saleem assured that legal measures were underway against the offenders responsible for harassing women and girls, affirming a zero-tolerance policy towards violence, harassment, and mistreatment of women and children.

The hospital is currently working under the District Health Authority (DHA).
The action has been recommended against the MS under the Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline, and Accountability (PEEDA) Act, while the action has also been recommended against the hospital's junior pharmacy technician, female pharmacist, in-charge nurse and pharmacy manager under departmental rules. A warning has also been issued to the female head nurse, the director of emergency and a doctor not to show any neglect in their duties in future.
