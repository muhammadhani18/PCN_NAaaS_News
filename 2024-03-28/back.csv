0,PTI rejects inquiry commission on judges' letter,Announces holding country’s ‘biggest ever rally’ in Peshawar on Sunday," 
The PTI has announced holding the country’s ""biggest ever political rally"" in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s (K-P) provincial capital on Sunday, rejecting the inquiry commission that will probe the allegations leveled by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges.
The rally, scheduled to commence at 2pm on March 31, aims to advocate for the independence of the judiciary and the release of ""Prisoner No 804"", said PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan on Thursday.
Gohar was addressing the media along with PTI leaders Sher Afzal Marwat and Faisal Javed after meeting with former prime minister Imran Khan—Prisoner No 804—at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail.
The announcement of the rally came amid a controversy whipped up by a letter penned by six IHC judges to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).

In the missive, the judges revealed the coercive tactics employed by intelligence agencies to influence judges—revelations that sent shockwaves across the legal and political landscape.
The PTI chairman disclosed that he had engaged in a 45-minute dialogue with Imran Khan, marking their first interaction following the letter-gate scandal.
Expressing profound dismay over the contents of the letter, Gohar underscored Imran Khan's commitment to upholding the sanctity of the judiciary, asserting that the PTI founder remains deeply perturbed by attempts to manipulate judicial processes.
PTI core committee meeting
In its meeting on Thursday, the PTI Core Committee firmly dismissed the establishment of an inquiry commission by the federal government to probe into the contents of the letter by IHC judges.
It also expressed deep apprehension over Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa’s meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “regarding this critical matter concerning the national judiciary and legal integrity”.
The party reiterated its demand to refer the issue to a larger bench of the Supreme Court for transparent and open proceedings.
Highlighting the gravity of the situation, the committee emphasised that the judges' letter stands as an indictment against federal government agencies.
It criticised the notion of appointing a retired judge for an inquiry into such a serious matter involving serving high court judges, deeming it a farce lacking independence and impartiality.
The party said the judges' letter has unveiled a significant threat to the judiciary's autonomy. It accused the government “formed by stealing public mandate” of being the prime beneficiary of ongoing unconstitutional interventions in the country.
The party vehemently argued against “an unelected prime minister” or his administration leading any investigation, citing a lack of credibility and impartiality.
Instead, it called upon CJ Isa to ensure justice for fellow judges and prevent the judiciary's fate from falling into the hands of government proxies.
Responding to the judges' plea, the PTI proposed a judicial conference to allow judges at all levels to present their perspectives on the matter, thus ensuring transparency and accountability before the nation.

1,SC stops FIA from arresting journalists,Lawyer says FIA has become accustomed to misuse of PECA,"A three member bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, ordered the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday not to arrest any journalist till the next hearing of the suo motu case against the alleged harassment of journalists.
During the hearing, the lawyer for the Press Association of the Supreme Court, Barrister Salahuddin, argued that action was taken against journalists in the name of violation of privacy. The chief justice asked the lawyer how he would define ‘privacy’.
Salahuddin said that the FIA had become accustomed to the misuse of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA). He added that the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had declared PECA’s Section 20 null and void. He replied in negative, when the chief justice asked whether the decision was challenged.
The chief justice noted that the notices to the journalists were issued under Section 160 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which was before the registration of any first information report (FIR). He asked the lawyer, why he thought of the registration of the FIR because of the notice.
The chief justice pointed out that many times there was a pressure from the above, so the officials send a notice to ward off the pressure, yet no FIR was registered and no arrest was made. Under this notice, he added, they could call anyone as witness.
Chief Justice Isa then told the lawyer that the court would not invalidate a legal process, adding that it would invalidate something only if it was proved illegal. He then asked the lawyer where was violation of the law in the issuance of the notice.
The defence counsel said that it was important that complete details of the case be provided along with the notice. He added that notice could be sent only if the FIR has been registered. The chief justice remarked that maybe the official was calling someone to verify the facts.
Later, the court adjourned the hearing till April 2 and declared that the FIA should not arrest the journalists until the next hearing.

2,Certified election form a critical right: IHC,"ECP tells court it has ordered relevant RO to provide PTI leaders with Form 45, 47","The election oversight authority has informed the Islamabad High Court (IHC) that it has instructed the relevant returning officer (RO) and the provincial election commissioner to provide forms related to the results of the February 8 general elections to certain PTI leaders.
The IHC on Wednesday resumed hearing petitions filed by PTI members Shoaib Shaheen and Salman Akram Raja, challenging the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not providing certified copies of Form 45 and Form 47.
During the hearing, IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq remarked that obtaining certified copies of the forms is a fundamental right of the applicants.
""Some contempt of court allegations have also been made against you. It will be regrettable if contempt of court proceedings are initiated against you due to such a trivial matter,"" Justice Farooq addressed the ECP officials.
The ECP official informed the bench that the election oversight authority has instructed the concerned RO and provincial election commissioner to provide the applicants with certified copies of the forms.
Shaheen confirmed that he had been provided with the forms.
""I have not yet checked them. Our request is that forms for provincial assembly constituencies should also be provided along with those for the National Assembly. According to the law, the ECP is obligated to provide forms,"" he added.
Form 45 is utilized by the Presiding Officer (PO) at each polling station to record the results of the count. It contains details such as the total number of registered voters, the number of votes polled for each candidate, and any rejected ballot papers.
After completing the counting process, the PO fills out Form 45, which is then signed by the PO, the polling agents, and the ECP's observer, if present. Copies of Form 45 are provided to the polling agents present at the polling station.
Form 47 is used to account for the ballot papers issued to each polling station. It includes details such as the total number of ballot papers received, used, unused, spoiled, and rejected.
It is filled out by the PO and is also signed by polling agents and the ECP's observer. It helps ensure transparency and accountability in the management of ballot papers during the electoral process.
These forms play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and transparency of elections in Pakistan by providing an official record of the voting process and results at each polling station.

3,Alleged May 9 rioters get relief in Rawalpindi,Trial courts grant bail to 19 more accused in the wake of SC’s March 20 order,"The PTI received further relief on Wednesday as trial courts in Rawalpindi granted bail to 19 more individuals who were arrested in the garrison city for allegedly vandalizing state and military properties following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan on May 9, 2023.
The trial courts granted bail to these 19 individuals, who had been detained in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for around 10 months, upon submission of surety bonds of Rs. 50,000 each and ordered their immediate release.
Interestingly, all individuals booked in Rawalpindi after the May 9 incidents have now been released except for eight PTI workers who were tried under the Pakistan Army Act, 1952.
These eight accused were tried by three different military courts in Rawalpindi, with the courts reserving their orders after concluding the trial. These orders are expected to be unveiled within a week.
The military courts also conducted trials of four other accused against whom cases were registered following the May 9, 2023 incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s (K-P) Abbottabad district.
After the May 9 incidents, authorities in Rawalpindi registered 14 different First Information Reports (FIRs) under which a total of 549 PTI leaders and workers, including former prime minister Imran Khan and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, were arrested.
In these cases, 34 accused were later discharged. The cases involved allegations of attacks on the GHQ, Army Museum, and offices of sensitive institutions. Arrest warrants were issued for 31 central leaders of the PTI, with 27 of these leaders later declared proclaimed offenders.
The leaders declared proclaimed offenders include Zain Qureshi, Hammad Azhar, Lt Gen (Retd) Akram Sahi, Zulfi Bukhari, Murad Saeed, Usman Saif Basra, Usman Dar, and Zartaj Gul.
Arrest warrants were issued for the K-P Chief Minister, Ali Amin Gandapur, Murad Saeed, former MPA Raja Rashid Hafeez, Ijaz Khan Jazi, and former provincial law minister Raja Basharat.
Last week, on March 20, a five-member Supreme Court bench granted bail to five suspects involved in the May 9 incidents. All these accused were named in the FIRs registered in Rawalpindi.

4,World Bank releases first tranche of loan for PMD upgrade,"$50m project aims at digitisation of observatories, and other facilities","The World Bank has released the first tranche of its $50 million loan for the restructuring and upgradation of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) aimed at enabling the department to cater to the training needs of its counterparts in the region.
The project titled ‘Modernization of Hydromet Services of PMD in Pakistan’ will use the World bank loan to digitise the department, and upgrade its observatories from the current manual network to automatic system.
Under the project, according to sources, 300 automatic weather stations and five bigger radars will be installed in the country. Besides for the first time, three mobile weather radars and supercomputers will also be provided to the PMD.
The sources said that the PMD would also be made self-sufficient in terms of acquiring equipment with the help of the World Bank. For this purpose, the PMD workshop will be modernised with staff training on modern lines.
The aim of the digitisation is to enable the PMD to provide training to its counterparts in Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and other countries. The sources said that many Gulf countries had contacted Pakistan for the training of their personnel.
They added that agreements had been reached with Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan for this training purpose. With the release of the first instalment of the loan, work on PMD modernisation project had already begun, the sources said.

5,PHC orders swearing in of newly-notified K-P lawmakers,Bench allows petitions of opposition MPAs elected on reserved seats,"The Peshawar High Court (PHC) ordered on Wednesday for administering oath to the newly-notified members of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) assembly on the reserved seats for women and non-Muslims, belonging to the opposition parties.
A two-member division bench, comprising Justice SM Atiq Shah and Justice Shakeel Ahmed, allowed the petition filed by the newly-notified lawmakers from the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F).
Earlier, the bench heard the arguments from both sides. The petitioners contended that the provincial assembly speaker was not administering the oath to them. However, the lawyer for the speaker contested that claim, saying that it was not the case.
The issue stemmed from the allocation of the reserved seats to the opposition parties, instead of the ruling Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which had gathered the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed independents. The SIC said that those seats were its right as per its strength in the assembly.
However, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had declined to allocated the reserved seats to the SIC because it had not applied for such allocation, nor it provided its priority list to the ECP before the February 8 polls, which is mandatory under the election laws. The PHC has also upheld the ECP decision.
Consequently, those seats were allocated to other parties in the house as per their priority lists. The opposition alleged that the speaker was delaying the oath to the new members to prevent them from voting for the opposition candidates in the upcoming Senate elections, scheduled for April 2.
Earlier, this month, K-P Governor Haji Ghulam Ali had summoned the assembly session on March 22 using his special powers under Article 109 of the Constitution to administer the oath to the new members. However, the speaker did not hold the session.
During the hearing on Wednesday, the bench asked whether the governor could summon the session. Advocate General Shah Faisal Utmankhel said that when the chief minister was not present or there was no-confidence motion against him, the governor could convene the session under Article 109.
He emphasised that Article 109 should be read with Article 105. On that Justice Shakeel Ahmed remarked the Article 109 did not use the words subject to any other article of the Constitution. He said that the members, who had been notified, had the right to be sworn in.
After hearing the lengthy arguments from both sides, the bench reserved its ruling, which was pronounced later in the day. The court ordered that the members elected on the reserved seats be administered the oath.

6,Umrah aspirants facing passport delay,Waiting period increases despite applicants reducing by half in Ramazan,"Despite the fact that the daily number of passport applicants have halved during the holy month of Ramazan, the country’s intending Umrah pilgrims are still facing difficulties in obtaining the travel document.
Sources said the number of applicants in the passport offices of Karachi was usually around 4,000 per day, but it had reduced to 1,800 to 2,000 in the month of Ramazan.
Even through the number of applications for issuance of new passports has declined significantly, the citizens who had completed the process for acquiring it before the month of Ramazan are still waiting to receive their travel document.
According to the sources, most of those waiting for passports are citizens who want to perform Umrah.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, the citizens said they had visited the offices several times to obtain their passports.
The surprising thing is that despite a message being received through SMS, they are told that their passport had not been printed.
The citizens have alleged that instead of finding a permanent solution to the problem, the administration was advising them to receive their passports through the fast-track service by paying extra money.
Sources in the passport office said there was a delay in the delivery of normal travel documents because of “technical” problems.
However, they added that the timely delivery of passports was being made possible on urgent and fast-track applications.
The fee for a normal passport having 36 pages is Rs4,500 and is supposed to be issued after 21 working days.
Similarly, the fee for an urgent passport having 36 pages is Rs7,500 and is supposed to be issued within five days.
Meanwhile, the fee for a fast-tack passport having 36 pages with a five-year validity is Rs10,000 and issued after two working days.
In November last year, a shortage of lamination paper, which is used in passports and typically imported from France, had resulted in a pendency of millions of travel documents.
Later in December, it was announced that the issue of delay in the issuance of passports had been resolved as lamination paper had been arranged by the authorities.
This inefficiency was not a one-off event. Back in 2013, passport printing came to a similar grinding halt because of the Directorate General of Immigration & Passports owing money to printers and a lack of lamination papers.

7,Karachi Airport grapples with flight cancellations,Passenger numbers dwindle amid observance of Ramazan," 
The Karachi Airport witnessed a flurry of flight cancellations on Wednesday as dwindling passenger numbers continue to plague the aviation sector.
Sources within the industry revealed that more than a dozen flights from various airlines scheduled to depart from Karachi Airport were axed.
The ongoing trend of decreased passenger loads has been exacerbated by the observance of Ramazan.
Among the affected flights were two international routes. Pakistan International Airlines' (PIA) PK-330 bound for Multan, AirSial's PF-121 destined for Lahore, Air Blue's PA 200 headed to Islamabad, and Serene Air's flight to Peshawar all faced cancellations.
Similarly, PIA’s PK-368 flight bound for Islamabad at 4 pm also fell victim to cancellation.
In a further blow, sources disclosed that Air Blue's EK-607 flight to Dubai scheduled departure from Karachi at 6 pm was also axed, compounding the woes for travellers.

8,"Utilize power plants fully, IMF advises",Lender proposes lowering power tariffs strategy,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has proposed measures to lower the power tariff for various consumer categories, suggesting an enhancement of the energy mix and a reduction in capacity charges by fully utilizing new power plants.
Sources within the Ministry of Finance revealed that the IMF has advised the government to operate new power plants at their maximum capacity to address the country's energy requirements effectively.
Consumers currently bear an annual burden of around Rs2 trillion due to capacity charges resulting from the underutilization of new power plants.
The IMF underscores the necessity of decreasing capacity charges to lower industrial tariffs. Utilizing power plants at full capacity by incorporating alternative fuels could potentially slash capacity charges in electricity prices by Rs13 to Rs16 per unit.
The IMF specifically recommends the operation of 5,000-megawatt gas power plants fueled by indigenous gas, which could generate electricity at a significantly cheaper rate of Rs10 to Rs14 per unit compared to LNG. Ensuring uninterrupted power supply to all industrial zones is a critical aspect of the IMF's proposal.
The term ""energy mix"" denotes the blend of various energy sources utilized by a country or region to generate electricity. This mix typically includes renewable sources like solar, wind, hydroelectric, and biomass, alongside non-renewable sources such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear power.
Managing the energy mix aims to strike a balance between energy security, affordability, and environmental sustainability.
Capacity charges, also known as capacity payments or tariffs, refer to fees paid to power generators or suppliers for their capability to deliver a certain amount of electricity to the grid, regardless of actual usage.
These charges are essential for ensuring electricity availability during peak demand periods or supply shortages, covering fixed costs associated with power generation infrastructure like power plants and transmission lines.
Capacity charges are often structured as payments per kilowatt of installed capacity and are separate from charges based on actual electricity consumption.

9,Cipher case trial termed ‘unfair’,IHC told cipher case ‘retaliation’ against Imran,"PTI founding chairman Imran Khan’s counsel Barrister Salman Safdar on Wednesday contended before the Islamabad High Court that registering the cipher case only against his client was an ‘act of retaliation’ as others had not returned the copies of the diplomatic cable until it was filed.
A division bench of the IHC, comprising its Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, heard Imran as well as PTI vice chairman and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s appeals against their conviction in the case.
During the hearing, Safdar maintained that the requirements of a fair trial under Article 10A had not been fulfilled. The lawyer told the court that the diplomatic cable was not shown to the investigation officer (IO) terming it ‘secret’.
He added that the IO should have approached the magistrate. Safdar continued that the IO had presented the challan without even reading the document. He further noted that the trial court judge had also framed the charges without perusing the diplomatic cable.
The bench observed that the judge could have ordered under the Official Secrets Act that the document should be shown after removing all the people from the courtroom.
Drawing similarities, the lawyer said it just like as if it was a murder case but the body was missing. He told the court that the matter was related to foreign affairs but was ‘hijacked’ by the interior ministry.
“Instead of the Foreign Office, the interior ministry became the complainant,” he added. The lawyer noted that the ministry in its complaint maintained that if the diplomatic cable was not returned, the whole security system would be compromised.
Safdar noted that Imran and Qureshi had been accused of making the text of the cipher public and ‘twisting’ it for their personal gains. However, he expressed his surprise that neither the original document nor the ‘twisted’ one was available. The lawyer wondered how the text of both the documents could be compared when neither was in front of them. He further pointed out that the FIR was registered 17 months after the then premier Imran’s copy was not returned.
Safdar observed that the prosecution claimed that the copies of the diplomatic cable were sent to five people.
However, he noted that the document of one of the prosecution witnesses read that the copies were sent to nine people instead of five.
“This is their cipher security system,” he sarcastically said.
The lawyer said with the exception of the then president Dr Arif Alvi, the copies of the diplomatic cable were not returned by those who had them until the case was registered.
Safdar recalled that a meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) was held in March 2022 under the chairmanship of the then premier Imran.
He added that the committee had termed the ‘cipher message’ an ‘intolerable’ interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs.
Imran’s counsel reminded the bench that another meeting of the NSC was held 22 days later under the chairmanship of PM Shehbaz Sharif that verified the stance of the previous huddle.
However, he continued that the NSC under PM Shehbaz had refuted the existence of a foreign conspiracy.
Justice Aurangzeb asked the lawyer what he meant by the term conspiracy.
The judge pointed out that the statement released by the NSC after the earlier meeting did not mention any conspiracy.
He inquired if this was the same conspiracy that Imran had spoken about during a public gathering.
Later, the IHC adjourned the hearing of the appeals till Thursday (today).
