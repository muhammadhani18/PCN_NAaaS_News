0,Rs1.2tr sought for power subsidies,Energy ministry demands 26% higher allocation despite massive rise in tariffs,"Despite phenomenally increasing electricity prices, the Ministry of Energy has sought a colossal Rs1.23 trillion in power subsidies for the next fiscal year, an increase of 26% over the allocation this year.
Funds are sought for mostly covering the difference between consumer prices and generation costs and for subsidies for Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), agricultural tube wells in Balochistan and circular debt reduction plan through a dividend scheme.
The Ministry of Energy’s demand for Rs1.234 trillion in power subsidies for the next fiscal year is 26% higher than the original allocation of Rs976 billion for the current fiscal year.
The demand has been placed for the budget of fiscal year 2024-25, which will be presented in parliament in June this year, according to sources in the energy ministry. The amount is subject to scrutiny by the Ministry of Finance and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Pakistan cannot make any major allocation in budget without prior consent of the IMF, if the country is keen to timely sign the Extended Fund Facility. The federal government had to print the budget books twice in June last year after the IMF refused to accept the budget presented in the National Assembly without its consent.
The total demand for Rs1.234 trillion appears on the higher side, as the government has been constantly increasing electricity prices on account of monthly, quarterly and annual tariff adjustments. Prices have hit the roof and consumers are now searching for off-the-grid energy solutions, resulting in a reduction in electricity demand.
During review talks, Pakistan has already agreed with the IMF on a further increase in electricity prices from July and in case of need it stands ready to jack up prices during this fiscal year as well to keep circular debt at the agreed level of Rs2.31 trillion.
An official of the finance ministry said that the demand would be reviewed in the coming days and final allocation would depend on the space available in the budget and the government’s energy policies.
An amount of Rs450 billion has been demanded for direct payment of tariff differential subsidy to consumers of less than 200 units per month – a cost the government pays due to the difference between the cost of generation and selling price. The demanded amount is Rs131 billion, or 41% higher, than the current fiscal year.

The government picks only one-third of the subsidies and the rest is forcefully charged from residential, commercial, industrial and CNG consumers.
Out of the Rs450 billion, the consumers of 10 power distribution companies will get Rs276 billion, up Rs126 billion, or 84%. Another Rs174 billion is being sought for K-Electric (KE) consumers, which is higher by Rs5 billion over this year’s budget.
For KE, the Ministry of Energy has sought a total of Rs262 billion, including Rs88 billion for the payment of subsidy arrears of previous years.
The federal government and KE signed various agreements a few months ago to end the dispute over subsidy payments and ensure timely payment of current subsidy.
Sources said that the Ministry of Energy had demanded an allocation of Rs100 billion for clearing the power-sector circular debt under the dividend ploughing back scheme. The interim government had proposed to clear Rs1.27 trillion worth of energy sector debt, including roughly Rs250 billion of the power sector. However, the IMF objected to the proposal.
The energy ministry has demanded a subsidy of Rs65 billion for ex-Fata, which is 67% more than this fiscal year. In addition, it sought Rs86 billion for clearing arrears of ex-Fata consumers.
There are, however, transparency and accuracy-related concerns about electricity subsidy claims for the erstwhile Fata and agricultural consumers of Balochistan.
Since the federally administered areas have been merged with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, there is a need to end unlimited power subsidies. The federal government has also been picking up the additional cost to end any disparity in economic development in the area.
The energy ministry has proposed Rs10 billion for the payment of subsidy to agricultural tube wells in Balochistan. The federal government has been paying its share of tube-well subsidy but the Ministry of Energy is unable to create efficiency in the distribution company.
Sources said that during the recent review talks, the IMF objected to the continuation of tube-well subsidy in Balochistan. The government assured the lender that no preferential treatment would be given to any particular set of consumers.
The ministry has sought a staggering Rs108 billion for AJK consumers, who are getting highly subsidised electricity. The claim is Rs83 billion, or 332%, higher than this fiscal year.
The Ministry of Energy has sought a subsidy of Rs40 billion to clear the backlog of the federal government. For this fiscal year, the finance ministry has refused to make these payments.
Subsidies worth Rs215 billion have been demanded to pay dues of private power producers under a three-year-old deal.
The ministry has demanded Rs24 billion for retiring the debt parked in a holding company. Consumers are forced to pay a surcharge of Rs3.23 per unit to bear the cost of interest on this debt.

1,"Visa, Mastercard reach $30 billion settlement","Some critics believe it may not go far enough, saying the savings would be temporary and fees would remain high","Visa and Mastercard reached an estimated $30 billion settlement to limit credit and debit card fees for merchants, with some savings likely to be passed on to consumers through lower prices.
The antitrust settlement announced on Tuesday is one of the largest in US history, and if it receives court approval would resolve most claims in nationwide litigation that began in 2005.
Some critics believe it may not go far enough, saying the savings would be temporary and fees would remain high. Merchants have long accused Visa and Mastercard of charging inflated swipe fees, or interchange fees, when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and barring them through “anti-steering” rules from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment.
Swipe fees typically include small fixed fees plus a percentage of total sale amounts, and average about 1.5% to 3.5% per transaction according to Bankrate.com.
Under the settlement, Visa and Mastercard would reduce swipe rates by at least four basis points for three years.

2,PRGMEA urges independent apparel policy,Butt called for the establishment of an Apparel Council at federal level to address sector-specific challenges,"The Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PRGMEA) is pressing for the revision of the Textile Policy, calling on the government to introduce a separate five-year ‘Apparel Policy’, detaching the garment sector from textiles. This call comes in light of the expiration of the GSP Plus status and the forthcoming submission of the US International Trade Commission’s (ITC) report on Pakistan’s apparel industry competitiveness at the end of August this year.
PRGMEA Central Chairman Mubashar Naseer Butt commended the government’s swift response to the US ITC report on the competitiveness of Pakistan’s apparel industry. He observed the significance of this move, stating that it presents a valuable opportunity for Pakistan’s apparel sector to enhance its exports. Highlighting the sector’s importance, Butt stressed the need to strengthen it and give it a distinct identity.
Read Apparel industry denounces banks
Butt advocated for the launch of a new and independent apparel policy aligned with the textile policy for the next five years. He called for the establishment of an Apparel Council at the federal level to address sector-specific challenges and stabilise textile exports. He also underscored the differences between the garment and textile sectors, reiterating the need for targeted policies.
The garment sector, with its potential to create jobs with relatively low investment and energy needs, holds immense promise. Butt pointed out the sector’s significance in global markets and highlighted the need for Pakistan to fully capitalise on emerging opportunities, especially in the US market.
Pakistan’s apparel sector, with around 85% of its exports going to the US, stands to benefit significantly from fully exploiting this opportunity. 
PRGMEA EC member Sajid Saleem Minhas highlighted the need for duty-free access to the US market and called for government support to enhance the competitiveness of the value-added textile industry.

3,Freelancers seek govt-association collaboration for IT park success,"Say consultation will ensure effective resource utilisation, address challenges in boosting exports","Praising the approval for Pakistan’s largest Information Technology (IT) park, set to benefit 6,000 freelancers, the Pakistan Freelancers Association (PAFLA) and industry experts call for government collaboration to optimise resources, address IT challenges, and boost e-service exports.
In discussions with The Express Tribune, they stress the need for consultation with PAFLA and Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) to navigate the project effectively, ensuring freelancer-friendly facilities and avoiding bureaucratic hurdles.
The recent approval by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) for the largest IT park in Islamabad aims to enhance the skills of freelancers and contribute significantly to the national economy through IT services. However, there is a pressing need for innovative thinking in bureaucratic circles to drive policy initiatives, implement regulatory reforms, and launch supportive programmes from grassroots to university levels. Additionally, it is crucial for the government to provide ethics training to freelancers to bridge the gap between rhetoric and action.
They highlighted that skilled freelancers play a crucial role in securing business opportunities and contributing to the national economy. Currently, with the economy’s paramount importance, individuals are increasingly seeking opportunities in US dollars. While less skilled freelancers face challenges in producing quality content, those proficient in their fields aim to advance their expertise, particularly in Artificial Intelligence (AI). As the national economy strengthens and people diversify their investments away from property and stocks, there’s a growing shift towards the tech industry, fostering the development of innovative software and startups that create jobs and address local economic challenges.
Read Thousands of freelancers set to benefit as Pakistan’s largest IT park gets go-ahead
“Freelancers encounter several challenges across cities, including limited access to fast and affordable internet connectivity and inconsistent electricity supply, which significantly impact their productivity and timely client deliverables,” stated PAFLA Chairman Ibrahim Amin. He noted recent government efforts to address some of these issues and reiterated the need for gradual measures to support foreign exchange earners.
Amin highlighted that the government, through banks, now enables freelancers to retain 50% of their earnings in foreign currency accounts for larger projects. Additionally, various banking channels offer options for receiving payments from foreign clients. He commended the government’s initiatives to establish freelancer workspaces like the IT park, which are crucial in mitigating internet and electricity-related challenges.
AI Strategist and Freelancer Coach Khawaja Fahad Shakeel highlighted several challenges faced by freelancers, including payment delays, limited access to international clients, and inadequate online payment methods. He called for the government to focus on skill development, payment facilitation, legal protection, and regulatory reforms as solutions to these issues. 
Shakeel suggested collaboration with financial regulators and international partners to enhance access to online payment platforms like PayPal for secure transactions. He also proposed government support for initiatives that assist freelancers in marketing their services globally through training in marketing and networking skills. Lastly, he stressed the importance of promoting work-life balance among freelancers to manage their workload.
IT Analyst Muhammad Yasir highlighted the challenges faced by freelancers globally, including those in Pakistan, due to the rapid emergence of new technologies like AI, which are gradually replacing their roles or increasing their workload.
He underlined the necessity for freelancers to continually adapt to these advancements, enhancing their expertise to efficiently complete projects. Yasir reiterated the importance of mastering policies and strategies for attracting clients and maintaining a positive reputation to thrive in the evolving freelance landscape.

5,MNCs witness over 3-fold surge in profit repatriation,"Foreign firms transfer $759.2m abroad in first eight months amid improved reserves, stability","The repatriation of profits and dividends by multinational companies (MNCs) from Pakistan to their headquarters abroad surged by 3.4 times, reaching $759.2 million in the first eight months of the current fiscal year 2023-24, thanks to improved foreign currency supplies in the domestic economy.
The sectors leading in profit and dividend dispatches included petroleum refineries, power, and financial businesses in the eight-month period. According to State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, repatriation had dropped to $225.4 million in the same period of the previous fiscal year 2022-23, following a decline in foreign exchange reserves to critically low levels.
In February 2024 alone, profit and dividend dispatches amounted to $65 million, marking a 13-fold increase compared to the $5 million sent in the same month the previous year. However, dispatches slowed down compared to the previous month of January 2024, which saw $126.6 million being sent.
Despite the increase, February’s repatriation remained lower than the normal monthly average range of $100-150 million, reflecting the impact of the central bank’s unannounced ban on dispatches in July 2022, which was lifted in August 2023.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Tahir Abbas, Head of Research at Arif Habib Limited, attributed the resumption of profit and dividend dispatches to the improvement in the country’s foreign exchange reserves. He noted that reserves had recovered to above $8 billion by March 15, 2024, from below $4 billion in June 2023.
Read Banks achieve 86% growth in profits
During the period of low reserves, there was a heightened risk of default on repayment of maturing foreign debt, prompting authorities to temporarily slow down dispatches. Abbas highlighted that foreign companies were not only sending profits and dividends earned in the December 2023-end quarter but also clearing backlogs from the previous period.
The inability to dispatch funds between July 2022 and July 2023 was due to the foreign exchange reserves crisis during that time, as noted by Abbas.
According to an official of the Overseas Chambers of Commerce and Industry, foreign companies typically repatriated funds ranging from $1.5 billion to $2 billion annually. Abbas attributed the recent increase in repatriation to higher export earnings, improved inflows of workers’ remittances, and the disbursement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s $3 billion loan programme, which began in late June 2023.
Abbas estimated that full-year repatriation in FY24 could reach $1 billion, anticipating further increases with the receipt of the third and final tranche of the IMF loan and the government’s intention to secure a larger and longer loan programme after the current one ends in April 2024.

6,SIFC to push ahead with plan to develop chip industry,"Govt needs to offer tax incentives, other facilities to encourage foreign firms","The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) has geared up to press ahead with the plan of developing a multibillion-dollar chip design and semiconductor industry in Pakistan.
Sources told The Express Tribune that the government would be required to provide tax incentives and other facilitating programmes to foreign companies, especially Chinese and US investors, to encourage them to set up chip designing centres in Pakistan.
They revealed that the proposal of a government-to-business (G2B) chip designing facility and development of the semiconductor industry was floated in the SIFC in a bid to draw investment of billions of dollars.
It was suggested that Pakistan would have to start from testing and research and then it should develop the semiconductor industry. Estimates suggest that the setting up of a foundry for semiconductor manufacturing requires an investment of around $6-7 billion. Apart from capital, Pakistan has scarcity of trained human resources as well.
“For developing the semiconductor industry, which is associated with smartphone and many other industries, we will have to take small steps by winning the confidence of companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, MediaTek and Unisoc, which can invest in testing departments,” remarked Muhammad Naqi, CEO of Premier Code, while talking to The Express Tribune.
He pointed out that Pakistan had a dearth of skilled resources, for which “we will have to update our curriculum to ensure that we have the required people”.
Along with this, Pakistan needs to create a softer image of the country where visitors and investors can come without any security fears. “Small steps will help us to go a long way. We cannot jump from 0 to 100 but we will have to take a step-by-step approach to progress in the field,” Naqi said.
Read China says US subsidies, tax incentives for domestic chip sector discriminatory
Mobile phones are a low-hanging fruit, especially in Pakistan, owing to their high sales volume. The government can help local brands to expand their market share, go for localisation of components and value addition, and protect intellectual property rights.
China and India have adopted the same approach to make their local brands global giants.
Initial work on developing the chip and semiconductor industry kicked off in 2022. The government at that time formulated the Pakistan National Semiconductor Plan that laid down opportunities, challenges and recommendations.
It pointed to several challenges in developing the semiconductor industry, which was almost non-existent in Pakistan.
A major challenge is that Pakistan does not have a good reputation when it comes to the ease of setting up and operating a business. This can be overcome by highlighting the recent changes in the ease of doing business in the country.
It noted that Pakistani universities were not producing trained graduates who could work on designing chips. This can be addressed by setting up advanced training centres that will bridge the gap between the academia and the industry.
Also, the government does not offer any incentive plan to encourage chip designing companies to install such facilities. It recommended the resolution of the issue by offering world-class incentives that could help bring US and Chinese companies to Pakistan.
Pakistan has a complex customs regime that is difficult for companies to navigate and it is also quite expensive when compared with international standards. This can be simply addressed by implementing a one-stop shop solution with a “zero-in, zero-out policy”, experts say.
In terms of opportunities, Pakistan has a chance to become the next best destination for semiconductor design and manufacturing because of a large pool of low-cost human resources. This has now provided a unique opportunity due to the US-China trade war.

7,PIA Holding Company approves Rs268b debt restructuring,"Govt aims to privatise airline by June 11th, with bids invited as early as next week","The Pakistan International Airline Holding Company board on Wednesday approved the restructuring of the airline’s Rs268 billion commercial debt, incorporating it into the public debt. The term sheet was finalised by the Ministry of Finance with commercial banks. The government’s decision to merge the airline’s debt into public debt means that taxpayers will bear the cost of PIA’s inefficiency and mismanagement.
In its hastily convened inaugural meeting, the newly constituted PIA holding company board swiftly approved the term sheet for restructuring the Rs268 billion debt. Former Special Assistant to the Prime Minister, Tariq Bajwa, chaired the board meeting. The meeting was convened urgently, and directors attended virtually without adequate time to review the terms in detail.
According to the approved term sheet, banks have agreed to extend their debt for ten years and reduce interest rates from the existing approximately 23.5% to a maximum of 12%. If the government fails to privatise PIA within three years, banks will have the right to reopen the deal and demand an interest rate equal to prevailing rates in 2027.
Following board approval, the government will file the scheme of arrangement with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). The government aims to privatise PIA by June 11th, with bids possibly invited as early as next week.
Essentially, PIA Company will split into two, with the airline’s bad debts, including commercial loans, trade debts, and government borrowings, transferred to the holding company. Over Rs650 billion of the Rs825 billion PIA debt will be transferred to the holding company, leaving a clean PIA to be sold to investors.
The decision to include the airline’s debt in the public debt and allocate annual interest payments from the budget shifts the responsibility for PIA’s inefficiency to taxpayers. The government will make annual interest payments of Rs32 billion to banks, with the debt in the holding company either settled from privatisation proceeds or paid from the budget.
Read PIA sell-off, IMF loan send PSX to new high
The holding company’s mandate is limited to discharging PIA’s liabilities and does not include raising fresh loans. Commercial banks have priority rights over the holding company’s assets.
Under the decision, the Rs268 billion debt, including Rs18 billion interest, has been rescheduled, now the responsibility of the federal government. The deal’s cut-off date is the end of December 2023.
This arrangement means banks will receive over Rs300 billion in interest payments over a decade, exceeding their outstanding stocks of Rs268 billion. Sources indicate the total pay-out to banks at a 12% interest rate will be Rs573 billion over ten years.
However, the government has provided special treatment for the foreign currency loan of $88 million obtained from the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) and Habib Bank Limited (HBL). This decision imposes an additional burden on the exchequer due to high interest rates in dollar terms and exchange rate risks over the next five years.
Unlike the restructuring of domestic lending from commercial banks amounting to Rs243 billion, the finance ministry did not convert the $88 million or Rs25 billion foreign loan component into domestic currency.
A consortium of NBP and HBL provided a $88 million loan to PIA at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 5.4%, approximately 11% in dollar terms.
It has been decided that a portion of the $88 million will be settled, with $53 million transferred to the holding company without restructuring. NBP and HBL will provide equivalent rupee funding to the New Hold Company. The $53 million will be transferred to the books of the New Hold Company and repaid over five years at the existing interest rate of SOFR+ 5.4% per annum, equivalent to 11% in dollar terms.
Banks will have sovereign guarantees and exclusive rights to all present and future current and fixed assets of New Hold Company, excluding any interest or charge on Roosevelt Hotel.
However, if the government fails to privatise PIA within three years, commercial banks will have the right to reopen the deal and demand an interest rate equal to prevailing government borrowing rates.
Lenders will also have the right to reject future borrowing by the holding company.
Excluding the foreign currency component, HBL’s nearly Rs31 billion debt, NBP’s Rs48 billion, Bank of Punjab’s Rs59 billion, Askari Bank’s Rs34.5 billion, Faysal Bank’s Rs22.5 billion, JS Bank’s Rs22 billion, and Al Baraka Bank’s Rs7 billion debt have been rescheduled.

8,"PIA sell-off, IMF loan send PSX to new high","KSE-100 index surges 641.51 points, settles at 66,547.79","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday soared to a record high as it crossed the 66,500 milestone over progress in the privatisation process for state-owned Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and optimism about a new, larger International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme.
As trading commenced in the morning, the bourse continued its upward march with investors pushing the KSE-100 index above the resistance level of 66,000, which the market had failed to breach in the past many days.
The index got a boost from the PIA board of directors’ approval of the government’s plan to privatise the national flag carrier, ahead of securing the new IMF loan programme.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s statement that an agreement on the second phase of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was expected to be signed with Beijing soon rejuvenated investor confidence. Major contribution to the bullish momentum came from banking and fertiliser sectors.
The upward momentum was further aided by the rupee’s continuous stability, which took the KSE-100 to the intra-day high of 66,607.87. The index after shedding some points in the final hour closed above the 66,500 level.
“Stocks closed at a record high as government deliberated the PIA privatisation process and global investors’ interest in the ailing SOE (state-owned enterprise),” said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.
Read PSX extends gains, nears 66,000 mark
“Rupee stability, PM’s commitment to the second phase of CPEC and foreign fund inflows played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.” At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a surge of 641.51 points, or 0.97%, and settled at 66,547.79.
Topline Securities’ Deputy Head of Sales Ali Najib reported that finally the index broke the 66,000 barrier, which could be attributed to “positive vibes from the IMF, rejuvenated foreign interest at historically low valuations and progress on SOE privatisation”.
Investors chose to further strengthen their equity positions by buying blue-chip stocks across the board, he said. Resultantly, power, banking and fertiliser sectors contributed positively to the index as Hub Power, Meezan Bank, United Bank, MCB Bank and Engro Corporation added a total of 319 points.
On the flip side, Pakistan Petroleum, the National Bank of Pakistan and Millat Tractors saw some profit-taking as they cumulatively lost 67 points, he added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its review, wrote that the 66,000 resistance level was finally breached and it should now support the ascent to new all-time highs.
According to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Pakistan will be looking to conclude an IMF agreement for a new loan programme by the end of June or early July, it said.
AHL added that investors would be focusing on the FTSE equity country classification review after the close of US markets on Thursday, where Pakistan was on the watch list for potential demotion from secondary emerging to frontier market status.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala observed that the bourse made a significant breakthrough as the KSE-100 index surpassed the resistance level of 66,200.
Considerable investor interest was seen in banking and fertiliser sectors, he said. “Looking ahead, we suggest investors to consider a buy-on-dips strategy, particularly focusing on banking, E&P and technology sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 354.6 million shares against Tuesday’s tally of 303.7 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs11.9 billion.
Shares of 346 companies were traded. Of these, 179 stocks closed higher, 152 dropped and 15 remained unchanged.
Lotte Chemical was the volume leader with trading in 42.8 million shares, gaining Rs0.55 to close at Rs19.53. It was followed by Telecard Limited with 29.2 million shares, gaining Rs0.75 to close at Rs9.24 and PTCL with 24.7 million shares, gaining Rs1.21 to close at Rs17.31. Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs94.3 million, according to the NCCPL.
