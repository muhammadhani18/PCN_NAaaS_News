5,Parking company’s role to be evaluated,Official revenue declines while illegal stands mushroom,"The Punjab local government secretary has decided to re-evaluate the role of the Lahore Parking Company in view of complaints of the loss of millions of rupees caused by unauthorised parking stands in the city.
The company had been established by transferring powers from the metropolitan corporation to it to run a modern parking system.
According to sources, the income of the Lahore Parking Company has decreased despite the increase in the number of vehicles in the city and inflation during the past 12 years.
Investigations into fake receipts and embezzlement have also proved futile.
The number of official parking stands was reduced, but many stands have been illegally established.
The parking stands had been taken over from the metropolitan corporation in 2011 and handed over to the Lahore Parking Company so that they could be run on modern lines. As per the plan, the staff was to be retained and the parking fee had to be charged digitally in proportion to the time period for which the vehicles were parked. The vehicles were to be parked in an organised manner to avoid traffic problems.
There were 244 parking stands in the city at the time, but the annual income of Rs670,000 from the facility was considered low, which was supposed to increase by 10 to 20 per cent every year.
The parking fee for a motorcycle was Rs5 and for car Rs10.
After the establishment of the parking company, the motorcycle parking fee was fixed at Rs20 and car Rs30.
However, there is probably not a single parking stand in Lahore where the fees are being charged as per the official rates.
In upscale areas like the Main Boulevard, Garden Town, Liberty Market, Jail Road, Circular Road, big plazas, shopping malls, cinemas and theaters, parking fees of Rs100 to Rs200 are being charged for cars with impunity.
The number of officially operated parking stands in the city had reduced to 186, which is now over 200.
About two years ago, the metropolitan corporation and traffic police jointly conducted a survey, in which around 1,000 illegal parking stands were identified.
According to the parking company, its average income of Rs830,000 per day has dropped to Rs700,000 and is declining.
Under the metropolitan corporation, the municipal officers managed all the parking stands across the city. The facilities were run by less than a dozen inspectors and employees and the monthly income was increasing, the sources said.
But after the creation of the Lahore Parking Company, more than 500 employees could not increase the income.
The sources said the employees serving at the stands were also not receiving full salary. Deduction of salary because of short attendance has become common.
Complaints of citizens about excessive parking charges are also on the rise, while traffic problems have increased because of wrong parking.
A former civic service official, Sarfraz Hussain, estimated that the income could have increased to more than Rs350 million per year is the parking system had bene privatised.
Lahore Parking Company CEO Rafia Haider said appointments would be made soon on key posts of the organisation by the Punjab government.
“Our effort is to run the parking company in a better way. Action has been taken against corrupt employees. It is necessary for the parking company to appoint qualified officers to run the company on modern lines and help solve the problems, including those related to traffic,” she added.
Provincial Secretary Shakeel Ahmad Mian said while speaking to The Express Tribune that the Lahore Parking Company needed to be restructured in order to be run successfully.

6,City gripped by crimes amid surge in encounters,CCTV footage captures firefight at milk shop,"A series of police encounters during the past week resulted in the deaths of five suspected robbers, raising concerns about the escalation of criminal activities in the city.
The most dramatic encounter occurred on Wednesday, March 20, at a milk shop in Johar Town (BoR Road), captured on CCTV footage.
Four suspected robbers stormed the shop, holding the staff at gunpoint and looting valuables. Pretending to be shoppers to avoid suspicion, they stationed one suspect as a guard at the entrance to intercept anyone entering the shop.
Alerted by the shop owners via CCTV, the police swiftly responded to the scene.
A confrontation ensued, leading to an exchange of gunfire between the officers and the robbers.
Despite attempts by the suspects to use the shop staff as shields and escape by taking cover behind counters and refrigerators, they were eventually apprehended. However, one suspect sustained fatal injuries during the shootout, while three others were taken into custody.
Another encounter occurred in Raiwind City on March 18, when police received a report of three suspects involved in a robbery. Upon arrival, the officers were met with gunfire from the suspects.
In the ensuing exchange, two suspects were fatally shot, while the third managed to flee the scene.
On March 25, another police encounter in Sattokatla resulted in the deaths of two suspected robbers. Acting on a tip-off about a robbery in progress in Nawab Town, the police intercepted the suspects, who opened fire in an attempt to evade capture.
Two suspects succumbed to their injuries during the exchange of gunfire, later identified as Basharat Mushtaq and Ali Zeb.
In a separate incident on March 22, a man named Waqar Altaf died while in police custody in Township.
Allegedly detained in connection with a snatching case, Altaf reportedly suffered severe torture, leading to his demise despite being rushed to the hospital for treatment.
Earlier on March 15, a suspected robber was killed and two others injured during a police encounter in Defence B.
Responding to reports of a robbery in progress, the police engaged with the suspects, resulting in one fatality and the arrest of two others.
The deceased suspect was identified as Hanif, while the arrested individuals were named Tahir and Aftab. These incidents underscore the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in curbing criminal activities and maintaining public safety in Lahore.

She was informed that China imports $17 billion worth of meat and $2 billion worth of milk from the country annually.

8,Budget termed first step to put country on track,Minister says concerns raised by critics will be addressed next year,"Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman concluded a five-day general discussion on the annual budget 2023-24 in Punjab Assembly, asserting that it marked the first step by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government towards steering the country in the right direction.
Addressing queries from lawmakers, the finance minister assured them that the budget had been meticulously crafted to encompass all sectors, with particular emphasis on education and health, which are among the top priorities of the PML-N.
He also pledged that the upcoming budget would address concerns raised by critics, promising significant allocations to rectify the deteriorated state of sectors neglected during the previous regime.

He emphasised that the PML-N was committed to turning possibilities into realities, pledging relentless efforts to uplift the impoverished masses from their current predicament.
During the House proceedings, the Opposition's demand for details of any new FIRs registered against former PTI minister Mian Aslam Iqbal was accepted, addressing concerns over transparency and accountability. However, their request for assurances that he would neither be arrested nor abducted was overlooked, sparking further debate and contention.
Prior to the finance minister's concluding speech, the Opposition continued to highlight perceived shortcomings in the budget, while the treasury, although initially applauding the budget, also hinted at the need for greater emphasis on different sectors to ensure comprehensive development and progress.
Opposition leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar raised concerns over the lack of a protection order for their elected MPA Ahmed Rasheed Bhatti, underscoring the importance of ensuring the safety and security of elected representatives.
