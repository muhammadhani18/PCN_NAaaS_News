0,SC endorses inquiry over judges’ letter,Govt to form commission led by retired judge," 
Despite facing strong reservations from some judges, the Supreme Court endorsed on Thursday a proposal for a commission led by a retired judge to inquire into the letter written by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges regarding alleged interference of agencies in judicial functions.
Meanwhile, Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa unequivocally conveyed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that any interference by the executive in the affairs and judicial workings of judges would not be tolerated. He emphasized that under no circumstances would there be any compromise on the independence of the judiciary.
The chief justice and the senior puisne judge, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, told Prime Minister Shehbaz that the independence of judiciary was the foundational pillar that “upholds the rule of law and a strong democracy”.
Shehbaz, accompanied by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan, visited the Supreme Court on the desire of Chief Justice Isa to address the issue raised by the letter from the IHC judges. The meeting lasted for approximately one and a half hours.
During the discussion, it was proposed to establish an inquiry commission under the Pakistan Commissions of Inquiry Act, 2017, to be led by a retired judge of impeccable integrity to investigate the matter. Shehbaz pledged that a federal cabinet meeting would be convened to seek approval for the formation of the inquiry commission.
The prime minister endorsed the views expressed by the chief justice and the senior puisne judge and assured them that he would take appropriate measures to ensure independent judiciary, by issuing directions to the relevant departments, and initiating legislation in accordance with the paragraph 53 in Faizabad Dharna case judgment.
Later, the chief justice called a full court meeting and briefed the apex court judges on what transpired in the meeting with the prime minister. It was the second full court meeting of the Supreme Court in as many days.
Though the minutes of the full court meeting were yet to be issued, it is learnt that there was disagreement on the inquiry commission into this matter. Some judges opined that a commission by the federal government would affect the trichotomy of powers and independence of judiciary.
During the first full court meeting on Wednesday, it is further learnt, a few judges called these six IHC judges as heroes. According to an official statement, the full court deliberated on the issues raised in the judges’ letter.
It added that consensus was developed among the members of the full court that in view of the gravity of the situation, the chief justice might hold a meeting with the prime minister on the issues raised in the letter, the statement added.
Chief Justice Isa had received the letter from six IHC judges on March 26. In view of the gravity of the allegations levelled in the letter, he called a meeting on the same day with the chief justice and all the judges of the IHC at his residence and heard their concerns for over two and a half hours.
There is exemplary understanding among the judiciary, executive and superior bars during CJP Isa’s tenure. On Wednesday, he met with the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) representatives. The government functionaries are very relaxed as superior bars led by independent group are unlikely to oppose the formation of the inquiry commission.
However, representatives of the Professional Group are averse to the formation of an inquiry commission by the executive. The group is dominant in the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) and the Balochistan Bar Council (BBC). The Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) also backs the stance of the IHC judges.
PBC member Muneer Kakar, who belongs to the Professional Group, wondered as to how the Supreme Court could endorse the formation of the inquiry commission by the government which was the main beneficiary of political engineering that had been exposed in the judges’ letter.

Kakar expressed the fears that after institutional response by Chief Justice Isa, no judge would dare reveal such incidents next time. Former additional attorney general Waqar Rana also said that a commission by the executive would go against the principle of separation of powers.
He emphasised that it would also go against the principle of natural justice because the executive would practically be the judge in its own cause. “Even, the meeting of the chief justice, along with the senior judge, with the chief executive is unprecedented and likely to undermine the independence of judiciary.”
Interestingly, the term of reference (TORs) of the inquiry commission would be formulated by the executive. There are reports that some judges wanted to take suo motu notice on the letter in order to give institutional response.
Former Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) president Salahuddin Ahmed said that given the gravity of the allegations and the fact that almost all IHC judges had been complaining of interference from intelligence agencies; merely forming a commission of Inquiry was not sufficient.
“It is not only a matter of utmost public importance but also the duty of the Supreme Court to ensure that all judges feel safe in performing their functions independently, and hence it was entirely appropriate for the Supreme Court to take up the matter suo motu,” Ahmed said.
“Given the past history of interference by intelligence agencies in judicial affairs and the complete impunity afforded to them even in cases where such interference has been admitted; expecting a mere commission [even if headed by a retired judge] to be able to do the needful is naive”, he added.
Now that the Supreme Court has agreed to the inquiry commission, there is no chance that judiciary will take up this matter on the judicial side. However some individual judges may give reaction to the commission. Even the six IHC judges could refuse to appear before the commission.
On the other hand, one section of the lawyers is lauding Chief Justice Isa for getting commitment from Prime Minister Shehbaz that he would be taking other appropriate measures to ensure an independent judiciary, including directions to the relevant departments, and initiating legislation in accordance with the Faizabad Dharna judgment in which 17 different directions were passed.
The judgement in 2019, authored by then Justice Isa, had directed that all the intelligence agencies, including the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Intelligence Bureau (IB), the Military Intelligence (MI) and the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) must not exceed their respective mandates.
It said that they could not curtail the freedom of speech and expression and did not have the authority to interfere with broadcast and publications, in the management of broadcasters and publishers and in the distribution of newspapers.
It is also directed that intelligence agencies should monitor activities of all those who threatened the territorial integrity of the country and all those who undermined the security of the people and the state by resorting to or inciting violence.
To best ensure transparency and the rule of law, it stressed, it would be appropriate to enact laws, which clearly stipulate the respective mandates of the intelligence agencies. The Constitution emphatically prohibits members of the armed forces from engaging in any kind of political activity, which includes supporting a political party, faction or individual.
“The government of Pakistan through the Ministry of Defence and the respective chiefs of the army, the navy and the air force are directed to initiate action against the personnel under their command who are found to have violated their oath,” the judgment had said.

1,Up to 20 May 9 accused to be freed from army custody,SC allows military courts verdict announcements in cases of acquittal and lesser punishment," 
The Supreme Court on Thursday amended its stay order to allow military courts to deliver verdicts in cases related to the May 9, 2023, violence involving civilians. This conditional permission applies specifically to cases where the accused were expected to be acquitted or receive lesser sentences.
A larger bench comprising six judges, led by Justice Aminuddin Khan and including Justices Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Shahid Waheed, Musarrat Hilali, and Irfan Saadat Khan, presided over the matter. They emphasized that the release of innocent individuals or those with minor sentences wouldn't impact the case proceedings.
The bench entertained intra-court appeals challenging the apex court's earlier ruling, which deemed the trial of civilians in military courts illegal. Notably, the bench granted permission for the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government to withdraw its intra-court appeal.During the proceedings, the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) informed the bench that around 15 to 20 accused could potentially be released based on acquittal or receiving reduced sentences, following a three-stage process involving conviction, confirmation, and pardon from the competent authority.
The AGP clarified that individuals sentenced to less than one year could benefit from relevant legal provisions, while those facing longer sentences would require relaxation from the competent authority.
Responding to the court's inquiry, the AGP stated that the army currently held custody of 105 accused — two more than the previous count of 103 provided earlier. In response, the bench solicited a comprehensive list of all 105 accused.

Justice Khan indicated the court's willingness to modify the stay order to align with the AGP’s position, allowing potentially released individuals to return home. However, he underscored that this permission remained contingent upon the final decision of the appeals.
During the session, Justice Rizvi sought clarification on which accused might be released. The AGP responded that he couldn't disclose names until the military courts announced their decisions.
Meanwhile, lawyer Faisal Siddiqui, representing a petitioner, urged the court to lift its stay order, arguing that according to the AGP, individuals in military custody couldn't be sentenced to more than three years.
Justice Mazhar countered Siddiqui's argument, highlighting that lifting the stay order would result in cases being transferred to the anti-terrorism court, where convictions under certain sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act could lead to sentences of at least 14 years.
Justice Shahid Waheed clarified that the current proceedings didn't pertain to criminal matters, while Justice Mazhar urged the AGP to expedite releases before Eidul Fitr, to which the AGP agreed.
Siddiqui also objected to the increase in the number of accused and requested assurance from the court that those released from military custody wouldn't be rearrested under the Maintenance of Public Order.
The court instructed that judgments leading to potential releases before Eidul Fitr should be announced and directed the AGP to furnish a list of accused eligible for acquittal. The case was adjourned until the last week of April.

3,PM meets CJ today amid letter controversy,SC holds full-court meeting to discuss IHC judges’ allegations,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will have a rare meeting with Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa today (Thursday) apparently to discuss the startling revelations made by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges about interference of intelligence agencies in judicial matters.
""The PM along with Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar and Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan will meet with the CJ Qazi Faez Isa and Senior Puisne Judge Syed Mansoor Ali Shah tomorrow (Thursday) at 2 pm. Meeting will take place at the SC premises,"" a senior government official told The Express Tribune.
On Wednesday, the SC held a full-court meeting to discuss the contents of the IHC judges’ letter written to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on Tuesday.
Six of the eight IHC judges accused intelligence agencies of using coercive tactics to influence court proceedings.
The judges penned this open letter days after a Supreme Court bench led by Justice Isa set aside an SJC notification that resulted in dismissal of IHC former senior puisne judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui.
Justice Siddiqui in his speech at Rawalpindi bar in July 2018 had also accused an intelligence agency of manipulating IHC proceedings.
A senior lawyer expressed surprise over the CJ meeting with the PM instead of giving an institutional response to the letter.
He also questioned if the senior most judges of the court were holding meetings with the PM after taking into confidence all SC judges.
“CJ Isa should have sought endorsement from all judges before the meeting; otherwise it will not send a good optic for the judiciary as an institution,” he said.
Interestingly, the AGP and the law minister also met with Justice Isa before Wednesday's full-court meeting.
It is learnt that both the officials expressed concern about the timing of the letter, noting that the incidents mentioned in the letter took place last year.
There are reports that the PM will request CJ Isa for conducting an inquiry into the allegations levelled by the six IHC judges as well as former judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui.
Some legal experts believe that Instead of holding a meeting, the PM should have requested the top judge to form an inquiry commission.
They said there is no need for such meetings right now when the country’s largest political party, the PTI, is claiming that they have been a victim of the manipulation of judicial proceedings in the recent past.
Meeting with the head of the executive branch will not send a good message to other superior courts judges who are complaining about interference in their affairs.
A senior lawyer said some superior court judges may strongly react to this meeting
There has been an exemplary relationship between the judiciary and the executive during the term of CJ Isa. The executive authorities are not facing any trouble in any matter.
Abdul Moiz Jafferii advocate said six sitting judges have written to their seniors asking how to complain about what they cannot prove; when it relates to the establishment’s meddling in judicial affairs.
They have then provided details of the incidents that have occurred with each of them, and how they have been failed by their own chief justice, Aamer Farooq.
They have detailed how they brought these to the attention of the former CJ and Justice Isa when he was the senior puisne judge.
Jafferii said this is a desperate measure. It cannot be answered with a commission or a letter.
“Anything less than a suo moto on this issue with the full-court hearing the matter will smell like a cover-up,” he said.
He said the CJ has always remarked how people must bring proof and be specific; otherwise they should not make allegations of such nature.
“He now has as much specificity as is necessary. And six superior court judges [are] willing to submit themselves to an inquiry to back their claims. The claims are simple.
“[They claim] that there is a pervasive and all-encompassing attempt by the intelligence agencies to coerce judges; that such attempts have at times come about to offer support to the side taken by the IHC chief justice and that such attempts have been complained of to both the past and the present CJs.
""I don’t see how this can be brushed under the carpet,"" he added.
Barrister Asad Rahim Khan said this letter has the potential to be a landmark event in our recent history as, according to him, at no point since its restoration has the judiciary been this marginalised.
“The courage of the IHC judges has lent the judiciary an opportunity to reclaim some space back from the deep state, and bring back some credibility to the justice system,"" he added.
Former additional attorney general Tariq Mahmood Khokhar said it is futile to have any recourse to the SJC or the executive.
""They lack competence and therefore are not the appropriate forums. Also, the state is perceived to be the problem in the first place and remains as such.
“Many would see it as another cynical whitewashing performance. It cannot possibly redress judges’ grievances. The solution lies within the superior courts and under the existing law,"" he said.
The role of superior bars will be significant in prevailing situations. Islamabad High Court Bar Association is planning to hold a convention for the support of six IHC judges.
