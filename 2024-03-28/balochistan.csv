0,Rawalpindi cops accused of ‘falsely’ implicating citizen,RPO forms probe body under investigations SSP,"Officials of the Civil Lines and RA Bazaar police have been accused of falsely implicating a citizen a in drug-related case.
Seeking justice, the family members of the victim approached the Rawalpindi Regional Police Officer (RPO) Babar Sarfraz Alpa. The request submitted to the RPO by the complainant contains mind-boggling revelations as well as demands to provide justice by conducting a transparent inquiry.
RPO Babar Sarfraz Alpa has designated SSP Investigation Zunaira Azfar as the inquiry officer and requested a comprehensive report.
The victim stated he resided in the Civil Lines area for 50 years. His son, Asif Khan, is involved in the real estate business. On March 18, Asif Khan was sitting in a vehicle with two companions when law enforcement officers from Civil Lines arrived in two cars and motorcycles. They confiscated their mobile phones, asked for their names, returned the phones to two individuals, and took Asif Khan away in the car.
A labourer, Shiraz, conveyed the information over the phone. ""I called on the 15 and reached the civil line police station while searching."" It has been discovered that ASI Liaquat who had brought Asif Khan and threatened to frame him in the case of possessing five kilos of hashish and send him to jail if he did not pay a bribe of Rs1 million.
He alleged that the SHO was also involved in the crime.
Last year, the RA Bazaar police had picked up Asif Khan. A departmental action was taken against those found to be dishonest during the inquiry.
""I also gave an application to the CPO and the former RPO took action against them. However, got posted in an area of his choice, utilising his connections. The police station's camera footage captured his car parked outside the station at night. It is important to note that the charges are fabricated, he added. Therefore, legal action should be taken against the policemen for misusing power, he said.
Conversely, The Express Tribune reached out to ASI Liaquat Niazi to obtain his stance on the allegations, but Liaquat Niazi affirmed the accuracy of the FIR. The accused's brother is a history-sheeter in gambling cases, whereas, about Asif Khan, he simply stated whether the accused himself ever confessed to the crime.
Despite multiple attempts, Sikandar Nawaz, could not be contacted.

1,Rawalpindi’s clean-up drive falters,Residents highlight the need for more efficient sanitation systems,"The awareness campaign and cleaning operations in all tehsils of Rawalpindi and Murree have miserably failed despite clear directions from the Punjab chief minister. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz earlier ordered to make the entire province clean from garbage under Suthra Punjab.
Millions of tonnes of garbage are piled up in the congested areas of Rawalpindi after a large number of citizens from the surrounding localities of Taxila, Murree, Gujarkhan, Wah Cantt, Rawat and Tarnool arrive in the city every day.
The cleaning exercise by the relevant authorities is only confined to the paperwork. Under the zero-waste policy, civic agencies are supposed to wash garbage from open plots, streets, roads, cemeteries and neighbourhoods with the help of manual and mechanical sweeping methods.
Important roads like Murree Road, Kartapura, Liaquat Bagh, Dhok Khabi, Dhok Kala Khan, Dhok Ratta, Ratta Amaral and Gwalmandi streets portray a dirty picture. According to city dwellers, sanitation staff only cleans the residential areas of legislators and the houses of VIPs.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, citizens Abdullah, Shoaib and Danish said that the Punjab Chief Minister should make the sanitation system in Rawalpindi more efficient and give the latest machinery to the Rawalpindi Waste Management Company (RWMC) in this regard.
They suggested that in consultation with the local traders, the size of shops’ signboards should be uniform and the old buildings should be painted to give the city an attractive look. According to the citizens, old and dilapidated buildings between Shamsabad and Liaqat Bagh on Murree Road present a scene of ruins.
They also put their weight behind the continuation of the RWMC’s door-to-door campaign about the importance and effectiveness of cleanliness throughout the year. Awareness sessions, seminars and walks should be organised and informational pamphlets should be distributed besides awareness messages in mosques.

4,Families reconnect with Adiala inmates,Rawalpindi Central Jail reopens for public meetings after 16-day ban,"The administration of Rawalpindi Central Jail, better known as Adiala jail, on Thursday suddenly lifted the ban on public meetings after 16 days, allowing families and relatives to see inmates and share food and other items in routine.
The visiting branch was opened for visitors who thronged the jail by hundreds. There are 7,840 prisoners in the central jail. Initially imposed due to security concerns, the ban was lifted after 16 days despite being initially intended for 14 days.
Despite the ban, lawyers and families of PTI founder Imran Khan and Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi resumed meetings on the third day as permitted by the Islamabad High Court. However, meetings for families of ordinary prisoners were completely halted and the visiting premises, including the meeting branch, hall, and shed, were sealed off.

The ban triggered a shortage of food, vegetables, fruits, toiletries, tea, cigarettes, and beverages, with fasting prisoners encountering difficulties during iftar and sehri. Inmates kept buying food and items at inflated prices from the jail’s canteen. Due to the absence of meetings, the prisoners also ran out of money for daily expenses, resorting to taking items on credit from the jail canteen.
Despite protests by prisoners in Rawalpindi courts and Bakshi Khanas, the ban remained in place until March 27, prompting a surge of residents to visit their incarcerated loved ones.
Families across the Rawalpindi division are again set to visit Adiala Jail in large numbers today, bringing Eidul Fitr clothes, new shoes, and supplies for iftar and sehri, which will be distributed to the prisoners from Friday onwards.
The jail administration has extended meeting times from 8am to 4pm, with each meeting lasting for 40 minutes and accommodating 150 to 200 visitors at a time.
Daily meetings will be organised in four to five groups, with additional counters set up for Eid and sehri supplies. Except on Sundays, the meetings will be held daily until Eid. Families can provide special food to their loved ones from 11am to 1pm on Eid day, although no meetings will take place on that day.
Citizens Feroze, Ahmed, Rashid and Qayyum, who visited the jail to meet their loved ones, have welcomed the lifting of the ban.
Two weeks ago, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and police on a tip-off foiled an attack near Adiala jail by conducting a joint operation as well as arrested highly-trained terrorists.
The terrorists were planning to target important facilities including Adiala jail. Besides, two threatening calls were made to the official phone numbers of the prison.

5,Huddle discusses issues facing medical students,Pledges to resolve matters related to recognition of their degrees,"World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) President Ricardo León-Bórquez, Federal Secretary Iftikhar Ali Shallwani and Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PM&DC) President Dr Rizwan Taj Thursday discussed the challenges faced by Pakistani medical students studying abroad.
The meeting, which was also attended by PMDC Consultant on International Coordination Farzand, focused on various aspects concerning the quality of medical education, recognition of Pakistani students qualified from foreign medical institutions, and the welfare of Pakistani medical students pursuing education overseas.
During the meeting, Secretary Iftikhar Ali Shallwani and the PM&DC president highlighted the close collaboration between the Ministry of NHSR&C, PM&DC and medical institutions in Pakistan.
He emphasised the importance of such collaboration for meeting the country's medical human resource requirements.
Praising the work of PM&DC, the secretary said that PM&DC was an independent organisation which was working efficiently to address the concerns of medical students and practitioners.
One of the key issues discussed was the recognition of Pakistani students studying in foreign medical institutions, particularly those that are not accredited by recognised accreditation agencies. Secretary Iftikhar Ali Shallwani and President PM&DC expressed concern over the difficulties faced by these students in obtaining recognition for their qualifications upon returning to Pakistan.
He reaffirmed his commitment to ensuring the welfare and recognition of Pakistani medical students studying abroad and vowed to work closely with relevant stakeholders to effectively address the challenges faced by them.
WFME president explained that their organisation's directory of medical institutions currently provides information on the total number of institutions in a country, regardless of recognition status. He said that efforts were underway to enhance the directory by including specific accreditation details of medical institutions from recognised agencies.
Iftikhar Ali Shallwani proposed the establishment of a mechanism for negotiating with foreign countries to encourage the registration of their medical schools under Pakistan's accreditation agency. He suggested setting a timeline for foreign medical institutions that were not recognised by accreditation agencies, after which Pakistani students enrolled in these institutions would not be granted recognition.
All three dignitaries reached a consensus on facilitating direct interaction between PMDC and accreditation agencies of other countries to expedite the resolution of recognition issues and prevent future challenges for Pakistani medical students studying abroad.
