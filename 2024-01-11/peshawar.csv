1,CM orders making children’s hospital operational without delay,"PDA to chalk out plan for early construction of sewerage line; concerned quarters instructed to devise provision of gas, electricity to KICH.","PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa caretaker Chief Minister Justice retired Syed Arshad Hussain Shah has directed the authorities concerned to move a statement of expenditures in the next cabinet meeting for approval to make the Khyber Institute of Child Health (KICH) operational without delay.
Mr Shah issued the directives while chairing a meeting on the project, which was launched in 2013 under the Public Sector Development Programme, a statement issued from the Chief Minister’s Secretariat here on Wednesday said.
The meeting was informed that around 90 per cent of civil work had been completed on the specialised medical facility for children, but the authorities concerned were facing issues in making it operational due to absence of gas and electricity connections and an external sewerage line for waste disposal, the statement said.
Mr Shah ordered the Peshawar Development Authority (PDA) to chalk out a plan for early construction of sewerage line for KICH. He also directed the quarters concerned to devise a plan in coordination with high ups of SNGPL and Peshawar Electric Supply Company for provision of gas and electricity connections to the hospital.
Mr Shah said issue of release of funds for procurement of medical equipment for the hospital would be taken up with the relevant authorities at federal level. He added KICH was of vital importance for the citizens of the province and no further delay would be tolerated in its operationalisation.
The meeting was also informed that besides release of funds for procurement of medical equipment, creation of new posts was also required for making the hospital operational.

4,Notice issued to govt in plea seeking seats in assemblies for transgender persons,Petitioner Sobia Khan has submitted nomination papers for PK-81 as independent candidate.,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court on Wednesday again sought response of federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and Election Commission of Pakistan to a transgender person’s plea for allocation of special seats in National and provincial assemblies for her community.
A bench consisting of Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Syed Arshad Ali again issued notices to governments and ECP after preliminary hearing into the petition of Sobia Khan, a resident of Peshawar.
The petitioner, whose name on her CNIC is Mohammad Bilal, insisted when the high court would order fixing of ‘quota’ in assemblies for transgender persons, her nomination papers recently filed for election to a general seat in Peshawar’s PK-81 constituency should be considered for those reserved seats.
She has made the chief election commissioner, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s provincial election commissioner, returning officer for PK-81 constituency, federal government through attorney general for Pakistan and KP government through its advocate general as respondents to the petition.

Petitioner Sobia Khan has submitted nomination papers for PK-81 as independent candidate

The petitioner also sought an interim relief in the form of orders for the respondents, including the chief election commissioner, to accept her nomination papers for assembly seats to be reserved for transgender persons and not general seats.
Lawyers Sahibzada Riazatul Haq, Mehwish Muhib Kakakhel and Batool Rafaqat appeared for the petitioner and said that during previous hearing on January 4, the court had sought replies of the respondents but so far they had not submitted the same.
They said that their client was born as a transgender person but as there was no separate category for the community in computerised national identity cards, her father got his CNIC made as a man.
They said that the petitioner was a well-educated person with a graduate degree and worked as a social activist, especially campaigning for the welfare of transgender community.
The lawyers said that the petitioner also worked for an online news agency as a journalist and hosted programmes at three FM radio channels and was the first transgender member of a dispute resolution council in the province.
They said that she had submitted nomination papers to contest general elections in PK-81 constituency as an independent candidate eyeing a ‘reserved’ seat.
They said when she approached the relevant returning officer for receiving nomination papers, the latter told her that her nomination papers won’t be accepted for that seat as no ‘quota’ for transgender persons had so far been fixed by the Election Commission of Pakistan.
The lawyers contended when a transgender person had the right to participate in elections as a voter, why the assemblies didn’t have seats reserved for the community.
They wondered as National and provincial assemblies had seats reserved for religious minorities and women, why the legislature didn’t have such representation for the transgender community.
They argued that for safeguarding the rights of transgender persons in the country, it was necessary that transgender persons should have representation in all assemblies and therefore, the court should order the government and ECP to create special seats for them in legislative bodies.

On late Tuesday night, head constable Fayazuddin and constable Sikandar were martyred when police besieged and engaged a militant after an attack on cops guarding a polio team earlier in the day.
The militant was also killed in the fire exchange with the law enforcers.
The bodies of the martyred cops were taken to the police lines for funeral after completing medico-legal formalities in the District Headquarters Hospital.
Among others, divisional commissioner Parweiz Sabatkhel, regional police officer Qasim Ali Khan, district police officer Iftekhar Shah, military and civil authorities and relatives of the deceased attended the funerals.
Police and army officials placed floral wreaths on their coffins, while a police contingent presented a guard of honour to the fallen cops.
On the occasion, RPO Qasim Ali said such cowardly acts could not shatter the strong resolve of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police in their fight against militancy.
He said the supreme sacrifice offered by Fayazuddin and Sikandar would not go in vain, rather it would pave the way for bringing sustainable peace to the region.

6,JUI-F to form next elected govt: leader,Hidayatullah says party nominated candidates for almost all PA seats,"MANSEHRA: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl provincial deputy emir Hidayatullah Shah on Wednesday claimed that his party would win a majority of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly seats in the Feb 8 general elections to install its government in the province.
“We [JUI-F] will emerge as the single largest party in KP elections to form the next government,” Mr Shah told reporters here.
The JUI-F leader said his party had fielded candidates in almost all provincial assembly constituencies.
He said the party’s parliamentary board led by central emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman was not only awarding election tickets to the “strongest” candidates but was also closely monitoring the political situation emerging since electioneering began in the country.

Hidayatullah says party nominated candidates for almost all PA seats

Mr Shah insisted that rival political parties were afraid of the JUI-F’s popularity, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, so they’re carrying out baseless propaganda against it but they would be really disappointed to see election results favour the JUI-F.
He said the JUI-F had fielded candidates in Hazara Division’s seven national and 18 provincial assembly constituencies.
The JUI-F leader said former provincial minister Ibrar Hussain alias Iqbal Tanoli, who recently joined the party, would contest election in PK-39 constituency.
He said though the Pakistan Peoples Party had finalised seat adjustment with the JUI-F in the district, “some minor issues” between the two parties were being sorted out.
Mr Shah said Maulana Mufti Kifayatullah was the party’s “strongest” candidate in NA-15 and the JUI-F was trying to convince the PPP in talks to support Mr Kifayatullah by withdrawing its nominee in the constituency, Zargul Khan.
He said his party would sweep in elections in the national and provincial assembly seats in Kohistan and Torghar districts.
ROBBERS HELD: The Oghi police claimed to have arrested two leaders of an inter-provincial gang of robbers and seized stolen goods.
The arrest of Mohammad Shoaib of Chilas (Gilgit-Baltistan) and Gul Imran of Taxila (Punjab) came during a raid in the area, according to deputy superintendent of police Javed Khan.
“During investigation, we hope to learn about the robberies by the gang in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he told reporters.
Mr Khan said the detainees were wanted by Oghi police in many robbery cases.
He said the police’s search for other members of the gang was under way.

8,Landi Kotal hospital MS post vacant for months,KHYBER: A long delay in the posting of a regular medical superintendent to the district headquarters hospital in...,"KHYBER: A long delay in the posting of a regular medical superintendent to the district headquarters hospital in Landi Kotal here has adversely affected the “health delivery system” at the government facility, insist insiders.
They told Dawn that many doctors and paramedics didn’t come to work on time as the acting MS, who also served as the district health officer, struggled to find “sufficient” time for the hospital to perform additional duties.
“The acting MS either come to the hospital late or sway away for two or three consecutive days due to his other official meetings and obligations badly hitting the hospital’s health services delivery,” a source in the hospital told Dawn.
Sources also claimed that some doctors and clerical staff were working hand in glove to devise “duty rota” of their own choice enabling the “habitual” absentee doctors to focus on their private clinics instead of official duties.
They added that patients were the ultimate sufferers of the situation as a number of surgeries were deferred due to the absence of doctors.
The sources said emergency and labour room services at the hospital were also affected by the “negligence” of doctors and paramedics in the absence of a regular MS.
However, deputy MS Dr Mohammad Khan rejected the assertions and insisted that all departments of the DHQ hospital were functioning properly.
He said the appointment of MS was delayed due to the ban slapped by the Election Commission of Pakistan on postings and transfers in government departments until the holding of the Feb 8 general elections.
Dr Khan said once the electoral process was over, the hospital would get the MS as the directorate of health services had shortlisted names for the post.
The MS’s post fell vacant a few months ago after the transfer of the incumbent, Dr Jamshed Shirani over the allegations by the local doctors and paramedics that he had misappropriated hospital funds and victimised a group of doctors opposed to his policies.
INTERNET OUTAGE: An internet outage has hit the web-based One Custom Clearance of goods at Torkham border crossing for the last few days.
Custom clearing agents and local exporters told Dawn that hundreds of vehicles loaded with export items faced long delays in customs clearance at the border due to the frequent internet disruption.
Customs officials insisted that the technical fault in the custom clearing process would be removed soon.

10,Yak meat floods Chitral bazaars,CHITRAL: Yak meat has flooded the Chitral bazaars as the herdsmen of Broghil valley sell their animals to butchers ...,"CHITRAL: Yak meat has flooded the Chitral bazaars as the herdsmen of Broghil valley sell their animals to butchers to purchase the daily use items before heavy snowfall cuts off the valley from rest of the district for four winter months.
Sher Afgan, a butcher, said every year at the outset of winter season, yaks were brought here in large numbers from Broghil and upper Yarkhoon valleys. He said buying of the animal continued for about a month.
He said people of Chitral awaited the whole year the arrival of yak meat in the bazaars as it was only available in winter months. He added yaks were only raised in Broghil area and the herdsmen brought their animals to the market only days before the harsh winter started.
He said sale of meat increased in winter due to its superb palate and taste characterised by the pastures of the valley where yaks were left to graze freely throughout the year and the intake of a variety of herbs.
“I slaughter more than five animals a day these days due to high demand of the meat,” he said, adding butchers remained busy from dawn to dusk these days.
“People usually purchase more than 20 kilogrammes of yak meat as they send it as gift to their relatives and friends in Peshawar. This is another reason for high demand of meat,” the butcher said.
The price of yak meat has registered a steep rise this year as it is sold at Rs950 a kilogramme as against the Rs600 a kilogramme last season. 
The butchers said the meat price increased as herdsmen had raised the rates of their animals by more than 50 per cent.
A trader, Bashir Hussain, who was purchasing yak meat, said he relished the rich taste of the meat, which needed no salt to be added while cooking.
He said like many people, he purchased sufficient quantity of the meat and consumed it during the winter season, also serving his friends and relatives.
Mr Hussain said though the yak meat fell in the category of beef, it had been declared to be cholesterol-free by dieticians. He said it was totally safe for patients of high blood pressure and sugar.

11,Rejection of pleas against PTI leader’s nomination spices up Haripur election,Yousuf Ayub was disqualified for life in 2013 over degree misdeclaration,"HARIPUR: Rejection of appeals by an election tribunal against the acceptance of nomination papers of senior PTI leader Yousuf Ayub Khan, a candidate for NA-18 and PK-46 seats here, has made things in the run-up to the Feb 8 general elections interesting.
Mr Yousuf was cleared to contest elections by returning officers for the two constituencies after rejecting objections of political rivals to his papers over his Dubai iqama (work permit) and lifetime disqualification under Constitution’s Article 62(1)(f) and the Representation of People Act, 1976.
The decision was upheld by the election appellate tribunalon Tuesday.
Mr Yousuf – the first cousin of PTI general secretary Omar Ayub Khan – made his political debut in 1988 and served as the transport minister in the provincial cabinet led by Chief Minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao from 1988 to 1990 after a group of independent MPAs from Hazara Division and other areas supported the PPP to form the government.
He joined the PML-N in 1993 and won the 1997 election but lost the 2002 election to Qazi Asad. Mr Yousuf acted as the district nazim from 2005 to 2010 and joined the PTI in 2011.

Yousuf Ayub was disqualified for life in 2013 over degree misdeclaration

He won the 2013 election as a PTI’s nominee and became the minister for communication and works in CM Pervez Khattak’s cabinet but was unseated and disqualified for life in Sept 2013 over misdeclaration of his educational qualification under Constitution’s Article 62(1)(f) and Section 99 of the Ropa, 1976.
Lawyers for Mr Yousuf insist that his disqualification was for five years under Section 100 of the Ropa but the point was overlooked by his legal advisers in the past making him wait for around a decade to become eligible for any public office.
“The disqualification period of five years is clearly mentioned in Section 100 of the Ropa, so the apex court’s verdict in the Nawaz Sharif disqualification case has no domino effect in Mr Yousuf’s punishment that should have been over in 2018,” insisted lawyer Haq Nawaz Safdar, who challenged objections to the PTI leader’s nomination papers before the election tribunal of Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Observers claim that despite disqualification, Mr Yousuf stayed in contact with voters and not only carried out election campaigns of his brothers Arshad Ayub and Akbar Ayub and cousin Omar Ayub in 2018 but also enjoyed their powers as the “de facto minister” and issued directions to government departments about development schemes and even for the hiring and firing of officials.
Surprisingly, the plaques of scores of development projects installed on Haripur streets carried the name of Mr Yousuf along with those of his cousin as the federal minister and brothers Arshad and Akbar as ministers in CM Mahmood Khan’s cabinet.
Family insiders and party sources told Dawn that Mr Yousuf’s papers were filed just as the covering candidate for cousin Omar and brother Akbar Ayub - PTI candidates – as both were skeptical about the chances of getting a go-ahead for contesting elections in light of criminal cases and disqualification of other party leaders and nominees in the country.
Mr Omar will face Babar Nawaz of the PML-N in NA-18 election, while Mr Akbar is testing his luck to make a hat trick as MPAs from PK-46 against an independent candidate and former two times MPA and education minister, Qazi Mohammad Asad Khan.
It is not clear yet if Mr Yousuf will be able to convince his cousin, Omar Ayub, or his younger brother, Akbar Ayub, to leave an assembly seat for him this time around, the returning officer and tribunal’s decisions of clearing election path for him has turned electoral scene in Haripur incredibly interesting, according to observers.

He was addressing a public meeting in Sangota wherein Pakistan Peoples Party leader Sultan Gujjar along with his supporters and senior vice president of Awami National Party for Shangla district Shamsur Rahman joined PML-N along with hundreds of other people.
Mr Muqam said that PML-N would come to power with the help of voters to resolve the issues of the area and remove sense of deprivation among its people. He added that there was no need for making false and empty promises.
“We have already taken the country out of the quagmire of problems. Now under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif, PML-N will drive the country out of the existing issues,” he said. He said that their opponents showed poor performance during their rules and could not compete with PML-N.
“We have entered the field to end price hikes, inflation, poverty, unemployment and lawlessness,” said Mr Muqam. He said that PML-N would bring economic and political stability to the country by forming a government in provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and in centre after the upcoming elections.
He said that PML-N workers should launch a door-to-door campaign to convey the message of Nawaz Sharif to people. He said that PML-N was not responsible for price hike and inflation but those, who made anti-people agreements with International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“Everyone knows that under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif Pakistan got rid of IMF in 2016,” said Mr Muqam. He added that it was agenda of his party to steer the country out of difficulties.
He said that on May 9, an anti-state group attacked Pakistan and state institutions. “The same group has ruled Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for nine years and bankrupted the province. The infrastructure of the province, including health and education, has been destroyed,” he alleged.
The PML-N leader said that people would reject Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf as they had come to know its reality.
The new entrants to PML-N also addressed the gathering. They showed complete confidence in the party and its provincial president.

16,Laiqzada Laiq: the poet of our times,"MY father’s telephonic discourses with Laiqzada Laiq Sahib, delving deep into literary ideas and initiatives for...","


 
MY father’s telephonic discourses with Laiqzada Laiq Sahib, delving deep into literary ideas and initiatives for advancing Pashto culture and literature are unfading memories of my early youth. I never then had a chance to meet him in person, and knew him solely through the anecdotes shared by my late father. At that time, he served as the director of Radio Pakistan, Muzaffarabad AJK.  
My personal interest in Pashto literature led me to some of his poetic masterpieces. I perceived him as a romantic poet like Shelly and Keats, crafting impressions without succumbing to verbosity. On a few occasions, I had the privilege of conversing with him over the telephone, and developing profound respect for him as a gentleman and a distinguished literary figure of our generation.
The turning point came on my father’s passing away in September 2015, when I met Laiqzada Sahib for the first time in my village, Rajjar Charsadda. He spoke at length about my late father’s contributions. Laiq Sahib exuded the confidence of mature intellect and appeared to be a man of few words, possessing a charisma.
Until then, my connection with Pashto literature was primarily as my father’s driver, chauffeuring him to such events. However, opting Pashto as an optional subject in the CSS examination unveiled a whole new realm of expression and emotions.
After the passing away of my father, Professor Jehanzeb Niaz, we as a family, decided to pay tribute to him through a free medical camp. Eventually, we came to a decision that the best way to pay tribute would be to organize some literary event. In this regard, the first person who came to my mind was Laiqzada Laiq.  
He encouraged me to carry forward the unfinished agenda of Professor Sahib. We decided to contact some of his old colleagues and friends. That is how I came across Faridoon, Nadan, Aseer Mangal, Dr. Alam, Khadim and so many others.
In 2019, Laiq Sahib proposed the establishment of a literary institution “Niaz Adabi Sangar (NAS)”, dedicated to the advancement of Pashto literature. Within a mere three-year span, the organization etched a distinctive presence as a patron for meritorious poets within literary circles under the chairmanship of Laiq Sahib.
We had not even imagined that our journey towards the achievements of our objectives would be so short. We were together on September 30th, 2023 in Niaz House Charsadda for a meeting. On 8th October, 2023, I received a call from his son Wajid Laiq that Laiq Sahib was admitted to Hayatabad Medical Complex. The doctors did their utmost but he could not survive and passed away on 30th October, 2023, leaving a vacuum which is nigh on impossible to fill.
Laiq Sahib was a poet par excellence. He uses simple language and candid expression, but could create magic out of it. I would always call him in his presence as the representative poet of the present generation and he would simply smile without further commenting on the observation. Beyond the realm of romantic ghazals, he delved into the contemporary societal landscape, through his nazms.  
Another facet of his poetry unveiled a profound love for the Holy Prophet (PBUH), as is evident in his numerous works of naats, for which he received the prestigious National Seerat Award. He extensive research and penning books on drama, short stories, and essays added to his literary legacy. Esteemed Pashto singers, including Fiaz Khan Kheshgi, Haroon Badsha, Shakeela Naaz, Fazal-i-Wahab Dard, and Wajid Laiq, transformed his poetic gems into mesmerising melodies.
Honoured with the Tamgha-i-Imtiaz, Laiq Sahib stood as a stalwart supporter of artists and musicians, extending personal support where needed. His written work, encapsulated in the English-translated tome “An artist never dies,” further attests his dedication to the arts.
The passing of Laiq Sahib signifies not just a monumental loss for Pashto literature and culture, but a profound personal void for me. As my mentor, teacher, friend, confidant, co-worker, and adviser, he embodied a beacon of hope for me.  
Our relationship, inherited from my father, was cherished, and the absence of Laiq Sahib in NAS meetings and activities is deeply felt. May his soul find eternal peace, and may we find the strength to carry forward the missions of Professor Jehanzeb Niaz and Laiq Sahib.
