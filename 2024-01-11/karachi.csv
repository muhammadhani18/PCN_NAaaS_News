KBA president Amir Nawaz Waraich said that the whereabouts of the senior lawyer were not known since his alleged abduction by police.

1,80 more vehicles added to city’s Peoples Bus Service fleet,"Caretaker CM Baqar says Karachi should have at least 15,000 buses.","KARACHI: In an effort to keep the beleaguered public transport system in the city afloat, the caretaker provincial government on Wednesday inducted 80 more buses — 30 diesel hybrid and 50 electric — to the fleet of the Peoples Bus Service (PBS), increasing the number to 300, including 19 women-only buses.
Though the addition of 80 more buses is fractional in the city that requires over 15,000 public buses, the commuters will heave a sigh of relief as the PBS buses operating on 11 routes in Karachi provide a standardised transport to a sizeable number of citizens.
The stunning shortfall of the public buses has already left the majority of people in the city with limited options, mainly auto-rickshaws and motorcycle riders, for their daily commutes out of sheer necessity.
The 80 buses — 30 hybrid and 50 electric — were added to the PBS fleet by caretaker Chief Minister retired Justice Maqbool in a simple ceremony held at Mazar-i-Quaid.

Caretaker CM Baqar says Karachi should have at least 15,000 buses

Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, caretaker Information Minister Ahmad Shah and other members of the Sindh cabinet also attended the inauguration ceremony.
The CM cut the ribbon to inaugurate 30 hybrid and 50 electric buses. He along with other officials travelled on one of the buses for a brief journey.
Speaking on the occasion, the CM said as of mid-2015, there were 3.6 million registered vehicles in the city, which was over 30 per cent of the national total. He added that the growth rate for private vehicles was over four per cent, which meant that there were now over 1,000 new vehicles being added to the streets of the city each day.
He pointed out that until 2017 there were more than 12,000 public vehicles, including buses, minibuses and coaches, operating on 267 routes in the city. “However, the number of buses has been declining steadily, and as of 2017, less than 5,000 buses were serving fewer than 100 routes.”
He emphasised that a city as big as Karachi should have at least 15,000 modern buses.
The chief minister said that owing to the lack of intra-city public transport, the provincial government and the National Radio and Telecommunication Corporation (NRTC) signed an agreement in October 2021 for the supply, operation, and construction of the Sindh Intra-District Peoples Bus Service Project.
“It is a government-to-government (G2G) initiative launched in June 2022. It is the first-ever intra-city public transport project operating in mixed traffic, especially in Karachi and other cities of Sindh, such as Larkana, Hyderabad, and Sukkur.
“The project is designed to integrate state-of-the-art bus operations model consisting of high-quality diesel hybrid bus service to meet the increasing urban transport demand in metropolitan cities and contribute to the development of a sustainable transport system,” he added.
Briefing the CM, Transport Secretary Asad Zamin said that currently, 204 Buses were in operation on 11 routes in Karachi.
He said six buses were operating in Larkana, 12 in Hyderabad on two routes, and 10 in Sukkur.
He said that the first women-only Pink Buses project was already operating in the city. 
50 electric buses
The CM was informed that the Telephone Industry of Pakistan (TIP), a subsidiary of the NRTC, was engaged in a flagship project with the Sindh government. It has submitted a proposal through its international partners to develop an eco-friendly ‘electric vehicle system’ in the province. 
The initiative is on a ‘Rent to Own’ model under which the Sindh government would pay nominal lease payments, including the operational and capital costs, for eight years. After completion of the lease period the buses would be handed over to the provincial government.
The caretaker CM acknowledged that the proposal had been negotiated with sound terms and due diligence. 
Justice Baqar directed the transport department to work out a robust contractual framework with the TIP to ensure maximum performance for public benefit. 
He emphasised that the key performance indicators (KPIs) should ensure proper maintenance of buses throughout the eight years of the buyback period.
The caretaker cabinet had approved a pilot project comprising 50 environment-friendly pure electric buses to fulfil the previous commitments to formalise the contractual arrangements.

2,Four ECP officials die in their sleep from gas leakage,SUKKUR: Four employees of the Election Commission of Pakistan died in their sleep from inhaling gas which was...,"SUKKUR: Four employees of the Election Commission of Pakistan died in their sleep from inhaling gas which was probably leaking at an election office in Kandhkot district complex early on Wednesday morning.
Sources said the election staff were working late and fell asleep in their chairs where they were found dead by police in the morning. 
Police officials and Rescue 1122 shifted the bodies to the Civil Hospital for a post-mortem examination after they were informed of the incident, they said.
According to a press release issued by the ECP, the dead were identified as election officer Mushtaq Ahmed Magsi, 50; data entry operators Ghulam Fareed, 32, and Majid Hussain Khaldi, 40, and an office assistant aged 25.
After preliminary investigation, the police said it appeared that the victims had tightly closed all the doors and windows of the office to save themselves from severe cold and dense fog and left no opening for ventilation. They died most probably from the gas leakage in the office room, they said.
They said that they had started investigation into the incident but they would have to wait for the final report of post-mortem examination to determine the actual cause of the deaths. 
The post-mortem reports would be released within a week, said Deputy Commissioner Amir Owais.
Sources said that autopsies had been conducted on three bodies while relatives of the fourth victim did not allow doctors to conduct medico-legal formalities. 
The bodies were handed over to the heirs after completion of medico-legal procedures, they said. 
The ECP press release said that Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja and members of the commission had expressed deep sorrow and grief over the tragic death of four colleagues and ordered inquiry into the incident. Provincial Election Commissioner of Sindh Sharifullah also expressed grief over the incident.

4,"20 missing children raped, murdered across country in 2023, report reveals","Out of total 2,633 missing kids, 1,942 reunited with families; Sindh tops in cases of missing children.","KARACHI: Some 20 children, who had gone missing from their homes, were sexually abused and then killed during the year 2023 across the country, data released by a non-profit organisation said on Wednesday.
According to Roshni Helpline’s annual report, a total of 2,633 cases of missing children were reported in the country from January to December 2023, and 1,942 of them were successfully recovered and united with their parents.
The report said that bodies of 33 children were recovered during the last year and 20 of them were sexually abused and murdered. Seven bodies were recovered from manholes and drains, while five children died in accidents. “Twenty-three kidnapped children were successfully recovered,” it added.

Out of total 2,633 missing kids, 1,942 reunited with families; Sindh tops in cases of missing children

However, the organisation, which focused on tracking record of missing children and coordinating with authorities for their safe recovery, added that more than 600 children were still missing and efforts were underway for their recovery.
It said that Sindh reported 1,543 cases of missing children followed by Punjab with 805 cases, Islamabad with 125 cases, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 113, Balochistan 35, Azad Kashmir 11 and Gilgit-Baltistan reported only one case.
The gender-wise data shows that 2,140 of the reported missing children are boys, while 493 are girls. The age-wise brackets reveal that 354 cases involve newborns to children under five, while 596 cases involve those aged between six and 10 years. 
A total of 1,299 cases include those aged between 11 and 15 years and 384 cases involve those aged between 16 and 17 years.
“The reported cases highlight a notable and major concern regarding the increase in the number of children running away from home, particularly among those aged 11 to 15 years,” the report said, adding: “The rise is attributed to parents’ lack of understanding of their children’s psyche, leading them to adopt violent methods.”
“This finding suggests a concerning trend where the use of violent methods by parents may contribute to an increased incidence of children leaving their homes, and this issue has escalated from 2022 to 2023,” the report said.
Additionally, it said, that an alarming increase in runaway cases among children above 10 years old is ascribed to communication gap between parents and children and the imposition of societal pressure and decisions upon them.
Some cases revealed that children left their home due to poverty, psychological issues within family, parent’s neglect and domestic issues, including parental abuse, parents not being able to fulfil their small wishes and various other reasons.

5,SHC dismisses pleas against candidature of three PTI men,Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Alamgir Khan also allowed to contest polls on NA seat.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Wednesday allowed a candidate of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) to contest the Feb 8 general elections from a Karachi National Assembly seat and also dismissed petition filed against the candidatures of three other party leaders.
PTI’s Alamgir Khan had filed nomination papers from NA-236 (East-II), but the returning officer (RO) dismissed his papers and an election tribunal upheld the decision of the RO.
The SHC also dismissed petitions filed against the candidature of three other aspirants of the PTI from NA-241 (Karachi South-III), including party’s Karachi president Khurram Sher Zaman, President Arif Alvi’s son Awab Alvi, and Muzammil Aslam.
Alamgir Khan had filed a constitutional petition in the SHC against the order of the election tribunal and cited the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), tribunal, RO, Federal Board of Revenue and others as respondents.

Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Alamgir Khan also allowed to contest polls on NA seat

Representing the petitioner, Advocate Haider Waheed and Asad Ashfaq Tola argued that the RO dismissed the candidature on Dec 27 without jurisdiction and on Jan 5, the tribunal also dismissed their client’s election appeal.
They stated that the impugned orders of the tribunal and the RO were liable to be set aside as they failed to consider the currently applicable law.
The counsel contended that the petitioner was left uninformed till Dec 30 when the RO publicly disclosed the list of the accepted candidates, revealing the rejection of the petitioner’s nomination.
They argued that the tribunal had misunderstood the petitioner’s political ordeal and abstained from acquiring documents from the FBR. Some vague and blanket clearance from the FBR was not a requirement to run for the elections, they added.
The lawyers submitted that the role of the FBR in election related cases was pivotal, but there was no legal requirement for the issuance of a no-objection certificate (NOC) from them and this could not be used as a valid ground without any reasoning or explanation for rejecting the petitioner’s nomination papers. The law officers of the ECP and other respondents supported the order of the tribunal. 
After hearing the parties concerned, a two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi set aside the order of the tribunal and allowed the petitioner to participate in the polls. The bench in its order said: “For the reasons to be recorded later on, the impugned order is set aside and the instant petition is allowed.” 
The same bench on Wednesday also dismissed three identical petitions filed against the orders of tribunals allowing three other PTI’s aspirant to run in the elections.
Dost Mohammad had filed the petitions against the candidature of the three PTI candidate, adking the SHC not to allow them to take part in the election. 
When the bench inquired about the petitioner, his lawyer contended that he was a patriotic citizen and trying to prevent “corrupt people from participating in the elections”.
Initially, the RO had rejected nominations papers of the PTI candidates from the same constituency on several grounds, including non-disclosure of assets and criminal cases as well as alleged misuse of the office of the president of Pakistan. 
However, the election tribunals had allowed their appeals and allowed them to contest the forthcoming general elections.
Meanwhile, an election tribunal on Wednesday disposed of an appeal filed against the candidature of former provincial minister Sharjeel Memon of the Pakistan Peoples Party after the appellant had withdrawn the same. 
Anwar Ali had filed an appeal against the decision of RO for accepting the nomination papers of Mr Memon from PS-61 (Hyderabad-II).
The appellant contended that the PPP candidate did not mention proper value of vehicles and gold in his possession in the nomination papers and also submitted a fake affidavit along with the papers.

KARACHI: It was an unusual press briefing on Wednesday evening at the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) to announce a forthcoming production Kavad Katha to be staged from Friday (tomorrow) to Sunday (Jan 14) because instead of the usual setting where artists or directors engage with the journalists, a piece from the play directed by Rao Jamal Singh Rajput was performed for a very low number of media persons. It was done in Haryanvi, Sindhi and Urdu languages, respectively, by Rajput, Zubair Baloch and Hasnain Falak. 
After the performance, Mr Rajput answered the questions put to him. He said the word ‘kavad’ is derived from the word ‘kivaad’ meaning door. “[In the production] there are many doors. As the story progresses, the doors open. The form of storytelling originated in Rajasthan. Around 400 years ago, it stopped from being performed. Gradually it resumed but even today only two communities do it in India. What happens [in preproduction] is that first the doors are made with wood, then they’re painted and finally a storyteller known as kavadiya tells the tale.” 
He said three stories are going to be told from Friday. First belongs to Haryana. “Although I have written it, it belongs to the oral storytelling tradition (seena ba seena). The story travelled from Rajasthan to Haryana, and when members of the Haryanvi community migrated to Pakistan, it came along with them. I had heard the story from my elders.” 
Mr Rajput said the second tale is Karanjhor Jo Qaidi in the Sindhi language written by Ali Baba. It’s about those who had fought against the East India Company. “The reason for doing it is to go back to our roots.” 
He said the third story in Urdu focuses on Mirabai. “We had kept it a bit musical with dohas in it. It’s about Mira and Krishna’s love.” 
The director said that the play is going to be narrated by the above-mentioned three artists in a dastangoi fashion. 
He thanked Napa for providing its students with the opportunities to do new things.

Additionally, he said, the Sindh government had planted one million mangrove plants in the sea.
Mangroves are a natural infrastructure that helps protect nearby populated areas by reducing sea erosion and absorbing storm surge impacts during extreme weather events such as hurricanes. They are also important to the ecosystem due to their dense roots, which help bind and build soils.
Answering another question, the CM said his government had initiated several schemes to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
During a presentation to the staff course, IG Police Riffat Mukhtar told the participants that there were four major heads of crime in the katcha area such as kidnapping for ransom through honey-trapping and forced kidnapping, highway robberies, tribal feuds and smuggling.

Rizvi said during his speeches at gatherings of party workers and supporters in Nawabshah and Tando Adam on Wednesday that elected representatives expended their terms in visiting Bilawal House and Jati Umra while poor public groaned under prohibitively inflated bills of electricity and gas.
He said that people should ask their leaders as to what had they done for them during the past 40 years of their rule.
He slammed Pakistan Democratic Movement that the alliance of 13 parties led by “thieves” only devalued rupee and contributed to inflation. What those who claimed to bring change did in their tenure, he asked.
He said the country was going through a political crisis. “We have issued a 25-point manifesto and will contest election on the basis of their manifesto,” he said.
About Israeli attacks on Gazza, Rizvi said that rulers of 57 Muslim countries were petrified as occupation forces butcher innocent children in Palestine. Brave Palestinians were safeguarding the third holiest site of Islam singlehandedly without any help from any Muslim country, he said.
He said that Kashmir and Palestine were looking towards TLP and urged people to vote for his party to give it an opportunity to serve them.
