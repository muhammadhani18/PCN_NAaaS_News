On the directions of PFA Director General Muhammad Asim Javaid, dairy safety teams inspected milk-carrying vehicles, dairy units and milk shops to ensure the provision of pure and fresh milk to consumers. DG PFA said that teams placed screening pickets at three different points of Lahore including Babu Sabu, Saggiyan Bridge and Ravi Toll Plaza on Wednesday.

The authority inspected over 50 milk-carrying vehicles loaded with a total of over 41,000 litres of milk. He added that teams took action against milk suppliers and discarded over 1,900 litres of milk after screening test results were not up to the mark. The samples of discarded milk contained polluted water, a low level of fats and a lack of nutritional value in the milk. 
DG Muhammad Asim said that indiscriminate action would continue until the elimination of the milk-adulteration mafia across Punjab. He added that citizens could get milk tested free of cost by visiting the nearest PFA office with a sample of 200ml of raw milk.

4,Prep classes in schools suspended for a week,Pneumonia risk mars reopening after winter break,"Due to the extreme cold weather in Punjab, the provincial government has extended by a week the winter vacations for playgroup to Class I in the schools because of harsh weather and health risks.
However, the schools will remain open for the higher classes in accordance with a new timetable issued by the authorities. On the other hand, on the first day after the winter vacations, low attendance of the students was recorded due to the cold weather. A large number of children were reportedly suffering from diseases caused by the cold weather.
The extreme cold weather and proliferation of diseases, including pneumonia, fever, flu and chest infection among young students forced the Punjab government to extend for seven more days the winter holidays for the pre-class to Cass I students in the public and private sector schools. 
The decision was taken after the first day following the reopening of schools, in view of reports regarding health risks to young children due to the harsh cold weather conditions and low attendance in the classes. The schools across Punjab opened on Wednesday after three-week winter vacations. 
According to Punjab Teachers Union Secretary General Rana Liaqat Ali, around 40 per cent students were absent on first day of school after the vacations. 
Health experts say lack of rainfall has turned the weather harsh with a spike in diseases caused by smog and fog. Several big cities of the province are experiencing a long spell of fog. 
Citing inadequate infrastructure, school administrators had been asking the Punjab government to take steps to provide facilities to protect the children from the cold weather.
""Attendance was low in the schools and the teachers also faced difficulties in continuing the classes for little kids in the prevailing conditions. We have no facilities of heating in the classrooms and the reason is simply lack of funds,” Rana Liaqat said while speaking to The Express Tribune.
He urged the government to release funds to the schools to purchase heaters and also make adequate arrangements in the rural areas.
“We also don not have the facilities for taking care of students feeling unwell and it would be better for them to stay home,” he added.
The parents also faced hardship in dropping their children at schools in the morning, especially in the remote districts.
""Thousands of students go to schools on local buses, while a majority of them travel on motorbikes. In this cold season the critical issue is the lack of facilities in the government schools,” said a schoolteacher in Narowal district, Qamer Khan.
Meanwhile, Caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi said while speaking to the media that a ban had also been imposed on morning assemblies throughout the ongoing month.
He said there was an alarming situation at the Children's Hospital, where a number of kids had succumbed to pneumonia since January 1. 
Naqvi likened the spread of pneumonia to the coronavirus and urged parents to be vigilant about their children's diet and health. He announced an imminent awareness campaign against pneumonia. 
Highlighting the severity of the cold weather, he urged the elderly citizens to prioritise their diet and attire. 
Mask-wearing was declared mandatory in schools and specific guidelines issued to combat the disease. 
He assured the public that the health and school departments were diligently addressing the situation, with daily feedback from a committee.

7,Inadequate correctional facilities plague jails,Released inmates struggle to reintegrate into communities,"For jailed convicts accustomed to a life of crime and deviance, reintegrating into a decorous society is a task requiring stupendous perseverance, even more so for inmates serving sentences in Punjab’s jails, who in the absence of behavior correction programs, leave prison cells only to return to their earlier offensives with reinvigorated resilience.
Where nations across the globe heavily invest in the education and instruction of prisoners serving terms inside jails in an attempt to prepare them for a new life of propriety and dignity after their release, inmates within Punjab’s largest jail network facing a variety of charges are denied basic didactic coaching and skills training, leading human behavior experts to deduce that the life of freedom awaiting most outcasts beyond the threshold of the jail premises would be far more unforgiving than their time behind bars.
“Until or unless the prisoners in jails are given adequate counselling and training, they can never lead normal lives after their release. But unfortunately, no such coaching system exists in the jails of Punjab for prisoners who are denied a chance at becoming better citizens. Therefore, in most cases, these prisoners return to their criminal activities soon after leaving jail,” expressed Dr Shahzad Tahir, a Professor of Psychology, who advised the government to introduce reform houses within jails, which conduct weekly lectures for inculcating moral values among inmates. 
According to sources obtained by The Express Tribune, a negligible number of correctional facilities exist across 43 jails in Punjab which despite holding more than 55,000 prisoners including 52,000 men, 1,000 women, 700 children, 3,800 accused, 1,400 convicts and more than 400 death row prisoners, have only 32 teachers available for giving basic ethical instruction to prisoners or their children.
Moreover, the nugatory didactic and vocational training that prisoners receive in these jails is either funded by a private non-governmental organization (NGO), a company or a welfare organization. This is evident in the fact that ever since Masjid/Maktab schools were closed in jails, the only kind of coaching available to inmates was technical and was offered by companies like Toyota however, the efficacy of such schemes was dubious in nature.

Unsurprisingly, even when some religious and ethical training was given in jails, a shortage of teachers prevented any serious improvements in the intellectual and social development of inmates since 40 per cent of the posts for Arabic, ethics and psychology teachers were reportedly vacant.
“The scope of our work is limited, therefore, we only offer coaching to children and young girls in the hopes of improving their future prospects,” said Syeda Farah Hashmi, a teacher working at a jail.
Given the dire absence of teaching facilities in jails, some prisoners who aspire to achieve erudition study on their own and complete their intermediate, bachelor’s or master’s degrees through the Allama Iqbal Open University.
“The sentence of any prisoner who receives worldly or religious education is waived by 15 days to two years,” informed Inspector General Prisons Punjab Mian Farooq Nazir. 
Speaking to The Express Tribune on the matter, Special Secretary Home Department Fazalur Rehman said, “Many NGOs in jails are running schools offering courses of matriculation, intermediate, bachelors, masters and Quranic education. We plan to introduce a correctional facility in jails soon.”
