0,Afghan women detained over ‘improper’ hijab,"“They were arrested to inform their families that their sister, daughter or wife roams without hijab and they should prevent this,” says Ehsanullah Saqib.","KABUL: A Taliban official has said several girls and women were detained recently in Kabul for not covering themselves properly, after reports circulated of a crackdown in the Afghan capital.
In a video posted on on Wednesday, security official  Ehsanullah Saqib told a gathering of religious scholars in Kabul’s western Dasht-e-Barchi neighbourhood that in the past week  “we have detained a number of women and girls who were without hijab, with the help of women police”.
Women have been squeezed from public life, barred from travelling without a male relative and ordered to cover everything but their hands and eyes when outside the home, though many women still go out in Kabul without covering their mouths.
Ehsanullah, addressing the gathering on Tuesday according to the video posted on X by Khaama Press and Amu TV, said the women and girls were detained because they were  “totally without hijab”, wearing trousers or leggings and dresses, instead of a garment that loosely covers the whole body.
“They were arrested to inform their families that their sister, daughter or wife roams without hijab and they should prevent this,” he said.
Abdul Ghafar Sabawoon, spokesman for the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue, said the women had  “only been advised by female police to have greater respect and dignity (in observing hijab)”.
“No woman has been disrespected or humiliated, nor do we have anyone in the custody in connection to this.”

Hebestreit confirmed a report by the German weekly Spiegel, which said that Berlin had given the green light for the export of 150 Iris-T air-to-air missiles to Saudi Arabia.
“The details of this report are accurate,” said Hebestreit, speaking at a regular government news conference. The newly approved Iris-T missiles could  “be fired from aircraft at airborne targets, that is to say missiles, drones and so on”, Hebestreit added.
Approval for the export of the missiles, manufactured by German group Diehl Defence, was granted towards the end of last year, Spiegel reported.

2,"Five killed in US storms, country girds for more",WASHINGTON: Swaths of the United States braced for more snow and punishingly low temperatures on Wednesday as...,"WASHINGTON: Swaths of the United States braced for more snow and punishingly low temperatures on Wednesday as millions in the east dug out from a previous round of severe winter weather that left at least five people dead.
The latest storm, already bringing precipitation to the West, was expected to tear across the country this week, bringing an Arctic blast to northern regions and prompting weather advisories or warnings in dozens of states from California to Maine.
“A potent Arctic front drops southward from Canada on Wednesday and this will herald the arrival of the coldest temperatures so far this season for the Northern Plains, with subzero lows becoming a reality for Montana and the Dakotas, and highs remaining below freezing as far south as Oklahoma by Friday,” the National Weather Service (NWS) said in a statement.
That comes on top of fierce storms that brought tornadoes in the South, dangerous flooding in the east and blizzards through the Great Lakes region and elsewhere, disrupting thousands of commercial flights and prompting governors to declare states of emergency.
The NWS forecast  “several feet of heavy snow and strong winds gusting to 60 mph” (96 kilometres per hour) through Wednesday in the northwest’s Cascades and parts of the Rocky Mountains, with the storm then barrelling eastward and bringing  “blizzard conditions” to the Midwest.
Meanwhile, tornadoes on Tuesday ripped through the Florida panhandle, where drone images showed downed trees and damaged buildings with roofs torn off. At least five storm-related deaths have been recorded, including an 81-year-old Alabama woman whose mobile home was reportedly struck by a tornado.

3,Boeing CEO admits error as planes remain grounded,"Incident that befell Alaska Airlines plane a ‘quality control issue’, staff told.","WASHINGTON: Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun acknowledged errors by the US planemaker, telling staff the company would ensure an accident like the mid-air Alaska Airlines panel blowout  “can never happen again”, as more than 170 jets remained grounded for a fourth day.
The company’s top planemaking official, Stan Deal, also told a somber town hall meeting at its 737 factory that Boeing acknowledges  “the real seriousness of the accident” as it launches checks into its quality controls and processes.
Calhoun’s remarks were Boeing’s first public acknowledgment of errors since a so-called door plug snapped off the fuselage of a nearly full 737 MAX 9 on Friday, leaving a gaping hole next to a miraculously empty seat.
Calhoun said he had been  “shaken to the bone” by the accident, which rekindled pressure on Boeing over its troubled small plane family almost five years after a full-blown MAX safety crisis sparked by deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.

Incident that befell Alaska Airlines plane a ‘quality control issue’, staff told 

“We’re going to approach this, number one, acknowledging our mistake,” Calhoun told employees, according to an excerpt released by Boeing. 
“We’re going to approach it with 100pc and complete transparency every step of the way.”  Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, the two US carriers that use the temporarily grounded planes, have found loose parts on similar aircraft, raising fears such an incident could have happened again.
‘Quality control issue’
In a separate meeting on Tuesday, Boeing told staff the findings were being treated as a  “quality control issue” and checks were under way at Boeing and fuselage supplier Spirit Aerosystems, sources familiar with the matter said.
Boeing has sent written orders to its own plants and those of its suppliers to ensure such problems are addressed and to carry out broader checks of systems and processes, they said.
Boeing shares fell 1.4% on Tuesday as United canceled 225 daily flights, or 8% of its total, while Alaska Airlines canceled 109, or 18%. Similar cancellations were expected on Wednesday.
Calhoun also told Boeing employees the company would  “ensure every next airplane that moves into the sky is in fact safe.”  He praised the Alaska Airlines crew that swiftly landed the plane, with only minor injuries to the 171 passengers and six crew.
Calhoun, who was a Boeing board member when all MAX jets were grounded in 2019, also praised Alaska Airlines for quickly grounding its 737 MAX 9 jets, adding he knew  “how hard it is to ground planes, much less the fleet,” the sources said.
Some industry leaders have privately criticised Boeing for not grounding planes faster on Saturday. People familiar with the matter say it had been drawing up plans to order inspections when the Federal Aviation Admin­istration (FAA) intervened with an emergency order to ground 171 planes.
Boeing voiced support for the FAA’s action, and the company’s contrite tone on Tuesday contrasted with statements that were criticized as legalistic after the 2018 crash of a Lion Air 737 MAX in Indonesia.

Saturday’s election is being closely watched – including by policymakers in Beijing and Washington – as its outcome will impact the future of Taiwan’s relations with an increasingly assertive China.
At the talks, held at the Pentagon on Monday and Tuesday, Chinese officials demanded that Washington “stop arming Taiwan, and oppose Taiwan’s ‘independence’”, according to a Chinese defence ministry readout.
According to the Pentagon’s readout, the US reaffirmed its calls for “peace and stability” across the Taiwan Strait.
The two sides also discussed the crucial waterway, where the two powers last week held rival drills, and which has seen a spate of standoffs between Beijing and Manila in recent months. 
According to the readout from Beijing, the Chinese officials urged their US counterparts to stop their “provocative actions” in the waterway.
Washington, in response, asserted its belief in the “importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation” in light of “repeated” Chinese “harassment against lawfully operating Philippine vessels in the South China Sea”.
The US side also stressed the importance of “maintaining open lines of military-to-military communication”, according to the Pentagon’s readout, “to prevent competition from veering into conflict”.

5,High tech glove helps woman fight Parkinson’s disease tremors,LAS VEGAS: Roberta Wilson-Garrett looked at the glove keeping her right hand steady and smiled. At bay for the ...,"LAS VEGAS: Roberta Wilson-Garrett looked at the glove keeping her right hand steady and smiled. At bay for the moment were tremors caused by Parkinson’s disease affecting her muscle control.
She could do things others take for granted, like write crisply with a pen or hold a cup of coffee without spilling.
The reprieve shared by the Canadian woman at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas came thanks to a GyroGlove. “It’s a life changer for me,” said Wilson-Garrett, describing how GyroGlove stopped tremors that make seemingly simple tasks like getting dressed a challenge.
GyroGear has built the world’s most advanced hand stabiliser, with strategic partners that include Chinese technology group Foxconn, according to founder Dr Faii Ong.
The key to GyroGlove is an attached gyroscope about the size of a hockey puck but with a disk inside that spins faster than a jet engine turbine, according to Ong. “That glove is made in the same factory that makes your MacBook Pros,” Ong said, referring to Foxconn being a supplier for Silicon Valley superstar Apple. The plan is to miniaturise the gyroscope with future iterations of the glove.
“We want to bring the focus away from the disease and back onto the fact that this is human life we are talking about,” Ong said. “That is what tech should do; it’s more important to focus back on ourselves as people and to understand how we can actually make people’s lives better.” 
Gadget guide dog 
Massachusetts-based GyroGear was one of an array of companies at CES seeking to use tech to improve life for people with infirmities or disabilities Startups like Glidance and stalwarts like Amazon were among companies packed into a section of the Venetian hotel and casino displaying technology meant to improve life for people with disabilities.
Glidance founder Amos Miller, who lost his vision early in life, demonstrated a compact, two-wheeled device that acts as a guide dog of sorts for walkers who can’t see. Glide can be given a destination and lead the way for someone holding its handle, or be easily pushed along sensing obstacles and steering users along safe routes.
“You simply walk, and the wheels will steer,” Miller said as he demonstrated the device. “I can tell it where to go if I want, but it will resist me bumping into anything.” The Seattle-based startup plans to launch a beta program for Glide later this year and make it as easy to afford as a smartphone.
Another Seattle startup called OneCourt has created what looks like a toy sized replica of an American football field which converts real-time updates from a sports match into vibrations.
Visually impaired sports fans can place a hand on the faux field to feel action playing out in a game. The device can work with a gamut of sports including tennis, hockey, and American football.
“We’re excited to be making live sports more accessible to people with visual disabilities,” said OneCourt chief executive Jerred Mace. “Basically, trying to get people closer to the action.” Vibrations on the device provide a sense of factors such as how fast a ball or puck is moving, where players are on a field and how they are maneuvering.

KATHMANDU: Nepal police said on Wednesday they had arrested a spiritual leader whose followers believe him to be a reincarnation of Buddha over allegations of disappearances and rape at his ashrams.
Ram Bahadur Bomjan, known as  “Buddha Boy” among devotees, became famous as a teenager after followers said he could meditate motionless for months without water, food or sleep.
The 33-year-old guru has a devout following but has long been accused of physically and sexually assaulting his followers, and had been hiding from authorities for several years. “He was arrested after absconding for several years,” police spokesman Kuber Kadayat said.
Police apprehended Bomjan in Kathmandu on a warrant issued for his alleged rape of a minor at an ashram in Sarlahi, a district south of the capital. They said he was caught with bundles of cash amounting to 30 million Nepali rupees and another $22,500 in foreign currency.
Accusations of abuse and misconduct against Bomjan stretch back more than a decade. Dozens of assault complaints were filed against Bomjan in 2010. He said he beat the victims because they disturbed his meditation. An 18-year-old nun accused the guru of raping her at a monastery in 2018.
Police opened another investigation against him the following year after family members reported the disappearance of four of his devotees from one of his ashrams.

7,Pakistan backs ICJ move against Tel Aviv,UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has endorsed South Africa’s initiative to persuade the Inter­national Court of Justice...,"UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has endorsed South Africa’s initiative to persuade the Inter­national Court of Justice (ICJ) to declare Israeli actions in Gaza and the West Bank as a genocidal war.
Pakistan’s UN mission said in a statement issued on Wednesday that Pakistan “eagerly anticipates” the ICJ’s “advisory opinion” regarding the legal implications of Israel’s policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.
On Tuesday, Pakistan shared its opinion on this issue during a UN General Assembly debate in New York on the use of veto by the United States on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian Question.
“Israel’s war in Gaza is brutal—a veritable genocide,” said the country’s UN envoy Usman Jadoon while addressing the session. “Israel’s indiscriminate slaughter of innocent Palestinians, including children and women, is a flagrant violation of international laws and the UN Charter.”
“Pakistan welcomes South Africa’s initiative to bring Israel’s transgressions under the Genocide Convention to the ICJ,” Jadoon said. Urging the international community to act now, Jadoon stated, “This genocidal war must be stopped forthwith in accordance with the UNGA’s resounding call for an immediate and unconditional humanitarian ceasefire.”
On Oct 27, 2023, the General Assembly passed a resolution calling for a humanitarian truce in Gaza with 121 votes for, 14 against, and 44 abstentions. On Dec 22, the UN Security Council also passed a resolution to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza.
Jadoon highlighted that Israel has been constantly violating both resolutions by continuing its military offensive and refusing to allow a regular flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza.

8,WHO cancels sixth aid mission to Gaza over security concerns,"WHO says only 15 hospitals in Gaza remain functional, even partially.","LONDON: The World Health Organisation (WHO) cancelled another planned medical aid mission to Gaza on Wednesday over security concerns, the sixth such cancellation in two weeks, and sounded a fresh alarm over the spread of infectious disease there.
The UN body’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said it was the sixth mission to northern Gaza cancelled by the UN agency because requests to visit had not been approved or assurances over security provided since its last visit, on Dec 26.
“Intense bombardment, restrictions on movement, fuel shortage and interrupted communications make it impossible for WHO and our partners to reach those in need,” he told a virtual press conference from Geneva.  “We call on Israel to approve requests by WHO and other partners to deliver humanitarian aid.”  
The WHO said only 15 hospitals in Gaza remain functional, even partially. The deteriorating conditions are also a perfect breeding ground for infectious disease, the agency said. 
For example, the number of diarrhoea cases among children under five was 20 times higher in November  2023 compared to the average of the previous year, said Richard Peeperkorn, WHO representative in Gaza.
He added that he was hopeful a WHO mission planned for Thursday to northern Gaza could go ahead. But he added that 16 or 17 of 21 planned missions from the wider UN have already been cancelled so far this month.
Mike Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies director, said it would be a “gargantuan” task to restore the public health system in Gaza even with a ceasefire.

9,"Abbas agrees to reunite West Bank, Gaza: Blinken",Says Abbas is committed to reforming the Palestinian Authority.,"• Top US envoy meets PA chief in Ramallah
• Egypt, Jordan warn Israel against reoccupation of Gaza, call for return of displaced families
• Sisi seeks ‘decisive stance’ by world community for ceasefire
MANAMA: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas was committed to reforming the Palestinian Authority in a way that could “reunite” Gaza and the occupied West Bank under its leadership.
In a related development, Egypt and Jordan warned against any Israeli reoccupation in the Gaza Strip Blinken was speaking to reporters in Bahrain after meeting with Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah during a tour of the Middle East aimed at preventing an escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict.
“We talked […] about the importance of reforming the Palestinian Authority, policy and governance so that it can effectively take responsibility for Gaza… so that Gaza and the West Bank can be reunited under a Palestinian leadership,” he said.
“It’s very clear to me for president Abbas that he’s prepared to move forward and engage in all of these efforts.”
Blinken said Abbas was committed to reforming the Palestinian Authority.
“What I take away from this meeting is that he is committed to that and is very much prepared to move forward,” Blinken told AFP in response to a question about Abbas’s commitment to reforming the PA.
Egypt and Jordan while warning against any Israeli reoccupation in the Gaza Strip appealed for the uprooted residents to be allowed to return to their homes as the Arab countries’ leaders met Abbas.
While Israel presses forward with a military campaign it says will last for months, Abbas, Jordan’s King Abdullah, and Egypt’s Abdel Fattah al-Sisi also restated their rejection of any plans to displace Palestinians from their lands — a risk Egypt says has grown as Israel’s war against Hamas has driven most Gaza residents southward towards the Egyptian border.
Jordan has been concerned by increased instability and attacks on Palestinians by Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, with which it shares a border.
The international community needed to show a “decisive stance” to push for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, a statement issued by Sisi’s office said.
The three leaders confirmed “a complete rejection of any attempt to reoccupy parts of Gaza, and the need to enable its people to return to their homes”, the statement added.
Ahead of their summit at Aqaba in Jordan, Abbas met Blinken.
“The Arabs are telling the Americans the priority now is to get a ceasefire and push Israel to allow Palestinians to go back to northern Gaza, and ease the overcrowding near (the southern town of) Rafah, which is alarming both the Egyptians and the Jordanians,” a Jordanian official said.
The Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank and held talks with Israel on a Palestinian state before they collapsed in 2014. Hamas has ruled in Gaza since 2007 and is sworn to Israel’s destruction.
Talks on prisoners
Egypt, along with Qatar, has separately been trying to mediate between Israel and Hamas to negotiate a new ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli prisoners that Hamas captured in its surprise Oct 7 incursion into Israel.
That mediation has resumed following a pause after the killing last week of Hamas deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut, and an Israeli delegation visited Egypt on Tuesday to discuss the possibility of a long-term ceasefire in return for the freeing of prisoners, two Egyptian security sources said.
Israel has killed more than 23,000 Palestinians in Gaza since launching its campaign to destroy Hamas, after its fighters killed 1,200 Israelis and took 240 prisoners in a cross-border rampage on Oct 7 that triggered the war.

The bombings have deprived thousands of Palestinian children of one or both parents.
She and her four-year-old brother Khaled roll around on the floor of the shanty they now live in amid a tent city of homeless people, facing up to a life with no father as their mother struggles to cope in the rubble of a ruined enclave.
“The house collapsed on us and Daddy went to heaven and he is very happy,” said Khaled, bouncing up and down on Laila’s lap as they sat.
Three months of bombardment have been devastating for the children of Gaza. Health authorities in the Hamas-run territory have estimated that about 40 per cent of those confirmed killed, a figure they now put at 23,357, were aged under 18.
Most of those who survive have lost their homes. They live in shelters in schools, in tents or shanties, or crammed into still-standing houses, whole families living in single rooms. With very little food in Gaza, children are always hungry.
“We are still unable to count the numbers, but we have initial estimates of thousands of orphans. The figures are high and the challenges are big,” said Ahmed Majdalani, the Palestinian Social Development Minister in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Laila has an ungainly metal brace attached to her injured leg and scars on her face and foot. The children play among the lines of laundry strung between tents on the sand of Rafah.
The hardship — and fear in a conflict where intense Israeli bombing of civilian areas continues — is made worse by their sadness.

11,Camera footage shows vehicles driving over Palestinian killed in Israeli attack,JERUSALEM: Camera footage recorded outside a house in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarm showed Israeli forces...,"JERUSALEM: Camera footage recorded outside a house in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarm showed Israeli forces vehicles repeatedly running over the body of a Palestinian man shot during an attack.
The Israeli border police said a vehicle had run over the body unintentionally after it came to extricate Israeli forces, which it said had come under heavy fire, adding that the incident was under review.
The footage emerged after the border police said on Monday its commandos had entered Tulkarm to arrest a “wanted militant” and had killed three Palestinians in a clash.
It showed Israeli forces approaching a house at night and opening fire on a group of men, at least one of them armed, after they rushed out of the house into the street.
Two of the men were hit in the street and lay still, while footage taken from another angle shows a third man shot.
The footage showed an Israeli vehicle coming up to two bodies on the ground and driving over one of them, at one point coming to a stop on the man’s legs.
Images apparently recorded later show one body having apparently been moved to the side of the road while another vehicle backs over the other body and then manoeuvres over it twice more.
Footage from a different camera at the same scene, apparently taken moments earlier, showed several Palestinians running from the house, with one handing a rifle to another, who was immediately shot. The footage shows the two men in the street from a different angle as well as the third man, lying in the driveway of the house.
The Palestinian ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement condemning the incident, which it said reflected a “culture of hatred and extremism”.
The Tulkarm Brigades, an armed group linked to Fatah, which leads the internationally-recognised Palestinian Authority, claimed one of the Palestinians killed on Monday as its member.
Tulkarm, location of one of the main crossing points between the occupied West Bank and Israel, has seen repeated attacks by Israeli forces since the Oct 7 Hamas raid in Israel.
