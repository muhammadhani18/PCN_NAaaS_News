• Mahrang Baloch says she’s not going anywhere, reaches out to UN for protesters’ protection
• UN special rapporteur urges authorities to drop criminal complaints against marchers
ISLAMABAD/QUETTA: Caretaker Balochistan Information Minister Jan Achakzai claimed on Wednesday that the leaders of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) were using the issue of missing persons to tarnish Pakistan’s image at the international level and for seeking asylum for themselves abroad.
Dr Mahrang Baloch, who is leading the Islamabad sit-in against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Balochistan, responded to Mr Achakzai’s allegations, stating the provincial government was running a prolonged propaganda campaign against BYC leaders.
Speaking at a press conference in Quetta on Wednesday, Mr Achakzai said a report had been submitted to the Supreme Court which had exposed the ‘propaganda’ of the BYC.
“[BYC leader] Dr Mahrang Baloch wants to become Malala Yousafzai Part 2,” he said.
 






Referring to the report submitted to the SC, the minister said that out of total 10,078 registered cases, 7,781 have been resolved and only 2,297 remained unresolved, of which 1,477 cases are related to kidnapping, ransom, runaways and family disputes.
“As of now, only 820 people are missing,” he claimed, adding that terrorist organisations registered their recruits as missing persons, who were later found dead in police encounters and suicide bombings.
Character assassination
However, Dr Mahrang vehemently rejected the allegations made by Mr Achakzai.
Talking to Dawn, she said the BYC would continue to report the injustices against their people to the United Nations, and slammed the government for not taking their issues seriously.
“All they want is [carry out the] character assassination of the victims and their families,” she said during a separate interview with Geo News.
“I am not leaving Pakistan. I am sitting here in Islamabad and I will be here until our grievances are heard,” she said, adding that their demands are not unconstitutional by any means.
“Since Nov 23, more than 40 of our supporters have gone missing, even today 15 people were picked in Taunsa, Punjab, only for holding a gathering in support of our cause,” she said, adding that around 200 FIRs were lodged against their supporters in various parts of the country.
“The worst part is that cases have been registered against 260 students by Islamabad police when we arrived here on December 20,” she said, adding that BYC leaders have communicated to the UN body that registering of cases against students was nothing less than a crime since it puts their careers at stake.
UN virtual meeting
Additionally, Mary Lawlor, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, held a virtual meeting with leaders of the BYC on Wednesday.
Ms Lawlor raised concerns about police harassment and complaints against the marchers later through a tweet on her X (formerly Twitter) account.
 






“Spurious criminal complaints against peaceful protesters should be dropped,” she wrote.
Earlier, Dr Mahrang held a news conference where she answered why BYC chose to approach the UN instead of Pakistani authorities
“The Supreme Court is here, parliament is here close to this camp - no one has come to us nor called us so where should we go now,” she said, adding that the protesters were under a threat by all state beneficiaries.
Meanwhile, participants at the Baloch Shuhada Forum (BSF) camp conducted a media talk, accusing foreign entities of supporting the BYC. They alleged that BYC leaders defended terror groups.

1,Soldiers on the streets as Ecuador declares war on cartels,Gunmen who took over TV studio captured; gangsters threaten to execute civilians.,"QUITO: Hundreds of soldiers patrolled near-deserted streets in Ecuador’s capital Wednesday after the government and drug mafias declared war on each other, leaving residents gripped with fear.
On Tuesday, officials said another narco boss — Los Lobos leader Fabricio Colon Pico — also escaped since his arrest last Friday for alleged involvement in a plot to assassinate Ecuador’s attorney general.
Ecuador President Daniel Noboa said on Wednesday that his country was “at war” with drug gangs who are holding more than 130 prison guards and other staff hostage and who briefly captured a TV station live on air and set off explosions in a surge of violence that has left city streets deserted.



 
The small South American country has been plunged into crisis after years of growing control by transnational cartels who use its ports to ship cocaine to the US and Europe.

Gunmen who took over TV studio captured; gangsters threaten to execute civilians

President Daniel Noboa, 36, gave orders on Tuesday to “neutralise” the criminal gangs after gunmen stormed and opened fire in a TV studio and bandits threatened random executions of civilians and security forces.

 





 
At least 10 people have been killed in a series of attacks blamed on gangs - eight in Guayaquil, and two “viciously murdered by armed criminals” in the nearby town of Nobol, police said Tuesday.
Riots erupted in several prisons, where more than a hundred guards and administrative staff are being held hostage, the SNAI prisons authority said.
“There is fear, you need to be careful, looking here and there, if you take this bus, what will happen,” a 68-year-old woman told AFP in Quito, on condition of anonymity and describing herself as “terrified.”
In the port city of Guayaquil, attackers wearing balaclavas and firing shots stormed a state-owned TV station on Tuesday, briefly taking several journalists and staff members hostage in dramatic scenes broadcast live before police arrived.
Gangsters also kidnapped several police officers, one of whom was forced at gunpoint to read a statement addressed to Noboa.
“You declared a state of emergency. We declare police, civilians and soldiers to be the spoils of war,” the visibly terrified officer read. The statement added that anyone found on the street after 11:00 pm “will be executed.”
Much of the violence has concentrated in prisons, where clashes between inmates have left more than 460 dead, many beheaded or burnt alive, since February 2021. The country’s murder rate quadrupled from 2018 to 2022 and a record 220 tons of drugs were seized last year.
Noboa said he is targeting 22 criminal groups, the most powerful of which are Los Choneros, Los Lobos, and Tiguerones.
Los Chonero’s leader, Jose Adolfo Macias, aka “Fito”, had been leading the criminal enterprise from his jail cell in Guayaquil for the past 12 years until his escape, announced Monday.
‘Attack on democracy’
The explosion in violence has sparked alarm abroad.

 





 
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described the gang activity as a “direct attack on democracy and the rule of law”.

 





 
Brian Nichols, the top US diplomat for Latin America, said Washington was “extremely concerned” by the violence and kidnappings, and pledged to provide assistance and to “remain in close contact” with Noboa’s team.
Peru put its border with Ecuador under a state of emergency.
China’s embassy and consulates in Ecuador announced on Wednesday that services to the public were suspended.
France and Russia both advised their citizens against travel to Ecuador.
Geography and corruption are among the reasons that the once peaceful country has evolved into a hotspot of transnational organized crime.
Ecuador borders the world’s two largest cocaine producers, Colombia and Peru.
Guayaquil port, from where most of the drugs are shipped abroad -- often in containers of bananas or in legal shipments by front companies — is seen as having weaker controls.
This has drawn in foreign mafia from Colombia, Mexico and Europe, allied with local gangs who fight brutal wars for control of lucrative drug routes.

2,Bilawal shares his economic plan with businessmen,"Promises revamp of tax collection method, Charter of Economy.","LAHORE: After the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, the Pakistan Peoples Party also sees Charter of Economy vital for stabilising the financial system of the country as PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari shares his economic plan with the business community of Punjab.
Talking to members of the United Business Group at the residence of former Lahore Chamber president Shahzad Ali Malik here on Wednesday, he said that it was the PPP that had taken the initiative of signing the Charter of Democracy (CoD) and it would also initiate the process for signing the Charter of Economy after coming to power.
 






Sharing his economic vision with the business leaders, he said if voted to power the PPP would revamp the tax system and introduce a ‘participatory’ approach in which the federating units would be empowered to collect taxes instead of the federal authorities.
He elaborated that the federation would give a tax collection target to the federating units, which would be free to keep with them the amount collected over and above the target and contribute from their own resources if they failed to meet the target.

Promises revamp of tax collection method, Charter of Economy

“There will be no forced (tax) collection. The mechanism will be based on mutual (taxpayers and tax collectors) understanding.”
He promised that the PPP government would take all chambers on board before finalising every budget.
 






Responding to a query by FPCCI Punjab chapter vice-chairman Zaki Aijaz Qureshi about privatisation of state-owned entities, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said he didn’t think that any political government could privatise state institutions. He said the PPP would rather involve the private sector through a public-private partnership system for running the state-owned institutions operating in losses.
Answering a question about the need for a strong foreign policy, the former foreign minister said for this purpose “our own house must be in order” first as all friendly countries he visited during his 16-month stint as foreign minister desired political stability in Pakistan to enable them to come forward to help Islamabad (financially).
About the higher cost of energy, he said as long-term agreements had been signed with the independent power producers (IPPs) and no government could back out from them but alternative energy and green energy projects would be launched to arrest the rising electricity tariffs.
He said the PPP government would also focus on establishing special economic zones to facilitate the local investors for setting up industrial units.
Meanwhile, speaking at a workers’ convention, the PPP chairman questioned the absence of the PML-N from electioneering though the general elections were less than a month away.
 






He said whether the N-League wished it or not, the elections would be held in time.
He said the polls were scheduled for Feb 8 and the PPP had entered the arena, but he could not see the PML-N (candidate) against the claims that the latter holds sway in the constituency.
He asked the audience if they knew who the PML-N candidate was in the National Assembly’s constituency NA-127 (the seat Mr Bhutto-Zardari is also in the run for) and added that the PTI was also missing from the scene in the constituency.

3,Minister rules out postponement of polls on security concerns,Murtaza Solangi says caretaker govt has nothing to do with election delay resolution passed by Senate.,"ISLAMABAD: Caretaker Information Minister Murtaza Solangi on Wednesday ruled out the postponement of general elections scheduled for Feb 8 on the pretext of law and order situation.
“The law and order situation during general elections in 2008 and 2013 was worse than the present situation, but the polls were held,” he told reporters after meeting Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) member from Sindh, Nisar Ahmed Durrani, who heads the bench that charge-sheeted PTI founding chairman Imran Khan in the Toshakhana case.
Addressing a question about a resolution passed by the quorum-less Senate seeking the postponement of elections due to security concerns and inclement weather conditions, Mr Solangi said the House had the right to pass a resolution.
 
 

When asked if he discussed the resolution, which was sent to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, with the caretaker prime minister, he said the caretaker government had nothing to do with it.

Responding to a question about lacklustre electioneering, he said that the electoral campaign will gain momentum after announcement of the final list of contesting candidates. He said all political parties were about to start their campaigns and the activity will gain more momentum in the days to come. The PML-N has scheduled a rally for Jan 15, he added.
Regarding internet outage on the days PTI announced online events, Mr Solangi said that these technical problems had occurred in the past as well. “The reasons were technical and had nothing to do with politics,” he claimed, and advised reporters to contact the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) for more details.
He also advised the media to contact the Foreign Office and the ECP to get details about foreign observers coming to Pakistan to monitor elections.
 






In response to a question about the purpose of his visit to the commission, mere hours after the Peshawar High Court restored the election symbol of PTI, he stated that he had been in touch with the Election Commission since the first meeting of the caretaker cabinet and this visit was a part of these contacts.

4,"Disinformation may undermine new govts’ legitimacy, warns World Economic Forum",Global Risks Report says perceptions of reality likely to become even more polarised.,"ISLAMABAD: Risk specialists predicted that extreme weather and misinformation were likely to trigger a global crisis in the next couple of years, according to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Risks Report 2024, released on Wednesday.
The report warned that the widespread use of misinformation and disinformation, and tools to disseminate it, may undermine the legitimacy of newly elected governments in countries that are heading to polls in the coming years, including Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the UK and US.
 






The report, released ahead of the upcoming gathering of political and business personalities from around the world, also cautioned that foreign and domestic actors alike will leverage misinformation and disinformation to further widen societal and political divides, which would emerge as the most severe global risk over the next couple of years.
 
 

Beyond elections, perceptions of reality are likely to also become more polarised, infiltrating the public discourse on issues ranging from public health to social justice. However, as truth is undermined, the risk of domestic propaganda and censorship will also rise in turn.

Global Risks Report says perceptions of reality likely to become even more polarised

In response to mis- and disinformation, governments could be increasingly empowered to control information based on what they determine to be “true”. Freedoms relating to the internet, press and access to wider sources of information that are already in decline risk descending into broader repression of information flows across a wider set of countries, the WEF report says.
“An unstable global order characterised by polarising narratives and insecurity, the worsening impacts of extreme weather and economic uncertainty are causing accelerating risks - including misinformation and disinformation - to propagate,” said Saadia Zahidi, Managing Director of World Economic Forum.
“World leaders must come together to address short-term crises as well as lay the groundwork for a more resilient, sustainable, inclusive future,” she said.
The report paints a predominantly negative outlook for the world over the next two years that is expected to worsen over the next decade.
 
 

The outlook is markedly more negative over the 10-year time horizon, with nearly two-thirds of respondents of the survey carried out by WEF, expecting a stormy or turbulent outlook.
The report, produced in partnership with Zurich Insurance Group and Marsh McLennan, draws on the views of over 1,400 global risks experts, policy-makers and industry leaders surveyed in September 2023.
The report hoped that the next decade will usher in a period of significant change, stretching the adaptive capacity to the limit. A multiplicity of entirely different futures is conceivable over this time frame, and a more positive path can be shaped through our actions to address global risks today.
Societal polarisation features among the top three risks over both the current and two-year time horizons, ranking number nine over the longer term. In addition, societal polarisation and economic downturn are seen as the most interconnected – and therefore influential – risks in the global risks network, as drivers and possible consequences of numerous risks.
The cost-of-living crisis remains a major concern in the outlook for 2024. The economic risks of inflation and economic downturn are also notable new entrants to the top 10 risk rankings over the two-year period.
Although a “softer landing” appears to be prevailing for now, the near-term outlook remains highly uncertain. There are multiple sources of continued supply-side price pressures looming over the next two years, from El Nino conditions to the potential escalation of live conflicts.
Economic uncertainty will weigh heavily across most markets, but capital will be the costliest for the most vulnerable countries. Climate-vulnerable or conflict-prone countries stand to be increasingly locked out of much-needed digital and physical infrastructure, trade and green investments and related economic opportunities.
Similarly, the convergence of technological advances and geopolitical dynamics will likely create a new set of winners and losers across advanced and developing economies alike. If commercial incentives and geopolitical imperatives, rather than public interest, remain the primary drivers of the development of artificial intelligence and other frontier technologies, the digital gap between high- and low-income countries will drive a stark disparity in the distribution of related benefits - and risks.
Vulnerable countries and communities would be left further behind, digitally isolated from turbocharged AI breakthroughs impacting economic productivity, finance, climate, education and healthcare, as well as related job creation.
