The tribunal found no evidence of such activities within the university premises, nor any systematic racketeer group involved in these activities.
Furthermore, the tribunal has termed police negligence and YouTubers responsible for the scandal that maligned the university, its teachers and students.
 
 

It also fixed the responsibility, naming police officials, a private person and a journalist, for involvement in maligning the IUB.

LHC tribunal recommends case against police officials, vlogers for defaming university

The Punjab caretaker government had written to the LHC chief justice to constitute a one-member tribunal to inquire into the allegations of drug abuse and sexual harassment of girl students at IUB.
On Aug 24, Governor Balighur Rehman appointed Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar of the Lahore High Court as tribunal to probe the ‘scandal’.
The tribunal was directed to ensure a thorough probe into the allegations, ascertaining facts and causes and strict action against the people involved.
 
 

The tribunal report, available with Dawn, stated that the police mishandled the situation without any concrete evidence or conclusive proof of sexual harassment or drug abuse on the university premises. This mishandling has been identified as a major factor in defaming and maligning the university.
The report also criticised social media personnel for airing unconfirmed and unauthentic involvement of female students or faculty members of IUB in sexual harassment or drug abuse. This action not only defamed and maligned the university but also put at stake the dignity and honour of female students and faculty members.
The tribunal fixed the responsibility on several individuals, including Bahawalpur District Police Officer (DPO) Syed Muhammad Abbas, Bahawalpur Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) DSP Jamshed, Derawar Station House Office (Sub Inspector) Ramzan and a private person Abdullah known as a police tout.
The tribunal recommended registration of a criminal case against the police officials involved in tarnishing the image of the university.
Furthermore, the tribunal also held television presenter and YouTuber Iqrarul Hassan Syed and Lodhran YouTuber/vlogger Saqib Mushtaq responsible for airing the vlogs without verification.
Earlier, the Bahawalpur police had arrested IUB Treasurer Prof Dr Abubakar, Chief Security Officer (CSO) Ijaz Husain Shah, and Transport Officer Altaf for possessing drugs and objectionable videos and images of girl students and staff members. However, the tribunal’s findings contradict these initial police investigations.
The tribunal’s report has brought a significant turn in the scandal that rocked the university.

The decision came after the caretaker provincial cabinet granted approval to various interventions on the recommendations of the standing committee on legislative business and privatization, with certain amendments made to the Punjab prisons rules.

According to the notification, the caretaker government has also established District Prisons Health Councils (DPHC) on the pattern of the already working health councils for the district headquarters (DHQ) hospitals of Punjab.
“The DPHCs shall be constituted in every district to administer the health-related affairs of the prisoners in jails”, reads the notification.
Each council shall consist of the deputy commissioner concerned, who would act as chairman, while the chief executive officer (of the District Health Authority) would be its vice chairman.

6,Breakthrough for PML-N as Marala group joins party,Ex-MNA Rehman Naseer says he had ended his 22-year-long affiliation with the PLM-Q's Chaudhrys during previous polls.,"GUJRAT: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz on Wednesday achieved a breakthrough in NA 62 (Sara-i-Alamgir- Kharian-Kotla) as the Marala group of former MNA Rehman Naseer and his brother Irfan Naseer, a former Kharian Naib Tehsil Nazim of the PML-Q, joined the PML-N.
The announcement was made at a meeting with former prime minister and PML-N president Mian Shahbaz Sharif in Lahore.
Those who joined the party along with Mr Naseer, include his uncle Dr Shaukat Marala, Chaudhary Saqib Basheer, a former chairman of the Kharian municipal committee.
Mr Sharif welcomed the new entrants into the party folds.
Talking to Dawn, Rehman Naseer confirmed his group’s joining the PML-N and said that he had unconditionally joined the party after consultation with members of family and political group in NA-62. He also announced to support ex MNA Abid Raza Kotla and other candidates of the PML-N in the region.
Mr Naseer was elected MNA on the ticket of Pakistan People’s Party in 2002 but soon after the elections he joined the PML-Q and then contested next three general elections (2008, 2012 bypoll and 2013) as a Q nominee but lost at the hands of PML-N nominees. He did not contest the 2018 polls due to a seat adjustment between the PTI and PML-Q.
 
 

Responding to a question, he said he had ended his 22 years long affiliation with the Chaudhrys after former federal minister Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain launched his son Musa Elahi as a candidate from his constituency (NA-62) without considering his services and sacrifices for the party in the region.
Rehman Naseer Marala is a grandson of former PPP senator Chaudhry Rehamdad, the younger brother of former president of Pakistan Fazal Elahi Chaudhry.
Earlier, a female member of the Marala family, Tashfeen Safdar Marala, former PTI MNA on reserved seats, quit the PTI and joined the PML-Q a few days ago. It is learnt the PML-Q has nominated her for a reserved seat for women in Punjab Assembly in the Feb 8 elections.

Abdullah, son of a senior PTI leader, Chaudhry Mumtaz Akhtar Kahlon, had allegedly gone missing from Islamabad airport on his return from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.
A petition was filed before the Islamabad High Court chief justice for Kahlon’s recovery and the court ordered police to trace his whereabouts after checking the CCTV record of the airport and submit a report. However, before submission of the report by the authorities concerned, a video clip was uploaded on social media in which Abdullah Kahlon said he was with his ‘friends’. He also announced withdrawal of his candidature for the PA seat, and parting of ways with the PTI in the video clip.
Kahlon distanced himself from the events of May 9, condemned the episode and said those responsible for it should be punished.
Earlier, a case was registered against Abdullah Kahlon with Sajid Shaheed police station on charges of shouting slogans against sensitive institutions and leading a mob which blocked a road and damaged the state property. He had left the country to avoid his arrest in the case.
Later, he got protective bail from the IHC and returned to the country, but disappeared from Islamabad airport. He was reportedly coming to Sargodha to run his election campaign.
Kahlon’s mother Zahida Parveen is also a candidate from NA-84 (Sargodha).
The  nomination papers of Abdullah Kahlon for the NA and PA seats from Sargodh city were rejected by the returning officer. However, the papers of his mother for NA-48 were accepted. Observers of local politics say that the appearance of Kahlon’s video would damage the election campaign of his mother and dishearten party workers in the  constituency.
