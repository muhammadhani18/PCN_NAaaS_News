ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary body on Wednesday took up the prevailing issue of smog, especially in Lahore, which was having serious repercussions on citizens’ health.
A meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change was presided over by chairperson Senator Seemee Ezdi who emphasised the challenges posed by fog in urban areas.
Officials from the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination provided the committee members with a comprehensive briefing on various aspects of fog, including its formation, types, frequency in winter and the related issue of smog.

Senator Farooq Hamid Naek explained that while fog was a natural phenomenon, human activities contributed to the formation of smog. He stressed the need to implement measures to combat smog, particularly in areas like Lahore.

Human activity contributed to formation of smog, says senator

The ministry clarified that both carbon-intensive industries and general pollution contributed to smog. It was conveyed that 45pc of smog was attributed to vehicle emissions.
In discussions about the way forward, the ministry emphasised key factors, such as enhancing fuel quality, implementing mandatory annual certification for vehicles, promoting clean energy and sustainable transportation, adopting cleaner agricultural practices, improving waste management, raising public awareness and education and implementing urban forestation.
Additionally, the ministry suggested installing smog towers as a potential solution, citing their successful installation in China and ongoing efforts in India.
The ministry affirmed that Living Indus had been selected from among 150 applications for the World Restoration Flagship of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, and this achievement was commended by the committee members.
 
 

Furthermore, the ministry also briefed the committee on the Living Indus initiative, emphasising its aim to restore the ecological health of the Indus basin within Pakistan.
They highlighted extensive consultations with the public sector, private sector, experts and civil society, resulting in a comprehensive list of 25 preliminary interventions.
These interventions focused on water and flood management, resource mobilisation finance, social inclusion, knowledge base and legislation, pollution control, agri-forestry and biodiversity.
The ministry informed the committee that the financing strategy for Living Indus would concentrate on international support, public finance, community involvement and public-private partnerships.
Moreover, former Senator Nisar Memon provided a detailed briefing on the new convention on Delta Unite (The Convention on Conservation of Deltas).
He highlighted the challenges of the Indus River, emphasising that the real issue lay in surface and groundwater, posing a regional and global challenge.
He pointed out that livelihoods, including agriculture, fishing and livestock rearing had been adversely affected, leading to various social issues such as poverty and healthcare concerns.
In general, he commended the Living Indus initiative and expressed appreciation for the Senate team’s active participation in COP 28. The meeting concluded with the chairperson’s suggestion to emphasise climate change in policy-making and foster public awareness to discourage use of plastic.

The federal cabinet, which met here under the chairmanship of interim Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar, besides other agenda items, after holding a discussion on the issue of the regularisation of 227 teachers, approved it.
A few months ago, the education ministry had regularised the services of 137 daily wage teachers of grade 16 and above; however, it referred the case of said 227 teachers, who had passed the FPSE-conducted tests, to the federal cabinet for a final decision, which on Wednesday approved regularisation of these teachers as well.
Now, after cabinet approval, the issue of daily-wage college teachers has been resolved; however, around 1000 daily-wage school teachers of grade 14 are still pending. The daily-wage school teachers have been serving in FDE-run schools for the last decade and so. They have been demanding their regularisation of service, but to no avail.
“Resolving teachers of grade 16 and above is a great step of education ministry and federal government, now, the ministry should look into the issue of school teachers and other daily wage workers,” said an official of FDE.

4,CDA sells four plots for Rs7.7 billion,Three-day auction gets mixed response from investors on first day,"ISLAMABAD: The cash-strapped civic agency on the opening day of the three-day auction of commercial plots got mixed response from investors, as it fetched at least Rs7.7 billion by auctioning four plots at Gandhara Centre in F-9 Park on Wednesday.
The CDA auctioned two plots in I-8 Markaz and one each in Blue Area and I-14 Markaz. An official said that a plot in the I-8 sector measuring 666.66 square yards was sold (Rs1.725 million per sq yard) for Rs1.14 billion. Another plot in the markaz measuring 800 square yards was auctioned for Rs1.46 billion (Rs 1.825 million per sq yard).
Similarly, a plot measuring 533.33 sq yard in I-14 Markaz was sold against (Rs1.225 million per sq yard) for Rs653 million and a Blue Area plot in the G-8 portion, measuring 2666.66 sq yard fetched Rs4.53 billion. It was auctioned for Rs1.7 million per sq yard.
“Today we auctioned four plots for Rs7.79 billion,” said a member of the auction committee. He added initially the auction garnered a lacklustre response, with not a single plot sold till 1pm. However, in the afternoon, four plots were successfully auctioned, providing a sigh of relief to the civic agency, he added.

Three-day auction gets mixed response from investors on first day

Normally, the CDA hold auctions after six months, but this time, the civic agency decided to hold this auction as it requires billions of rupees to fund its ongoing development works in the capital. It is relevant to note that the CDA has been facing financial constraints, forcing it to hold this auction just three months after the previous one.
“I do agree. These days are not ideal in terms of investment due to general elections slated for next month. However, we had no other option but to go for this auction. Frankly speaking, the response so far is good as we have auctioned four plots against Rs8 billion. If we manage to sell more plots in the next two days that would be our major achievement,” said a director of the CDA.
In October, the CDA had received a lukewarm response to its four-day auction. At the time, the CDA had managed to generate Rs12.9 billion against its target of Rs20 billion. It was able to auction nine commercial, two residential and 14 half-marla (150 square feet each) plots for fruit, vegetable, and meat shops.
In this auction, the CDA has put up over 30 commercial plots for sale. The civic agency, being an autonomous body, has to foot the bill for its development and non-development expenditures. It has around 15,000 employees as well as thousands of pension cases. Additionally, it has to pay millions of rupees in terms of utility services every month. Since its inception, the CDA has been depending on its land bank as it regularly holds auctions of plots to generate funds. On the other hand, the civic agency, which is the custodian of Islamabad’s land, has so far failed to have its property and projects to generate monthly income.
Commenting on CDA’s auction, former president of the Islamabad Developer Association Chaudhry Naseer Ahmed said that he was expecting a “good response” from investors on the second day of the auction. He said that CDA should take steps to materialise its commitment to investors, as last year CDA had auctioned plots for a food street, but the development work still has not started. For the upcoming auctions, he urged the CDA to facilitate businessmen by enhancing the period of payment against plots from the existing one-year period to two years.

Malik Arif Mehmood, vice chairman cantonment board while commenting on the question has said that diehard workers of the partyare not happy with such a decision which is against the ground realities.

Pakistan has been an ardent supporter of GHSA, steering collective efforts towards a safer and more secure world,” the minister added.
He further underscored the importance of multisectoral collaboration, where the interplay of health, environment, agriculture, and security is crucial.
During his remarks, Dr Nadeem Jan said: “the significance of our collective efforts cannot be overstated, especially against the backdrop of recent global health crises, including the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. We have witnessed the interconnectedness of our nations and the imperative of a unified response to emerging health threats. In the face of complex global health challenges, this summit serves as a beacon of collaboration and innovation. Together, we embark on a journey to strengthen our collective defenses, share knowledge, and chart a resilient course for the well-being of our nations.”
Federal Secretary Health Iftikhar Ali Shalwani underscored the importance of the summit and said that the summit symbolized unwavering commitment to furthering a safer world, where health security knew no borders.
“Our collective mission over the next two days is to chart a course toward a future where health security is not a privilege but a fundamental human right,” he added.
In second session, Dr Rana Mohammad Safdar led a panel of distinguished speakers in a discussion on Pandemic Preparedness and Response. The session featured insights from international experts, shedding light on essential attributes and strategies to enhance global health resilience.

He was addressing a press conference in Hazro town of Attock on Tuesday. Mr Khanzada said that conspirators wanted the economy to default but all their designs were foiled. He said that that perpetrators and executors of May 9 incidents would not be allowed to escape.
Commenting over a video statement posted by his political rival, PTI district President Qazi Ahmed Akbar, he stated that the political leaders hiding and giving statements through social media platforms instead of coming out from their hideouts and facing people publicly should surrender themselves before court of law.
Khanzada asked workers of PTI to get rid of their leadership, who were uttering anti-state remarks for personal gains. He was of the view that people of Chhachh area of Attock now become well aware of the fact that which political leader had roots in the public and served them at their doorsteps and who were hiding behind curtain and avoiding to face public through different lame excuses.
“No one is above the law and a public leader should dare to face the consequences of their acts not hiding and remaining underground to win the sympathies of the voters through such tactics”.
Khanzada said those who wanted to obliterate the PML-N and its identity had been obliterated themselves by the grace of God. “Praise be to Allah, the integrity and honesty of our leadership has proved and we have overcome every challenge.”

The event slammed the terror attacks at Alamdar Road on January 10, 2013 and on Karani Road in February 2013, while mentioning that the ethnic cleansing of the Hazara population has continued for the last two decades.
It was highlighted that more than 3,500 people have died since 1999, and around 2,000 have suffered permanent disabilities.
In total, 130 people lost their lives in the terror attack of January 10, 2013 on Alamdar Road, and in the February 2013 massive blast, 110 people were killed. Both the incidents occurred in residential areas, killing women and children too.
The organisers of the vigil demanded the authorities to take action to ensure long-term peace as terror incidents were occurring again in Balochistan.
The speakers criticised that despite the terror groups taking on the responsibility of the attack, the judicial system and the security forces failed to book any culprits.
Hazara community activist Fatima Atif, while expressing a lack of trust in the government functionaries, demanded that there be a United Nations (UN)-led probe into the continuous targeted killings of Hazara people in Balochistan.
She stated that the people of Hazara were an easy target due to their distinct faces, adding that the banned sectarian groups were involved in the killings as the Hazara people belong to the Shia school of thought.
Other speakers recalled that anti-shia slogans were raised recently in the federal capital by the workers of the proscribed party, but the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration did not take notice of them.
Activists, including Tahira Abdullah and Tariq Ghori, were also present during the vigil.

Addressing the iVerify launch ceremony here at the Serena Hotel in Islamabad, Amber Rahim Shamsi, Director CEJ-IBA, said that the tool would prove to be an important step in ensuring transparent and verifiable news reporting and investigation methodologies, says a press release issued here.
“Seeing the rise of misinformation in both digital and conventional media spaces, the fact-checking mechanism established by iVerify shall become a cornerstone of reliable, non-partisan journalism in Pakistan,” the press release quoted her as saying.
She said that iVerify currently offers one of the few robust verification approaches for journalists in the country, with an emphasis on eliminating bias, authenticating facts, and processing news articles through manual examination. It is internationally accredited by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and has been successfully implemented in a number of countries around the world.
The tool allows journalists and media professionals to submit their stories via iVerify’s portal on the CEJ-IBA website, where their stories are gauged through a multi-pronged approach comprising data-driven and language-based evaluation before being verified for accuracy in terms of factual representation and contextualization.
The launch was followed by a panel discussion by senior media professionals, including Mansoor Ali Khan,  Farhad Jarral, Absa Komal, Umer Cheema, and Nizam Salarzai, who dissected the utility of a fact-checking tool in a high-stakes journalism environment. Given the potentially volatile nature of newsrooms during election transmissions anticipated during the incoming general elections, the panel agreed that the tool would prove to play a critical role in curbing the spread of misinformed news stories and making space for responsible, careful journalism.

While speaking to the business community at the AJK Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the high commissioner said that the visit had reaffirmed her view that across Pakistan there was a lot more that both sides could do together.
This, she said, included liberalising trade, opening up investment opportunities, bringing in new technologies, or helping Pakistan on the path to sustainable growth and clean energy.
“I return to Islamabad with a strong feeling that our two countries together are primed to grow even closer and continue to work hard to deepen our relationship,” she said.
The high commissioner also visited Muslim Hands Football Academy where she met Street Children Team runners-up at the Street Children Football World Cup in Qatar.
“The footballing talent here at the academy is incredible, and I am pleased to know about their performance in Qatar. It is great to see so many British Pakistanis supporting this excellent organisation- Pakistanis and Brits share a huge love of sport – and the UK is committed to promoting sports in Pakistan, including football,” she said.
“Our Chevening scholarship on football science, sponsored by Swindon Town Football Club, is a celebration of this shared love, helping to build the next generation of football coaches,” she added.
The High Commissioner and the Head of Pakistan Department also met with members of the British community in Mirpur alongside the AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood to discuss their priorities and the importance of people to people links.
