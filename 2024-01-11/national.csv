0,Reconstitution of missing persons’ body okayed,"Cabinet approves regularisation of 227 teachers, formation of regulatory body for cannabis control.","ISLAMABAD: Amid a prolonged protest by the families of missing persons in Islamabad, the federal cabinet on Wednesday approved the reconstitution of its committee on forced disappearances, headed by the law minister.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the committee was reconstituted on a recommendation by the ministry of interior after the chairman’s slot fell vacant due to the resignation of former interior minister Sarfraz Bugti.
 
 

Families of missing persons, mainly from Balochistan, have set up a camp outside the National Press Club to press the caretaker government for recovery of their loved ones. They organised a rally on Dec 21, but it led to baton-charge by police and arrests.
The next day, caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar formed a special committee, headed by the former interior minister, to meet the families of missing persons and address their grievances.

Cabinet approves regularisation of 227 teachers, formation of regulatory body for cannabis control

Although many of the protesters were released, a good number of them are still in custody.
The cabinet gave its nod to the formation of a regulatory body for cannabis control by approving the Cannabis Control and Regulatory Authority Ordinance 2024 and forwarded it to the Committee for Legislative Cases.
Teachers’ regularisation
The cabinet meeting, chaired by PM Kakar, approved reguralisation of 227 daily-wage teachers on a proposal by the Federal Directorate of Education and as recommended by the Federal Public Service Commission. The approval was in compliance of a verdict of the Islamabad High Court given in 2018.
 






It approved a summary regarding the Livestock and Dairy Development Board in order to fulfil a legal requirement before the appointment of a chief executive, in compliance of decisions given by the high courts of Islamabad and Balochistan.
The authority will draw up guidelines for the cultivation, extraction and refining of cannabis.
Attacks on polio teams
The caretaker prime minister spoke at length on recent attacks on polio teams, restating the government’s resolve to carry on the anti-polio drive for eradication of the disease.
The meeting offered Fateha for the security officials who were martyred during a vaccination drive in Bajaur.
 






The prime minister paid tribute to the martyred personnel and said the state would not forget their invaluable sacrifice.
“The security officials sacrificed their lives for the safety of future generations,” Anwaarul Haq Kakar said.
“The terrorists cannot break the nation’s determination to fight polio.”
Health security summit
Earlier, the caretaker prime minister addressed the inaugural session of the first-ever Global Health Security Summit.
He stressed the need to explore sources for global funds that could support nations in times of need and for ensuring that no one was left behind in the pursuit of health security.
 






“The call for a sufficiently funded, wid­ely supported medium-term roadmap, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations Core Capacities evaluation, re­­­sonates globally. “We must invest in open, transparent, and multi-sectoral processes to strengthen buy-in and commitment at all levels,” the prime minister said.
He said a “One Health” approach recognised the interconnectedness of human, animal and environmental health.
“Our commitment should extend to establishing global frameworks that facilitate information sharing, joint research, and collaborative strategies for an effective response during emergencies,” he added.
The caretaker prime minister stressed the need for a strong and visible public health system that was vital to early detection, response, and mitigation.
PM Kakar also called for collaboration to establish international standards for food safety to ensure the highest level of protection for humanity worldwide. He said the Covid-19 pandemic had taught the world invaluable lessons about the importance of collaboration, preparedness, and a unified response.
“It is in this spirit that we convene today, not merely as representatives of our respective countries, but as overseers of global health security.”

1,PIA receives aircraft after clearance of payment,"With the induction of A320, the number of these aircrafts in the PIA fleet is 15.","RAWALPINDI: One of Airbus A320 aircraft was handed over to Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) on Wednesday at a formal ceremony held at Islamabad International Airport.
Airbus A320 was formally inducted into the PIA fleet as the second Airbus A320 is expected to arrive in Pakistan over the next two weeks.
This was one of the two aircraft which were stuck in Malaysia over a payment dispute.
With the induction of A320, the number of A320 aircraft in the PIA fleet has been 15 aircraft. Out of the 15 A320 aircraft, nine have been flying.
 






In the ceremony, Adviser to the PM on Aviation retired Air Marshal Farhat Hussain Khan, Secretary retired Captain Saif Anjum, PIA CEO Air Vice Marshal Amir Hayat, PCAA Director General Khaqan Murtaza and other senior officers participated in the event.
Addressing the ceremony, the PM’s adviser said this was a sigh of relief owing to the tireless efforts of the PIA team.
He highlighted that the induction would enhance the revenue of the national flag carrier, adding that the second aircraft would also be inducted into the PIA fleet in about next two weeks.
Airbus A320 was then sent to Indonesia, with two pilots. A crew member took off from Jakarta and after refueling from Bangkok and then the aircraft landed at IIAP.
Senior officials of PIA management received the aircraft which is now part of the PIA fleet.
A high-level delegation of PIA headed by the aviation secretary visited to resolve the issue in October 2023.
The PIA’s two aircraft A320 had been parked in Jakarta since September 2021 due to a dispute with the leasing company.
The PIA had to pay $26 million to the leasing company. Since the payment has been cleared now, second A320 aircraft will reach Pakistan in the next two weeks.

2,PML-N to launch its election campaign from 15th,Rana Sanaullah claims there have been no differences within the party over award of tickets; IPP’s Aleem hints at contesting from NA-117.,"LAHORE: The PML-N has finally announced launching of its election campaign across the country from Jan 15, the day it is going to put out its manifesto.
The party’s announcement came on Wednesday when PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in Lahore taunted the Sharifs for their failure to launch polls campaign and field its candidates.
“The PML-N will launch the election campaign in the country from Jan 15 under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif,” PML-N Punjab president Rana Sanaullah said on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday.
 






The PML-N is all set to bring out its manifesto, for which it created much hype, on Jan 15.
For the last two months the PML-N’s over 30 different sub-committees have been sitting together to prepare the party’s election manifesto. The delay in preparation of the manifesto has put a question mark on the ability of the committees’ chief Senator Irfan Siddiqui for his failure to effectively coordinate with committees to get the job done at the earliest.

Rana Sanaullah claims there have been no differences within the party over award of tickets

“Nawaz Sharif wants a manifesto which has a mass appeal, different from other parties’ manifesto, besides it shows him a democrat who believes in the power of vote,” a party insider told Dawn.
Nawaz Sharif had been perturbed for his party being labelled as the ‘favourite’ of the establishment, an impression he desperately wanted to dispell during the election campaign which will kick off next week, he added.
 
 

Regarding problems over award of tickets, Mr Sanaullah claimed there had been no differences in the party over award of tickets. However, he said, consultation was under way (over the tickets issue) in some constituencies.
He further said the PML-N would announce award of tickets in a day or two. “The mandatory assessment has been done on party tickets; the president’s office will issue the list shortly.”
On the possibility of delay in polls, Mr Sanaullah said the PML-N had made it clear that his party was not in favour of delay in elections. “We want free and fair elections on time.”
 
 

Delay in the launch of polls campaign is primarily caused by the PML-N’s long deliberations in ticket distribution and seat adjustment with the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) and PML-Q.
Besides, the party showed no rush in this regard as the confidence is apparently due to the complacency for having a “good equation” with the powerful quarters.
On the other hand, the PPP is running an aggressive campaign. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has been in Lahore for over a week, openly campaigning in the city’s NA-127 constituency and calling out the Sharifs almost daily.
PML-N’s Tarar to take on PPP chief in NA-127
Although the PML-N has yet to announce the party tickets, its deputy secretary general Attaullah Tarar launched his election campaign in NA-127 on Wednesday saying there would be a good fight between him and Bilawal Bhutto.
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI)’s Sardar Latif Khosa and Senator Ijaz Chaudhry have also filed nomination papers from this constituency.
“We will not target personalities as we talk on the problems the people are facing and our development work during the campaign,” he said.
IPP’s Aleem hints at contesting from NA-117
As the PML-N is “compelled” to accommodate key candidates of IPP,  the latter’s president Aleem Khan on Wednesday hinted at contesting on NA-117 instead of NA-119 (Lahore) where PML-N chief organiser Maryam Nawaz is also in the run for Feb 8 polls.
“Mian Junaid Zulfiqar, a candidate of PP-145 which falls in NA-117, has met me and decided to participate in his election campaign,” Aleem Khan said. Mr Zulfiqar, along with all his colleagues, announced joining the IPP.
Earlier, Aleem Khan reportedly had requested the Sharifs to ask Maryam Nawaz to vacate the NA-119 seat for him as he had already launched his campaign from there.
“However, Ms Nawaz told the leadership to adjust Aleem on NA-117 as even this will be a favour to him,” the source said.

3,‘Intel bosses may be taken to task over disappearances’,ISLAMABAD: Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday said that the time will come...,"ISLAMABAD: Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday said that the time will come when senior officials of intelligence agencies would be prosecuted for enforced disappearances. 
Justice Kayani made these remarks while hearing a petition against manhandling of Baloch protesters.
Attorney General Anwar Mansoor Awan informed the court that the federal government would submit an affidavit before the Supreme Court and provide an undertaking against enforced disappearances.  
Justice Kayani commented that state institutions should have faith in the judicial system. He added that a lack of trust in the judicial system results in enforced disappearances and detaining a citizen without due process would be a futile exercise if there is no probability of conviction.
According to him, the fight against terrorism cannot be effectively carried out by detaining people based on suspicions alone. 
Justice Kayani emphasised that the concept of disappearances is alien in civilised societies, and the prime minister would be held responsible if a citizen goes missing.
During the course of the hearing, Imaan Mazari, counsel for the Baloch protesters, informed the court that nine missing students have been recovered, while the whereabouts of 15 are still unknown. 
Justice Kayani remarked that Pakistan’s image is deteriorating globally due to enforced disappearances, and the highest office is required to submit an undertaking that the state is not behind this menace.
The counsel said that the Balochs are protesting against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. 
A woman protester ur­­g­ed the court to provide some hope, or else they would lose faith in the system.
Justice Kayani emphasised that higher authorities, including the prime minister and his cabinet members, are responsible for ensuring the right to liberty of the citizen. He adjourned the hearing in this matter till Feb 13.

4,"Fundamental rights cannot be sacrificed, observes Justice Ayesha",39-page judgement of case regarding trial of civilians in military courts issued; says concept of fair trial must be adhered to.,"ISLAMABAD: Justice Ayesha A. Malik, a member of the bench which had declared as unconstitutional the trial of 103 civilians in the May 9 violence case, on Wednesday said that fundamental rights cannot be sacrificed simply because it was deemed expedient.
The government is clear that the detained suspects are ordinary citizens, yet it was compelled to try these 103 persons before the military courts even though they can be tried before the ordinary courts, Justice Malik regretted in a 39-page judgement she authored to explain why on Oct 23, a five-judge bench headed by Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan had unanimously declared the trial of these civilians as against the law.
 
 

But on Dec 13, 2023, a verdict by a majority of five to one suspended the operation of the Oct 23 short order.
Interestingly, Justice Malik observed, when it came to dealing with terrorists who were waging war against Pakistan, it took a constitutional amendment (21st Amend­ment) to bring that category of persons within the jurisdiction of the military courts. Yet now the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952 and its existence since the F.B. Ali case are being relied on to try ordinary citizens.
Justice Malik regretted that offences under the Official Secrets Act (OSA) were triable before the ordinary criminal courts, which guarantees fair trial, due process and independence as mandated by the Consti­tu­tion.
None of the 103 persons were reported for offences under the OSA, yet applications were made under Section 549 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) 1898 for their delivery to military authorities.
The criminal court having jurisdiction over the matter was obligated to form a reasoned opinion whether an accused was to be tried by a military court because the transfer from the ordinary court to the military court for trial amounts to the loss of right to fair trial and due process as well as the right to independent forum, Justice Malik explained.
Burden on magistrate
This places a heavy burden on the magistrate under Section 549 of CrPC to protect the rights of the accused as the (court of) magistrate must satisfy itself that the accused is subject to PAA and can only be tried before a military court, Justice Malik observed.
The denial of a reasoned order by the magistrate is in fact the start of the process which is in contravention of the law as well as denial of the fundamental right of fair trial and due process for the detained citizens, the judgement said.
 
 

Fair trial standards have global recognition and acceptability as being the minimum requirement for a person facing a trial, it said.
The right to call witnesses, cross-examine them and to get a reasoned judgement against which the right of appeal is available is also considered mandatory without which this fundamental guarantee of fair trial, rule of law and due process becomes illusionary, Justice Malik said.
According to the judgement, an important feature of fair trial is access to an independent judicial forum and the separation of powers of the judiciary from the executive and the legislature.
The independence of the judiciary should be guaranteed by the state as enshrined in the Constitution and respected and observed by the state.
The judicial independence is also a pre-requisite to the rule of law, which requires judicial forums to be independent, impartial and maintain integrity.
Right to fair trial
Article 10A of the Constitution is a categoric, unqualified and fundamental right to the existence of any person who is to face trial, Justice Malik said, adding that in the F.B. Ali case, the Supreme Court had held with reference to the concept of fair trial that courts cannot strike down a law on any such ethical notion nor can the courts act on the basis of a philosophical concept of law.
With the inclusion of Article 10A, the concept of fair trial and due process are now neither ethical notions nor philosophical concepts.
It is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution which must be adhered to, Justice Malik said.
Likewise, Justice Yahya Afridi in his 20-page judgement said that principles laid down in the F.B. Ali case judgment by a five-judge bench almost half a century ago, had survived the repeated tests of watchful judicial review and thus always referred to whenever any dispute regarding civilians being tried by a court martial or any other forum constituted under sub-constitutional legislation was in question.
But the case decided by the five-judge bench was co-equal in numeric strength by the present bench that heard challenges to the trial of civilians by the military courts, Justice Afridi said, adding that it was a well settled principle that an earlier judgement of a bench was binding not only on the benches of smaller numeric strength but also on the benches of co-equal strength.
Thus a bench of this court cannot deviate from the earlier held by a co-equal bench of this court, Justice Afridi said, adding if a contrary view had to be taken then the proper course was to request for the constitution of a larger bench to reconsider the earlier view. Thus the present bench is bound with the earlier view taken in the F.B. Ali case.

5,IHC summons top officials over ‘missing’ PTI candidate,Barrister Abdullah Mumtaz Kahloon had filed his nomination papers from Sargodha's PP-76 and disassociated from PTI in a newly emerged video.,"ISLAMABAD: Islam­abad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq on Wednesday summoned the joint secretaries of the ministries of defence and interior in connection with the ‘disappearance’ of a PTI candidate.
Justice Farooq had directed the government agencies on Tuesday to produce Barrister Abdullah Mumtaz Kahloon, who had reportedly “disappeared” from Islamabad airport.
 
 

Mr Kahloon had filed his nomination papers to contest the election from PP-76 Sargodha and was considered one of the potential PTI candidates.
He was nominated as an accused in an FIR and sought protective bail from the IHC chief justice.
His counsel argued that Mr Kahloon intended to surrender before the competent forum, and the court issued a stay order against his possible arrest.
However, upon landing at the airport, he was allegedly picked up by unknown persons. Justice Farooq instructed the authorities to trace the “abductors” with the help of CCTV footage.
Later on Tuesday night, a video of Mr Kahloon emerged on social media in which he stated that he was with a friend. He also denounced the May 9 violence and disassociated himself from the PTI.
 






In the video message, he apologised for not appearing before the court due to being unwell.
When the hearing in this matter resumed on Wednesday, AAG Munawar Iqbal Duggal told the court that the CCTV footage of the airport revealed Mr Kahloon went with three-four persons on his own and did not resist. Justice Farooq inquired whether the persons were masked or identifiable.
Mr Duggal replied that they were not wearing masks. Upon the court’s query, he stated that the footage could be referred to the investigation agencies to trace these people. The court summoned the senior authorities of the defence and interior ministries and adjourned the hearing till Jan 15.
