0,PTI seeks postal ballot if Imran detained,Lauds PHC decision to reinstate 'Bat'; says ticket allocation process completing today,"PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan on Wednesday expressed the party’s intent to apply for a postal ballot provision should Imran Khan remain imprisoned during the elections.
""We're exploring the option of seeking permission for postal ballots if Imran Khan's release isn’t secured before the elections,"" he said while speaking to the media following his meeting with the former prime minister in Adiala Jail.
He shared that discussions with the PTI's founding chairman regarding the allocation of party tickets were underway, adding that the process would be completed on Thursday (today).
Candidates from constituencies across Pakistan would be actively involved in the electoral contest, he assured.
Barrister Gohar Khan hailed the Peshawar High Court's (PHC) decision to reinstate the bat symbol, declaring it a symbol of the party’s victory.
He criticised the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), alleging deliberate obstruction in returning the symbol to PTI, portraying it not just as a PTI symbol but as a representation of the people's rights in Pakistan.
He further alleged that the attempts to snatch the bat symbol threatened the integrity of upcoming elections, fostering an environment ripe for corruption.
Touching upon the intra-party polls that resulted in his chairmanship, Barrister Gohar noted that no other party has held such transparent polls.
He announced the release of finalised candidate lists and dismissed any insinuations of favouritism in the ticket allocation process, assuring that all information would be shared with the media.
""To ensure fair representation, committees have been established at various levels for ticket allocation,"" he said.
On the subject of the ongoing cypher case, he expressed optimism about the court providing relief and ensuring an open trial.

1,Indus River ‘2nd most polluted’ in world,Senate panel discusses ways to combat smog,"The officials of the climate change ministry on Wednesday informed a Senate panel that Indus River had turned into the second most polluted one in the world as the drainage water of 388 cities of Pakistan fell directly into it.
A meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change presided by Senator Seemee Ezdi was held at the Parliament House. Ezdi said when she returned to the federal capital from Karachi, she was surprised to see fog at the Islamabad airport.
“Islamabad has never seen such intense fog before,” she added. Pakistan Meteorological Department Director General Mahr Sahibzad Khan told the committee that fog had increased in Islamabad because of the lack of rains in December.

He continued that the probability of rain this year would be more in the coming days. He told the panel that there were likely to be more rains in the last week of January. Khan explained that smog was formed by the toxic substance of different gases.
He attributed 45% of smog to smoke emitted by vehicles. Senator Farooq Hamid Naek said fog occurred all over the world but Pakistan was responsible for the smog itself. He pointed out that the coal plant installed in Sahiwal was also causing smog. He noted that the coal for this plant came from Karachi.
“It would have been better if it [coal plant] had been installed next to Karachi,” he added. Climate Change Secretary Asif Hyder Shah told the committee that that the intensity of cold in Islamabad in January this year had decreased than what it was in the past.

“All these are the effects of climate change. Now we have to decide how to deal with it,” he continued. The official said at the recent 28th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Pakistan faced a lot of pressure for using coal plants but they presented their arguments.
He added that it took 30 years for developed countries to reach a stage where they could use other sources of energy. However, the official conceded that eventually the country would also have to opt for alternative energy sources,
He stressed the need to stop burning crop waste in fields to combat smog. The officials of the climate change ministry said five brick kilns were closed in Islamabad, They added that some brick kilns had been changed to zigzag method.
The officials said climate change also had negative economic effects, stressing the need for oil refineries to use quality oil.

2,Faizabad sit-in: services chiefs asked to penalise personnel,Defence secy tells body he wrote letters to top military officials,"In light of the Supreme Court's directives, Defence Secretary Lt Gen (retd) Hamooduz Zaman Khan has sent letters to the three services chiefs to take action against the officers and personnel involved in the case of the 2017 Faizabad sit-in staged by the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).
In his written statement submitted to a three-member Faizabad sit-in inquiry commission, the defence secretary said he had written letters to the chiefs of army, navy and air force to take action against the officers and personnel involved in the TLP demonstration.
The commission, formed to identify those who planned, financed, and supported the sit-in at Islamabad’s Faizabad around six years back, has already questioned former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, ex-chairman of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) Absar Alam and former inspector general of police Punjab Arif Nawaz.
The body had also summoned PML-N president and former premier Shehbaz Sharif on January 3 in his capacity as the ex-chief minister of Punjab. However, Shehbaz failed to appear before the commission and asked it to send him a questionnaire pertaining to the inquiry they wanted to conduct.
The inquiry body has to submit its report to the top court on January 22.
It will also recommend legal actions against those who both planned and executed the protest.
Earlier, former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed submitted his written statement to the commission.
While giving his statement, Faiz answered the questions given by the commission, in which he said that he had negotiated with the TLP on the instructions of the government.
Faiz denied the allegations of any conspiracy against the government.
Constituted under Section 3 of the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act, 2017, the commission is led by Syed Akhtar Ali Shah, a former civil servant, who also served as the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa police chief.
It also comprises Tahir Alam Khan, also a former police officer, and Khushal Khan, an additional secretary at the interior ministry.
The TLP, then led by Allama Khadim Hussain Rizvi, had staged the sit-in in protest against the changes made in the lawmakers’ oath, affirming their belief that the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is the last messenger of God.
As a result of the protest, the PML-N government had to sack its law minister Zahid Hamid. The Supreme Court had taken suo motu notice of the sit-in on Nov 21, 2017.

3,PPP 'sole contender in Punjab fray': Bilawal,Former foreign minister derides PML-N's claims of dominance in the region,"Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Wednesday directed pointed jibes at the PML-N and PTI, asserting that his party was the sole contender in the political arena while ""those said to be heavyweights"" remain conspicuously absent from the scene.
Addressing his supporters following a dinner gathering with party workers from constituency NA-127 in Lahore, the former foreign minister emphasised the significance of the event, aimed at acquainting the people of Lahore, Punjab, with PPP’s dedicated workers “and to demonstrate our readiness for the contest”.
Deriding PML-N's claims of dominance in the region, he noted that the party was nowhere to be seen while its candidates remained unknown. He further questioned the purported influence of PTI in Lahore, urging the public to evaluate the reality of PTI's stronghold in the city. “The PPP is the sole party that is ready to contest the elections in Lahore.”
Bilawal also announced that Misbah ur Rehman has agreed to contest the elections from Lahore, emerging as the candidate for PP-160. Besides, the PPP finalised Faisal Mir as its candidate for PP-161. Similarly, Manzar Abbas Khokhar, formerly associated with PML-N and now a member of PPP, has been chosen to represent the Party in PP-162.

Chairman Bilawal extended a warm welcome to Mr Bhatti, formerly a PTI ticket holder, who has switched allegiance to PPP. He will now stand as the PPP candidate for PP-163. In addition, Mr Gurkhi has been selected to represent the PPP in PP-157. Chairman Bilawal highlighted that this constitutes the PPP's electoral panel from NA-127.
Expressing confidence in implementing the PPP's message of unity and harmony, he affirmed the party’s commitment to commence this endeavour from NA-127. “We have to bury the conflicts within to work under the flag of the PPP, and strive for the sake of the ‘arrow’ and Quaid-e-Awam Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, to show the world that Lahore was, is and will forever belong to the Bhuttos.”
Bilawal emphasized, ""We're not easily intimidated; we have never yielded to tyranny and remain steadfastly dedicated to serving the nation's people. Our party’s workers must reach every doorstep, spreading our message and the 10-point socioeconomic contract with the citizens.""
He pledged to the people that if entrusted with the chance to lead as their prime minister, he would commit to doubling people's salaries within five years, ensuring 300 units of free electricity, and securing free, high-quality education for the youth. He expressed his desire to replicate the establishment of world-class healthcare facilities, free of charge, in Lahore and across Punjab, similar to the successful model implemented in Sindh.

“We will also build three million houses for our poor brothers and give the ownership to the women of the households. It's crucial that the arrow is stamped on election day to make this a reality,” he said. Moreover, the onus is on the workers of the party to visit areas with temporary housing and tell them that the PPP government will regularise their housing.
“We will not only expand the Benazir Income Support Programme but facilitate our farmers and workers through the ‘Benazir Mazdoor Card’ and ‘Benazir Kissan Card’.” Chairman Bilawal directed the workers to apprise the youth of the PPP’s ‘Youth Card’, the aspiration behind which is to help them prosper by supporting them financially. “We also aim to eradicate hunger, for which we will initiate the ‘Bhook Mitao Programme’.”
He further said that he vows to ensure that the plethora of issues faced by the people are addressed, be it poverty, unemployment or inflation. “The PPP does not believe in the politics of hate and division, and it wishes to put an end to the traditional form of politics. We wish to introduce a new form of politics, that forgoes the personal vendettas and egoism.”
The elections are to take place on February 8, he added. Taking a jibe at the PML-N once again, he said that the PML-N has made a habit of running from the elections, be it the local government elections, by-elections or general elections.“The people now have to show the PML-N that the elections will take place on February 8 and it has nowhere to run. The PPP will be victorious and change the destiny of the people,” he asserted.

4,PML-N revs up election drive,Party allocates tickets in key districts,"Amid mounting criticism over the delay in its election strategy and ticket allocations, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Wednesday not only unveiled plans to kickstart its electoral campaign on January 15 but also finalised the distribution of party tickets across 21 districts, including Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala.
This update was confirmed at the time of this report's filing. As per the party's notification, PML-N distributed National Assembly tickets and provincial assembly seats among candidates hailing from 21 districts. The recipients spanned Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Nankana Sahib, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Chiniot, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, Sialkot, Jhelum, Chakwal, Talagang, Attock, Narowal, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad, Kasur, Sahiwal, Okara, Pakpattan, and Hafizabad.
The party seems to have reserved certain seats for potential adjustments with other parties, such as NA-64 Gujrat and two provincial seats under it for PML-N.
As per PML-N leader Abid Raza, the party has allocated NA-64 to Chaudhary Salik Hussain, along with the two associated seats for his party, as part of honouring their commitment.
A surprise inclusion in the allocations was NA-75 (Narowal) being awarded to Chaudhry Anwar Iqbal, which meant that Danyal Aziz was given the boot due to his criticisms against his constituency colleague, Ahsan Iqbal. Contrary to earlier predictions, Ahsan Iqbal not only secured a ticket for NA-76 but also for PP-54.
PML-N also kept its promise to former National Assembly opposition leader Raja Raiz, acknowledging his assistance in allowing PML-N to govern with no checks on it during his tenure as a sham opposition leader. After the conclusion of his assembly term, Raja joined PML-N.
In order to accommodate Raja and company, the party had to ditch its leader Rana Ehsan Afzal. Raja was accommodated on NA-104, while PML-N leader Chaudhry Abid Sher Ali secured NA-102 and Rana Sanaullah claimed NA-100.
Talal Chaudhry is expected to be ditched in a constituency which is yet to be announced.
The party accommodated all its old guards in key NA seats in Toba Tek Singh, such as Chaudhary Khalid Javed on NA-105 and Colonel (retd) Ayub Gadhi on PP-112.
In Jhang, PML-N welcomed a new entrant, Makhdoom Faisal Saleh Hayat, who received tickets for NA-108 and PP-125. In Sheikhupura, Rana Tanveer secured the party ticket for NA-114 and PP-139, while Javed Latif obtained the ticket for NA-115.
Chaudhry Muhammad Barjees Tahir was given the NA-111 ticket in Nankana Sahib. In Chiniot, PML-N allocated NA-93 to Syed Muhammad Raza Bukhari and NA-94 to Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh. Meanwhile, in Gujranwala, the party granted NA-78 to senior leader Khurram Dastaghir Khan.
The party allocated the following tickets in various constituencies: Sheikh Aftab Ahmed for NA-49 (Attock), Malik Sohail Khan for NA-50 (Attock), Raja Osama Sarwar for NA-51 (Rawalpindi), Raja Muhammad Javeed Ikhlas for NA-52 (Rawalpindi), Raja Qamar Ul Islam for NA-53 (Rawalpindi), Malik Ibrar Ahmad for NA-55 (Rawalpindi), Muhammad Haneef Abbassi for NA-56 (Rawalpindi), Danyal Chaudary for NA-57 (Rawalpindi), Major (retd) Tahir Iqbal for NA-58 (Chakwal), and Sardar Ghullam Abbass for NA-59 (Talagang).
PML-N leader Bilal Yasin secured a PP-6 ticket from Rawalpindi. In addition, PML-N announced the commencement of its election rallies starting on January 15.

5,Pakistan backs ICJ probe into ‘genocide’ in Gaza,"Council has been paralysed due to resistance and negative vote of permanent member, says Pakistani envoy","Pakistan on Tuesday warned that failure of international efforts to halt the ""brutal"" Israeli war on Gaza risked escalation that could engulf the entire region, as the UN General Assembly debated the use of the veto by the United States in the Security Council last month.
“The council has been paralysed due to the resistance and negative vote of a permanent member,” Ambassador Usman Jadoon, acting permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told the 193-member Assembly -- without naming the US.
“A heavy responsibility rests on those who have enabled the prolongation of this war and the continuing slaughter of innocent civilians in Gaza,” the Pakistani envoy pointed out.
The veto is a special voting power held by the permanent members on the Council, whereby if any one of the five - China, France, Russia, the UK and the US - casts a negative vote, the resolution or decision automatically fails.
Tuesday's meeting was held under the Assembly's standing mandate to convene within 10 working days of a veto being cast in the Council. “Beyond the imperative of an immediate and sustainable ceasefire, we must ensure the provision of adequate humanitarian assistance to the besieged population of Gaza,” the Pakistani envoy said, upholding the peoples' right to life and dignity.

There must be consequences and accountability for Israel’s criminal actions in Palestine, the Pakistani envoy said. In this regard, he said Pakistan welcomed South Africa’s initiative to bring Israel's transgressions under the Genocide Convention to the Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ).
Pakistan, he added, also looks forward to the Advisory Opinion of the ICJ on the legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. “The root cause of this crisis lies in Israel's prolonged occupation and denial of Palestinians' inalienable right to self-determination. Israel's brutal campaign against the occupied people of Palestine struggling for their freedom cannot be justified under the guise of self-defence,” Jadoon said.
“The international community cannot accept the fait accompli Israel is seeking to impose to destroy Palestinian nationhood,” he said.
“The choice before us regarding Palestine is stark: engage in a determined and sustained diplomatic endeavour to implement the two-state solution, or bear witness to the ongoing genocide perpetrated by extremist Israeli leaders, with the tacit or explicit support of some foreign political leaders.”
in the end, the Pakistani envoy called for working collectively to prevent the genocide in Palestine, achieve a two state solution and establish a secure, viable, contiguous, and sovereign state of Palestine on the basis of the pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.

On Dec 22, the United States vetoed an amendment proposed by Russia that would have called for ""an urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access”. Subsequently, the 15-member Council adopted a watered-down resolution calling for speeding aid deliveries to desperate civilians in Gaza but without the original plea for an “urgent suspension of hostilities” between Israel and the Palestinian fighters.
The vote was 13 in favour to none against, with 2 abstentions (United States, Russian Federation).  In his remarks, the Pakistani envoy said that the Council has regrettably failed in fulfilling its obligation to impose a ceasefire. “Pakistan, therefore, reiterates its call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire,” Ambassador Jadoon said, highlighting that Israel's war in Gaza is brutal -- a veritable genocide.
“This latest exercise of the veto reinforces our conviction that the reform of the Security Council should not add more permanent members to its composition,” he said, referring to the push by India, Brazil, Germany and Japan for permanent seats in an expanded Security Council --  a move Pakistan and its allies stoutly oppose.
“Israel's indiscriminate slaughter of innocent Palestinian civilians, including children and women, is a flagrant violation of international law, including the principles of the UN Charter, international humanitarian and human rights law,"" Jadoon said, adding that this genocidal war must be stopped forthwith in accordance with the General Assembly's resounding call for an immediate and unconditional humanitarian ceasefire.
“Pakistan strongly and unequivocally condemns Israel's rejection of a humanitarian ceasefire,” he said.

6,SC says Oct 23rd verdict did not touch past military cases,Issues 78-page detailed judgment against trials of civilians in military courts,"The Supreme Court has held that declaring certain provisions of the Army Act as unconstitutional would not affect the cases of civilians who have already been convicted by military courts.
“Cases of persons convicted by court martial and who have either (i) served out the sentence, or (ii) who are serving the sentence but have exhausted legal remedies and/or whose convictions have otherwise become final, shall be regarded as past and closed, and remain unaffected by this judgment,” reads a 78-page detailed judgment authored by Justice Munib Akhtar against the trials of civilians in military courts.
A five-judge bench of the apex court led by Justice Ijazul Ahsan on Oct 23, 2023 declared that the trials of 103 civilians in military courts were unconstitutional. The bench also held that Clause (d) of subsection (1) of Section 2 of the Army Act [in both of its sub clauses (i) & (ii)] and subsection (4) of Section 59 of the Army Act are ultra vires the Constitution and of no legal effect.
""Although we have made the declaration in para (i) of the short order regarding the vires of the impugned provisions, it must also be recognised that a very great many civilians have been already been convicted and sentenced by courts martial in terms thereof.
“Some regard must be given to this reality and some arrangements made in this regard. Accordingly, it is directed in relation to certain categories of cases as below"", says the judgment.
The judgment clarified that the persons, who have been convicted by court martial and who are still pursuing legal remedies (whether statutory or before a court of law) may apply to the appropriate court, which shall consider the lawfulness of the conviction without reference to this judgment, but if it concludes that the person is otherwise entitled to any relief (including, but not limited to, with regard to the sentence) may, in the facts and circumstances of the case before it, also take this judgment into consideration.
The court also said that neither a petition filed under Article 184(3) of the Constitution nor a petition before the president under Article 45 of the Constitution or any provision of law whereby relief equivalent to the latter “can be sought (other legal remedies having been exhausted) shall be regarded as a pending, or (as the case may be) the pursuing of a, legal remedy"".
""Any person or class of persons for whom a special remedy has been created by law to a court outside the Army Act or equivalent laws (whether by way of a right of review or re-consideration or otherwise) shall, whether convicted or still being tried by court martial, seek his remedy accordingly, and his case shall remain unaffected by this judgment.""
“In view of this clarification, conviction awarded Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav will not be affected”.
Justice Ayesha Malik, in her additional note, said that the military trials of civilians on the other hand totally negates the requirement of an independent and impartial judicial forum, hence, it compromises the right to fair trial. Citizens enjoy the protection of fundamental rights under the Constitution and are assured that they will be treated as per law, such that their life and dignity is protected.
""At the same time, the Constitution commands the legislature to not make law which takes away any fundamental right protected under the Constitution. In this context, the requirement of the Federal Government to try civilians before military courts totally defies the constitutional command and is in derogation to the rights contained in Articles 4, 9, 10A, 14 read with Article 175 of the Constitution,"" said Justice Ayesha.
Unlike the majority opinion, another member of the bench, Justice Yahya Afridi, did not declare certain provisions of the Army Act to try the civilians in military courts as unconstitutional. ""While sitting on a bench of five Judges, I am bound by what was decided in F.B. Ali case, wherein, after testing the provisions of sections  & (ii) and 59(4) of the Army Act on the touchstone of the fundamental rights agitated before the court in the present cases, the Court adjudged them to be intra vires the Constitution, and not violative of articles 9, 10A, and 25 of the Constitution.”
Justice Afridi did not give definite finding and held that the contentions of the counsel for the petitioners, as to reconsidering the law declared in F.B. All case “is undoubtedly legally and constitutionally very weighty, and thus, make a prima facia case, warranting to be considered and decided by a larger bench of more than eight judges of this court, as was right constituted at the commencement of the proceedings of the present cases”.

8,"Naqvi, 7th SC judge to resign prematurely",A number of SC and high court judges have tendered resignations due to SJC proceedings,"Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi is not the first superior court judge to resign from his position in view of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) proceedings. So far, seven judges of the apex court, including Justice Naqvi, have resigned before completion of their terms for a variety of reasons. The number of such high court judges is ten.
In October 2016, Iqbal Hameedur Rahman, a judge of the Supreme Court, resigned from his position after an SC bench invalidated the 74 appointments made to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) while Justice Rahman served at the capital's high court as the chief justice.
In 2001, Justice Rashid Aziz resigned over allegations of bias in a corruption case against former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. In the same year, Justice Malik Muhammad Qayyum of the Lahore High Court (LHC) also left his post due to allegations of bias in the Benazir Bhutto corruption case.
Two Supreme Court judges—Fakir Muhammad Khokhar and Javed Buttar—tendered their resignations on August 6, 2009. These judges had taken an oath under the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) promulgated by General Pervez Musharraf on November 3, 2007.

Justice Khokhar and Justice Buttar resigned after a 14-member SC bench declared the imposition of the November 3, 2007 emergency and subsequent actions as unconstitutional and void on July 31, 2009. The bench held that judges who took an oath under the PCO would be tried in the SJC for committing judicial misconduct.
Two days earlier, on August 4, 2009, BHC Chief Justice Amanullah Khan Yasinzai and four other judges—Justice Ahmed Khan Lashari, Justice Akhtar Zaman Malghani, Justice Nadir Khan Durrani, and Justice Mehta Kalash Nath Kohli—also resigned following the SC order. These BHC judges had also taken oaths of office under the PCO.
In April 2019, Justice Farrukh Irfan of the LHC resigned after a reference was filed against him in the SJC due to his name emerging in the Panama Papers leak. In February 2017, Justice Mazhar Iqbal Siddiqui of the LHC resigned due to proceedings initiated in the SCJ based on corruption allegations.
In May 2015, Justice Muhammad Tasnim of the Sindh High Court resigned for personal reasons. During General Yahya Khan's era, Justice Fazal Ghani of the LHC faced a reference in the SJC, and upon the arrival of the reference against him, he resigned from his position. In contrast, former chief justice Mian Saqib Nisar released pensions amounting to millions to the judges who had taken an oath under the PCO.

The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) after detecting these errors has returned these faulty lists to NADRA for their rectification, official sources revealed to The Express Tribune on Wednesday.
They said NADRA has made several errors in the pictorial electoral rolls for women and men voters. In North Waziristan, Orakzai, Tando Allahyar, and Quetta, women voters were included in men's rolls, while men voters were placed in women's rolls.
Concerns about potential complications during the voting process due to these inaccurate entries in the electoral lists have prompted the ECP to instruct NADRA to rectify these errors.

As per the sources, in case the electoral lists are not corrected by February 8, the election day, men voters will cast their votes with women voters in the four districts.
An electoral list, also known as an electoral roll or voter list, is a comprehensive roster or database containing the names and details of eligible voters within a particular jurisdiction, such as a district, constituency, or region.
This list typically includes information like names, addresses, and sometimes other details like identification numbers or photographs of registered voters.
It serves as a fundamental tool during elections, ensuring that eligible citizens can exercise their right to vote by verifying their registration status and eligibility at polling stations.
