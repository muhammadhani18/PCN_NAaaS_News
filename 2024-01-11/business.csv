KARACHI: Workers’ remittances in December increased by 13.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $2.4 billion, compared to $2.099bn in the same month of the previous fiscal year. 
However, during the first six months of FY24, remittances fell short of the amount the country received in the same period of the previous year. Moreover, remittances from almost all destinations, except European countries, declined.
The State Bank of Pakistan’s latest data issued on Wednesday shows the December remittances were higher by 5.4pc compared to November. The remittances in Nov were $2.258bn.
The remittances during the first half of the current fiscal year were still 6.8pc lower than the previous fiscal year. FY23 was a disappointing year for Pakistan as remittances declined by almost $4bn compared to the preceding year. The first half of the current fiscal year has yet to reach the previous year’s discouraging inflows. 

Six-month inflows drop 6.8pc, declining from all destinations, except Europe

Pakistan received $13.4bn in remittances during July-Dec FY24, compared to $14.417bn in the same period last year, indicating a decline of $983 million.
While the government claims to have achieved success through a crackdown on smuggling and illegal currency business, the low inflows of remittances do not support the claim. The exchange rate appears stable with the crackdown, but the inflows did not improve. Earlier, it was pretended that the black market was attracting dollars from overseas Pakistanis, which was the main reason for the $4bn loss in remittances in FY23. However, the crackdown could not help improve remittances.
Another aspect being discussed in the banking sector is that about one million job seekers left Pakistan in FY23, but their contribution to remittances is almost zero. Exchange companies expressed satisfaction with the crackdown on illegal currency businesses, which stabilised the exchange rate and enabled the open market to sell dollars in the range of $300m to $350m per month to banks. The reason for low remittances is not known in the financial market. It is believed that overseas Pakistanis were keeping their dollars in foreign accounts due to the uncertain political and economic situation in the country.
The country received the highest inflow of $3.054bn from Saudi Arabia during the first six months of this fiscal year, but it noted a decline of 8.9pc compared to the same period last year. The inflows from the US and UK were $1.576bn and $1.988bn, with declines of 2.5pc and 0.6pc, respectively.
Another major inflow was from the UAE, with $2.328bn during the six months, but it declined by 10.9pc compared to last year. The only increase in remittances was noted in the inflows from EU countries. The inflows increased by 8.5pc to $1.695bn compared to the same period last year.

1,"High lending rates, inflation weigh growth outlook down",World Bank sees Pakistan’s economy expanding at a rate of 1.7pc in FY24.,"ISLAMABAD: The World Bank on Wednesday projected Pakistan’s economic outlook to remain subdued during the current fiscal year and slightly recover next year amid prolonged global economic challenges.
“In Pakistan, the economic outlook for FY24 remains subdued, with growth projected at only 1.7pc. Monetary policy is expected to remain tight to contain inflation, while fiscal policy is also set to be contractionary, reflecting pressures from high debt-service payments”, said the World Bank in its latest publication Global Economic Prospects — January 2024” released on Wednesday.
The bank said that weak confidence in Pakistan stemming from political turmoil will contribute to the slow growth in private demand. “As inflationary pressure eases, growth is expected to pick up to 2.4pc in FY25”, it added.
Talking about the continuous slow growth in the global economy, the report described the ongoing decade of the 2020s as a “wasted opportunity” and the outlook as “dark” beyond the next two years. Global growth is projected to slow for the third year in a row — from 2.6pc last year to 2.4pc in 2024, almost three-quarters of a percentage point below the average of the 2010s, it said adding that developing economies estimated to grow just 3.9pc, more than one percentage point below the average of the previous decade.

World Bank sees Pakistan’s economy expanding at a rate of 1.7pc in FY24

It said the economic output in Pakistan contracted an estimated 0.2pc in FY23 as a result of the effects of damage from the 2022 floods and increased political uncertainty. Consumer price inflation remained elevated, partly reflecting currency depreciation in early 2023. However, by late 2023, the rupee showed signs of stabilisation, driven by a variety of factors. These included increased liquidity in the foreign exchange market due to tighter enforcement of regulations, a shrinking money supply, a balance-of-payments surplus on account of low import demand, and a moratorium on Chinese debt repayments.
Spending on food surges
The report noted that as poorer households spend more on food, rising food prices would disproportionately affect the poor and the vulnerable, increasing poverty and inequality. The risk is particularly high in countries with limited fiscal buffers to mitigate adverse effects, including Nepal and Pakistan, and in countries under major security threats, including Afghanistan. In addition, an increase in food insecurity could be exacerbated by the escalation of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.
Talking about the South Asia Region, the report expected the growth to edge marginally lower at 5.6pc in 2024 from an estimated 5.7pc last year — still the fastest pace among all emerging market and developing economy (EMDE) regions — and then firm to 5.9pc in 2025.
Growth in India is projected to remain strong, largely driven by robust investment and services. In other economies, the adverse effects of persistently high inflation and monetary and fiscal policy tightening, as well as policy uncertainty, will weigh on growth. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, with the most pressing concerns being higher energy and food prices caused by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and adverse spillovers from elevated policy rates in advanced economies. Risks of financial and fiscal stress, extreme weather events, slowing activity in China, and election-related uncertainty in some countries pose further downside risks for the region.
In several South Asian economies — Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, and Pakistan —, parliamentary or national assembly elections are scheduled or planned in 2024. The heightened uncertainty around these elections could dampen activity in the private sector, including foreign investment. 
“If combined with political or social unrest and elevated violence, this could further disrupt and weaken economic growth”, it said. In addition, particularly in countries with weak fiscal positions, an increase in spending before these elections could exacerbate macro-fiscal vulnerabilities. However, the implementation of policies to reduce uncertainty and strengthen growth potential after elections could lead to an improvement in prospects.

2,Makers raise steel prices amid dull demand,"New rates of steel bars hover between Rs250,000-262,000 per tonne depending on the quality, says PALSP General Secretary Syed Wajid Bukhari.","KARACHI: Steel bar makers have increased the prices by Rs4,000 per tonne citing a bullish trend in iron and steel scrap on the world markets.
Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSP) General Secretary Syed Wajid Bukhari claimed that the new rates of steel bars hovered between Rs250,000-262,000 per tonne depending on the quality.
He said some loss-making mills could not pass on the needed increase due to low demand. Several units have closed recently and many declared losses and most of the mills are working on 30pc production capacity. “The steel industry is facing its worst crisis after 2008,” he claimed.
He attributed the price hike to a $20-25 per tonne rise in scrap prices in world markets due to the usually low collection of scrap in the winter.
Mr Wajid feared more price hikes due to supply chain disruption as the Red Sea Europe route was affected after attacks on shipping vessels, resulting in a rise in insurance and freight costs.
Some steel dealers said the increase in prices didn’t take effect in real terms amid sluggish demand caused by a construction slowdown in winter. Some dealers were clearing their stocks at old rates.
They quoted the rate of high-quality steel bars in the range of Rs265,000-267,000 per tonne depending on the size of 16m and above to 9.5/10mm.
Pakistan’s iron and steel scrap imports fell by 5pc and 17pc in quantity and value to 1.079m tonnes ($499m) in 5MFY24 from 1.143m tonnes ($65m) in the same period last fiscal year. The average per tonne price (APT) stood at $462 versus $529 in the above period.
In January 2023, steel bar rates were raised to Rs242,500-243,500 per tonne from Rs222,500-225,500 during the last week of December 2022 due to supply chain disruptions, rising raw material prices and high production costs.
The current predicament faced by Karachi-based industries, compounded by non-disbursement of the incremental electricity units consumption subsidy from July 2021 to October 2023,  adds to the challenges already besetting the industry like currency depreciation, high borrowing costs, and substantial increases in input costs, particularly energy prices. 
The subsidy, initially a breath of fresh air, now hangs in limbo, making it nearly impossible for industries to weather the storm, he said.

3,Govt plans workplaces for freelancers to boost exports,"The convenience of freelancers was essential for them to improve their work performance and efficiency, says interim minister Dr Umar Saif.","ISLAMABAD: Caretaker IT and Telecom Minister Dr Umar Saif on Wednesday announced to set up 10,000 e-Rozgar centres across the country to facilitate freelancers as most of them do not have a proper workplace.
“Around 1.5 million freelancers are working regularly in Pakistan,” Dr Saif said in a statement posted on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.
The minister said the convenience of freelancers was essential for them to improve their work performance and efficiency.
“If we can facilitate one million freelancers, their earnings will be enhanced to around $10 billion annually,” he said, adding that with measures already taken including permission to retain up to 50 per cent of their export earnings and easy mode of receiving their payments the freelance activities are expected to grow rapidly.
The IT ministry has identified that the majority of the freelancers belong to smaller cities and towns while the female IT experts are mostly from remote areas where they do not have job opportunities in the relevant field.
While acknowledging that most freelancers do not have the required facilities including a work environment and fast internet in their homes, Dr Saif said that under the new policy the e-Rozgar centres will be equipped with all necessary facilities and each of them will have a capacity of 100 people to work in.
Under the scheme, the owners of buildings who want to get their properties converted to e-Rozgar centres will be granted interest-free loans to convert their real estate into workplaces.
While talking to the media recently the caretaker minister said that the most important aspect of e-Rozgar centres will be the networking and connectivity among the freelancers and the overall atmosphere will support them to go for high-end projects etc.

4,Govt picks just Rs283bn against record bids of R2.8tr,Analysts are sure that the government is waiting for the State Bank’s MPC meeting expe­cted at the end of the current month.,"KARACHI: Investors mainly banks were in a hurry to park a record Rs2.8 trillion in the treasury bills but the government remained cool and accepted only Rs283 billion in the auction held on Wednesday.
Despite a cut in the cut-off yield up to 59 basis points, the investors were willing to invest Rs2.109tr in 12-month papers, Rs76.7bn in 6- and Rs568bn in 3-month tenors.
Market experts found it a clear indication that the interest rate would see a cut in the next monetary policy review. The government had a target of Rs100bn for this auction while the maturity amount was Rs122bn.
The yields on three-, six-, and 12-month pap­ers were 20.99pc, 20.96pc and 20.84pc, respectively.
The government had been raising trillions of rupees through T-bills during the FY24 which substantially increased the domestic debt. 
However, the massive bids provided the government a good chance to raise record-high liquidity but it did not.
Analysts keenly watching the development were sure that the government was waiting for the State Bank’s MPC meeting expe­cted at the end of the current month. Investors sensing a decline in the interest rate placed record Rs2.8tr bids for higher returns. 
Banks are investing in risk-free papers in a highly inflated economy amid an unprecedented interest rate of 22pc.

5,Asia-Pacific jobless rate steady amid falling poverty: International Labour Organisation,Says joblessness and the jobs gap have both fallen below pre-pandemic levels but global unemployment will rise in 2024.,"ISLAMABAD: The International Labour Organisation (ILO) says the unemployment rate in Asia-Pacific is expected to remain constant at 4.5 per cent during 2024-25 in view of the socio-economic developments in low- and middle-income economies of the region as poverty rates have decreased and youth education enrolment improved.  
At around 4.5pc, the regional unemployment rate fell below pre-pandemic levels in 2023, but this figure conceals heterogeneity across countries and age groups, according to the ‘World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2024 Report’ published on Wednesday.  
The unemployment rate is expected to remain constant over the next two years and significantly lower than the spike in 2020 of 5.5pc. It is also lower than the pre-pandemic level — 4.7pc in 2019 — and the long-term average of 5.1pc between 2010 and 2019.  
The report says joblessness and the jobs gap have both fallen below pre-pandemic levels but global unemployment will rise in 2024, and growing inequalities and stagnant productivity are causes for concern.  
Globally, the jobs gap is expected to have numbered 434.8 million persons in 2023, equating to a jobs-gap rate of 11.1pc. This marks a 5.6m decrease in the size of the jobs gap from 2022. Among women, the jobs gap is expected to have been 220.7m in 2023 and, among men, 214.1m.
