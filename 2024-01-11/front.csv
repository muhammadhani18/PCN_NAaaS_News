0,Fazl pledges to revive govt-TTP talks,JUI-F chief meets Afghanistan’s supreme leader,"JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Wednesday met with Afghanistan’s supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada in Kabul wherein it was assured that the next elections in Pakistan would be held peacefully and efforts would be made for the resumption of Islamabad’s talks with the banned outfit Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The Afghan government also demanded that Islamabad would have to play its role in the elimination of Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) as well as chalk out a visa-free policy on the Chaman border alongside a soft plan on the expulsion of its refugees.
Kandahar Governor Mullah Shirin Akhund had promised a meeting of Haibatullah with the JUI-F chief on his visit to Kabul, but declined a huddle with other delegates.
Fazl and Haibatullah discussed the TTP, ISKP, border management, soft visa policy, and refugees during their one-on-one meeting.
The JUI-F chief promised that he would take up the issues of Kabul with the relevant quarters in Islamabad, but pressed the sureties of a ceasefire till peaceful elections in Pakistan, a source said.
The meeting was scheduled by former Kandahar governor Haji Yousuf Wafa. He is currently the governor of the Balkh province.
The source confirmed that Fazl took flight to Kandahar later in the day accompanied by Mullah Idrees and met with some members of the former Quetta Shura.
The overall visit of Fazl will bring a positive impact on the tense relationship between the two neighbouring countries. Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have been simmering for months over Kabul’s failure to stop the TTP-sponsored attacks from across the border.
Soon a short-term ceasefire with the TTP will be announced or there will be an unannounced one between the two sides.
Sources from the delegation also confirmed that a meeting of Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group is also on the agenda.
It has also been learnt that a day might also be added to the unannounced period of the JUI-F chief’s visit to Afghanistan.
Many Afghan Taliban members including those who are in the government have studied from seminaries run by the JUI-F. Observers believe that Pakistan may use the influence of the JUI-F chief to sort out the issue of the TTP.
An 11-member delegation, headed by the JUI-F chief, and including former South Waziristan MNA Maulana Jamaluddin Mehsud, Mufti Ibrar and members from the Haqqani religious seminary, are in Afghanistan since January 7.
Despite repeated attempts, the JUI-F spokesperson, who otherwise had been giving regular updates about Fazl’s engagements in Afghanistan, could not be reached.
The Afghan Taliban chief rarely meets leaders from outside. This was the only second known meeting he held with any foreign leader following his interaction with the Qatari Prime Minister last year.
The meeting could be a turning point in the bilateral ties between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban government. The two governments are at loggerheads over the issue of banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Sources familiar with the development said Maulana Fazl was given a brief and talking points about Pakistan’s stance before he traveled to Afghanistan. The sources said Maulana Fazl was told to convey a clear message to the Taliban chief that Kabul had to choose between Pakistan and the TTP.
The JUI-F chief was also told to inform the Taliban chief that without resolution of the TTP problem bilateral relationship could not move forward.
The Afghan Taliban government has so far not given any indication to take on the TTP. In fact, Maulana Fazl was told during a meeting with the Afghan Interim Prime Minister that the TTP was an internal problem of Pakistan and that it should find a solution from within.
One source, who deals with the Afghan issue, said if this was an attitude of the Taliban government then there won’t be any breakthrough. The source said the Taliban government was well aware that the TTP and its leadership were in Afghanistan. They had the “sanctuaries” and this was also corroborated by the UN and other countries, according to sources.
The JUI-F chief wanted to travel to Kabul to congratulate the Afghan Taliban for their return to power in August 2021 but he could not due to various reasons.
The sources, nevertheless, claimed that the Afghan Taliban, earlier, were not keen to extend him the invitation. Since Pakistan virtually severed high-level contacts with the Kabul regime, the Afghan Taliban decided to invite Maulana Fazl to share its perspective on the TTP and other issues.
Officials are skeptical about any major breakthrough because of the close links between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP. The visit may lower the temperature between the two sides but the prospects of any major headway are slim, according to sources.
Pakistani policymakers would now be waiting for the JUI-F chief’s briefing on his return to know what exactly transpired in his meeting with the Taliban supreme leader.
Some observers see the meeting as a last ditch effort to sort out the issue of TTP.With additional input from Kamran Yousaf in Islamabad

1,Imran given ‘out’ as Nawaz ‘pads up’,Tribunal upholds RO's ruling citing Imran's disqualification under Article 63 (1)(h) of the Constitution,"In a dramatic prelude to the February 8 elections, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday hurdled past objections to his candidacy from NA-130 while incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan faced the sting of rejection on appeals against the dismissal of his nomination papers for two National Assembly seats.
The appellate election tribunals delivered what came as a “double-edged verdict”, granting a clean chit to the Sharif family, including Nawaz Sharif, while quashing appeals by the former premier Imran Khan, former Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Pervez Elahi, along with his wife and son, Moonis Elahi, against the rejection of their nomination papers.
Two separate appellate tribunals upheld the ROs' decision to reject Imran nomination papers.
The PTI’s founding chairman faced the stumbling block – potentially ousted from the electoral battleground – just as the party celebrated the return of its cherished ‘Bat’ symbol.
Meanwhile, the election tribunals also gave the green light to PTI’s Dr Yasmeen Rashid from NA-130, Mian Mehmood ur Rasheed from PP-169 and various other contestants from distinct constituencies by overturning the Returning Officers' decisions that previously rejected their nomination papers.
The election tribunals, in dismissing appeals, affirmed the decision of the ROs to accept the nomination papers of Nawaz Sharif from NA-130, Shehbaz Sharif from NA-132, and Maryam Nawaz from NA-119.
The appellants had contested the ROs' acceptance of their nomination papers.
The tribunals upheld the decisions of the ROs, dismissing appeals lodged by PTI's founding chairman Imran Khan from NA-122, as well as the appeals of PTI's former chief minister Ch. Pervez Elahi, his wife Qaisara Elahi, and their son Moonis Elahi from NA-64, NA-69, PP-32, and PP-34.
The twelve-judge election tribunals of the Lahore High Court (LHC) presided over appeals filed by contestants challenging the acceptance or rejection of their nomination papers by the respective ROs. January 10 marked the final day for appeal hearings.
To address challenges against the election tribunals' decisions, the LHC had initially formed a larger bench comprising five members, including Justice Shujaat Ali Khan, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, Justice Faisal Zaman, and Justice Jawad Hassan.
However, Justice Faisal Zaman withdrew from the bench, and Justice Shujaat Ali Khan was on medical leave during this period.
Following this, LHC CJ Muhammad Ameer Bhatti established a larger three-member bench comprising Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, Justice Shahd Bilal, and Justice Jawad Hassan.
 
Sharif family
An appellate tribunal on Monday had reserved its verdict on an appeal against the acceptance of Nawaz Sharif’s nomination papers from NA-130, Lahore.
Read Tribunal gives clean chit to Sharif family to contest polls
Pakistan Awami Mahaz chief Ishtiaq Ahmad Chaudhry, a lawyer, filed the appeal under section 63 of the Election Act 2017.
The appellant argued that Nawaz could not contest an election due to lifetime disqualification held by the Supreme Court for a person disqualified under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution.
He said the former prime minister was disqualified by the apex court for not being ‘sadiq’ and ‘ameen’ under article 62(1)(f).
In the case of former prime minister and PML-N president, the appellant had challenged RO’s decision of accepting his nomination papers, alleging “he had been identified as the mastermind of alleged criminal attack on the supreme court on November 28, 1997”.
Similarly, the appellant had challenged RO’s decision to accept the nomination papers of PML-N’s Maryam Nawaz on the grounds that she is not ‘sadiq’ and ‘ameen’.
The petitioner objector contended that ROs’ decision to accept her nomination papers from NA-119 was illegal and unlawful.
He cited various TV talk shows where Maryam Nawaz, during a live news segment with anchorperson Sana Bucha, publicly stated that she ""doesn't have any property in London or even in Pakistan.""
However, in a separate statement to anchorperson Sohail Warraich, she declared that she ""owned assets worth about 100 crores."" In addition, in an interview with anchorperson Javed Ch, Maryam
Nawaz's brother asserted that she is the beneficiary of his property in London.
He stressed that Maryam Nawaz has faced convictions in different cases, including the Panama case. Despite her declaration in the nomination papers stating no ownership of property outside Pakistan, her brother had previously claimed that she is a beneficiary of property in London.
He further pointed out that in the 2023 nomination papers, Maryam Nawaz had listed four individuals (Muhammad Safdar, Meheru Nisa Safdar, Muhammad Junaid Safdar, and Mah Noor Safdar) as dependents in her affidavits. However, in 2024, she omitted mentioning her children in the affidavit.
Referring to Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973, which disqualifies individuals not meeting the criteria of being sadiq and ameen from contesting the 2024 elections, he requested the admission of his appeal and the rejection of the nomination papers.
 
Imran Khan
Meanwhile, an appellate election tribunal dismissed PTI's founding chairman Imran Khan's appeal against the RO's decision to reject his nomination papers from NA-122.
The tribunal upheld the RO's ruling, which cited Imran's disqualification under Article 63 (1)(h) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, along with section 232 of the Election Act 2017, due to ""the candidate being convicted by a court of law.""
Furthermore, the RO considered another ground for rejection, stating that ""the proposer of the candidate is not a registered voter in constituency NA-122, as per section 60(1) of the Election Act 2017.""
As for the Pervez Elahi and Moonis Elahi, the concerned appellate election tribunal while announcing a reserved decision dismissed appeals of the PTI’s former chief minister and his son against the orders of ROs wherein their nomination papers were rejected from constituencies NA-64, NA-69 and PP-32 and PP-34.

2,Pakistan ‘not interested’ in talks with TTP,FO spokesperson says Afghan authorities must eliminate terrorist sanctuaries inside Afghanistan," 
 A day after a reported meeting between Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Taliban chief Haibatullah Akhundzada, Pakistan made it clear on Thursday that it had no interest whatsoever in holding talks with the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Pakistani officials also clarified that the visit by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief was a private one, and he was not representing the government of Pakistan.
The statements from the Foreign Office spokesperson and the information minister came against the backdrop of reports that Fazl’s visit might lead to the resumption of talks with the TTP and that he had gone there with the blessing of the government.
In a weekly media briefing, Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, while clarifying Pakistan’s stance, stated that the TTP had accepted responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks in the country.
“First, Maulana Fazlur Rahman is a private citizen, who is visiting Afghanistan on a private visit at the invitation of the Afghan authorities. This is not a visit sponsored by the government of Pakistan,” she explained.
“Secondly, before his travel to Afghanistan, he visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefed him on our policy towards Afghanistan,” the spokesperson added.
“This is a normal practice whenever a senior official or political figure wishes to receive a briefing from the Foreign Office, we provide those briefings.”
However, the spokesperson stressed that Fazl was not visiting Afghanistan as an emissary of the government of Pakistan and that he was there in his individual capacity.
“As far as Pakistan’s position with respect to dialogue with TTP is concerned, we have articulated our position several times and reiterated it in this forum and gathering on many occasions. Our position hasn’t changed,” the spokesperson told reporters.
She went on to say that Pakistan was not interested in dialogue with TTP. “We have no dialogue taking place, nor do we intend to have a dialogue with TTP, which is responsible for several terrorist incidents inside Pakistan and is responsible for killing of Pakistani civilians and law-enforcement officials.”
“Our demands from the Afghan authorities haven’t changed, they remain the same, which is that the Afghan authorities should take action, effective action against terrorist elements inside Afghanistan, including TTP leadership,” according to the spokesperson.
Afghan authorities, she continued, should “ensure that the hideouts and sanctuaries inside Afghanistan for these terrorist groups are eliminated and those responsible for terrorist incidents in Pakistan are handed over to Pakistan”. She said: “Our demand … is that they take action against the terrorists.”
Separately, Information Minister Murtaza Solangi said in a statement there would not be any talks with the TTP. He also said the visit of the JUI-F chief to Afghanistan was private but added that the government would welcome if his engagements in Kabul would bring any positive outcome.
Fazl went to Kabul on Sunday, and on Wednesday he travelled to Kandhar on a chartered plane along with a prominent cleric from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) to meet the Taliban chief. This was the first known meeting between any Pakistani leader and the reclusive Afghan Taliban chief.
Haibatullah Akhundazada, who took over the reign of Afghan Taliban in 2016 after the assassination of his predecessor Mullah Mansur in the US drone strike, rarely meets people from outside. Since the Taliban returning to power in August 2021, the cleric runs the country from Kandahar.
This was only the second known meeting Akhundazada held with any outsider, following his interaction with the Qatari prime minister last year. Even though the JUI-F chief went there in a private capacity but his visit was seen as significant in view of the brewing tensions between the two countries.
Officials said the outcome of the visit depended on what message the JUI-F chief would bring for Pakistan. They added that the Taliban leadership was aware of Pakistan’s concerns and demands and hence unless they come up with a workable solution to the TTP issue, there won’t be any change in Pakistan’s stance.
Tensions have been simmering between the two countries in recent months primarily over the lack of action against the TTP by the Afghan Taliban government.
Even during the visit of Fazl, the Taliban government spokesperson reiterated Kabul’s stance that the TTP was Pakistan’s internal issue, and therefore, it had to find a solution from within. Pakistan, however, does not share the Taliban’s perspective.
Previously, Islamabad shared ‘irrefutable evidence’ of the TTP presence on Afghan soil. Publically, the Taliban government may have been denying the presence of TTP on Afghan soil but privately they have been pushing for the resumption of talks. However, Pakistan is adamant that it would no longer hold talks with the TTP.

3,Would-be CJ’s exit leaves many in shock,Justice Ijazul Ahsan also tenders resignation a day after Justice Naqvi doffs robes," Justice Ijazul Ahsan, who was in line to become the next Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), has tendered his resignation, creating unprecedented times for the Supreme Court.
This comes a day after another like-minded judge, Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar, also resigned. Both judges have submitted their resignations to President Dr Arif Alvi for approval.
""I have had the honor and privilege of serving as a Judge of the Lahore High Court, the Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court, and a Judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
“However, I no longer wish to continue as a Judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Therefore, I, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, resign as a Judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in terms of Article 206(1) of the Constitution with immediate effect,"" said Justice Ahsan in his resignation letter, shocking many.
No one was expecting his resignation. Both judges were regarded as close to former CJ Umar Ata Bandial, and their resignation is also a massive blow to the PTI, which was expecting a revival after Justice Ahsan's appointment as the CJ in October this year.
Now, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah will become the next CJ and serve for more than three years.
After his resignation, incumbent CJ Qazi Faez Isa's position has become stronger within the institution. Since the filing of a presidential reference against Justice Qazi Faez Isa in May 2019, judicial politics have been in full swing, and the SC has remained practically divided into two camps.
Justice Ahsan remained close to three former CJs—Saqib Nisar, Gulzar Ahmed, and Umar Ata Bandial. He was part of several benches that gave controversial decisions.
A debate is underway as to why Justice Ahsan resigned suddenly. It was an open secret that the superior bars were considering moving a complaint of misconduct against Justice Ahsan soon.
Justice Ahsan was already facing severe criticism from the PML-N for his role in the Panama Papers trial, which resulted in the conviction of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz. The PML-N supporters considered him a pro-PTI judge.
Justice Ahsan was a favorite of the establishment led by army chief General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa. However, the incumbent establishment did not trust him.
He led the bench that recommended to former CJ Bandial to take suo motu of a delay in general elections for Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) assemblies. Likewise, he presided over the special bench that declared trials of civilians in military courts as unconstitutional.
Justice Ahsan also authored the judgment in the fake accounts case, where the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had named former president Asif Ali Zardari and his sister Faryal Talpur as accused.
Justice Ahsan was visibly upset over the SC's working after the retirement of CJ Bandial. He was not in favor of live streaming of the SC proceedings and dissented from the majority opinion regarding the endorsement of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
As a member of the committee tasked with the formation of benches, he raised objections to the benches that took up the government's intra-court appeals (ICAs) against SC’s military courts judgment, as well as Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi's petition challenging the misconduct proceedings initiated against him by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
Justice Ijazul Ahsan also objected to the committee formed to give suggestions regarding amendments in the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) rules to improve the procedure for the appointment of superior court judges.
Faisal Siddiqi Advocate said a purge of judges is taking place at the Supreme Court. ""This is, in essence, PCO [Provisional Constitutional Order] by other means. The ultimate objective is to silence dissenting judicial voices. Have no doubt, no judge is safe now,"" he said.
Another lawyer stated that Justice Ahsan's resignation is not only the outcome of judicial politics. Some external elements played their role in securing these resignations, he said.
After the exit of Justice Naqvi and Justice Ahsan, only two judges are left in the SC who were once considered to be part of the CJP Bandial's camp.
Several lawyers believe Justice Ahsan should have faced the challenges. A judge should be prepared to work under pressure, they stated, adding that unlike Justice Naqvi, Justice Ahsan might have gained support from one section of lawyers.
It is also learned that Justice Ahsan resigned after the SJC decided to proceed in Justice Naqvi's case despite his absence. Lawyers are wondering how the SJC is proceeding against a resigned judge. According to a judicial order, misconduct proceedings could not be held against retired or resigned judges.

4,SC to be final arbiter in ‘bat’ acrimony,Court to review ECP’s challenge today; PTI files contempt plea against ECP," 
The Supreme Court will hear the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) plea against the decision of the Peshawar High Court to allot the electoral symbol of the ‘cricket bat’ to the PTI on Friday (today).
On the other hand, the PTI on Thursday filed a contempt plea in the PHC against the ECP for delaying the issuance of the party’s certificate.
A three-judge bench of the SC, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, will conduct the hearing of the ECP’s plea filed on Thursday.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali are also part of the bench.
Earlier, the SC registrar office had returned the ECP’s plea raising the objection that various pages of the application could not be read.
A day earlier, the PHC annulled the ECP’s ruling revoking the PTI’s cherished electoral symbol, citing irregularities in the party’s internal polls.
In its short order, the high court declared that the electoral body’s order was “illegal, without any lawful authority and of no legal effect”.
The court also instructed the ECP to publish the certificate submitted by the PTI after its internal polls on the commission's website.
In its contempt plea filed by the PTI in the PHC, the party named Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, ECP secretary, and commission’s members Justice (retd) Ikram Ullah Khan, Nisar Ahmad Durrani, Babar Hassan Bharwana, and Shah Muhammad Jatoi as respondents.
The plea was filed by lawyers Qazi Muhammad Anwar and Shah Faisal Ilyas.
The petition read that the commission’s action to delay the issuance of the PTI’s certificate was considered contempt of court as it hindered the party’s regular electoral process as evident from the PHC’s “explicit instructions”.
“[The] respondents disregarded the order of this honourable court and downgraded the authority of this honourable court. That omission of respondents to act upon the order of this honourable court speaks of the fact that respondents undermined the authority of this honourable court,” the plea read.
The PTI, after earlier submitting an application regarding the allotment of its electoral symbol to the SC, withdrew it on January 10.
The apex court dismissed the petition on grounds that it was withdrawn.
Talking to the media after meeting PTI founding chairman Imran Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, the incumbent chief of the party Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the commission had the right to move the SC against the PHC order, but the party was sure that it would receive justice from the top court as well.
He added that the PTI’s electoral symbol stood restored until the SC made a decision on the ECP’s plea.
The PTI chairman said the ECP should abide by the court’s order and fulfil its responsibility of conducting free, fair and transparent elections.
Speaking on other matters, Gohar said party tickets would be announced by Thursday night.
He added that the PTI would begin issuing tickets soon.
