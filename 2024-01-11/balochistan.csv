4,‘Animal rights pivotal to society’,Experts bemoan animal abuse for entertainment,"Renowned wildlife and animal behaviour expert, Dr Ijaz Ahmed, emphasised the imperative need to not just consider the well-being of animals as a moral obligation but as a fundamental right within our society.
He asserted that animals, like humans, experience pain and deserve to have their intrinsic rights acknowledged. In a call for a societal mind-set shift, he urged the public to recognise the emotional capacity of animals and their right to coexist in human societies with dignity and respect.
However, it’s disheartening to witness the widespread use of animals for entertainment, particularly in circuses and amusement parks. Expressing concern over the gradual disappearance of animal biodiversity in Pakistan, Dr Ahmed highlighted the alarming consequences of depleting jungle cover. As these natural habitats diminish, countless species face the threat of losing their homes.
He further said that the diminishing jungles also result in a decline in biodiversity, particularly affecting Pakistan’s aquatic ecosystems. He emphasised the necessity of protecting aquatic animals, underscoring the importance of preserving their habitats for the benefit of future generations.

As diverse species face a decline, he underscored the urgency of educating the younger generation so as to instil a sense of responsibility in them. Additionally, he emphasises the need to preserve natural habitats and establish wildlife sanctuaries as crucial steps towards conserving Pakistan’s rich and diverse wildlife.
A prominent animal rights activist, Anees Jilani, urged for a comprehensive overhaul of Pakistan's antiquated animal rights laws to align them with contemporary societal values. The existing laws, such as the 1890 Act under which the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) have proven ineffective and are in desperate need of reform.
Anees Jilani shed light on some key provisions of the outdated act, emphasising that it criminalises cruelty to animals, including baiting or inciting animals to fight. He said that there was a dire need to resuscitate the neglected laws.

5,Pindi’s very own ‘iron-man’,Old man builds 70-year-long career with coal-powered iron,"The ironing machine is an essential household item which serves as a basic necessity in every home. However, Sher Muhammad of Patiala still runs his business by taking it upon himself to iron people’s clothes with his hand-crafted coal-powered iron at a nominal fee.
It can be said that iron plays an important role in shaping people’s personality and surely, no one prefers to leave the house wearing clothes lined with creases. However, ironing can be a time-consuming task that may prove a challenge, especially in the case of smoothing out clothes fashioned from different kinds of fabric.
This is where Sher Muhammad comes in. A 75-year-old man from Patiala near Saidpuri Gate – the densest area of Rawalpindi – makes both ends meet by using a charcoal iron to provide ironing services to locals of the area and has been doing so for the past 70 years.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Sher Muhammad said “Our forefathers belong to Patiala, and we used to live in Saidpuri Gate before Pakistan was founded.”
He says before the creation of Pakistan, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims were living happily in one neighbourhood. “When the movement for Pakistan started, the desire for a separate homeland arose in our hearts. I participated in the movement,” he elaborated while sharing his life story.
Sher Muhammad explained that in the earlier days Kartarpura, Saidpuri Gate, Bhapara Bazaar, Haripur, and Bagh Sardaran were areas within old Rawalpindi that had central status. In these areas, resided the famous traders.

Hindu and Sikh traders mostly wore white clothes and shawls and warm woollen clothes in the winter, while women used to wear silk, banarsi and cotton sarees. He said, “When I started my service, I used to iron shalwar kameez for one rupee.”
My iron was made of a block of iron worth Rs200, he said adding that irons like these are no longer manufactured and coal has also become expensive. “Now I charge Rs100 to iron a pair of shalwar kameez. I iron the clothes of twenty-five houses in the neighbourhood and I have raised my children with the help of this iron,” he exclaimed.
Sher Muhammad has three children. His eldest son has died, while two of his children work hard to run the household. His children are the ones who pay the ironing store’s rent which costs Rs5,000 per month.
In the past, clothes were ironed on special occasions such as Eid or other festivals. However, people are now in the habit of regularly ironing clothes and they prefer to use an ironing machine made of iron. The main reason for this is that the weight of a machine made of iron helps press and smooth out fabric so that it gives the cloth a sheen of its own.

7,Rs40m heist triggers police jurisdiction spat,Seven armed bandits loot 40 cattle traders near Rawalpindi-Chakwal border region with impunity,"At least seven armed robbers snatched Rs40 million from 40 cattle traders on a bus near Rawalpindi and Chakwal border on Wednesday.
According to the police, the robbers held the cattle traders hostage at gunpoint for about 45 minutes in the moving bus and got away with their money.
After the incident was reported, a boundary dispute arose between the Rawalpindi and the Chakwal police. Later, the issue was resolved with the intervention of senior officers and a case was registered. The affected traders demanded the Punjab chief minister take notice of the incident.
A traders, Daniyal, informed the Jatli police team over the phone that the incident occurred when over 40 traders were on their way to the Lahore cattle market via the Peshawar Motorway in public transport. 
However, due to fog near the Balkasar Interchange, the Motorway police diverted the bus from the motorway towards the Sohawa, Chakwal GT Road.
The report stated that as soon as the bus covered some distance, seven robbers with pistols and a Kalashnikov in a car signalled to stop the bus. 
As the robbers got into the vehicle, they asked the bus driver to keep moving, took all the cattle traders hostage at gunpoint, thrashed and beat them up and robbed them of their money.

The affected traders said that they had reported the incident to Rescue 15, on which a preliminary report was lodged at the Jatli police station, Rawalpindi. The police also visited the crime scene, inspected the bus and directed all the affected traders to reach Jatli police station. 
When the victims reached the Jatli police station, the police officials said that the incident on GT Road did not take place in the limits of Rawalpindi district but in Chakwal district, therefore, the traders should go to Chakwal and get their report registered there.
The affected traders were standing outside the Jatali police station in the bitter cold and were in distress by the indifference of the police. 
The traders demanded that action should be taken by taking notice of the improper behaviour of the police.
The Rawalpindi Police spokesman said that the robbery incident took place in the Dhok Amb area of Chakwal district.
However, the Jatli police had rushed to the spot after receiving the information about the incident but after investigation, they found out that the area falls within the limits of Chakwal. The case of the incident will be registered by District Chakwal police.
