• PHC overrules Election Commission order on PTI’s intra-party polls, says party entitled to its symbol
• CEC chairs post-decision huddle; will finalise strategy after briefing from law wing
ISLAMABAD / PESHAWAR: After the Peshawar High Court (PHC) overruled a decision of the election watchdog which denied the PTI its electoral symbol of ‘bat’, the Election Com­mission of Pakistan (ECP) will hold another meeting today (Thursday) to decide whether or not to move the Supreme Court against the order of the high court, which came hardly a month before the general elections slated for Feb 8.
On Wednesday, after another round of ‘bat-and-forth’ in the PHC, the PTI was allowed by the two-member bench to retain its electoral symbol and the decision of the ECP announced on Dec 22 was set aside.
 
 

After the PHC ruling, ECP chief Sikandar Sultan Raja chaired a huddle in Islamabad to take stock of the situation in the aftermath of the court decision.
A source said the meeting mulled over its options, but could not reach a final decision about whether or not to approach the top court. Another meeting will be held today (Thur­s­day), where the law wing of the ECP will brief the watchdog, after which a final decision about moving the SC will be made.
A source, however, agr­eed that time was quite short as returning officers are expected to allocate poll symbols to the contesting candidates on January 13.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan hailed the PHC verdict as “historic”. Speaking to the media in Rawalpindi, he said that the ‘bat’ was more than just an electoral symbol.

According to Mr Khan, the PHC’s verdict was a crucial step in ensuring free and fair polls. He criticised the ECP, claiming it attempted to thwart the PTI on all fronts, which had resulted in denying the party’s right to retain its symbol and potentially losing 227 reserved seats, reported Dawn.com.
He highlighted the potential consequences, saying that 807 PTI candidates for general seats would have been forced to contest polls as independents, which would have led to corruption. He argued that no constitution permitted the withdrawal of an electoral symbol from any political party and insisted that only the PTI was being targeted.
PTI lead counsel Barrister Syed Ali Zafar told media persons that it would be contempt of the high court if the ECP did not forthwith publish on its website the certificate of PTI’s intra-party polls and allot the party its election symbol.
PHC proceedings
“The ECP is directed to forthwith publish the certificate [of intra-party polls] filed by the petitioner on its website in terms of section 209 of the Elections Act, 2017,” the bench consisting of Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Syed Arshad Ali said in a brief order.
According to the court, the PTI was entitled to the election symbol “strictly in terms of sections 215 and 217, read with any other enabling provision of the Elections Act 2017 and Election Rules 2017”.
Following the PHC order, PTI workers were elated, several of whom were wielding cricket bats and raising party slogans on the premises of the high court.
The bench on Wednesday mostly heard arguments advanced by lawyers representing six of the respondents, who had challenged the PTI intra-party polls before the ECP.
 
 

Advocate Qazi Jawad Ahsanullah appeared for Yousaf Ali and stated that his client was a former general secretary of the PTI in Swabi who wanted to participate in the polls, but was not provided the opportunity by the party. Qazi Jawad contended that the intra-party polls were for the entire country, whereas the high court’s territorial jurisdiction was limited to this province.
The bench inquired why the matter could not be agitated before this high court when the polls were held in Peshawar and were declared void by the ECP. The counsel put forward different orders of the superior courts about the jurisdiction of a high court, arguing that the high court could only review provincial matters whereas the intra-party polls were held for the entire country.
Justice Ijaz Anwar asked whether the party should have moved all four high courts.
The bench inquired whether the ECP could take action of not allotting a symbol under Section 215 of the Elections Act if the intra-party polls were not held in accordance with Section 208 of the law, as the said action could only be taken due to the violation of Section 209, dealing with the submission of the polls certificate by the political party.
Advocate Mian Azizuddin Kakakhel appeared for Raja Tahir Nawaz and Raja Hamid Zaman, both belonging to Islamabad, whereas advocate Fida Bahadur represented Sardar Niaz Ahmad from Abbottabad. They also supported the ECP’s order stating that the polls were not held in accordance with the law and constitution of the party.
Rebutting their arguments, Barrister Ali Zafar stated: “Neither the Elections Act 2017 nor the Constitution or any other law in the field allows the ECP to nullify the intra-party elections of a political party.”
He argued that the court had the jurisdiction to adjudicate on this issue since the polls were held in Peshawar.
ECP counsel Sikander Bashir Mohmand argued that being a regulator it was the responsibility of the commission to look into the intra-party polls of a party when it submits a certificate under Section 209 of the Elections Act.
He added that if the polls were not held in accordance with the party constitution the ECP could take action under Section 215. He was of the opinion that for every general election, symbols were allotted to a political party and after completion of polls, the symbols do not belong to any particular party.

1,Tribunals turn down Imran’s appeals on two NA seats,RAWALPINDI / LAHORE: The appellate tribunals of the Lahore High Court on Wednesday dismissed the appeals of...,"RAWALPINDI / LAHORE: The appellate tribunals of the Lahore High Court on Wednesday dismissed the appeals of imprisoned former prime minister Imran Khan, who had challenged the rejection of his nomination papers from two National Assembly constituencies — NA-89 in Mianwali and NA-122 in Lahore.
The returning officers (RO) of both constituencies had rejected Mr Khan’s nomination papers mainly on the grounds of being convicted in the Toshakhana case. The officer for NA-122 also ruled that Mr Khan’s proposer was not a voter of the constituency.
The appeal regarding Lahore’s constituency was heard by the tribunal of Justice Tariq Nadeem at the principal seat, while a tribunal of Justice Chaudhry Abdul Aziz decided the appeal about Mianwali’s constituency at the Rawalpindi bench.
“I have no scintilla of reluctance to hold that the returning officer was legally competent to examine the candidature of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi (appellant) while subjecting his nomination papers to scrutiny on the touchstone of Section 62 of the Elections Act, 2017,” Justice Aziz observed in his written verdict.
The tribunal rejected an argument by Mr Khan’s counsel that the appellant’s conviction could not be considered after the suspension of his sentence. The judge observed that conviction and sentence were two different terms as conviction pertained to the guilty verdict and sentence stands for the rigours following conviction.
He emphasised that conviction meant a guilty verdict pronounced by a court in reference to the delinquency attributed to an accused, whereas the sentence denoted the quantum of punishment.
According to Justice Aziz, Mr Khan’s counsel had filed the petition seeking the suspension of his client’s sentence under section 426 of the CrPC; therefore, his conviction was intact even though the sentence was suspended.
The judge dismissed the appeal and observed that the RO of NA-89 rightly rejected Mr Khan’s nomination papers. The tribunal at the principal seat in Lahore did not immediately issue a written verdict. A lawyer for the PTI founding chairman argued that the Toshakhana case conviction was not a hurdle in his way to contest the upcoming general election.
He said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was not a court and the conviction in the Toshakhana case did not amount to disqualification under Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution.
He said the sentence of the appellant had already been suspended by the Islamabad High Court. To the objection of the proposer and seconder of the appellant not belonging to the same constituency, the counsel said the ECP changed delimitation after issuance of the election schedule.

2,"No let-up as three cops, two soldiers martyred in KP","Militants use sophisticated weapons in Kohat attack on policemen; two sepoys martyred, two militants killed in Lakki Marwat.","• Militants use sophisticated weapons in Kohat attack on policemen
• Make off with two AK-47s, Rs100,000 from Lachi toll plaza
• Two sepoys martyred, two militants killed in Lakki Marwat
KOHAT / LAKKI MARWAT /PESHAWAR: Four people, including three police officers and a civilian, lost their lives in a militant attack on a police checkpoint near the Lachi toll plaza on the Indus Highway in Kohat district on Wednesday morning.
According to police sources, nearby CCTV footage showed militants approaching the post, swiftly executing a police officer inside, and then attacking two others with a grenade.
“The first policeman embraced martyrdom inside the checkpoint,” District Police Officer (DPO) Kohat Farhan Khan told Dawn. “A militant later lobbed a hand grenade at two police personnel standing at a distance from the checkpoint who also embraced martyrdom.”
 
 

A civilian, mistakenly targeted as a police officer due to his black dress, was also killed in the assault, Mr Khan said.
Senior police officials reported that the militants also made off with two AK-47 rifles and around Rs100,000 from the toll plaza. The crime scene evidence suggested the use of a submachine gun and an American-made M-16 in the attack.
Following the attack, heavy contingents of law enforcement agencies, including the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), reached the spot and initiated a comprehensive search operation. However, the militants managed to escape into the nearby mountainous terrain under cover of darkness.
The victims’ bodies were transported to the Kohat Development Authority Teaching Hospital for autopsy.
A funeral service was held at the new police lines, attended by high-ranking officials, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police chief Akhtar Hayat Khan, General Officer Commanding of IXth Division Maj Gen Zulfiqar Bhatti, Kohat Commissioner Abid Khan, DIG Sher Akbar Khan, and others, along with families of the martyrs and community members.
 






The martyred soldiers were laid to rest in their ancestral hometowns with full honours.
Talking to journalists, the KP police chief said that non-state actors were involved in militant activities, adding that all law enforcement and intelligence agencies were trying their best at the cost of their lives to identify and arrest militants.
He said the forces were on the highest alert to foil the nefarious designs of anti-state elements, adding that they were active in parts of Karak and Hangu districts and had frequently targeted police posts on Parachinar and Rawalpindi highways in southern KP using ultra-modern weapons.
Later, chairing a high-level meeting after the funeral, the KP police chief said the militants were targeting police and army officials and expressed the resolve to continue the fight until militancy is eradicated and peace is restored in the country.
He said police and armed forces in Lakki Marwat and Waziristan had been targeted by militants through improvised explosive devices and gunfire.
He vowed that the security forces would not rest before wiping out all the sinister elements trying to spread anarchy through different means by fanning division in society based on linguistic, religious and political differences.
Lakki Marwat attack
Meanwhile, two security personnel were martyred and two militants were killed in an exchange of fire in the Arsala area of Lakki Marwat district on Wednesday.
The incident occurred in a rural locality as security forces were conducting a patrol. They unexpectedly encountered the terrorists, leading to a sudden and intense exchange of fire.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) confirmed the encounter and the casualties on both sides.
According to the ISPR, the security forces effectively targeted the militants’ position, resulting in the death of two militants identified as Aftab alias Malang and Masood Shah.
“These terrorists remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces as well as target killings of innocent civilians. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from them,” the ISPR read.
The two soldiers who lost their lives were Sepoy Muhammad Afzal, 29, from district Bhimber, Azad Kashmir, and Sepoy Ibrar Hussain, 27, from district Mansehra.
Following the clash, a sanitisation operation was launched in the area to ensure the elimination of any remaining terrorists, the ISPR said. “Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” it said.

3,Poll candidate shot dead in KP; one hurt in Turbat attack,Independent candidate among 3 killed in targeted attack; PML-N's ex-senator Mir Aslam Buledi injured in Turbat assault.,"NORTH WAZIRISTAN/QUETTA: An independent election candidate from the provincial assembly constituency PK-104 was gunned down along with his two companions in a targeted attack in the Mir Ali area of North Waziris­tan district on Wednesday, police officials said.
The candidate, Malik Kalimullah Dawar, was targeted when he was travelling back to his home in the Tapi area along with Masroor Khan and Muha­m­mad Sakhi. Police said their car came under fire by unidentified assailants and the three individuals died on the spot.
Sources said this was not the first assassination atte­mpt on Malik Dawar, as he had survived multiple such incidents in the past.
 
 

The latest attack occ­u­r­red in the same area where the vehicle of former lawmaker and National Democratic Movement (NDM) Chairman Mohsin Dawar had been shot at during an election campaign just last week.
Mir Aslam Buledi injured
Meanwhile, Mir Aslam Buledi, a senior nationalist politician and PML-N’s candidate for the National Assembly constituency NA-258 (Turbat-Panjgur), was critically wounded in an armed assault in Tur­bat town on Wednesday evening.
Mr Buledi, a former senator and provincial agriculture minister, was attacked during his evening walk in a local park. The attack was carried out by unidentified gunmen on motorcycles who opened fire on Mr Buledi using an AK-47 automatic rifle before fleeing the scene.
“The former senator received four bullets,” Hassan Jan Bloch, the Kech deputy commissioner, said, adding that police and security personnel rushed to the site and shifted the injured PML-N candidate to Turbat Teaching Hospital for immediate medical care.
Given the severity of Mr Buledi’s injuries, arrangements were being made to transfer him to Karachi for advanced treatment, Mr Baloch said.
No individual or group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
Mir Aslam Buledi recently joined the PML-N during the visit of party supremo Nawaz Sharif and other leaders to Quetta. Mr Buledi was awarded the party ticket for NA-258.
Previously a member of the National Party, Mr Buledi had been elected as a senator and MPA but had remained largely inactive in politics in recent years. He is the father-in-law of PPP leader Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi, a provincial assembly candidate from Turbat.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Ali Mardan Domki, provincial ministers and leaders of political parties strongly condemned the attack on Mr Buledi and described it as a “terrorist attack”.
 






Mr Domki has sought a report from the Home Department and directed officials of law enforcement agencies to take all possible steps to arrest the assailants.
“The attackers would be brought to justice soon and the government would take all steps for the protection of all candidates taking part in the upcoming elections,” the chief minister said. He said the provincial government was making all-out measures to hold elections peacefully.

4,Judge facing Supreme Judi­cial Council inquiry calls it a day,"“I feel relieved,” Justice Mazahar Ali Naqvi tells Dawn.","ISLAMABAD: In a surprise move and just a day before the Supreme Judi­cial Council’s (SJC) schedu­led proceedings in the matter, Justice Sayyed Maz­ahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, who was facing complaints of mis­conduct, tendered his re­signation as a judge of the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
The resignation came a day after a three-judge SC bench rejected a request to stay the Jan 11 SJC proceedings against him.
“I feel relieved,” Justice Naqvi told Dawn when approa­c­­h­ed to confirm reports that he had resi­gned.
Hailing from Gujran­wala, Justice Naqvi was elevated to the Supreme Court on March 16, 2020.
“It is a hard reality that I was totally denied the rig­ht of audience,” Justice Naq­vi regretted. He poin­ted out that he had moved 24 applications, but not a single one had been decided.
“The chairman and other judges were reluctant in providing me an opportunity of hearing except one,” he claimed, adding: “Rest had joined consolidated design. There was no fun (sic) to expect any administration of justice,” he regretted.
“In the circumstances which are a matter of public knowledge and to some extent public record, it is no longer possible for me to continue to serve as a judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan,” the judge said in his resignation letter to President Dr Arif Alvi, a copy of which was also sent to the SC’s registrar.
“Consideration of due process also compels so. I, therefore, effective today resign as a judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan,” the letter said, adding it was an honour to be appointed and to serve as judge first of the Lahore High Court and then as the Supreme Court.
Typographical error

Since the date in the resignation letter was mistakenly written as Jan 10, 2023, the personal secretary to the judge later issued a corrigendum to the secretary to the President, stating: “Today ie Jan 10, 2024, Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, judge Supreme Court of Pakistan, has tendered his resignation from the office of judge, Supreme Court of Pakistan, and the resignation letter has been sent to the President.
“However inadvertently the date of the letter was written as 10th of Jan, 2023 instead of Jan 10, 2024,” the corrigendum said, adding the judge has desired that being a typographic mistake, the same may be corrected and recognised as Jan 10, 2024, and the quarters concerned may be informed accordingly.
The resignation instantly triggered a debate as to what will become of the reference pending before the SJC and whether after the resignation the judge would continue to enjoy perks and privileges like pension and other benefits.
Perks, privileges
When the question was put to a senior counsel, he explained that after resignation judges are entitled to enjoy all the perks and privileges, including pension. Likewise, the reference after the resignation becomes infructuous and ideally the proceedings by the SJC should come to an end, the counsel said, seeking anonymity.
But former Supreme Court Bar Association president Muhammad Akram Sheikh was of the view that the resignation cannot stop the SJC from continuing its inquiry into the judge’s alleged misconduct and restoration of the wealth allegedly amassed by him to the public exchequer.
“In my view… Justice Naqvi cannot claim pension or any ancillary benefits from the high office he has vacated after finding no hope of survival with dignity,” Mr Sheikh alleged.
Therefore, he said, he expects the SJC would not discontinue the inquiry and allow the judge an honourable acquittal from the charges levelled against him as the same will open floodgates of corrupt practices and misconduct in the superior judiciary.

5,Musharraf’s sentence for treason upheld posthumously,"CJP-led bench overturns LHC verdict; lawyers’ bodies, PPP hail judgement","

Pervez Musharraf

 
ISLAMABAD: A four-member bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the death sentence awarded by a special court to the late military dictator Pervez Musharraf in 2019 for high treason.
“In the given circumstances when no legal heir of the late Musharraf was before the court, we have no option but to hold that his appeal against the conviction will abate and consequently the conviction of the special court will subsist,” observed Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa in a judgement dictated in Courtroom No.1.
The bench had taken up a set of appeals against the Jan 13, 2020, Lahore High Court (LHC) order declaring unconstitutional the special court order of awarding death sentence to Gen Musharraf as well as his appeal against the Dec 17, 2019 death sentence awarded by the latter. In a split decision, the special court had handed a death sentence to the former military ruler, finding him guilty of high treason under Article 6 of the Constitution.
CJP Isa, heading a four-judge bench, also set aside the Jan 13, 2020, Lahore High Court (LHC) order as not sustainable. The detailed reasons will follow later.

CJP-led bench overturns LHC verdict; lawyers’ bodies, PPP hail judgement

In its decision, a three-judge LHC bench consisting of Jus­tice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti, and Justice Chaudhry Muhammad Masood Jahangir had held that the trial of Gen Musharraf in absentia was illegal, unconstitutional, and repugnant to injunctions of Islam, as well as Articles 2A, 8 and 10-A of the Constitution.
During the hearing, the Supreme Court noted that the appeal was filed by Gen Musharraf but he had not surrendered himself to the court since the court was told on his behalf that he was indisposed abroad and therefore not in a position to appear before the court.
Senior counsel Salman Safdar, who earlier represented the convict, informed the court that on Feb 5, 2023, his client passed away and despite best efforts, he could not establish contact with the legal heirs. He said the legal heirs had lost their interest in the case due to an inordinate delay in the taking up of the appeal.
On Nov 10 last year, the court provided an opportunity to the counsel to again try to establish contact and even issue notices to the legal heirs of the deceased and also issued notices through leading newspapers in the country and abroad, but to no avail.
On Nov 28, the Supreme Court framed questions to consider whether after the death of the appellant, his appeal would not abate under Section 431 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and if the sentence was upheld by the apex court, what consequences would it entail for his legal heirs, such as the rights, pensions and other pecuniary benefits. The counsel explained that he had sent out several messages to reach out to the legal heirs but did not receive any response.
Though not obliged, in the interest of justice the Supreme Court also issued notices at the addresses, but that too remained an exercise in futility.
Consequently, the counsel conceded that since no one had approached the court, let alone engaged the counsel, the appeal before the court would abate.
‘Decision appreciated’
Although there was no immediate public reaction from Gen Musharraf’s family, the legal fraternity and a handful of political parties issued statements endorsing the verdict.
Soon after the announcement of the judgement, Pakistan Bar Council Vice Chairman Haroonur Rashid and chairman of its executive committee, Hassan Raza Pasha, appreciated the decision.
In a statement, they said the deceased was guilty of high treason under Article 6 for subverting the Constitution twice, first on Oct 12, 1999, and then on Nov 3, 2007, when he imposed the emergency and held the Constitution in abeyance.
They demanded that the federal government initiate the case under Article 6 against delinquents and those responsible, who violated Article 5 of Constitution.
In a statement, the Pakistan Peoples Party also hailed the decision, with Farhatullah Babar saying the restoration of the special court verdict will be remembered as historic for its great symbolic value.
“Gen Musharraf is already dead and he cannot be hanged for treason...[but] the adventurer who hijacked the Consti­tution has been judicially pronounced as traitor and punished, even if symbolically, by that very Consti­tution which he had trampled with contempt.”
The verdict “will strike terror in the hearts of all would-be adventurers waiting in the wings”, he said.
