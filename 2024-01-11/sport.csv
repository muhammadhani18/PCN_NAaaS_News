0,Fakhar says resting  top players will help prepare back-up,"""I feel lucky that I’m still in the team even though I don’t have a place as an opener,” says Fakhar.","AUCKLAND: Pakistan batter Fakhar Zaman has suggested that resting the side’s regular T20 openers Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam will help the side test new players and prepare back-up for the future.
The duo’s position at the top of the order is a matter of debate since the past few months, among not only fans but in the national side’s team management circles as well.
With a number of impressive top-order batters coming through Pakistan’s domestic cricket system, Babar and Rizwan — who have partnered each other for more than 2700 runs in 56 T20Is after being — have their places under scrutiny.
The pair might be separated to test the likes of Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan and even Fakhar — originally an opener who had been coming down at number four in T20Is to accommodate Rizwan and Babar — at the top of the batting line-up in Pakistan’s five-match series against New Zealand, which starts on Friday.
While Pakistan chief selector Wahab Riaz — who included a number of new faces in the Pakistan squad for the away series — had already hinted at resting regular players to give playing time to the less experienced ones, Fakhar reiterated his stance on Wednesday.
“It’s not very easy to replace players like Babar and Rizwan,” Fakhar said during a press conference. “ […] but giving rest to them may help with preparing a back-up.“
The New Zealand series will mark the commencement of Pakistan’s build-up towards this year’s T20 World Cup, which is set to be held in the United States and the West Indies in June. The national side is scheduled to play a host of T20 matches before the showpiece.
“.. in the 15-20 matches before the World Cup we should give testing new players a chance, so that no new player has to play directly [in the World Cup],” said the flamboyant batter.
Fakhar said he was happy to play at number four for Pakistan, and that not playing as an opener, despite being established in the slot in domestic and franchise T20s and One-day Internationals, was “not a sacrifice” for him.

“The management and the captain want me to play lower down the order, which means they believe I can win matches from that position,” he said. “This is the national team and a lot of players want an opportunity. I feel lucky that I’m still in the team even though I don’t have a place as an opener.”
The T20Is against New Zealand will be pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi’s first assignment as the Pakistan captain in the format. The left-armer has won two Pakistan Super League (PSL) titles in a row for Lahore Qalandars.
Fakhar, Shaheen’s Qalandars team-mate, said the bowler had proved his mettle as the leader in the franchise scene and that he expected him to emulate his aggressive approach in the international arena as well.
“I’ve seen Shaheen groom himself as captain,” he said. “He proved a lot of people including myself wrong that he is not good enough as a captain.
“There’s a difference between leading a franchise and the Pakistan team, but he has great leadership qualities.”
Both Pakistan and New Zealand will be almost full strength through the course of the five matches, the last of which will be played on Jan. 21. Fakhar believed that it would bring competitiveness into the series, especially with the T20 World Cup on the horizon.“.. we are facing their main strength bowling for the first time,“ the Mardan-born southpaw said of New Zealand. “And we want that because this is the year of the World Cup, so we want to play against strong teams.
“… the big guns like Lockie Ferguson, Kane Williamson, they’re really good players, and we are looking forward to playing against them.”

MOHALI: Star Indian batsman Virat Kohli will miss the first of three T20 Internationals against Afghanistan due to “personal reasons”, coach Rahul Dravid said on Wednesday.Kohli and skipper Rohit Sharma both returned to the T20 squad after more than a year’s absence for the series starting on Thursday in Mohali, as the teams prepare for the T20 World Cup in June.
“Virat will miss the first game due to personal reasons,” Dravid said at a press conference.
“He will be playing from the second and third T20.”
Kohli and Rohit last played a T20 International in November 2022, when India lost to England in the semi-final of the T20 World Cup in Australia.
The second T20 will be played in Indore on Sunday with the final match in Bengaluru on Jan 17.
INJURED RASHID OUT OF THE SERIES
Meanwhile, Afgha­nistan skipper Ibrahim Zadran said leg-spinner Rashid Khan will miss the T20 series against India due to an injury, but added that the tourists have plenty of experience in reserve. 
Rashid, a bowler with 347 international wickets across formats, underwent lower-back surgery in November but remains part of the travelling squad which will play the opener on Thursday.
“He is not totally fit [but] he is travelling with the team. We hope he gets fit soon,” Zadran told reporters.
“Without Rashid we will struggle but not that much. His experience is important for us but this is cricket, you should be ready for any kind of situation.”
Rashid, 25, is a pillar of a world-class Afghan spin attack that also includes Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Noor Ahmad and Mohammad Nabi.
“Playing against India on their home soil is a difficult task, but we came here to play well against them and show our skills,” said Zadran.
“We have lots of good T20 players, all our boys are playing good cricket, so I am sure they will play well.”
The cricketing minnows put up an impressive show in last year’s ODI World Cup in India with victories over England, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Netherlands.
Zadran, a 22-year-old opening batsman, said fans’ added expectations will motivate the team to elevate their performance.
“Not only Afghanistan people are expecting lots of things, but all around the people are expecting [a] lot of things from us nowadays, because we played a wonderful World Cup,” he said.
Zadran said the team hoped to “play positive cricket and show our skills on the field”.—AFP

2,Huge gains from sale of HBL PSL broadcast and live streaming rights,"Meanwhile, Zaka Ashraf has said both the PCB and Cricket Australia have agreed to increase their cooperation in all departments of the game.","LAHORE: In an encouraging development for the game, the HBL Pakistan Super League has fetched 113 and 45 per cent increase from the sale of live streaming and broadcast rights for the 2024 and 2025 editions of the event.
Zaka Ashraf, the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Interim Management Committee, said this during a media conference here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday. At the presser, Zaka was flanked by PCB chief operating officer Salman Naseer and PSL commissioner Naila Bhatti.
The PCB chief said that the credit for the considerable gains from sale of the streaming and broadcast rights went to the bid teams which also featured representatives of the PSL franchises.
“Ninety-five per cent of the total income of the PSL is to go to the six franchises. Therefore, all the franchises are also happy over the huge increase which will also attract other investors to join the league in future,” the PCB chief said while congratulating the successful bidders on becoming partners of the HBL PSL brand.
Unfolding the details about the bids, Naila said keeping in mind the current financial situation of the country, the PCB was afraid of not getting appropriate response but it was a good day for the PCB that both the rights sold out by making a record increase.
“The response for the media rights in the first round was not [that] healthy. However, in the second round ARY offered around Rs7 billion bid and it was declared successful among the four contenders,” Naila said.
The PCB, on the sale of PSL broadcast and live streaming rights, issued a press release on Wednesday. 
“HBL Pakistan Super League had yet another historic day on Tuesday, when its live-streaming and broadcast rights saw an increase of 113 and 45 per cent for the 2024 and 2025 editions, respectively,” read the PCB news release.
“ARY Communications (Pvt) Limited (ARY) submitted the highest bid, pursuant to a public tender process, to broadcast HBL Pakistan Super League 2024 and 2025 in Pakistan, which sees a whopping increase of 45 per cent from the value for the last two years.
“Bids were received from Independent Media Corporation Pvt. Ltd (IMC – the parent company of GEO Entertainment Television Pvt Ltd), ARY Communications (Pvt) Limited (ARY), Pakistan Television Corporation Limited (PTVC) and Tower Sports (Ten Sports).
“Meanwhile, Walee Technologies submitted the highest bid, pursuant to a public tender process, to live stream HBL Pakistan Super League 2024 and 2025 in Pakistan, which sees a huge increase of 113 per cent from the value for the last two years,” the release added.
“The PCB received bids from five parties — Consortium of ARY Communications (ARY, Myco, Daraz and Tamasha), Walee Technologies, TransGroup FZE, Independent Media Corporation Pvt. Ltd (IMC — the parent company of GEO Entertainment Television Pvt Ltd) and Tower Sports (Ten Sports).
“The PCB Bid Committee has recommended the highest bids submitted by ARY and Walee Technologies to the competent authority for approval.”
PCB, CA TO ENHANCE COOPERATION
Meanwhile, Zaka said both the PCB and Cricket Australia (CA) had agreed to increase their cooperation in all departments of the game.
In this regard, Zaka said, CA would soon get the approval of its Board to sign an agreement with the PCB.
Zaka, who visited Australia recently during Pakistan senior team’s Test tour to the country, said while it was a hard fact that Pakistan suffered a 3-0 clean sweep Down Under but added that “the new agreement to be signed between the two boards, will help players of both the countries play better in future, while touring each other”.
“According to the new understanding developed between the two boards, U-19, ‘A’ sides and women teams of both the countries will tour each other on an annual basis,” Zaka disclosed.
“When players of the Shaheens [A’] and the U-19 teams also make their places in the national team, they will no longer be be stranger to the playing conditions in Australia.
“It is the first step to prepare a strong [national] team for the tour of Australia which can deliver there in a better way.”
To a question, Zaka said the IMC had been summoned and after forming the Board of Governors, the elections of the PCB chairman for the next three years would be held. The IMC meeting will be held in Karachi on Jan 16.
Talking about the development of cricket infrastructure in the country, Zaka said Pakistan Army had offered the PCB to build stadiums in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) areas of different cities. Moreover, he said, the Punjab government was ready to hand over some cricket venues to the PCB.
Meanwhile, Salman said the CA would also help the PCB in preparing curators and groundsmen under a comprehensive programme.

3,Smith to replace Warner as opener in Tests against West Indies,SYDNEY: Steve Smith will open the batting alongside Usman Khawaja in the forthcoming home Test series against the...,"SYDNEY: Steve Smith will open the batting alongside Usman Khawaja in the forthcoming home Test series against the West Indies in place of the retired David Warner, Australia selectors said on Wednesday, with all-rounder Cameron Green coming in at number four.
Warner bowed out of Test cricket the weekend after the last Test against Pakistan in Sydney, having been a fixture at the top of the order for 12 years.
Recognised openers Cameron Bancroft, Marcus Harris and Matt Renshaw were long seen as the main contenders to fill the role, until Smith last week said he wanted to do the job.
“There were plenty within the team who were pretty keen to go on record and say that they weren’t keen to do it,” chief selector George Bailey told reporters.
“So it was refreshing that Steve had come forward and said he wanted it and it was something that we’d been chatting about in the background as a selection panel with the coaches as well.
“It’s selfless that someone who has had so much success in one position or a couple of positions in the middle order is open and willing and hungry to have a crack at something new and something different.
“Steve will be opening the batting and Cameron Green will be coming into the number four position which is fantastic,” Bailey added.
“Steve’s motivated and energised and keen to do it.
“It’s a challenge for him, it’s something ... he thinks he can do. It’s an itch he’d like to scratch and ultimately for us, as a team, it’s something that fits.”
The series starts at the Adelaide Oval on Jan 17 before moving to the Gabba in Brisbane from Jan 25.
The highly-rated Green has been sidelined recently by a resurgent Mitchell Marsh, who has assumed the all-rounder role.
Shifting Smith up the order, rather than opting for a specialist opener, allowed selectors to bring Green back primarily as a batsman.
“The way the rest of that batting order is functioning left us feeling like we have someone who we think is pretty talented, who potentially was going to find it hard to get any Test cricket in the next period,” Bailey said of Green.
“I don’t think that’s going to be particularly beneficial for Greeny. We can get a lot of benefits out of him playing.”
Renshaw was handed a Test lifeline as the only change in a 13-man squad for the two-Test series starting on Jan 17 in Adelaide, leaving Bancroft and Harris out in the cold.
His inclusion is a big blow for Bancroft, who is the leading run-scorer in Sheffield Shield over the last two seasons. But at 27, Renshaw is four years younger.
Whether pace spearheads Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc, who played all three Tests against Pakistan, can back up for another two is another unknown.
If selectors decide to rest one of them, Boland will step in.
Meanwhile, selectors also named a 13-man squad for the ODI series against the West Indies that follows the Tests, with Cummins rested and Smith taking over as captain.
Marsh, Starc, and Hazlewood will also sit out the three games.
Western Australia bowler Lance Morris received his first call-up in the 50-overs format, while Jhye Richardson, who last played an ODI against Sri Lanka in 2022, returns to the squad. Marcus Stoinis, part of Australia’s World Cup-winning squad in India, misses out.
Test squad: Pat Cummins (captain), Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchel Marsh, Matt Renshaw, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc 
ODI squad: Steve Smith (captain), Sean Abbott, Nathan Ellis, Cameron Green, Aaron Hardie, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Lance Morris, Jhye Richardson, Matt Short, Adam Zampa.

4,Rybakina and Pegula dig deep to stay alive in Adelaide,The Russian-born Kazakh will face either Veronika Kudermetova or Ekaterina Alexandrova for a place in the semi-finals.,"ADELAIDE: World number three Elena Rybakina overcame Cristina Bucsa in two hard-fought sets to make the quarter-finals of the Adelaide International on Wednesday, while fifth-ranked Jessica Pegula and Jelena Ostapenko had to work even harder to make the last eight. 
Coming off the back of crushing Aryna Sabalenka to lift the Brisbane International title on Sunday, top seed Rybakina prevailed 6-3, 7-5 against Spaniard Bucsa though the scoreline does not quite reveal how intensely they fought producing 90 minutes of high-quality tennis. 
Rybakina broke Bucsa in the eighth game, which was just enough for the Kazakh to secure a tight opening set in the Australian Open warm-up event. 
Bucsa fought tooth and nail but her failure to convert any of the four break points that came her way cost her the set. 
Rybakina began the second set by breaking her opponent but it was not to be a cakewalk for the top seed. 
Bucsa finally converted a break point en route to a 4-3 lead but Rybakina somehow managed to dominate the big points and sealed her victory with an ace. 
“I think she played really well today,” Rybakina said of her opponent. “I didn’t start that quick with the movement and everything but I think she played really well, especially coming forward, which you don’t see much in women’s tennis. It was a bit surprising for me, but yeah, happy that I managed to win.” 
The Russian-born Kazakh, aiming for a deep run at the upcoming Australian Open, will face either Veronika Kudermetova or Ekaterina Alexandrova for a place in the semi-finals. 
Second seeded Pegula battled back from a set down to overcome lucky loser Bernarda Pera 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 in an all-American clash. 
Pegula looked ill at ease against Pera’s powerful left-handed game in the opening set and converted only one of her 10 break point chances. 
But she found her feet in the second set to draw level and after nosing ahead by a break at 4-3 in the third she then saved five break points for a crucial hold. 
Her sixth break in the next game vanquished Pera, setting up a quarter-final against 2021 French Open finalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Thursday. 
“I stayed relaxed and tried not to get frustrated. I want to keep improving and have a good mindset,” said Pegula. “It’s a brand new year and I want to find my confidence for the Australian Open.” 
Pegula has made the quarter-finals at the Australian Open in each of the past three tournaments. 
Pavlyuchenkova defeated Katerina Siniakova 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 to keep her tournament hopes alive. 
Former French Open champion Ostapenko had an injury scare before overpowering Caroline Garcia 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals and will next play Ukraine’s Marta Kostyuk. 
Leading 5-4 in the opening set of what turned out to be a hitting contest, Ostapenko took a medical timeout after complaining of sharp pain in her left thigh. 
She returned to secure the set but Garcia forced the decider with her spirited comeback in the second. 
Ostapenko, playing with a strapped thigh, broke her opponent in the opening game of the third set and made her fourth match point count to prevail in two hours and 41 minutes. 
Laura Siegemund, part of Germany’s United Cup winning team, advanced past Romanian Ana Bogdan 6-4, 7-5 with either Anna Kalinskaya or Daria Kasatkina awaiting her in the last eight. 
In men’s action, top seed Tommy Paul scored an emphatic 6-3, 6-2 win against qualifier Alex Bolt, while fellow American and third seed Sebastian Korda saw off a stiff challenge from Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 7-6 (12/10). 
They will play Briton Jack Draper and Australian Chris O’Connell respectively in the quarter-finals. 
“The first match of the year, you never really know what to expect,” said Paul. “I was obviously working pretty hard in the past two months, but you can’t recreate the feelings that you have on court. So I was happy to get out there and play some good tennis.” 
Draper came through a marathon, battling for 3hr 39min before finally advancing against Serb Miomir Kecmanovic 5-7, 7-6 (11/9), 7-6 (9/7). 
Chilean second seed Nicolas Jarry also needed more than three hours to topple Italian Matteo Arnaldi 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, saving a match point in the second-set tiebreak. 
In contrast, O’Connell cruised past Russia’s Alexander Shevchenko 6-3, 6-1 in 60 minutes. 
At the Hobart International, another tune-up event for the Melbourne Park Grand Slam, top seed Elise Mertens powered into the last eight with a 6-2, 6-3 thrashing of the Slovak Republic’s Anna Karolina Schmiedlova. 
She will face Arantxa Rus next after the Spaniard swept past France’s Varvara Gracheva 6-2, 6-3. 
Qualifier Yuan Yue, who stunned former US Open champion Sloane Stephens on Tuesday, maintained her strong run with a 7-5, 6-3 upset win against fourth seed Wang Xinyu. but fifth seed and 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin crashed out.

5,"Abid, Asif star in President’s Trophy; Irfan impresses",KARACHI: Abid Ali’s century and Asif Afridi’s five-wicket haul have turned the President’s Trophy clash ...,"KARACHI: Abid Ali’s century and Asif Afridi’s five-wicket haul have turned the President’s Trophy clash between Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGPL) and Wapda into an evenly poised contest.
The performances from the seasoned duo came on the second day of the first-class tournament’s fifth-round, which also featured matches between Higher Education Commission (HEC) and Pakistan Television (PTV) and Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
Abid’s 147 off 183 — a knock featuring 14 fours and three sixes — helped SNGPL post 292 in response to Wapda’s first-innings total of 328-6.
But the veteran right-hander’s innings was the only show of resistance coming from his side as Wapda spinner Asif recorded figures of 5-124.
Asif’s fellow spinner Khalid Usman took 4-89, before Wapda ended the day at 64-1 in their second innings.
At the State Bank Stadium, HEC added 120 runs to their overnight score to post 231-8 in their stipulated 80 overs. PTV, in response, scored 122-2 as opener Hasan Nawaz smashed 59 off 75 (five fours and two sixes).
Starting their day at 28-2, SBP managed 194 at the National Bank Stadium after KRL had scored 269 on the first day. The major chunk of SBP’s total was down to Irfan Khan’s unbeaten knock off 91 off 124 — the innings featuring eight fours and four sixes. 
Left-arm spinner Umer Khan took three wickets for KRL, who were worse in their second innings, as they closed the day at 101-7. They could have been in a more difficult position had it not been for Maaz Sadaqat’s 42 not out off 68.
The lower-order batter will be key for KRL, when they come in to bat on the third day.
Scores in brief: 
SNGPL vs WAPDA at UBL Sports Complex 
WAPDA 328-6 in 80 overs (Ahmed Shehzad 77, Ayaz Tasawar 75, Mohammad Saad 45 not out, Muhammad Akhlaq 41; Mubasir Khan 3-67, Mubasir Khan 3-67, Mohammad Awais Anwar 2-56, Kamran Ghulam 1-23) and 64-1, 20 overs (Ahmed Shehzad 43 not out, Muhammad Akhlaq 21 not out; Shehzad Gul 1-8); SNGPL 292 in 73.3 overs (Abid Ali 147, Kamran Ghulam 41, Asad Shafiq 25; Asif Afridi 5-124, Khalid Usman 4-89)

6,"PSG ‘best club for Mbappe’, says president Al-Khelaifi",PARIS: Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said on Tuesday that he wants Kylian Mbappe to stay in the...,"PARIS: Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said on Tuesday that he wants Kylian Mbappe to stay in the French capital, claiming PSG is  “the best club for him”.
Mbappe’s contract with the Ligue 1 champions runs out at the end of June and he is free to sign an agreement to join a new club for next season.
“I’m not going to hide that I want Kylian to stay,” Al-Khelaifi told broadcaster RMC. “The best player in the world is Kylian and the best club for him is Paris.”
PSG have yet to win a maiden Champions League title despite spending billions of euros on transfer fees since the arrival of their Qatari owners in 2011.
Mbappe has been heavily linked with a possible move to 14-time European champions Real Madrid.
“He has the best training centre in the world, the best coach in the world [Luis Enrique],” said Al-Khelaifi.
“Every year he’s sure of playing in the Champions League, we’re in the last 16 at least, quarter-finals, even semi-finals or final, we’re there with the big clubs.”
A source involved in Mbappe’s contract negotiations told AFP last week that the France forward had waived bonuses totalling  “several tens of millions” of euros in a bid to ease a move away from PSG.
Mbappe signed a contract extension in 2022 which secured him a salary of 72 million euros ($78.7 million) per year, a signing bonus of 150 million euros and a loyalty bonus which rose from 70 million euros in year one to 90 million in year three, according to Le Parisien.
But Al-Khelaifi insisted whether Mbappe stays or not  “is not a question of money”.
“We have a lot of very important matches, I ask for you to leave Kylian alone, leave him alone.”
Mbappe has scored 24 goals in all competitions for Ligue 1 leaders PSG this season.

7,Middlesbrough shock Chelsea to take League Cup semi lead,MIDDLESBROUGH: Chelsea suffered a surprise 1-0 loss at second-tier Middlesbrough in the first leg of their League ...,"MIDDLESBROUGH: Chelsea suffered a surprise 1-0 loss at second-tier Middlesbrough in the first leg of their League Cup semi-final on Tuesday with Hayden Hackney’s goal giving Mauricio Pochettino’s wasteful side plenty to do in the return. 
The 21-year-old Hackney’s silky finish from an Isaiah Jones pass stunned the visitors in the 37th minute at the Riverside Stadium and the hosts defended superbly to take a slender advantage to Stamford Bridge. 
Chelsea only had themselves to blame though as they dominated possession but squandered a host of chances — the biggest culprit being Cole Palmer who failed to hit the target twice in the opening half with the goal gaping. 
Boro, who won the trophy in 2004 but are currently 12th in the Championship, had chances on the counter-attack to increase their lead but will still head to London believing they can reach Wembley. 
Chelsea have lost five of their last six away games and 21 times on the road since the beginning of last season — the most of any Premier League team. 
Their players were booed by some of their own fans at the final whistle with Thiago Silva acting as peacemaker but they will be confident of making amends in the second leg on Jan. 23. 
Chelsea’s stuttering first season under Pochettino has been a case of one step forward and two back and Tuesday was a prime example of the problems they face as they were unable to beat Michael Carrick’s injury-ravaged Boro. 
They had 18 goal attempts, the majority in the first half, but once again they lacked quality in front of goal and were often exposed in defence. “We made some mistakes in the first half and gave them chances to score,” Pochettino told Sky Sports after his side’s ninth defeat of the season in all competitions. 
“After that they were aggressive and played with a deep block and it was hard for us to break them down. But we have another 90 minutes and we need to be positive. 
“If we assess the performance overall we were the better side, had clear chances, but we didn’t score and weren’t clinical. It happened a lot this season.” 
For former Manchester United and England midfielder Carrick, and a raucous home crowd, it was a special night. 
Carrick could have been forgiven for cursing his luck after losing top scorer Emmanuel Latte Lath to injury after just three minutes. He was also forced to withdraw Alex Bangura inside 20 minutes but the second-tier side were not fazed. 
“It’s very special,” Carrick said. “I know it’s a two-legged affair and there is still all to play for, but for what we’ve had to go through, the injuries, the setbacks we’ve had, to beat a team of Chelsea’s quality is unbelievable. It was an exceptional effort.” 
Middlesbrough had not scored against Chelsea for over 17 years. The Blues had won the past nine meetings by an aggregate score of 21-0. 
However, the home side ended that drought eight minutes before half-time when the lively Jones did superbly to latch on to a long pass and bamboozle Chelsea left back Levi Colwill before squaring for Hackney to guide the ball past Djordje Petrovic from close range. 
Chelsea, though, should have at least been level but Palmer sliced over from in front of goal after Boro keeper Tom Glover failed to gather a shot by Enzo Fernandez in first-half stoppage time. 
And Palmer was denied again before the halftime whistle, this time taking too long to shoot and then firing too close to Glover who had a superb game. 
Chelsea monopolised the ball in the second half but lacked the guile to break down Boro’s red wall. 
Middlesbrough conceded late to lose 1-0 to Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round on Saturday. 
But this time the team that sit 12th in the Championship held out to keep their dreams of a Wembley final against either Liverpool or Fulham very much alive heading into the second leg.

Lamichhane, 23, was once the poster boy for cricket in Nepal and the leg-spinner’s on-field success had boosted the sport’s profile in the Himalayan republic.
In 2022, he was accused of raping a young woman in a Kathmandu hotel but was freed on bail and returned to the squad to compete in international tournaments.
He was convicted of rape in December after a repeatedly delayed trial that had left him free to continue his sporting career, with his sentence handed down on Wednesday.
“The court has sentenced him to eight years,” Kathmandu district court official Ramu Sharma told AFP.
He was also ordered to pay a court fine of 300,000 Nepalese rupees ($2,255) and a further 200,000 rupees ($1,500) to the victim  “considering the mental impact” his attack had on her.
Lamichhane, who is not in custody, was not in court for the sentencing.
His lawyer, Saroj Ghimire, told AFP he  “will appeal the decision in a higher court”.
The victim had said she was a minor when she was raped, but the court in a previous ruling said that she was 18.
Lamichhane consistently denied the charge against him and enjoyed strong public support despite the accusation.
When authorities issued an arrest warrant, Lamichhane initially failed to return from Jamaica, where he was playing in the Caribbean Premier League.
He was dismissed as national captain and arrested, but Nepal lifted his playing ban after he was freed on bail.
This allowed him to remain on the national team, including for the World Cup qualifiers and the 2023 Asia Cup. Hundreds of cheering cricket fans welcomed him when he first returned to the field in February last year.
But his continued playing career has also sparked anger and caused numerous Nepalis to disavow the team. Scotland’s cricketers refused to shake hands with him after their matches during an international tournament in Dubai.
Cricket does not enjoy the same adulation in mountainous Nepal as it does elsewhere in South Asia. But it has been growing in popularity, with Nepal given ODI status by the world governing body in 2018.

Bologna defender Stefan Posch fired their fifth penalty over the bar before Fiorentina midfielder Maxime Lopez converted to send last year’s finalists through.
Bologna, who knocked out holders Inter Milan in the last 16, had more possession but were unable to break the deadlock.
The visitors went close in the 34th minute when striker Joshua Zirkzee hit the bar from close range before winger Riccardo Orsolini struck the post after the break.
But Fiorentina, fourth in the Serie A standings on 33 points, one point ahead of fifth-placed Bologna, held firm in defence before reaching the semi-finals for the third straight year for the first time.
They will next face the winner of the match between AC Milan and Atalanta, in a two-legged semi-final in April.

The American world number 16 reached the quarter-final of the Australian Open, the last four at the US Open and secured a first ATP title in Tokyo in his first full season on tour in 2023. 
But the 21-year-old ended his campaign with first-round exits in Vienna and Paris, before another first-up loss last week in Brisbane. 
“It was definitely a tough match playing against Fabian,” said Shelton after getting past the world number 65 Marozsan in 71 minutes. “I had a tough win against him last year at a Challenger tournament. So really cool to have a match-up first against him, he’s a great player. It was a fun match but happy to get through it.” 
Shelton, who sent down 10 aces, faces a quarter-final on Thursday against Spaniard Roberto Carballes Baena, who beat Austrian seventh seed Sebastian Ofner 7-5, 6-3, one of four seeds to tumble out on Wednesday. 
Third-seed Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina was thrashed 6-1, 6-1 by France’s Alexandre Muller and eighth-seeded Australian Max Purcell lost 6-2, 6-4 to Japan’s Taro Daniel. 
Fourth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada lost his first singles match of the year 7-6 (11/9), 7-5 to German Daniel Altmaier. 
Second-seeded Briton Cameron Norrie survived a scare from French teenager Luca Van Assche, winning 6-3, 6-7 (6/8), 6-1. 
Norrie’s quarter-final will be against Chilean qualifier Alejandro Tabilo, who got past Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp 7-5, 6-3. 
Arthur Fils, who ended Richard Gasquet’s title defence on Tuesday, swept aside Nuno Borges 6-2, 6-0 in 52 minutes to storm into the last eight.

12,"Al-Attiyah, Quintanilla dominate Dakar dunes to clinch stage 5","SHUBAYTAH: Five-time winner Nasser Al-Attiyah posted his first win of this year’s Dakar Rally on Wednesday,...","SHUBAYTAH: Five-time winner Nasser Al-Attiyah posted his first win of this year’s Dakar Rally on Wednesday, clocking the quickest time in the Empty Quarter dunes between Al-Hofuf and Shubaytah in Saudi Arabia.
The 53-year-old Qatari, driving for Prodrive, finished 1min 51sec ahead of Toyota’s Guerlain Chicherit to claim his 48th stage win in the Dakar and moved second in the standings, gaining two minutes on cars leader Yazeed Al-Rajhi, who finished fourth behind Argentinian Juan Cruz Yacopini.
“There was no strategy on my part,” said Al-Attiyah who will now have to open the road at the start of the ‘48H chrono’, a new two-day stage across Thursday and Friday.
“I wanted to win the stage no matter what they have in store for us tomorrow. It’s 600 kilometres long and I don’t mind opening the road. Even if I lose time, what matters to me is finishing these 600 kilometres.”
Sebastien Loeb (Prodrive) tried his luck by deliberately missing a compulsory checkpoint, a  “mistake” that cost him a 15-minute penalty.
As a result, he finished 21min 13sec down the order, giving up time in the overall standings in the hope of optimising his chances in the ‘48H Chrono’ by starting from behind.
Ross Branch reclaimed the lead in the bikes category after Chilean rider Pablo Quintanilla dominated the dunes to win stage five.
On a short 118km special stage, Quintanilla was pushed all the way as he completed his seventh Dakar stage win, beating his Honda team-mate Adrien Van Beveren by just 37 seconds.
“After two awful days, everything fell into place,” said Quintanilla. “I went flat out. It wasn’t easy because the glare of the sun made it hard to see the tracks but I went 100 percent from the first kilometre. It was tough, but I managed to set a fast pace and had a great stage.”
Two-time winner Toby Price (KTM) completed the podium at 1min 39sec.
Honda’s other Chilean Ignacio Cornejo had a difficult day in the saddle.
After his stage four victory on Tuesday, which had give him the overall lead, he had the difficult task of opening the special and finished 6min 11sec down on his compatriot.
That allowed Botswana’s Ross Branch (Hero), who came sixth on the stage, to retake the lead in the provisional overall classification, 1min 14sec ahead of  “Nacho” Cornejo. The American Brabec is third in the standings at 3min 47sec.
