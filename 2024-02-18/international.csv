0,PPP urges SC to take notice of Pir Pagara’s statement,"Khuhro condemns Pir Pagara's statement, alleging that it unjustly implicates judiciary and constituted slander","Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has urged the judiciary to take notice of the remarks made by the Grand Democratic Alliance's (GDA) leader, accusing them of supporting a potential coup. 
Speaking at the press conference in Hyderabad on Saturday, PPP Sindh President, Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, brought the Supreme Court's attention to the statement made by GDA chief Pir Pagara Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi.
Khuhro quoted Pir Pagara as suggesting that the judiciary might endorse an emergency or martial law, which he deemed as a looming possibility. 
Pir Pagara also predicted a short duration for any coalition government formed by PPP and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), estimating it to last no longer than eight to ten months.
Khuhro condemned Pir Pagara's statement, alleging that it unjustly implicated the judiciary and constituted slander. ""By advocating for martial law, Pir Pagara is violating Article 6 of the constitution,"" Khuhro asserted. 
He further criticised Pir Pagara for abstaining from the election campaign, accusing him of remaining inactive while GDA candidates canvassed without their leadership.
Accusing GDA, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) of attempting to instigate chaos in the country, Khuhro referenced past remarks by PTI leader Imran Khan about using nuclear weapons.

He argued that GDA and JUI-F leadership similarly sought to pave the way for martial law due to their electoral losses.
Khuhro emphasised that Pakistan cannot afford another undemocratic regime, citing PPP's decision to support a PML-N candidate for prime minister as a move towards restoring stability. 
He clarified that PPP's support would not entail joining the federal government, but, would support democracy.
Speaking of the sit-in protests by GDA and JUI-F, Khuhro noted that these parties did not receive a mandate from the people of Sindh in previous elections. 
He questioned the absence of protests in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), where JUI-F lost previously held constituencies, unlike in Sindh.
Khuhro criticised the disruption caused by the parties' blockades of highways and motorways in Sindh, highlighting the adverse impact on ordinary citizens.

3,Gas shortages continue to disrupt cooking,Unannounced outages of cooking fuel during the winter have complicated the preparation of meals within households,"During the winter season, people require a stable supply of gas not only for cooking purposes but also for heating their homes in a cost-effective manner however, for citizens in the coastal city of Karachi, plagued by incessant gas outages, even the routine task of preparing basic meals and hot beverages in the kitchen requires much patience and effort.
Nadia, a homemaker residing in a flat at the Rashid Minhas Road shared her struggle to prepare meals given the sporadic spells of gas loadshedding. “Since the onset of the winter season gas is unavailable for almost 16 to 20 hours a day. Not only is the supply cut off through the night, it is also stopped throughout various times of the day,” said Nadia.
Concurring with Nadia, Farida, a resident of Surjani Town, and Sahar, a resident of Liaquatabad, both revealed that the unannounced closure of gas, had disrupted their cooking schedules and eating habits.
“Many a times our children have to go to school hungry since there is no gas before 8am in the morning,” lamented Farida.
“When our LPG cylinders run out, we have no choice but to purchase bread, and tea from the hotel, which is very costly,” added Sahar.
Seconding Sahar, Ali Suhail, a finance officer at a firm, said, “People are already suffering due to inflation and limited financial resources. When there is no gas at night, people have to line up at the hotel and buy bread.”
Asif Raza, a hotel owner, confirmed Suhail’s observation, when he reported receiving a large influx of customers, who could not prepare bread at home due to the gas outage. “We are also using LPG stoves at our hotels, due to which the cost of bread has increased,” revealed Raza, who further added that due to the increase in demand for LPG, commercial cylinders were booked by hotels a week in advance.

“At present, apart from domestic consumers, most of the food manufacturers are running their business on LPG. Since, natural gas reserves are depleting rapidly, in the next two to three years, it is estimated that 90 percent of Karachi’s domestic consumers will shift to LPG,” predicted Masood Khan, a local distributor of LPG.
“Due to the increasing demand, some profiteers are selling LPG from Rs270 to Rs300 per kg informed Irfan Khokhar, chairman of the LPG Distributors Association, who implored the government to formulate a strategy for making LPG more affordable in the coming years.
According to Mohammad Owais Ashraf, an expert in the energy sector, a lot of investment is needed in the energy sector for discovering new gas reserves. “At present, natural gas reserves are decreasing rapidly therefore, circular debt in the gas sector has to be reduced,” opined Ashraf, who stressed on the importance of resolving the country’s energy crisis for future generations.
However, Abdul Sami Khan, Chairman of the All-Pakistan Petroleum and CNG Dealers Association believed that energy projects initiated by the government usually failed to reach completion. “In 1990, an environment-friendly energy project was launched to reduce the consumption of petroleum, by switching a large number of vehicles to CNG. However, the Pak-Iran Gas Pipeline Project could not be completed due to various reasons, and we used up our natural gas reserves mercilessly. Now the situation has become such that gas is also disappearing for domestic consumers,” highlighted Khan.
“Since the demand for gas during winters exceeds its supply, the gas load management plan has to be implemented,” claimed an official from the Sui Southern Gas Company.

5,Prices of vegetables soar in Hyderabad,Vendors attribute hike to transport issues due to protests,"The prices of vegetables has skyrocketed in Hyderabad, with officials struggling to curb profiteering activities across the city. 
Despite a notice from the deputy commissioner, there has been no reduction in the price of broiler chicken meat. Vegetable vendors attribute the price surge to transportation disruptions caused by ongoing protests.
Profiteers have raised the prices of various vegetables from Rs100 to Rs.150 per kg. This sudden increase led to heated verbal clashes between vendors and buyers at different locations on Friday. 
For instance, the price of red and green tomatoes, sold at Rs60 a day ago, surged to Rs150 per kg. Onions, previously at Rs200 per kg, now range between Rs220 to Rs.230. Tori, sold at Rs100 per kg, reached Rs180 per kg, and okra rose by Rs80 to Rs300 per kg.

Bell peppers, which were Rs150 per kg, increased by Rs130, reaching Rs.280 per kg. Indigenous garlic rose from Rs300 to Rs700 per kg, while green chili increased from Rs.120 to Rs160 per kg. Brinjal surged by Rs90 to Rs150 per kg, and gourd, which was Rs60 per kg, jumped to Rs240 per kg. New potatoes are sold at Rs50 per kg, while old potatoes are unavailable even at Rs100 per kg.
Vegetable sellers attribute the scarcity to transport issues on Friday, causing prices to rise due to the shortage. The increased prices led to a significant decrease in vegetable sales on Friday, with citizens opting for lower-priced options. 
Deputy Commissioner Tariq Qureshi noticed the surge in chicken meat prices and directed assistant commissioners to take immediate action.
