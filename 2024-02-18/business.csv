The meeting scrutinized various aspects of potential sites for the economic zones. Participants were briefed in detail about the feasibility studies conducted by consultants for establishing new economic zones in the newly merged districts. The session included discussions on site sketches, possibilities, and utilities associated with the proposed zones.
Considering diverse priorities, the meeting reached a consensus to establish two zones in two districts. It was decided that these zones should be set up in areas where there are no industrial estates managed by the Small Industries Development Board (SIDB) or economic zones operated by the economic zones development company. This strategic approach aims to maximize benefits for the local population of these regions.
