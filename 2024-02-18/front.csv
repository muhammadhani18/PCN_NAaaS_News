0,Only fair polls can define CJP Isa’s legacy,SC not taking suo motu notice of Pindi commissioner’s claim that top judge was involved in rigging,"The Supreme Court is so far showing restraint and not taking suo motu notice of the Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chatha’s allegation that Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa was involved in rigging this year’s general elections.
It has been learnt that no meeting of top court judges were held.
However, senior SC judges informally consulted among themselves after the Rawalpindi commissioner’s claim.
Some of them suggested taking suo motu notice of his allegation and the matter should be scheduled before a larger bench for adjudication but this proposal was turned down.
Later, CJP Isa talked to some media personnel at the SC premises, wherein he expressed his surprise over the “baseless” allegation levelled by the Rawalpindi commissioner.
Former additional attorney general (AAG) Tariq Mahmood Khokhar believed that the commissioner’s unsubstantiated assertions against the CJP were despicable and ludicrous.
He added that the CJP’s extra-judicial public comments to the media were “gratuitous” and did not constitute an authoritative or judicial ruling.
“Therefore not much should be read into this,"" he continued.
Khokhar said his personal view was that judges should remain insulated from the public controversies.
“Judicial silence would perhaps have been more appropriate.”
He further explained that the causality of the Rawalpindi commissioner’s rant against the CJP had its roots in the judicial decisions involving the PTI electoral symbol of the ‘cricket bat’ as well as its founding chairman Imran Khan’s several successive criminal convictions and custodial sentences.
""There is a perception among a significant part of the nation that historically, the Supreme Court has been and remains a threat to democracy.""
Although the SC did not take a suo motu notice, a three-judge bench, led by CJP Isa, will take up a former military officer’s petition seeking a declaration that February 8 general elections were rigged and urging for a fresh round of the polls.
Now a debate is under way as to whether or not CJP Isa should be a part of the bench hearing the plea on polls rigging.
Lawyer Shoaib Shaheen, who contested the recent elections as a PTI-backed independent candidate, has also written a letter to CJP Isa about the alleged rigging in his constituency.
Senior lawyers believed that the SC should order a probe into the allegations of rigging in the elections.
Since the time of the British rule, districts including Attock, Chakwal, and Jhelum in Rawalpindi have been recognised as significant sources of military recruits, with soldiers hailing from these areas participating in both the world wars.
Moreover, even after the Partition, a majority of young people from these regions have shown a preference for joining the armed forces of Pakistan.
In the 2018 general elections, the PTI celebrated victories in the majority of the National Assembly seats in the Rawalpindi division and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), as the PML-N lost all of them in these areas.
However, the February 8 general elections brought a surprising turn of events, with the PTI failing to retain any seats in this historically significant region.
Allegations of massive rigging in the final results have already been raised by the PTI-backed independent candidates, particularly concerning the issuance of Form 47 by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
Many candidates have argued that the results indicating their victories had been collected through Form 45, distributed by presiding officers to their agents after the counting at polling stations.
Interestingly, a majority of PTI candidates in these districts enthusiastically celebrated the unofficial results on the night of February 8.
However, the scenario took a turn when the returning officers (ROs) issued Form 47, showing the defeat of PTI-backed independent candidates and declaring PML-N contestants as successful in these constituencies.
The PTI-backed candidates are alleging that they were denied entry into the ROs' offices during the counting process.
Legal experts believed that the SC became controversial after its January 13 order wherein the PTI’s internal polls were declared as illegal and the party was deprived of its popular electoral symbol.
Now the PTI is struggling to secure its mandate and allocation of reserved seats on account of the SC’s January 13 order.
The PTI candidates were consistently complaining about not being given a level playing field to them during the elections but their grievances were not addressed.
Even after the January 13 order, the PTI was disappointed and withdrew its contempt petition over the violation of the court order for providing a level playing field to the party.
PTI founding chairman Imran was awarded convictions in three cases within a week.
There are serious doubts on the fairness of Imran and his wife Bushra Bibi’s trials in the Toshakhana reference and Iddat case. The former premier and PTI vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s jail trial in the cipher case is also dubious.
According to Article 225 of the Constitution, election disputes can exclusively be addressed by tribunals but this process is time-consuming.
Furthermore, with the current accusation of widespread rigging, the tribunals will only address individual cases.
The crucial factor determining the legacy of CJP Isa lies in the conduct of free and fair elections.
While he played a role in ensuring that the general elections were held, questions have arisen about the fairness of the process.
The superior judiciary has been on trial since the Panama Papers case -- with lingering doubts about political leaders receiving convictions during periods of strained relationships with the ‘powerful circles’.

1,PML-N dragging feet on govt formation,Some PML-N leaders said the party is not ready to get blackmailed on agreeing to any unconstitutional demand,"The PML-N is apparently dragging its feet on forming a government in the center despite the alleged assurances by the PPP-P, the second largest party in the National Assembly, of unconditional support. However, the party has also not given any hint about a possible change of hearts with regard to leading the future coalition government at the federal level.
“We have offered the PML-N time and again to form a government in the Center but they are deliberately delaying it. I don’t understand why the PML-N is doing so,” said a PPP-P leader after the third meeting between the two parties held to decide terms and conditions of a possible alliance on Saturday.
Responding to speculations that the PPP-P was still demanding that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto should be made the prime minister, he said “such a thing has not been discussed at all in the meetings”. He said the PPP-P has even declined the PML-N’s offer to lead the government after two and a half years.
“We have been saying PML-N is the majority party in NA and it should form the government,” he said, adding “PPPP is still ready to give vote to the PML-N’s candidate for the PM’s slot.” Additionally, he reiterated that PPPP is not yet interested in becoming a part of the upcoming federal government.
He said the PML-N has yet to respond to the PPP-P’s other proposals, including its demand that the office of the president should be given to the PPP-P along with the office of Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker.
Another PPP-P leader confirmed that the PPP-P has not demanded a prime ministerial position for Bilawal, saying the party is sticking to its “principle position” and arguing on the points that Bilawal and PPP-P President Asif Ali Zardari have already shared in their recent press talks.
He, however, rejected the impression that the matter was being dragged on, stating that both the sides would consult with their leadership and meet on Monday again. “Things are expected to reach a conclusion by Monday.”
Both the PPP-P leaders refrained from sharing specifics, saying they were under oath. Several leaders of the PML-N were also approached for comments but no one was available.
Meanwhile, a joint declaration issued after the coordination committees of both parties met in Islamabad stated that detailed discussions took place regarding government formation.
It added that significant progress was made on various issues; however, the two sides decided to sit again on Monday to finalize matters.
“The proposals put forth by both parties were thoroughly discussed, and while substantial progress was achieved, further deliberations are required to finalize the matters at hand,” the joint statement read.
Emphasizing the importance of a robust democratic government for Pakistan’s stability, the committee members concurred on the necessity of reaching a consensus.
Two other PPP-P leaders who are part of the coordination committee formed to work out power sharing modalities revealed the PML-N has made no mention of its concerns, if any, against formation of a coalition government.
The PML-N, whose senior leaders’ recent statements suggest that the party was having second thoughts about forming a coalition government, was still working out modalities with the PPP-P on how to smoothly run the assembly business, and on how to reconcile differences over handling government affairs between the two parties, if and when they arise.
This blowing hot and cold by PML-N seems to be an attempt by its leadership to keep the option open to withdraw from this arrangement in a dignified manner if needed. However, thus far it seems that Shehbaz led PML-N is in no mood to give up on its aspirations of forming a federal government.
According to a statement issued by the party, the committee has agreed that a strong democratic government guarantees a stable Pakistan. It said that both sides to give matters a final shape have sought more suggestions that will be deliberated upon on Monday.
Some PML-N leaders said the party is not ready to get blackmailed on agreeing to any unconstitutional demand, which is why it is not interested in forming a government.
A day back all media houses had reported that the party leaders in a meeting presided over by Nawaz Sharif loudly advocated against forming a coalition government in the center and laid emphasis on focusing solely on Punjab.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Sardar Bahadur Khan, who is part of the PPP-P’s talks committee, said his party has in principle agreed to support the PML-N, and the PML-N is very much interested in forming its government.  Nothing has been said to indicate otherwise, he added.
He denied the impression that the PPP wants any ministries in Punjab. He said the PPP indeed wants its political interests in the province to be guarded but is not asking for any ministries.
Regarding senate seats, he said given that they would expect the PML-N to support them to get some Senate seats, that as per numbers they are entitled to.
When asked what positions the PPP-P was asking for, he said that the party wanted constitutional portfolios—the positions of the president, the Senate chairman, the National Assembly speaker. Governorship would be decided with mutual consent, he added.
He said there was no disagreement between the two sides. “The PPP-P will support the PML-N on all important matters including budget, as has already been said by Chairman Bilawal.”
Qamar Zaman Kaira, another member of the PPP delegation, said the media was being a bit over anxious regarding formation of a government, which, he said, will be formed on its own time.
Regarding the PML-N having given any indication to suggest they were not interested in taking the government, he also said that PML-N has given no such hint.
He said the PML-N has the PPP-P’s unconditional support so these meetings are not being held to determine any power sharing formula. “The PPP has already stated that it will not be part of the federal government. The PPP’s support for PMLN is to ensure democratic process in Pakistan does not derail.”
A PPP leader said if the PML-N was not interested in forming a government, as some of its leaders have suggested then it should request the PPP-P to take the lead. He said the PPP-P has the potential and the capability to steer the country out of all the crises.
He said if it gets the chance, the PPP-P will seize this opportunity as it knows that it can reach out to independent candidates for smooth function of assembly business.
“The PML-N only have us to bank on, whereas the PPP would have not only the PML-N but also the PTI backed candidates to reach out to. So we would be in a much more comfortable position. If this happens, the PPP will offer the presidency to the PML-N.”
PML-N’s Ahsan Iqbal and Ayaz Sadiq were approached for the comments but were not available.

2,HBL PSL 9 begins with glitzy opening ceremony,"Ali Zafar and Aima Baig, the voices behind the official anthem of HBL PSL 9, captivated the audience","The opening ceremony of the ninth season of the HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) kicked off on Saturday in a blaze of lights and music, showcasing the country’s rich cultural heritage, at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, marking the beginning of an exciting cricket season.
The festivities commenced with Natasha Baig's rendition of the national anthem, setting a patriotic tone for the evening. Arif Lohar and Noori, accompanied by their respective musical groups, infused the stage with pulsating energy and enchanting melodies.
Adding to the spectacle, Ali Zafar and Aima Baig, the voices behind the official anthem of HBL PSL 9, captivated the audience with their musical prowess and electrifying performance.
Zafar mesmerised the crowd with a dazzling medley featuring his past PSL anthems, adding an extra layer of excitement to the show.
The celebration also featured a captivating laser show, enriching the overall entertainment experience for the audience.
PSL is a T20 league contested by six city-based franchise teams. It was founded by the Pakistan Cricket Board in 2015.
This year, the event is being held in four cities – Karachi, Lahore, Multan and Rawalpindi, with the final scheduled to be played at National Bank Stadium, Karachi on March 18.
Meanwhile, Islamabad United won the opening game of the Pakistan Super League against defending champions the Lahore Qalandars by eight wickets on Saturday.
Promoting himself to No.3, captain Shadab Khan led the way by blistering an unbeaten 74 runs off 41 balls after taking 1-24 with the ball. Two-time champion Islamabad cruised to 200-2 in 18.2 overs after Lahore made 195-5.
Rassie van der Dussen led Lahore with an unbeaten 71 off 41 balls and Sahibzada Farhan added a rapid 57 up front.
Farhan dominated the power play against fast bowler Naseem Shah, who returned after five months out due to a shoulder injury. Naseem claimed the wicket of David Weise in the penultimate over. Naseem's younger brother, Ubaid, had a forgetful league debut, being smashed for 15 in his only over.
Van der Dussen crashed four boundaries and three sixes in the death overs. Shadab and Salman Ali Agha plundered 138 off 67 balls in a third-wicket stand. Agha made 64 off 31.
Lahore badly missed leg-spinner Rashid Khan of Afghanistan, who was ruled out of the tournament because of back injury.
Also, Haris Rauf, whose Pakistan contract was terminated this week after he refused to play tests in Australia last year, conceded 38 in his three overs. Shaheen Shah Afridi, who dropped Shadab early on, ended up with 0-31.

3,Rawalpindi RPO goes on leave amid rigging claims,Spokesperson refutes rumours that senior cop left abroad over Pindi commissioner’s allegations,"A day after Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chatha alleged that rigging occurred during the recent general elections under his watch, the city's regional police officer, Syed Khurram Ali, departed for a trip to the UK with his family on Sunday, intending to return on March 2. This move sparked rumors on social media speculating that he had fled following the ""disclosures.""
On Saturday, the Punjab Information Department invited both the Rawalpindi commissioner and RPO for a news conference related to the Pakistan Super League (PSL) cricket tournament.
However, the RPO's office clarified that the senior official had applied for leave before the elections, which was not approved at that time but was later granted after the polls. The RPO was present at his office on Friday before traveling to Lahore in the evening.
The additional responsibilities have been entrusted to Rawalpindi CPO Khalid Hamdani in the RPO's absence. Authorities stated that it was unclear whether Ali had indeed left for the UK or remained in Lahore. They confirmed that he had taken a 14-day leave and was expected to resume duty on March 2.
The Express Tribune attempted to contact the Rawalpindi RPO but there was no answer.
A handout issued by the Punjab police spokesperson read that the Rawalpindi RPO had applied for a 14-day leave for his trip abroad on January 17 this year before the elections.
It added that a formal summary in this connection was sent to the Punjab CM’s Office on January 30.
The handout continued that the interim Punjab government had approved the 14-day leave of the Rawalpindi RPO based on the recommendations of the summary.

It issued a notification that allowed him to leave the country from February 18 to March 2.
The Rawalpindi RPO’s spokesperson said the official was on a pre-approved leave for a trip abroad from February 18 to March 2.
The spokesperson added that the RPO had applied for a leave to go abroad to the UK a month before and it was approved two weeks ago.

He refuted the “baseless” speculations on social media that the RPO’s leave was linked to the allegations made by the Rawalpindi commissioner.
Taking on social media platform X, interim Punjab CM Mohsin Naqvi also confirmed that the Rawalpindi RPO leave was approved on January 30 this year and notified on January 31.
“Let's foster positivity and refrain from unnecessary controversies. [The] RPO Rawalpindi is a dedicated career officer deserving our respect,” he wrote.
A day earlier, Rawalpindi Commissioner Chatha dropped a bombshell, confessing to his role in “rigging” the recent elections, a week after polls marred by allegations of manipulation returned no clear winner.
Taking responsibility for what he termed a ""heinous crime,"" Chatha implicated not only himself but also pointed fingers at the head of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the country’s top judge -- thrusting them into the spotlight.
The ‘confessions’ came as the ECP has already been in the crosshairs of several rigging allegations in the aftermath of a tumultuous week and thick clouds of manipulation continue to linger over results, throwing further questions over the legitimacy of the ballots.
Chatha, in a stunning admission, announced his intention to surrender to the authorities, acknowledging his role in “tampering” with the electoral outcome by turning the tables and “flipping losers into winners”.

4,"PPP wants democracy, not positions: Bilawal",Claims he declined PML-N’s offer to lead coalition govt as prime minister for two years,"PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has revealed that he was offered to lead the next possible coalition government as the prime minister for two years. However, he declined the offer as his party only wants to ensure democracy and the survival of the federation.
""If I have to become the prime minister, I will want the people of Pakistan to elect me to that position,” Bilawal said on Sunday while addressing a public meeting in Thatta district of Sindh organized to celebrate the PPP’s landslide election victory in the province.
After the Feb 8 general elections, the PML-N and the PPP respectively emerged as the largest and the second-largest party in the National Assembly.
The parties, together with the MQM, the IPP, the PML-Q, and BAP, later agreed to form a coalition government with the two leading parties holding talks to decide a power-sharing formula.
Talking with reference to these negotiations, Bilawal said the PPP does not want federal ministries in return for supporting the PML-N’s candidate for the position of the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif.
""We only want to ensure that democracy and the federation survive. We want to extinguish the fire [of division and hatred] which is spreading in Pakistan. This is why we have decided that [PPP Co-chairman] Asif Ali Zardari will be the party’s candidate for president,"" he added.
He expressed hope that his father, after assuming the presidency, will not only be able to douse the raging flames of political differences but also save the federation. ""Once again, we have to raise the slogan of Pakistan Khappay [we want Pakistan].""
After the assassination of Bilawal’s mother—PPP former chairperson Benazir Bhutto—in December 2007 in a bomb attack in Rawalpindi, Zardari had famously raised the Pakistan Khappay slogan to douse the flames of communal hatred in Sindh, to which Benazir belonged.
Referring to the protests against rigging initiated by various parties in Sindh, Bilawal likened the post-Feb 8 elections situation with the events of 1977 when his grandfather and former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's victory was denied, and the circumstances paved the way for martial law.

""Bhutto had won the elections but when the Nine Stars alliance [Pakistan National Alliance, which comprised nine political parties] started a campaign, the democratic process was rolled back, and the country had to bear with the dictatorship of Ziaul Haq for over 10 years.""
Bilawal contended that the politicians who look towards dictatorship to get power still exist.
""When they talk about rigging today, they are actually demanding that a dictatorship-like system should be established in the country.""
He appealed to all political parties to try to find solutions to their issues in the democratic dispensation.
In the same breath, he warned the people that if the tendency for seeking undemocratic solutions continued, some elements would keep dividing them in the names of religion, sect, and ethnicity.
He later sought a promise from the Jiyalas—PPP’s loyalists—that they will take to the streets on his call if democracy faces some serious threat.
The PPP's chairman said they tried a lot to help PTI founder Imran Khan understand the need to strengthen democracy and parliament, but to no avail.
He claimed that even till today Imran’s party appeared non-serious as its leaders claim that they have won the elections and can singularly form the central government and that too without the PPP's votes.
""We have decided to support those who have come to us and asked for our votes. But we will take no ministries and will pursue no personal interests except the public interests and the basic issues.""

Politics in Sindh
Taking reference to Sindh, where the PPP swept the polls, he said he did not know about Pakistan, but the Sindh government was going to be formed on the basis of Form 45, tacitly conveying his distrust of election results in Punjab while simultaneously asserting the authenticity of the election results in Sindh.
Commenting on the ongoing protests staged by the GDA, the JUI-F, and the JI against alleged rigging in Sindh, Bilawal asked leaders of these parties to substantiate their allegations with evidence. He expressed his readiness to go for by-polls at such constituencies.
In a rejoinder to the allegations of GDA's leader Pir Pagara Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi against the PPP’s alleged role in rigging, Bilawal said Pagara and even his deceased father faced electoral defeats at the hands of his mother--Benazir Bhutto—and grandfather Zulfiqar Bhutto.
He recalled the results of the 2002, 2008, 2013, and 2018 general elections and said despite rigging by the GDA and the PML-Functional, which is now a part of the GDA, they lost all those elections to the PPP.
""Mullah (JUI-F's Rashid Mehmood Soomro) was demanding one seat in each division [of the province], and Pir Sahab was demanding 10 seats,"" he claimed, referring to some back channel communications among these parties.
The PPP's chairman also revealed an episode of an interaction with Pir Pagara's brother Sadaruddin Shah Rashdi some years ago and quoted him as saying that ""at present we are against you but in the end we will be with you"".
Bilawal argued that both the JUI-F and the GDA are mistaken about their electoral support in the province because they only keep in sight their public meetings which are attended by the students enrolled in the seminaries and the spiritual followers of Pir Pagara.
According to him, neither such students have the right to vote for the JUI-F nor the spiritual followers can be assumed with certainty to become voters.
https://t.co/uUP3320DFz
He also responded to the JUI-F's claim that Bilawal was even defeated in his family's constituency in Larkana by Soomro. ""What type of joke is it? On the one hand you call yourself a maulana and on the other hand you tell a lie so firmly.""
He pointed out that he has won NA-194 Larkana with a lead of around 100,000 votes against Soomro.
He invited both the GDA and the JUI-F for a contest in the by-elections on one of the two NA seats which he will vacate either from Larkana or from Qambar-Shahdadkot NA-196 where he defeated Rashid Mahmood Soomro's brother.
Bilawal said his party is being accused of perpetrating violence during the polling but these claims run contrary to fact. He said his workers Shiraz Awan, Abdul Malik Mari, Raza Khoso, and Bilawal Zardari were killed in Karachi, Khairpur, Sanghar, Mirpurkhas, and Naushehro Feroze districts.
A bomb was exploded in Mastung while his candidates and workers came under grenade attacks in Turbat, Bolan, Quetta, and Khuzdar in Balochistan.
