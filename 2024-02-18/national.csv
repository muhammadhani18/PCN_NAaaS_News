0,Gas price surge expected to propel inflation to 25%,"Recent gas and oil price hikes set to fuel inflation, impacting consumers and industries alike","The latest hike in gas and petroleum oil prices for households and industrial consumers in February is estimated to increase the inflation rate by almost half a percentage point to around 25% in the current fiscal year 2023-24, reducing the likelihood of a token cut in the benchmark interest rate in mid-March 2024.

The projection for the inflation rate does not account for the potential impact of political upheaval following the election upset. Prolonged political crisis over the establishment of a new government at the centre, and its ripple effects, particularly any delays in securing a new International Monetary Fund loan programme post-April, could further raise inflation.

The surge in gas prices is expected to curb the smuggling of fertiliser to neighbouring countries at the expense of farmers and consumers, increasing the supply of urea and DAP in the country and reducing the need for their import.

In a commentary on the impact of the gas price hike on inflation and commodity prices, Arif Habib Limited (AHL) stated that the increase in gas prices could lead to a 43 basis point rise in the inflation rate. “With the current inflation rate standing at 28.3% as of January 2024, we anticipate that, taking this effect into account, the CPI (consumer price index) for FY24 will likely reach 24.91% year-on-year.”

While speaking to The Express Tribune, AHL’s Head of Research, Tahir Abbas, said that the inflation rate estimate for FY24 before the recent gas price hike was around 24.50%.

The latest inflation rate projection of 24.91% does not include the likely impact of the upward revision in petroleum oil product prices for the second half of February 2024, he added.

Optimus Capital Management (OCM) foresees the impact of the new gas pricing on inflation to be relatively low at 35 basis points, increasing the full-year inflation rate for FY24 to 24%.

To recall, the federal cabinet approved the weighted average gas price increase by 12.3% to Rs1,533/mmbtu (million British thermal units) from the last price of Rs1,365/mmbtu in November 2023.

Among notable increases, the gas tariff for fertiliser manufacturers witnessed a significant jump of almost 700%, an increase of 67% for residential consumers, and a surge of 25% for captive power plants operating mostly in export industries.

“We estimate a minimal 10% increase in gas prices across all income quintiles (other than the protected class),” AHL said.
This is the second gas price hike in three months made to fulfil IMF conditions ahead of the second and last review of the domestic economy by the global lender under its current programme of $3 billion, ending in April 2024.

The government also revised up diesel prices by Rs8.27/litre, increasing to Rs287.33/litre for the period from February 16 to 29. It raised petrol prices by Rs2.73/litre to Rs275.62/litre.

Days before the latest hikes in oil and gas prices, OMC, Research Analyst, Maaz Azam, had projected February’s inflation rate to sharply reduce to 24-24.5% compared to 28.3% in January. Further declines to 20-21% are expected for March 2024.

Read Govt set to raise gas prices up to 41%

In its late January 2024 monetary policy statement, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) revised up its projection for the FY24 average inflation rate to 23-25% compared to July 2023’s estimate at 20-22%.

SBP Governor, Jameel Ahmad, linked the upward revision in the inflation rate to the hike in November 2023’s gas prices by the government, stating that the impact of the price hike was significantly higher than the bank’s projections.
Sectoral Impact:

AHL stated that the urea price is estimated to climb up by Rs1,120/50kg bag after the feedstock gas prices are massively hiked up to Rs1,597/mmbtu from Rs580/mmbtu in November 2023 (up by 2.8 times). Whereas, the fuel stock price for fertiliser manufacturers has increased to Rs1,597/mmbtu (previously: Rs1,580), up by 1.1%.

To recall, the fertiliser manufacturers were provided subsidised gas to make urea available at Rs2,500/bag to farmers. However, the low pricing encouraged smuggling of the fertiliser to comparatively expensive markets, resulting in the price of the chemical to around Rs5,000/bag in local markets.

The research house further said that keeping in view the partial gas dependency of Engro Fertiliser on the Petroleum Policy 2012 policy, the impact on it will be lower compared to other urea manufacturers; albeit the company would need to augment prices by Rs846/bag to completely pass on the impact.

Meanwhile, Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited (FFBL) will have to revise urea and DAP prices by Rs1,367/bag and Rs530/bag, respectively, to pass on the impact completely.

It is pertinent to note that OGRA has not yet notified a revision in feed and fuel prices of consumers under the MARI network. However, once notified (assuming the same as SNGP and SSGC) for MARI network plants, the Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC) will have to raise urea prices by Rs1,120/bag to pass on the impact fully.

AHL also estimated, assuming an average Rs1,000/bag increase in urea prices by the industry (including FFC) and for every one-month lag in MARI gas notification, FFC would have a monthly positive after-tax earnings impact of Rs1.88/share.
Gas tariff for cement players using captive power plants has increased to 2,750/mmbtu, up 10%. “Our workings suggest that Lucky Cement will have to raise prices by nearly Rs10/bag to completely pass on the impact of higher gas prices.”
Usage of gas by long steel players (manufacturers of rebars: ASTL and MUGHAL) during the reheating process is very low. The steel manufacturers are mostly relying on furnace oil for power generation, therefore, the impact would be muted.

EPCL has to raise PVC prices by $15/tonne to fully offset the impact. Lotte Chemical will need to raise PTA prices by $13/tonne to fully pass on the impact.

Besides, the gas price hike would make available the required financing to oil and gas exploration and oil marketing companies and help control circular debt. The beneficiaries may include OGDC, PPL, PSO, SNGPL, and SSGC.

1,‘Govt must reconsider gas tariff hike’,KCCI President expresses concerns over rising production costs,"Trader bodies on Saturday urged the federal government to reconsider its decision to hike the gas tariff to address concerns of the business community.
Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) President Ahsan Zafar Bakhtawari and President of Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh, made the demand during a meeting held here, according to a news release. They expressed concerns over the federal cabinet’s approval of a 67% increase in gas tariffs as it would increase production costs, reduce industrial activities, and badly hurt exports.
During a meeting, they urged the government to take solid measures and ensure competitive energy tariffs for the industry to boost industrialisation and exports.
President ICCI highlighted that Pakistan’s economy is in deep trouble, citing the manufacturing sector still struggling to recover, textile sector exports declining by around 3% during July-January 2023-24, and foreign exchange reserves of $8 billion, which are insufficient to cover only 6 weeks of imports.
He said Pakistan needs $22 billion in external financing during 2024-25 to meet its financing needs.
To cope with these challenges, Pakistan urgently needs to boost industrialisation and exports. However, the repeated hikes in electricity and gas tariffs have made the cost of doing business very high which is hurting production activities and making exports uncompetitive in the international market.

President KCCI emphasised that Karachi’s industries were demanding a reduction in gas tariffs to improve industrial activities. He expressed concern that increased gas tariffs would create more problems for the industry that would slow down the economic growth of the country.
He urged that the new government in consultation with the private sector should fix the utility tariffs for the next 10 years to enable better growth of business activities and revive the economy.
Bakhtawari, former President ICCI and Secretary General UBG, stressed that the government should privatise all loss-making utility companies to reduce their burden on the national exchequer and improve their performance.
Both chambers called for political stability in the country, which is the key requirement to achieve economic stability. They urged that the new government should give top priority to promoting ease of doing business to make Pakistan a hub of business and investment activities and enable it to emerge as a strong economy.
Both chambers agreed to work in close cooperation to address the key issues of the business community and create a conducive business environment.

2,Post-election turmoil takes toll on PSX,"KSE-100 index losses 3,071 points, or -4.9% WoW, to close at 59,872.96","At the beginning of the week, political uncertainty deepened with no clear majority for any political party in general elections, leading investors to resort to panic selling to avoid hefty losses, plunging the bourse.
The next day, stocks showed signs of recovery as Morgan Stanley Capital International announced the addition of 19 companies to its MSCI frontier small-cap index in the Quarterly Index Review. On Wednesday, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its winning streak in a spectacular rally, with the index climbing impressively over 900 points as investors were optimistic about the prospect of setting up a coalition government.
The following day, however, the changing political scenario dragged down the index nearly 2% to around 61,000 points as the race among different political parties for forming a new government discouraged investors. On Friday, the PSX plummeted nearly 2% to above 59,000 points amid intense political turmoil following the emergence of a new version of the story about former Premier Imran Khan’s ouster by a no-confidence motion in April 2022. Besides, mainstream political players’ failure to reach a coalition arrangement necessary to form a new government dented investor sentiment.
Overall, the market collapsed by 3,071 points, or -4.9% WoW, to close at 59,872.96 points. JS Global analyst Shagufta Irshad, in her review, observed that the KSE-100 remained volatile throughout the week, closing with a 5% week-on-week (WoW) decline. Average traded volumes increased 14% WoW to 350 million shares/day, with a 4% decline in terms of US dollar value at the PSX. So far, KSE-100 has lost 4,271 points, or ~7%, since the general elections held on 8th February due to a lack of clarity over the upcoming setup of the new government.
“Dialogues among leaders of pivotal political parties centred on the establishment of a new government and putting forth candidates for crucial positions, was the talk of the town during the week,” she said. Political news flow overshadowed the strong corporate earnings and dividend announcements that came during the week.
Among the key news were OGRA formally notifying the first semi-annual gas price hike with a major increase witnessed in protected residential consumers (40-60% hike across various slabs) and the fertiliser sector (175% rise in feedstock gas prices). The government also notified a Rs2.7/8.4 per litre increase in petrol and diesel prices. Moreover, PBS reported 3.4% YoY growth in LSM figures for the month of Dec-23. On the macro front, the SBP reported a 0.3% WoW increase in FX reserves maintaining at $8 billion level for the past 3 months.

The SBP also conducted PIB auction during the week, where cut-off yields remained stable at 16.8%, 15.5%, 14.5%, for three, five, and 10-year papers, the JS analyst added. 
“Furthermore, the caretaker federal cabinet approved a 12.3% weighted average hike in gas prices. In December 2023, Large Scale Manufacturing Industries (LSMI) output rose by 3.4% YoY. Also, there was a rise in the prices of petroleum products by PKR 2.73 of motor spirit (MS) and PKR 8.37 of High-Speed Diesel (HSD),” Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported.
Along with this, remittances surged by 26% YoY to $2.4 billion during January 2024. The SBP’s reserves inched up by $12 million to $8.1 billion. The rupee closed at 279.36 against the US dollar, weakening by Rs0.08, or 0.03% WoW. Overall, the market closed at 59,872.96 points, declining by 3,071 points, or -4.9% WoW.
Sector-wise negative contributors were Oil and Gas Exploration Companies (1,176 points), Cement (288 points), Power Generation and Distribution (287 points), Oil and Gas Marketing Companies (216 points), and Commercial Banks (206 points). A remarkable healthy contributor was Textile Spinning (3 points).
During the week, foreign buying clocked in at $5.2 million compared to net buying of $5.7 million last week. Major buying was witnessed in exploration and production firms ($2.2 million) and all other sectors ($1.2 million).

3,HCCI president urges energy policy overhaul,"Advocates for sustainable solutions amidst rising tariffs, economic challenges","Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) President Adeel Siddiqui urged the government to focus on solar and wind energy with a consistent and sustainable policy, while also advocating for research on artificial gas through the Thar coal project.
He stressed the need to arrange gas through both conventional and unconventional methods to achieve self-sufficiency in the country’s energy sector. Siddiqui suggested that instead of relying on expensive Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) imports, research on artificial gas through the Thar coal project should be prioritised.
In a statement on Saturday, Siddiqui highlighted how economic degradation and unemployment were leading to poverty and a subsequent increase in crime rates. He insisted that energy tariffs could be controlled by eliminating line losses through comprehensive policy measures. He urged the government to prioritise solar and wind energy investments over importing LNG, which annually burdens the national economy with $1.25 billion in additional costs.

Siddiqui cautioned that the industrial sector would not grow without consistent economic policies, regardless of changes in government. He pointed out that the recent 250% increase in energy costs, including a Rs4.26 rise per unit of electricity under fuel adjustment, would adversely affect small traders and the cost of doing business, making lives miserable for many.
“We are paying 16 cents per kWh, while neighbouring and regional countries, as well as the rest of the world, charge only 6 cents per kWh,” he remarked. Siddiqui argued that exports could not increase with such a steep rise in energy costs, reiterating that the manifold increase in gas tariffs would escalate production costs and hinder export competitiveness, preventing Pakistan from competing effectively in the international market.

4,"‘China is becoming tech, pharma powerhouse’",The IMD launched its inaugural China Company Transformation Indicator (CCTI) earlier this month,"China is becoming a global powerhouse in tech and pharmaceuticals, according to a new indicator released by the Switzerland-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD).
The IMD launched its inaugural China Company Transformation Indicator (CCTI) earlier this month, focusing on technology, pharmaceuticals and apparel. The report revealed that internet technology firms still dominate China’s technological sector, with Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent among the top five, alongside JD.com and NetEase.

IMD China’s CEO Mark Greeven said in a video interview with Xinhua that three hard tech companies have also secured their place among the top 10, including semiconductor giant SMIC, computer maker Lenovo and global security technology leader Hikvision.
The IMD indicator also highlighted a dynamic interplay between foreign multinational corporations and innovative national companies in the pharmaceutical sector. Greeven said the Year of the Dragon will be a “roaring year” for the Chinese economy, given the growth of 4 or 5% in real estate and exports, which are traditional drivers of China’s economic growth.

5,Businessmen urge opening of more Pak-Afghan borders,"Border closure, limits operation at Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi border posts have shifted trade workload to Torkham border","Businessmen dealing in Pak-Afghan trade have demanded FBR and Ministry of Commerce to open Ghulam Khan and Kharlachi borders with Afghanistan for full-fledged commercial activities in the wake of the excessive transportation burden on the Torkhem border post.
In a joint press statement issued on Saturday, Coordinator Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Ziaul Haq Sarhadi and former senior vice president Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Manzoor Elahi said Chaman border closure and limited operation at Ghulam Khan and Kharlachi border posts have shifted all trade workload to the Torkham border.

“Excessive transportation of goods from Torkham to Afghanistan and Central Asian Countries, ensued in prolonging travel duration of goods laden trucks from ten days to around one and a half month and excessive increase in charges,” they explained. Transportation charges for trucks have been hiked to an exorbitant level of Rs1.1 million because of prolonged travel duration which makes it almost impossible for businessmen to bear the expense, they said.
Sarhadi highlighted that a truck carrying goods to Afghanistan returns to Pakistan after around 45 days and the owners now prefer local transportation within the country, instead of sending their vehicles to Afghanistan, creating an acute shortage of vehicles.

6,Gas price hike for fertiliser plants sought,Issue of raising gas prices by 175% may go to ECC next week,"The government has initiated discussions to increase gas prices for the remaining six fertiliser plants aimed at preventing the possibility of windfall profits of around Rs100 billion due to its earlier decision to raise prices for only four plants.
The issue of gas prices in the range of 175%, or Rs1,017 per mmbtu, may go to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet next week, along with another proposal to prioritise gas allocation to the industrial sector, according to government sources.
Earlier this month, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) approved giving priority gas supply to the industrial sector, alongside residential and commercial users. The SIFC has approved the new gas supply merit order, with the ECC’s approval pending to finalise it. Under the revised order, fertiliser and power plants would receive second priority.
Sources said the deliberations about gas price increases are taking place separately in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Energy after the fresh revision in gas prices for four fertiliser plants created a lacuna. Authorities have concerns that these six plants might exploit the gap to raise urea prices despite no increase in their input costs.
The federal cabinet increased gas prices on Wednesday in the range of 29% to 700% for four fertiliser plants receiving gas through the networks of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL). It did not adjust prices for six other plants receiving gas from the Mari gas network.
Gas prices for Fatima Fertiliser and Agritech increased by 29%, for the new Engro Fertiliser plant by 700%, and for Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited plant by 175%. After the increase, gas prices for these plants are now equal to the prescribed price of Rs1597 per mmbtu. However, this move discriminates against these plants compared to six others getting gas from the Mari Petroleum Company Limited network.
Read: SITE association president condemns gas tariff hike
Mari Petroleum Company Limited (MPCL) is entitled to receive wellhead gas prices in accordance with relevant agreements with the government for gas produced from its various natural gas reservoirs. Mari Field wellhead gas prices are determined and notified by OGRA bi-annually under the Oil and Gas Regulatory Ordinance.
The six plants receive gas at the rate of Rs580 per mmbtu for feedstock, which is Rs1017 or 64% less than the prices for the other six plants. Three out of the six plants belong to Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC), one old Engro fertiliser plant, one plant of Fatima Fertiliser, and the Pak-Arab Fertiliser Limited plant.
According to some estimates, the increase in input costs for the four plants, which produce less than 40% of the total urea, may result in about a Rs750 per urea bag increase. The six plants produce about 63% of the total fertiliser and can get away with Rs100 billion in windfall profits even by keeping prices slightly lower than other manufacturers.
However, if the government increases gas prices, these six plants may have to cover the difference above Rs580 per mmbtu and the new rate in the form of the Gas Development Surcharge (GDS). Additional GDS revenue would go to the provinces. Gas Supply Agreements for six Mari-based plants are valid until June 2024.
Despite receiving billions of rupees in subsidies in the past, the four plants did not significantly benefit farmers.
Sources said that there is a possibility that a summary might be taken to the ECC next week to end the disparity in rates among all ten fertiliser plants. But along with the decision on gas prices, there must be a solution to use the GDS, as the additional funds given to the provinces can be used for other farming-related purposes, they added.
Urea is available in the market in the range of Rs5,000 to Rs5,500 compared to notified prices of around Rs3,600 per bag.
The issue of urea price increases due to an increase in gas prices was discussed at the last ECC meeting.
Industry Minister Gohar Ejaz was of the view that manufacturers would not increase prices because they were already selling the product at higher rates in the black market. However, the energy minister believed that fertiliser companies would increase prices, and there was no effective mechanism to stop them. Some ECC members believed that fertiliser plants should not be charged uniform rates, which was not accepted.

7,APTMA urges govt to rethink energy pricing,"Voices concern over rising energy costs, calls for competitive rates to sustain global competitiveness.","The All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) has expressed deep concern over the government’s decision to increase energy prices and urges the government to reconsider its stance on energy pricing for industrial consumers.
It has raised concerns over the increase in captive gas price to Rs2,750/MMBtu and the plan to supply industry with a 35:65 domestic gas/RLNG blend, pushing the price of captive power generation well above regionally competitive levels.
The international competitiveness of Pakistan’s textiles and apparel exports is continuously eroded by ever-increasing energy prices, which are over twice those in competing regional economies. Production at these rates is not financially feasible, and we are rapidly losing market share to countries like Bangladesh, India, and Vietnam that have significantly lower energy tariffs.
“The government wants to shut down captive generation by making it unaffordable. With grid electricity price at over 16.7 cents/kWh, there is no financially viable source of energy for the industry to continue manufacturing with,” APTMA said in a statement.
While the intent to streamline gas consumption is understandable, the transition must not jeopardise the textile and apparel industry’s viability.
For the industry to remain competitive, provide employment, and earn foreign exchange, energy prices must align with regional benchmarks, said the statement. The current scenario, where the industry is made to cross-subsidise other power consumers, is untenable and counterproductive to our shared goals of economic stability and growth, it read.
APTMA urged the government to reconsider its stance on energy pricing for industrial consumers. A shift away from captive generation should be incentivised by removing cross-subsidies from power tariffs for industrial consumers and bringing them down to a regionally competitive level of 9 cents/kWh, said the association. Moreover, B2B power contracts must be allowed with a use of system/wheeling charge of 1-1.5 cents/kWh for procurement of green energy at competitive endues prices that are necessary to maintain export competitiveness following the advent of the EU C-BAM and other green regulations.
“We stand ready to work closely with the government to ensure that Pakistan’s textile and apparel industry remains a global competitor, providing jobs to millions and contributing to the country’s export and economic growth,” said the statement.

8,PSX plans Sukuk auction for lower financing costs,Govt hopes to raise Rs150 billion at low rate of return at auction on Feb 20,"The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) is scheduled to hold its next auction to sell one to five-year Sukuks on Tuesday (February 20), helping the cash-strapped government raise a targeted Rs150 billion at apparently comparatively lower rates of return.
This would be the third auction in a row since December 2023. The key element to be observed by financial experts would be to see the cost of financing, which remains the single most important element of shifting such auctions to the national bourse from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
The availability of ample liquidity with investors – from various financial institutions – at the stock market has helped in borrowing the required financing at relatively lower rates in the previous auctions held in December 2023 and January 2024 at PSX compared to conventional one-year T-bills and three to five-year Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB).
The auctions arranged by the central bank to sell T-bills and PIBs did not mostly receive bids from investors like asset management companies, mutual funds, pension funds, high net worth individuals, and retail investors, and the participants in the auction mostly remained commercial banks.
In a comment, a joint issuer of the Sukuk, Meezan Bank official Ahmed Ali Siddiqui said, “With the successful issuance of Sukuk, the government is not only saving significant costs as compared to interest-based T-bills and PIBs but also shifting towards Shariah-compliant financing in line with the Federal Shariat Court decision to eliminate riba/interest from the financial system by December 2027.”

Read Govt raises Rs86b in Sukuk auction at PSX
In the previous two auctions at PSX, the Ministry of Finance has successfully raised approximately Rs30 billion and Rs80 billion in December 2023 and January 2024, respectively.
The auction scheduled for Tuesday will sell five Sukuks, namely one-year discounted Ijarah Sukuk, three-year variable rate Ijarah Sukuk, three-year fixed-rate Ijarah Sukuk, five-year variable rate Ijarah Sukuk, and five-year fixed-rate Ijarah Sukuk.
The one-year discounted Ijarah Sukuk will be under fresh issuance, while the issuance of three and five-year variable and fixed-rate Sukuks will be against the reopening of Sukuk issued in the January 2024 auction. This will be the first time a Sukuk will be reopened through auction at PSX.
The reopening of Sukuk is similar to that of the issuance of a completely new Sukuk where the transaction is concluded by purchasing an additional share in the identified asset, which is then leased out via a separate Ijarah agreement executed with the government of Pakistan.
