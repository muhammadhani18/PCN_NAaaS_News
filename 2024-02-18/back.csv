7,Vawda puts Maulana and commissioner on the back foot,"Says poll results did not match Fazl’s ‘wish list’, terms Rwp commissioner’s remarks ‘drama’","Former federal minister Faisal Vawda on Saturday took a dig at JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, saying the general elections results did not match the latter’s “wish list”, and that his “file” had become quite heavy and had gone as far as “Turkiye”.

Talking to a private TV channel, the former federal minister said everyone saw Maulana’s “game”.

“He (Fazl) did not get [poll] results according to his wish list. He will agree soon. His file has become quite heavy and has gone as far as Turkiye.”

Vawda said it was to be seen whether all the “expired leaders” are on “one container or locked inside it”.

Commenting on Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha over his “confession” to being involved in “polls rigging”, the former federal minister said the latter’s revelation was only a “drama”.

The former minister opined there was a possibility that the PML-N had “launched” and “given money” to the Rawalpindi commissioner. “Here, the entire game is of money. Everyone has self-interest here.”

Vawda said the commissioner was about to retire in 10-12 days, questioning how could a “normal person” admit after ten days of elections that the ballot was rigged.

“If it (confession) was after ten minutes, or even after ten hours, one could have admitted it. After ten days you are saying your conscience has awakened.”

On Chattha’s remarks that he was willing to commit suicide over “his involvement in polls rigging”, Vawda said people in the country were willing to take their lives but no one “actually commits it”.

He said a person who was retiring after ten days was himself questionable. “From where did he (Rawalpindi commissioner) get so much property? Where did his property files come from? Who is he friends with?”

He termed Chattha’s remarks of conscience “non-sense”.

8,Shehbaz decries forces of anarchy,Claims that PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif has always worked for peoples’ welfare," 
 PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif has said those who had the agenda to spread anarchy in the country are doing the same right now while PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, on the other hand, thinks only about the welfare of the people.

“Nawaz Sharif doesn't think about his own interests and politics. He always thinks about Pakistan and the people's interests. We are striving to save Pakistan from any new calamity or crisis,” Shehbaz said.

He added that the people who had the agenda to spread anarchy are still trying to create chaos. However, he did not elaborate as to who he was referring to.

The PML-N president, who is likely to lead a ruling coalition—comprising the PML-N, the PPP, the MQM, the IPP and BAP—as the next prime minister, was speaking to various returning candidates who on Saturday announced joining the PML-N.

Rashid Akbar Nawani, who won the election from National Assembly constituency NA-92 Bhakkar, Ahmad Nawaz Nawani who won from PP-90 Bhakkar, and Amir Inayat Shahani who won the election from PP-92 and PP-93 Bhakkar seats, announced their inclusion in the PML-N.

Additionally, Hasham Inamullah Khan from the K-P Assembly constituency PK-106 and Malik Tariq Awan from the K-P Assembly constituency PK-82 also announced joining the party.

These independent candidates expressed confidence in Nawaz Sharif's leadership and hoped that only the PML-N could steer the country out of its issues. Shehbaz Sharif extended them a warm welcome and stated that political instability in the country serves no one's interests.

“The economic challenges demand that everyone works together for Pakistan. We have saved the country from default before, and that remains our priority,” he said, adding that “We want the progress of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This progress is, however, only possible by curbing terrorism.”

Shehbaz served as the prime minister between April 2022 to August 2023 after ouster of the PTI led federal government in the wake of a no trust vote.

In October 2023, Nawaz Sharif returned to Pakistan, ending his four-year-long self-imposed exile. The PML-N supreme leader was also exonerated in the corruption cases that were filed against him in the wake of the Panama Papers leaks.
However, in Feb 8 general elections the PML-N, despite emerging as the largest party in the National Assembly, failed to get enough seats to form a government on its own.

Against this backdrop and amid the controversy surrounding the general elections that many now claim were highly rigged, Nawaz decided not to run for the prime ministerial post this time and nominated Shehbaz, his younger brother, as the PML-N’s candidate for premiership.

9,"PTI, its faction agree to form K-P govt","According to sources, if there are no legal issues, newly elected PTI-backed independent members will join PTI-P","The PTI and its breakaway faction have agreed in principle to unite as one for forming the government in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, it emerged on Saturday.

PTI-Parliamentarians spokesperson Ziaullah Khan Bangash confirmed that the PTI and his party had successfully negotiated on the issue of government formation in K-P.

According to details, the first round of talks between the two parties for acquiring reserved seats and forming the K-P government has been successful, after which all points have been finalised in a joint meeting of both sides.

Bangash said both the parties had agreed in principle to unite as one and also formed a team of lawyers that would review the legal aspects related to the acquisition of the reserved seats.

According to sources, if there are no legal issues or complications, the newly elected PTI-backed independent members will join the PTI-P.

Bangash clarified that PTI-P chief Pervez Khattak quitting from post of the party head as well as its basic membership was not related to the unification of the two parties but because of his ill health.
