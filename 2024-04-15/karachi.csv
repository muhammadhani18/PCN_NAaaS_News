2,"With three-year term nearing end, HBFC chief doesn’t rule out another extension",Says ‘smear campaign’ launched against him after he demanded hard work from employees.,"• Disgruntled employees allege academic qualification required for the post lowered in 2021 to accommodate Imran Ahad
• HBFC chief says ‘smear campaign’ launched against him after he demanded hard work from employees
KARACHI: As the incumbent managing director and chief executive officer of the House Building Finance Company (HBFC) is set to complete his three-year term on April 18, disgruntled employees in the company allege that the CEO is ‘trying’ to secure a three-year extension without prior approval of the federal government, it has emerged.
Sources told Dawn that HBFC chief Imran Ahad was appointed in 2021 during the then government of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf despite the fact that he did not possess a master’s degree required for the position of MD.
They said that in order to appoint Mr Ahad, the main criterion of a master’s degree published in an earlier advertisement was changed to graduation in another advertisement.
The sources said even trainee officer positions at the HBFC require candidates to have a master’s degree.
Mr Ahad’s three-year contract is set to expire on April 18 and he is reportedly trying to secure an extension through the HBFC Board of Directors using the State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) Act as a justification. Mr Ahad did not outrightly denied that he was interested in an extension.
The sources said that it would be a clear violation of the established rules and regulations as, traditionally, appointments of the HBFC MD and their contract extensions require approval from the federal government.
According to rules, the HBFC chief executive “shall be appointed by the Board with the prior approval of the Federal Government. The Chief Executive shall be appointed from amongst persons having knowledge and experience in banking, preferably in the field of finance and economics in accordance with fit and proper criteria as laid down by State Bank of Pakistan from time to time.
“The Chief Executive shall be a whole time officer of the Company and shall be appointed by the Board for a period of three years, extendible for further term by the Board upon the advice of the Federal Government,” it added.
The sources said that salaries of regular HBFC employees had not been increased during his tenure, causing deep resentment among them.
Many disgruntled employees said the appointment of the HBFC chief had become controversial from the beginning and in an audit report it was mentioned that the “audit was of the view that the appointment of incumbent without fulfilment & observance of codal formalities and criteria reflected negligence and favouritism”.
They appealed to the authorities to halt the alleged illegal extension process and appoint a ‘qualified and capable’ individual to lead the HBFC.
HBFC chief denies allegations
When contacted, the HBFC chief denied all the allegations and said that these were part of a ‘smear campaign’ against him.
He said that some people in the company were behind this campaign as he demanded ‘performance’ and ‘hard work’ but such people did not want to come out of their ‘comfort zone’.
About change of educational criterion from a master’s to graduation for the appointment, he said he was not aware of any advertisement that had demanded a master’s from candidates for the post.
He said that only one advertisement was published in which graduation was required as the qualification for the post of the HBFC MD.
Without going into details about the allegation of ‘negligence and favouritism’ as mentioned in the audit report, he said whatever the issue there, the ministry of finance had “dealt with it”, and it had been resolved.
About renewal of his three-year contract, he said he was not trying to get an extension, but “if it is approved, it would be done with the approval of the ministry of finance”.
“According to the SOE Act, the Board is the approving body [for extension] and it is responsible to report to the ministry of finance,” he said.
Mr Ahad said that the HBFC had achieved ‘record financial progress’ during his tenure, which could not be digested by ‘some people’ who were levelling baseless allegations against him.

3,Lone zoo elephant still awaits reunion with sisters in Karachi’s Safari Park,Madhubala lives in solitary confinement in Karachi Zoo following death of longtime companion Noor Jehan in April 2023.,"KARACHI: Elephant Madhubala continues to live in solitary confinement at the Karachi zoo despite several official promises made over the last year for her reunion with her sisters housed at the Safari Park.
Sources said the poor elephant was left alone following the tragic death of her longtime partner, Noor Jehan, in April last year. Since then, they said, plans were announced several times for her relocation but none could be materialised, mainly due to lack of interest on part of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), which is running the facilities for captive animals in the city.
Information gathered from sources indicated that there was no possibility for the pachyderm finding immediate relief from her solitary confinement and getting united with her sisters as construction for expansion and improvement of the elephant area at the Safari Park had not begun yet.
Last year, the 18-year-old African elephant underwent treatment for life-threatening blood parasitic infections that had earlier affected Noor Jehan. Both elephants had undergone surgeries for their damaged and infected tusks in 2022.

Madhubala lives in solitary confinement in Karachi Zoo following death of longtime companion Noor Jehan in April 2023

Replying to concerns about Madhubala’s health, senior zoo official Abida Raees said that she was healthy and fit for relocation and that the zoo administration was in constant contact with experts representing the Four Paws (FP), an international non-profit organisation assisting the local authorities on elephant care for the past several years.
“FP experts completed Madhubala’s crate training in December last year and they would decide the time for her relocation. There is no delay on our part,” Ms Raees said, adding that the zoo staff was following experts’ instructions.
Relocation pending since 2021
It might be recalled that the relocation of a pair of zoo elephants to the Safari Park was first recommended in December 2021 by FP in its report submitted to the Sindh High Court. The court was approached by the Pakistan Animal Welfare Society (Paws) activists concerned over animals’ plight.
The experts made the recommendation on the ground that the Safari Park was closer to the species’ appropriate environment and housed two more elephants of the same family — Sonia and Malika. The four female elephants were captured from the wild in Tanzania and brought to Karachi in 2009. Two of them were housed in the zoo and the other two at the Safari Park.
Their reunion, experts believed, would have a great positive impact on their physical and psychological well-being.
Sources regretted that KMC running the facilities for captive animals in the city didn’t pay heed to the experts’ advice on elephants’ relocation. The suggestion, however, gathered steam last year when Noor Jehan, the other zoo elephant, met a painful death.
The 17-year-old ailing African elephant had initially undergone emergency treatment for health complications but later ‘fell’ in her pond. She passed away on April 22, 2023 leaving her longtime partner Madhubala, alone.
‘Efforts on for relocation’
Asked about the reasons for delay in Madhubala’s relocation to the Safari Park, Katharina Braun representing FP International’s department for public relations explained in an email that the plan was very much a priority of the organisation and its teams were working tirelessly at the moment to make it happen as soon as possible.
“However, many factors contribute to the actual relocation: All agreements and needed papers need to be ready and signed — some of which were only signed recently in 2024. The agreement with KMC was finalised in February 2024,” she stated.
Moreover, she pointed out, all required and recommended improvement of the keeping conditions at the Safari Park must be finished before Madhubala could be relocated.
“The recent elections in Pakistan also had to be considered, as we are always respecting locally relevant events that might impact our schedule and timings,” she said.
About the progress achieved so far, Ms Braun stated that Dr Amir Khalil and his team recently met engineers and architects in Karachi to finalise the design and structural drawings for the improvement of Safari Park.
“The plans include increasing the land for the elephants to 5.2 acres. There will be a bigger pool and mud bath and enrichment for all three elephants. There will also be an elephant-proof fence and safety measures will be taken to make sure both the Mahouts and elephants are protected and their contact will be protected as well,” she added.
Ms Braun hoped that construction on the project would start after Eid.
“The project is definitely not on hold – ever since the agreement with KMC was signed. However, preparations with metal work and other elements of the design for the construction and the actual construction work would take some time. Once construction begins, we estimate that it [the required improvements at the park] will take one to two months to complete.”
It might be mentioned here that FP is solely responsible for infrastructure development/upgradation of the elephant area at the Safari Park under its agreement with the KMC.

4,"This week 50 years ago: Exhibitions, dilapidated buildings and humorous mushaira","THESE days, one seldom gets to see a show where handicrafts made by local artisans are on display. This was not the...","THESE days, one seldom gets to see a show where handicrafts made by local artisans are on display. This was not the case in the past. On April 15, 1974 a news item with reference to an exhibition held as part of the three-day Sindh Literary and Cultural Conference at the Sindh Centre near the YMCA highlighted, among other objects, a ja’i namaz with embroidery on a spotted deer skin as the choicest handicraft on view. The exhibition also had pieces of jewellery, textile and furniture; tiles; works of literature; and official historic documents. Also displayed was the 350-year-old Dalayal-ul-Khairat in Arabic with its Persian translation and a volume on medicine titled Tib-i-Akbar.
Another similar noteworthy programme on April 20 grabbed the media’s attention when an exhibition of personal belongings, letters, books and photographs of Allama Iqbal was inaugurated at the National Museum of Pakistan by the Provincial Education Minister Pyarali Allana to commemorate the 36th death anniversary of the poet. Among the exhibits were: a rare photo taken in Jerusalem where a meeting of the Motamar-i-Alam-i-Islami was held 43 years ago in which the grand mufti of Palestine and Iqbal were shown together; a chair used by the poet, his coats, a stick, an umbrella, pictures taken with the Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah during the Round Table Conference and some paintings.
Certain old pieces of recent history also became the centre of attention that week albeit in a different context. On April 17, it was reported that dozens of buildings were posing a serious threat to the lives of over 20000 residents, mostly in the old city area. From 1969 to 1973, 71 buildings were declared dangerous by the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) but 28 of them could be demolished. Action in respect of the remaining 43 was suspended when owners or occupants moved the court against the KMC and obtained a stay order. According to the corporation, it had been withholding demolition work in many cases for five years due to legal complications. Most of the structures, it suspected, might not survive the forthcoming monsoon season as they were in an extremely poor condition. The residents had been warned by the KMC and advised to take necessary precautions. The oldest pending case was that of a double-storey building in Bombay Bazaar. It was declared dangerous in 1967.
What sometimes, if not always, takes out citizens from ‘dangerous’ spaces is a sense of humour. On April 17, a humorous mushaira titled Shab-i-Qehqaha on the occasion of the 10th death anniversary of poet Zareef Jalalpuri was held at the Karachi Press Club (KPC). Poets who participated in the event included Syed Mohammad Jafri, Dr Inam Ahsan, Mister Dehalvi, Prof Taha Khan, Ustad Bedil, Majeed Majid, Saif Sultanpuri, Amirul Islam Hashmi, Azim Ahmed Abbasi, Fazal Ahmed Siddiqi Bashshash, Ismail Anis, Harfan Lakhnavi, Shahid Alwari and 
Quaid bin Zareef. An audio clip of Zareef Jalalpuri’s poem ‘Teddy Boy’, too, was played at the mushaira which was presided over by Dr Mahmud Husain, Vice-Chancellor of Karachi University.

The demonstration, organised by the Palestine Foundation Pakistan (PLF), also welcomed Iran’s retaliatory strikes on Israel over an attack on its embassy in Damascus. 
The protesters carried portraits of three slain sons of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and displayed banners and placards inscribed with demands like “Stop killing children in Gaza”, “Stop Genocide” and “The United States bears responsibility for the genocide in Palestine”, etc.
Some of the protesters also carried placards, applauding Iran’s retaliatory action against Israel.
Representatives of civil society and human rights organisations including leaders of political and religious parties and minority communities from across the city participated in the protest to express solidarity with the people of Palestine.
PLF Secretary General Dr Sabir Abu Maryam, Jamaat-i-Islami leader Muhammad Hussain Mehnati, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslmaeen’s Allama Baqir Zaidi, leaders of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and other parties and groups were also present.
Addressing the protesters, the speakers praised Iran for being “the only Islamic country” that has carried out historic countermeasures against Israel in 50 years. 
“We pay tribute to the government and leadership of Iran for their courageous action and congratulate them on their successful countermeasures against the murderous usurper Zionist state of Israel,” they added.
The speakers reaffirmed Pakistan’s continued support for Palestine and expressed solidarity with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. 
They denounced the US and Israel for the recent aggression resulting in the tragic loss of Mr Haniyeh’s three sons and extended their heartfelt condolences to him.
The speakers said that the United States was responsible for the killings of Palestinians in Gaza and the protests would continue until the aggression ended. 
The speakers also demanded that the government of Pakistan fight on the international level with a clear and unequivocal stand of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah on the issue of Palestine. They strongly condemned the slow attitude of the government.

7,Street criminal sentenced to eight years in prison,KARACHI: A sessions court has awarded total eight-year imprisonment to a man in a robbery case.,"KARACHI: A sessions court has awarded total eight-year imprisonment to a man in a robbery case.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (East) Ghulam Mustafa Laghari found Umair guilty of committing a robbery and possession of an illegal weapon.
The court pronounced its verdict after recording evidence and arguments from both sides. 
In addition to the jail term, the judge imposed fines of a total of Rs15,000 on the convict and in case of default, he would undergo an additional two-month imprisonment.
The court took a lenient view in awarding sentence due to the convict’s young age and the fact that he was a first-time offender.
Throughout the trial, the accused denied the allegations levelled against him. However, during cross-examination, the court noted that the accused failed to establish a case of false implication. 
“No glaring contradiction was found by the accused to warrant the extension of the benefit of the doubt to him,” the court ruled.
The verdict read, “Even though all the material witnesses are independent, their evidence is corroborated and consistent with each other, and at no point was their testimony shaken by the accused.”
According to the prosecution, the complainant informed the police that last year she along with her son went to the Superior Science College in Shah Faisal Colony for his admission. However, two young men approached them, held them at gunpoint and snatched their mobile phones and valuables. 
Fortunately, a police patrol arrived at the scene upon hearing the complainant’s call for help. The police chased and apprehended both the suspects, identified as Umair and underage suspect Aftab. After a search, the police recovered a .30-bore pistol and five live bullets from Umair.
During the investigation, the mother of the co-accused, Aftab, produced his birth certificate, which revealed that he was 16. Consequently, the investigation officer presented him before the concerned judicial magistrate, who remanded him to jail. The IO also separately submitted a challan before a juvenile court.
State prosecutor Zulfiqar Ali Shah presented four witnesses to support the case against the accused. 
Two cases were registered at the Shah Faisal Colony police station under Sections 397 of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 23 (i) of the Sindh Arms Act 2013.
Bail granted
A sessions court granted bail to a man facing trial in a case pertaining to the killing of an official of the Sindh Bar Council (SBC) Gulistan-i-Jauhar in Dec 2021.
Former SBC secretary Irfan Mehar was targeted by gunmen near Chapal Plaza in Block-13.
Applicant Ghulam Akbar, who is victim’s brother-in-law, filed a post-arrest bail application before Additional District and Sessions Judge Abdul Zahoor Chandio. 
After recording arguments, the judge granted him bail against a surety bond of Rs500,000.
“The applicant is entitled to bail in line with the rule of consistency. Under these circumstances, it is my humble estimation that the applicant has presented a strong case for bail,” the court order stated.
During proceedings, the applicant’s counsel highlighted that the FIR was filed against unknown individuals. Additionally, co-accused Wajid Hussain and Rahim Bux were granted bail by the Sindh High Court, along with the victim’s wife.
The counsel argued that despite 27 months of incarceration, no evidence had been presented against the suspect, with 16 witnesses examined by the prosecution.
In response, the complainant’s counsel opposed the bail application, acknowledging that the suspects’ names were not initially mentioned in the complaint. However, he argued that the applicant’s sister instigated her brother to allegedly murder his husband over an alleged property dispute.

The 19 dead were among around 70 people who had left the village on Wednesday for the shrine of revered saint Syed Bilawal Shah Noorani, popularly known as ‘Shah Noorani’ in Khuzdar town of Balochistan. The overcrowded truck overturned and plunged into a roadside ditch near Hub late in the evening. Many of the travellers fell off the truck and about two scores of them were crushed under it. Thirteen people died on the spot and five others, among the around 50 injured, died during emergency medical treatment. One family had lost its 12 members in the accident and some other members were receiving treatment at hospitals. On Sunday, another family member, Mohammad Rafique, 32, son of Imam Dino Jokhio, also succumbed to his injuries leading the total death toll in the tragedy to 19. 
Touching scenes were witnessed when several hundred relatives of the bereaved families and members of their community visited their homes again on Sunday after hearing the death of Rafiq Jokhio. They took part in the funeral. 
The bereaved families and many of their other relatives earn their livelihood through brick kilns and stone crushing machines functioning along the outer boundary walls of the Thatta Cement Factory and its close proximity.
Mourners share feelings and views
Some of the mourners at the condolence gathering were hugging the loudly crying bereaved relatives and many other grief-struck visitors were trying to console them. 
Gul Hassan Jokhio, a representative of Qasim Jokhio village residents, lamented the lack of road safety measures pointing out that thousands of people travel through this route for the annual pilgrimage of Shah Noorani. No security measures were seen either even after the 2016 bomb blast at the shrine that had claimed 52 lives, he deplored.
MNA Sadiq Ali Memon and MPAs Syed Riaz Hussain Shah Shirazi and Haji Ali Hassan Zardari were among the prominent figures who attended the gathering. They had also provided financial assistance to the bereaved families soon after the accident.
Former MNA Babu Ghulam Hussain has proposed more financial assistance out of the handouts collected by the Auqaf department at the shrine.

They demanded fixing of wheat support price at Rs5,000 per 40kg.
The protesters also demanded raising of wheat procurement target set at 900,000 tonnes. 
They noted that the it was far lower than the previous year’s target of 1.4 million tonnes. They insisted that the target should be at least 1.7 million tonnes.
AT media secretary Kashif Mallah, Advocate Najeebur Rehman Mahesar, Atif Mallah, Hadi Dino Khuharo, Hizballah Khoso and other party leaders from Dadu district led the rally, which started from Community Centre and culminated outside the press club in KN Shah.
Speaking on the occasion, the protest leaders criticised the government’s treatment meted out to farmers, alleging that the traders backed by the Sindh government exploited farmers by purchasing wheat at low prices and reselling it to the food department at the rates fixed by the government.
They condemned government’s alleged failure to open wheat procurement centres and accused it of extending undue favours to influential businessmen and wheat traders, 
leaving small farmers (abadgars) at their mercy. 
They also accused the Sindh government of facilitating wheat smuggling by fixing low target and depriving growers of gunny bags, thus forcing abadgars to sell their produce at lower prices.
The leaders decried mismanagement of irrigation resources, highlighting neglect of canals in Khairpur Nathan Shah for years despite it being under the legal jurisdiction of the irrigation department. 
They expressed their concern over the lack of progress in repair work of the canals damaged during the 2022 flood, despite allocation of significant funds for their reconstruction.
The AT leaders stressed an urgent need to address these issues, highlighting their detrimental impact on the livelihoods of farmers and other people.
They said: “The amendment to the Irsa Act is viewed as a symbol of martial law and reminiscent of the ‘One Unit’ rule. This ordinance is deemed unconstitutional and perceived as an assault on the principles outlined in the 18th Constitutional Amendment. Consequently, it is imperative to halt the implementation of this ordinance”.

Talking to reporters during his visit to Sukkur Civil Hospital the other day, he said inflation was a problem for all and the opposition could not save its skin by launching a movement against it because it was they who were behind the storm of price hike.
“We are fighting inflation and will neither run away like Imran Khan nor will we make phony or tall promises with people,” he said.
He added that they could not, like Imran, claim to bring $200 billion to control inflation; however, the dollar rate would come down in the country, and the government would have to pay special attention towards the agricultural sector for three to four years, and after that they would be able to control inflation.
He further said that due to the prolonged period of the previous caretaker government, all problems were created, and they were facing the worst impact of these issues.
Mr Shah said the interim set-up was responsible for deterioration in the law and order situation in Sindh as the caretakers had failed to pay attention towards the issue.
Mr Shah said that peace could not be restored in the province unless the Sindh police were supplied modern weapons.
Asked about the better medical facilities at Sukkur Civil Hospital, he said he would talk to the newly-appointed MS of the health facility and the principal of the Ghulam Mohammad Medical College.
Talking about the Gaza situation, he said that it was the duty of every Muslim to support Palestinians.
Israel had been trying to crush Muslims, and America had adopted a hypocritical attitude in supporting Israel, said the PPP leader.

13,Six killed in rain-related accidents as thunder claps frighten Karachiites,"Lightning strikes house in Naya Nazimabad, no one hurt; Surjani Town sees most rain.","• Lightning strikes house in Naya Nazimabad, no one hurt
• Surjani Town sees most rain
• Light showers may continue today
KARACHI: Six people were killed in two rain-related traffic accidents as Karachi and its outskirts received light to moderate showers on Sunday.
The people of Karachi woke up to thunders and lightning, which led to rainfall in different parts of the city. As the shower count stayed light to moderate, the thunders and lightning triggered fears among residents.
The power supply system of a house in Naya Nazimabad was struck by lightning but luckily, no one was hurt in the incident.
Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz said the combination of sea breeze with cold winds had increased the chances of ‘tornadoes and lightning’ which were witnessed in the fresh rain spell.
Although the system had lost its intensity, he said, it could still cause light rains early on Monday.
Surjani Town received the highest amount of rain which was 29 millimetres, or 1.14 inches, followed by Nazimabad with 21.2mm, Gulshan-i-Hadeed 20mm, Keamari and PAF Base Faisal 19mm each, PAF Masroor Base 18mm, University Road 15.7mm and Saadi Town 15mm. The other parts of the city received rains in single digit count.
After the rain the city temperature dropped to 27 degree Celsius with 83 per cent humidity.
A Met office advisory says that the city weather is likely to stay ‘mostly cloudy’ on Monday (today) but expected to turn ‘hot and humid’ on Tuesday (tomorrow).
Five die as coach overturns on motorway
Five persons, including two children, were killed and 20 others injured when an apparently fast-moving passenger coach overturned on M-9 motorway near Karachi due to rain on Sunday.
Officials said that the passenger coach was on its way from Karachi to Larkana and the incident took place near Jokhio Mor.
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that three persons, including two children, were brought dead at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.
An Edhi Foundation spokesperson said that two more persons, aged between 30 and 35 years, were shifted to a private hospital, where doctors declared them dead.
Girl dies
In Baldia Town, a 10-year-old girl was killed and her relative injured when their motorcycle slipped due to rain.
Officials said that the incident took place on Suparco Road. The body was shifted to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.
Power failures
Several areas of the city experienced power outages during rain.
However, the K-Electric claimed that power supply to Karachi remained stable amid intermittent showers.
In a statement, the power utility said that the KE teams continued to closely monitor the situation, maintaining proactive contact with key departments of the government of Sindh, Met office, and the city’s administration, while the field teams remained available to address any faults.
“Over 1,900 feeders of KE’s network of almost 2,100 feeders remained fully energised at any given time. In accordance with emergency safety protocols, power supply to low-lying areas with a risk of water logging and those with a high prevalence of kundas was temporarily suspended. These areas have also been gradually re-energised after clearance from field teams,” it said.
Mayor visits city areas
The civic administration, which claimed to have mobilised its teams and resources two days ago following the Met office forecast, was, to some extent, able to handle the challenge as no major urban flooding incident, that had been seen in the past, was witnessed on Sunday.
“The staff is busy clearing rainwater from [areas] where it has collected,” Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab posted on X (formerly Twitter).
 






A statement issued by his office said that the city mayor visited various areas where he appreciated the teams busy draining out rainwater.
Barrister Wahab said that all staff of the KMC, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation, and Sindh Solid Waste Management Board were present on the ground to tackle the rain situation.
“For the first time, vehicles with suction, jetting and pumping features have also been deputed on major arteries to deal with the situation,” he shared in another post.
Sindh chief secretary Syed Asif Haider Shah, on the other hand, issued high alert for all municipalities, administrative bodies, and hospitals across the province to meet rain related challenges.
