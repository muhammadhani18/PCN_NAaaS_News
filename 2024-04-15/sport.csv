0,"Arsenal, Liverpool rocked as City handed title boost","Arsenal’s first defeat in 12 league games leaves them in second place, while third placed Liverpool are behind Arsenal on goal difference.","LONDON: Arsenal and Liverpool’s Premier League title hopes suffered a massive blow as both the teams lost their respective matches and surrendered the initiative to Manchester City on Sunday.
The Gunners should have been on a high after Liverpool suffered a shock  1-0 defeat against Crystal Palace just half an hour before kick-off in  north London but Aston Villa struck twice in the closing stages against Arsenal to boost their top four bid with a dramatic 2-0 win at the Emirates Stadium.
Mikel Arteta’s side would have gone back to the top of the table with a victory, but Leon Bailey put the visitors ahead and Ollie Watkins doubled their lead as Villa boss Unai Emery enjoyed a second sweet win this season over the club that sacked him in 2019.
Arsenal’s first defeat in 12 league games leaves them in second place, two points behind City, while third placed Liverpool are behind Arsenal on goal difference.
With just six games left, champions City are closing in on an unprecedented fourth successive Premier League crown.
City’s rout of Luton Town on Saturday had knocked Arsenal out of first place.
Arsenal were expected to come out all guns blazing to claim the top position but the Gunners produced a spluttering display that could prove fatal to their challenge for a first English title in 20 years.
It has been a dispiriting week for the Gunners, who were held to a 2-2 draw by Bayern Munich in the Cham­pions League quarter-finals on Tuesday, setting up a tricky trip to Germany for the second leg on Wednesday.
After blowing an eight-point lead in the title race last season, Arsenal are in danger of squandering the advantage yet again.
Villa had moved up to fourth place without kicking a ball after Tottenham Hotspur’s thrashing at Newcastle United on Saturday dropped them below Emery’s men on goal difference.
And Villa’s second win in six league games moved them three points clear of Tottenham, who have a game in hand in the race to qualify for the Champions League via a top four finish.
Arsenal had started brightly and Kai Havertz’s low drive was palmed away by Emiliano Martinez before Gabriel Jesus headed into the side-netting from Bukayo Saka’s cross.
Accelerating onto Martin Odegaard’s pin-point pass, Saka took aim from inside the area, but couldn’t test Martinez from an acute angle.
Arsenal created chances but the superbly-organised Villa remained resolute, reaching half-time on level terms.
The Emirates crowd grew increasingly frustrated as Villa pushed Arsenal back in the closing stages.
And their fears were confirmed in the 84th minute when Emery’s men snatched the lead.
Lucas Digne’s low cross eluded Arsenal defenders William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes, leaving Bailey with the simple task of slotting into the empty net from close-range.
Two minutes and 26 seconds later, Watkins delivered the knockout blow, stealing the ball from Emile Smith-Rowe and clipping a delicate finish past David Raya for his 10th goal in his last 11 league games.
Emery celebrated with a jubilant jig on the touchline, while Arteta stood ashen-faced as Arsenal faced up to a catastrophic loss.
Earlier, Liverpool’s quest for a Premier League  title in manager Jurgen Klopp’s final season with the team suffered a  huge blow at Anfield after Eberechi Eze scored in the 14th minute to stun the Anfield faithful in the third consecutive disappointing result for Liverpool.
“I would say with the chances we had, we were really unlucky,” Klopp  told the BBC.  “In the second half, Crystal Palace were lucky we didn’t  punish them but that’s why we are stood here with no points and Crystal  Palace have three.”
Tyrick Mitchell found Eze unmarked in the box after a beautiful build-up  of 21 passes and Eze slotted home with his first touch to put Palace  ahead. 
“It’s an outstanding win at Anfield, it’s so difficult to win  here,” Palace boss Oliver Glasner said.  “How they played, especially in  the first half, is so nice to see. In the second half, there was a lot  of pressure from Liverpool. It’s about being able to express yourself and play with  confidence,” he added.
Liverpool, who had 21 shots to Palace’s  eight, squandered a bagful of chances including Curtis Jones’s shot on a  breakaway that he fired wide, tugging his shirt over his head in  disbelief. Liverpool’s talisman Mohamed Salah hammered a close-range strike off a defender in the dying seconds.

1,Ihsanullah to meet surgeon in Manchester,LAHORE: Pakistan pacer Ihsanullah’s rehabilitation from a long-term elbow injury will continue with his ...,"LAHORE: Pakistan pacer Ihsanullah’s rehabilitation from a long-term elbow injury will continue with his appointment with an experienced surgeon in the United Kingdom, the country’s cricket board said on Sunday.
The right-armer, whose injury was mismanaged for most of its part before incumbent Pakistan Cricket Board chairman took notice of it following shocking revelations by the owner of Pakistan Super League franchise Multan Sultans, for which Ihsanullah plays for.   
“Fast bowler Ihsanullah left for Manchester, England, on Sunday morning for his crucial appointment on Monday with esteemed orthopedic surgeon, Professor Adam Watts, regarding his elbow injury,” said a PCB press release. 
“Professor Watts specialises in hand and wrist surgery, shoulder and elbow procedures, sports injuries, and trauma surgery.
“Ihsanullah’s franchise, Multan Sultans, has collaborated with the PCB to secure this appointment. The PCB, as Ihsanullah’s parent body, will cover all expenses for his treatment and rehabilitation.”
Ihsanullah, 21, made a big impact in last year’s Pakistan Super League with his pace and subsequently went on to make his debut in three T20 matches against Afghan­istan in Sha­r­jah and two ODIs at home against New Zealand.
But after the New Zealand series, he suffered an elbow injury and was sidelined for remaining events including the Asia Cup and World Cup.
Unfortunately for the youngster, an incorrect diagnosis of his injury and a botched-up surgery in Lahore has meant he is yet to recover completely.

2,"Scheffler takes charge at Masters, Woods struggles","With a win, Scheffler would become the 18th player to win the Masters multiple times and the first to accomplish the feat since Bubba Watson in 2014.","

SCOTTIE Scheffler of the United States plays his shot from the 18th tee during the third round of the Masters tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club.—AFP

 
AUGUSTA: Scottie Scheffler birdied his final hole to emerge from a packed leaderboard and grab a one-shot lead over Collin Morikawa after the third round of the Masters while Tiger Woods endured his worst major round as a professional on Saturday.
Scheffler, who used a back-nine eagle to get his round back on track, carded a one-under-par 71 on a firm and fast Augusta National layout to reach seven under on the week and in position to win a second Masters.
With a win, Scheffler would become the 18th player to win the Masters multiple times and the first to accomplish the feat since Bubba Watson in 2014.
“Being patient out there I think is really important,” said Scheffler.  “Especially on a day like today. It was a frustrating day to be playing this golf course. It was so challenging.”
Morikawa, who is seeking the third leg of the career Grand Slam of golf’s four majors, began his day with three consecutive was alone in second place after a three-under-par 69 that was one shot off the day’s low round.
Max Homa (73), who along with LIV Golf’s Bryson DeChambeau (75) held a share of the halfway lead with Scheffler, was a further shot back in third while Ludvig Aberg (70) of Sweden was three shots off the lead in his major championship debut.
DeChambeau, who struggled with his putting most of the day, drove it into the trees at the par-four 18th, pitched out to the fairway and then holed out from 77 yards for an unlikely birdie that put a spring in his step.
“I just figured was easier than putting,” joked DeChambeau.
Scheffler had dropped out of the lead after a shaky start to the back nine where he followed a double-bogey at the par-four 10th with a bogey at the 11th.
But an unflustered Scheffler joined Morikawa atop the leaderboard with a 31-foot eagle putt at the par-five 13th where his approach shot looked ready to settle some 10 feet from the hole before it suddenly gathered speed rolled away.
“I didn’t know whether or not it was going to get there, and it kind of just nudged right over the edge and went in,” said Scheffler.  “So it was exciting, and it was nice to be able to steal a couple shots there on 13 and get back in the tournament.”
Scheffler then picked up another stroke at the par-five 15th where he got up and down for birdie after his approach shot from 238 yards sped right off the back of the green and then offset his bogey at 17 with an eight-foot birdie at the last.
Denmark’s Nicolai Hojgaard, who like Aberg is seeking to become the first Masters rookie to win a Green Jacket since 1979, was leading after three birdies around the turn but then made five consecutive bogeys to slide down the leaderboard.
Woods, fresh off his Masters record-setting 24th made cut, began his third round seven shots behind the leaders and hoping his injury-ravaged body would hold up and allow him to move into contention.
But Woods looked worn out from playing 23 holes on Friday and suffered an unwanted personal milestone with a 10-over-par 82 that tied the day’s highest round.
“Just hit the ball in all the places that I know I shouldn’t hit it,” said Woods.  “And I missed a lot of putts. Easy, makeable putts.”
Following a three-putt bogey at the par-three fourth, Woods drained a fist pump-inducing birdie putt from 19 feet at the fifth before he suddenly started to unravel.
Woods bogeyed the par-three sixth after his tee shot landed behind the green, 
made a double-bogey at the seventh where he chipped into a bunker, carded another double at the eighth and a bogey at nine where his approach found another sand trap.
The 15-times major winner then mixed five bogeys with a lone birdie on the closing stretch.
Rory McIlroy, who began the day 10 shots off the lead and seeking a low score to boost his hopes of completing the career Grand Slam of golf’s four majors, carded a one-under-par 71.
“All I can do is come here and try my best. That’s what I do every time I show up. Some years it’s better than others,” said world number two McIlroy. “I’ve just got to keep showing up and try to do the right thing.”

3,Vinales wins Grand Prix of the Americas sprint,"“I want to keep going. The level was amazing,” said Maverick Vinales, punching the air, before stepping up to the podium.","AUSTIN: Maverick Vinales leapt away from pole position and cruised to victory in the MotoGP sprint race at the Grand Prix of the Americas in Austin on Saturday.
The Spaniard, who smashed the lap record in qualifying, built a lead of more than a second on his Aprilia and rode serenely to the line as behind him three compatriots fought for the other podium places.
“I want to keep going. The level was amazing,” said Vinales, punching the air, before stepping up to the podium.
Vinales completed the 10 laps in 20 minutes 27.825 seconds, 2.294sec ahead of seven-times winner at the Circuit of the Americas, Marc Marquez on a Gresini Ducati.
Jorge Martin increased his championship lead with third on a Pramac Ducati, 4.399sec behind the winner while teenage rookie Pedro Acosta, on a GasGas, was fourth.
Marquez said he was not entirely happy with his performance.
“Was a bit harder than I expected,” he said. “In the first lap I was quite strong but then I start to feel not so good.
“Then I decide to wait for my moment. I was in front of the group. When Pedro attacked me, I said ‘OK, now is the time’. I was half a second faster in the next lap and then I opened a gap.” 
Martin crashed twice in morning qualifying and started from the second row of the grid.
“This morning we took crashes,” he said, adding that he too had had problems during the race. “Today was a tough race. I struggled quite a lot in the middle of the race with some issues but to finish on the podium is amazing. We are super-constant. This is the most important thing.” 
The other Aprilia rider, Spaniard Aleix Espargaro, was fifth with Italian Enea Bastianini sixth for factory Ducati.
Italian double reigning world champion Francesco Bagnaia, who performed an unintended wheelie at the start and lost momentum, was eighth.
Martin moved to 67 points in the championship, 24 ahead of Bastianini.
South African Brad Binder, who was 12th on a KTM, is another point behind.
The battle resumes on Sunday in the 20-lap main race Marquez said he needed to handle some of the corners better. 
“Let’s see that turn one where we can improve to keep up with Vinales,” he said Martin ws also trying to work out how to keep pace with Vinales. “Tomorrow let’s go for a better race,” he said.

4,Juventus title hopes over after Torino stalemate,TURIN: Juventus’ hopes of wining the Italian Serie A title ended after a 0-0 draw at city rivals Torino on...,"TURIN: Juventus’ hopes of wining the Italian Serie A title ended after a 0-0 draw at city rivals Torino on Saturday.
Juventus are third in the standings on 63 points from 32 games with six matches left to play, 19 behind leaders Inter Milan.
Record 36-times Italian champions Juve won the title nine times in a row from 2012-2020 but have not lifted the trophy since.
“It’s a point... we accept it,” Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri told a news conference. “There’s always the disappointment of not having scored three, but if we hadn’t lost (more) games we would have been in a better place. Today we take it, we have to improve things.”
They remained winless on the road since late January, when they beat Lecce 3-0, and have gone five away games in a row without victory in a single domestic season for the first time since 2010.
Dusan Vlahovic wasted two chances to give Juve the lead in the first half, hitting the post from point blank range and putting Torino keeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic to work with a shot into the far corner.
The game turned into a more lively derby when Torino forward Duvan Zapata thought he had broken the deadlock for the hosts one minute after the interval, but his effort was ruled out for a foul in the buildup.
Torino continued to press as the second half wore on and Juventus keeper Wojciech Szczesny was forced to dive to save an Antonio Sanabria header.
Juventus ended their longest ongoing streak of scoring away go­a­ls against a single opponent hav­ing netted in each of their previous 15 games at Torino in Serie A.
Ninth-placed Torino, on 45 points, are now the team with the most Serie A clean sheets at home (11) this season.
Meanwhile, fourth-place Bolo­gna were also held to a goalless stalemate against Monza on an uneventful evening in Italy’s top flight.
Bologna dropping points for the second straight week left third-placed Juve four points ahead of Bologna.
Bologna are trying for a first-ever spot in the Champions League,  although they played one round in the old European Cup in 1964, the same  year that they most recently won Serie A.
Earlier, Nicola Sansone’s late strike gave Lecce a 1-0 win over fellow strugglers Empoli.
Sansone  rolled the decisive goal into an empty net with a minute remaining in  southern Italy, moving Lecce up to 13th and six points above the drop  zone.

LEVERKUSEN: Bayer Leverkusen fans celebrate on the pitch following the Bundesliga match against Werder Bremen at BayArena on Sunday.—AFP ]1
LEVERKUSEN: Bayer Lever­kusen lifted the Bundesliga title for the first time in their 120-year history on Sunday, a 5-0 victory over Werder Bremen breaking Bayern Munich’s 11-year stranglehold on the German top flight.
Xabi Alonso’s Leverkusen knew victory would secure the title with five games to spare, but there were no signs of nerves in a dominant performance.
A hat-trick from Florian Wirtz and goals from Victor Boniface and Granit Xhaka extended their unbeaten run to a stunning 43 games in all competitions.
Leverkusen’s maiden title, coming after five second-place finishes in their history, keeps their dream of a remarkable treble alive while shedding their unwanted ‘Neverkusen’ nickname for good.
With 10 minutes to go, the long-suffering fans began making their way to the sidelines and a few jumped the gun, storming the pitch with the match still ongoing.
Leverkusen’s players ushered the fans back and some obliged, albeit briefly, with the stands swiftly emptying on the 90-minute mark as tearful fans made their way onto the grass to celebrate with the players.
Leverkusen are now on 79 points — the best tally after 29 games in German league history — and are 16 clear of second-placed Bayern and third-placed Stuttgart.
The Leverkusen bus arrived at the stadium 90 minutes before kick-off, wading through a sea of fans clad in black and red on the way to the 30,000-capacity BayArena.


BAYER Leverkusen’s Granit Xhaka scores against Werder Bremen during their match on Sunday.—Reuters

 
Normally known as Bismarck Street, fans had stuck temporary signs saying ‘Xabi Alonso Street’ along the main road in honour of the club’s coach.
Alonso looked ahead to Thur­sday’s Eur­opa League trip to Lon­don to face West Ham United, ma­k­­ing seven changes to his starting XI and benching stars Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Alex Grimaldo, the latter for the first time in the league this season.
Piero Hincapie, Grimaldo’s replacement, had an early effort at goal saved but it would be the fit-again Boniface, making his first start since mid-December, who put the home side in front.
With 22 minutes gone, Jonas Hofmann was felled in the box by Bremen’s Julian Malatini, with the referee pointing to the spot after VAR urged him to view the contact again on the monitor.
Boniface stepped up and nervelessly slotted the penalty past a helpless Michael Zetterer to send the home fans into raptures.
Bremen started the second-half strongly but their hopes of spoiling the party were snuffed out on the 60-minute mark, Boniface finding Xhaka who unleashed a long-range rocket before slapping his badge in front of the ecstatic home fans.
Wirtz, who came on at half-time for Adli, replicated Xhaka’s effort eight minutes later from almost the same spot on the pitch.
Wirtz added another with sev­en minutes remaining before sea­ling his hat-trick in the 90th minute as Leverkusen rid themselves of their nearly men tag in style.
Earlier on Sunday, a 36th-minute goal from Ritsu Doan took Freiburg to a 1-0 win at Darmstadt, pushing the last-placed hosts closer to immediate relegation.
Winless since October and with only two victories all year, the loss leaves Darmstadt dead last, eight points from second-last and 13 points from safety with five games remaining.
On Saturday, Bayern Munich struck twice in the second half to earn a 2-0 win over  Cologne and bounce back from two straight league losses  ahead of their Champions League return leg against Arsenal next week.
With Bundesliga race already decided, Bayern’s only  hope of silverware this season rests with the Champions League following  their 2-2 draw in the first leg in London.
They suffered a  serious injury blow, however, with winger Kingsley Coman taken off in  the 50th minute and ruled out for several weeks with an adductor muscle  injury.
With five league matches left, Bayern are second in the Bundesliga on  63 points. VfB Stuttgart in third, joined them on 63 after their 3-0  win over Eintracht Frankfurt.
RB Leipzig, 3-0 winners over VfL Wolfsburg, are fourth on 56, ahead on goal difference of Boru­ssia Dortmund, who downed Bor­u­ssia Moenchengladbach 2-1.
Elsewhere on Saturday, Mainz boosted their chances of beating the drop, coming  from behind  to beat Hoffenheim 4-1, one point  behind Bochum, who drew 1-1 at home with Heiden­heim. Bochum sit in  15th, the final safe spot.

Raducanu, ranked 302nd in the world as she continues her comeback from double wrist surgery, withstood an incredible Parry fightback to seal a 4-6 6-1 7-6 (1) win.
Katie Boulter had earlier beaten Clara Burel 7-5 6-0 to put Britain 2-1 ahead before Raducanu finished the job with her second impressive win of the tie.
Britain’s first-ever win over France away was all the more notable as it was on clay which is a surface not ideally suited to either Boulter or Raducanu.
They now go through to the 12-nation finals in Spain later in the year where they will be joined by the other winners from the weekend’s qualifiers including Australia and Poland.
Australia were too strong for Mexico, winning 4-0, while Poland, with world number one Iga Swiatek posting a couple of singles wins, crushed Switzerland 4-0.
Slovakia beat Slovenia to book their place in Seville while Naomi Osaka’s Japan beat Kazakhstan.
Last year’s champions Canada, runners-up Italy, host nation Spain and wildcard Czechia, were already assured of their placed in the finals that will be held in Seville.
The 21-year-old Raducanu slipped a set behind against Parry but took control with some scintillating tennis to sweep through the second set and then move 5-2 ahead in the decider.
Parry saved two match points when Raducanu served at 5-3 and battled back to square the match and then failed to convert break points to lead 6-5 in the decider.
Raducanu, who has struggled with form and injuries since her fairytale U.S. Open title in 2021, found an extra gear in the tiebreak to spark celebrations from the British contingent.
“Being a set down, I was backed up against a wall and I didn’t want to go to the doubles because they’re a very strong doubles team,” Raducanu, who beat Caroline Garcia on Friday also from a set down to level the tie, said.
“Boults helped us go 2-1 up and (we had) the support on the bench to help us go out again. “It’s a massive shout-out — it is not just me out there.”

9,Real see off Mallorca to stay on title course,MADRID: Aurelien Tchouameni’s long-range strike earned Real Madrid a 1-0 victory over Mallorca on Saturday that...,"MADRID: Aurelien Tchouameni’s long-range strike earned Real Madrid a 1-0 victory over Mallorca on Saturday that kept them eight points clear of Barcelona at the top of La Liga ahead of the upcoming Clasico.
The France midfielder, who is suspended for the second leg of Real’s Champions League quarter-final away to Manchester City next week, scored three minutes into the second half with a deflected 25-metre drive.
Jude Bellingham rattled the crossbar in the first half with a rasping effort from just outside the area as coach Carlo Ancelotti reshuffled his attack with Wednesday’s trip to England in mind, leaving out Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo.
Tchouameni’s third goal of the season put Real ahead, with Brahim Diaz denied a second by the legs of Mallorca goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic and Fede Valverde’s attempt cleared off the line.
Vinicius appeared off the bench for the last 30 minutes but Rodrygo and Toni Kroos were unused substitutes after a thrilling 3-3 draw with City in Tuesday’s first leg.
Sergi Darder’s spectacular dipping shot forced a flying stop from Andriy Lunin as Los Blancos extended their unbeaten league run to 25 games, keeping Barcelona a safe distance behind ahead of next week’s Clasico in the Spanish capital.
“It’s a very important victory, which brings us closer to the title. We’re on a good run and now we’re going to think about Wednesday, that we have time to recover well and try to do our best,” said Ancelotti. “Having an advantage before (next) Sunday’s game is very important and that was the goal.”
Copa del Rey runners-up Mallorca stay in 15th, six points above the relegation zone.
In Saturday’s later match, Barcelona, who are desperately trying to force their way back into the title race, matched Real’s result with a 1-0 win of their own at third-bottom Cadiz.
Joao Felix’s clever overhead late in the first half secured the points as coach Xavi Hernandez made sweeping changes to the team that beat Paris St-Germain 3-2 in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.
The Portugal international led the attack in the absence of the suspended Robert Lewandowski, acrobatically hooking in the only goal after a Cadiz defender’s looping header from a corner fell directly to him.
“I guess this stadium gives me luck. It wasn’t planned, I just reacted  and it happened. What a great feeling it was and even better with a win  this time,” Felix told Movistar Plus+.
Fermin Lopez had an effort scrambled off the line and Marc-Andre ter Stegen’s sprawling save to claw away a Diadie Samassekou piledriver preserved a sixth successive clean sheet in the league for the visitors.
The win moved Barca two points ahead of third-placed Girona, who lost 3-1 at fourth-placed Atletico Madrid earlier on Saturday.
Antoine Griezmann scored twice as Diego Simeone’s men moved to within four points of their opponents.Atle­tico won the home leg of their European tie 2-1 on Wedn­esday and visit Dortmund for the second leg on Tuesday.
Elsewhere, Rayo Vallecano and Getafe drew 0-0.

10,Ruud ends Djokovic jinx in Monte Carlo to set up Tsitsipas title clash,"MONTE CARLO: Casper Ruud finally defeated Novak Djokovic at the sixth attempt on Saturday, setting up a Monte Carlo...","MONTE CARLO: Casper Ruud finally defeated Novak Djokovic at the sixth attempt on Saturday, setting up a Monte Carlo Masters title showdown with Stefanos Tsitsipas.
Norwegian eighth seed Ru­ud, who had been swept off court by the world number one in a demoralising French Open final loss last year, came through 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 in his semi-final when Djokovic double-faulted after saving two match points.
An inspired Tsitsipas handed world number two Jannik Sin­ner just his second loss of the season as the two-time champion Greek booked his place in Sunday’s final, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.
“I’m super-happy, this is a day I will remember for a really long time,” said Ruud who had never taken a set off Djokovic in their five previous meetings. “I’ve ne­­v­er beaten Novak and I’ve never beaten a world number one. I’m still in a little bit of shock.” 
Ruud and Djokovic traded breaks in the final set, with the Norwegian getting the final word when Djokovic blinked first after just over two and a quarter hours.
“I was up and he came back, the top guys are good under pressure,” Ruud said. “I was just hoping the match would not slip away.
“In the last game I was hoping something or someone up above was listening... I was so happy to see that last ball sail along.” 
Djokovic was competing in his first semi-final in Monte Carlo since he lifted his second title in 2015. He was hoping to reach a 59th Masters final. “Congratulations to Casper. He played really good, especially in the beginning of the first and third set,” said the 36-year-old top seed.
“Of course I’m disappointed now, to lose a match like this... it was a close one.” 
‘GREAT DAY’
Tsitsipas’ victory ended the nine-match winning streak of Australian Open champion Sinner who also has titles in Rotterdam and Miami to his name this season.
“Today was a great day, I’m hoping for a good recovery and a fresh mind,” said Tsitsipas. Sinner began the final set, during which he was twice treated for a right knee injury, with a break of serve.
But he lost it in the eighth game after saving four break points which allowed Tsitsipas to level at 4-4.
The Greek then finished it off by playing what he called “tennis at the highest level that I’ve been able to play recently”.
Tsitsipas, ranked 12th, won the title in Monte Carlo in 2021 and 2022 and declared he is returning to top form after falling out of the top 10.
“It will help my confidence to have a win like this. I’m aiming for the top level again.” 
Tsitsipas secured the opening set with a break in the third game, but the Italian put up a fight to level in the second.
Sinner broke on the way to a 3-0 lead and fought to save five break points in a 13-minute marathon final game before squaring the match on his second set point.
Sinner said a poor third-set line call caused him to cramp up and lose focus.
Instead of a double-fault being called, which would have given the Italian a double break, the point played on, with Tsitsipas holding serve for 2-3.
After two more games, Sinner called for the trainer.
“It’s hard to accept it,” the Italian second seed said of the call.  “I was playing really well at that time.”  “Everyone can make a mistake. Afterwards, I had cramps, most likely because of what happened, because it also affects your nerves.”

11,Azhar to join Pakistan camp today,"Rawalpindi will host the first three matches of the series before action shifts to Lahore, before it culminated with the last T20 on April 21.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s head coach for the side’s upcoming five-match Twenty20 International series against New Zealand Azhar Mahmood will join the team’s camp on Monday.
Former Pakistan all-rounder Azhar, who is based out of London, is set to arrive in Rawalpindi just ahead of the national side’s first practice session three days before the first T20 at the Pindi Cricket Stadium, an official of the country’s cricket board told Dawn.
Azhar was appointed as head coach solely for the series as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) searches for foreign coaches to serve in separate red-ball and white-ball roles in the long-term.
Pakistan have been boosted by the return of veteran pacer Mohammad Amir and seasoned all-rounder Imad Wasim, both rescinding their retirements ahead of the series following talks with the PCB.
The board had also successfully convinced Pakistan-born United Arab Emirates batter Usman Khan to give up his potential opportunity of playing for the middle eastern country after his blistering show with the bat in the Pakistan Super League last month and had included him in the squad.
Babar Azam will return as the Pakistan captain after a being reappointed in the position at the expense of pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi, who was stripped off the role only after five matches in charge – a 4-1 defeat against the BlackCaps away from home.
While Pakistan go into the series with a full-strength squad, New Zealand, who arrived here late on Saturday night, have been depleted by the absence of as many as 10 first-choice players, most of whom are participating in the ongoing Indian Premier League.
The Kiwis, captained by all-rounder Michael Bracewell, will hold their first practice session on Tuesday, after a day’s rest.
Tom Blundell and uncapped all rounder Zak Foulkes were added as late ups to the Kiwis squad after Finn Allen and senior pacer Adam Milne were injured on the eve of their departure.
Rawalpindi will host the first three matches of the series before action shifts to Lahore, before it culminated with the last T20 on April 21. The series marks the start of Pakistan’s build-up to the T20 World Cup, which is set to be held in the United States and the West Indies in June.
New Zealand are visiting Pakistan for the third time in the last 17 months.

12,Alcaraz’s French Open build-up suffers blow,BARCELONA: Carlos Alcaraz’s hopes of a third successive Barcelona Open title have been dashed as he withdrew from...,"BARCELONA: Carlos Alcaraz’s hopes of a third successive Barcelona Open title have been dashed as he withdrew from the tournament on Sunday due to a right arm injury, organisers announced.
It is the same injury that forced Alcaraz to pull out of this week’s Monte Carlo Masters and comes just weeks away from the French Open.
“Despite having tried until the last moment, he will not be in the Barcelona Open,” read an organisers’ statement.
Alcaraz will set his sights on the Madrid Open — it runs from April 24 to May 5 — which he has also won on the past two occasions.
The 20-year-old is yet to add a French Open crown to his US Open (2022) and Wimbledon titles (2023), his best performance a semi-final last year.
The French Open begins on May 20.
As top seed in Barcelona he would have had a bye into the second round — a luxury not afforded to his superstar compatriot Rafael Nadal.
The 37-year-old has been given a wild card invite on his return to the ATP Tour for the first time since a hip injury flared up in January.
The 22-time Grand Slam champion has played just once, in an exhibition match against Alcaraz, since his quarter-final defeat by Jordan Thompson in the Brisbane Open.
Nadal missed virtually all of the 2023 season through injury and has dropped to No.646 in the world rankings.
The injury in Brisbane prompted his withdrawal from the Australian Open as well as Doha and Indian Wells, where he had first intended to make his comeback.
His one appearance since Brisbane came in an exhibition match against Alcaraz in Las Vegas in March where observers noted some discomfort in his back.
With this potentially Nadal’s last year on tour, he will be desperate not to miss any more clay court preparation time as he seeks a record-extending 15th French Open title.
“I’m happy to be here, of course, Barcelona is a place that has brought me a great deal of joy, and where I have spent periods of my life,” said Nadal at Saturday’s draw ceremony.
