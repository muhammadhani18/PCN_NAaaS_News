0,Citizens await civic fixes as Eid holidays end,"Despite promises from authorities, water & sanitation complaints remain unaddressed","With the five-day holidays of Eidul Fitr coming to an end on Sunday, all government and private offices and business centres will open Monday [today], restoring the routine life in the twin cities.
Many who had left the cities to celebrate Eid with their loved ones in their ancestral towns and villages returned either on Sunday or Monday morning. However, amidst the return to routine, grievances loom over the cityscape. Complaints are expected from the citizens regarding basic civic facilities of water, streetlights and sanitation.
Not only the government and private institutions were closed, but the business centres were also completely shut down during the five holidays of Eid from Wednesday to Sunday.
On the other hand, no response has been given by the government agencies to the complaints regarding cleanliness and non-supply of drinking water to the citizens due to holidays. The complaints were registered but no action was taken to resolve them.
The complaints and problems faced by citizens regarding Rawalpindi and Chaklala Cantonment Board, Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) and RWMC could not be resolved in time. Although all these organisations made announcements to set up complaint cells and control rooms during Eid, an efficient response could not be found from such centres regarding the complaints of the citizens.
The problem of non-supply of drinking water to the citizens in Rawalpindi City and Cantt also continued during the Eid holidays while the complaints of lack of cleanliness also persisted and darkness prevailed on the roads due to damaged streetlights in many residential areas.
The complaints of the citizens regarding fixing the streetlights could not be resolved. Assurances were given by the staff on duty of institutions to redress the complaints but later on, they were told that their grievances would be resolved after the holidays.
On the other hand, when government institutions open today, there will be an unusual number of people turning to them for their problems.
Talking to The Express Tribune, citizens Muhammad Ishtiaq, Shabbir Ahmed and Salahuddin said: “It is a practice to postpone all work until after Eid in the last 10 days of Ramazan.”
They added that since the holidays had passed therefore the number of people approaching these institutions from Monday onwards to get their issues resolved was also expected to increase.

1,AMTI Board of Governors accused of favouritism,Siting members point out irregularities in ‘defunct’ chairman’s decisions,"The Board of Governors (BoG) of Abbottabad’s Ayub Medical Teaching Institution (AMTI) has been accused of favouring their blue-eyed individuals during consecutive board meetings under its ‘defunct’ chairman and causing huge losses to the national exchequer.
Despite strong opposition by three board members, the BOG chairman has allegedly shown complete disregard for the law.
BoG members Asad Khan Jadoon, Fawad Saleh, and Syed Jafar Shah have boycotted the meetings, terming them unlawful.
They have claimed that he has no legal authority to convene a meeting as the resignation of the BoG chairman has already been accepted by the caretaker K-P chief minister.
“The BoG chairman, ignoring the govt directives as well as members’ stance had called BoG meeting on April 03, 2024, and proceeded with the meeting,” the dissenting members said. The subsequent minutes published on April 8, 2024, revealed major policy and unlawful decisions recorded in the meeting minutes, they added.
“Notably, none of these decisions were made in favour of patient care or the betterment of the hospital, instead, they appeared to benefit specific employees exclusively.”
The three members said this sequence of events underscores serious concerns regarding governance and decision-making processes within Ayub Teaching Hospital.
They further said that the board in one of its meetings created a position for favouring acting Hospital Director Dr Ather Lodhi as Coordination Officer. The controversial move occurred despite the agenda item being deferred three times in previous BoG meetings. 
Dr Ather Lodhi, previously serving as Chief Medical Officer in BS-20, was not only promoted to BS-21 but also had his position re-designated as Coordination Officer BS-21, a designation for which no existing rule or policy permits such an elevation.
The re-designation of positions within the hospital should adhere to proper procedures, including advertising vacancies and filling them through formalities, the members said. “Re-designation can only occur against vacant positions and must follow legal and transparent processes. This unilateral decision reflects a clear case of illegal favouritism towards the hospital director by the BoG, bypassing established protocols and rules governing promotions and re-designations within the hospital hierarchy.”
Moreover, the board improperly upgraded the position of Manager Radiology to BPS-18, as the actual sanctioned position of the officer is Patient Record Manager at BS-17, with no such designation as ""Manager Radiology BS-17"" existing. Subsequently, the Board endorsed the re-designation of the upgraded Manager Radiology position as Manager HR BPS–18 and merged it into the main HR department.

2,Pindi faces food inflation during holidays,"With markets closed & vendors absent, families struggle to afford necessities","The prices of vegetables, fruits, chicken and meat have skyrocketed due to the closure of vegetables, fruits and all wholesale markets in the twin cities for four days as well as the absence of pushcart vendors because of the Eid holidays.
The impoverished households were unable to afford chicken during the first, second and third days of Eid.
As the price control magistrates were on vacation from Tuesday to Sunday, shopkeepers and hawkers exploited the situation by imposing arbitrary prices on essential items such as vegetables, fruits, bread, chicken, meat, and milk. However, on Saturday (today), there is a chance of prices decreasing as the vegetable and fruit wholesale markets resume operations after four days.
During the three-day Eid festivities, the open market offered a range of prices for different food items. Chicken meat was available at Rs800 per kg, mutton at Rs2,400, beef at Rs1,300, milk at Rs220 per litre and yoghurt at Rs230 per kg.
On the first day of Eidul Fitr, there was a new tsunami of inflation in the open market. The items sold included bread for Rs30, naan for Rs35, paratha for Rs60, a cup of tea for Rs80, lemons for Rs400 per kilo, potatoes for Rs90, onions for Rs350, tomatoes for Rs200, garlic for Rs750, ginger for Rs740, cucumber Rs80, carrot Rs50, green coriander Rs70, apples Rs300 to Rs400, banana Rs220 to Rs250 per dozen, oranges Rs400 to Rs450, melon Rs220 per kg, watermelon Rs200, strawberry Rs300 and pomegranate Rs400 per kg.
Many tandoors in the twin cities had to shut down during the Eid holidays. The tandoor, vegetable and chicken sellers had left for their native villages in Azad Kashmir and Murree. However, all the chicken, vegetable, fruit and other markets will resume operations on Saturday [today], leading to a decrease in the prices of all food and essential items.
It is worth noting that the price of chicken reached an all-time high during all three days of Eid.

3,Infrastructure projects imperil snow leopard’s habitat,Report calls for a delicate balance between infrastructure growth & wildlife conservation,"Rapid infrastructure development primarily roads is potentially degrading the Snow leopard (Panthera uncia)’s habitat, resulting in disrupting the big cats' movement and increasing human-wildlife conflict in the Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B) region. The prey species of the Snow leopard such as Himalayan ibex and domestic livestock are also killed due to heavy traffic on the highways.
This has been revealed in WWF-Pakistan’s baseline research study undertaken through the project titled “Building Ecological and Sustainable Transport/Linear Infrastructure for Snow Leopards in the Hindu Kush Karakoram Himalaya Landscape in Pakistan (BEAST)”.
The project was supported by the With Snow Leopards Small Grant (SLSG) initiated by the Tencent Foundation and the Shan Shui Conservation Centre with support from the Huatai Foundation, the Amity Foundation, and the Pecking University Centre for Nature and Society.
The study recommends that there is a need to strike a balance between boosting infrastructure development and conservation of threatened wildlife such as Snow leopards in the region. The report states that the G-B region is home to diverse wildlife including vulnerable Snow leopards.
It was pointed out that the linear infrastructure development, which cuts through the landscape such as roads, has fragmented the Snow leopard habitat. The report found that although linear infrastructure improves national and regional economies, it restricts wildlife movement and poses a threat to the Snow leopards and their prey species such as ungulates.
Focusing on the broader road ecology theme, the study gathered evidence on infrastructure-related threats to Snow leopards and their habitat in the G-B region. It collected data on wildlife-vehicle collisions, investigated the impact of increasing infrastructure on human-wildlife interaction and analysed land use changes in known Snow leopard hotspots over the past 20 years. It covered two major roads namely Karakoram Highway (KKH) and Gilgit-Shandur Road which bisect Snow leopard habitat.
In the backdrop of the surging infrastructure growth in the G-B region, the WWF-Pakistan launched the Sustainable Infrastructure Initiative in 2019 which aimed to build the capacities of relevant stakeholders, raise awareness, and advocate for sustainable and green infrastructure planning and development in the Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) region.
Commenting on the study, Hammad Naqi Khan, the Director General of the WWF-Pakistan said that any infrastructure development project always helped boost trade and tourism, but the environment and species conservation aspects should not be overlooked.
He was of the view that detrimental impacts of the development projects could be avoided through meticulous planning, sustainable infrastructure and an integrated approach which promotes biodiversity conservation and protection of the natural ecosystem. “It’s crucial to build upon this study and undertake further investigations on wildlife movement and migration patterns to assess the impact of the infrastructure development on wildlife populations in critical habitats”, Khan added.
The report further indicated that large-scale transport infrastructure development and burgeoning hospitality projects have posed a threat to the local biodiversity and pristine landscape in G-B.
The report proposed that following the current laws regulating wildlife, linear development, and human encroachment should be prohibited in the protected areas. It also recommended that the construction of wildlife corridors and crossings in potential wildlife habitats could help minimise the access of wildlife to high-traffic roads and could reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions.
It also suggested that the deployment of devoted law enforcement and traffic personnel along wildlife hotspots could help thwart the hunting and poaching of Snow leopards and their prey species. The report also suggested that infrastructure-related development projects should take proactive mitigation steps to safeguard the native ecology and wild species.
Various studies indicate that as Snow leopard is an elusive animal, hence it’s difficult to record its exact population in the distribution range across Central and South Asia. However, a 2020 WWF research indicated that fewer than 7,000 Snow leopards remain globally, of which approximately 200 to 420 individuals inhabit the northern mountain ranges of Pakistan including the G-B region, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), and Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK).

5,Auction process for cattle market begins,"RCB eyes huge sums in revenue, schedules biding for April 18","The Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (CBR) has launched the contract awarding process for the Bhatta Ground Cattle Market ahead of Eidul Fitr. This bustling makeshift market that caters to the needs of the twin cities, is set to welcome vendors and sacrificial animals before Eidul Azha.
According to sources, stringent measures would be taken to ensure compliance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) and maintain disease-free conditions.
The auction for the contract award will kick off with a starting bid of Rs89.5 million, following the pattern of previous contract awards. In 2020, the contract for the Bhatta Ground Cattle Market was initially auctioned for Rs7 million. However, it took a surprising turn when the contractor who acquired the contract re-auctioned it.
This move resulted in the contractor managing to recoup a staggering Rs230 million, which raised concerns among cantonment board officials.
Subsequently, the contract amounts for the following years witnessed significant increases. Rs70 million was collected in 2021, Rs80.6 million in 2022, and finally, Rs89.5 million was collected for 2023. Unfortunately, the contractor vanished shortly after securing the 2023 contract, leaving the cantonment board to pursue independent recovery efforts for the outstanding amount.
Despite these challenges, the cantonment board's efforts to award contracts totalling Rs230 million in the years 2021, 2022, and 2023 were unsuccessful. The board only managed to receive Rs7 million from the 2020 contract for market cattle.
The contract award process for the 2024 market cattle is slated for April 18 and 19. Prospective bidders must submit a call deposit of Rs5 million to participate. Upon winning the contract, an additional 10 per cent of the total amount must be paid.
The market contractor is authorised to levy charges of Rs3,000 for large animals and Rs2,000 for small animals. Additionally, they can impose parking fees for vehicles entering the market, categorised as entry fees.
Furthermore, the contractor is responsible for providing essential services such as water, shade, and sanitation facilities for the animals. They also collect fees based on vehicle type, including Rs4,000 per round for large trolleys, Rs300 per round for Mazda trucks, and Rs200 for small vehicles.
The cantonment board's proactive measures aim to streamline operations at the Bhatta Ground Cattle Market and ensure compliance with regulatory standards for the benefit of market participants and the public.
