0,PPP warns against political wrangling,Bilawal terms opposition alliance PNA 2.0; Zardari says poverty remains in the minds of bureaucracy,"Top leaders of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) asserted on Sunday that the country was poor only in the lowly minds of the bureaucracy in Islamabad, cautioning that opposition parties were clamouring about election rigging to perpetuate economic instability.
Speaking at a public gathering in Garhi Khuda Bux to mark the 45th death anniversary of party founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Co-Chairman President Asif Zardari emphasized the necessity for political figures to unite around a ‘charter of reconciliation’.
“Let’s come together and find common ground,” Zardari proposed. “And if consensus proves elusive,” he continued, “then let's step back and reconsider. Persistent infighting among politicians only leads to public suffering, jeopardizes future generations, and dims the prospects of progress,” he added.
The president urged politicians to be cognizant of the repercussions of their actions, especially concerning future generations. He added that the country suffered permanent and long-term losses because of similar mistakes in the past.
“People are still grappling with the aftermath of those errors,” he remarked, refraining from pinpointing any specific incident. Expressing regret, he lamented that politicians often engage in battles even over matters of public welfare. He underscored that holding power should solely be about serving the masses.
Zardari reiterated that it wasn’t Pakistan’s destiny, nor that of its people, to perennially endure poverty, as the nation is abundantly endowed with resources. “The notion of poverty only exists in the narrow minds of Islamabad’s bureaucracy, which has perpetuated our impoverishment,” he asserted.
In his address, the president also alluded to the Supreme Court's acknowledgment, recognizing that the late Bhutto's conviction followed a mistrial. He expressed satisfaction that his efforts had led to the Supreme Court issuing this ruling.
In his address, Chairman Bilawal criticised the opposition parties, saying that they wanted to revive the former PNA—a reference to the nine-party Pakistan National Alliance formed against the then PPP government led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1977.
He described the nascent opposition grouping as ‘PNA Part Two’. “They are trying to beat the drum of election rigging and in its garb they want to bring political instability once again, and they also want to see the economic instability continue,” he said.
According to BIlawal, the opposition political figures were serving their “egoistic interests” only. He reminded them how a similar movement against his grandfather after the 1977 elections had opened the door for a military dictatorship which lasted for more than 10 years.

“Those nine stars [PNA] believed they could overthrow Bhutto and establish their own government,” he remarked. Warning of the looming threat of military intervention if politicians failed to prioritize national reconciliation and persisted in trading insults, he cautioned against the detrimental consequences.
“It won’t foster Pakistan’s development or strengthen its economy; rather, it will only undermine democracy and harm the people,” Bilawal conveyed to the audience. He urged political leaders to abandon confrontations, verbal attacks, and sit-in protests, and instead engage in constructive political dialogue at the table.
He believed that only through dialogue could politicians effect improvements in the system without inflicting harm on the people. “Democracy is our politics; and people are the fountain of power, and to this day, the PPP adheres to these fundamental principles,” he emphasized.
Bilawal underscored the necessity for judicial reforms, noting that 90% of the Charter of Democracy (CoD) points had been accomplished, with only the remaining 10% pertaining to the judiciary. He also addressed the historic low in people's trust in the institution, stating, ""We must work to restore this trust.”
Referring to the apex court’s opinion on Bhutto’s conviction, Bilawal said it took the court 45 years after the conviction of Bhutto and 12 years after the filing of the presidential reference to come to some justice-based conclusion.
He emphasised that the purpose of the judicial reforms is to expedite the dispensation of justice to the people.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, PPP Sindh’s President MPA Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, former
Sindh CM Syed Qaim Ali Shah and other leaders also expressed their views on the occasion.

1,Naqvi suspects Indian hand in Amir Tamba attack,Minister cites India's alleged implication in four previous murder incidents as grounds for suspicion in this case,"Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has said that there are suspicions of Indian involvement in the recent attack on Amir Tamba, a suspect linked to the murder of Indian prisoner Sarabjit Singh in Kot Lakhpat jail back in 2013.
Tamba succumbed to gunshot wounds sustained during an assault at his residence in Lahore’s Islampura on Sunday.
Addressing reporters at a news conference held at the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) regional office in Lahore on Monday, Naqvi said that while the police are actively probing the assault on Tamba, strong indications are pointing towards Indian involvement.
Naqvi cited India's alleged implication in four previous murder incidents similar to Tamba's as grounds for suspicion in this case.
Naqvi stressed the importance of refraining from conclusive statements until the investigation concludes, yet he underscored the apparent pattern linking these attacks to India.
In a separate incident last October, unidentified assailants fatally shot Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) leader Shahid Latif and his security guards in a mosque in Daska. Latif was accused of orchestrating the 2016 Pathankot airbase attack.
Furthermore, in June 2021, a car bombing outside the residence of Hafiz Saeed, leader of the banned Jamatul Dawat (JeD), resulted in multiple casualties. Pakistan had previously accused India's state agency RAW of involvement in these attacks.

Switching topics, Naqvi addressed plans to streamline immigration processes at Lahore airport by increasing counters and introducing electronic gates for passport scanning, aiming to expedite the procedures for travellers.
Additionally, steps are being taken to tackle the overbilling of electricity, with assurances from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to support the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in rectifying the issue.
Naqvi also highlighted ongoing efforts to combat human trafficking, acknowledging the need for intensified measures. He commended the Karachi and Sindh Police for their vigorous crackdown on street crimes and advocated for legislation to curb the misuse of social media platforms.
Earlier, Naqvi inaugurated the Shaheed Shahzad Younas Investigation Block, named after the late Inspector Shahzad Younas, in tribute to his service. The minister toured the newly inaugurated block along with FIA Director General Ahmad Ishaque Jehangir and other officials.
Earlier this month, revelations surfaced in The Guardian exposing that the Indian government orchestrated targeted killings in Pakistan as part of a broader strategy aimed at eliminating terrorists residing on foreign soil.
These claims were made by Indian and Pakistani intelligence operatives who disclosed details to The Guardian.
According to interviews conducted with intelligence officials from both nations and supported by documents provided by Pakistani investigators, fresh insights emerged regarding India's purported foreign intelligence operations, particularly its alleged involvement in carrying out assassinations abroad.
