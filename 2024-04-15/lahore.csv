0,Cash-strapped railways using 100 locos that have outlived their life,"35 engines were purchased 50 years back; company paying heavy cost for maintenance, fuel of old engines.","LAHORE: The Pakistan Railways — the country’s second largest state owned enterprise — has no money to replace 100 locomotives that have passed their entire operational life of 20 to 25 years and has no option but to keep running them. Of the 100 outlived engines, around 35 were purchased in 1975—around 50 years ago, Dawn has learnt.
Besides unavailability of funds, the railways is plagued by other administrative issues as well that have forced it to keep the old fleet on tracks.
“The PR is in dire need of at least 100 new locomotives to replace the old ones procured in 1975 and 1990. But the problem is the paucity of funds that must be made available to procure new locomotives and save the heavy maintenance cost being incurred on making the old ones operational,” an official source explained while talking to Dawn.
“The situation is worsening as the incidents related to faults in the outlived engines are increasing,” the official, who requested anonymity, said, urging the government to allocate sufficient funds for the railways in the upcoming annual budget for the year 2024-25 under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).

35 engines were purchased 50 years back; company paying heavy cost for maintenance, fuel
of old engines

According to the official, the Pakistan Railways has 350 active locomotives of various specifications. Besides this, it has over 60 engines that are not in operation and are currently parked at various yards. In railways terms, such engines are called as grounded and supposed to not to be used further. In 1975, the railways had purchased 35 locomotives of 300 horsepower. Some 10 or so were of 150 horsepower. Likewise, another 54 were procured in 1990, followed by some more purchased before the end of the year 2000. In 2013-14, the department purchased 63 more locomotives.
Similarly in 2017, the railways purchased 55 locomotives of 90 series (4,000 HP), having capacity to take load of 3,400 tonnes at 80km speed per hour. In 2019, another 20 engines of 45 series having capacity of 2,000 HP were also procured.
“If you see the purchasing year, we have only 138 locomotives that still have their life for 12 to 20 years or so. But the rest of all have completed their life, especially those procured in 1975 and the 1990s. Life of a new locomotive is up to 25 years maximum but the Pakistan Railways is still using the 35 to 50 years old locomotives with heavy maintenance cost,” the official said.
To a question, he added that to overcome the shortage of new locomotives, the railways needed sufficient funds to procure at least 100 new engines.
In this way, the railways can save millions of rupees being incurred on maintenance of old engines. Similarly, the cost of fuel can also be saved since the new engines in the market are fuel efficient with excellent mileage at a reasonably high speed.
GAS: The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) on Sunday severed another 62 connections and imposed Rs1.5m fine on the consumers for gas pilferage and other illegalities.

2,Social media helps woman win freedom in Toba Tek Singh 16 years after kidnap,Asia Bibi said she was very glad that her reunion was happening with her family after 16 years.,"TOBA TEK SINGH: Social media has made it possible for a woman from Kashmir to get freedom 16 years after her kidnapping.
The woman was allegedly kidnapped from Khulana locality of the Chakothi Police Station area on the Indian border in the Hattian Bala district of Azad Kashmir was recovered by the Arrouti police from village Shahpur of the Toba Tek Singh district.
Toba district police spokesperson Attaullah told the media persons on Sunday that Asia Bibi, daughter of Raja Sher Muhammad, had gone missing from her village in 2008 and Chakothi police had registered a case. Asia was actually kidnapped from her area by one Ghulam Mustafa, a resident of Jhang, who brought her to his city and kept her in his house for two years. He later handed her over to an aged man, named Allah Yar, a resident of Toba, who contracted a marriage with her. She had been living with him since then.
Asia recently found an opportunity to use a smartphone and she recorded her video in which she told her story of kidnapping that occurred in 2008. She told about her present whereabouts. She made her video viral on social media, which was watched by someone from her village and he informed her parents. The matter was brought to the notice of the federal government and finally Faisalabad Regional Police Officer Dr Muhammad Abid Khan and Toba District Police Officer Ibadat Nisar were contacted.
The Toba police spokesperson said police raided the house of Allah Yar and recovered Asia. She has been temporarily shifted to Darul Aman on the order of a judicial magistrate from where she would be handed over to the Azad Kashmir police. Allah Yar has also been arrested and police would arrest the abductor, Ghulam Mustafa, from Jhang to hand both the suspects to Azad Kashmir police.
Asia Bibi said she was very glad that her reunion was happening with her family after 16 years.

3,Punjab government slashes roti and naan rates,Association of naanbais and tandoorwalas has rejected it saying they have not been taken on board.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government on Sunday decided to cut the rate of roti and naan and implement the decision immediately.
The decision was announced by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz through her personal account on social media X (formerly twitter).
 






“Alhamdulillah, Punjab government has reduced the price of bread to Rs16 per loaf from today. I have directed all districts of Punjab and the departments concerned to ensure strict implementation of the decision. May Allah Almighty bring more ease in the lives of people,” reads her statement.
Acting upon the direction, deputy commissioner of each district, including Lahore, immediately issued a notification fixing the price of a 100 gram roti at Rs16 and of 120g naan at Rs20.
Though citizens have breathed a sigh of relief on the provincial government’s decision, the association of naan-bais/tandoorwalas has rejected it saying they have not been taken on board.

Punjab government slashes roti and naan rates

“There had been no coordination with us. The deputy commissioners issued the so-called notifications without taking us on board,” Naan-Bai Association president Aftab Gill tells Dawn.
“Perhaps, for the first time in history the stakeholders have been ignored before taking a decision on reducing prices of a commodity,” he laments, rejecting the notification.
He says that an application of his association has been pending with the DC office for the last two months seeking to increase the roti and naan prices keeping in view the rising costs of flour, gas and electricity.
Recalling that a former DC (Umer Sher) had earlier imposed such a unilateral decision in July 2022 only to be taken back when the naan-bais took out a rally up to his office, he says that they will repeat history if the authorities do not come up with a compensating formula for them.
Explaining that the government should offer them subsidy to cut the roti and naan prices instead of benefiting the consumers at the cost of the tandoorwalas, he threatens to shut down the tandoors if the government tries to forcibly impose the decision on them.
Responding to a query about likely cut in new wheat crop rates, he says that wheat flour is not the only input required to make bread. “The tariffs of gas, power and labour have also gone up adding to our production cost.”

Agriculture Secretary Iftikhar Ali Sahoo presided over a meeting about wheat management. 
He was briefed that no adverse effects were observed on wheat crop due to the recent rains. However, the rain spells have slightly delayed the grain harvesting process.
Mr Sahoo demanded wheat harvesting and threshing report on a daily basis and compilation of per acre yield record.
He said that the ongoing activities in the field for technical guidance of the farmers regarding harvesting, storage and delivery of wheat should be accelerated.
“Wheat advisory should be issued keeping in view the weather conditions.”
The secretary directed that guidance should be provided to cotton growers on advanced production technology immediately after wheat harvest in
south Punjab and monitoring should be expedited to ensure availability of quality agricultural inputs in the markets at fixed prices.
He said in view of the importance of the ongoing campaign regarding cotton cultivation, the miscellaneous duties of all the staff of the agriculture department have been terminated.
The officers and field staff of the agriculture department should improve the field activities to guide the cotton farmers. 
Coordination with the local officials of the irrigation department should also be improved regarding the supply of water for cotton cultivation.  
Special Secretary Agriculture Dr. Shehanshah Faisal Azim, Director General Crop Reporting Dr Abdul Qayyum, Consultant Dr Anjum Ali, Agricultural Information Director Naveed Asmat Kahloon and other officers participated in the meeting.

5,punjab notes: Punjab: does it mean rusticity?,Certain misconceptions gain currency and with the passage of time for the fact of being reiterated ad nauseam they...,"Certain misconceptions gain currency and with the passage of time for the fact of being reiterated ad nauseam they become common. This is usually the result of not being able to differentiate between appearance and reality which are not only two sides of the same phenomenon but are also deceptive as they overlap each other.  
Punjab suffers from a strange fallacy in contemporary times. Imagine Punjab. What does it evoke? You see it as what you find in the images and visuals thrown around you; countryside, villages, cattle and half-naked peasants. Just have a look at the sets of television programmes regarding Punjab. The sets of such programmes would have wells, painted pottery, motifs of cattle and folk stools with gaudy colours, handheld fans with tinsel frills etc. While visualising and erecting the set the set-designer goes brain dead. Some mysterious force seizes his thinking ability and compels him to look at Punjab purely in terms of an agrarian society. His entire concept of set, if one accepts it as one, is drawn from the detritus of bygone era. Flotsam and jetsam are offered as symbols that supposedly represent the reality of Punjab. The producer/director of the programme happily accepts what is offered as compatible with the current social reality of Punjab. Look at the irony of the situation; both the persons live in a metropolis or modern urban centre but when they think of Punjab they exclude all from it except countryside and the traditional life that has almost vanished. The trappings of country life imagined by them have disconnect with ground reality. Stuck in the past they fail to realise that well has been replaced by tube-well, oxen by tractors, colourful stools by plastic chairs and handheld fans by electric fans. What is being stressed here is that an irreversible change has taken place in our countryside which they fail to comprehend. They forget that the cities in Punjab have overwhelming presence as they guide and control life in the rural areas.  
Punjab, they ignore, has a very long history of urban society spanning thousands of years starting from Harappa if not from earlier period. It’s not to deny the existence of rural society. Rural and urban societies are twins joined at hip; one cannot exist without the other. The former needs the innovation and knowledge created by the latter and the latter needs the agricultural surplus produced by the former. 
Situation is somewhat similar in our literature. You can find in our literary set poets a dime a dozen. They endlessly churn out verses that mostly fall in the category of doggerel or sentimental kitsch. Like television programmers they take Punjab as it was in the past, idyllically painted by the tradition. Their voice is a voice from the past laced with a wistful feeling. It’s remembrance of the things past in a mode of nostalgia coupled with subdued lamentations full of self-pity.
What was valuable has been lost and what is present has nothing worthwhile to offer. Popular poems doing rounds these days appeal to the dead poets or saints and the spirit of an imagined Punjab to stop the wheel of time and resurrect what has been buried underneath its dust. Like others they conceive Punjab as it was, not as it is. They imagine Punjab as an infinite number of rural settlements in close proximity of nature in a state of bliss. Nothing can be more removed from reality. In their mental maps cities do not exist. If they exist at all, they exist negatively. The poets conveniently forget that rural life was marred by poverty, misery, starvation and petty conflicts. It was cities which introduced technology, methods of modern cultivation, new varieties of seeds and pesticide that improved the quality of life in countryside.  
Remember peasants have the notion of 13th month of the year, the month when harvest is not ready and they face severe financial crunch. For some months, elders would tell you, they had grass grown in their hearths in the machineless past. 
The situation is equally bad if not worse across the border in the East Punjab. They are like their counterparts this side of the border hooked on the past and obsessed with the countryside. Look at their songs and lyrical poetry to discover what they have common with the west Punjabis. Their songs incessantly wax lyrical of village life and ‘Jat’ and “Jati (a Jat woman)’. Jat has multiple meanings. It means a peasant, a rustic, an uncouth person. But it also denotes a tribe, a caste. They in the sense of a tribe were originally nomads and started landing in Punjab after 13th and 14th centuries and gradually became good and hardworking farmers.  
When they became a dominant segment of Sikh community they forgot their humble origins; the newly gained power went to their head. Now most of their artists conceive Punjab as a mammoth village dominated by a Jat, dead drunk with a gun on his shoulders, in frantic search of his ideal beloved who cannot be other than a Jati. Their singers glorify village idiocy as a mark of culture as they talk of guns and shootings in their romantic meanderings in gruff voices which lack skill and aesthetic appeal. Finesse is frowned upon as effeteness and machismo is touted as manliness. You no longer find Asa Singh Mastana, Surindar Kaur and Parkash Kaur, Wadali Brothers and Jagjit. All this happens despite the fact that every young man desperately wants to leave his village to settle in the urban centres of the advanced world. But whenever they think of Punjab it’s nothing more than rural settlement.
In the West Punjab our mind evokes Punjab as a rural entity because we are cut off from our history and culture. Above all, we have lost our language. Since we find our language and cultural practices intact to some extent in the rural areas we subconsciously equate Punjab with the countryside. Cities are no-go-area for our mother language and culture. That’s why we tend to have the image of our homeland frozen in the past.  
In the East Punjab they own the language but they associate the ethos of Punjab with agriculture and countryside as if cities don’t exist. In a nutshell, both fail to see Punjab as it is; a fast changing countryside that emulates cities, and growing cities in a globalised world that lead the countryside in a new era of modernity. — soofi01@hotmail.com

Mr Elahi, who is in jail, faces Chaudhry Musa Elahi, son of Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain, of the PML-Q.
Three sisters - Qaisara Elahi, wife of Mr Elahi, Naaz Elahi, wife of former Attock district nazim retired Maj Tahir Sadiq, and Sameera Elahi, wife of Tafweez Chohan - along with their niece (sister’s daughter) MPA Basima Riaz Chudhary from Mandi Bahauddin, visited the main bazaar of Kunjah on Sunday in connection with Mr. Elahi’s election campaign.
After completing their visit to the bazaar and meeting with traders and shopkeepers, they arrived at the residence of Sheikh Shehkaz Aslam Moon where a large number of party workers and local traders had gathered.
Qaisara Elahi delivered a hard-hitting speech against her brother Wajahat Hussain, criticising him for resorting to pressure tactics through the police and administration against the supporters of Mr. Elahi in Kunjah and other areas of the constituency.
She said that Wajahat had now taken the lead from his nephews Salik Hussain and Shafay Hussain in using these tactics, surpassing what Shujaat’s sons did in the February 8 polls.
Had her mother been alive today, she would have dealt with her brother strongly, Qaisara said, adding that this was the first time she had spoken against Wajahat.
She said she wanted to clarify that people had a misconception that Mr Elahi would leave Imran Khan after facing many difficulties. She said that Mr Elahi had proven predictions wrong by standing firm with Imran Khan and not yielding to the influence of his relatives.
Qaisara said that Mr Elahi has endured many hardships for standing with Mr Khan for a year, and she affirmed that Mr Elahi, along with her, their children, and all their family members, firmly support Mr Khan.
The PP-32 by-elections will be held on April 21 after federal minister Chaudhry Salik Hussain vacated the seat to retain NA-64 (Gujrat-Kunjah).
