0,Man accused of killing Indian spy critically injured in Lahore gun attack,"Masked men shoot Amir Tamba inside his home; IGP says claim of Indian involvement ""premature"".","LAHORE: Amir Sarfraz Tamba, the man who allegedly killed Indian prisoner Sarabjit Singh in Kot Lakhpat prison in 2013, was critically injured in an attack on Sunday, according to police officials.
Media reports claimed that the victim was killed in the attack, but Lahore SSP Operations Syed Ali Raza confirmed to Dawn that the victim was alive, but critically injured.
Tamba was at his residence in Lahore’s Islampura area when two masked armed men forcefully entered his home in Ganga Street and fired multiple shots.
They fled the scene, leaving the victim in a pool of blood. He was rushed to a local hospital, where he was being treated, according to Tamba’s younger brother, Junaid Sarfraz.

Masked men shoot Amir Tamba inside his home; IGP says claim of Indian involvement ‘premature’

In a statement given to police, he said he lived on the ground floor of the house with his family, while his brother lived in the upper portion.
Around 12:40pm, two armed men entered his house, went to the upper floor and “fired multiple shots at Amir”.
Mr Sarfraz added that upon hearing the gunshots, he rushed upstairs and found his brother in a pool of blood. The masked shooter and his accomplice, who was wearing a helmet, fled the scene.
They were riding a Honda 125cc motorbike and escaped.
Mr Sarfraz said the police were informed about the attack, and his brother was rushed to a local hospital with three bullet wounds, including two in the chest. Later, sources told Dawn police were unable to trace the victim’s whereabouts.
Tamba’s younger brother first moved him to a hospital via a private ambulance and then informed the police, sources said, adding that police had yet to make any headway in locating the ambulance as well. However, there was no official corroboration of this claim.
Alleged ‘foreign hand’
The attack has raised concerns among the government higher-ups over the alleged involvement of India.
The attack came days after UK’s Guardian reported that the Indian government assassinated individuals in Pakistan as part of a wider strategy to eliminate “terrorists” living on foreign soil. While talking to Dawn, Punjab Inspector General Dr Usman Anwar said any statement about foreign involvement in the attack would be “premature or too early” at this moment.
A high-profile investigation has been launched to determine the motive behind the attack, including the possibility of a foreign government’s involvement. Islampura police have lodged a murder case against unknown armed men on Mr Sarfraz’s complaint.
Due to the significance of the attack, the Punjab government has referred the case to the police’s Counter-Terrorism Department Punjab for investigation.
According to sources, police have been ordered to increase the number of checkpoints in the city, besides heavy deployment at all entry and exit points to trace and arrest the killers.
One of two attackers
Tamba was one of the two inmates who had attacked Singh in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat prison, where the Indian was serving a death sentence after being convicted of espionage.
He and the other accused, Mudasir Munir, were acquitted in 2018 by a district and sessions court after all witnesses retracted their statements.
Singh was killed a couple of months after Kashmiri leader Afzal Guru was hanged in Mumbai’s Tihar Jail in Feb 2013.
Guru was awarded a death sentence by an Indian court over his role in a deadly attack on parliament in 2001.
Singh was serving his death sentence awarded by the Supreme Court of Pakistan for a series of bomb attacks in Lahore and Faisalabad that killed 14 people in 1990.
The execution of his sentence was repeatedly delayed by the government.

1,"Bilawal for talks, warns against ‘sit-in politics’",PPP leader demands judicial reforms to ensure justice; Zardari urges politicians not to repeat past mistakes.,"

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and President Asif Ali Zardari address a gathering to mark the 45th death anniversary of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh, on Sunday.—Dawn

 
LARKANA: As a multi-party opposition alliance geared up its protest against the coalition government, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Sunday warn­ed against the ‘politics of sit-ins’ and advocated for reconciliation instead.
Speaking at a public gathering to mark the 45th death anniversary of PPP founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said “some people” were trying to form the ‘PNA 2.0’. He said they were playing with the fate of the country because of their egos.
He reminded these people about the history of the “nine stars” who campaigned against Zulfikar Ali Bhutto with the dream of reaching the power corridors but ended up with a decade-long dictatorship instead. It may be noted that the PNA or the Pakistan National Alliance was a multi-party movement against the PPP government formed in 1977. According to the PPP chief, political stability can only be achieved through the ‘Charter of Democracy’ and ‘Charter of Reconciliation’ and the PPP will be at the forefront.
He said the Charter of Democracy had been implemented up to 90 per cent, adding that judicial reforms under this charter were yet to be implemented.

PPP leader demands judicial reforms to ensure justice; Zardari urges politicians not to repeat past mistakes

He said the PPP aimed to achieve the reforms with the help of legal fraternity and civil society to ensure justice from courts, adding that the confidence of people in this regard had gone down. “We have to implement judicial reforms,” he said.
He also referred to his 10-point agenda that he had announced during the election campaign. The ex-foreign minister said the Sindh and Balochistan governments led by the PPP would fully implement the 10-point programme and provide relief to the people in the budget. “We are also ready to work on the federal level in this regard,” he added.
ZAB case
Talking about the reference decided by the Supreme Court regarding the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto case, the PPP leader said: “We must see why the injustice was done.”
He said unfortunately the dictator [Ziaul Haq] and the judiciary were its part. The apex court admitted that Z.A. Bhutto was not given a fair trial and the short order was “our historic success”, he added.
Speaking on the occasion, President Asif Ali Zardari invited the people to sit and think together to serve the country, stressing that power is meant to serve the masses. He said people were braving difficulties and “we must think that future generations should not suffer”.
The PPP leader admitted that the mistakes were committed in the past but asked politicians to refrain from repeating them in the future.
He invited them to sit together for talks and leave in case of any disagreement. “This is our politics and we learnt it from Benazir Bhutto,” he said. “I am happy today, as I did my duty,” he said, adding that he headed the party as per her vision.
He said he had become the president twice with the support of the people and party workers and “I make decisions with their strength”.

2,President’s address to joint session now on 18th,Zardari set to make history by addressing parliament for record seventh time.,"ISLAMABAD: Delaying his parliamentary address, President Asif Zardari has now summoned a joint sitting of both houses of parliament on April 18, as the National Assembly Secretariat on Sunday issued a six-point agenda for the sitting on Monday (today), which includes the laying of an ordinance promulgated by the caretaker government and a calling attention notice on the issue of the construction of a barrage on Ravi River by India.
“President Asif Ali Zardari has summoned the joint session of the Parliament on Thursday, April 18, 2024 at 4pm. The president has summoned the joint session of Parliament in exercise of the powers conferred by Articles 54(1) and 56(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” said an official announcement of the Presidency.
“The earlier notification to call the joint session of the parliament on April 16 stands cancelled,” it said, without giving any reason.
Sources in the NA Secretariat, however, told Dawn that the president had taken the decision on the demand of the lawmakers, mostly belonging to the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), who had expressed some reservations over calling of the joint sitting soon after the Eid holidays as they wanted to spend some more time in their home constituencies.

Zardari set to make history by addressing parliament for record seventh time

The sources said that the president had delayed the joint sitting for a couple of days on the request of the party members who met him at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh, where he had addressed a public meeting in connection with the death anniversary of the party’s founding chairman Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
Seventh address
This will be President Zardari’s record seventh address to the joint sitting of the National Assembly and Senate as during his five-year stint in the Presidency from September 2008 to 2013, he had already addressed the parliament six times. President Zardari’s sixth address on April 16, 2013, too, was a record as no other president had addressed so many joint sittings before him.
It was some abhorrence of former military ruler Pervez Musharraf for the National Assembly that gave Mr Zardari an extra sixth chance, instead of five, to address a joint sitting.
Gen Musharraf had addressed the joint sitting as president only once in 2004, in the face of strong opposition protests, and never came to the parliament again till his resignation in August 2008.
He had not called a joint sitting even after the February 2008 elections and that constitutional requirement was then fulfilled by President Zardari and since then, his predecessors Mamnoon Hussain and Dr Arif Alvi continued this practice of addressing the joint sitting at the beginning of each parliamentary year.
President Zardari is likely to face a strong protest by the members belonging to the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the party which has been protesting over the conviction and detention of former prime minister and its founding chairman Imran Khan and the alleged rigging in the Feb 8 general elections.
NA session
Meanwhile, the National Assembly Secretariat has issued a six-point agenda for the Monday’s (today’s) sitting. It includes a calling-attention notice submitted by PML-N MNA Malik Bashir Awan on the issue of the “shortage of urea fertiliser” in the country and another one by an independent Rai Hassan Nawaz Khan “regarding Indian aggression on the water rights of Pakistan through its recent completion of the Shahpur Kandi Barrage on the Ravi River.”
Besides, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will lay the Apostille Ordinance, 2024 (No. I of 2024) before the National Assembly as required by Article 89(2) of the Constitution.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar will present the Annual Report 2022 of the Election Commission of Pakistan as required under sub-section (2)of Section 16 of the Elections Act, 2017.

3,UK court denies YouTuber’s request to stay defamation proceedings,"At the trial stage, Raja will have to prove the allegations he made against the claimant.","LONDON: Retired army officer and dissident vlogger Adil Farooq Raja was denied by the UK High Court to stay proceedings in a defamation case brought against him by a former senior military officer, with the court setting a trial date for April 2025.
The defamation suit was filed against YouTuber Raja by retired Brigadier Rashid Naseer in August 2022, but was made public this week after the respondent stirred another controversy in Pakistan over his allegations targeting leading film and TV actresses.
An order issued by the court suggests that Mr Raja’s campaign against Mr Naseer kicked off on June 14, 2022 when the former alleged that he “has taken complete occupation of the Lahore High Court ‘to rig the upcoming elections’”.
The order issued last week by the High Court of Justice, King’s bench division in the media and communications list before Richard Spearman KC sitting as deputy high court judge details the allegations made by Mr Raja and determines their meaning at the preliminary stage.
It maintains that the case centres on 10 publications, which range from alleging that elections were not proceeding because the claimant (Mr Naseer) had taken complete control of the Lahore High Court; that the claimant had several meetings with Asif Ali Zardari during his stay to discuss election manipulation; that the claimant has set up an election cell in the ‘sector headquarters’ of Lahore tasked with gathering progress reports on PDM and PML-N candidates and that it is pressuring local influencers against PTI; that the claimant was abusing his position and that the claimant is directly involved in political interference.
The judge held that of the 10 allegations, nine are defamatory of the claimant at common law, and that the words complained of were said as statements of fact. At the trial stage, Mr Raja will have to prove the allegations he made against the claimant.
The order set out the administrative processes of sharing disclosure documents and witness statements, and allowed Mr Raja’s application to anonymise witnesses when exchanging witness statements.
Pakistan does not have robust defamation laws though the penal code does have some provisions pertaining to defamation cases. In recent years, however, Pakistanis defamed in the UK, either by a UK-based publisher or individual, have approached courts here to settle defamation claims.
Several high-profile individuals, including PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif and stalwart Ishaq Dar have filed defamation claims against publications here, and secured apologies when the publication declined to go to trial.
Defamation trials in the UK are costly, and can cost tens of thousands of pounds at the minimum. Many lawsuits involving Pakistanis have ended before going to trial stage, when the defendant apologises or offers to pay damages to the claimant.

4,Finance minister reaches Washington for crucial talks with IMF,"IMF ministerial meetings and events are scheduled for April 17-19, with additional activities planned from April 15-20.","WASHINGTON: Finance Minister Muh­ammad Auran­gzeb arrived in Washington on Sunday with his team to participate in the IMF and World Bank’s spring meetings and initiate talks on a new financial package ranging from $6 billion to $8 billion.
The IMF ministerial meetings and events are scheduled for April 17-19, with additional activities planned from April 15-20.
Mr Aurangzeb and his team have a packed schedule, including bilateral meetings with IMF and World Bank leaders, as well as senior officials from various international financial institutions. They will also hold discussions with finance ministers from China, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Turkiye, and other friendly nations attending the event.
Representing Pakistan at multilateral meetings, they are also expected to meet US officials, given the meetings are held in Washington.
Meanwhile, IMF Man­­a­g­ing Director Kristalina Georgieva mentioned that Pakistan still has crucial issues to resolve, acknowledging the country’s interest in a new loan arrangement.
This signifies the potential for a follow-up programme with the Fund after completing the current $3 billion stand-by arrangement later this month, as prime minister previously indicated the necessity for another deal with the IMF to stabilise Pakistan’s economy.
Earlier this month, IMF’s Director of Comm­unications Julie Kozack noted Pakistan’s interest in securing its largest loan facility yet and expressed readiness to engage in programme discussions in the coming months.
The IMF is also expected to finalise the disbursement of the last tranche of $1.1 billion from the existing arrangement during the spring meetings.
Pakistan’s Ambassador Masood Khan and officials from the Pakistan embassy welcomed the finance minister at the airport.

5,‘Meddling’ claims bring Tyrian White case back into limelight,"IHC judges say matter drew ""considerable pressure"" from intel operatives who wanted to ensure the plea was deemed ""maintainable"".","ISLAMABAD: The Tyrian White case — a petition filed against former prime minister Imran Khan for concealing his alleged daughter — seems to have become something more than a paternity matter.
This is because the case was one of the only matters specifically referenced by Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges as having invited “pressure” from intelligence operatives after a letter written by six judges to the Supreme Judicial Council became public.
“Considerable pressure was brought to bear on judges who had opined that the petition was not maintainable, by operatives of the ISI, through friends and relatives of these judges,” said the letter addressed to the SJC on March 25.
Following an abortive attempt by the government to form a one-member commission to probe the matter, the complaints of meddling in judicial affairs have now been taken up by the Supreme Court in exercise of its suo moto jurisdiction, and are now likely to be deliberated upon by a full court on April 29.

Set to be taken up again after nearly a year, IHC judges said the matter drew ‘considerable pressure’ from intel operatives who wanted to ensure the plea was deemed ‘maintainable’

Referred to in the letter as “Muhammad Sajid vs Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi (Writ Petition No. 3061 of 2022)”, this case has been on the back burner since May last year, when IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq dissolved a three-member bench hearing the case. The high court is likely to take up the matter again in the coming days, but the circumstances under which the bench was scuttled seemed quite peculiar, even at the time.
Maintainability and a ‘premature’ verdict
A three-member larger bench consisting of IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, and Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir had reserved their verdict on March 30, 2023.
During earlier hearings, Justice Kayani had questioned the locus standi (right of audience) of the petitioner, Mohammad Sajid, whereas the presiding judge Justice Farooq appeared to be convinced on this particular aspect.
It should be noted that former IHC chief justice Athar Minallah had earlier dismissed a similar petition.
During the hearing of the petition on March 2, 2023, the counsel for the petitioner argued that Imran Khan had submitted an affidavit to the Superior Court of California in a case related to the custody of Tyrian, his alleged daughter.
But the chief justice corrected him, saying that it was not an affidavit, rather a declaration that was signed by an oath commissioner in Pakistan.
At the time, Justice Kayani had pointed out that the declaration never mentioned that Mr Khan was the father of the girl, and questioned the bona fides of the petitioner, observing that only Tyrian White herself could file a petition seeking paternity rights.
Then, on May 10, the opinions of two judges were uploaded on official website of the court, only to be taken down within minutes.
The registrar office then issued a statement clarifying that “the opinion of two judges was uploaded alone with office notes, which does not constitute [a] judgement of the court”.
The statement said the “chief justice has reconstituted the bench for rehearing of the case”, and that action was “being taken against those responsible for uploading the opinion without issuance of cause list”.
Not seeing eye to eye
The letter by the six IHC judges also hinted that some judges do not see eye to eye with the incumbent chief justice of the country’s ‘youngest high court’.
The letter recounted a number of communications with the IHC chief justice, especially in the context of the Tyrian White case.
While the judges noted that the IHC CJ had told them that no official from the intelligence agencies would approach them, they complained that the interference continued despite this assurance.
It is telling that senior puisne judge Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani — the senior-most after the chief justice — is one of the authors of the letter.
On the surface, Chief Justice Farooq and Justice Kayani have a good working relationship, as both used to sit on the same division bench and have decided a number of important political cases in the past, including references against Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz and Asif Ali Zardari.
The two were also part of the original bench hearing the Tyrian White case before it was dissolved.
However, Justice Kayani was recently assailed by a complaint before the Supreme Judicial Council, which accuses him of “inducing and convincing other judges of high court” in connection with the letter.
Retired Justice Noorul Haq N. Qureshi, himself a former senior puisne judge of IHC, told Dawn that differences between the chief justice and the second senior-most judge are “a routine occurrence” in the superior judiciary. He said that the senior-most judge expects power to be shared, but some chief justices want “absolute authority”.
“I also experienced the same, but I never complained because I thought it would harm the reputation of the institution that administers justice to the public at large,” he said.

6,Noshki attack victims laid to rest in Punjab,Funeral of six men held in Mandi Bahauddin.,"GUJRAT: All nine victims of Friday’s Noshki attack were laid to rest on Sunday in their native areas in central Punjab districts.
The men, hailing from Wazi­rabad, Gujranwala and Mandi Bahauddin, were abducted from a Taftan-bound bus and shot dead by Balochistan Liberation Army gunmen. Their bodies were later dumped under a bridge in a hilly area of Noshki.
The bodies of six victims arrived in Mandi Bahauddin’s village Chak Fateh Shah on Sunday.
The officials of local administration and police received the coffins loaded on Rescue 1122 ambulances at the Salem Interchange of Lahore-Islamabad Motorway.

Funeral of six men held in Mandi Bahauddin

They were buried in a local graveyard after a joint funeral.
The lone survivor, identified as Zahid Imran Butt of Mandi Bahauddin, also reached the village along with the dead bodies.
Visibly devastated, Mr Butt didn’t talk to reporters when they tried to ask him about the attack.
A statement issued by the Mandi Bahauddin district administration said Gujranwala Commissioner Naveed Haider Sheerazi, Mandi Bahauddin Deputy Commissioner Shahid Marth, District Police Officer Raza Kazmi and other officials attended the funeral on the directions of the Punjab chief minister and chief secretary.
Talking to the heirs of the deceased, Commissioner Sheeraz offered condolences on behalf of the Punjab government and condemned the killings.
He said the government was with them in this time of grief.
The body of 17-year-old Wasiq Farooq also arrived in Chora village of Wazirabad district, where he was laid to rest in a local graveyard after funeral prayers.
While a large number of locals attended the funeral, no government official was present.
As per the family sources, all nine victims and a survivor, aged between 17 and 23 years, had valid visas for Iran and Iraq. They intended to travel to Turkiye and enter Europe from there.
The families had initially paid Rs260,000 to a Gujranwala-based agent for the travel arrangements, and the men left their hometowns on April 7. They were identified as Tanzeel Nasir, 20; Muhammad Qasim, 22; Sajid Imran, 23; Abu Bakar, 23; Muzamil Hussain, 22; Mazhar Iqbal, 21; Wasiq, 17; Rana Shahzeb; and Javed Shahzad.

9,Literary Notes: Urdu in India and issues in Urdu orthography,"IN DELHI’S Urdu Bazaar in 1980s, there were some 80 shops selling Urdu books. Now there are barely six and they ...","


 
IN DELHI’S Urdu Bazaar in 1980s, there were some 80 shops selling Urdu books. Now there are barely six and they too have to wait for a passionate customer looking for Urdu books, says a story by Srijana Siri, titled ‘Delhi’s Urdu Bazaar and the Decline of a Language’, published by The Indian Express in its April 2, 2024, issue.
Many reasons can be given for the decline of the language that was the medium of literary expression in India for all and sundry, from prince to pauper, just a couple of centuries ago. Bahadur Shah Zafar, the emperor of India, living in the Royal Fort — near the very same Urdu Bazaar — used to compose poetry in Urdu, as did hundreds of commoners and nobles in that city alone. But the sad fact is now Urdu is fighting a losing battle in India.
Among those fighting against the odds is Dr Ather Farouqui, general secretary of Delhi’s Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu Hind (ATUH). The Anjuman has been working since 1903, and its Urdu magazines and publications are considered among the authentic ones. But Farouqui’s job is becoming more difficult day by day. Aside from a host of problems, one issue is how to retain the ever-decreasing readership for Urdu books and magazines. The number of readers is dwindling and the attitude of the Indian government towards Urdu is, at best, indifferent, if not hostile.
Apparently, the Urdu academies established in Indian states receive funding from the government to promote Urdu and several Indian universities do have Urdu departments where Urdu is taught at the highest level, but since Urdu is generally not taught at the school or college level, the younger generations are not interested in Urdu. But Farouqui is determined and fighting it out.
Urdu Adab, a magazine that the ATUH began publishing in 1921 under the editorship of none other than Moulvi Abdul Haq, the colossus, set an example for Urdu research journals. Ever since Farouqui took over as secretary and editor in 2012, Urdu Adab often takes up burning questions and does not hesitate from criticising what it perceives to be detrimental to Urdu.
Theme of Urdu Adab’s latest issue, July 2023-March 2024, also available online at atuh.org, is Urdu imla, or Urdu orthography. The quest for standardised and unified orthographic rules to write Urdu is on since long and it only picked up pace with the publication of Rasheed Hasan Khan’s epoch-making book Urdu Imla in 1974. Ghalib and later on Debi Prahshad Sahar Badayuni discussed some aspects of Urdu orthography in the latter half of 19th century, but it was Ahsan Marehravi who deliberated some issues in Urdu orthography through his magazine Faseeh-ul-Mulk. In 1920s, Hashmi Fareedabadi and Abdus Sattar Siddiqi formulated some rules at the ATUH under the aegis of Abdul Haq, who was very keen to resolve the issue.
In Pakistan, Urdu Dictionary Board adopted some rules under Shanul Haq Haqqee’s guidance to compile Urdu’s most comprehensive Urdu-Urdu dictionary when he was heading the organisation. Ghulam Mustafa Khan and Farman Fatehpuri were the two stalwarts who took up the issue and tried to give some guiding principles. In India, Rasheed Hasan Khan’s book became the most referred guide on Urdu orthography, though many still don’t agree with some of Rasheed Sahib’s suggestions.
In fact it was the ATUH that took Urdu orthography seriously some 100 years ago and Urdu Adab’s latest issue, dubbed Imla Number, endeavours to capture the essence of the debate that has been raging for over a century. Farouqui’s editorial, crisp and candid as ever, sums up some issues and he, in his usual style, does not mince words to point out some lacunas that are hurting Urdu in India most and, as he puts it, one of the elements that are detrimental to Urdu in India today, is the induction of madressah students into Urdu departments of Indian universities. These students are admitted to BA classes and, albeit being quit well-versed with Urdu, Persian and Arabic, they have little or no study and understanding of literature. But almost all of them aspire to become a professor at a university, playing havoc with Urdu language, literature and their teaching, says Farouqui.
The latest issue also includes a list of some 300 words as sample standardised Urdu orthography. Though in Pakistan some may not agree with the way some words are spelt out in the sample, it is a commendable effort to address the issues in Urdu orthography. The recommendations of a seminar held at Islamabad’s National Language Promotion Department in 2022 have also been made a part of the issue, making it an open forum for all kinds of opinions and one feels that such all-embracing approach will help resolve issues of orthography that Urdu has been grappling with for over one-and-a-half century.
