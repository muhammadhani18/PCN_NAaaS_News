1,Missed opportunities,"Washington wants Islamabad — Rawalpindi, to be exact — not to improve its relations with countries like Russia or Iran."," 


Late in December 2023, the United States Treasury warned that it would apply sanctions on foreign banks for evading the Russian price cap and called on them to boost compliance.
Playing it safe, banks in China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) that work with Russia increased checks. They have now begun asking for extra documentation and have trained more staff to make sure deals were compliant with the price caps, Reuters reported, quoting eight sources familiar with the matter. Russian oil firms are consequently facing delays of up to several months or even rejection of money transfers into their accounts in Moscow.
Cautious of US secondary sanctions, these banks are now asking clients to provide written guarantees that no person or entity from the US Special Designated Nationals (SDN) list is a payment beneficiary or involved in a deal.
Recent Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil hubs and refineries have also increased pressure on the Russian oil industry. Rosstat, Russia’s Federal State Statistics Service, said that in the week ending on March 24, the nation’s production of motor petrol fell by approximately 7.4 per cent to 754,600 tonnes compared to the week prior, when production was at 815,300 tonnes, as reported by Newsweek.

Pakistan is holding off on benefitting from Russian oil price caps, unlike other Asian countries, due to supposed pressure from the US

To manage any surge in domestic fuel prices, Russia banned gasoline exports for six months on March 1, meaning lost revenues for the Kremlin. Moreover, the tightening sanctions on Russia’s oil exports are raising freight costs for moving Russian crude, Tsvetana Paraskova reported on Oilprice.com.
Recent estimates by Argus Media say that since the US warned of using secondary sanctions against vessels striving to bypass American sanctions regime in December, shipping Russian crude from a port in the Baltic Sea to China costs around $14.5 per barrel. Reports say that more than half of this per-barrel cost is attributable to the sanctions.
 
 

With the increase in pressure, Russian exports to India are also under the cloud. India’s imports of Russian crude oil fell to a one-year low in January — down 35pc from last year’s peak — as New Delhi appeared to diversify its crude sources.
After the announcement by the US Treasury and State to blacklist Russian state tank operator Sovcomflot, all Indian refiners are reportedly refusing to take Russian crude transported on vessels of Sovcomflot and avoid running afoul of the stricter enforcement of the US sanctions on Russia, Oilprice.com added. Russian crude exports on Sovcomflot’s fleet to India have dropped by 0.3m barrels per day (bpd) from the 2023 average, the report added.
Indian refiners are now carefully checking the ownership chain of every tanker carrying Russian crude to ensure the vessels are not affiliated with Sovcomflot, or other entities on the US sanctions list, unnamed sources with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg mid-March.
Most cargoes, previously bound for India, are now either discharging or heading to private refiners in China, the world’s top crude importer.
Yet, the overall scenario is not bleak for Moscow. It has leverage, too. Despite all the above, Asian imports of Russian crude oil hit a 10-month high in March, Reuters said, quoting a London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) Oil Research report.
Higher arrivals of Russian crude in March to the top-importing markets in Asia are set to boost Asian crude imports to 27.5m barrels per day (bpd) — the highest level in 10 months. The estimated import volumes in March are higher than Asia’s 26.7m bpd imports in February and the 27.2m bpd arrivals in January this year, the LSEG report said.
China remains the top buyer, with its crude imports from Russia approaching 11.8m bpd in March, up from 11.2m bpd in February and 10.4m bpd in January, the data added.
The sanctions could spike oil market prices. While Moscow would benefit from higher market prices, the Biden Administration may not find them palatable — especially in an election year.
While Washington wants the sanction regime to work, it is also striving to dissuade Kyiv from targeting Russian oil installations behind the scenes, as it may result in a price spike. Russia knows this well and has begun flexing its oil market muscle accordingly.
Russia has asked its oil companies to reduce output and ensure compliance with its reduced Organisation of Oil Producing Countries (Opec) output quota.
Moscow’s decision to cut oil production is likely to push the price of oil to $100 a barrel later this year, warned J.P. Morgan Global Commodities Research in a recent note, unless countermeasures are taken by the US or other suppliers — not an easy task. Given the shaky market balance, it seems the US is keeping the dark, ‘shadow fleet’ of Russian tankers taking its crude to customers on a rather loose leash.
 
 

This presents Pakistan with an interesting opportunity. Regretfully, under pressure from important quarters, Islamabad does not seem to be paying much attention to emerging opportunities. When the then prime minister Imran Khan visited Moscow in 2022, just when the Russian ‘war on Ukraine’ began, there were discussions about Pakistan importing crude from Russia at a discounted price.
Immediately after, the PTI government was toppled, and it seemed that the opportunity to import crude at a discounted price from Russia was gone. However, after a lull, the new Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government under Shahbaz Sharif also moved ahead with the project.
Former minister of state for petroleum, Dr Musadik Malik, was vocal about the possibility at the time.
A few containers of Russian crude were even imported, with some saying it was the advent of a new era.
Since then, the project seems to have fizzled out. Why? Not much is known. Some feel the power brokers in Rawalpindi do not want to annoy Washington, hence the lull. Similarly, there has been no progress on the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline — again due to US pressure, some assert. Both these projects could have helped Pakistan overcome its energy scarcity problem at an affordable cost.
The US pressure, though, is not understandable. On one end, Washington wants Islamabad — Rawalpindi, to be exact — not to improve its relations with countries like Russia or Iran to at least ease its energy conundrum. On the other, it is allowing India to continue nurturing ‘crude’ relations with Russia.
 
 

The contrast is visible. US Treasury Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Eric Van Nostrand said early this month that the United States neither expects India to reduce its oil imports from Russia nor has requested New Delhi to do so.
The Indian Express reported that Mr Nostrand said at an event organised by the Ananta Centre in New Delhi, “The price cap’s goals are to limit Putin’s revenue and maintain global oil supply, essentially by creating a mechanism for India and other global consumers of oil, to access Russian oil at discounted prices.” He added that emerging markets like India benefited from the price cap as Russia was forced to deepen discounts on its oil.
Tightening screws on Moscow provided Pakistan with an opportunity. Why shouldn’t we avail it? That is a big if, and someone in the corridors of power needs to have a straight, heart-to-heart talk on the issue — if one can.

2,The next round of inflation,Reverting back to a long-term inflation target of 5-7pc will remain challenging.,"The inflation print for March clocked in at 20.7 per cent year-on-year, the lowest level in two years. However, it still remains considerably elevated over the long-term average. Over the last two years, inflation above 20pc on a year-on-year basis has led to significant demand destruction, as real incomes and purchasing power continue to decline.
However, despite demand destruction at a household level, the government’s insatiable appetite for plugging its fiscal deficits through more debt continues to fuel more inflation.
The government’s inability to initiate reforms that rationalise expenditures, as well as the inability to expand the tax net to increase tax revenues at a pace faster than inflation, continues to keep the fiscal deficit elevated. An elevated fiscal deficit eventually translates into higher inflation, as more money is printed to buy fewer goods available in the economy.
The destruction of demand has been real. The Large Scale Manufacturing index remains lower than its peak of March 2022, implying that over the last two years, manufacturing has remained well below earlier peaks and even below optimal levels. An increase in electricity prices continues to contract per capita electricity consumption as industries increasingly move off the grid while households are severely constrained by their budgets.

The chatter of a reduction in interest rates should not be heeded till the time the US Federal Reserve also starts easing rates

The CreditBook MSME Index essentially tracks the daily transactions of more than 30,000 Micro and Small Enterprises. A review of transactional data during the month of Ramazan suggests that there has been a drop in real spending (adjusted for inflation) by around 2pc.
 
 

This includes the impact of any shopping that takes place for Eid festivities. A lack of economic activity has translated into sub-par growth, expected to remain less than 1.5pc for the year, much lower than the expected population growth rate.
On a forward-looking basis, the country is still not out of the woods. There has been an upsurge in commodity prices globally, with the price of crude oil increasing by 12pc over the last one month. Similarly, the price of palm oil has increased by 8pc during the last one month as well.
An upswing in international commodity prices generally has a contractionary impact on Pakistan’s economy, given its high dependence on imports of crude oil and palm oil and perpetually constrained foreign currency reserves. Any sustained increase in commodity prices over the next few months can potentially trigger another round of inflation, leading to another spiral of price increases.
 
 

The only way to snap out of such a conundrum is through undertaking structural reforms in the economy, that either reduces consumption of oil in the economy through a massive roll-out of public transport, or through accelerating export earnings. The absence of a will to undertake such reforms would ensure that the country remains exposed to bouts of inflation driven by supply-side pressures, followed by knee-jerk reactions that subsidise demand when prices increase, further fueling more inflation.
A storm is brewing, and our policymakers remain aloof. Over the last year, the rupee has continued to appreciate against the dollar, making our exports less competitive and imports relatively cheaper. An obsession for maintaining an overvalued currency has wreaked havoc on the economy for over two decades.
The same mistakes are being repeated as the currency is gradually allowed to move to an overvalued state. Since March 2023, the rupee has appreciated more than 15pc, as measured through the Real Effective Exchange Rate.
An overvalued currency will remain susceptible to external shocks, particularly in a scenario where commodity prices are increasing. Any surge in price-driven growth of imports would lead to greater demand for foreign currency, resulting in the rupee’s depreciation, which may lead to another round of inflation.
Another factor that may compound problems and lead to the depreciation of the rupee, triggering another round of inflation, is the repayment of foreign currency debt due during the next few quarters. It is estimated that more than $1.6 billion of foreign currency debt needs to be repaid for debt taken up by power plants established during the last seven years.
Additionally, $1bn of repayment must be made on the maturity of the Eurobond, while other bilateral debt must either be repaid or rolled over. Impending foreign currency requirements to settle debt will continue to exert pressure on foreign currency reserves, making it increasingly difficult to maintain an arbitrarily overvalued exchange rate.
In such a scenario, the near-term risks to inflation remain high. A sustained surge in commodity prices can lead to a series of events that can fuel another round of inflation. Households continue to struggle with contraction in real incomes and purchasing power. Another round of inflation will further squeeze any limited purchasing power while unravelling any stabilisation measures that may have been put in place.
The chatter of a reduction in interest rates should not be heeded till the time the US Federal Reserve also starts easing rates. Any premature reduction in rates will have an inadvertent effect on the value of rupee, which is already on shaky grounds.
A forward-looking approach needs to be taken to brace for the impact of any sustained increase in commodity prices, whether through targeted cash transfers or product substitution. All efforts must be made to avoid rolling out blanket subsidies, as has been time and again over the last many decades.
Reverting back to a long-term inflation target of 5 to 7pc will remain challenging in the absence of fiscal discipline at the sovereign level. Until such discipline is attained, the country will continue to struggle with double-digit inflation while being exposed to the cyclicality of commodity price shocks.

3,Global venture capital heads down a rocky recovery road,Venture capital funding recovers by 14.2pc compared to Q4FY23 while the actual number of deals drops by 36.9pc.,"For the better part of the last 15 years, Pakistan has faced serious economic troubles. Even during the supposedly good times, the alarm bells were quite clear.
Lately, we have truly learned the meaning of rock bottom through a series of ‘firsts’. Be it the highest inflation in our history, interest payments exceeding federal revenues or another indicator of your choice.
Briefly, the startup ecosystem appeared to be immune from the entire mess — at least to the flag bearers — as capital was pouring in regardless. Once that stopped, everyone became an expert on monetary economics and asset allocation.
Nevertheless, rounds were still being announced, albeit far less frequently. However, we have found a new rock bottom: in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, Pakistani startups raised a grand sum of zero dollars. It goes without saying that this was the lowest total in over five years, at minimum, possibly even 10.
Of course, announcements don’t necessarily mean no dollars came in, but based on anecdotal evidence from within the small ecosystem, the lack of funding avenues is becoming a little too clear. Its effects are already showing in the uptake of startup shutdowns. While we are hitting rock bottom, there are early signs of the global venture market recovering.

Venture capital funding recovers by 14.2pc compared to Q4FY23 while the actual number of deals drops by 36.9pc

According to the latest data from Pitchbook, global venture capital (VC) funding reached $95.7 billion across 7,520 deals in Q1FY24. While the amount is flat compared to the same period of 2023, it’s an improvement compared to the seven straight quarters of sequential decline.
There was a recovery of 14.2 per cent compared to Q4FY23. Volumes-wise, there was less to cheer for as total deals plunged 36.9pc to 7,520 — the lowest figure since Q3FY16. Even if you add the estimated undisclosed transactions, which take the number to 10,222, it’d still be the worst since Q3FY20.
While the headline figures may be comforting, a deeper look suggests there is still a way to go before recovery as the biggest drivers of deal value continue to struggle. In VC, North America and Asia account for the largest share of investments — more than three-fourths historically. Therefore, in order to truly bounce back, these two need to be standing on their feet.
So far, this hasn’t happened. North America has only once managed to avert a decline in Q4FY23, when the deal value edged up 1.1pc year-on-year but was down again 30pc to $37.3bn. On the other hand, Asia has had nine straight quarters of sequential decline now.
In fact, its funding value of $18.5bn was the worst since Q2FY17. While both Latin America and Europe experienced some respite, only the latter’s numbers were meaningful enough to have an impact on the global totals.
Things were a lot worse by a number of deals, as North America’s 29.5pc decline was the lowest for any region while Latin America plunged 55.4pc sequentially in Q1FY24. Since Q3FY22, there hasn’t been a single quarter in which even one region saw an increase in deal count. More importantly, the reason why venture may still take time to recover lies elsewhere.
As an asset class, VC is centred around exit events — the big bumper initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions. This is how general partners multiply their stakes, earn actual cash instead of paper markup, and distribute earnings back to investors.
For now, such liquidity events are rare — at least ones that could offer a return on the valuations VC originally came in at. In Q1FY24, the exit value of VC was just $30.7bn globally. This is the lowest figure since Q2FY15 and not even 10pc of the peak of $397.1bn in Q4FY21. Similarly, the number of exits remains muted at 559, having fallen sequentially for nine straight quarters.
Asia was particularly hit hard, with exit value receding to just $9.9bn, whereas North America bounced back yearly and quarterly, albeit off a terribly low base. Meanwhile, Europe hasn’t crossed double digits in seven quarters in yet another instance of its secular stagnation.
In theory, what happens in the world of global VC should have an impact on Pakistan’s own trajectory, considering that it’s the only asset class still somewhat available for entrepreneurial finance. And it may have an impact, at least to the extent that local investors can close their subsequent funds and keep the market steady.
But anything beyond that will ultimately be driven by headline numbers and flashy stories — where we have a lot of damage control to do.

4,Boosting services exports under works,"Faced with an alarming trade deficit of $1.9bn, the govt aims to increase ICT exports from $2.6bn to $15bn in five years.","Do you know that Singapore earned $291 billion through services exports in 2022?
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Turkiye followed with their earnings of $155bn and $90bn, respectively, according to a World Bank report. Pakistan can learn a lot from these three nations and from China and India — the two Asian giants. Combined, the five countries boast an 18 per cent share in global services exports.
We all know that Singapore has one of the best education systems, and Singapore and the UAE are the preferred destinations for top professionals and top companies worldwide. Meanwhile, China, India and Turkiye have made remarkable progress in education and skill enhancement since the beginning of this century.
 
 

If Pakistan also wants to boost its services exports, it will have to follow the same course — invest more in education and skill enhancement and become an acceptable destination for foreign investment in the services sector. However, even before that, the menace of extremism and terrorism will have to be eradicated.
The present hybrid regime has started working on the second part of the agenda, and understandably so. The framing of the budget for the next fiscal year, starting in July, will show evidence of whether or not it is also seriously working on the first part of the agenda.

Faced with an alarming trade deficit of $1.9bn, the govt aims to increase ICT exports from $2.6bn to $15bn in five years

It wouldn’t be easy to do in the current tough economic environment. Nevertheless, it needs to be done at once. There is no other way.
Merchandise exports may take time to grow enough in volume to significantly impact the trade deficit because of the ongoing energy price hikes and the resultant increase in the costs of all inputs. This is too difficult to contain in a single year. Faster chances of dramatic growth lie in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector.
During the first eight months of this fiscal year (July 2023-Feb 2024), services exports fetched $5.1bn, and services imports consumed $7bn. The trade deficit, thus, came to $1.9bn.
Such a large deficit is unsustainable, particularly at a time when Pakistan is experiencing one of the worst forex crises of its history. In the last full fiscal year, our services exports and imports stood at $7.6bn and $8.6bn, respectively, and the trade deficit was much smaller, $968 million.
Containing this deficit is doable only via massive growth in the export of services, particularly in the ICT segment and not through containing imports of services since that can hurt not only the economy but also the growth of the services sector and services exports.

The central bank needs to push financial institutions harder towards venture capital and find innovative ways to support viable technology startups

ICT services are the largest segment of our overall services exports. It roughly accounts for 40pc of the total export proceeds of all services. The caretaker government had devised a plan to boost ICT exports from $2.6bn in the last fiscal year to $15bn in five years.
Generally known as information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITeS), the growth potential of this segment of services is enormous. We have a youth bulge in our demography — tens of thousands of young men and women can fluently speak English, and many of them are keenly interested in IT and ITeS and willing to work online during odd hours.
The current government should not allow the hard work of the caretaker government to go to waste and must ensure that workable parts of that plan are implemented sooner rather than later.
However, that same plan, or a modified version of it, may only work if all stakeholders are taken on board before and during its implementation and bureaucratic hindrances are not allowed to spoil it.
 
 

Towards the end of March, the civil-military-run Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) finally approved a plan to construct Pakistan’s largest IT park in the G-10 area of Islamabad.
This IT hub, planned to be spread over 3.3 acres of land, would work under a public-private partnership and facilitate an estimated 6000 freelancers, according to media reports — a good idea. But what about the previous grand IT parks that were planned to be set up in Karachi?
Have they started working? How are they benefiting from our IT exports, and what facilitating role is the federal or provincial government playing in their progress and performance?
There were two key elements of the ICT growth strategy of the caretaker government: First, to open more opportunities for girls and women in digital companies and online work platforms, and second, to encourage greater collaboration between large firms and small and medium enterprises.
If sincere efforts are made to achieve these two strategic shifts in our IT and ITeS export strategies, the results could be surprisingly grand. However, both the federal and provincial governments need to work in close coordination and ensure the participation of the right stakeholders in the implementation programmes. Can we expect that? It is possible, but given the track record of both our political parties, it seems a bit too difficult.
Shortage of funds has long impeded the growth of technology startups, and they either look for foreign funding or close shop if initial funding dries up while local banks look the other way. This must come to a stop now.
The central bank needs to push banks harder towards venture capital and find some innovative ways to finance viable technology startups. Similarly, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Pakistan Software Houses Association should sit together to find out how best to tax IT and ITeS companies. Indeed, some potentially good small companies leave the business early allegedly due to harassment by FBR staff.

5,Red-tape stalls Karachi’s K-IV project,The K-IV project gets pushed back another year as the Sindh govt struggles to appoint a project director to meet Ecnec conditions.,"The Kalri Baghar (KB) Feeder Upper lining project — an important component of the Karachi Greater Bulk Water Supply Scheme (K-IV) project — is yet to start its development after being approved in July 2023 by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec).
The K-IV project itself is facing delays and is now slated for completion in 2025, contrary to the previous deadline of October of this year. Likewise, for the time being, the KB Feeder lining project appears to be in limbo, and the cost escalation of the project cannot be ruled out.
 
 

A perennial canal, the KB Feeder, supplies water to Keenjhar Lake after taking off from the right of Kotri Barrage. The lake is a vital drinking water source for the provincial capital. The lining of the 38km long canal is to be done at a cost of close to Rs40 billion on a fifty-fifty cost-sharing basis by the federal and Sindh governments. Meanwhile, the K-IV is being executed by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) at a cost of Rs126bn.
Administrative approval for the lining project was issued in September 2023 by the federal government, requiring the Sindh irrigation department to submit a work plan “to complete the project in sync with completion of the K-IV”.

The K-IV project gets pushed back another year as the Sindh government struggles to appoint a project director to meet Ecnec conditions, among other issues

The Sindh Irrigation Department has submitted its work plan. Funds shall be released by the federal water resources ministry accordingly. In case of delayed implementation of the canal’s lining, the Sindh government shall ensure the provision of water for the K-IV for the interim period.
The most important aspect of administrative approval is that the federal government mentioned that “any increase in cost [in the KB Feeder lining project] will be borne by the Sindh government”, which refers to the cost escalation as the federal government would be under no obligation to share it. Since July 2023, the Sindh government has been unable to finalise the tendering process for the project director (PD) appointment, which has been an issue for quite some time.
In the caretaker Sindh government, the post of PD was held by the then Chief Engineer (CE) of Kotri Barrage, Haji Khan Jamali. He had been issued an embarrassing show-cause notice on the day of his retirement relating to the project’s tendering process by the then irrigation secretary, Dr Niaz Abbasi.
Dr Abbasi had cancelled national competitive bidding by the irrigation department, as he believed the process was marred by anomalies, and called for holding international competitive bidding (ICB) instead.
Mukhtiar Abro replaced Mr Jamali as acting director until a full-fledged PD was appointed through a competitive process. A steering committee, headed by the chairman of the Planning & Development Board of Sindh, was formed to hire the PD, while the ICB was scheduled for March 20.

About Rs6n and Rs3bn, respectively, have been released by the federal and Sindh governments for the lining project, which may be completed for Rs40bn by 2027

The ICB was adjourned twice, first on April 5 and now on April 19. In the meantime, Mr Abro was replaced by CE Kotri Barrage, Mir Ghulam Ali Talpur, as PD on March 29 despite Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah’s already placed summary on March 14 recommending the appointment of Zahid Junejo (a former Sindh member of Indus River System Authority) as PD of the lining project.
 
 

Other competitors besides Mr Junejo were Yasin Qureshi, Mr Jamali, and senior CE Shafqat Wadhu. Mr Jamali has since moved the issue to the Sindh High Court, pleading that Zahid Junejo has attained the age of superannuation — thus, he (Jamali) now qualifies to become PD. The matter is pending adjudication.
Sindh Chief Miniter Murad Shah reviewed progress on the K-IV and the lining project on April 6. He pressed for timely completion of the K-IV, saying he would request the federal government to release Rs30bn to Rs40bn allocated for the K-IV under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
Secretary Irrigation Zarif Khero informed the chief minister that Rs6n and Rs3bn, respectively, have been released by the federal and Sindh governments for the lining project, which will be completed for Rs40bn by 2027.
Official sources stated that the chief minister believed that a separate PD should not be hired for the project as this would save several millions of rupees of government. CM Shah said that CE Kotri Barrage may be notified as PD under the post because he has to ensure the water supply to the downstream population depends on the KB feeder during the execution of the lining.
Moreover, the chief minister wants the completion of the lining project in two years instead of three years.
One officer says CM Shah intends to discuss the matter with irrigation minister Jam Khan Shoro. If the two agree, the Planning Commission would be requested to allow the Sindh government to drop the idea of hiring a director from the market.
“If PD is not hired from the market, then it will help us [Sindh government] save around Rs600m considering the fact when a PD is hired several officers are to be engaged besides provision of required paraphernalia,” says another officer. However, he says that there is a condition of Ecnec that a PD needs to be hired from the market if a project’s cost exceeds Rs600m. Let’s see what happens,“ he adds.
With a burgeoning population, Karachi’s water needs are increasing rapidly. Karachi also regularly gets an influx of people from other parts of the country. According to irrigation officers, the lining of KB Feeder Upper is supposed to conserve 500 cusecs of water, which would be utilised for the K-IV in phase-I through the same canal. In phase II, the K-IV is supposed to get another 700 cusecs of water.
This volume of water is to be made available by conserving water by lining two other off-taking canals of Kotri barrage, namely Phulelli and Pinyari [both left bank canals].
The provision of 2,400 cusecs of water was agreed upon by the federal government at the time of the Water Apportionment Accord 1991, the document that forms the basis for interprovincial water distribution. Sindh is providing 1,200 cusecs of water to Karachi through KB Feeder — 680 cusecs over and above 520 cusecs as the provincial share of Sindh for the metropolitan city under the 1991 accord.
Karachi needs 2,400 cusecs of water. Sindh has been relentlessly arguing with the federal government that such a quantum of water should be made available for the metropolis out of the ‘national pool’. This matter remains pending in the Council of Common Interests.

10,Eid spirits rise — better late than never,Retailers make up for low profits in the first three weeks of Ramazan as shopper footfall picks up in the last week just before Eid.,"Unwilling to forego the joy of Eid despite the tough economic situation, Pakistanis flocked to the markets to maximise their budgets closer to Eid.
This surge in shopping activity in the last week of Ramazan contrasted sharply with the slower pace observed in regular markets and malls in the first three weeks of the holy month.
Keeping challenges emanating from the lagging economy in sight, some companies innovated by making necessary adjustments, streamlining their online operations and strategically timing their discounts and sales offers based on thorough market analytics. This approach resulted in significant returns for some. Yet, trend watchers suggest that losers likely outnumbered gainers in the formal sector.
“Good performance was not consistent across all brands. Forward-thinking enterprises, mindful of their customer base’s affordability and reduced profit margins, set realistic goals and executed their carefully crafted market strategies.
 
 

“While companies in the retail sector are often reluctant to share real-time sales data and inventory information, my observation is that even in cases where sales volumes fell below expectations, revenue targets were met due to higher price points,” shared an executive from a major apparel company in a private conversation.

Retailers make up for low profits in the first three weeks of Ramazan as shopper footfall picks up in the last week just before Eid

Background research conducted through interviews with leaders of market associations and marketing experts revealed that the success rate among medium and micro enterprises dealing in apparel and other Eid-related items was notably higher than that of larger brands in the formal sector.
“It is essentially a matter of affordability rather than choice. In some cases where a branded item is accessible, customers may perceive it as overpriced and might not be willing to pay the premium.
“While everyone appreciates quality, most people prefer to stay within their budget and are hesitant to feel cheated by paying more than what they deem a fair price,” noted a market observer.
Families have primarily focused on purchasing personal items and grooming products and services, while home improvements and the acquisition of consumer durables, including big-ticket electronics, have generally been very limited this year.
 
 

Local producers gained significant ground, a trend that emerged since the shock of the 2020 pandemic, even in segments previously dominated by imports, such as children’s wear.
Commenting on the depressed share of imported items in Pakistani markets, Badaruddin Kakar, a business leader from Balochistan, argued that heightened vigilance by customs and other border control authorities to curb the influx of goods from China, Iran and India has limited their availability and increased their cost, often beyond the reach of the average household. This has created more space for local suppliers and has been advantageous for their producers.
Eid discount bazaars outperformed typical regular markets in major cities across Pakistan. However, in second-tier cities like Multan, Faisalabad, Gujrat, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Khairpur, and others, regular markets fared just as well, if not better than temporary Eid sales stalls.
In contrast to major cities, second-tier towns in the country witnessed higher consumer participation in the Eid market. “Compared to their counterparts, town dwellers exhibited more enthusiasm, according to early indicators,” an analyst shared.
“The cost of living for households in these towns is relatively lower than those in cities like Karachi and Lahore, where nuclear families are prevalent. In town settings, people often opt for joint family arrangements to save on utility and other living costs, allowing them to allocate more funds for special occasions like Eid,” explained a marketing research professional.
The footwear sector, though a fraction of the apparel sector in size, with multiple new brands and unbranded companies launched over the last year, did exceptionally well this year.
“There was something more at work here than a superior marketing strategy. Probably people deferred buying shoes till Eid instead of buying new shoes for children at the start of the academic session,” an analyst invented reasoning.
“Most brand representatives I interacted with during my visits to malls, markets and dedicated brand stores in Lahore were content. They appeared to be fairly relieved a day before Eid. After a dull start and lean business in the first three weeks, they pinned their hopes on the last week, and shopaholic Pakistanis didn’t disappoint them. The footfall increased to a level typical for the Eid season in Pakistan,” another retail expert informed.
“Generally speaking, home-based dress and accessory makers, small footwear manufacturers, certain brands in the sector, street beauty parlours and hairdressers, among others, topped the list of gainers.
“Meanwhile, tailoring, large apparel stores, consumer durable companies and furniture makers suffered losses, alongside numerous others in the 2024 Eid market,” he added.

11,Is the World Trade Organisation era ending?,The US and EU have started breaching WTO rules to suppress Chinese competition via discriminatory national policies.,"Is the era of so-called ‘unfettered free trade’ and multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) regime coming to an end?
These challenges mostly come from developed countries trying to bend the rules to undermine competition or hamper the working of important organs, like dispute and settlement systems, to protect their business interests. Now, these powers seem to be drifting further away even from the principles of free trade and have started adopting protectionist policies, breaching the WTO regime, in the name of a green transition to protect the climate.
In recent years, the United States (US) has more often than not enacted policies to suppress competition in the name of national security, protect jobs and industry, and disrupt global supply chains. The US Congress, for instance, has passed the American Innovation and Competition Act, which offers $52 billion to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and $200bn for scientific and innovative research and development.
In 2022, Congress enacted the Chips and Science Act. Later that year, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was passed. The enactment of the contentious IRA, a multi-billion-dollar subsidy programme for the country’s auto industry struggling to cope with looming competition from China’s cheaper electric vehicles (EV), is being seen as a fresh threat to the multilateral trading order.
The law explicitly excludes investors from benefiting from the subsidies for every new energy vehicle produced if they include so-called foreign entities of concern (FEOCs) in their supply chains, which clearly breaches the WTO rules.

The US and EU have started breaching WTO rules to suppress Chinese competition via discriminatory national policies

The IRA stipulates that the new energy vehicle tax credits save consumers $7,500 per unit. Still, an eligible clean vehicle must not contain any battery components manufactured or assembled by the FEOCs, companies or entities listed by the US. Thus, American car buyers are ineligible for subsidised EVs if certain components were produced by Chinese, Russian, North Korean or Iranian manufacturers.
 
 

China, which became the world’s largest electric car exporter last year and is believed to be the main target of this subsidy programme, has filed a complaint with the WTO to initiate consultation over the IRA.
China argues that the Act unfairly discriminates against cars that use Chinese battery components. “This move is not only to protect the interests of Chinese EV companies and promote a fair, competitive environment for the global EV industry but also to firmly uphold the rule-based multilateral trading system,” a Chinese official said after filing the complaint.
Beijing says the IRA has a serious negative impact on the stability of the global industry supply chain and the environment for fair competition, and its filing against the US at the WTO echoes the international community’s concerns.
However, wrapping up her China visit last Monday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says said a flood of below-cost Chinese steel into the global market over a decade ago “decimated industries across the world and in the United States”. She affirmed that Washington “will not accept” a situation where underpriced Chinese goods flood the global market again, battering industries elsewhere, adding that the US allies and partners share similar concerns.
Even though the IRA is a China-specific action, its impact is also being felt elsewhere. Initially, South Korea had considered resorting to the WTO against the IRA. The European Union (EU), Canada, New Zealand and other WTO members have also criticised the IRA.
 
 

In a letter sent to the US Treasury by the European Commission in November 2022, it argued, “If implemented in its current form, the Act risks causing not only economic damage to both the US and its closest trading partners, resulting in inefficiencies and market distortions but could also trigger a harmful global subsidy race to the bottom on key technologies and inputs for the green transition.”
Nevertheless, the earlier dissatisfaction of these countries has softened due to their shared fear of China’s growing dominance in new energy industries, including EVs, solar energy, etc. Also, threats of trade challenges have prompted the US to negotiate Critical Minerals Agreements with select countries to give them access to EV tax credits in the IRA. The EU seems to be joining the US in its crusade against the Chinese EVs.
A recent EU-US Trade and Technology Council meeting condemned the ‘threat’ posed by “third country use of non-market economic policies and practices”, an obvious reference to China’s state subsidies that the West says are causing a global glut of solar panels, EVs, and many other manufactured products. It also agreed to non-economic countermeasures to such (Chinese) policies, including export controls and investment screening, to ‘boost’ the EU and the US economic security.
Indeed, Beijing has engaged in discriminatory policy for several years, preventing non-Chinese companies from supplying EV batteries to Chinese car manufacturers, a European analyst wrote. The countermeasures the US and the EU have pledged to implement are like denouncing China’s non-market policies while supporting the same measures domestically.
On the face of it, the actions taken by the US to protect its auto industry are a breach of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures of WTO, which is why demand for WTO rule reforms is being voiced by American groups. The Chinese challenge to the IRA at WTO has prompted calls for a Climate Peace Clause to “stop WTO attacks on policies needed to fight climate change”.
Legally speaking, China does have a point — the IRA does violate WTO rules — and stands to win its case. But will the Chinese lawsuit succeed in preserving multilateralism as envisaged at the WTO’s inception? That seems highly improbable.

12,CORPORATE WINDOW: Pakistan’s labour productivity dilemma,Pakistan’s low average growth rate of 1.5pc from 2010 to 2020 reflects increasing economic unproductivity.," 


As per the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition, labour production represents the total volume of output produced per unit of labour during a given time. Economists refer to labour productivity as the amount of output per worker. It is calculated by dividing GDP by the total number of working labourers.
Labour productivity is one of the most important indicators of economic growth and is linked with living standards. It determines economic growth and affects everyone in the economy. Higher labour productivity reflects high business profits, wages for workers, and more government revenue.
Unfortunately, Pakistan has been running low on productivity for the last two decades — though it was once ahead of peer countries like India, Bangladesh, and China for at least one decade. According to the ILO, Pakistan had an average labour productivity rate of 1.5 per cent from 2000 to 2020 annually, compared to India’s 5.7pc, Bangladesh’s 3.9pc, and China’s 8.5 pc in the same period.
It’s a sad state of affairs that one of the founding members of the Asian Productivity Organisation (APO) was surpassed by India and Bangladesh in the years 2008 and 2012 respectively.

Pakistan’s low average growth rate of 1.5pc from 2010 to 2020 reflects the country’s increasing economic unproductivity due to political instability, insignificant exports, and lack of R&D

Labour productivity is either a one-factor or partial-factor measure of productivity and doesn’t reflect overall production efficiency. For example, low labour productivity could reflect labour production efficiency but not the production method depending either on usage and cost of human labour or technology — as only labour productivity can make it difficult to determine which is the case.
Therefore, economists often analyse Total Factor Productivity (TFP) — the GDP per unit of combined input — to determine the overall production efficiency of a country. It reflects how efficiently an economy capitalises its production factors to produce output. It is a key determinant for long-run output growth.
A research report published in January 2023 by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, ’Sectoral Total Factor Productivity in Pakistan,’ reflects that TFP is crucial for sustainable economic growth.
Countries with high TFP growth experience faster and more long-term economic growth compared to countries with low TFP growth. Evidence shows that economies with TFP growth above 3pc achieve GDP growth rates of 8pc and above, while those with below 3pc TFP growth have GDP growth between 3pc to 7pc. This indicates a positive correlation between TFP and GDP growth.
However, Pakistan’s average growth rate across 61 sectors from 2010 to 2020 remained low at 1.5pc, reflecting the increasing unproductivity of the economy over time. The study categorises sectors based on TFP growth, with services and tech-based sectors showing high growth, while manufacturing sectors, including key export sectors like sports goods and textiles, show medium to low TFP growth.
The possible reasons behind the high growth in the services and tech sectors could be digitisation and greater competition, in contrast to family-owned manufacturing sectors. The sectors with negative growth are also in the manufacturing sector, including textile spinning, weaving, and leather products.
The analysis indicates a trend in which sectors receiving subsidies tend to have lower and negative TFP growth, which suddenly declines during the general election period, indicating a correlation with political instability.
Pakistan’s export sector does not have a presence among the top global export sectors. In comparison, sectors with high TFP growth are not part of major export contributors. The top two global export sectors consist of tech-based goods, including electronic products, with a global share of 16pc, and machinery & mechanic products, with a share of 12pc, which both require research and development (R&D) and innovation.
In comparison, Pakistan’s top export sector — textile — has only a 2pc global export market share. Pakistan also exports agriculture-based products, whereas the top fifteen global exports do not feature such products.
The study suggests several factors that contribute to low productivity: inadequate skilled labour, political instability, weak organisational measures, poor management practices and patronage policies, low-capacity utilisation, slow tech adaptation, and lack of R&D and innovation.
Therefore, Pakistan needs to revisit its policies and consider fostering steps to improve productivity to achieve sustainable growth. It requires immediate structural reforms and a policy overhaul focusing on human development, capacity building, transparency, and digitisation. It is time to reconsider and diversify exports and prioritise R&D and innovation in all production sectors.

13,Bumper crop and smart policies,"Pakistan’s strong harvest, along with strategic support from Ministry of Commerce, has led to record rice exports.","Rice is Pakistan’s only major cash crop that does not have a minimum support price (MSP) for growers or an energy subsidy for rice exporters. India, however, has a strong MSP mechanism. The Indian government purchases
paddy and milled rice to support growers and offers heavy direct subsidies on inputs. Recently, India announced Rs240 billion for fertilisers. Thus, India’s exports are heavily subsidised.
Despite the August 2023 restrictions, India is still the largest rice exporter and enjoys over a 27 per cent share of global rice exports. India has devised its food diplomacy to strengthen diplomatic ties, imposed an export ban on wheat, sugar, rice, and onion, and pushed sky-high prices of these commodities globally, endangering the world’s food security.
 
 

Pakistan’s rice exports could not cross the mark of $2.5bn in the last decade, but during the first eight months of fiscal year 2024, they reached a peak of $2.5bn compared to $1.1bn in 8MFY23 and $2.1bn in FY23.
Overwhelming growth in value and quantity has rung alarm bells in the competitor’s house. India sensed that their Basmati exports would fall, and apprehensions were raised in Pakistan that prices may rise, making basmati rice beyond consumers’ reach.

Pakistan’s strong harvest, along with strategic support from the Ministry of Commerce, has led to record rice exports

However, this year, domestic prices of basmati rice are falling: the price of super basmati has fallen by Rs4,000 per 40kgs to Rs8,000 per 40kgs.
 
 

It is incorrect to link rice export growth with rupee devaluation, as the dollar-rupee parity last year remained at almost Rs280.
Another opinion is that India’s export ban on white rice and 20pc export tax on parboiled rice has terrified global demand pressure, exacerbating prices globally, and bears little weight.
The main factors behind rice export growth are the record bumper crop in Pakistan, harvested 9.5 million metric tonnes (MMT), and the upward revision of Minimum Export Prices (MEPs), which boosted foreign exchange earnings.
We must appreciate the Ministry of Commerce (MoC) and its strategy devised at the start of harvest — implementing upward MEPs on Sep 2023 — to counter the aftermath of India’s ban on white rice exports. Upward revision enabled the country to fetch the true value of the crops, increase foreign reserves, curb under-invoicing, and keep local Basmati rice prices stable.
The Agro Products Wing was monitored closely and revised again on Nov 7, 2023, to align with the global rice market. MEPs are still below the prevailing market prices, and if the MoC revises them to match the market, Pakistan can fetch more earnings and ensure domestic prices remain affordable.
Due to warmer and drier weather because of an early El Nino in the Far East and a short-harvest rice crop, Pakistan shipped a large quantity of rice to Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia. Besides, significant achievements in non-traditional markets were added with the help of MoC.
Due to collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Commerce, the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) and the Commercial section in Russia, rice exports resumed, and the DPP approved more exporters.
Pakistan exported 3.9MMT of rice — 0.5MMT Basmati of $1,142 per ton and 3.5MMT Non-Basmati of $572 per tonne during the 8MFY24.
In FY22, rice grown on 3.5m hectares produced 9.3MMT rice in Pakistan, averaging 27 maunds per acre. Hybrid rice is rapidly growing in Pakistan due to a higher yield of 80 to 100 maunds, which is good and bad news.
This is good for non-basmati growing zones and bad for basmati growing areas, where growers are tempted to get higher yields. Two rice crops resulted in coarse rice exports increasing, but Pakistan is losing the global Basmati market share where once Pakistan was ruling.
To increase rice exports, we need to develop more open-pollinated Basmati aromatic extra long grain varieties and revive world-famous Kernel Basmati rice. We also need to grow and increase hybrid coarse rice in Basmati zones.
Hypothetically, 100 maund paddy productions can process 34.8MMT of rice at 60pc recovery, and for 25pc broken, 20.9MMT is available for export. Assuming $590 per tonne (free on board), the price can fetch over $12bn.
Transportation of 20MMT rice to ports is another costly head. We need to use cargo trains to reduce inland freight costs and increase exports. Our exporters always pray for a miracle of a pandemic, devaluation, export bans, or export taxes by competitors.
Afghanistan and Iran’s rice exports are misdeclared as non-basmati and under-invoiced. A major chunk of rice exported to Iran by road is not declared in customs or paltry reported. The MoC and Federal Board of Revenue must check this menace and apply the same MEPs via land and sea.
So, if we think beyond emotions purely to increase rice export earnings, it might be doable. A lot of rethinking and meticulous planning is needed, and dumping many earlier notions might be required.

14,The quest for adversarial collaboration,Pakistan is in dire need of unified efforts of disagreeing parties along with international cooperation to catalyse national transformational change.,"While pursuing structural reforms to remove macroeconomic imbalances, the federal government is simultaneously trying to step up the pace of economic growth critical for improving the economy’s fundamentals on a durable basis.
The overriding challenge in sluggish economic growth and development — along with rising inequality and poverty — is the all-pervasive, confrontationist and divisive politics that have been created.
“Foreign and local investors are afraid of investing in Pakistan because of political instability,” Punjab Chief Minister Mariam Nawaz said on April 6. On the same day, former prime minister Imran Khan told newsmen he was willing to meet anyone since the country was passing through a difficult phase. “Some PTI leaders,” he added, “are still in contact with the establishment”.
In the international arena, the negative global economic trends triggered by international geopolitics indicate that the world will remain in a low growth trap. “How much growth we can get is definitely less than in the past,” says Dani Rodrik, an economist whose research revolves around globalisation, economic growth and development, and political economics.
Changes in supply chains, trade, and tech have upset export-led growth models, inducing poor nations to search for new ways to gain wealth, wrote Patricia Cohen of The New York Times in a recent news analysis. It may be noted here that the US and China have agreed to hold “intensive exchanges on balanced growth in joint efforts to stabilise rocky ties between the two economies.”

Pakistan is in dire need of unified efforts of disagreeing parties along with international cooperation to catalyse national transformational change

“We have a much clear understanding of our common interests to forge a new era of cooperation at the global scale,” wrote Jaffrey D. Sachs in the chapter ‘Guiding Globalisation in the Twenty-First Century’ in his book The Ages of Globalisation: Geography, Technology and Institutions.
He elaborated, “Our common fate means a global society strengthened by distinctive cultures in a world made safe for diversity. Interdependence obliges us to think of one world with a common plan — for dealing with environmental and social problems which cannot be resolved by unilateral actions on the part of individual countries.”
To discover the correction course, there is also a strong view that ‘adversarial collaboration’ should embrace all kinds of organisations. Indeed, one may add, views challenging the outdated ideas hindering future progress are often unjustifiably suppressed.
Nobel Prize winner, the late Daniel Kahneman, insisted on the value of working together with those we disagreed. That is especially true in the midst of political campaigns, he argued, when the whole point is to win.
Within organisations of all kinds — including corporations, non-profits, think tanks and government organisations — the eminent scholar believed sustained efforts should be made to lower the volume by isolating points of disagreement and specifying tests to establish what is right.
Harvard professor Cass R. Sunstein, who authored Noise along with Mr Kahnerman and Oliver Sibony, wrote in the Times, “The idea of adversarial collaboration has never been more important.”

‘It is time to let every institution work within its constitutional mandate — let each do his own work’

Asking how a disagreement might actually be resolved tends to turn enemies, who are focused on winning and losing, into teammates who are focused on truth.
Amidst disagreements, a Pakistani consultant (who does not want to be identified) who advises a firm on how to improve its operations says the two sides partially succeeded in evolving a common approach, resulting in an increase in productivity.
On a macro level in Pakistan, the Business Recorder re-emphasised the need for “greater dialogue among all stakeholders, including the country’s establishment, without any loss of time” in an editorial titled ‘Quest for Higher Economic Growth.’
In search of political stability, defence and security, analyst Shahzad Chaudhry says, “It is time to let every institution work within its constitutional mandate. People should be the final arbitrator to determine if they (politicians) fail. It is time to trust their collective wisdom. Let each do his own work.”
To quote Mr Sachs, “It is best to provide public goods at the most local level of governance feasible.” He points out that local governance enables more local participation by the people directly affected, paying local attention to local conditions.
While human capital is recognised as a critical factor for enhancing productivity and economic growth, Pakistan has become the poorest-income country with a low human development rating of 164, according to Samuel Rizk, the Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Pakistan. He sees inequality expanding.
The UNDP’s Human Development Index measures three aspects of human development: a long and healthy life, access to education and a reasonable standard of living.
Pakistan is facing a growing human development crisis, with most indicators of literacy, education, health and other aspects of human welfare deteriorating in recent years, says Dr Asad Sayeed, Senior Research Associate at Collective for Social Science Research.
There is a growing realisation that international cooperation, free from hegemonic pursuit, is required to rapidly adopt of the latest technologies and innovative ideas to serve as a catalyst for transformational change.

15,Data points,"Not long ago, the rich world was braced for a costly battle with inflation. Today it can seem as if the war has been won","Self-fulfilling expectations
Not long ago, the rich world was braced for a costly battle with inflation. Today it can seem as if the war has been won bloodlessly. In most rich countries, annual core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has fallen from peaks of 5-8pc to a more tolerable 3-5pc. Growth varies from booming (America) to respectable (Australia, Canada, Japan) to tepid (Britain, the Euro area), but nowhere has it collapsed. In contrast to the disinflation of the 1980s, unemployment has stayed low. However, before the Covid-19 pandemic, the rich world enjoyed decades without any serious inflation problems. After ruthless monetary tightening in the 1980s, followed by a movement towards independent central banks targeting inflation, price surges seemed as outdated as shoulder pads. As firms and workers came to assume that inflation would stay low, they kept prices and wages in check. Their expectations thereby proved self-fulfilling.

Billionaire youths 
All of the world’s billionaires younger than 30 inherited their wealth, research has found. It signals the first wave of “the great wealth transfer”, in which more than 1,000 wealthy people are expected to pass on more than $5.2tr to their heirs over the next two decades. There are already more billionaires than ever before (2,781), and the number is expected to soar in the coming years as an elderly generation of super-rich people prepare to give their fortunes to their children. The research by Forbes magazine found there were 15 billionaires aged 30 or under but that none had created their own wealth, instead benefitting from huge inheritances. Among them are the three children of Leonardo Del Vecchio, the founder of the luxury sunglasses company Luxottica. The world’s youngest billionaire is Livia Voigt, 19, who has a $1.1bn fortune thanks to a 3.1pc stake in WEG Industries, a Brazilian electrical equipment producer co-founded by her grandfather.

Five leadership lessons
Here are five leadership lessons you probably forgot you learned in school and can start using now to get ahead at work: 1) Negotiation is an opportunity. In your current role, there are likely opportunities to negotiate all around you, for example, better pay and benefits. 2) Collaboration makes the world go round. You need to find smart ways to share your workload with others. 3) Always befriend the new kid. In college, you likely learned that cliques will limit you. 4) Don’t bite off more than you can chew. While your financial situation or ambition may have pushed you to overextend yourself in school, remember that things are likely a little different now. 5) Practical experience eats theory for lunch. In your career, especially for people who are interested in becoming leaders, it’s important to find opportunities to demonstrate your tactical abilities and your expertise.

AI disrupts Hollywood
In the good old days,” mused DreamWorks co-founder and former Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg late last year, “it took 500 artists five years to make a world-class animated movie. I don’t think it will take 10 per cent of that three years out from now.” With Hollywood already replacing staff with generative AI tools, people working the industry want rules to govern the new technology and to make sure it does not use images they have created without compensating them. The US film, television and animation industry employs some 550,000 people, and the sector’s extensive use of technology makes staff particularly vulnerable to changes wrought by AI. A study published in January, commissioned by labour groups representing animators, cartoonists and other Hollywood artists, found 75pc of industry bosses had eliminated, reduced or consolidated jobs after introducing AI into their workplaces.
