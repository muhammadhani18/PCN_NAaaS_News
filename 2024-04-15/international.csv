0,Germany’s Scholz walks tightrope on trade and politics in China,"Germany remains committed to doing business with Beijing and rejects US-led calls for ""decoupling"".","BEIJING: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in China on Sunday, kicking off a trip in which he faces a tough balancing act as he aims to shore up economic ties with Berlin’s biggest trading partner.
Scholz touched down in the southwestern megacity of Chongqing on Sun­day morning, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said, accompanied by a large delegation of ministers and business executives.
As Western allies are cranking up pressure on Beijing, Scholz is expected to underline that Germany remains committed to doing business with the world’s second-largest eco­no­my and rejects US-led calls for “decoupling”.
His friendly overtures towards China risk sparking ire among Washington and EU partners, which have been pushing back against Beijing’s heavy subsidies for industries.

Germany remains committed to doing business with Beijing and rejects US-led calls for ‘decoupling’

“China remains a really important economic partner,” Scholz told journalists on Friday, adding that he would try to level the playing field for German companies in China.
On the geopolitical front, Scholz will also use his visit to persuade Chinese President Xi Jinping to exert his influence to rein in his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and help bring an end to the war in Ukraine. “Given the close relations between China and Russia, Beijing has the possibility to exert its influence on Russia,” said a German government source in Berlin.
The three-day tour through Chongqing, Shanghai and Beijing is Scholz’s second trip to China since he took office. His first in November 2022 took place under intense scrutiny, as it came swiftly after Xi strengthened his grip on power, and marked the first post-pandemic visit by a G7 leader to China.
Stung then by painful supply chain disruptions during the health crisis as well as by China’s refusal to distance itself from Russia despite Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Western allies had been scrambling to reduce their reliance on Beijing.
‘Position of strength’
Scholz’s visit comes as many of Germany’s Western allies confront China on a range of trade issues. A slew of probes into state aid for Chinese solar panels, electric cars and wind turbines are ongoing in Brussels.
The United States is meanwhile investigating national security risks posed by Chinese technology in cars. With tensions rumbling over Taiwan, US President Joe Biden this week made defence pledges to Japan and the Philippines, while describing behaviour by Beijing in the South China Sea as “dangerous and aggressive”.
Two days before his visit, Scholz held talks with France’s President Emmanuel Macron, whose office said the leaders “coordinated to defend a rebalancing of European-Chinese trade relations”.
But China is a vital market for Germany, where many jobs depend directly on demand from the Asian giant. Both economies also badly need a boost.
The German economy shrank by 0.3 per cent last year, battered by inflation, high interest rates and cooling exports, and for this year, the economy ministry expects just an anaemic growth of 0.2pc.

1,Trump fans brave chill to hear Republican ‘martyr’ speak before trial,"Former president says he’s ""been indicted more than Al Capone, the great gangster"".","

Schnecksville (Pennsylvania, US): Former president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally, on Saturday.—AFP

 
SCHNECKSVILLE: Donald Trump’s mounting legal woes are just more reason to stick behind the former president, his ardent supporters said on Saturday, just days before the Republican leader’s historic criminal trial gets underway in New York.
Gathered in the small Pennsyl­vania town of Schnecksville, his impassioned backers said they believe Trump will come out of the proceedings stronger than ever. The crowd, braving a chilly wind and some light rain, started gathering to hear the former president speak at night as he campaign once again for the White House.
“I’ve been indicted more than Al Capone, the great gangster,” Trump said to the cheering audience. “There is absolutely nothing here. There is no misdemeanor, there is no felony, there’s no federal crime,” he claimed.
On Monday, Trump will appear in court in New York City to face accusations of falsifying business records in a scheme to cover up an alleged sexual encounter with porn star Stormy Daniels so as not to doom his 2016 election. To his fans, who huddled under fluttering American flags and “Trump 2024” banners, Trump’s proclamations of innocence rang true.

Former president says ‘he’s been indicted more than Al Capone, the great gangster’

“They are crucifying Donald Trump. He’s being turned into a martyr. And the Democrats think they’re winning. All they’re doing is making us really, really angry,” says Edward Young, a 64-year-old from Point Pleasant, New Jersey.
Young, an actor who also works in finance, said that he once was a centrist casting ballots on the merits of each candidate. But the barrage of legal cases against Trump has changed everything for him. Whether Trump is convicted won’t make any difference to Randy Thomas, 57, who also drove from New Jersey to attend the rally.
“It’s a bunch of hate from the Democrats. they’re scared of him,” Thomas said. Thomas says he’ll take to the streets if Trump is sentenced to prison. “But it ain’t gonna happen, it’s not gonna happen.” Pennsylvania is a key swing state that Trump won in 2016 but lost to Joe Biden in 2020.
‘Corrupt justice’
Another supporter, who gave his name only as Ted, came to the rally with his daughter, the first time they had been to a Trump event. “It’s important to show support to him, but also to show that the justice system is corrupt and we see it and we’re not going to let anyone fool us about it,” says Ted, a corporate executive.
Hours before the rally, Trump used similar language on his Truth Social platform, attacking the judge who will oversee his trial in New York as “totally conflicted and corrupt.” Trump’s other criminal cases — centered on his alleged hoarding of top-secret documents in Florida after he left the White House and his involvement in attempts to overturn the 2020 election — all face multiple delays.
Thomas, repeating a message Trump consistently voices online and at his rallies, said the legal troubles arise from politics — and his enemies’ desire to keep him away from the White House.

2,Russian region predicts ‘very difficult’ flood situation,Kazakh President said it was the country’s worst natural disaster for the last 80 years.,"MOSCOW: Floodwaters in southern Russia on Sunday threatened to submerge thousand more homes in the Kurgan region, where the governor predicted a “very difficult situation” in the coming hours.
There is widespread flooding in the Russian Urals regions and neighbouring Kazakhstan, caused by melting ice swelling rivers, exacerbated by heavy rainfall.
In Kazakhstan, more than 107,000 people have been evacuated from their homes, while in Russia almost 40,000 homes have been flooded, TASS state news agency reported.
Spring flooding is a regular occurrence but this year it is much more severe than usual. Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said earlier this month that this was the country’s worst natural disaster for the last 80 years.
The floods have already submerged 34,000 homes in Russia’s southern Orenburg region, due to the rising Ural River.
Journalists on Saturday saw residents being evacuated in boats and police vehicles in the regional capital Orenburg. The situation is now worsening in the Kurgan region further east.
There, the level of the River Tobol was rising fast and Governor Vadim Shumkov said “a very complex situation with rising water is forecast for tonight”. Fresh rainfall was making the situation worse, Shumkov said, and the Tobol had just risen 25 cm (10 inches) in two hours. But some were refusing to evacuate, he complained.
The Russian emergency services ministry has predicted that more than 18,000 people could get flooded out in the Kurgan region, state news agency RIA Novosti reported.

3,"19 killed, two missing after Indonesia landslide","Tana Toraja and its surrounding areas have been “continuously hit by heavy rainfall"" over past week.","JAKARTA: At least 19 people have been found dead and two more are missing after a landslide in central Indonesia, local authorities said on Sunday.
The dead and two survivors were evacuated from two landslide-hit villages in Tana Toraja regency, South Sulawesi province on Saturday evening, said local disaster agency head Sulaiman Malia.
“There have been 19 fatalities, with 4 deaths in South Makale and 15 others in Makale villages,” Malia said on Sunday.
“Currently, we are still searching for other victims,” he said, adding that there are still two individuals reported missing, presumably buried under the landslide debris. Tana Toraja and its surrounding areas have been “continuously hit by heavy rainfall, especially over the past week, with hardly any stop”, Malia added.
The heavy rainfall eroded the soil of residential areas located on mountain slopes, leading to landslides that buried residents’ homes, he said.
Indonesia is prone to landslides during the rainy season and the problem has been aggravated in some places by deforestation, with prolonged torrential rain causing flooding in some areas of the archipelago nation.

4,Unpopular Sunak in ‘doom loop’ as UK PM stares at election defeat,Surveys overwhelmingly show that Britons want an end to 14 years of Tory rule.,"LONDON: He’s failed to meet key pledges, hit an opinion poll low, and even cramped the style of a popular Adidas shoe: Britain’s beleaguered Conservative leader Rishi Sunak appears destined to lose a looming general election.
Two tax cuts and a slightly improving economy have failed to boost Sunak’s political fortunes, while criticism from ex-prime minister Boris Johnson and speculation over Brexit figurehead Nigel Farage’s intentions are adding to his woes.
Political scientist Rob Ford reckoned Sunak has been left looking “hapless” in the face of seemingly unstoppable political momentum away from his ruling Tories. “When the herd moves, it moves. There’s not much you can do,” he said.
Sunak, 43, has yet to announce the date of the election. He is expected to call it for October or November but is legally allowed to wait until January at the latest.
 
 

Surveys overwhelmingly show that Britons want an end to 14 years of Tory rule, and nothing that Sunak has done since he became PM 18 months ago appears to be changing their minds.
A YouGov poll released this month found that the Conservatives would win just 155 seats in the UK parliament, down from the 365 that they won under Johnson at the last election in December 2019. Keir Starmer’s opposition Labour Party would win 403 seats, the same survey found, leading to a whopping 154-seat majority.
“Right now, it’s very difficult to see how the Conservatives remain in government after the next election simply because of the scale of shift they need,” said Keiran Pedley, director of politics at polling firm Ipsos.
‘Moving the dial’
Sunak succeeded Liz Truss in October 2022 after Tory MPs forced her out following a disastrous 49 days in office, during which her mini-budget spooked financial markets, sank the pound and sent mortgage payments skywards.
She had followed Johnson, who himself had been defenestrated by colleagues following a series of scandals, including over illegal parties in Downing Street during Covid-19 lockdowns.
While the turmoil of the two previous administrations has hamstrung Sunak, political analysts say he has also contributed to his own plight by falling short on promises and failing to connect with voters.
Despite promising to, he has not stopped migrants arriving from France on small boats. National Health Service waiting lists are higher than when he took office. Economic growth is stagnant, although inflation has more than halved.
Sunak has also tried a number of leadership and policy resets that have fallen flat, including watering down carbon net zero commitments in a pitch to motorists and recently talking about extremism.
The rightward tilt comes as the fringe Reform UK party threatens to deprive the Conservatives of key seats, particularly if Farage stands for them as he has teased.
“(Sunak has) been trying to find this magic wand or silver bullet to turn things around but at the moment none of it seems to be moving the dial,” Pedley said.
An Ipsos poll published in March found that 58 per cent of voters view the Conser­vatives unfavourably, the highest percentage this parliament. Only 19pc view them favourably. The survey gave Sunak a net favourability rating of minus 38, the lowest of any politician included.

FOUMBAN: To enter the Museum of the Bamoun Kings in western Cameroon, you have to pass under the fangs of a gigantic two-headed snake — the highlight of an imposing coat of arms of one of the oldest kingdoms in sub-Saharan Africa.
Thousands of Cameroonians gathered in the royal palace square in Foumban on Saturday to celebrate the opening of the Museum of the Bamoun Kings.
Sultan King Mouhammad Nabil Mforifoum Mbombo Njoya welcomed 2,000 guests to the opening of the museum located in Foumban — the historic capital of the Bamoun Kings.
The royal family, descendants of a monarchy that dates back six centuries, attended the event dressed in traditional ceremonial attire with colourful boubous and matching fezes.
Griot narrators in multicoloured boubous played drums and long traditional flutes while palace riflemen fired shots to punctuate the arrival of distinguished guests which included ministers and diplomats. Then, princes and princesses from the Bamoun chieftaincies performed the ritual Ndjah dance in yellow robes and animal masks.
For Cameroon, such a museum dedicated to the history of a kingdom is “unique in its scope”, Armand Kpoumie Nchare, author of a book about the Bamoun kingdom, said. “This is one of the rare kingdoms to have managed to exist and remain authentic, despite the presence of missionaries, merchants and colonial administrators,” he said.

6,"Contain the conflict before it escalates, says US media",WASHINGTON: Analysts and policymakers in the US capital are still grappling with the aftermath of the Iranian drone...,"WASHINGTON: Analysts and policymakers in the US capital are still grappling with the aftermath of the Iranian drone attacks on Israel, as the US media on Sunday urged all sides to contain the conflict without further escalation.
The New York Times noted that Iranian leaders were already signaling “their retaliation against Israel was over” and they were “not seeking to start a wider war.”
It also noted the Iranian warning that they “could launch a bigger military operation depending on Israel’s response.”
The Washington Post also highlighted the Iranian commander’s warning but reported that Netanyahu was facing tremendous pressure from its right-wing allies in the government to launch a retaliatory attack on Iran.
CNN and another media outlet, Axios, went a step further and reported that US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday that the United States will not participate in any Israeli counterattack against Iran.
The report claims that Netanyahu told Biden he understood the US position but did not specify if the Israeli Premier agreed not to escalate tensions.
CNN also conducted an interview with former Trump advisor John Bolton, who called Iran’s ability to launch hundreds of drones and missiles into Israel a “massive failure of Israeli and American deterrence.”
As a foreign policy hawk, Bolton also urged Israel to capitalise on the current geopolitical tension to target and dismantle Iran’s nuclear capabilities, a suggestion not endorsed by any serving US official.
However, his suggestion contradicted the prevailing views in the US media that Israel attacked an Iranian diplomatic post in Syria, Iran retaliated with drones, and the situation should conclude here, without further escalation.
The New York Times also published a statement by Republican Senator Marco Rubio, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stating that the goal of Iran’s attack was to make Israel an “unlivable place” and trigger its collapse “from within, economically and socially.”
He added: “What do you think the tourism numbers are today in Israel and in the next couple of weeks? What do we think the business numbers are going to look like?”
Both The Times and The Post, along with a dozen other outlets, noted that Jordan also brought down Iranian projectiles flying over its space unto Israel.
“An unexpected — and for some, unwelcome — actor played a role in Israel’s defense: Jordan, the Arab kingdom next door,” The New York Times noted. Some outlets claimed that Saudi Arabia also intercepted some Iranian projectiles.
The Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, shared its scholars’ views with the media, with a warning that “the Middle East is on the precipice of a regional war no one seems to want.”
Jonathan Panikoff, the director of the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, says that Israel may attack Iranian targets but “in a manner that will be specific and contained and won’t lead to another significant Iranian response.”
He adds: “What’s clear is that this is the beginning of a new era, one in which Iran is willing to respond directly to Israeli attacks and in doing so risk retaliation against the Iranian homeland.” Daniel E. Moulton, a former US National Security Council staffer, warns that “the inevitable response cycle will include the United States and will likely spread across the region.”
In the piece he wrote for the Atlantic Council, he identifies the lack of transparency as the second biggest unresolved issue, noting that Israeli leaders did not notify the United States of their early April strike on the Iranian diplomatic facility.

• UN concerned over ‘very real danger’ of a devastating region-wide escalation
• EU calls upon Iran to ‘immediately cease’ attacks
PARIS: Countries around the world condemned Iran’s strikes on Israel, warning the attack could further destabilise the Middle East. Here are some of the main reactions:
United Nations
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned “the serious escalation”. “I am deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation,” he added, calling on parties to “avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East”.
European Union
President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen called on Iran to “immediately cease” attacks, saying in a message on X, formerly Twitter, that “all actors must now refrain from further escalation and work to restore stability in the region”.
Foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc “condemns in the strongest terms” the attack, calling it “an unprecedented escalation and a threat to regional security.”
G7
The G7 group expressed its “full solidarity and support to Israel and its people and reaffirm our commitment towards its security”, the group said in a statement following video talks.
“We demand that Iran and its proxies cease their attacks, and we stand ready to take further measures now and in response to further destabilising initiatives”, it said.
Nato
Nato spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said the military alliance condemned Iran’s attack and is “monitoring developments closely”, warning it is “vital that the conflict in the Middle East does not spiral out of control”.
China
Beijing also urged restraint, calling the attack “the latest spillover of the Gaza conflict” and calling for the implementation of a recent UN Security Council resolution demanding a ceasefire.
“China calls on the international community, especially countries with influence, to play a constructive role for the peace and stability of the region,” it added.
United States
US President Joe Biden promised “ironclad” support for Israel after holding an urgent meeting with top security officials.
“Our commitment to Israel’s security against threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad,” Biden said on X, posting a picture of the meeting in the White House Situation Room.
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” later that “we don’t want to see this escalate”. “We’re not looking for a wider war with Iran”, he said.
Britain
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak condemned the “reckless” strikes, which he said “risk inflaming tensions and destabilising the region”. He called for “calm heads to prevail” and added Britain will “be working with our allies to de-escalate the situation”.
Canada
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa “unequivocally condemns Iran’s airborne attacks”, adding: “We stand with Israel.”
Egypt
Cairo expressed “deep concern” at the escalation of hostilities and called for “maximum restraint”. The foreign ministry also warned of the “risk of the regional expansion of the conflict”, and added Egypt would be “in direct contact with all parties to the conflict to try and contain the situation”.
France
French President Emmanuel Macron said on X: “I condemn in the strongest terms the unprecedented attack launched by Iran against Israel, which carries the risk of destabilising the region”.
Germany
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the Iranian attack as “irresponsible and unjustifiable”, his spokesman said. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the attack took the region to the “edge of a precipice”.
Indonesia
Indonesia’s foreign ministry said it was “deeply concerned” and called on the UN Security Council “to act immediately to de-escalate tensions and continue working towards lasting peace in the Middle East, including by ending the illegal occupation of Palestine and various violations of international law by Israel”.
Iraq
Iraq’s President Abdel Latif Rashid called for a “reduction of tensions”, warned against the “spread of conflict” and emphasised “the need to stop the aggression against the Gaza Strip and to find a solution to the Palestinian question, given this is a fundamental element to the stability of the region”.
Qatar
Qatar expressed “deep concern” following the strikes and called on “all parties to halt escalation” and “exercise maximum restraint”. The gas-rich emirate, which has been engaged in weeks of talks with Israel and Hamas, urged the international community to “take urgent action to defuse the tension and de-escalate.”
Russia
Moscow expressed “extreme concern over the latest dangerous escalation in the region” and urged all sides to “show restraint”.
“We are counting on the regional states to solve the existing problems with political and diplomatic means,” the foreign ministry said.
Saudi Arabia
The Saudi foreign ministry called on “all parties to exercise utmost restraint and spare the region and its peoples from the dangers of war”.
It urged the UN Security Council “to assume its responsibility towards maintaining international peace and security”.
South Africa
Pretoria, which has brought a lawsuit against Israel at the top UN court over its offensive against Hamas in Gaza, said it was “gravely concerned” over possible escalation of hostilities in the region.
“South Africa has continuously stressed that irrespective of whether states believe that their use of force is lawful, it is never wise to resort to war as inevitably, it is ordinary people who bear the brunt of conflict”, its foreign ministry said in a statement.
Spain
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called for restraint, saying Madrid “will always condemn all forms of violence which threaten the security and the well-being of innocent civilians.”
Turkiye
Turkiye’s foreign ministry called on all sides to refrain from further escalation. “Israel’s attack against the Iranian embassy in Damascus, contrary to international law, provoked our concern. The Iranian reprisal... showed yet again that events can quickly transform into a regional war”, it said in a statement.

Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon reopened their airspaces on Sunday after closing them late on Saturday.
Israel reopened its airspace as of 7:30am on Sun­day, though flight schedules from Tel Aviv were expected to be affected and travellers were advised to check flight times before going to Ben Gurion International Airport.
Flag carrier El Al said it had resumed operations and was “working to stabilise the flight schedule as soon as possible”.
“El Al will continue to operate as much as possible to preserve the air bridge to and from Israel,” it said. Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways cancelled flights to Jordan and Israel on Sunday, the airline said in a statement.
