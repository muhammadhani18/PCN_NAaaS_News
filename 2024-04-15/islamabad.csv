0,Sikh pilgrims celebrate Baisakhi at Gurdwara Punja Sahib,"Devotees perform ‘Bhog’, ‘Keerthan’ and Ardaas; to travel to Nankana Sahib today.","TAXILA: Several thousand Sikh devotees performed ‘Bhog’, the main ceremony of the Baisakhi festival, at Gurdwara Punja Sahib in Hassanabdal on Sunday, as the temple echoed with Sikh religious slogans.
Baisakhi, or Vaisakhi, is celebrated on the first day of the month of Vaisakh and also marks the beginning of the harvest season.
The festival was celebrated at Gurdwara Punja Sahib in Hassanabdal - the third most sacred city for the followers of the Sikh religion - by pilgrims who performed several rituals.
The Gurdwara was awash with colours as the pilgrims crammed the halls and the courtyards in their traditional yellow turbans.
Dressed up to the nines, the worshippers gathered in the early hours of Sunday to perform the rituals which marked the conclusion of the three-day reading of ‘Granth Sahib’ - the holy book of Sikhs.

Devotees perform ‘Bhog’, ‘Keerthan’ and Ardaas; to travel to Nankana Sahib today

It may be noted that Gurdwara Punja Sahib is considered important in the Sikh religion because Sikhs believe that a handprint of Sikhism founder Baba Guru Nanak is imprinted on a boulder at the gurdwara.

On this occasion, girls from the Khalsa School in Peshawar recited hymns.
Following ‘Bhog’, the pilgrims performed ‘Keerthan’ for purification followed by ‘Ardaas’ (prayer). This marked the formal conclusion of the festival and ‘prasad’ (sweetmeats) was also distributed among the pilgrims.
At the end, the ‘Palki’ procession was also taken out during which the passion of the Sikh pilgrims reached its crescendo.
This year’s festival marks the 325rd anniversary of Khalsa - the pure ones - a moniker for the Sikh brotherhood.
It is one of the most significant holidays in the Nanaksahi Sikh calendar, commemorating the establishment of the Khalsa in Anandpur Sahib in 1699 by the 10th Sikh Guru Gobind Singh.
According to reports, around 8,000 Sikhs attended the celebrations. Of these, over 2,400 Sikhs came from India while over 2,000 came from other countries, including the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, and Gulf countries. As many as 2,000 Pakistani Hindus and Sikhs also attended the festival.
For the first time, diplomats from European and South East missions participated in the ceremony and witnessed Sikh devotees offering their rituals.
The leader of the Indian Sikh contingent, Sardar Kulwant Singh, in his address expressed satisfaction over the arrangements made for the pilgrims. In their speeches, representatives of Sikh groups from different countries lauded the Kartarpur corridor and thanked the government for fulfilling their longstanding demand.
Amritsar’s Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) party leader Sardar Rawinder Singh told journalists that special love for Pakistanis compelled them to visit the country repeatedly.
“We are grateful to the Pakistan government, particularly the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), for making arrangements for the protection of gurdwaras in Pakistan,” he added.
Talking to journalists, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif claimed that the government was committed to providing complete religious freedom to people of all faiths living in the country.
Responding to a question, he said that the Sikh Marriage Act had been passed in 2018 and would be implemented after the approval of the Punjab cabinet.
He said that around six gurdwaras would be opened across the country and handed over to the Sikh community.
Earlier, speaking at the Bhog ceremony, Khawaja Asif said that the people of Pakistan and the government were proud to host the Sikh pilgrims in their holy land.
ETPB Additional Secretary Rana Shahid said the pilgrims would travel to Nankana Sahib from Hasanabdal today, where they would pay homage at ‘Sacha Sauda’ (Farooqabad) during their stay.
This will be followed by a visit to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur (Narowal) on April 18, he said, adding that the pilgrimage will continue with a visit to Gurdwara Rori Sahib in Eminabad on April 20. The devotees will leave Pakistan on April 22 following the completion of their 10-day pilgrimage, he added.
National Rahmatul-lil-Alameen Authority Chairman Khurshid Ahmad Nadeem and its director general, Zaffar Mehmood Malik, also participated in the Bhog ceremony.

The officers from the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Islamabad collected data of 242 house servants across 520 houses within Khanna and Banigala police station areas, a police public relations officer (PRO) said on Sunday.
The registration drive is part of an effort to maintain law and order in the capital and keep a check on potentially dangerous individuals by gathering information of tenants and domestic workers.
The police teams visited various neighbourhoods to gather data and talk to residents about any challenges they face. Besides, the officers also advised citizens to verify the identity of anyone collecting data while in plain clothes. The unregistered tenants and employees may pose a risk to public safety, as they can be involved in theft and robbery.
Following the campaign, Islamabad police hope to create a safer environment for residents by using their resources effectively.

3,Fate of three key traffic management projects hangs in balance,Official says civic agency focused on completing ongoing projects,"ISLAMABAD: Though the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has spent billions of rupees on road projects in the recent past, three main intersections which have been a constant source of traffic jams still await the attention of the civic agency.
The residents face traffic congestion at three points - Serena Chowk, Shaheen Chowk and PTCL Chowk - which is the intersection of 9th Avenue and Jinnah Avenue. Last year, the CDA was all set to start the construction work of Serena Interchange – where Srinagar Highway, Khayaban-i-Suharwardi, Attaturk Avenue and Club Road converge.
The project was supposed to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in August last year (during his first tenure) and tenders were also approved.
However, the prime minister after reaching the inauguration site refused to inaugurate the project when he was informed that Railcop had won the contract. Railcop is a government-owned company and a subsidiary of Pakistan Railways.

Official says civic agency focused on completing ongoing projects

While leaving the inauguration ceremony, he had said that Railcop had no experience in the construction of interchanges and underpasses and sought a detailed presentation from the CDA on the tendering process.
However, the government’s tenure ended before the presentation was held and the bid validity period also lapsed. Subsequently, the CDA shelved this project.
In July last year, in response to a tender by the CDA, Railcop turned out to be the lowest bidder. It had a bid of Rs2.1 billion against NLC’s bid of Rs3.5 billion.
Under the said project, the Srinagar Highway from 7th Avenue Interchange to Serena Chowk was also slated to be widened with two additional lanes. Furthermore, a portion of the highway from the junction to Murree Road would have been overhauled as well, which would have taken six months to complete.
Like the said project, the tendering process of Shaheen Chowk on Faisal Avenue was also completed last year and three construction firms took part in the process. After technical bids, the financial bids were however not opened.
The CDA also completed the environmental impact assessment of the project and a public hearing was also conducted. But, the fate of this project still hangs in balance.
Similarly, PTCL Chowk is also a troubling point for motorists. During peak hours, commuters face prolonged traffic signals. Officials told Dawn that the civic agency had announced to take up this project multiple times but even its PC-I was not prepared.
“We have resolved the traffic mess in the city except for these three areas. Once these three projects are completed, the issue of traffic congestion in the city will be resolved,” said a CDA deputy director.
The official said these projects were not on the priority list of the CDA management due to funding issues and the agency was focused on the completion of the ongoing projects.
“We do agree that these three projects are important. The PC-I of two of them are already okayed while the PC-I of the PTCL Chowk will also be prepared soon,” said a CDA official.
The official said the civic body would take steps to move forward soon but at present it was focused on finishing the ongoing projects, such as the multi-billion expressway widening project.

4,Naanbais refuse to follow govt-set prices,"Association president says it is not possible to sell Roti, Naan at reduced rates when prices of
flour are going up","RAWALPINDI: Naanbais in the city have rejected Punjab government’s direction to sell Roti and Naan at Rs16 and Rs20, respectively.
On the direction of the government, the district administration on Sunday fixed the rates of Roti at Rs16 and Naan at Rs20.
However, All Pakistan Naanbais Association President Shafique Qureshi rejected the new rates and said they were getting wheat flour at higher rates and it was not possible for them to reduce the prices.
He said the price of Roti was Rs20 and Naan Rs25. “We were paying Rs8,200 for a 79 kg bag of plain flour and Rs9,200 for a bag of fine flour (maida).” 

Association president says it is not possible to sell Roti, Naan at reduced rates when prices of
  flour are going up

However, he claimed that on Sunday the price of plain flour had gone up to Rs11,800 and that of fine flour to Rs12,200. It is not possible for naanbais to sell Roti and Naan at the reduced rates when prices of flour are going up.
“The price of LPG cylinders has also increased and tariffs of natural gas have gone up by 200 per cent in the last two months. We also have to pay other bills.” 
He said they were in contact with other associations across the country to launch a protest against the government and a meeting would be held in Islamabad to chalk out a plan soon.
Mr Qureshi said the caretaker government in Punjab and the district administration had been informed about the rising flour prices, but they turned a blind eye to it.
He said before taking any decision, the government should take all stakeholders into confidence but the new prices were issued without any consultation.
On the other hand, the residents welcomed the decision of the government to reduce prices of Roti and Naan. They said the government should ensure implementation of the new prices.
However, most of the people said there was no chance of getting the new rates implemented as traders ignored prices of edibles like milk, curd and meat fixed by the government. 
The district administration had issued a price list of edibles on March 9 before the start of Ramazan, but the price magistrates failed to implement it giving shopkeepers a free hand to overcharge consumers. 
According the official list, the price of milk was Rs170 to Rs190 per litre for low fat and high fat, respectively, but in the market it was being sold at Rs220 per litre. The price of curd was fixed at Rs200 but it was selling at Rs230 per kg.
Similarly, the price of mutton was fixed at Rs1,600 per kg but it was available at Rs2,200 to Rs2,300 per kg while beef rate was fixed at Rs800 per kg and it was being sold at Rs1,150 to Rs1,200 per kg.

9,Diversion eases traffic on portion of Murree Road: ITP,Official says Islamabad-bound traffic is diverted to road on opposite side from Lake View Park to Kashmir Chowk,"ISLAMABAD: In order to ensure smooth flow of traffic on a portion of Murree Road from Lake View Park to Kashmir Chowk, Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) have started diverting traffic to the opposite side. 
According to the ITP, this experiment has helped in ensuring smooth flow of traffic. 
“For the last three days, in the evening we are diverting traffic to the opposite side to use one lane,” Inspector Tanveer Khan of ITP, who was performing duty at the site, told Dawn.
He said after Eid extra traffic was entering Islamabad, therefore, one lane of the opposite side (which leads towards Murree) was being used for Islamabad-bound traffic. Near the entrance to the Lake View Park, the ITP officials after blocking the road heading towards Islamabad have diverted the traffic to the road on the opposite side leading towards Murree on which there is now thin traffic.

Official says Islamabad-bound traffic is diverted to road on opposite side from Lake View Park to Kashmir Chowk

Similarly, a portion of Murree Road heading towards the hill resort is also closed for diversion and traffic is moved towards the road which passes from the rear of Convention Centre where after taking a U-turn it move towards Murree on a single lane up to Lake View Chowk. It was noticed that there was no smooth flow of traffic but at least it continued at a slow pace.
Meanwhile, Serena Chowk is blocked for entering Khyaban-i-Suharwardi as New Zealand’s cricket team is staying in the hotel, causing traffic mess at the signal. However, Srinagar Highway is opened.
Every year during Eid holidays, thousands of people throng Lake View Park, causing traffic jams. After the holidays when people return from Kashmir and Murree, the said portion of the road faces congestion. 
Earlier, motorists had to face the same situation in Bhara Kahu area, however, after construction of the bypass road the issue has been resolved as traffic to and from Murree and Kashmir uses the bypass road smoothly. 
The portion of Murree Road from Kashmir Chowk to short of Lake View Park is congested compared to other portion of the main road. On both sides of the road, there is vast vacant area and the road could be widened easily to avoid gridlocks on Eid and other holidays when a large number of people visit Lake View Park.

10,Five firms qualify for bidding to repair Rawalpindi metro bus track,"Elevated road from Saddar to Faizabad will be repaired in first phase, says official.","RAWALPINDI: Five firms have qualified to take part in the bidding process to repair the metro bus elevated track from Saddar to Faizabad next month.
Punjab Masstransit Authority has released Rs740 million for the repair of the elevated road from Saddar to Faizabad.
The cost of the repair work is estimated to be Rs625 million with the remaining budget allocated for additional expenses. After this, repair work on the metro track from Faizabad to Pakistan Secretariat in Islamabad will start.
A senior official of the RDA told Dawn that the bidding will be held next week and work on the project will start by the end of April and was likely be completed within 10 months.
He said Nespak had completed a survey and recommended that the track was in dire need of repair nine years after its construction.

Elevated road from Saddar to Faizabad will be repaired in first phase, says official

He said the Punjab Mass Transit Authority had asked the RDA to carry out the repair work as it had completed the project in 2015, adding the RDA would get funds from the Punjab government. He said in the initial phase, the elevated road from Saddar to Faizabad will be repaired.
Punjab Mass Transit Authority General Manager (Operations) Uzair Shah told Dawn that heavy rains in the last two years had damaged the roads of the metro bus service in Rawalpindi and Islamabad that required repair.
He said they wanted to repair the tough tiles on the pavements and it had been decided to change them with concrete pavements. Potholes that have developed on the corridors of the bus stations would also be repaired.
He also said the repair work would be held in three phases, and RDA had been asked to select the areas.
The track would not be closed for repair and the operation of the buses would continue on the construction site.
The total length of the metro bus corridor is 23 km, including 8.6 km elevated, 10 km at grade and a four km trench.
The portion of metro bus service in Rawalpindi from Flashman’s Hotel to Faizabad has a distance of 8.6 km and is elevated while in Islamabad, the 14.6 km is on ground, starting from Faizabad to Pak Secretariat via IJP Road and 9th Avenue.

11,Pakistani climbers aiming to scale world’s all 14 highest peaks,ACP says Sajid Sadpara currently on conquest of third highest peak,"ISLAMABAD: Despite the nation’s rich mountaineering legacy, it has yet to claim a climber who has conquered all 14 of the highest peaks in the world. 
However, this narrative might soon undergo a significant shift with climbers like Sajid Sadpara leading the charge, said Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP).
Renowned for its formidable peaks, including five of the world’s towering 8,000 metres mountains, Pakistan stands on the cusp of mountaineering history, said ACP secretary Karrar Haidri.
Sajid Sadpara, son of the late legendary climber Mohammad Ali Sadpara, was currently embarking on a monumental journey towards the 8,586 metres tall Kangchenjunga in Nepal and the third highest peak in the world. Should he succeed, it would mark his ninth conquest of an 8,000 metres peak. 
ACP said what set Sajid Sadpara apart was his remarkable feat of scaling these peaks without the aid of supplementary oxygen, a feat he accomplished even on Mt Everest last year. Once again, Sajid Sadpara would brave the unforgiving heights as part of the rope-fixing team, eschewing bottled oxygen and personal sherpa support.

ACP says Sajid Sadpara currently on conquest of third highest peak

Following Kangchenjunga, Sajid Sadpara’s odyssey continued with four more mountains on his agenda the 8,516 metres Lhotse (4th highest in the world), 8,485 metres Makalu (5th highest) and the formidable Tibetan giants 8,188 metres Cho Oyu (6th highest) and Shisha Pangma 8,027 metres, 14th highest peak in the world.
Meanwhile, two other Pakistani climbers, Sirbaz Khan and Shehroze Kashif, also had their sights set on Shisha Pangma, aiming to etch their names in mountaineering lore by completing their 14×8,000m quest on the Tibetan giant.
ACP pointed out that Sirbaz Khan, known for his indomitable spirit and swift ascent, often collaborated with Mingma G’s Imagine Nepal team. With 10 of his 138,000-metre summits conquered without supplementary oxygen. Khan’s prowess on the mountains has earned him accolades from the mountaineering community.
On the other hand, Shehroze Kashif, one of the youngest faces in the high-altitude climbing scene, has been supported by Seven Summit Treks throughout his mountaineering endeavours. Having shattered age records with his ascent of Broad Peak at the age of 17, Shehroze Kashif continued to make waves in the mountaineering world.
Among Pakistani women, Naila Kiani has been a beacon of inspiration, achieving her 10th 8,000 metres summit by conquering Cho Oyu last fall. Despite her ambitious plans to tackle Shisha Pangma, avalanches halted her journey, underscoring the unpredictable and perilous nature of high-altitude mountaineering.
As the mountaineering community eagerly awaited their next moves, Naila Kiani, in particular, aimed to foster a culture of athleticism among Pakistani women, hoping to ignite a passion for sports and adventure in the younger generation.
Mr Haidri said that in a nation where only one per cent of women participated in sports, Naila Kiani’s achievements served as a testament to the boundless potential of Pakistani mountaineers, inspiring future generations to reach new heights both on and off the mountains.
