1,ANP asks KP govt to take up provincial rights issue with centre,Provincial general secretary Sardar Hussain Babak warns the people would not forgive PTI if it didn’t deliver on its promises.,"BAJAUR: Awami National Party’s provincial general secretary Sardar Hussain Babak on Sunday asked the PTI government to raise a strong voice with the centre for getting the due rights of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  
He said his party would stand by the provincial government if it effectively took up the provincial rights issue with the central government. 
“Since a majority of KP people have voted for PTI, so the party’s government should take up the matter of provincial rights with the federal government,” he said while addressing a gathering held in Khar. 
Awami National Party formally launched the campaign for the April 21 by-election on NA-8 and PK-22 seats here. 
Mr Babak warned the people would not forgive the PTI if it didn’t deliver on its promises. 
He suggested the provincial government hold a sit-in in Islamabad if the federal government wasn’t ready to give due rights to the people of KP. 
He said Awami National Party was concerned over the prolonged delay in provision of due rights of the province by the central government, adding his party would extend all-out support to the PTI government if it effectively pursued the case with the centre. 
Mr Babak claimed the resources of Pakhtuns were being usurped, but there was no one to raise voice against it in the parliament. 
He claimed that the ‘true’ representatives of Pakhtuns were made to lose the Feb 8 elections as some forces didn’t want a strong voice for the rights of Pakhtuns in the parliament. 
The Awami National Party provincial general secretary asked the participants to follow the non-violence philosophy of Abdul Ghafar Khan and also spread it among people. 
He urged the participants to ensure the victory of the party’s candidates – Maulana Khan Zeb and Shah Naseer Khan – in the by-elections.  
ANP Bajaur president Gul Afzal Khan, Maulana Khan Zeb, Shah Naseer Khan and others also spoke on the occasion.

2,Apni Basti housing project consigned to oblivion,Scheme for homeless people was launched by Mohammad Khan Junejo in 1987,"HARIPUR: With ever rising population rendered homeless following natural disasters or otherwise in the country, the housing projects launched for poor and low income citizens in Haripur remained abandoned as 10 successive governments since 1988 failed to find the utility of its costly land and leftover structures.
The then prime minister Mohammad Khan Junejo launched ‘Apni Basti’ project, also known as, 7-marla scheme in 1987 to build 150,000 housing units for low income and poor citizens. 
However, only 35,000 houses could be constructed across the country before the then president Gen Ziaul Haq sent his government packing in May 1988.
For the poor of Haripur district, two sites, one each in Kot Najibullah and Pharhala, were selected for the construction of housing units. 
Each unit was supposed to have two rooms, a kitchen and a washroom and an open space in front of each lane of five houses, to be used by the owners as courtyard-cum-street commonly.

Scheme for homeless people was launched by Mohammad Khan Junejo in 1987

For Pharhala Apni Basti site, provincial secretary of physical planning and housing acquired a 150-kanal piece of land to build 140 residential quarters but only 40 units could be constructed.
For Kotnajibullah Apni Basti site, provincial government acquired about 100-kanal for a similar number of housing units and 25 were built. However, none of the homeless persons could benefit from both the multimillion projects.
It was observed that the scheme had too many flaws, including unrealistic pricing, unsuitable locations and lacking easy availability of basic amenities like water, electricity and gas.
Poor monitoring and security arrangements eventually led to stealing of door and window frames and bricks. In Kot Najibullah, a couple of units could survive the broad day robbery sprees as being occupied by the tenants of local influential people. 
Likewise in Pahrhala, partial structures of walls and roof are still intact but the miscreants are busy removing bricks of units slowly.
By following the deep rooted political culture of abandoning the projects of predecessors, the 10 successive governments failed to complete the scheme although both PPP and PML-N and later PTI launched different housing projects during their tenures yet they ignored the Apni Basti project that requires less investment against the new one.
According to the census 2023, Haripur district alone has 137 individuals, 79 male and 58 female, as homeless. As per census 2017, there are 38,415 homeless people in Pakistan and KP province constitute 11.3 per cent of the total shelter-less population while according to independent statistics shared by Muslim Aid organisation there are 20 million homeless people in the country.
A site visit to both the sites and review of revenue record show that of the 150-kanal land of abandoned Apni Basti project, the ANP-PPP coalition government had allotted 30-kanal to local journalists for Haripur Media Colony, which is still in limbo since 2012.
A piece of land of similar size was carved out for Girls Degree College Pharhala that is quite functional right now and the remaining land and open space between the houses is now being used for sowing seasonal crops by local influential people. Interestingly, the legal status of occupation of land is not known.
The leftover housing structures are put to disappear without any repair and maintenance or utility.
Likewise, in Kot Najibullah the same land was used for agriculture purposes but who allotted the land to whom and under what conditions are still enigma even for the officials of revenue department.
“Give these incomplete units and even the white space to genuinely poor and homeless people on merit basis to save it from the illegal grabbers,” said Niaz Khan, a social activist. He said that the village and neighbourhood council chairmen should be tasked to prepare the lists of homeless people.

3,Pashto folk singers release over 500 albums online for fans on Eid,PESHAWAR: Folk singers across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa released over 500 albums online for fans on the occasion of Eidul...,"PESHAWAR: Folk singers across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa released over 500 albums online for fans on the occasion of Eidul Fitr, with music experts terming it the largest number ever as digital studios around the capital city made it easier for the folk artists to get their items recorded effortlessly and in less cost. 
Over 50 Pashto folk singers engaged around as many music studios equipped with digital equipment, which have sprung up in the capital city during the last few years, where experts, including music composers, producers and artists, remain busy bringing out fresh songs on Eid and other propitious events.  
Noted folk artists, including Karan Khan, Shah Farooq, Falal Naz Marwat, Laila Khan and Zeeshan Khan, brought albums for their fans on Eid. 
“Music has witnessed a considerable change owing to modern digital era as traditional music faced a tough challenge, but still senior artists were not ready to succumb to the ‘change’ because they believed traditional music would continue touching hearts of the audience due to quality stuff,” said Haroon Khan, a young music buff. 
Some senior folk singers said they would release their albums online after a week or two of the Eid event to avoid being lost among huge buzz of singers.  
“Our fans and followers expect quality stuff from us while most so-called singers least care for the quality and standard of their compositions,” Asfandyar Momand, a folk artist, said. 
Rashid Ahmad Khan, president of music welfare society, told this scribe that despite high inflation and financial crunch, folk artists were able to bring out over 500 fresh albums comprising lyrics for the occasion of Eid. He said most were eager to put their songs on their YouTube channels for fans and followers. 
“There are over 50 music studios in Peshawar alone, all equipped with modern digital facilities. Afghan artists also use these studios for their online Eid releases as music studios in Afghanistan were dismantled after the Taliban took over Kabul in August 2021. Most of them shot outdoor shoots on several attractive locations in KP,” he added. 
“Despite the fact that studio charges range from Rs8,000 to Rs10,000 per new item, several young singers still approach these music facilities for recording their debut songs to attract more audiences on social media,” Rahmat Wali, a studio technician, said.

They said that researchers and intellectuals were yet to explore Khushal Khan Khattak’s vision, his multilayered personality traits and leadership qualities. 
“His celebrated book ‘Dastarnama’ written in prison is still a valid document for several disciplines being taught in today’s university level,” they added.
Pabbi Intellectual Forum (PIF) arranged a comprehensive debate on the life and works of Khushal Khan Khattak. Literati, intellectuals and research scholars participated in the debate and shared their scholarly views.
Dr Mian Iftikhar Hussain, a noted psychiatrist, in his opening remarks said that PIF had planned since long to bring under discussion 
various aspects of Khushal Khan Khattak, especially his social and political contribution, and its monthly debate was dedicated to open deliberation.
Prof Noorul Amin Yousafzai was the keynote speaker while Gul Akbar Khan chaired the event.
Mr Yousafzai said that Khushal Khan Khattak authored Dastarnama when he was put behind bars by Mughal king. Khushal Khan Khattak’s influence on Allama Iqbal’s thoughts was a well-known fact.
He said that Khushal Khan Khattak described qualities and arts of a national leader with a stress on farsightedness, high moral strength, confidence and refine aesthetic sense alongside bravery and the spirit to lead the people in the said book.
Quoting one of his inspirational couplets, he said that Khushal Khan Khattak envisioned that the entire world could be made to live in perfect peace together provided that the spirit of reconciliation and dialogue and mutual trust remained intact.
Leader should be impeccable, reliable and brave to lead his people by setting his personal example and should instill the spirit of piety, inclusivity and respect for views of others among masses.
A local folk artist also sang popular numbers of Khushal Khan Khattak that earned applause while selected poems were shared on the occasion.
The speeches were followed by an interesting question and answer session in which panelists responded to the queries of participants.

5,Bajaur’s nursing college awaits classes since construction in 2006,DC promises to take up matter with relevant authorities,"BAJAUR: A government nursing college in Bajaur, which is the lone such facility in all the tribal districts, could not be made functional despite its construction about 18 years ago.
Sources privy to the matter told Dawn that the construction work on the two-storey building located near the District Headquarters Hospital in Khar was launched in 2002 and completed in 2006.
They said the institution was meant to offer a four-year nursing degree (BSc nursing) to students, including girls, who passed the higher secondary school certificate examination in science subjects.
The sources said the then director general health Fata, Dr Zubir Khan, during a visit to the building in May 2007, had announced it would be formally opened by September of that year.
However, the sources said classes couldn’t be launched in the college as per the stipulated time. They said the management of DHQ Hospital, which supervises the institution, had also sent SNE (sanctioned new expenditure) regarding the required equipment and staff to the provincial health department in November 2007.

DC promises to take up matter with relevant authorities 

The sources said then provincial health minister Dr Hisham Inamullah Khan during a visit to the district on January 14, 2019, had announced launching classes in the institution soon.
The sources said after the health minister’s announcement, the provincial health department had started provision of necessary equipment to the institution to start classes in July 2019.
But the sources said the institution, which is to enroll about 50 students annually, couldn’t be opened.
The sources said the college was later handed over to the Provincial Health Services Academy (PHSA) in 2020.
Soon after taking control of the institution, PHSA decided to make the college functional by the end of 2020, and had also recruited essential staff, including the principal and some instructors (teaching staff). But the sources said the college could not be made functional.
The sources said the prolonged delay in making the college functional was not only forcing students to get enrolled in nursing colleges of Peshawar, Mardan, Swat, Timergara and other cities, but also damaging the valuable equipment.
Both the college building and the adjacent hostel are in bad shape. The hostel is currently in use by the nursing staff of the DHQ Hospital.
When contacted, a senior official of the health department confirmed to Dawn that the nursing college had been lying non-functional since its establishment in 2006.
The official wishing not to be unnamed said though the institution had been under the control of PHSA, an autonomous body, since 2020, non-availability of required staff, shortage of essential equipment and lack of interest by the relevant authority were said to be the reasons behind the prolonged delay in its opening.
Meanwhile, deputy commissioner Mohammad Anwarul Haq said he would take up the matter with the relevant authorities to ensure that it was made functional as soon as possible.

10,PHC outgoing chief justice says he stood against ‘onslaught’ on rule of law,Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim takes oath as acting chief justice today,"PESHAWAR: The outgoing chief justice of Peshawar High Court, Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan, has said that he stood solid against every odd attempt to thwart justice in the face of unprecedented challenges and onslaught on the rule of law and supremacy of Constitution.
“I annihilated all shadows subverting the supremacy of law in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Though the battle cost me career progression yet believe me, it is my sheer success that Allah Almighty granted me strength and wisdom to confront the formidable challenges with firm resolve,” he said.
Justice Khan, who retired on Sunday after serving judiciary for 31 years, was addressing a farewell get together organised in his honour by district and sessions judges and principal officers of high court on Saturday night.
The function was also addressed by the high court chief justice-designate, Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, who will take oath as acting chief justice today (Monday).

Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim takes oath as acting chief justice today

“I have been deciding high profile cases amidst peculiar law and order situation and political turmoil in our motherland wherein my commitment to uphold the rule of law and supremacy of Constitution have been unshakable and unyielding,” said Justice Khan who served as chief justice of PHC for more than nine months.
He stated that that fear of Allah Almighty always remained with him as a guiding light while taking each and every step in life. “Throughout my tenure, I have faced numerous challenges, from shifts in legal paradigms to the ever-evolving demands of public trust and technological advancements,” he added. 
Justice Khan said: “Nevertheless, each obstacle has been met with the unwavering commitment and profound dedication of my brother judges to upholding the law with integrity, fairness and an unyielding respect for the principles of justice.”
He said when he first stepped into the role of chief justice, he was acutely aware of the immense responsibilities that lay ahead and the profound impact their decisions had on the fabric of society. “It has been an honour of the highest order to serve the cause of justice alongside my brother judges and distinguished judges of our esteemed district courts,” he added.
Justice Khan, who was elevated to high court as additional judge in August 2016 and subsequently confirmed in June 2018, said that deep inside his heart he was extremely contended and happy as he had done justice with the oath he was administered with. “I can safely proclaim this on the Day of Judgment before the lord of the lords that your slave has performed his duty as is ordained to him,” he added.

11,Chitralis pin high hopes on legislators to work for  their uplift,"CHITRAL: The Chitral region with a population of only 500,000 people has got five lawmakers in the provincial...","CHITRAL: The Chitral region with a population of only 500,000 people has got five lawmakers in the provincial assembly, two in the National Assembly and one in the Senate with hopes they would work collectively for development of the area. 
In the February 8 elections, Chitral had got one seat of national and two seats of provincial assembly, and the rest of them were elected on the reserved seats for women. 
PTI-backed candidates Abdul Latif returned from NA-1, Suraya Bibi from PK-1 and Fatehul Mulk Ali Nasir from PK-2, while Khadija Bibi, Arifa Bibi and Nilofar Baber were nominees of ANP, JUI-F and PPP, respectively. 
Ghazala Anjum had been nominated by PML-N for the reserved seat in National Assembly, while Falak Naz was already in the Senate nominated by PTI two years ago, thus taking the tally of legislators to eight. 
Former district nazim Maghfirat Shah said hopes of the people were justifiable due to the legislators’ strength coupled with the fact that there were two MPAs belonging to the ruling party in the province and one PML-N MNA in the centre. 
However, he regretted that Chitral lagged far behind in the road communication sector as it formed the basis of all other sectors of development. He asked the legislators both in the centre and the province to concentrate on this crucial sector of development. “The people of Chitral needs be to gotten rid of pony tracks of British-era.” 
Some of the major arteries, including the Shandur, Garam Chashma and Kalash valleys roads, had been federalised, while the link roads are still in the province, and during the first two years, the provincial government should concentrate on roads only,” he said. 
Rahmat Elahi, chairman of Chitral Community Development Network, the umbrella organisation of 23 local support organisations located across Chitral, said health was yet another neglected sector, which needed to be focused. 
He said hospitals were short of doctors and diagnostic apparatus.

12,Govt fails to enact law for prevention of child marriage,Report says child brides are victims of physiological traumas and reproductive health issues,"MANSEHRA: With a significant number of child marriage cases, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is still without any legislation to effectively check underage wedlock.
According to government’s Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health Project, which has been launched in 10 of 38 districts of the province since 2021, child brides are the worst victims of physiological traumas and reproductive health issues compared with their counterparts married off in the age of 20 and above.
Its report says that depression, marriage adjustment, anxieties, miscarriages, feeble health and medical issues and iron deficiency are common among child marriage couples, mostly in girls.
“This initiative assesses mental and sexual health of adolescents as they reach puberty and start facing psychological health-related issues through various phenomenon,” says Dr Lubna Safeer, the district head of the programme.

Report says child brides are victims of physiological traumas and reproductive health issues

She says that five of 10 female patients taken to health centres with reproductive health and psychological issues are child bridges in Hazara division. “This ratio is slightly higher in rest of the province,” she adds.
Dr Lubna says that government as well as society has not been taking child marriage as a serious issue as such couples, mostly girls, subsequently face physiological and mental health, hygienic and sexual and medical complications.
The initiative currently in progress in Mansehra, Malakand, Swabi, Mardan, Chitral, Lakki Marwat, Dir, Nowshera, Haripur and Dera Ismail Khan since 2021 to do away with child marriages is yet to cover the rest of the province.
Pakistan, which has still been exercising a slightly less than century-old Child Marriage Restrain Act of 1929, stands sixth in countries with the highest child marriage having a ratio of around 30 per cent.
Following the passage of Eighteenth Amendment in 2010, though legislation falls into the provinces’ domain, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces have yet to enact such a law, which can effectively deal with child marriages.
The British-era law determines a girl’s minimum age for her wedding at 16 years, and for a boy 18 years but it is lenient to deal effectively with contraveners as it punishes the latter with a jailed term of a month in maximum, and a fine not exceeding Rs1,000.
Sindh and Punjab governments have repealed Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929, and invoked Child Marriage Restraint Act in 2013 and 2015, respectively, to deal with child marriages.
“It is a patriarchal mindset, which is one of the hurdles in centre, KP and Balochistan to legislate on premature matches. All three have still been exercising aged Child Marriage Restrain Act, 1929,” says Advocate Sharafat A Chaudhry, a legal expert on legislation.
He says that fundamental challenges of patriarchal institutional structures, interpretation of religion, poverty, limited access to education and government unwillingness to enforce birth registration are its major reasons.
The legal expert says that lawmakers from 2014 to 2023 made efforts to get Child Marriage Constrain Act, 1929, amended or repealed or make it consonant with the prevailing world, even Federal Sharia Court had given a green signal to parliament to go ahead, but no to avail.
The National Commission on the Status of Women also made last-ditch efforts in 2023 to get that British-era law amended by National Assembly but it also met with the same past standoff.
The NCSW envisions an amended law marriage age for either sex of 18-year and the Nikkak registrar (cleric) can only solemnise wedlock when a bride and bridegroom can produce their Computerised National Identity Cards.
It seeks punishment clauses amended to adjudicate child marriage cases only in family courts and enhance simple one-month imprisonment, and a fine of Rs1,000 in the existing ACT to rigorous imprisonment of three years and not shorter than two years and a fine of Rs200,000 for violators.

14,"Glofs threaten lives, livelihoods in northern areas","Residents demand efforts to ease their misery, foster resilience","SWAT: Glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) have wreaked havoc on people’s lives and livelihoods in the picturesque valleys of Utror, Gabral, and Mankiyal in northern Pakistan.
The residents told Dawn that the catastrophic events triggered by the accelerated melting of glaciers due to climate change had uprooted entire villages, leaving locals displaced and fearing for their future.
A recent report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) highlights the alarming surge in Glof occurrences in Pakistan, with 83 such events recorded in 2023 alone.
Experts warned that the incidence would escalate, posing a grave threat to the vulnerable communities in those areas.

Residents demand efforts to ease their misery, foster resilience

They said the devastation unleashed by Glofs extended beyond the physical destruction of agricultural lands to profound psychological distress among locals, who grappled with the constant specter of future disasters.
For many residents, the trauma is compounded by the loss of homes, livestock, and livelihoods.
Bilal Khan of the Kamarkhwa area recounted the harrowing ordeal of his family.
“Fortunately, we took refuge on higher ground and were unharmed, but the floodwaters wiped away all of our houses, cattle, and pastures,” he said.
The lives of many others have also been upended by calamitous floods.
Farmers in the Utror area, who were once able to sustain their families through agriculture, are grappling with uncertainty and displacement.
“We used to grow vegetables and earn a livelihood, but now we are landless and struggling to make ends meet,” local grower Mohammad Qasim told Dawn.
Adilzada, another farmer in the area, recounted how the floods of 2022 devastated his entire agricultural land, compelling him to relocate to Mingora and take up labour work for his livelihood.
In response to the urgent humanitarian crisis, the UNDP, in collaboration with the Green Climate Fund, launched the ‘Scaling-up Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (Glof-II) in Northern Pakistan’ project, insisting the initiative is meant to fortify vulnerable communities by erecting protective infrastructure such as safe havens, slope stabilisation measures, and early warning systems.
However, the calamity-hit communities in the upper parts of Swat called for collective action to mitigate the Glof devastation.
They said local and international organisations should join forces to provide essential support and assistance to rebuild shattered lives and safeguard against future disasters.
The residents said Glofs had exacted a heavy toll on the inhabitants of northern Pakistan, and therefore, immediate intervention and sustained efforts were imperative to alleviate their plight and foster resilience in the face of mounting environmental challenges.
A representative of the UNDP said the Glacial Lake Outburst and Floods (Glof-II) Project, funded by the Green Climate Fund and implemented by the UNDP through the Ministry of Climate Change, was executed as a pilot project (Glof-I) from 2017 to 2019 and expanded to Glof-II until Dec 2024.
He added that the project was implemented in 10 districts of Gilgit-Baltistan and five districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, focusing on 16 valleys in GB and eight valleys in KP.
Interventions across the targeted valleys include the construction of protection walls, community centers, safe 
havens, irrigation channels, slope stabilization works, micro- watersheds, pony tracks, and early warning systems, while soft activities involve forming disaster risk reduction committees, conducting mock drills, awareness sessions, and kitchen gardening training for women, according to him.
“In KP, the progress includes the completion of protection walls, irrigation channels, safe havens, CBDRMC centers, slope stabilisation works, meteorological observatories, and platforms for early warning systems,” he said, adding that kitchen gardening training for women and the establishment of green climate clubs in schools have been carried out.

The town’s president Islamuddin claimed that the KDA police had found the hostel owner, Mr Firdos, stealing electricity, but they didn’t register a case against him. He said the police told the residents that they would ask the relevant sub-divisional officer of Peshawar Electric Supply Company to hold a probe into it first. 
When contacted, SHO Roman Shah told Dawn that the police would register an FIR if and when Pesco conducted a probe into the alleged power theft by the hostel owner. 
He claimed that the Federal Investigation Agency was also holding inquiries against the man in three different cases. 
Meanwhile, the project director of KDA Township, in a statement on Sunday, also asked the police to move against the hostel owner for ‘stealing’ power.

On the occasion, Malik Asif Ali, chairman of Sapat Sindhu Salhaarr, said Indus River was the ‘custodian’ of the ancient civilisation of Dera Ismail Khan and its water was a symbol of life. 
He said the government should devise a plan to prevent contamination of the river water. 
Dr Nauman Latif Saduzai, an environmentalist, said the polluted river water was also polluting the underground water. 
Author and intellectual Habib Mohana said the event was meant to appeal to the authorities to save River Indus from pollution. “Protecting River Indus from pollution is like protecting Saraiki culture and traditions,” Mr Mohana said. 
Qaiser Anwar, an author, intellectual and broadcaster, said the government should take steps to protect the Indus from pollution. 
Educationist Yaqoob Babar said climate change was affecting the entire world and its effects could clearly be seen in the Indus River. He said Saraiki people had been protesting the pollution of Indus to try to draw the government’s attention towards the grave matter.  
Saraiki Qaumi Tehreek chairman Mauz Arain said there was no check on municipal waste being emptied into the mighty Indus, which was a lifeline of Saraiki people. 
Known painter Ajab Khan (Sitara-i-Imtiaz), Syed Irshad Shah Bukhari, Tahir Shirazi, Abul Muazzam Turabi, Ramish Ali and others said the Indus River was their life and they wanted to keep it clean and free from pollution.
