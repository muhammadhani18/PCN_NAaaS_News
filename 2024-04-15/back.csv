2,PM Shehbaz urges use of renewable sources for power generation,Premier highlights nation imports oil worth $27 billion for power generation and transportation,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged the energy ministry to use alternative and renewable sources for power generation to decrease reliance on imported fuels.
The prime minister made these remarks during a high-level meeting on Monday. While reviewing the progress of power sector projects, the premier emphasized the nation's considerable hydel potential and directed for a comprehensive utilization of all available resources.
He highlighted that the nation presently imports oil valued at $27 billion to fulfil its requirements for power generation and transportation, a sum that could be substantially decreased through the adoption of alternative energy sources.
“Ultimately, we have to move to renewable energy. The oil import worth billions of dollars can be controlled by using alternative resources like solar, wind and hydel. Make cold calculations and I believe, you will be the winner in the long term,” the PM remarked.
He stated that embracing renewable energy resources would help eliminate the influence of the oil tanker mafia, which he referred to as a burden on national finances.
The PM noted the prevailing nationwide rain spell as a promising advancement in augmenting water levels within rivers and reservoirs and emphasized its advantageous impact on power generation.
However, he expressed profound condolences for the loss of lives and property damages incurred due to the recent torrential rains and urged swift action from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to expedite rescue and relief efforts in affected areas.

Additionally, the PM instructed close coordination with Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (PDMA) to ensure the timely provision of essential relief supplies to affected communities.
Energy Theft
During the meeting, the premier also commended the Punjab government for its tangible efforts in combating power theft throughout the province.
He urged other provinces to also implement comprehensive measures to curb electricity theft.
The premier remarked on the deplorable state of the power distribution system and transmission lines in the country, emphasizing the urgent necessity for a comprehensive overhaul of the entire electricity infrastructure, which he mandated would require substantial investment in the sector.
He also instructed the energy ministry to enlist the services of internationally renowned consultants in the power sector to rectify the deficiencies in the power system.
A day earlier, on April 14, the World Bank agreed to provide a $1 billion loan for the 2,160 megawatts Dasu hydropower project - a crucial initiative aimed at integrating cheaper electricity into Pakistan’s energy mix and showcasing the nation’s resilience against adversaries.
Pakistan’s power sector grapples with challenges such as high electricity generation costs, over-reliance on fossil fuels, and fixed capacity payments.
Yesterday, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) also revealed that the high cost of electricity was one of the contributing factors for decreasing the country’s economic growth rate to only 0.29% in the financial year 2022-23.
The situation has worsened due to the addition of large coal and imported gas power plants with take-or-pay contracts over the past decade. These plants increased capacity payments by 50% and exposed the country to international fossil fuel price volatility.
The current average cost of electricity generation in Pakistan is US cents 8.5 per unit, driven up by the average cost of thermal generation exceeding US cents 10 per unit.

The three candidates who challenged the election results from their respective constituencies included Aamir Mughal from NA-46 Islamabad, Shoaib Shaheen from NA-47, and Ali Bukhari from NA-48.
On April 13, six opposition parties including PTI joined to form a “grand opposition alliance” named Tehreek Tahafuz-e-Aain (TTA)“ against the incumbent 'rigged' government set-up.
The alliance kicked off its protest movement against alleged rigging in the February 8 general elections from Balochistan by staging two separate public gatherings in Pishin and Chaman on Saturday.
Former parliamentary leader at Sindh assembly and NA-241 candidate, Khurrum Sher Zaman also submitted the NA-241 rigging case to the election tribunal on March 22.
Last month, on February 20, during an informal media talk inside Adiala jail, PTI supremo Imran Khan denounced the poll irregularities as the ""mother of all rigging,"" asserting that it has turned Pakistan into a global laughing stock.

One rain-related fatality, caused by a lightning strike, was reported from Shikarpur district. The rain, accompanied by strong gusts, not only tempered the soaring temperatures to below 30 degrees Celsius in many cities but also transformed the weather into a pleasant affair.
Complaints of prolonged outages emerged from various parts of the province. Three towers of 11,000 KV fell in the Jamshoro district early in the morning due to strong winds, leading to the suspension of the electric supply in many areas of Kotri town.
The complaints about faults in the transmission system and pole-mounted transformers of Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) and Sukkur Electric Power Company (SEPCO) also abound.
The rain has also caused fears among the wheat farmers whose harvest is still awaiting purchase by either the government or the market traders.
Meanwhile, a collision between a passenger coach and a coaster on the M9 Motorway in Jamshoro district, precipitated by rainfall, tragically resulted in the loss of four lives and left a minimum of 20 passengers, including women and children, injured.

Similarly, various parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, including Mirpur division and the adjoining areas, have been lashed with unexpected heavy rains since mid-last night, turning the weather pleasant and reducing the just-started warm spell to a greater extent.    
The weather partially impacted the electricity, roads, and telecommunication systems in various areas of the Mirpur division, encompassing Kotli, Mirpur, and Bhimbher districts, as per reports from the Meteorological Department, AJK.
There were also reports of the uprooting of trees at several places in the division because of the wind storm.

7,Several flights cancelled after Karachi rain,PK-308 from Karachi to Islamabad also experienced delays,"Due to inclement weather in Karachi, several flights have been cancelled and some have faced delays. A rain emergency has been declared in operational sections, including the Airside Section, by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
According to airport sources, multiple flights were cancelled and experienced delays due to the adverse weather conditions in Karachi on Sunday.
Reportedly, PIA flight 503 from Karachi to Gwadar and the PIA's flight PK 768 from Karachi to Islamabad were cancelled. Private airline flights from Karachi to Lahore and Karachi to Islamabad were also cancelled, as per airport sources.
PK-308 from Karachi to Islamabad also experienced delays, while a flight from Iraq to Karachi could not operate due to tensions between Iran and Israel.
The flight from Karachi to Istanbul faced several hours of delay. The incoming flight from Istanbul to Karachi also faced delays.
According to a spokesperson for the CAA, flight arrivals and departures experienced some delays due to the adverse weather conditions. The spokesperson stated that a rain emergency has been declared in operational sections, including the Airside Section.
Flights are sometimes cancelled during rains or adverse weather conditions in view of safety concerns as rain can reduce visibility, create slippery runways, and affect aircraft performance during takeoff and landing. Safety regulations require airlines to prioritize passenger safety, and if weather conditions pose a risk, flights may be cancelled.
Heavy rain can also significantly reduce visibility for pilots, making it difficult to navigate during takeoff, landing, and taxiing on the runway. In such cases, flights may be delayed or cancelled until visibility improves.
Rain can also affect aircraft performance, particularly during takeoff and landing. Wet runways can increase the distance required for an aircraft to accelerate for takeoff or decelerate upon landing. If runway conditions are unsafe, flights may be cancelled.
Rainy weather can impact airport operations, including ground handling services, baggage handling, and fueling operations. If airport facilities are unable to operate safely in wet conditions, flights may be cancelled.
Adverse weather conditions can also lead to congestion and delays in air traffic control, affecting the scheduling of flights. If air traffic controllers determine that the volume of air traffic exceeds the capacity to manage it safely during rainy weather, flights may be cancelled or delayed.
