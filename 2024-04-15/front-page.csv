• President Joe Biden warns Benjamin Netanyahu to ‘think carefully’ about any escalation
• Tehran says US was informed of ‘limited’ attack on Israel, warns Tel Aviv against reprisals
• ‘Operation Honest Promise’ achieved all its objectives, says Iranian army chief
• Iran to be responsible if US targets, Israel attacked again, UNSC told
WASHINGTON: The United States said on Sunday it will not join any Israeli counterattack on Iran, with President Joe Biden warning Prime Minister Benjamin Netan­yahu to “think carefully” about any escalation.
The White House said Mr Biden did not want a wider war after helping key ally Israel repel a massive aerial attack by Tehran — itself in retaliation for a presumed Israeli strike that killed senior Iranian military officers in Damascus.
“We are not looking for a wider war with Iran,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” adding that the United States does not “want to see this escalate”.
Mr Kirby said Mr Netanyahu was “well aware” of Mr Biden’s feelings after the two leaders spoke on Saturday while Iran’s unprecedented attack was still unfolding.
The assault saw Iran fire more than 300 drones and missiles towards Israel late Saturday, injuring 12 people, the Israeli army said.
US officials said American warplanes had brought down around 70 drones while US ships downed between four and six ballistic missiles.
But a senior Biden administration official confirmed that Mr Biden had told Mr Netanyahu that Washington would not offer military support for any retaliation on Iran.
“We would not be a part of any response they do,” the official told reporters on a call, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We would not envision ourselves participating in such an act,” he said.
“A big question is not only whether, but what Israel might choose to do, and so this is a decision for them,” the Biden administration official said.
Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu spoke at a time of “heightened emotion” and “had a discussion about trying to slow things down”. The US president “made very clear to the prime minister last night that we do have to think carefully and strategically about the risks of escalation”.
Attack ‘foiled’
Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that 99 per cent of the launches had been intercepted, declaring that “the Iranian attack was foiled”.
While 170 drones and 30 cruise missiles were shot down before they reached Israel, a few of the 110 ballistic missiles did get through, Israeli army said.
Among the injured was a seven-year-old girl near the southern Israeli town of Arad who was in intensive care, according to the medical centre that received her. Iran’s proxies and allies also carried out coordinated attacks on Israeli positions.
‘Achieved all objectives’
The Iranian army declared that its attack was “completed successfully,” which it said was in “self-defence”. “Operation Hon-est Promise… achie­ved all its objectives”, said Iranian army chief Mohammad Bagheri.
He said the attack targeted an intelligence centre and the airbase from which Tehran says Israeli F-35 jets took off to strike the Damascus consulate. “Both these centres were significantly destroyed,” he said, though Israel claim the attack only resulted in minor damage.
US told of ‘limited’ attack
Iran’s foreign minister on Sunday said Tehran had informed the United States and gave a 72-hour warning to neighbouring countries of its retaliatory attack on Israel.
“We announced… to the White House in a message that our operations will be limited, minimal and will be aimed at punishing the Israeli regime,” said Hos­sein Amir-Abdollahian.
Iran to be responsible for more attacks, UNSC told
The US said at the UN Security Council on Sunday if Iran attacked US targets or launched further attacks on Israel, it would be held responsible.
Addressing a UNSC meeting called by Israel to review the consequences of the Iranian drone attacks on Israel, US Deputy Permanent Representative Robert Wood said: “Let me be clear, if Iran and its proxies take actions against the United States or further actions against Israel, Iran will be held responsible.”
The US, he said, condemns in the strongest terms the unprecedented attacks on Israel by Iran and its proxies and partners. “Iran’s intent was to cause significant damage and death in Israel. Iran’s reckless actions not only pose a threat to populations in Israel but also to other UN member states in the region, including Jordan and Iraq,” he added.
Ambassador Wood said the UNSC has an obligation to not let Iran’s actions go unanswered. He accused Iran of arming Hezbollah in violation of UNSC resolutions, of arming, facilitating Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and blocking commercial shipping.
He said that in the coming days, the US will explore additional measures to hold Iran accountable at the UN. “More immediately, the Security Council must unequivocally condemn Iran’s aggressive actions and call for Iran and its partners and proxies to cease their attacks,” he added.
The US, he said, also “supports Israel’s inherent right to defend itself in the face of these attacks.”
Tehran’s warning
However, Iran warned Israel and the US of a much larger response if there is any counterattack for its weekend retaliation, as Israel said “the campaign is not over yet”.
President Ebrahim Raisi warned Israel against a “reckless” retaliation, saying one would be a met with “a decisive and much stronger response”. The Iranian army chief also warned, “our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran” and told Washington its bases could also be attacked if it helped Israel retaliate.

1,Up to Rs8.50 hike in fuel prices likely,"Depending on final calculation, petrol price could rise by Rs2.50-Rs2.80 and HSD by Rs8-Rs8.50 per litre.","ISLAMABAD: While the impact of the Middle East escalation is yet to materialise, the higher international market is estimated to push up the prices of petrol and high-speed diesel by about Rs2.50 and Rs8.50 per litre, respectively on Monday (April 15) for the next fortnight, despite a decline in the import premium and a slightly improved exchange rate.
Informed sources said the prices of petrol and HSD had increased in the international market by about $4 and $4.50 per barrel, respectively, during the last fortnight, before the latest escalation. Depending on final calculation, the price of petrol is projected to be higher by Rs2.50 to Rs2.80 and that of HSD to go up by Rs8 to Rs8.50 per litre.
Interestingly, the imp­ort premium on petrol has dropped by almost 21pc to $10.7 per barrel over the last fortnight when compared to $13.50 in last few days of March and the rupee strengthened by about 40 paisa against a dollar to Rs278.20. The net impact is estimated to be about Rs2.80 per litre increase in petrol price from existing rate of Rs289.41.
The HSD price, on the other hand, was up in the international market and its import premium paid by the benchmark Pakistan State Oil remained unchanged at $6.50 per barrel.
HSD rate was thus estimated to be higher by Rs8 to Rs8.50 per litre, subject to final exchange rate adjustment in pricing, from current rate of Rs282.24 per litre at depot stage.
For the purpose of price calculations, officials said the petrol price had gone up by about $4 per barrel to $98.5 last week while HSD price went up by $4.50 per barrel to $102.9.
Almost a fortnight ago, the government had increased the price of petrol by Rs9.66 per litre and reduced that of high speed diesel (HSD) by Rs3.32 per litre for the fortnight ending April 15.
The government has already achieved Rs60 per litre petroleum levy — maximum permissible limit under the law — on both petrol and HSD.
Under the commitments made with the International Monetary Fund, the government had set budget target to collect Rs869bn as petroleum levy on petroleum products during the current fiscal year. It has already collected about Rs475bn in the first half (July-December) of the fiscal, though the government is expected to mop up about Rs970bn by end of the year despite the revised target of Rs920bn by end-June.
At present, the government is charging about Rs82 per litre tax on both petrol and HSD.

2,"Opposition alliance’s ranks swelling, claims PTI","Omar Ayub terms Pishin power show ""very successful""; PPP ticket-holder joins PTI.","QUETTA: PTI leader Omar Ayub said on Sunday that his party was in contact with other political forces to shore up the six-party opposition alliance to strengthen its bid to oust the incumbent government led by the PML-N.
Addressing a press conference in Quetta, Mr Ayub said that political parties, labour organisations and other segments of society would also be contacted in this regard.
“We have already contacted political parties,” he claimed, and added that despite bad weather, the opening public meeting of the grand alliance remained “very successful” in Pishin.
He claimed that the government formed on the basis of ‘Form-47s’ in three provinces and the Centre would not stay for much longer as “they are a product of rigged elections”.

Omar Ayub terms Pishin power show ‘very successful’; PPP ticket-holder joins PTI

He said the alliance of six opposition parties, which had launched the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen Pakis­­tan (TTAP), from Balochistan will be successful in ousting the incumbent government led by the PML-N, with the support of the people who had given their mandate to PTI in the Feb 8 elections.
He claimed that PTI founder Imran Khan had brought political awareness to the people, who pro­ved that by giving vote to the PTI. He said Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi would be released from Adiala jail soon and they would be among the people. He said Balochistan was his native province and that all resources available in the province should be spent on its development.
On Saturday, a coalition of six opposition parties kicked off a nationwide movement for the rule of law from Pishin. PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub Khan had announced the initiative after a late-night sitting that continued till the early hours of Saturday morning.
The movement will not only hold public meetings but also engage bar associations, university students, and other parties to muster up support for the campaign against the PML-N-led coalition government.
Mr Ayub had said that PkMAP chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai was nominated as the alliance’s president with consensus of the leadership of opposition parties at the hours-long meeting, which was presided over by BNP-Mengal chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal.
Also on Sunday, PPP ticket holder Sharif Khan Khilji parted ways with his old party and joined PTI.

3,"One Pakistani killed, another injured in Sydney attack","KARACHI: A Pakistani man was killed and another injured in a weekend knife attack in a Sydney shopping mall,...","KARACHI: A Pakistani man was killed and another injured in a weekend knife attack in a Sydney shopping mall, accor­ding to two local community groups and media reports.
The Australian Pakis­tani National Association and an Ahmadiyya community organisation on Sunday said 30-year-old Faraz Tahir, the mall’s security guard, was killed by a knife-wielding man who also killed five women, AFP reported.
In a post on social media platform X, the Australian high commissioner in Pakistan, Neil Hawkins, said another Pakistani citizen was also injured in the attack.
Australian broadcaster ABC identified the injured man as Taha Umar Khan, who has been hospitalised after the attack.
He suffered knife injuries and was now in stable condition.
In a press release, the Ahmadiyya community in Australia said Faraz settled in Australia after “fleeing persecution in his home country of Pakistan”.
He had only worked a few shifts as a security guard before he was killed, Australian newspaper Sydney Morning Herald reported.
The community’s statement said Faraz was “known for his unwavering dedication and kindness”.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with Faraz’s family and loved ones during this difficult time, as well as with all the other victims and their families affected by this senseless act of violence.”
A community member told Guardian Australia that Tahir did not have family in Australia, and the organisation had been informed of his death by the New South Wales state police.
The Australian Pakistani Nat­ional Association encouraged the community to “stand together in soli­darity, offering support and prayers to those grieving and affe­cted by this heartbreaking loss”.
Scentre Group, which owns and operates the mall where the rampage took place, also paid tribute to the deceased security guard, ABC reported.
The group’s Chief Executive Officer Elliott Rusanow said Faraz died “while trying to protect the community”.
“We are devastated by Faraz’s passing and recognise our team member’s bravery and role as a first responder,” he said.
“Our deepest and heartfelt condolences go out to his family and all who are mourning the loss of loved ones,” Mr Rusanow added.

4,"Dozen more die in heavy rains, lightning","Death toll jumps to 39; homes, infrastructure damaged in Pasni, Kech, Panjgur, Gwadar.","• Death toll jumps to 39
• Homes, infrastructure damaged in Pasni, Kech, Panjgur, Gwadar
• Bilawal insists all signs point to ‘climate change’
QUETTA / GWADAR: Contin­uous heavy rains accompanied by thunderstorms continued to lash several parts of the country, leading to 12 more deaths on Sunday, including six in Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, four in Punjab and two in Balochistan.
This suggests that the recent spate of rains and lightning strikes have killed at least 39 people in the three provinces over the past few days.
In Balochistan, rains continued to lash parts of Makran and various other regions, raising the death toll to 10 in the province after two more people, including a woman, were killed in a lightning strike and a roof collapse incident in Kech district on Sunday.
Officials reported severe damages in coastal towns such as Pasni, Kech, Panjgur districts, and the port city of Gwadar. These damages include heavy losses to houses, infrastructure, and disruptions to transportation networks, including the coastal highway and other link roads, cutting off access to many areas from the provincial capital, Quetta, and other districts.
The power supply has been severely affected, with electric pylons uprooted in Pasni and Panjgur areas, leading to outages lasting hours in Quetta and surrounding areas. Gas supply disruptions and low pressure have also been reported across various areas of the provincial capital and other cities.
Normal life and traffic have been significantly impacted across Makran and other regions of northern, central and southern Balochistan, with incessant rains affecting around 25 districts of the province.
Reports indicated that Pasni, a coastal town in the Gwadar district, has been particularly hard hit, with extensive areas submerged under rainwater.
“Pasni looks like a big lake at the moment as flash floods entered the human settlements and main commercial areas,” Noor Ahmed Kalmati, chairman of Pasni Municipal Committee, told Dawn by phone.
“Dozens of mud houses and boundary walls collapsed in heavy rains that lashed the small town for four hours,” Mr Kalmati said, adding that the municipal committee was trying to rescue residents trapped by floodwaters.
In Kech district, scores of houses have been damaged, and link roads washed away, cutting links to Turbat and other areas of Makran.
Kech Deputy Commissioner Hassan Baloch confirmed the death of a woman due to a lightning strike in the Gohrag Bag area of Bal Nagor and structural collapses, with significant damage to infrastructure, including an under-construction bridge at Buzi Top on the coastal highway. He said another man was killed in the Kech district after the roof of a house collapsed.
Besides, several mud houses were damaged while hundreds of vehicles, including loaded trucks, passenger coaches and other vehicles, were trapped on both sides of Buzi Top.
Panjgur has also suffered extensive damage, with hundreds of solar panels destroyed, disrupting essential services such as communication. The rain has severely impacted life in Quetta, flooding roads, damaging infrastructure and causing difficulties for residents.
Efforts to mitigate the impact, including the city cleaning campaign launched by Quetta Metropolitan Corporation Administrator Hamza Shafqaat, have been hampered by the relentless downpour and subsequent flooding.
Punjab
In Punjab, the lightning-related death toll rose to 21 after four more deaths on Sunday, a spokesperson of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said. The victims include nine men, five women and seven children.
Lightning strikes have occurred in Muzaffargarh, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur, Lodhran, Bahawalpur and Bahawalnagar.
Overall, nine people died due to lightning strikes in Rahim Yar Khan; three each in Baha­walnagar, Bahawalpur and Lodhran; and one each in Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur and Kot Addu.
Moreover, five people were also injured due to lightning, the PDMA spokesperson said.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia has issued instructions to provide the best medical care to the injured. He said financial assistance would be provided to the families of the deceased.
Bilawal blames climate change
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari offered condolences for the loss of lives resulting from multiple accidents amid heavy rains across various regions of the country, notably Punjab, KP and Balochistan, APP reported.
He urged the provincial governments to deploy all available resources to help the rain-affected victims.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari highlighted the surge in lightning incidents nationwide as indicative of climate change, emphasising the imperative role of universities and research institutions in addressing this issue. He underscored the necessity for exceptional spirit and leadership at the government level to shield citizens from climate change impacts.
He stressed that confronting the threats posed by climate change demands substantive action rather than superficial discourse or avoidance.

5,Situationer: Tehran’s move ‘more chess than a show of strength’,Experts say focus should now be on preventing situation from spiralling out of control.,"• FO stops short of naming Israel, urges all parties to demonstrate ‘utmost restraint’
• Experts say focus should now be on preventing situation from spiralling out of control
TEHRAN’S retaliatory strikes against Israel, in response to Tel Aviv’s actions against Iranian interests in Syria — especially the April 1 attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus — were less about inflicting substantial damage on Israel and more about a strategic recalibration, aimed at restoring deterrence, which would have long-lasting implications for regional security.
The strikes, which marked the first such attack since the Yom Kippur War of 1973, elicited a wide range of reactions across the world. Some critics denounced the strikes as an “unnecessary escalation” that risked further destabilising an already tense region. Others questioned the actual effectiveness of the strikes in causing significant devastation.
Meanwhile, there were voices that viewed the strikes as a victory for Iran.
Tehran’s actions were prompted by the attack on its consulate in Damascus, in which seven of its military advisers, including three senior commanders serving in Syria, were killed, marking a major escalation in Israel’s conflict with Iran.
A response from Tehran, which had in Jan 2020 carried out strikes on a US base in Iraq to avenge the killing of IRGC Commander Qassem Soleimani, was always imminent. Israel and its allies knew about that and had since then been preparing to defend against the assault.
Iran too wasn’t very secretive about its plans; Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian disclosed that US and Iran’s neigbours had been notified about the attacks at least 72 hours in advance.
 


Senator Mushahid Hussain, who has led the Senate’s Foreign Affairs and Defence committees in the past, told Dawn: “Iran did the right thing, strictly in accordance with UN Charter Article 51 in self-defence and international law.”
The reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office also contained a reference to the Damascus consulate attack as the trigger for Iranian action against Israel.
“On 2 April 2024, Pakistan had pointed to the dangers of the attack on an Iranian consular office in Syria as a major escalation in an already volatile region,” it noted.
On that occasion, major world powers avoided unequivocally condemning the attack and censuring Israel for its recklessness; the UN Security Council didn’t condemn the Israeli move either after US, Britain and France opposed a condemnation statement drafted by Russia.
The FO reaction highlighted this aspect as well. “Today’s developments demonstrate the consequences of the breakdown of diplomacy. These also underline the grave implications in cases where the UN Security Council is unable to fulfill its responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security,” it said, echoing to some extent Tehran’s assertion that the imperative to retaliate could have been avoided if UNSC had condemned Israeli action.
Some also noted that the statement lacked forcefulness, as it did not explicitly name Israel.
The FO, however, avoided emphasising that Israeli aggression in Gaza was driving instability in the region, something that was pointed out in Beijing’s reaction. Pakistan said the latest episode in the Iran-Israel tensions was “the spillover of the Gaza conflict” and called for the implementation of the UN Security Council resolution demanding a ceasefire there.
“It is now critically urgent to stabilise the situation and restore peace. We call on all parties to exercise utmost restraint and move towards de-escalation,” the official statement said.
How effective were the strikes?
Pakistan’s former envoy to UN, US, and UK, Dr Maleeha Lodhi, told Dawn: “Iran’s retaliatory response was a measured one, aimed not to wreak any destruction, but to send a strong message to Tel Aviv that it had the capability to take such action.”
The orchestrated aerial assault challenged Israel’s sophisticated defence systems, which was described by the US as “unprecedented”. Utilising a combination of drones and missiles, both old and new, Iran launched over 300 projectiles, deploying many as decoys.
Amidst this barrage were inserted hypersonic missiles, some of which are said to have struck the Nevatim Airbase and an intelligence headquarters in Mount Hermon, even a though majority them were intercepted. The airbase and intelligence premises had been identified by Tehran as originating points for the Damascus attack. However, the extent of the damage to these facilities cannot be confirmed yet.
From a military point of view, this operation revealed not only the physical limitations of Israel’s ‘Iron Dome’ missile defence system, but also the extent of reliance on foreign assets for Israel’s security, including US, Jordanian, and British military support, and European radar coverage.
By demonstrating its capability to strike significant Israeli military sites, this show of force would definitely help Tehran rally domestic and regional support, projecting Iran as a capable defender of Muslim interests against Israeli aggressions.
“It also sends an inspiring message to the Palestinians and Muslim masses that there’s at least one country in the Muslim World that doesn’t blink before [the] bullying of Israel,” Senator Mushahid Hussain said.
The repercussions are also political. The apparent prioritisation of Israel’s security by neighboring Arab regimes, as evidenced by their rapid deployment of defensive measures, has potential domestic political costs, particularly in countries like Jordan, where public sentiment may view this as a betrayal of the Palestinian cause.
Potential for escalation
 


The trajectory of the Iran-Israel conflict is fraught with potential for both conflict and restraint. The actions taken by Israel in the coming days, along with the effectiveness of international diplomatic interventions, will be critical in shaping the next phase of this increasingly complex geopolitical theatre.
“This episode has sparked fears of a full-blown regional war. But it is not in the interest of any country other than Israel to escalate the situation. Neither the US nor Iran want to see the region plunge into a wider conflict. That is why Washington is urging restraint on Israel and warned that it will not become part of any Israeli military action,” Dr Lodhi said.
The attention, she hoped, would now shift to diplomatic efforts to prevent the situation from spiralling out of control.
