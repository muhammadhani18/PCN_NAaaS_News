SYDNEY: A small evening vigil was held on Sunday for the six people killed in a knife attack at a busy Sydney shopping centre, which police said was carried out by a local man with a history of mental illness.
As night fell Sunday, a group of about 40 people from a local Muslim association placed flowers on the ever-growing pile outside the shopping centre.
They stood for a minute of silence with their hands clasped, heads bowed, and eyes fixated on the flowers as they remembered Tahir, who was killed on his job.
The mourners then raised their hands in a moment of prayer. Many wiped away tears.

Police say knife attacker was a local man ‘with a history of mental illness’

Police said the attack lasted for about half an hour until a solo police woman tracked down Cauchi and shot him dead.
Inspector Amy Scott was hailed by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as a “hero” who “no doubt” had “saved lives through her action”.
Among Cauchi’s victims were a designer, a volunteer surf lifesaver, the daughter of an entrepreneur, and a new mother whose nine-month-old baby is still in hospital with serious stab wounds.
As the attack unfolded on Saturday, online social media accounts falsely reported that the attack was linked to ideological or religious groups or events in the Middle East.
Police have named the assailant as 40-year-old itinerant man Joel Cauchi, who was previously diagnosed with a mental health issue.
New South Wales police Assistant Commissioner Anthony Cooke said there was no evidence to suggest Cauchi was “driven by any particular motivation, ideology or otherwise”.
Police said he was diagnosed with a mental health issue at age 17.
‘Only doing her job’
In a statement, Cauchi’s parents offered thoughts for the victims and said their son’s actions were “truly horrific”.
“We are still trying to comprehend what has happened. He has battled with mental health issues since he was a teenager.”
The parents also sent a message to the officer who shot their son dead.
“She was only doing her job to protect others, and we hope she is coping alright,” they said.
Cauchi is believed to have travelled to Sydney about a month ago and hired a small storage unit in the city, according to police. It contained personal belongings, including a boogie board.
He had been living in a vehicle and hostels and was only in sporadic contact with his family via text messages, his parents said.
A Facebook profile said Cauchi came from Toowoomba, near Brisbane, and had attended a local high school and university.
A distinctive grey, red and yellow dragon tattoo on his right arm was used to help identify him.
Australians, largely unaccustomed to violent crime, are still coming to terms with an attack that shattered a city better known for its famed beaches and laid-back bars and restaurants.
‘Outstanding human’
One victim, 38-year-old mother Ashlee Good, succumbed to her injuries after desperately passing her bleeding baby to two strangers in the hope they could save the child’s life.
Good’s family described her as “a beautiful mother, daughter, sister, partner, friend, all round outstanding human and so much more”.
“To the two men who held and cared for our baby when Ashlee could not — words cannot express our gratitude”, they said in a statement to Australian media.
The baby, named Harriet, was said to be recovering well after lengthy surgery.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australians were struggling to understand an “unspeakable” attack that is “really just beyond comprehension”.
“We also know there are many people still in hospital dealing with recovery, and our thoughts and prayers are with them,” Albanese said he had received messages from US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, among others.
Flags across Australia will be flown at half-mast on Monday to honour the victims of the Bondi Junction stabbing, as per Sydney Morning Herald.

1,"Stalled Gaza talks — Hamas, Israel exchange recriminations",Palestinian group insists on permanent ceasefire with full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.,"

JERUSALEM: Israel and Hamas have accused each other of undermining negotiations for a truce in Gaza and a hostage release deal, although the talks have not collapsed.
While Hamas-backer Iran was preparing to launch hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for a deadly Damascus strike, the Palestinian group announced on Saturday that it had delivered its response to the latest ceasefire proposal. Without explicitly rejecting the draft deal, Hamas reiterated its longstanding demands for a permanent ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, which Israeli officials have repeatedly opposed.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instead reiterated his determination to launch a ground invasion of Rafah, the last city in Gaza yet to face such a fate and which Israel insists is Hamas’s last major holdout, despite strong opposition from the United States.
Netanyahu accused Hamas of being the “only obstacle” to a deal that would free the Israeli prisoners. “The cabinet and the security forces are united in their opposition to these unfounded demands,” he said, adding that Hamas “has refused any deal and any compromise proposal”.

Palestinian group insists on permanent ceasefire with full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza; Mossad says Hamas does not want a humanitarian deal or prisoner swap

On Sunday, Israel’s Mossad spy agency said in a statement released by Netanyahu’s office that Hamas had rejected the proposal, and said it “proves” that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar “does not want a humanitarian deal” and the return of prisoners.
Sinwar was “continuing to exploit the tension with Iran”, Mossad said, and was aiming for “a general escalation in the region”.
The comments came just hours before Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel, the vast majority of which intercepted according to Israel.
‘Not at a standstill’
Mossad said Israel would “continue to work to achieve the objectives of the war against Hamas with all its might, and will turn every stone to bring back the hostages from Gaza”.
Despite the apparent gulf between the two sides, the talks, mediated by Egypt, the United States and Qatar, are ongoing in the Egyptian capital.
“The negotiations are not at a standstill” but the mediators will have to go back to the drawing board, said Hasni Abidi of CERMAM, a Geneva-based think tank specialising in the Mediterranean and the Arab world.
A framework being circulated in Cairo would halt fighting for six weeks and see the prisoner exchange, as well as more aid deliveries into the besieged Gaza Strip.
A Hamas source told AFP that, ultimately, later stages of the ceasefire would see all prisoners released, Israel withdrawing all its forces from Gaza, the lifting of the siege and the reconstruction of the territory.
However, so far every attempt to negotiate a durable ceasefire in the six-month-long war has failed.
In November, a seven-day truce enabled the exchange of 80 Israeli prisoners for 240 Palestinian prisoners, as well as 25 captives freed outside of the truce mechanism.
The Israeli attacks on Gaza escalated after Hamas’s deadly raid on southern Israel, which resulted in the killing of 1,170 Israeli settlers and military personnel on October 7, 2023. Since then, Israeli forces have killed at least 33,729 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
The Hamas fighters also held around 250 prisoners, 129 of whom remained in Gaza, including 34 that the Israeli army says are dead.
Earlier this month, Israel withdrew most of its troops from the Gaza Strip, leaving only a single brigade in central Gaza, while continuing to launch air strikes and bombardments. However, Netanyahu has repeated his determination to launch a ground invasion of Rafah, where around 1.5 million Gazans are sheltering, despite opposition from Israel’s top ally the United States.
The Israeli premier also faces increasing pressure from the settlers and the families of the prisoners, with weekly demonstrations in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem demanding an end to his government.

2,Genetic engineer gets ‘Oscars of Science’ prize for cancer treatment,His work has helped develop a new form of therapy called CAR-T that has shown exceptional efficacy against certain blood cancers.," 

Michel Sadelain

LOS ANGELES: French-Canadian scientist Michel Sadelain was awarded an “Oscars of Science” prize in Los Angeles on Saturday for his research into genetically modifying immune cells to fight cancer.
The genetic engineer was awarded the Break­through Prize at a glitzy ceremony attended by tech giants such as Elon Musk and Bill Gates, and an array of celebrities including Jessica Chastain, Robert Downey Jr. and Bradley Cooper, on Saturday. His work has helped develop a new form of therapy called CAR-T that has shown exceptional efficacy against certain blood cancers.
“This prize is an extraordinary recognition,” Sadelain said on the red carpet at the Oscars Museum. “It’s all the more of an honor because … my scientific colleagues told me for a long time that it would never work.”
Launched in 2010, the Breakthrough Prize awards “the world’s most brilliant minds” in fields including life sciences, fundamental physics and mathematics, styling itself as the Silicon Valley-backed answer to the Nobels. Dubbed the “Oscars for Science”, founding sponsors include Sergey Brin, Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg.
Sadelain will split the $3 million prize money with American immunologist Carl June, who also led groundbreaking research into the field independently of his co-winner.
Sadelain developed a way to use a disabled virus to genetically reprogram human T-cells, so that they grew claw-like structures called antigen receptors, allowing the T-cells to target specific cancer cells.

3,Somali Pirates free ship and crew after ransom ‘air-dropped’,"Bangladesh-flagged vessel was transporting over 55,000 tonnes of coal from Maputo to the UAE when captured.","CHITTAGONG: Somali pirates freed a Bangladesh-flagged cargo vessel and its 23 crew on Sunday after sackloads of US dollars were air-dropped to them in ransom, the company and relatives said.
The bulk carrier MV Abdullah was transporting more than 55,000 tonnes of coal from Maputo to the United Arab Emirates when it was seized by dozens of pirates around 550 nautical miles (1,000kms) off the Somali coast a month ago.
The seizure came amid a surge in Somali pirate activity, with international naval forces diverted from the Gulf of Aden into the Red Sea to guard against attacks on shipping by Yemen’s Houthi fighters.
Negotiations for the ship’s release were led by Meherul Karim, CEO of its owners KSRM.

Bangladesh-flagged vessel was transporting over 55,000 tonnes of coal from Maputo to the UAE when captured

“The pirates called us when they reached near the Somalia coast” and one of them spoke English, he told reporters in Chittagong on Sunday. “He communicated with us till we finalised the negotiation,” he added. “We will not discuss or reveal the amount of ransom money.” Footage had been provided to show all the crew were safe, and early on Sunday around 65 pirates left the ship on nine boats, he said.
The MV Abdullah was on its way to its original destination escorted by two European Union ships, he said, and the pirates had given the crew a letter of safe passage in Somali promising “the ship would not come under any more attacks by pirates until it reached Dubai port”.
Fahmida Akter Anny, wife of the ship’s master Mohammed Abdur Rashid, said her husband told her an airplane dropped three sacks filled with US dollars to the pirates before circling the vessel three times.
“After receiving the money, they released all crew,” she said. “My husband was happy.” The vessel’s capture came after the first successful case of Somali piracy since 2017 was recorded in December.
A series of incidents since then has fuelled concerns about a resurgence of Indian Ocean raids by opportunistic pirates exploiting a security gap after the redeployment of international forces.
Houthis of Yemen have launched scores of attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden targeting Israeli-linked vessels in response to Israel’s war against Palestinians in Gaza.
Naval forces — including from India, Sri Lanka and the Seychelles — have since freed fishing boats seized by gunmen and thwarted other attempted attacks.
Last month, Indian commandos boarded and recaptured the vessel seized in December, the Maltese-flagged MV Ruen, around 260 nautical miles (480kms) off the Somali coast. All 17 hostages were rescued and 35 alleged pirates were brought to Mumbai to face prosecution.
Analysts say that the Somali pirate threat remains well below its 2011 peak, when gunmen launched attacks as far as 3,655kms from the Somali coast in the Indian Ocean.

4,"Heavy rain, flash floods kill 33 in Afghanistan",Twenty of 34 provinces lashed by heavy showers,"KABUL: At least 33 people have been killed over three days of heavy rains and flash flooding in Afghanistan, the government’s disaster management department said on Sunday.
“From Friday onward, because of the rains there were flash floods which caused high human and financial losses,” department spokesman Janan Sayeq said.
“The primary information shows that, unfortunately, in the floods, 33 people were martyred and 27 people got injured.”
Most casualties were from roof collapses while some 600 houses were damaged or destroyed, nearly 600kms of road demolished, and around 2,000 acres of farmland “flooded away”, Sayeq said.

Twenty of 34 provinces lashed by heavy showers

Some 20 of the nation’s 34 provinces were lashed by the heavy rains, which have followed an unusually dry winter season that has parched terrain and forced farmers to delay planting. At least 25 people were killed in a landslide after massive snowfall in eastern Afghanistan in February, whilst around 60 were killed in a three-week spate of precipitation ending in March.
The United Nations last year warned “Afghanistan is experiencing major swings in extreme weather conditions”.
Scientists say harsh weather patterns are being spurred by climate change and after being ravaged by four decades of war Afghanistan ranks among the nations least prepared to face the phenomenon.
Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021 the flow of foreign aid into the impoverished country has drastically diminished, hindering relief responses to natural disasters.

5,"Modi promises jobs, common civil code if elected again",BJP unveils 76-page manifesto days before it goes to polls in India,"NEW DELHI: Seeking to address key voter concerns ahead of next week’s elections, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised on Sunday to create jobs and a new common civil code for the country if it wins a third term.
The general election, which begins on April 19, will be held in seven stages until June 1. Votes are due to be counted on June 4 and results expected the same day.
The BJP launched its 76-page manifesto on Sunday, wading into a polarising debate by reaffirming its stand on a uniform civil code (UCC), which would standardise laws for personal matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance across faiths and religious communities.
Many communities, particularly Muslims, fear a UCC would encroach on their religious laws and see it as an attack on their identity and against India’s secular constitution.

BJP unveils 76-page manifesto days before it goes to polls in India

The manifesto did not refer to either Hinduism or Islam by name, but the BJP pitched to Muslim women voters by pointing out it had protected them from the “barbaric” practice of “instant divorce”. The manifesto stated the party “believes that there cannot be gender equality till such time Bharat adopts a uniform civil code, which protects the rights of all women”.
Surveys, however, suggest unemployment, inflation and rural distress remain issues of concern in the world’s most populous country despite its strong economy, and addressing these will be Modi’s biggest challenge.
“Our focus is on dignity of life ... on quality of life, our focus is also on creating jobs through investment,” Modi said after releasing the manifesto, titled Modi’s Guarantee, at the party headquarters in the capital.
Modi insisted that the manifesto was focused on creating jobs in sectors such as infrastructure, aviation, railways, electric vehicles, green energy, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, among others, in a bid to address discontent at unemployment levels that are rising despite strong economic growth.
“India’s youth will not have even imagined the number of opportunities that will come their way,” he told cheering BJP members, including top federal ministers who sat in the audience wearing stoles featuring the BJP’s lotus symbol.
‘Empty promises’
Congress, the main opposition party, which has been struggling to revive its fortunes, said it was not impressed by a manifesto that is filled with “empty promises”.
“Today, people want to ask what happened in the last 10 years,” Congress lawmaker Manish Tewari said. “Unemployment is rampant and inflation has broken the back of common people. The people of the country will hold him (Modi) to account for what’s happened in the last 10 years.”
Modi also vowed to expand welfare programmes, including bringing all Indians above the age of 70 under an existing free health insurance programme and pushing piped cooking gas connections to all houses to follow up on a subsidised cooking gas cylinder programme launched in 2016.
Other BJP promises include raising the cap on loans for non-farming small and micro borrowers, offering free housing for another 30 million poor and keeping up a free grains programme for 800 million Indians until 2029.
The manifesto said the BJP government would continue to focus on a path of low inflation and fiscal prudence to achieve high economic growth.
“The ambition of the 1.4 billion people of the country is my mission,” Modi said. “I am placing this manifesto before the people to seek their blessings. Please bless us ... to increase our strength ... implement this manifesto and ensure a developed India.”
Unemployment was the primary concern of 27pc of the 10,000 voters surveyed by Lokniti-CSDS across 19 of India’s 28 states, with rising prices coming second at 23pc, the Hindu newspaper reported last week.
The unemployment rate rose to 5.4pc in 2022-23, from 4.9pc in 2013-14 just before Modi swept to power, and nearly 16pc of urban youth in the 15-29 years age group remained unemployed in 2022-23 due to poor skills and a lack of quality jobs, official data shows.
“BJP does not even want to discuss the most important issues related to people’s lives, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi posted on X. “This time the youth is not going to fall into Modis trap, now they will strengthen the hands of Congress and bring an ‘employment revolution’ in the country.”
