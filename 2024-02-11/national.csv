0,PDM economic management led to sharp rise in per capita debt,A year under coalition govt triggered 25% surge in per capita debt,"A new legally mandated fiscal policy statement has revealed the worst economic management by the coalition government of the Pakistan Democratic Movement, resulting in expenditures over Rs2.2 trillion higher than budgeted and a 25% increase in the debt burden for every citizen.
The Ministry of Finance’s Fiscal Policy Statement 2024 showed a sharp rise in the debt burden during the fiscal year 2022-23, the period when PDM ruled Pakistan. The debt burden of every citizen increased by 25.2% to Rs271,624 by the end of the previous fiscal year. In absolute terms, every person’s debt burden rose by Rs54,500 within one year, according to the statement. A year ago, the per person debt burden was Rs216,925, according to the Ministry of Finance report. The statement is prepared under the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act (FRDL) and will be placed before the new National Assembly. Although the Ministry of Finance has not officially released the statement, the deadline to present it was January 31st.
The gross public debt jumped to Rs62.9 trillion by June 2023, indicating an increase since then. A more than one-fourth increase in per capita debt in one year signifies the speed at which the country is sinking under the debt burden.
The report stated that the key factors responsible for this rise are interest payments on debt and the exchange rate devaluation effect.
The Ministry of Finance has calculated the per capita debt based on the assumption of a population of 231.5 million people. If the new population census numbers are considered, then the per person debt burden would be Rs260,387, up by Rs44,462 or 21%.
Pakistan was ruled by the PDM from April 2022 to August 2023—an alliance of about a dozen political parties. The large alliance made economic decision-making difficult, and these parties fought hard for thinning fiscal resources. A large and unsustainable Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) was also the result of the political demands of the alliance partners. The February 8th elections have resulted in a hung National Assembly, and the two largest PDM partners—the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)—began negotiations on Friday to form a coalition government.
The Fiscal Policy Statement reflects the challenging economic landscape faced during the fiscal year 2023, marked by significant natural disasters, particularly unprecedented floods that wreaked havoc on the country, according to the finance ministry. The economic repercussions of these floods were extensive, causing a negative impact on growth, displacing millions, and leading to substantial economic losses, it added. However, the policy statement showed that the fiscal slippages mostly occurred in areas unrelated to the floods and were more about imprudent economic management and wrong budgeting.

The previous coalition government missed last fiscal year’s annual budget deficit target of Rs4.54 trillion, and the actual deficit came in at Rs6.7 trillion, a record deficit in a fiscal year. In terms of the size of the economy, the total fiscal deficit was equal to 7.9% of GDP, whereas the primary deficit remained at 1%.
The details showed that the fiscal slippages were mainly on account of higher interest payments and higher subsidies—two areas that reveal poor budgeting and slack fiscal controls.
The federal expenditure increased to Rs11.3 trillion as against the budget estimates of Rs9.3 trillion—a slippage of Rs2 trillion or 21.5%, according to the report.
The rise in current expenditures was largely driven by mark-up payments which remained at Rs5.7 trillion—a slippage of Rs1.75 trillion. The finance ministry stated that the sharp increase in interest rates contributed to this rise in current expenditures that may also remain high during the current fiscal year.
It has become the habit of the finance ministry to deliberately understate the interest expenditures every year despite internal projections suggesting higher spending during the budget-making exercise. For the current fiscal year too, the Ministry of Finance’s allocation of Rs7.3 trillion is understated by around Rs1.2 trillion. The finance ministry report stated that the total current expenditures remained at 123.5% of the budget estimates in fiscal year 2023.
The report further stated that the budget estimates of subsidies for the last fiscal year were Rs664 billion. “However, the actual expenditures for the provision of subsidies remained at Rs1.08 trillion,” the report added.
The net revenue receipts of the federal government remained at Rs4.7 trillion—a trillion rupee less than the interest cost that the federal government paid in the previous fiscal year. After the transfer of resources to provinces, Net Federal Revenue receipts were Rs4.7 trillion against the budget estimate of Rs5 trillion.
The pension-related federal expenses were equal to 109% of the budget estimates, and defence expenditures were almost within the budgeted allocations. During the last fiscal year, actual development expenditures of Rs890.3 billion remained slightly above the budget estimates of Rs871 billion.
The PDM government also violated the FRDL Act on two counts—bringing the public debt to 57.5% of the GDP and containing the budget deficit below 3.5% of the GDP.

1,Apple to settle lawsuit with tech startup,Agreement allows Apple to examine Rivos’ systems and recover any confidential information,"Apple plans to settle a lawsuit that accused tech startup Rivos of stealing its trade secrets related to computer chip technology, according to a joint court filing on Friday in California federal court.
The companies told the US District Court for the Northern District of California that they had “signed an agreement that potentially settles the case,” and that the agreement allows Apple to examine Rivos’ systems and recover any confidential information.
Representatives for Apple and Rivos did not immediately respond to requests for comment and more information about the settlement.
Apple sued “stealth” startup Rivos in 2022. It said Mountain View, California-based Rivos had hired away dozens of its engineers and used its confidential information to develop competing “system-on-chip” (SoC) technology. SoCs are integrated circuits with several computer components in a single chip, including central processing units and graphic processing units.

2,Challenges abound for new govt,"Upcoming govt may opt for old solutions, avoid politically tough decisions","Pakistan’s long overdue economic reforms and privatisation programme may become more challenging in the face of the potential installation of a coalition government as no political party has won a clear majority in Thursday’s general elections.
The new administration is expected to opt for old solutions that have already been tested in the past 30 to 40 years. In one of the easiest measures, it will increase energy prices instead of undertaking politically tough energy reforms. Consequently, the inflation rate will continue to remain elevated. According to experts, Pakistani rupee is expected to stay stable against the US dollar and other major currencies in the short run. However, the stock market and Eurobonds may come under pressure in the backdrop of heightened political uncertainty as it is unclear who will form the next government.
Talking to The Express Tribune, independent analyst Adnan Agar was of the view that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had an economic team unlike Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).
However, the PML-N’s earlier finance minister Ishaq Dar had a “hostile relationship” with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he recalled, adding that Dar would continue to pursue his old policies of keeping the rupee-dollar parity under control and flouting conditions of a new loan programme.
“Whoever forms the government will approach the IMF for entering into a new programme after getting the last tranche of $1.1 billion under the ongoing standby arrangement to achieve economic stability and growth and continue to repay foreign debt without any interruption,” he said.
Agar emphasised the dire need for Pakistan to adopt tax reforms like taxing the agriculture and real estate sectors to increase revenue collection and say goodbye to the IMF forever. However, he raised a question “how can the elite (in the government) tax themselves”.
They would further increase electricity and gas prices to address the circular debt issue instead of tackling line losses and energy theft. They may continue to tax businesses already reeling from high levies instead of going after the rich, said Agar, who is also Director Research at AA Gold Commodities.
Chase Securities Director Research Yousuf M Farooq said Pakistan could not afford another political uncertainty at a crucial time when it needed a strong leadership to get the economy out of crisis.
“Pakistan’s stock market and Eurobonds will remain volatile if political temperatures do not come down by Sunday night,” he said.
He pointed out that the PPP had a history of supporting economic reforms and it would continue to do so in future as well. However, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has openly opposed privatisation of state-owned entities, he said, but added that the privatisation programme may remain on track under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) platform.

Read Structural reforms inevitable to cope with economic challenges: PM
Farooq projected that inflation would decelerate from February onwards, providing room for a reduction in the central bank’s policy rate, which would gradually prop up business and economic activities.
Treasury firm Tresmark said in a commentary that while the business community was anxious about the split mandate and political uncertainty, “currency traders see the rupee remaining range bound in the next 15 days”.
“As forward premiums are attractive, we will also see more forward selling by exporters, but all in the 15 to 60-day tenors.”
With elections now over, the market is expecting more bilateral and multilateral financing to trickle in and the third IMF review to conclude with loan tranche disbursement after some potential hiccups.
“Having said this, (rupee) upside is also limited and any appreciation above the 276 level will start hurting country’s exports,” Tresmark said.
Talking to Bloomberg TV, former SBP governor Reza Baqir said the other day that securing a new IMF loan programme and controlling inflation would remain the two key challenges for the new government.
Pakistan has significant economic challenges, one of them is how sustainable is its debt. Pakistan does not have access to capital markets (to raise new financing through Eurobonds) and one of the key priorities for any new government is going to be how to restore confidence in its economy, he said.
“I think the number one challenge is going to be how to put the economy on a sustainable footing and how to manage its relationship with the IMF,” Baqir said.
“The first goal is going to be how does Pakistan make a more equitable tax system? How does it bring into the tax net people and privileged classes, who have avoided taxes instead of continuing to squeeze those in the middle class and the salary-earning people? How Pakistan can broaden its base?”

3,Poultry industry sees 40% decline,Reduction in industry due to ill-planned strategies,"The poultry industry, facing multiple challenges, including high volatility in price manipulation following feed mills in the country, has witnessed a downfall instead of growth, with an overall 40% reduction in the industry due to ill-planned strategies.
Industry pundits attribute this decline to the ill-planned and mismanaged broiler breeding sector, lack of ideal husbandry practices, unhygienic conditions, poor bio-security, quarantines, return on investment (ROI), and risky feed transactions based on credit, among other factors. They highlight the sector’s volatility, where chicken meat prices often fluctuate from Rs550 per kilogram (kg) to Rs250 per kg for various reasons, occasionally shooting up due to a poor mechanism of demand and supply in the local market.
In discussions with The Express Tribune, they note that the poultry industry has faced challenges for over six years, with the industry’s growth rate of 7% to 8% annually reduced by 40%. The feed industry has shrunk to hardly 5.5 or 6.5 million tonnes per year compared to the 9 or 9.5 million tonnes produced six years ago.
Hi-Tech Group of Companies CEO, Dr Muhammad Arshad, believes that tuning the return on investment (ROI) logically will lead the industry to reinvest at least 50% of its profit in the commercial broiler rearing sector, regaining expansion at 6% to 8%, as it used to be when feed profits on listed feed rates were 8% to 10%.

Read Poultry prices go up by 30pc
“The poultry industry has been facing a shrinking phase, with one of the main reasons being the infeasible prices of feeds, making it a more capital-intensive industry. Feeds are sold on credit basis, mostly risky transactions where defaults occur frequently. Feed mills practically function as banks, with raw material suppliers as depositors and customers as borrowers. If banks do not charge adequate markup [the feed industry does not earn reasonable profits], they become incapable of extending more loans. Furthermore, if borrowers [feed buyers] do not pay back on time, the bank’s investment is further scaled down,” he explains.
As the feed industry is not earning reasonable profits, they lack the financial capacity to offer more credit to customers, sharply decreasing the industry’s volume. Dr Arshad points out that a few years ago, when the industry was growing, profits of 8% to 10% were being earned on listed feed prices, whereas these gains are now only around 3%.
“This is an integrated system run by the entire poultry industry, including feed mills, poultry farms, volatile rates of broilers, and others. Aside from demand and supply, the government manipulates poultry rates to set or develop a political narrative in the short term, impacting the industry in the long term. During Ramazan, the government reduces prices, taking a heavy toll on small shed farmers. This system is luck-dependent; once the weather is cold, birds catch some infected diseases, and rates fall, the entire chain of the industry or system has to face major losses,” says Salva Feed Mills Private Limited Okara Director, Mohammad Usman Ghani.
He notes that poultry demand significantly slumps ahead of Eidul Azha when mutton and beef are in demand, impacting lacklustre sales across each section of the industry. Ghani stresses that this is a vulnerable sector requiring government support, suggesting incentives for exports, opening Letters of Credit (LCs) for importing necessary ingredients of chicken feed, and stopping the manipulation of rates in the broiler market, which significantly matters.

4,Farmers pile pressure on EU agri-head,"Protest EU measures that place constraints on them, rising costs","Polish politicians called on the EU commissioner for agriculture to quit on Friday as farmers blocked roads across his home country Poland and at border crossings with Ukraine, kicking off a month-long general strike to protest against EU policies.
Farmers in France, Belgium, Portugal, Greece, Spain and Germany have also been protesting against constraints placed on them by EU measures to tackle climate change, as well as rising costs and what they say is unfair competition from abroad.
Polish farmers are angry about the impact of cheap food imports from neighbouring Ukraine and what they say is the “passivity” of their government. EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski came under fire from all sides.
“There is a man in Europe who united all European and Polish farmers against the reform he proposed. This is Janusz Wojciechowski. Resign!” said Deputy Prime Minister Wladysław Kosiniak-Kamysz.

Read Spain’s paella rice could ‘disappear’
Wojciechowski was also criticised by the leader of the former ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party that proposed him for the position. Jarosław Kaczynski said he would call the commissioner to ask him to quit.
Wojciechowski told private broadcaster Polsat News that he had not answered or looked at his telephone, adding that he would make a statement on his future in a few days, probably on Thursday.
He defended his record, saying that he was the only commissioner to have opposed imports from Ukraine.
About 100 farmers and 50 cars blocked the approach to Medyka border crossing, blocking traffic for all vehicles, Ukrainian border service spokesman Andriy Demchenko said on television.
The Ukrainian border service also said that traffic flow had been disrupted at two other crossings.
Elsewhere in central Europe, a farmers’ protest was taking place at the Zahony crossing on the border between Hungary and Ukraine.

5,Election fever influences trading at PSX,"KSE-100 index loses 59 points, or 0.09% WoW, closes at 62,943.75","Pakistan’s stock market traded in a narrow band in a shortened week where investor interest was driven by both hope and uncertainty about general elections, resulting in the KSE-100 index losing some ground by the end of the week.
Among other factors influencing market’s behaviour was the T-bills auction during which the government borrowed significantly less than the targeted amount but their yields came down. Also, the State Bank’s foreign exchange reserves fell $173 million while the Pakistani rupee remained largely stable.
At the beginning of the week on Tuesday, after a day’s closure on account of Kashmir Solidarity Day, the index experienced a notable surge in an earnings season rally, fuelled by expectations of approval of proposals by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to resolve the circular debt crisis and address power tariff concerns. Investor optimism grew over S&P Global’s hint at a potential ratings upgrade for Pakistan, depending on collaboration with financial institutions for securing a new IMF deal.
The bourse succeeded on Wednesday in maintaining its positive momentum as investors appeared optimistic about the economic and political scenario after general elections. However, the index faced increased volatility despite expectations of ratings upgrade post-elections on the back of a new economic roadmap.
Following Thursday’s closure for general elections, the stock market was rattled on Friday by the delay in poll results and growing political uncertainty, which led to a plunge of 1,200 points and deterred investors from building their portfolios.
Overall, the benchmark KSE-100 index fell just 59 points, or 0.09% week-on-week (WoW), at 62,943.75.
JS Global analyst Shagufta Irshad, in her review, noted that average traded volumes dropped 2% WoW to 306 million shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) while traded value increased 22% in dollar terms.
“The benchmark index opened with a decline of over 2,000 points on Friday, being the first trading session post-elections, over lack of clarity about the potential political landscape,” she said. However, the market recovered 2% of the loss by the end of the session as more official results were announced by the Election Commission.

In other news, S&P hinted at upgrading Pakistan’s sovereign rating to “B” from “CCC+” once political stability emerged after elections. On the macro front, in T-bills auction during the week, the cut-off yields decreased 32, 76 and 70 basis points for three, six and 12-month papers.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Bureau of Statistics announced that trade deficit narrowed 33% year-on-year for 7MFY24 with the tally reaching $13.2 billion. In other news, the government sought approval of the IMF for the settlement of Rs1.2 trillion in circular debt and a cabinet committee approved the restructuring of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) for its privatisation, the JS analyst added. Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported that in a three-day week, the PSX exhibited range-bound behaviour.
“Market sentiment was predominantly influenced by election-related developments. On the last day of the week, the market showed signs of pressure due to delay in announcement of polling results, sparking uncertainty among investors,” it said.
In Tuesday’s T-bills auction, the State Bank raised Rs64 billion against the target of Rs480 billion. Its forex reserves saw a trimming of $172 million to $8.04 billion. The rupee closed at Rs279.28 against the US dollar, strengthening Rs0.13, or 0.05% WoW.
Sector-wise negative contribution came from fertiliser (60 points), technology and communication (45 points), food and personal care products (24 points), oil and gas marketing companies (15 points) and textile composite (14 points). Positive contributors were power generation and distribution (54 points), miscellaneous (40 points), commercial banks (21 points), and oil and gas exploration companies (15 points).
Foreign buying was witnessed during the week, which came in at $5.7 million compared to net selling of $9.7 million last week, AHL added.

6,Moody’s downgrades Israel’s rating on war risks,"Country’s rating was cut to “A2”, five notches above investment grade","Moody’s downgraded Israel’s credit rating on Friday, citing material political and fiscal risks for the country from its war with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.
The impact of the conflict raises political risk and weakens Israel’s executive and legislative institutions, and its fiscal strength for the foreseeable future, said Moody’s, which had begun the review for a downgrade on Oct 19.
The country’s rating was cut to “A2”, which is five notches above investment grade, while its credit outlook was kept at negative by Moody’s, meaning a further downgrade is possible.
The war between Israel and Hamas, which has raged since Oct 7, is the latest in a conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that has rumbled on for seven decades and destabilised the Middle East.
“While fighting in Gaza may diminish in intensity or pause, there is currently no agreement to end the hostilities durably and no agreement on a longer-term plan that would fully restore and eventually strengthen security for Israel,” Moody’s said in a statement, on Friday.
The agency expects Israel’s debt burden to be “materially higher” than projected before the conflict and defence spending to be nearly double the level of 2022 by the end of this year in its baseline scenario. Israel has carried out an air and land offensive on the Gaza coastal strip after Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took 253 hostages.

Read Fitch, Moody’s warn of economic risks
Gaza’s health ministry says at least 27,585 Palestinians have been confirmed killed, with thousands more feared buried under rubble.
There has been one truce to date, lasting a week at the end of November.
“While there are currently negotiations underway to secure the release of the hostages against a temporary ceasefire and more humanitarian aid into Gaza, there is no clarity on the likelihood, time frame and durability of such an agreement,” Moody’s said.
Israeli forces geared up on Friday for a ground assault on Hamas in the southern Gaza city of Rafah after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier rejected Hamas’ latest offer for a ceasefire and return of hostages held in the Gaza Strip.
More than a million people driven southwards by Israeli bombing of Gaza are packed into Rafah and surrounding areas. US President Joe Biden has called Israel’s response to the Hamas attacks “over the top”, and the United Nations has said Palestinian civilians in Rafah needed to be protected.

7,S&P 500 earnings growth seen at 9%,It is almost double Jan 1 forecast for 4.7% growth,"With results in from about two-thirds of companies, fourth-quarter 2023 S&P 500, tab earnings growth is now seen at 9.0%, almost double a Jan 1 forecast for 4.7% growth, according to LSEG data on Friday.
About 81% of reports are beating analysts’ expectations, compared with an average of 76% in the previous four reporting periods, the data showed.
“A lot of the surprises were in the earnings,” rather than in revenues, said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “So that simply means expanding margins,” he said. “There are a lot of headlines about companies reducing workforce. It’s companies wanting to be leaner and meaner.” The opening up of the supply chain also has helped companies, he said.

So far for the fourth quarter of 2023, 63.6% of reports are beating analyst revenue expectations, compared with an average of 66% over the past four reporting periods, based on LSEG data.
Revenue growth of 3.4% is now expected for S&P 500 companies in the fourth quarter over a year earlier. That is up slightly from a Jan 1 forecast for 2.6% growth, the data showed.
Paramount Global, CEO Bob Bakish on Jan 25 outlined the company’s strategic priorities, including that the company will continue to reduce its workforce globally.

8,Govt considers allowing urea price hike,"Proposes increase up to Rs358 per bag, farmers face increased import burden","The government is considering permitting fertiliser manufacturers to increase urea prices by up to Rs358 per bag, shifting the entire burden of over Rs30 billion in imports onto farmers. As part of the plan, manufacturers have been granted the basket price of imported and locally manufactured urea to pass on the full burden of Rs220,000 imported urea to farmers.
Agritech, a prominent player in the industry, has proposed a hike in its Maximum Retail Price (MRP) from Rs3,936 per bag to Rs4,095 per bag, indicating an increase of Rs159 per bag. Similarly, Engro and Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC) have proposed an increase in price per bag to Rs3,766, up from the existing Rs3,595, reflecting an increase of Rs171 per bag. Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited (FFBL) may see a more significant leap, with a proposed price of Rs4,339 per bag, compared to the current Rs3,981 per bag. This substantial increase of Rs358 per bag is poised to have widespread implications in the agricultural sector.
Furthermore, the Fatima Group has proposed varying increases for its products. Fatima (SDO - Single Drum Oven) is set to witness a hike from Rs3,671 per bag to Rs3,839 per bag, reflecting an increase of Rs168 per bag. Likewise, both Pak Arab and Fatima (SHP - Sulphate of Potash) have proposed increases in their MRPs, each by Rs159 per bag.
The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC), in a recent meeting, observed that fertiliser manufacturers would charge financing costs on the entire production of 6.2 million tonnes of fertiliser, providing them with undue benefits and increasing fertiliser prices in the country. The ministry was urged to resolve the issue at its own end, and in response, it was clarified that the financing cost would be charged only on 220,000 tonnes of imported urea. Regarding the supply of gas to fertiliser manufacturers, the ECC was informed that, as per past practice, the Petroleum Division would assess the existing arrangement of supplying gas/RLBG and provide gas to them on the best endeavour basis.
The ECC noted that the mechanism shall be further revised, and approval for an implementation mechanism, based on the principle of basket pricing, shall be placed before the cabinet. It was agreed that the National Fertiliser Marketing Limited (NFML) should determine the release price of imported urea. The Finance Division reiterated its stance that no additional subsidy would be provided on the supply of urea once the proposed mechanism of basket price is enforced.

Read Farmers await imported urea supply
In earlier decisions, the ECC had allowed the Trading Corporation of Pakistan to import 220,000 MT of urea from SOC 8, Azerbaijan, which was ratified by the cabinet on November 25, 2023. On October 23, 2023, the ECC decided that the subsidy on the imported Urea would be borne by the provinces. Another decision on November 15, 2023, determined that the cost recovery of the imported fertiliser would be made from the provinces. Since then, the government of Punjab conveyed that it would lift the imported urea by sharing the subsidy at a ratio of 50:50 between the federal and provincial governments. The government of Sindh committed to lifting its share of supply – 52,800 MT (24% of 220,000 MT) on a full-cost basis. Replies from Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa were awaited.
In short, provinces have not been able to commit to carrying the entire burden of subsidy. The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) informed that cost estimates for imports of Urea for the quantity 220,000 would be Rs27.489 billion, and the landed price of a 50 kg bag of Urea had been estimated at Rs6,248/bag. The National Fertiliser Marketing Limited (NFML) informed that the cost to be incurred by it on incidentals – transportation charges – storage/warehousing, etcetera, would be approximately Rs4,918.45 million.
The Ministry of Industries & Production further informed that the above situation was discussed in a meeting chaired by the prime minister on January 1, 2024. The following decisions were made: It was decided that locally manufactured urea and imported urea would be treated as one basket; Based on previous practices regarding local urea and full cost recovery of imported urea, a price matrix will be determined for local manufacturers of urea; A committee consisting of the following will engage urea manufacturers and finalise an implementation mechanism: secretary Petroleum Division; secretary, Ministry of Industries & Production; secretary Ministry of National Food Security & Research; secretary, and Ministry of Commerce.
