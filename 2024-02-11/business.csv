1,Protests against poll ‘rigging’ rock Balochistan,Demonstrating party workers block all main highways from Gwadar to Quetta to Chaman,"In Balochistan, political and religious political parties blocked all main highways as they intensified their protest against alleged election irregularities including rigging, manipulation of results, and undue delays in the announcement of poll results.
The demonstrations have led to blockades of major highways and the implementation of shutter-down strikes in several cities. “We do not accept these rigged elections,” National Party (NP) chief Dr Abdul Malik Baloch said. NP has been protesting in Kech district against alleged election irregularities. 
The Quetta-Chaman Highway, Quetta-Dera Ghazi Khan Road, Quetta-Sibi Road, Kolpur, Kech Turbat Road, and Zero Point in Gwadar are among the vital routes affected by the blockades which have caused significant disruptions to travel and hindrance in the movement of goods.
“I will not be part of this parliament until our seats are restored,” Mehmood Khan Achakzai, the chief of the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PKMAP), said. 
In Quetta, the provincial capital, various political and religious factions have blocked major intersections, including the Eastern Bypass, Western Bypass, Imdad Chowk, Gwalmandi Chowk, GPO Chowk, Spini Road and Brewery Road. The disruptions have paralyzed vehicular movement within the city and disrupted the daily routines of residents.
“Our protest will continue until all our concerns are addressed by the ECP,” Syed Abdul Wahid Agha, a JUI-F candidate, said while talking to The Express Tribune.
The protest movement has escalated dramatically in Chaman where demonstrators halted a passenger train, further intensifying the chaos and amplifying the impact of the protests against the alleged poll rigging.
Despite calls for restraint and appeals for dialogue, political and religious groups have persisted in holding rallies and demonstrations and have intensified their demands for electoral transparency and accountability.
Prominent political figures such as Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Akhtar Mengal have all voiced their reservations over poll delays and alleged election rigging. They have accused presiding officers of deliberately stalling the announcement of results, heightening suspicions of foul play in the electoral process. As protests continue to grip Balochistan, the pressure mounts on authorities to address the grievances of the protesters and restore confidence in the integrity of the electoral system.

2,JUI-F’s Akram Durrani expected to be next K-P opposition leader,His last two years in power were difficult with province experiencing rise in militancy,"Akram Khan Durrani of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) could once again be the leader of the opposition in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly. He has already served as opposition leader for two terms--from 2008 to 2013 and 2018 to 2023.
If elected leader of the opposition, he would serve in the position for a third time. The JUI-F has the largest number of Members of the Provincial Assembly (MPAs) among all opposition parties. Durrani also has the seniority for the post.
The JUI-F has seven MPAs in the K-P Assembly.
Durrani had contested provincial as well as National Assembly seats in the February 8 elections and had won provincial assembly seats from his home district of Bannu.
It may be recalled that Akram Khan Durrani had also served as K-P chief minister from 2002 to 2008 during the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) government, a stint during which he had kept the ruling alliance alive against heavy odds. His last two years in power had been especially difficult with the province experiencing a rise in militancy in both rural and urban areas for the first time, a trend that had worsened despite all his efforts.
