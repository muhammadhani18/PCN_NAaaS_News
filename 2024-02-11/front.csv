0,Maneuvering begins to cobble up 'PDM 2.0',PML-N ready to consider Shehbaz Sharif for post of premier,"A flurry of meetings took place in Lahore on Sunday, first the PML-N met the MQM-P and later with the PPP, where the parties, which in total have the numerical strength to form a coalition government, in “principle agreed to work together”.
PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif, younger brother of his party supremo Nawaz Sharif, along with a sizable delegation held his first official meeting with the PPP leadership at Lahore’s Bilawal House. He met with PPP co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari and his son, party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
However, in reality this was the second meeting between the two sides, with the first somewhat clandestine one held at Punjab caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s residence on February 9, where Nawaz’s message was communicated to the PPP leadership.
According to an insider, the PML-N supremo was expected to be present in the second meeting.
However, a party source claimed that within the PPP, Shehbaz bringing a fleet of leaders along with him was also seen as the PML-N’s lack of seriousness.
The PML-N delegation that met with the PPP leadership included Azam Nazeer Tarar, Ayaz Sadiq, Ahsan Iqbal, Rana Tanveer, Khawaja Saad Rafique, Malik Ahmad Khan, Marriyum Aurangzeb, and Shaza Fatima.
In light of the PML-N’s proposal, the PPP has called its Central Executive Committee meeting in Islamabad on Monday (today) where its demand for the premiership was expected to be decided.
Multiple sources have already told The Express Tribune that the PPP wanted the premiership for itself and not keen on giving this position to the PML-N leadership.
PPP spokesperson Faisal Kareem Kundi has reportedly said his suggestion before the Central Executive Committee would be for his party to either have their premier or sit in the opposition benches if the PML-N did not agree to it.
According to an official statement issued after this meeting, the participants expressed their commitment to putting the nation's interest and well-being above everything.
The leaders of both parties engaged in substantive discussions about the prevailing political landscape and the imperativeness of collaborative efforts for the betterment of the country.
Reflecting a spirit of consensus-building, the leaders acknowledged the importance of establishing a framework for sustained political cooperation between the PML-N and PPP, laying the groundwork for a stronger as well as more united approach to address the challenges faced by the nation.

The key points of the discussion included the assessment of Pakistan's overall situation; deliberations on future political strategies; as well as exchange of recommendations aimed at promoting stability and progress across the board.
Both parties affirmed their dedication to steering the country away from political instability and towards a path of prosperity as well as resilience.
Highlighting the mandate bestowed upon them by the majority of the nation, the leaders underscored their unwavering commitment to fulfilling the aspirations of the people.
They stressed the need for ensuring that the people’s voices were heard and heeded.
As a concrete step towards further dialogue and collaboration, the PML-N committed to present its suggestions to the PPP’s Central Executive Committee meeting, underscoring its willingness to actively contribute to the ongoing efforts aimed at enhancing political cohesion and efficacy.
Talking to a private TV news channel, Irfan Siddiqui, a PML-N leader, when asked about PPP’s desire of having their prime minister in the coalition set-up, said his party in its internal meeting had not decided its position on its former ally’s demand for the premier’s slot.
He said the PML-N was the majority party and that was why it had the prerogative of making its own premier.

Siddiqui added that the PML-N hoped that all parties in the alliance would adhere to democratic principles and norms.
He maintained that as of now, there had been no such concrete demand from either side in this connection.
Responding to a query about the Nawaz being the PML-N’s candidate for the premiership, he said if his party was in majority, this would have been a “no questions asked” scenario.
However, he continued that as the PML-N lacked the simple majority, it would not want any decision to be imposed on its partners. He added that his party and its partners would want to collectively decide the matter.
A PPP insider said his party wanted to see its leadership at the helm of affairs, but at this stage it was taking a cautious approach.
He said the PPP was busy roping in independent candidates quietly as opposed to the PML-N, which was celebrating its small victories.
He added that as the PML-N had the numerical advantage, the PPP wanted the dust to settle before makings its final decision.
A senior PML-N leader said as of now both parties had in principle agreed to work together to prevent the country from drifting into anarchy and denied the impression of any impasse between the two sides.
He added that the PML-N had put forth its suggestions before the PPP leadership and they would further be presented before the party's Central Executive Committee meeting for ratification.
The PML-N leader said Nawaz was not the only candidate for the premiership and the party was ready to nominate Shehbaz for the position if it came to that.
Separately, an MQM-P delegation led by its convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, that was in Lahore since Saturday, held its meeting with Nawaz, Shehbaz and other PML-N leaders at the party supremo’s residence in Jati Umra.
Apart from Siddiqui, the delegation included Dr Farooq Sattar, Kamran Tessori, and Mustafa Kamal.
After the meeting, Siddiqui refuted reports about talks on forming the next government in the meeting.
He also denied that his party had sought the slot of the Sindh governor.

“There is no time for [talks on] government formation and politics, but today only the threats faced by Pakistan as well as various options to get the country out of this quagmire have been discussed,” Siddiqui told the media in Lahore.
“Pakistan is facing a challenging situation and all the political parties as well as institutions should pull the country out of it,” he added.
He stressed the need for saving democracy in the country even if politics had to be sacrificed.
“The issue is not about power, but about the authority of the people and the stability of democracy.”
MQM-P leader Kamal, while talking to a private TV news channel, said even prior to the elections, his party had an understanding with the PML-N that they would work together in a coalition.
“So this meeting [with the PML-N leadership] was not to discuss the number of ministries and positions we would receive,” he maintained.
Kamal said the MQM-P’s decision revolved around the issues faced by the people.
He continued that his party wanted to ask the PML-N what it would to address the grievances of the people.
“This is the last chance for political parties to deliver.”
After the meeting, the PML-N released a statement saying the two parties had reached a “principle agreement” on working together.
“We will work together in the interest of the country and public,” the statement read, adding that “basic points” had been agreed upon by both the parties.
Apart from contacting other parties, consultations were under way within the PML-N as well.
A consultative meeting of the PML-N central leadership was held at the Jati Umra residence under the chairmanship of Nawaz in which the overall situation -- including the party’s position, government formation, as well as relations with other political parties and independent members –was discussed in detail.
The PML-N supremo was entrusted with the authority to nominate and convene meetings of party forums.
Nawaz was scheduled to pay a visit to PML-Q leader Chaudhry Shujaat at his residence. However, the meeting, apparently given its insignificance, was postponed. The PML-N supremo is expected to hold a meeting with JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.

1,Can PTI-loyalists really form government?,Former ruling party can claim reserve seats only after getting back its election symbol,"The PTI-backed independent candidates have outperformed all other political parties in the general elections. Yet, the question being asked nowadays is whether these candidates can unite to form the next central government.
According to party leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the PTI was leading at 170 National Assembly seats before the election results were allegedly rigged in the PML-N’s favour. He stated that the party intended to use legal avenues to highlight this rigging.
Barrister Gohar’s statement has come a day after PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif declared in his victory speech that the PML-N has emerged as the single largest party in Center and Punjab following the February 8’s general elections.
Technically, Nawaz was correct when he claimed that the PML-N emerged as the largest political party following the polls. This is because the PTI contested the general elections through independent candidates after losing its election symbol weeks before the polls due to failure to hold proper intra-party elections.
Currently, PTI-backed candidates hold 100 seats in the National Assembly, followed by the PML-N with 73 and the PPP with 54, out of a total of 266 seats in the lower house
Including the 70 reserved seats brings the total number of seats to 336. For a simple majority, a party needs to have at least 169 seats in the National Assembly.
Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob while answering different questions said, apparently, the PTI is not in a position to form the government without forming an alliance with major political parties like the PML-N or the PPP as it doesn’t have the required number for claiming majority in the lower house of the Parliament.
The PILDAT chief also explained in detail what will happen if the PTI-affiliated independent candidates can join the PTI again during the three-day post-election period.
He said it was possible. However, Mehboob explained, it will be a long route as it is mandatory that the party that the independent candidates want to join must have a party symbol.
Therefore, he said, if they want to join the PTI again, the PTI will have to hold intra-party elections and get its symbol back or any other symbol.
This exercise would enable PTI to get reserved seats in the National Assembly as well, he added, saying the condition about having a party symbol has been defined in Rule 94 of the ECP Rules of 2017.

Answering the question if PTI backed independents can join other registered parties like the MWM, Mehboob responded affirmatively, saying they can join the MWM or any other party.
If they do so, he said, they will be bound to follow that party’s discipline. If the PTI-backed candidates join the MWM or any other party, they can get reserve seats as proportionate to their total number of seats in the NA.
Roughly, if it happens, then they can get 25 to 27 seats provided their total seats remain around 100.
To get reserve seats after joining the MWM, Mehboob said the PTI-backed candidates will have to submit affidavits to the ECP stating that they were joining MWM or any other party.
Subsequently, he said, the head of the MWM or the party they join will have to give in writing to the ECP that he/she has accepted the independent candidates. He said this can take place within the 72 hours once the ECP issues the final poll results.
Mehboob replied in the affirmative again when asked whether the MWM can form a government if it gets the most seats. “For forming a government or electing a PM,” he said, “a party needs to have at least 169 seats in the NA.”
He said the question arises how will that number be achieved as the PTI-backed candidates’ current strength is around 100. However, he explained another scenario in which the PTI can form a government.
If no one gets the magic figure of 169 out of 336 NA seats in the first round when the house elects the prime minister, he said, then anyone having majority in the house that day can elect the PM of their choice or form the government. “Whoever has the majority in the second round can get the PM of their choice or form the government,” he said.
When asked as to what role the PTI-affiliated candidates can play if they combine into a non-party bloc, he said the independent candidates will not get reserve seats in that case and the 70 reserve seats will then be given to other parties based on their strength in the NA.
However, he said, if the PTI-backed candidates do not join any party, they can still get the position of the Leader of the Opposition in the NA. For that, he said, they will have to submit an application to the NA speaker stating that they support the nominated candidate.

2,Dozens of election results challenged in high courts,ECP orders re-polling at polling stations affected by vandalism,"Over a dozen petitions were filed in the high courts on Saturday, by several Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) backed candidates challenging the results of Thursday’s elections in their respective constituencies, announced by the returning officers (ROs) concerned.

Most of the election petitions were filed in the Lahore High Court (LHC), while two PTI-backed candidates moved the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the results, and at least three petitions were filed in the Sindh High Court (SHC).

The petitions in the LHC challenged victories of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Quaid Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz; Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) President Aleem Khan in different constituencies in Lahore.
PTI-backed Shoaib Shaheen and Ali Bukhari filed petitions in the IHC, against the results of the federal capital’s NA-47 and NA-48 constituencies, respectively. PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh moved the SHC against NA-238 results and Arsalan Khalid against NA-248 results.

The petitions in the LHC requested the courts to set aside the Form-47 prepared by the Returning Officers (ROs) in their absence, hence depriving them of their right to witness consolidation process of the election’s results.

The runner-ups contended that the police officials at the whims of the ROs of different constituencies forcefully restrained them from witnessing the process of result’s consolidation. Their eviction from the ROs offices was a sheer violation of the fair electoral process.

The petitioners challenged the victories of Nawaz Sharif from NA-130, Maryam Nawaz from NA-119, Khawaja Asif from NA-71 Sialkot, Hamza Shehbaz from NA-118, Atta Tarar from NA-127, Saiful Maluk Khokhar from NA-126, Aleem Khan from NA-117 and in other constituencies.

On the five seats of the provincial assembly, the PTI’s backed independent candidates challenged the results of PP-169, PP-53, PP-47, PP-62 and PP-46 on same ground of being evicted from the ROs offices, depriving them of their right to witness the consolidation process of the election’s results.

On Friday, LHC Justice Ali Baqar Najafi restrained the authorities concerned from proceeding further on the results of NA-128 in absence of the petitioner, PTI-backed independent candidate Salman Akram Raja or his agent.

In Islamabad, PTI-backed Shoaib Shaheen told reporters on the IHC premises that they filed the petitions with the request for the immediate hearing of their petitions. ""Today, I and Ali Bukhari have filed petitions. We have requested the registrar's office to schedule an immediate hearing,” he said.

According to the results announced a day earlier, independent candidate Raja Khuram Shehzad Nawaz won the election for NA-48 Islamabad-III by securing 69,699 votes. However, Bukhari claimed that he was winning in the initial results but later he had been declared as the runner-up with 59,851 votes.

A day earlier, Shaheen had slammed NA-47 results, where Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) Tariq Fazal Chaudhry was declared victorious. Shaheen blamed the powers that be for “pressuring the returning officers.”

“Today, you are replaying the crime you committed in the past. Now the only hope left is the judiciary,” he said. “They took away our bat [PTI’s electoral symbol]. I had a lead of more than 50,000 votes, my opponents had a total of 40,000 votes polled.”

In the petition filed in the SHC, Haleem Adil Sheikh said that he received more than 71,000 votes in NA-238 constituency, but Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) candidate Sadiq Iftikhar was declared successful by changing the results in Form 47.

Arslan Khalid contended in his plea that he got 65,000 votes in NA-248 constituency according to Form 45 but the RO concerned declared MQM's Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui as successful in Form 47. He requested the court to suspend the Form 47 result.

Nawaz also challenged the electoral result of NA-15 Mansehra-II. In a writ petition, Nawaz stated that several areas of Manshera were facing difficulties in communication due to snowfall. The request mentioned that over 125 polling stations did not submit Form 45, yet the results were announced.

Meanwhile, the ECP ordered re-polling at those polling stations in NA-88, Khushab, PS-18, Ghotki, PK-90, Kohat, where the polling material was snatched or destroyed. The re-polling would be held on February 15, after which the results would be announced, according to a press release.

In a separate, press release, the ECP said that Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) leader had been summoned on complaint of slapping a police officer on the election duty. The press release added that issue was placed before the ECP, after which she had been summoned.

4,Crackdown against PTI amid poll trickery allegations,"Several workers, supporters arrested; Khurrum Sher Zaman claims raid on house","The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) once again found itself under the hammer on Sunday after its workers and supporters hit the streets nationwide, accusing the system of electoral trickery and result manipulation in the general elections.
A number of PTI workers, leaders, candidates, voters, and supporters mobilised across various constituencies, alleging tampering with election outcomes to undermine their democratic mandate.
Demonstrations mushroomed across several cities including Lahore, Sialkot, Rawalpindi, Jhelum, Sumundari, Multan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Mansehra, Peshawar, Islamabad, Hyderabad, Karachi, and others.
Provincial administrations responded by deploying substantial police forces in most of these areas where the party announced assemblies to voice their dissent against alleged attempts to undermine the public mandate bestowed upon the nation's most prominent political entity.
In Lahore, a robust police presence, bolstered by prisoner transport vehicles, was observed at Liberty Chowk to deter PTI activists and supporters.
Throughout the day, officials from the police, anti-riot forces, elite units, and the Dolphin Squad convened at Liberty Chowk, instigating crackdowns against PTI demonstrators, voters, and their families gathered to protest alleged electoral manipulations in various National Assembly and provincial assemblies constituencies.
Authorities have also apprehended and detained numerous PTI workers and candidates, including Shehzad Farooq, the PTI candidate from NA-119 who contested against PML-N's Maryum Nawaz, for their involvement in protesting against purported election tampering.
In addition, law enforcement agencies resorted to dispersing PTI protestors in other cities through the use of tear gas and baton charges. Roads leading to returning officers’ (ROs) offices across various cities have also been barricaded by police.
PTI candidate Samira Elahi from Gujrat took to social media to draw attention to the purported house arrest of herself and her sister, Qasira Elahi, by the district administration, citing an excessive police presence.
She decried such treatment towards candidates as incomprehensible, affirming their commitment to counter all perceived conspiracies with the help of Allah Almighty.
Rawalpindi
In Rawalpindi, several PTI supporters were arrested by police after the latter sealed routes leading up to the entrance of the district election commission's office.
A number of police officers were deployed in the area. The closure of the district office also impacted the road leading to the press club, resulting in journalists encountering challenges in gaining access to the press club.
Following the closure of the ECP office, the PTI supporters gathered near Murree Road. The demonstrators expressed support in favour of party's incarcerated founding chairman Imran Khan.
All police stations have been directed to take action against protests taking place within their respective jurisdictions. The decision emphasises strict actions against any gathering or attempt to organise a rally within the jurisdiction of a police station.
In a related development, Rawalpindi Regional Police Officer (RPO) Syed Khurram Ali and City Police Officer (CPO) Rawalpindi Syed Khalid Hamdani took notice of violence against media personnel from a news channel during the protest in the Sadiqabad area.
The police authorities appointed an SP as the inquiry officer and summoned a report within the next 24 hours.
RPO and CPO Rawalpindi acknowledged the severity of the violence against professional journalists, expressing deep concern over the incident.
CPO Rawalpindi assured that stringent departmental measures would be initiated against the responsible official once a thorough investigation into the matter has been conducted.
Karachi
Meanwhile, demonstrations were also held outside the provincial election commission office in Karachi, where protesters raised concerns about alleged rigging and manipulation of election results.
PTI leader Khurrum Sher Zaman, accompanied by fellow leaders, led the protest.
Denouncing the ""robbery of public mandate,"" Khurrum asserted that Karachi was, and still is, PTI's turf.
Alleging the theft of PTI’s mandate, he alleged there were attempts to sow discord between PTI and the police.
“We are peaceful Pakistanis,” the PTI leader asserted while encouraging demonstrators to maintain peace and clarified that PTI had no intention of clashing with law enforcement.

He further declared the party's decision to take the battle to the courts, submitting relevant applications to address their grievances.
Khurrum Sher Zaman announced plans to present Form 45 in court, adding that the PTI has already filed an application in this regard.
In a later statement, he revealed that his residence underwent a raid the previous night.
Condemning what he termed ""unjust and intimidatory tactics,"" Khurrum called on the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), Chief of Army Staff (COAS), and Inspector General (IG) Sindh to take notice of the alleged harassment against him and his family.
In a post on 'X', he vehemently expressed his condemnation and urged swift action against the reported incidents.

5,"PTI asserts majority, urges respect for public mandate","Gohar urges ECP to immediately announce all results, says Alvi would invite his party to form government","As final results still trickled in on Saturday, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) claimed a majority in the Centre, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said President Arif Alvi would invite his party to form the government as they had secured a majority in the National Assembly.
Addressing a news conference, jointly convened with the party’s Central Spokesperson Raoof Hasan on Saturday, Gohar emphasised that everybody should respect the public mandate.
“We have no quarrel with anyone, we want to move forward. We will proceed and form a government in accordance with the constitution and the law,"" he clarified.
""We will constitute the government in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the Centre, and the announcement of the KP chief minister will be made in two days.”
Taking a dig at former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Gohar stated, ""Nawaz Sharif does not have a majority in the NA, but he still considers himself the prime minister.""He said the elections were held freely and peacefully and today is a very important day in the democratic history of Pakistan. The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) should immediately announce all results.
He highlighted that, according to the law, it was the commission's duty to release results by 2am, yet the announcement was delayed until 10am. The reasons for this deviation from the scheduled time need clarification, he added.
He said that presiding officers counted votes and prepared Form 45, however, results were stopped around midnight and an attempt was made to snatch public mandate. The PTI chief said the results should be made according to Form 45 as they had received all those forms.
He also announced to hold peaceful protests on Saturday outside those RO offices, who have not announced the result yet. He warned that the economy would not be able to tolerate the suppression of peoples' voice and forming a desired government.
“No obstacle should be created for the PTI and results should be announced as soon as possible. As per the law, the final result is extracted from Form 45 and we have received all the results,” he said adding that the final results should be announced before 12am tonight.

Gohar said their independent candidates were in contact with the party. They were loyal to the party and would remain so, he added. He said that the party would make their independent government while ruling out the possibility of collation with the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP).
He said the PTI would go towards intra-party elections within 15 days after completion of the process. The people had given a big mandate to the PTI, he maintained.He underscored that all cases against the PTI founding chairman Imran Khan were fake and fabricated. ""It was merely political victimisation. It is the responsibility of the superior judiciary to look into the affairs of the lower courts.""
Answering a question, Gohar said Imran Khan is the chairman of PTI and will remain the party chairman.
“Though, I may be in the driving seat but Imran Khan is my leader and he will decide who will be the next prime minister of Pakistan. The party will soon announce its strategy regarding reserved seats as well as what party they should join.”

6,‘PPP wants premiership’,"Bilawal said party was waiting for the complete results to be declared, before taking its move","The PPP is open to a coalition government with the PML-N, if it gets the coveted position of premiership, a source within the party told The Express Tribune on Saturday.
Though, the PPP party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari who is party’s pick for the post of prime minister. However, the source said that the party could revisit this decision but it would unlikely to favour Nawaz Sharif.
As the PML-N was expeditiously trying to cobble up alliances with the PPP and the MQM-P to form a coalition government at the Center and in other provinces, the PPP seemed to be taking a more cautious approach.
Bilawal on Saturday appeared on different TV screen to declare that party was waiting for the complete results to be declared, before taking its move. This position was in line with what several sources were revealing earlier that PPP was more interested in exploring all options before taking its decision.
They revealed PPP wanted to garner support of as many independent candidates as possible to consolidate its position.
Another source insisted that the PPP was not too keen on the idea of giving the premiership to PML-N. He said that PPP would want to see Bilawal as the next prime minister but given the acceptability issue with powerful quarters, the party has former president Asif Ali Zardari for this slot.
He said that giving up the premiership, was not something that the PPP wanted.
Asked about the meeting between Zardari and PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, he added that this meeting at caretaker chief minister’s residence was “not purely out of free will”. He said that there were powers at play and the PPP was trying to navigate its way through landmines.
The second source said that the idea of presidency or the governorship was not enticing for the PPP as some might think. “The PPP wants to lead from the front,” he said. In case, the PML-N did not offer this position to the PPP,” he said, then, according to his understanding “even if all other options do not pan out”, PPP should sit on the opposition benches.
Party information secretary and spokesperson were not available for comments.

7,New govt pivots around PPP: Bilawal,"PPP chief insists govts at Centre, Punjab can’t be formed without his party","Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said on Saturday that no government could be formed at the Centre and in Punjab and Balochistan provinces without the inclusion of his party, but made it clear that so far, no such had taken place with any political party.
In an interview with a private news channel, Bilawal said he still awaited the completion of the vote count in all constituencies before engaging in discussions on cobbling up alliances for the formation of governments.
According to Bilawal, any party taking shot at the government formation at the Centre, and in Punjab, besides Balochistan, would require the support of the PPP lawmakers, whose number is 54 in the National Assembly, 10 in Punjab Assembly and 11 in Balochistan Assembly.
There is no majority party in these assemblies. The PTI-backed independents are the largest group in the National Assembly with nearly 100 members, followed by the PML-N with 73, while both are tied at 134 in the Punjab. The PTI-backed independents won in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and the PPP in Sindh.
""So far, there have been no formal talks with either the PML-N, PTI, or any other political party,"" Bilawal told the channel. ""We are waiting for the completion of the vote count in all constituencies, and the results to be unveiled,"" he added.
The interview came a day after the PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif announced that his party intended to form a government at the Centre and in Punjab with support of potential allies. He tasked former prime minister Shehbaz Sharif to contact the potential allies and win over their support.
In this regard, reports had suggest that Shehbaz had met the PPP leadership, including Bilawal and former president Asif Zardari in Lahore. He also reached out to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) by the telephone, inviting them to Lahore for further talks.
Before Thursday’s elections, the PPP Central Executive Committee had nominated Bilawal as their candidate for prime minister. Bilawal said that if this decision needed to be changed, “we will once again convene” the CEC meeting.
Bilawal underscored the importance of a “political consensus” and a “national unity” government, without which, he stressed, the government would face challenges in delivering effective governance. ""A government should be formed with national unity to bring political stability,” he said.

When asked about any contacts with the PTI-backed independents, who formed the largest group in the National Assembly, the PPP chief remarked: ""Some informal contacts are present in our relationships, but so far, there has been no contact with the PTI bloc.""
Speaking about his own agenda for the future government, Bilawal stressed that that people’s problems could not be address without addressing the core national issue of political instability. He emphasised that he wanted political stability in the country.
""I want to end the politics of hate and division. I cannot indulge in the old style of politics. We want to bring political stability in our country,"" he told the interviewer. ""It is in the country's interest to build political unity,” he added.
Asked about the credibility of the elections, Bilawal said that he was not disappointed with the voting. However, he appeared critical, when he said that he was winning in Lahore with a big margin at midnight on February 8 but the situation was entirely changed in the morning.
Political analysts indicate that any coalition, involving the PML-N, the PPP and the MQM-P would be another version of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led coalition government in the country after the removal of the PTI government through a no-confidence motion in April 2022.
Some media reports suggested that in their overnight talks in Lahore, the PML-N and the PPP agreed to form a coalition government at the Centre and Punjab but sides were reluctant to confirm the development.
“He [Bilawal] clarified the PPP party position with unambiguous clarity: at NO point after the election has the party spoken with N League on Federal, Balochistan or Punjab government formation,” PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said in her tweet.
Similarly, PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said in a separate tweet that no final decisions had been taken in the meeting between Shahbaz and Zardari. “Further discussion has been agreed upon; Mr. Asif Zardari will definitely consult his party,” she wrote in a tweet on ‘X’.
Aurangzeb underscored that independent winners were “very important” in the electoral process but said that the PML-N remained the largest party in the federation. “We recognize the mandate of all. Tomorrow is an important meeting,” she added.
Meanwhile, three newly-elected independent members of National Assembly, Barrister Aqeel, Raja Khurram Nawaz, and Mian Khan Bugti, announced their support for the PML-N on Saturday. However, Raja’s election victory from federal capital had been challenged in the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
