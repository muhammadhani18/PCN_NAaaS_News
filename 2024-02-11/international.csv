0,Mirza family routed from Badin politics,Analysts attribute the downfall of Mirza family to rift with PPP,"The Mirza family of Badin, long-time adversaries of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and outspoken critics of the Zardari family, has been routed, losing all seats from the district for the first time since their entry into parliament in 1993.
Dr Zulfiqar Mirza, the former home minister of Sindh, his wife Dr Fehmida Mirza, Pakistan's first female National Assembly speaker, and their son Barrister Hasnain Mirza failed to maintain their political dominance in Badin, attributing their decline to the ""rifts"" with the PPP.
According to a close associate of the Mirza family, ""A financially weak Mirza family cannot defeat the PPP's affluent landlords.""
Originally hailing from Hyderabad, Dr Zulfiqar Mirza gained prominence in Sindh in the late 1980s through his association with Asif Ali Zardari, the former president and PPP co-chairperson. He entered the National Assembly in 1993 by defeating Mir Murtaza Bhutto, the brother of Benazir Bhutto, in Badin.
After a break from politics, Dr Fehmida entered the political arena and won as MNA from her husband's constituency in 1996. She continued her electoral success in the same constituency until the 2018 general elections.
Dr Zulfiqar distanced himself from the PPP leadership in 2010, while Dr Fehmida and their son Hasnain remained with the party until 2015. In 2018, the family joined the Grand Democratic Alliance, securing MNA and MPA positions from Badin and Tando Bago seats.
In 2018, Dr Zulfiqar faced defeat at the hands of the PPP's Muhammad Ismail Rahu from Shaheed Fazal Rahu taluka. The family also introduced their younger son, Muhammad Hassam Mirza, in local government and general elections, but he failed to secure a prominent position.
In 2024, the Mirza family faced uncertainty as their nomination papers were initially rejected, only to be approved by the court a few days before the election day.
Hasnain Mirza was defeated by the PPP's Arbab Ameer Amanullah from Tando Bago, while Hassam Mirza faced losses in both provincial and National Assembly seats in Badin.

1,Protests erupt across Sindh over alleged poll rigging,JUI-F's Fazal calls for widespread protests on February 11,"A day after the election results were announced, protests erupted in several districts of Sindh on Saturday, as losing candidates and their political parties alleged irregularities in the vote counting system. The Jamaat-e-Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) has called for widespread protests on February 11.
Maulana Rashid Mehmood Soomro, the provincial leader of JUI-F, led a sit-in outside a temporary office of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in Sukkur district on Saturday. Soomro claimed that the results were manipulated to favour the Pakistan Peoples Party and warned of blocking the National Highway at 28 different locations in Sindh from Karachi to Kashmore. He set a deadline of 8am on February 11 for the ECP to accept their demands.
Soomro demanded the issuance of Form 47 declaring JUI-F's Mubeen Ahmed as the winner from Sukkur and other candidates from their respective constituencies in the districts of Larkana division. Close contests were observed in some constituencies of Larkana division between the PPP and JUI-F. The PPP secured NA-191 Jacobabad with a slim margin of around 3,000 votes against JUI-F's Shahzain Khan, who garnered 100,652 votes.
In Badin district, candidates from the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), led by former speaker of the National Assembly Dr Fehmida Mirza and former Sindh home minister Dr Zulfiqar Mirza, along with their supporters, held a sit-in protest at DC Chowk. Dr Zulfiqar alleged organised rigging through the District Returning Officers (DROs) and Returning Officers (ROs) in these elections, accusing the PPP of imposing mafias in the guise of elected representatives on the people of Badin.
Meanwhile, in Dadu district, former Sindh chief minister Liaquat Ali Jatoi, fighting on GDA's ticket, accused the ROs of rigging the polling outcomes. Jatoi lost both his seats, NA-227 and PS-81, to his PPP rivals, claiming that rigging occurred, and his supporters and polling agents were assaulted in many places. Another GDA candidate from Dadu on PS-82, Aashiq Ali Zaunr, asserted having evidence of rigging which he plans to submit before the tribunal.
Even the PPP faced protests against alleged rigging. Ali Muhammad Sahito and Abdul Jabbar Khan, the party's contestants from NA-219 and PS-62 in Hyderabad, blocked Hyderabad bypass in protest late on Friday night, burning tires and disrupting traffic. They alleged unjustified delays in announcing results for their constituencies and NA-220 and PS-64, accusing the changes to favour MQM-P.
In Mirpurkhas, supporters of independent candidate Salamat Lakho reportedly assaulted presiding staff with batons at polling station number 313 at Iqra Higher Secondary School on Friday. The presiding officer, Ali Hassan Panhwar, lodged a complaint with the Satellite police station on Saturday, nominating Lakho and his supporters for attacking them with batons and axes.

While PPP is poised to form the Sindh government for the fourth consecutive term, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) after winning 28 provincial assembly seats, took back most of its mandate.
The Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) which rose to prominence in 2018 elections as a formidable force was ousted from the parliamentary politics of Sindh. 
The Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) seats increased from one to two. As many as 13 independent candidates also succeed in reaching Sindh Assembly. In case of independent candidates joining political parties, the quota of specific seats of these parties will increase further. The Election Commission has ordered a re-poll at two polling stations of PS-18.
According to the election results, PPP won 10 seats from Karachi, 74 seats from other districts of Sindh and a total of 84 provincial assembly seats. According to conservative estimates, the PPP is likely to get 19 seats for women and 6 seats for minorities. In this way, the number of People's Party members in the Sindh Assembly by completing the century will reach to 109.
MQM Pakistan won 25 seats from Karachi, 3 from Hyderabad and a total of 28 seats. MQM is expected to get 6 reserved seats for women and 2 reserved seats for minorities, after which MQM-P number of seats in in Sindh Assembly is expected to reach 37 seats, while GDA and Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) are expected to get 1 reserved seat each for women. Thus their number of candidates will reach to three each in the provincial assembly.
The electorate in Karachi has also chosen 10 independent candidates, while three independents were elected from other districts. These 13 successful candidates are required to affiliate with a political party within three days of receiving notification of their victory. Following their affiliation, the party they join stands to benefit from an expanded quota of reserved seats. The House of Sindh Assembly consists of 168 members. There are 130 general seats, 29 reserved seats for women and nine for minorities.
If we look at the 2018 general elections, GDA failed to save the mandate it got in 2018. In 2018, GDA had won 11 general seats of Sindh Assembly from Badin, Shikarpur, Larkana and Khairpur.
Three former Chief Ministers Ghous Ali Shah, Liaquat Jatoi and Arbab Rahim also faced defeat in 2024 general elections.
In 2018 general elections, MQM won 13 Sindh Assembly seats, out of which 10 were from Karachi and 3 from Hyderabad. MQM won 15 more Sindh Assembly seats in 2024 general elections than in 2018.
In 2018, Jamaat-e-Islami had won one seat in Sindh Assembly, while in 2024 it got two seats. Similarly, in 2018 elections TLP had won two seats of Sindh Assembly, while in 2024 it failed to win even a single seat.

4,Haleem challenges results in SHC,"PTI candidate disputes the outcomes for NA-238, NA-248, and PS-98","PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh has challenged the election results for various constituencies in the Sindh High Court. In a petition filed through Barrister Tahir Ali, Sheikh disputes the outcomes for NA-238, NA-248, and PS-98.
According to the petition, Form 45 indicates that Sheikh secured over 71,000 votes in NA-238. However, MQM-P candidate Sadiq Iftikhar was declared the winner with 54,000 votes, allegedly due to changes in Form 47. The petition seeks the annulment of the notification declaring Sadiq Iftikhar successful.
In the case of Arslan Khalid, an independent candidate from NA-248, the petition asserts that he received 65,000 votes according to Form 45. However, MQM-Pakistan's Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui was declared the winner in Form 47. The petition calls for the suspension of Form 47 and withholding of the results. Similarly, the independent candidate Jan Sher Junejo, in the petition related to PS-98 of the Sindh Assembly, claims to have received 120,167 votes as per Form 45, while MQM-Pakistan candidate Arslan Pervaiz, declared successful in Form 47, allegedly garnered only 1,772 votes. The petition urges the court to declare Form 47 null and void.
