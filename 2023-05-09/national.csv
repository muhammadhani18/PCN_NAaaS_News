0,Alvi says upholding Constitution is responsibility of all,"Says the statute guarantees political stability, ensures citizens’ rights.","ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Monday said upholding the Constitution was the responsibility of all segments of society as the document not only guaranteed political stability but also ensured citizens’ fundamental rights.
“The supremacy of the Constitution is vital as its pillars set out the goals for basic rights in various areas, including education, health, employment, and social and economic justice,” the president said in his address at a ceremony held at the Presidency to recognise public contribution towards social welfare.
“The Constitution vested its power in citizens which led to realising a welfare state with a political system based on social justice. A constitution does not belong to a politician or an institution, but to every individual of the country,” he added.
In addition to the administrative authority, the president said, it is the duty of the state and its organs to bring about improvement to the society through a system based on welfare.

Says the statute guarantees political stability, ensures citizens’ rights

The event, organised by the Network for Human and Social Development (NHSD), acknowledged the services of departments and individuals in the field of humanitarian service and philanthropy.
President Alvi emphasised the importance of social welfare and philanthropy to address the problems amid the growing population, particularly in the shape of poverty, illiteracy and unemployment.
As per Unicef data, he said, the 27 million out-of-school children of Pakistan were a serious challenge that required urgent steps for their inclusion in the educational and skill-set system. Also, the country’s 10 per cent population of persons with disabilities needed mainstreaming, he added.
Mr Alvi highlighted the importance of adopting a preventive approach to health rather than a curative one to cope with the costly treatment of several diseases, including hepatitis, AIDS and communicable ailments.
He said national progress was linked with the implementation of the system of social caring and improving the lives of the people.
Addressing the ceremony, NHSD president Amir Ikram Ameen said his organisation was serving the cou­ntry’s vulnerable communities thro­ugh disaster management and mitigating disaster risk through poverty alleviation and provision of educational and health facilities to women and children in remote villages.
Vice chairman of Akhuwat Foundation’s standing committee Badar Haroon said the welfare organisation had in 20 years empowered the people through microfinance loans worth Rs200 billion with a 99.9pc return rate.
He said 2,000 transgender persons above 50 years of age were registered with Akhuwat Foundation, which was catering to their medical facilities in a respectable way.
ACT International CEO Syed Mubashir Ali Shah Banoori said his organisation in close coordination with government departments rolled out several projects during the recent flood emergency by providing the affected communities with food and shelter. Also, the provision of seeds, fertilisers, livelihood training, and restoration of agriculture at large is also being carried out, he added.
On the occasion, President Alvi gave away acknowledgement shields to the organisations and individuals who contributed towards social welfare in their respective areas.

2,Rohale seeks action over ‘blasphemy’ in PTI rallies,PML-N MNA Sheikh Rohale Asghar claims two incidents occurred during PTI's gatherings.,"ISLAMABAD: A PML-N lawmaker has exp­ressed serious concerns over incidents of alle­ged blasphemy during PTI’s events and urged the government to take notice of the issues.
On Monday, Sheikh Rohale Asghar, the MNA from Lahore, said he was worried over the situation after the recent incident in Mardan where a cleric was lynched by an enraged mob after rumours that he had uttered alleged blasphemous remarks.
Speaking on a point of order in the National Assembly, Mr Asghar said the incident took place at a gathering organised by the PTI to express solidarity with the judiciary.
He was referring to the incident on Saturday, where a cleric, Nigar Alam, was beaten to death in Sawa­ldher village after a crowd interpreted his remarks to be allegedly blasphemous. The footage of Mr Alam’s speech, as well as that of his killing, went viral on social media.

Says two incidents occurred during party’s gatherings

The PML-N lawmaker also referred to another PTI gathering where a child uttered alleged blasphemous remarks while praising former prime minister Imran Khan in the presence of PTI leaders.
Mr Asghar regretted that no action has been taken against any PTI leader who was present at the event and also against those responsible for the child’s upbringing.
He claimed that the PTI leaders were promoting a culture of “incivility and indecency” and called for steps to thwart this trend.
Smuggling at Pak-Afghan border
Earlier, PPP’s Qadir Khan Mandokhail moved a calling attention notice on the smuggling of counterfeit medicines through Afghan  border.
Responding to the notice, Minister for Par­liamentary Affairs Murtaza Javed Abbasi said Customs and the army were making efforts to prevent smuggling and illegal trade across the border. He said counterfeit medicines worth Rs778m were recently seized near the border.
The authorities have thwarted around 36 other attempts to smuggle counterfeit medicine thr­ou­­gh the border. He said there were only two check posts at Torkham and Chaman on a long and porous border with Afghanistan, Mr Abbasi said.
The house proceedings will resume today (Tuesday).

3,One cop martyred  in attacks on  police in KP,"The martyred constable, Naseem Khan was on duty at the Al Haj post in the Bara area when the militants attacked with sniper rifles.","KHYBER/PESHAWAR: A police constable was martyred in a midnight attack on a police check post in Tehsil Bara of district Khyber tribal district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police said on Monday.
The martyred constable, Naseem Khan was on duty at the Al Haj post in the Bara area when the militants attacked with sniper rifles.
The attackers managed to flee while no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.
The funeral of the martyred cop was offered at the Shah Kas police lines which was attended by Peshawar Capital City Police Officer Mohammad Ijaz Khan and the Khyber DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi, along with other police officials and notables of the area.
Separately, a police post came under attack on Sunday night in the Adezai area, some 30km south of Peshawar.
According to the police, unknown attackers hurled a hand grenade which blew up near the post. This was followed by intense firing which damaged motorbikes parked near the police post. No loss of life was reported in the attack.
The attack took place around 12:15am, said Imranuddin, the SHO of Mattani police station, where the post was located.
He told Dawn that empties have been collected from the spot and sent for analysis while the Counter Terrorism Department has been requested to register a case.

4,Sajid Sadpara set to scale Everest without oxygen,"No Pakistani mountaineer has ever achieved such a feat, says son of legendary Ali Sadpara.","GILGIT: Sajid Ali Sadpara, a Pakistani climber and the son of legendary mountaineer late Mohammad Ali Sadpara, is set to summit the world’s highest mountain, Mount Everest (8,848.86 metres), in Nepal without the use of supplemental oxygen or Sherpa support.
His ultimate goal is to climb all 14 eight-thousanders without the aid of supplemental oxygen. Currently, he is in Nepal and preparing for the climb.
Earlier, on April 15, 2021, Sajid made history by becoming the first Pakistani to scale the 8,091-metre Annapurna mountain in Nepal, which is the world’s 10th highest peak, without the assistance of high-altitude porters and supplemental oxygen.
Sajid has already summited several high peaks, including K2 (8,611m), Gasherbrum-I (8,080m), and Gasherbrum-II (8,035m) in Pakistan, as well as Manaslu (8,163m) in Nepal, without supplemental oxygen.
He told Dawn that he has com­­pleted the necessary acclimatisation in Nepal and plans to begin his Everest mission on May 20.

No Pakistani mountaineer has ever achieved such a feat, says son of legendary Ali Sadpara

In response to a question, Sajid said that he has been supporting renowned Nepalese mountaineer Nirmal Purja and other Nepali climbers supported him.
“I will be using the ground logistic support of Seven Summit Trek, my primary host,” Sajid said.
Sajid said he has not received sponsorship from the Gilgit-Baltistan government, any other organisation, or donor.
He is undertaking this mission to honour the memory of his late father to raise the Pakistani flag on the world’s highest mountains.
In a statement Sajid noted that 45 years ago on this date in 1978, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler achieved something that was once considered scientifically impossible — summitting Everest without the use of supplemental oxygen support, which was considered the ultimate challenge in mountaineering.
Less than 200 have summited Everest without oxygen so far, in comparison with over 5,000 with use of oxygen, making it a rare accomplishment.
“In the history of Pakistani mountaineering, no one has ever climbed Everest without oxygen. It was a dream of my father to accomplish this Ultimate Mountaineering Challenge,” Sajid said.
Sadpara had another dream of summiting K2 in winter, which he ultimately achieved, but tragically, he did not return to celebrate the achievement with his loved ones.
He remains in Sajid’s heart and mind, and his lessons guide him in his most challenging times.
“He remains in my heart and mind and his lessons guides me in my most challenging times. My father always taught me to follow one’s dream,” he said.

5,Pakistan’s internet ‘among the slowest’ in world: report,"Around 15pc people still lack broadband access; cybercrime rises, net banking sees boom.","KARACHI: Pakistan has one of the lowest internet speeds in the world, while a huge chunk of the population still lacks access to the internet, said a new report on the digital landscape and human rights in the country on Monday.
The report prepared by Bytes for All, Pakistan, a prominent digital rights organisation, stated that while Pakistan has made some gains in terms of internet access and overall governance, there was still a lot more to be desired as the country remained among the worst performers, even within Asia.
Despite increased internet penetration, around 15 per cent of the population has no access to internet and telecom services, while the rest suffers through slow speeds and erratic service, said the report titled ‘Internet Landscape Report 2022’
As of December 2022, Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index saw Pakistan ranked 118 out of 141 countries in terms of mobile internet speed, and 150 out of 178 countries for fixed broadband speed, with an average speed of 10.15-15.5Mbps, according to a press release.

Around 15pc people still lack broadband access; cybercrime rises, net banking sees boom

The gender gap in terms of mobile ownership also widened in Pakistan with just half of women owning a mobile phone, as compared to over 75pc men.
Cybercrime, blasphemy, disinformation
The report also stated that cybercrime was on the rise with over 100,000 complaints registered by December 2022, marking the highest number in the last five years.
Women continue to make up the majority of victims facing harassment and blackmail online.
“The online environment remains perilous, with the threat of blasphemy allegations, online campaigning, mob organising, and subsequent violence, including lynching,” according to the report.
No meaningful action was taken by the authorities over cases originating from accusations in the digital space, it added.
The report stated over 0.3m cybercrime complaints were registered between 2020 and 2022, but only 124 people were convicted, as per the interior ministry data.
Meanwhile, the state continued with its alleged attempts to muzzle criticism and control online spaces, including filing cases against journalists, activists and political opponents “for expressing unfavourable views on social media”.
“Attempts were also made to pass stricter defamation laws to suppress dissent,” the report added.
Internet banking boom
The local e-commerce and fintech sectors experienced negative trends due to the global economic downturn and Pakistan’s crises, the report said, adding that funding for startups significantly declined in the second half of 2022.
Despite the decline in funding, Pakistan’s startups managed to secure $348 million in funds.
On the other hand, internet banking transactions witnessed a steep rise of 51.7pc in 2022, as internet banking users increased by almost 60pc to 3.1 million.
The State Bank’s move to issue a licensing framework for digital banks will further accelerate the progress towards digital banking, the report said. The report also featured analysis from IT and Telecommunication Minister Syed Aminul Haq; Bytes for All, Pakistan Senior Program Manager Haroon Baloch and other stakeholders.

6,New gate for transit trade opened at Chaman border,Sources say the old Friendship Gate would be used for traditional trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan.,"

Traders from both sides and officials of Pakistan Customs and local administration greet each other at the inauguration of the crossing gate.—Dawn

 
QUETTA: A new crossing gate for transit trade was opened at the Chaman border on Monday to facilitate the business communities of Pakistan and Afghanistan. 
The new facility was jointly established by the chambers of commerce and industry of Chaman and Spin Boldak with the help of the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan. 
Chaman Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s member Haji Jalaat Khan inaugurated the new crossing gate at a ceremony held at the Pak-Afghan border. 
A large number of business leaders and traders from both sides and officials of Pakistan Customs and administrations of Chaman and Spin Boldak attended the ceremony. 
Spin Boldak Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s representative Haji Sadiqullah inaugurated the new gate from the Afghan side. 
Chaman is the only town along the Afghan border where a separate official crossing point was established for trucks to carry transit trade goods from both sides. 
Officials said the second crossing gate was established in view of the increasing number of the vehicles carrying Pak-Afghan transit trade goods which would now be cleared in less time at customs. 
They said the new gate, which was constructed around one kilometre away from the Friendship Gate at Chaman, also provided a separate crossing facility to the Afghan and Pakistani women. Only families could use this crossing point, they said. 
Sources said the old Friendship Gate would be used for traditional trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan and normal crossing of people from both sides. 
They said the new crossing point was established to provide more facilities to the business communities of both countries. 
The business communities of Pakistan and Afghanistan welcomed the opening of the new crossing gate at the Chaman border and said it would help in smooth transit trade between both counties.

7,Duty-free vehicle import facility withdrawn,Govt reverses the facility of temporary import of duty-free vehicles for overseas Pakistanis and restricts it only to foreign tourists.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has reversed the facility of temporary import of duty-free vehicles for overseas Pakistanis and restricted it only to foreign tourists.
A series of amendments were made through a customs notification, SRO533, by amending rules for temporary import of vehicles.
Over the last five years, 1000 vehicles entered Pakistan under the tourist facility, while only 900 were verified to have left the country. The Customs department is still looking for the remaining 100 vehicles, including untraceable heavy bikes.
Under this facility, the government allowed tourists to bring vehicles into the country and take back to their home country.
Three significant changes have been introduced in the facility. The major change was that the temporary import of vehicle facilities was withdrawn for Pakistani passport holders. Now only foreign passport holders will be allowed to bring vehicles into the country.
All manual procedures have been done away with and replaced with a computerised system to help travellers and to keep a check on misuse of the facility.
At the same time, a monthly report will be prepared to check the status of vehicles that overstay and to suggest timely penalties.
At the end of every month, the officer in charge at the customs station of entry will reconcile all vehicles which entered through that station. If the records reveal that taxes and duties are outstanding against a vehicle   after the expiry of the retention period, steps will be taken to recover all dues. Seizure of the vehicle may also be considered.
An official announcement of the FBR said that to check the misuse of carnet de-passage/temporary import of vehicles by foreigners/expatriate Pak­istanis, the Federal Board of Revenue has issued SRO 533 to amend the temporary import of vehicles’ rules covered under Chapter VI of the Customs Rules 2001.
Carnet is an international customs document that permits duty-free and tax-free import of goods for one year.
Definition of ‘tourist’
Under the new rules, the definition of “tourist” has been updated. New provisions have been incorporated to strictly monitor carnet-related information through Pakistan Customs computerised system and by liaising closely with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
The tourist’s passport will be flagged with carnet documents to properly reconcile vehicles imported under the facility.

8,Balochistan to notify information commission in fortnight,"“The ministerial committee received the draft rules in February, and a committee has been established to oversee the process,"" says official.","ISLAMABAD: While information commissions exist at federal level and three provinces of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh, Balochistan Information Secretary Hamza Shafqaat on Monday revealed that the provincial government would notify the information commission in a fortnight.
He was speaking to participants in a meeting of the National Forum of Information Commissioners (NFIC) convened by Centre for Peace and Development Initiatives in Islamabad. Information commissioners from the federal, KP, Punjab and Sindh attended the meeting. 
The commissioners reiterated their commitment to promoting transparency and accountability in Pakistan, with a focus on ensuring public access to information.
Mr Shafqaat said public information officers (PIO) have been appointed, nominated in all public bodies by the order of Balochistan chief secretary, and rules have been drafted and vetted by the law department.
“The ministerial committee received the draft rules in February, and a select committee has been established to oversee the process. The Balochistan commission and the rules of the Balochistan RTI Act 2021 will be notified within the next 15 days, marking a significant step forward in promoting transparency and accountability in the province,” he said.
Earlier,  CPDI executive director Mukhtar Ahmad Ali provided an overview of the historical and legislative landscape of the right to information and freedom of information in Pakistan. He highlighted that concrete efforts to promote RTI began in 2013, when dominant political parties in KP and Punjab competing in political arena added to the RTI implementation in their provinces. He emphasised that the emergence of RTI in Pakistan was the biggest reform in contemporary times, representing a transformation from secrecy to transparency. He demanded that federal and provincial governments ensure administrative and budgetary support of information commissions so that appellate bodies could perform their duties in optimal manner.
During the event, chief information commissioner Shoaib Ahmad Siddiqui discussed the progress and challenges of Pakistan Information Commission. 
He identified key challenges, including shortage of staff and sanctioned posts, low level of awareness among citizens, delayed appointments of information commissioner, and delays in finalising service rules. He said that all the challenges were currently being addressed by the commission as it continued to work towards ensuring that citizens have access to the information they need.
Chief Information Commissioner of the KP Farah Hamid expressed her concerns about the commission’s prolonged lack of quorum, which resulted in its dysfunction. Despite this setback, she noted that the commission was actively striving to enhance public awareness, especially among women citizens, through the use of proactive disclosure and innovative information technology.
She further explained that bureaucratic hurdles, lack of funding, political uncertainty, and a lack of government commitment have created significant obstacles for the commission, which was working diligently to address these challenges and fulfill its mandate.
Chief Information Commissioner of Sindh Information Commission Dr Syed Jawaid Ali acknowledged the challenges faced by the commission in promoting the right to information due to a lack of public awareness. 
However, Dr Ali also highlighted recent progress, including the appointment of 19 out of 56 designated public information officers and the successful resolution of 48 out of 166 complaints received in the last five months. He added that they were also improving the website of Sindh information commission.
Dr Ali reiterated the commission’s commitment to promoting transparency and accountability in government and pledged its support to citizens seeking information. 
Chief information commissioner of Punjab Mahboob Qadir Shah put special emphasis on the establishment of websites to ensure proactive disclosure of information as per the Right to Information Act.
Moreover, the information commissioners also shared their progress and initiatives to implement RTI laws. Issues such as non-allocation of funds, delay in appointment of information commissioners, lack of administrative support from government, delay in finalising the working rules and subsequent shortage of staff, resistance in disclosing information and colonial mindset of public bodies were discussed at length.
During the interactive session, former senator Farhatullah Babar emphasised the critical role of information commissions in upholding democracy in Pakistan.
He proposed incentivizing the use of RTI to encourage greater participation from the public, and called for fully functional information commissions. He noted the irony that while the parliament passed the RTI law, it attempted to exclude itself from its scope. He further recommended that government departments should prioritise proactive disclosure of information.
