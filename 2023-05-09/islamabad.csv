1,"In a first, CDA to launch Rs10 billion projects in Islamabad's rural areas",Tender called for award of contracts to rehabilitate roads worth Rs2.8 billion.,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) while expanding its scope of work is going to launch mega development projects in rural areas and has called bids in this regard.
The engineering wing has called tenders from construction firms to award contracts of 17 projects worth Rs2.8 billion in the first phase of the total Rs10 billion projects for rural areas.
The 17 projects are supposed to be completed in three month as sources said the government wanted early and timely completion of all the development works in Islamabad.
According to the tender documents, the CDA will carry out rehabilitation and upgradation work on Shah Allah Ditta road up to Alexander Well with Rs380 million estimated cost while rehabilitation of the main Golra Road will be carried out at a cost of Rs144 million and that of Jodh and Sarai Kharboza road with an estimated cost of Rs135 million. 
Under another project worth Rs130 million, roads in Golra, Sangjani and other areas will be rehabilitated. 

Tender called for award of contracts to rehabilitate roads worth Rs2.8 billion

Meanwhile, the rehabilitation of Simly Dam road, Sewer and Jandghand roads will be done with an estimated cost of Rs120 million. Similarly, a project worth Rs141 million for rehabilitation of roads in Gokina, Mandla and Bari Imam, Sanjalian and Banigala will also be carried out.
Through a project of Rs160 million, Phulgran and Sakreela and Member roads will be rehabilitated while Rs151 million will be spent on the construction of Naiabadi to Huzaifa Town road and internal roads of Bhara Kahu and Malpur. 
The rehabilitation of Sihala Japan road and other schemes for Khana, Golra Mast and other rural areas are also included in the tender documents.
“We took ICT’s local department on board for these projects; they helped us and identified the areas, towns and roads. We then prepared PC-I and now our advertisement will be published for calling tenders,” said CDA’s director work Tahir Mahmood. He said the schemes had equally been distributed among all union councils. 
Asked about the bid documents which focused on road works, he said: “Besides roads, streets work is also included and soon another tender will be called in the second phase.” 
Traditionally, the CDA used to carry out development work only in urban areas and on some occasions it constructed roads in rural areas as well. 
Islamabad’s local government department, which falls under the administrative control of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration, used to do development work in rural areas.
However, for the first time in the history of the CDA it is going to start development works in Union Councils in all three constituencies of Islamabad. 
In February this year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at a meeting had given the go-ahead signal to the CDA to carry out mega development projects worth Rs10 billion in rural areas.
However, PML-N Secretary General NA-53 Sardar Mehtab Advocate said these projects had nothing to do with politics and upcoming elections rather the CDA is going to carry out due work in rural areas. 
Mr Mehtab, who is also a former additional legal adviser to the CDA, said according to CDA Ordinance 1960 the civic agency was supposed to do development projects in entire Islamabad. 
“Regardless of party affiliation, people of rural areas deserve provision of all basic facilities and there should be no urban and rural divide,” he said.
Last year, the CDA had showed its willingness to carry out development work in the rural areas, and a proposal in this regard was taken up by the CDA’s Development Working Party (DWP). However, the matter was deferred as the federal government’s approval was required. 
The prime minister finally gave the go-ahead to the CDA to initiate development work in the rural areas in February.
According to a press release issued by the PM Office in February, when Prime Minister Sharif was informed that the CDA had earmarked Rs10 billion for the rural areas. The prime minister was told that the fund would be utilised on solid waste management projects, sewerage system, construction of roads, repair work and on schemes related to public transport.

3,PTI plans public gatherings in all Islamabad UCs on 14th,PTI Islamabad region president has formally written a letter to the deputy commissioner seeking permission.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-lnsaf (PTI) has decided to hold public meetings in all the 101 union councils of Islamabad on May 14 on the call of PTI ChairmanImran Khan to express solidarity with the constitution, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial and the Supreme Court.
PTI Islamabad region President Ali Nawaz Awan has formally written a letter to Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon seeking permission to hold the ‘peaceful assembly’ in the capital.
He said PTI would organise peaceful gatherings at 101 designated places to express solidarity with the constitution, CJP and the judiciary at 4pm on May 14.
He stated that the constitution provided every citizen fundamental rights of freedom of movement, assembly, speech and freedom of association as envisaged under Article 15, 16, 17 and 19.
The letter reads: “SC and the Islamabad High Court have also settled that the Civil Administration shall administer in such a manner that no fundamental right of any citizen shall infringe as a result of the acts of their good office(s).”

Demands removal of police chief

It added: “IHC recently held that the fundamental rights under Articles 15, 16, 17 and 19 of the Constitution of the petitioner i.e. PTI were involved and also ordered that the same shall not be prejudiced at the hands of the respondent i.e. your office.”
Mr Awan said PTI had managed protests, rallies and peaceful assemblies at various locations of Islamabad during the last one year during which not even once a single pot was broken.
He said PTI Islamabad had full right to hold public gatherings in support of the constitution, CJP and the apex court.
In view of the supremacy of the constitution, he requested that the Islamabad administration should make necessary security arrangements for these public gatherings.
While talking to Dawn, Mr Awan claimed that despite seeking approval from the IHC the district administration had not allowed the PTI to hold rallies and dozens of workers were arrested on May 6.
“We had sought approval [for the rally] from IHC judge Babar Sattar…but the government did not accept the court orders. Now we have submitted an application to the district administration,” he said.
Meanwhile, PTI leaders on Monday demanded the removal of Inspector General (IG) Dr Akbar Nasir Khan, claiming the Islamabad police “dragged and detained” women supporters of the party as well as innocent children during a rally held to show solidarity with the judiciary on Saturday.
In a press conference held in the federal capital by Shireen Mazari and Ali Nawaz Awan, the party also urged the United Nations human rights organisations to take notice of the gross violations of human rights by the capital police.
Ms Mazari said that international human rights bodies should take notice of the “barbarism” on PTI women unleashed by the Islamabad police. She made it clear that they would not tolerate this “fascism anymore”.
She went on to say that the Constitution was virtually dysfunctional since the ouster of the PTI government and claimed that the laws were being flouted and openly violated during the last year. She said that Pakistan was a member of seven conventions, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention Against Torture and added that violence against peaceful protesters and detainees was a clear violation of these agreements.
She said that the deputy commissioner, Irfan Nawaz Memon, also committed contempt of court, as Islamabad High Court judge Babar Sattar gave clear instructions to the admin to permit the PTI to hold a peaceful protest, but the party was denied its fundamental and constitutional rights.
Ms Mazari reiterated that peaceful gathering was their constitutional and fundamental right but raids were carried out by unknown persons in civilian clothes without any warrants in a bid to intimidate and terrify the party workers. However, she made it clear that all such tactics would not work and they would not remain silent on this anymore.
‘Over 1300 booked’
Speaking on the occasion, Ali Nawaz Awan said that PTI workers were detained without warrants before the solidarity rally on Saturday. He said that two PTI women were waiting on a footpath to welcome the PTI rally outside F-9 Park but they were detained and tortured by police.
The PTI Islamabad president stated that during the last year, the Islamabad police “crossed all limits of cruelties”, as the IG Islamabad was specially called in from Lahore for this purpose and the situation was in front of everyone. He said that FIRs were lodged against 1,350 PTI supporters and several people were arrested during the last year, adding that arrests were being made without search warrants.
He alleged that a total of 61 people were arrested on May 6, and 509 people were detained on March 18 which was the reason the IG was awarded Tamgha-i-Shujaat. Mr Awan also called out the Islamabad police for poor policing and said vehicles worth Rs1.5 billion were stolen from the capital in one year while the police were busy repressing the PTI. At least six people were killed in one month while the land mafia claimed 50 lives in a year. “We don’t want IG police like Nasir in Islamabad,” he added. Ali Nawaz Awan announced that the PTI would take out peaceful rallies again on May 14 to express solidarity with the Supreme Court.
Speaking on the occasion, Shomaila and Mehwish – PTI women activists who were arrested from the rally – told the media that they were mistreated and manhandled by the police officials.

9,Thalassaemia patients to be thoroughly facilitated: Pims head,"Walk to raise awareness about disease organised; screening, tests of children to be done free-of-cost next week","ISLAMABAD: Walks were held on Monday at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) and F-9 Park to observe World Thalassaemia and Red Cross/Red Crescent Days.
Pims Executive Director Dr Rana Imran Sikandar said that all possible facilities would be provided to children suffering from the disease. In charge of the blood bank Dr Farwa Sajeel said that staff of the blood bank will take all possible steps to ensure timely supply of blood to children.
Another speaker, Tanveer Noshahi, said children, suffering from thalassaemia deserved attention of the whole society.
It is worth mentioning that according to estimates, over 100,000 thalassaemia major patients exist in the country. There are three types of thalassaemia: minor, major and intermedia. Persons with thalassaemia major suffer all their life and patients with thalassaemia intermedia can get thalassaemia major any time whereas persons with thalassaemia minor live normally but still carry the virus of the disease and can transmit it to their offspring.

Walk to raise awareness about disease organised; screening, tests of children to be done free-of-cost next week

Due to the disease, the body stops making red blood cells due to which blood is given to the patients. The only cure for it is a bone marrow transplant which is not only very expensive but requires a donor. The disease can be detected with a simple blood test and patients have to take medicines worth thousands of rupees and blood once and sometimes twice a month.
World Red Cross Red Crescent Day
The Pakistan Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) jointly organised an awareness walk at F-9 Park on Monday in connection with Red Cross Red Crescent Day celebrations under the theme ‘Everything we do comes #fromtheheart’.
The walk was aimed at raising public awareness about the humanitarian work carried out by PRCS and the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement partners in Pakistan.
The event was attended by PRCS Secretary General Mohammad Abaidullah Khan, staff from PRCS, ICRC and other partners in Pakistan including the Turkish Red Crescent, Norwegian Red Cross, and German Red Cross, as well as volunteers, students, and people from different walks of life.
The participants carried banners and placards with messages highlighting the importance of humanitarian work. A cake-cutting ceremony was also held to mark celebrations.
PRCS Chairman Sardar Shahid Ahmed Laghari said that in Pakistan, organisations continued to face numerous humanitarian challenges, from natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods to conflict-induced displacement and food insecurity and in such difficult times, PRCS, along with its partners, has remained steadfast in its commitment towards providing essential humanitarian assistance to those in need.
“Let us continue to work together, from the heart, towards a more just and equitable world,” he said.
Rawalpindi
The Punjab caretaker government will provide all medical facilities to thalassaemia patients and in this regard, the screening of children and all tests will be done free-of-cost next week and 100 percent treatment will be ensured along with vaccination of sick children. 
This was stated by Punjab caretaker Minister Dr Jamal Nasir while speaking as a special guest at the event organised by the Thalassaemia Welfare Society.

The association held an emergency meeting here with vice chairman Khawaja Mohammad Imran in the chair and noted that three weeks had passed but the food department had yet to release the susidised wheat stock.” “As a result around 95pc flour mills in the region were currently not operational.”
Since, the Potohar was not a prime wheat growing area compared to vast plains of Southern and Central Punjab, wheat is largely imported from other districts to this region to feed the growing urban population in here.

The meeting was informed that since the devolution, both the Punjab and Sindh provinces have refused to accept EOBI as a federal subject and that is why its members have not been replaced in all these years.
After the passage of Eighteenth Amendment Act, 2010, EOBI was supposed to be devolved to provinces like many other ministries, departments, institutions.
But it could not be devolved due to differences amongst provinces over its devolution. 
The two smaller provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa opposed its devolution whereas Sindh and Punjab want it transferred to provinces. Now, as EOBI remains a federal subject, the two provinces Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have accepted it but the other two provinces have refused to accept this decision.
Senator Shahadat Awan raised the issue and asked why the members of EOBI Board have not been changed since 2013.  In reply, it was informed that since the devolution, both the Punjab and Sindh provinces have refused to accept EOBI as a federal subject and that is why its members have not been replaced in all these years.
The Committee was briefed by Chairperson Employees Old Age Benefits Institution (EOBI) Naheed Shah Durrani regarding the role and working of the institution. 
She apprised that EOBI is a leading institution which provides social security to its citizens to enhance the quality of their lives. She informed that EOBI has received a contribution of Rs180 billion during the last ten years. Moreover, during the financial year 2022-23, EOBI is expected to receive a contribution of Rs38 billion against an approved target of Rs33 billion, she added.
However, despite the importance of EOBI, no attention has been given over strengthening the administrative structure and Board of EOBI, she stated.
The meeting was attended by Senator Manzoor Ahmed Kakar, State Minister for Law and Justice Senator Shahadat Awan, Senator Shaheen Khalid Butt, Senator Muhammad Asad Ali Khan Junejo, Senator Prince Ahmed Omer Ahmed Zai and other senior officers of the relevant departments.
