Haji Aurangzaib Butt, a local leader of the PML-N and a businessman, told Dawn over telephone that he had initially received a message to pay the extortion money and later received a letter (on the letterhead of the banned outfit), as well as threatening phone calls from a number with the dialing code of a neighbouring country.  
He said the caller, a man speaking Urdu language in Pakhtun accent, demanded Rs100m from him and threatened to kill or kidnap his son if he failed to pay the extortion money. He claimed he brought the matter into the notice of the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and beefed up his security.
However, a spokesman for Gujrat police said Mr Butt did not lodged any written complaint so far for the registration of a case.
Official sources say that before Mr Butt, a religious figure in the district belonging to a sectarian organisation, had also received such a threatening letter and call by the banned outfit and was asked to pay extortion money.
They said the LEAs and intelligence agencies have launched probes into the matter.
The sources say a close relative of a former PTI lawmaker from Hafizabad district had also received such threats last week, allegedly by the same banned outfit.

1,"IGP orders removal of ‘unauthorised’police check posts, lock-ups",Fresh guidelines for establishing lock-up at chowkis issued,"LAHORE: Punjab IG Dr Usman Anwar has ordered immediate dismantling of all the ‘unauthorised’ police posts (chowkis) across the province following reports that police were using a majority of them for corrupt practices.
He also ordered the removal of all ‘illegal’ lock-ups from these police posts besides putting a complete ban on conducting investigation into cases at the posts.
There were reports that the police officials were using the posts in-question for allegedly illegal detention of suspects, extortion, torture and other criminal activities.  
Similarly, it was reported that many political elites were also using them through the local police to ‘teach a lesson’ to their opponents.
An official said the matter of illegal practices was brought into the notice of the Inspector General of Police (IGP) during a meeting held at the Central Police Office here the other day.

Fresh guidelines for establishing lock-up at chowkis issued 

He was briefed that many police officials were using these posts (chowkis) for ‘ulterior motives.’
These ‘illegal’ check posts were established by the police without seeking approval from the competent authorities, the meeting was informed.
The official said it shocked the participants when they were specifically informed that these posts were largely used for illegal detention of the suspects, ‘third degree’ torture, extortion and other such corrupt practices.
Following the information, the IG issued an official letter addressing all the regional, city and district police officers and directing them to abolish all the ‘unauthorised’ police posts across the province.
“The IG Punjab has ordered immediate abolition of all unauthorised police posts (chowkiat) of the province, as most of them remain unsupervised by officers and are being used for corrupt practices,” reads the official letter issued on Sunday.
It stated that the Punjab police chief set the May 8 (Monday) deadline for ensuring implementation of the above orders in letter and spirit.
“In case you have good reasons for not abolishing the police posts, it may continue after approval of the RPO concerned and the IG police Punjab”, reads the letter.
The approval must be obtained no later than Tuesday (May 9), it stated adding that no police post shall operate in any part of the province without the mandatory requirements.  
In order to run the police posts (chowkis), the letter directed the RPOs, DPOs and other police officers to establish front desks and install closed circuit TV cameras at all the posts.
Similarly, it said under a new policy there should be no lock-up in any police post except where the respective police station is 50 kilometers away.  
The lock-up should be monitored by the CCTVs and authorised by the RPO concerned under intimation to the Punjab police chief, reads the letter.  
It stated that the prime role of establishing the [authorised] police posts was to prevent crime, arrest hardened criminals including proclaimed offenders, court absconders and to respond to the incidents besides other routine matters.
“In future all arrests must be made, investigated and conducted at the police stations”, the letter said.  
The IG has further directed the RPOs and other field police officers to complete the installation of cameras and front desks at the authorised check posts by Wednesday till (tomorrow).

4,Attacks on police: LHC larger bench seeks JIT’s report,The bench observes that the police are free to hold investigation as per the law.,"LAHORE: A Lahore High Court full bench on Monday directed the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to submit its report on the investigation into the cases of violence and attacks on police teams outside Zaman Park.
Headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, the bench was hearing a petition of former prime minister Imran Khan seeking quashment of as many as 121 criminal cases registered against him.
Justice Aalia Neelum, Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh, Justice Anwarul Haq Pannun and Justice Muhammad Amjad Rafiq are the other members of the bench.
An additional advocate general stated that the JIT members had visited Zaman Park to record the statement of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan, who was a suspect in the cases.
He said it was not a good practice as in future people would ask police to visit their place to record statement.
The bench observed that whatever was happening was not good in fact.
Justice Pannun reminded the law officer that the government should not indulge in point-scoring as it was not like that one side was an angel and the other was devil.
The law officer said the JIT could summon the suspects again if required.
The bench observed that the police were free to hold investigation as per the law.
The bench adjourned further hearing till May 19 and directed the government to submit the progress report of the JIT with complete details of the cases against the petitioner.
The bench also issued notices to the government and the police on an application of Imran Khan seeking permission to appear in these cases through video-link facility.
The application said a plethora of `false` cases had been registered against the PTI chief and he was required to appear repeatedly before various judicial forums to defend himself.
It said on each occasion of his appearance before a judicial forum, he faces a serious threat to his life due to the lack of security being provided to him despite his entitlement as a former prime minister.
The applicant asked the court to allow him to participate and appear in all cases against him within the jurisdiction of the LHC through video link with the aid of modern and scientific devices in the interest of justice.

Justice Shahid Jamil Khan was hearing a petition filed by PU Assistant Professor Khurram Shahzad alleging corruption of billions of rupees in PU Employees Housing Scheme commonly known as Town–III.
Petitioner’s counsel Shahbaz Bokhari contended that the housing scheme was launched in 2016 under the supervision of the PU administration. He said the professors and the employees of the university purchased plots in the society due to the goodwill of the management committee comprising professors.
He said the committee failed to start development work in the scheme despite the lapse of over six years.
The counsel pointed out that an inquiry conducted by the Anti-Corruption Establishment also found corruption in the affairs of the management committee headed by its secretary Prof Azhar Naeem.
He asked the court to direct the LDA to take immediate action regarding approval, regularisation and development work of the Town-III and also order the PU VC to initiate a transparent process to start development work under his supervision.
Justice Khan directed the respondents to submit detailed replies within a fortnight.

6,Dr Qadeer’s daughter laments corruption in projects launched in her father’s name,Dr Dina Khan hopes Faisalabad's business community would cooperate with her for completion of projects launched by Dr AQ Khan Foundation.,"TOBA TEK SINGH: Dr Dina Khan, the daughter of the late nuclear scientist and chairperson of the Dr AQ Khan Foundation, has said she was shocked to know the quantum of corruption in the social welfare projects initiated in the name of her late father, and has now practically taken control of these projects.  
She was addressing the business community at the Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FCCI) on Monday.  
She said Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan was a legend, who not only made Pakistan’s defence impregnable, but also launched health and education projects to help the country’s youth to play a leading role at the global level as proud Pakistanis.  
She hoped the business community of Faisalabad would cooperate with her for completion of the projects launched by the foundation. 
She said that people are aware of her late father’s efforts for the promotion of education, but few of them know that he also established a hospital in Lahore under the foundation in 2015.  
She was critical of the elements who, she said, were getting funding posing themselves as owners of the hospital and transferring this money abroad.  
“I am fighting against this mafia”, she said and added that her father wanted to convert Pakistan into a ‘centre of excellence’.  
She said her late father was fully aware of the importance of education and that is why he focused his full attention on the promotion of education in emerging sciences and technologies.  
“Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan launched educational scholarships, but he had no money,”she said and added that her uncle provided him with a sufficient amount to offer scholarships to the talented and deserving students.  
Dr Dina said Dr Abdul Qadeer’s mission was to make Pakistan a great country. “Although it was a daunting challenge, he continued his efforts to promote education at the grassroots level to achieve this objective,” she said and added that he established the foundation to undertake health and education-related projects.  
Dr Dina said that in collaboration with local and international academicians a new educational module would be introduced in the country with a focus on the promotion of engineering and Artificial Intelligence (AI).  
She said that she would need cooperation and support from the business community to achieve the ultimate objectives of her late father.  
She nominated Mian Muhammad Tayyab as her focal person in Faisalabad. 
FCCI President Dr Khurram Tariq said Dr AQ Khan was a legend and every Pakistani is proud of his contribution toward defence, education and health sectors.  
Dr Sajjad Arshad, the chamber’s senior vice president and Haji Muhammad Aslam Bhalli vice president, Rubina Amjad president Faisalabad Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FECCI), Engineer Ahmad Hassan, Haji Gulzar Ahmad, Mian Abdul Waheed, Rana Fayyaz Ahmad and other executive members also spoke.  
Former senior vice president of the FCCI, Chaudhry Talat Mahmood announced a donation of Rs100,000 for the foundation on behalf of Rana Fayyaz of local jewellers’ association.

The Punjab University Department of History and Pakistan Studies organised the three-day international conference on ‘Central and South Asia Re-connected’ at Al Raazi Hall.
Kazakhstan’s Ambassador to Pakistan Yerzan Kistifan said that South and Central Asian countries should work together to increase trade, cultural, religious, and historical ties for the development of the region.
He noted that Kazakhstan and Pakistan have historical relations and that both countries are culturally connected. He emphasized that Kazakhstan wants to strengthen relations with South Asian countries at all levels for the sake of the region. 
He also said that by learning lessons from history and benefiting from each other’s knowledge and experiences, we can move forward.
Mr Kistifan added that Central Asia is moving in the right direction and its future is bright, but peace in Afghanistan is necessary for the region. 
He also mentioned that the war between Russia and Ukraine is damaging the world, and Ukraine is a big country for wheat production. 
He stressed that countries should not rely on others for their development, peace, and prosperity and that peaceful diplomatic talks are the need of the hour.
The Punjab Higher Education Commission chairperson, Dr Shahid Munir, spoke about how Central and South Asia are home to a diverse array of cultures, languages, and histories, and how regional connectivity is crucial to unlocking the potential of this diverse and dynamic region.

Dr Munir also noted that by connecting businesses and markets, new opportunities for trade and investment can be unlocked, creating new jobs and economic growth. 
He highlighted the construction of the TAPI gas pipeline, which will link Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, as well as the development of new highways, railways, and ports as opportunities for trade, investment, and tourism.
