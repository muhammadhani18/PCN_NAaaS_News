Arif Habib Ltd said the benchmark index of the bourse lost 474.53 points in intraday trading owing to the negative news flow regarding the revival of the International Monetary Fund loan programme.
The negative trigger created disappointment among investors who resorted to profit-selling across the board.

Trading volumes remained reasonable, with third-tier equities continuing to lead the volume board.

The overall trading volume increased 0.5pc to 179.1 million shares. The traded value went down 17.5pc to $16.8m on a day-on-day basis.

1,Hascol not compliant with PSX regulations,Hascol has been in trouble since 2018 partly for making inaccurate entries in its financial accounts.,"KARACHI: The Pakis­tan Stock Exchange (PSX) told investors on Monday that Hascol Petroleum Ltd, an oil marketing company, is in non-compliance for failing to hold its annual general meeting besides not submitting its annual audited financial statements for 2022.
However, the company’s shares are already quoted in the defaulters’ segment on account of its non-compliance with a separate regulation i.e. its statutory auditor has issued a qualified opinion on the going concern assumption, has issued a disclaimer, or an adverse opinion in the audit report.
Hascol has been in trouble since 2018 partly for making inaccurate entries in its financial accounts. It’s been in negotiation with all its lenders to restructure its entire debt of Rs54 billion. It’s now in the middle of seeking approval from creditors for its plan to rehabilitate the company through “restructuring/rescheduling, settlement and repayment” of financial obligations.
The company has designed a restructuring scheme that entails the settlement of the full amount to the satisfaction of lenders. It filed a scheme of arrangement with the Sindh High Court, which ordered it in November 2022 to convene meetings with banks for their approval.
Hascol Petroleum was supposed to reconvene the creditors’ meeting in the first week of April to present the modified scheme to its secured creditors for necessary approvals. But it postponed last month a previously adjourned meeting of its creditors, saying they required “additional time” to review the proposed scheme of arrangement and seek internal approvals.

3,ECC okays Rs34bn grants to secure $50m WB tranche,Fixes prices of four new cardiac stents.,"ISLAMABAD: A few weeks before the next fiscal year’s budget, the government on Monday approved about Rs34.4 billion worth of supplementary grants mostly to secure World Bank loans and set maximum retail price (MRPs) of four newly registered categories of cardiac stents.
The decisions were taken at a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, which also allowed expansion in the exploration licence area and extension in the well testing period to Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL) and United Energy Pakistan Ltd (UEPL), respectively.
The meeting approved a Rs13.2bn supplementary grant, equivalent to $50 million to be obtained from the World Bank as the first tranche of a $85m credit line, to Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Company Ltd (PMRCL) set up in June 2018 as a joint venture of nine local banks and International Finance Corporation (IFC) — a commercial arm of the WB. 
The PMRCL is aimed to provide medium to long-term funding to primary mortgage lenders by raising from the capital debt market at cheaper rates.

Fixes prices of four new cardiac stents

The federal government owns 28.86pc of the company while the remaining 71.14pc shares are held by the National Bank of Pakistan, Habib Bank, United Bank, IFC, Askari Bank, Bank Alfalah, Bank Al-Habib, House Building Finance Corporation and Summit Bank for which the World Bank extended $140m credit line to the government in 2018 at 3pc interest rate.
The ECC also approved another Rs7.84bn supplementary grant as rupee cover against another World Bank loan for Financial Inclusion and Infrastructure Project (FIIP). The WB had approved $137m for the 5-year project in 2017 but the project, operated by the State Bank of Pakistan, suffered delays and cost overruns. 
The World Bank agreed to extend the loan until June 2025. The ECC approved the supplementary grant, otherwise, Pakistan was required to return $33m to the World Bank immediately, because of non-utilisation.
On the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), the ECC approved Rs8.4bn additional funds to meet its expenditures arising out of exchange rate losses from Rs186 per dollar at the time of budget allocation last year to Rs288 per dollar at present. 
The ECC also approved another Rs5bn supplementary grant to the Ministry of Housing and Works for the execution of development schemes of erstwhile Fata out of a 10-year accelerated development plan.

On the recommendation of the National Price Fixing Committee for life-saving medical services, the ECC also approved the maximum retail price (MRP) of four newly registered cardiac stents including two of US origin, one of Japan and another of Turkiye and Italy.
Under the decision, the MRP of Promus PREMIER Select Monorail Coronary stent and DESyne X2 NECSS of US origin were fixed at Rs58,765 per piece and Rs72,450 per piece, respectively.

The ECC also grant an additional (free) area of 15.88 sq km in Soghri Exploration Licence to state-run OGDCL to drill an exploratory well close to its existing exploration area on the basis that a geological structure was extending into a free area in the northern part of Soghri Exploration Lease.
The committee also granted a six-month extension to UEPL for Extended Well Testing over Qabul-2 St-1 discovery in Khipro Exploration License with effect from Feb 22, 2023.

4,Punjab plans cotton revival to cut imports,The provincial govt has decided to provide irrigation water to cotton fields to achieve this season's production target.,"LAHORE: Buoyant by the good wheat harvest, the government has decided to focus on the white lint to revive the most important cash crop of the Kharif season and subsequently the textile industry for reducing its import bill. 
The Punjab government has decided to provide irrigation water to cotton fields as a priority for achieving the over 8.2 million bales production target this season. 
Agriculture Secretary Iftikhar Ali Sahoo met Irrigation Secretary Wasif Khurshid in the latter’s office on Monday to discuss a plan for ensuring water supplies in the canals of south Punjab during the ongoing cotton cultivation. 
Director-General Agriculture (Extension) Dr Muhammad Anjum Ali, Chief Engineer Habibullah Bodla and Deputy Director Muhammad Adeel were also present. 
Mr Khurshid said that the irrigation department is providing south Punjab more water than its share on a priority basis so that cotton may be sown in the maximum area. 
He said that the Punjab irrigation department is facing a total shortage of over 27 per cent in the system this year but the south Punjab canals are being supplied 53,000 cusecs of water against its share of 45,000 cusecs. 
Mr Sahoo said that cotton is being cultivated on an area of 4.554 million acres in south Punjab which is 91pc of the total target for the province. 
He said that water supplies are essential to achieve the target of cotton cultivation. 
The meeting participants agreed on joint monitoring of the officers of the agriculture and irrigation department regarding the availability of water during the cotton season, immediate reporting of incidents of water theft and action against the perpetrators as per law to ensure uniform and uninterrupted supply of canal water to the farmers in south Punjab. 
The provincial government has devised the Cotton Action Plan 2023-24 to what it claims will earn $3bn in foreign exchange. The district administration, agriculture department and other stakeholders are working together on the challenging task of increasing the area under cotton cultivation which has been on the decline for the last many years because of repeated failures of the crop for various reasons. 
Mr Sahoo has directed the extension and pest warning wings’ field staff to provide technical guidance and support to the farmers and compile the data of all the farmers. 
To encourage cotton cultivation, the government has also announced holding a cotton production competition among the farmers in which those harvesting an outstanding crop will be awarded cash prizes worth millions of rupees at provincial and district levels.

5,NSS profit rates revised up,KARACHI: The government has increased the profit rates of the National Savings Schemes (NSS) in the wake of the...,"KARACHI: The government has increased the profit rates of the National Savings Schemes (NSS) in the wake of the record record-high interest rate to tame unprecedented inflation.
The new rates will take effect from May 9. The details show that the NSS rate on three-month certificates was increased by 92 basis points to 20.84pc. This is just close to the SBP’s policy interest rate of 21pc. The government is borrowing through treasury bills at 21.99pc.
For six-month certificates, the rate was increased by 118bps to 20.82pc while for one-year maturity the rate was revised upward by 98bps to 20.80pc. There has been a demand for increasing the profit rates since the inflation exceeded 36pc in April.
Further details show that the Saving Accounts rate was revised up by 100bps to 19.50pc.
The saving certificates average rate was increased by 27bps to 17.40pc while Bahbood, Shuhda and pension rates were kept unchanged at 16.56pc.
A tweet from National Savings on Monday said the new rates would be effective from Tuesday (May 9).
Sources in the banking sector said that it was the first relief for the people before the upcoming budget as the government is walking on a tightrope. The IMF has been keenly watching the development regarding the new budget which would be an election budget. 
The PDM government which could not control inflation and boost economic activities is facing a tough time and is willing to provide some relief to the general public.
However, due to a shortage of revenue and record-high inflation along with poor foreign exchange reserves, the government is unable to ignore the IMF’s advice for the budget.
The IMF has once again asked the government to increase the interest rate for taming the unprecedented inflation. 
The aggressive interest rate hikes since the start of the current fiscal year have failed to check inflation and slowed down economic activities due to the high cost of borrowing and price spirals pushed up production costs.

6,Auto financing drops for ninth month,"The interest rate has now tripled to 21pc, compared to 7pc in March 2020.","KARACHI: The outstanding auto financing continued its downward trend for the ninth month in a row, plunging almost 12.83 per cent to Rs317 billion in March from Rs363.55bn in the same month last year.
It witnessed a 2.74pc drop as compared to Rs325.86bn in February, data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) showed on Monday.
Phenomenal hikes in interest rates, soaring automobile prices, frequent plant shutdowns leading to delays in vehicle delivery, escalating petroleum costs and various measures by the central bank have collectively contributed to slowing down the pace of auto financing.
The interest rate has now tripled to 21pc, compared to 7pc in March 2020.
Fahad Rauf, Head of Research at Ismail Iqbal Securities, said auto financing is not viable due to high-interest rates and various restrictions by the SBP.
“I think the share of auto financing in total car sales is now almost zero as compared to 30-40pc previously,” he said.
Fahad said sales of vehicles through bank financing may remain under pressure as long as the interest rates and inflation remain high. However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is forcing the government to raise the interest rate to 25pc, which would further shrink auto sales, he added.
Suzuki bike price
In a surprise move, Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL) increased the prices of two-wheelers despite the suspension of production from May 2-9.
As per the circular issued to the authorised dealers, the new rates of Suzuki GD110S, GS150, GSX125 and GR150 will be Rs335,000, Rs364,000, Rs488,000 and Rs521,000 from Tuesday as compared to Rs322,000, Rs350,000, Rs469,000 and Rs501,000, respectively.
Pak Suzuki’s faced only a 3pc sales drop to 26,935 units in 9MYF23 from 27,693 units in the same period last fiscal year, while sales of other assemblers fell by 24-77pc in the above period.
Gold’s new peak
Local gold rates continued a bullish trend on Monday hitting an all-time high at Rs226,900 per tola and Rs194,530 per 10-gram, up Rs1,400 and Rs1,200, respectively, from Saturday.
According to the All Sindh Saraf Jewellers Association, the world gold price soared by $5 per ounce to $2,022.
