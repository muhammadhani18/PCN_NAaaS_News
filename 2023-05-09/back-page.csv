0,Muttaqi wants talks with TTP revived,"Afghan FM says economic ties suffered due to political, security issues"," 

Mawlawi Amir Muttaqi

ISLAMABAD: Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi on Monday called for revival of talks between Pakistan and outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denying that the TTP is using Afghan soil to carry out attacks in the neighbouring country.
“As for Pakistan’s security concerns, we ask that the government of Pakistan and the TTP sit together and find a solution to these problems on their own,” said FM Muttaqi while delivering a lecture at the Institute of Strategic Studies on the last day of his four-day visit to Pakistan.
He hoped the problems would be solved through dialogue, turning the challenges into opportunities, efforts to boost trade and economic cooperation between the two nations. He said the Afghan government managed to double trade with Pakistan from US$1.1bn to $2.4bn in past one year and hoped to boost it over $5bn.
The remarks came amid a spike in terrorist attacks in Pakistan, majority of which have been claimed by banned outfits including TTP. This surge in terror attacks was seen after Kabul-hosted talks between the TTP and the Pakistan government collapsed, resulting in an end to the ceasefire in November 2022.

Afghan FM says economic ties suffered due to political, security issues

Answering a volley of questions about the TTP, which is seen as one of the main perpetrators of recent terror attacks in Pakistan, Mr Muttaqi denied that the TTP was using Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. “The Islamic Emirate has fulfilled its responsibility. The IEA (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) was able to bring both sides to the table. We hosted the talks between Pakistan and the TTP,” he said.
In an apparent bid to absolve the Afghan Taliban — which came to power in Kabul in 2021— from any responsibility regarding the TTP, he also argued the TTP was not a recent movement. He said Pakistan had admitted 80,000 Pakistanis had embraced martyrdom in past 20 years. “This is an old issue,” he said, while also assuring Pakistan that his government was making efforts to ensure peace in the region.
“We do not want the flames of war in our neighbouring country, Pak­istan. There should be no bloodshed in Pakistan. This is our official policy,” he asserted.
Sharing details about his visit, he said Islamabad and Kabul had discussed ways to make progress on security issues. “We have talked to Pakistani officials about this issue. We will keep on talking to Pakistan. It will be our request that problems should be resolved thro­ugh diplomatic channels and negotiations. There are hopes that the situation will further improve in the future,” he added.
 
 

About the Taliban government in Afghanistan, the minister said: “Our first order of business at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was to convey to the region and beyond, our desire to forge a new foreign policy based on cooperative dialogue and joint interactions. When it comes to Pakistan, our initial focus was on increasing economic ties, with economic connectivity and transit at its core.
“We are continuously striving to increase regional connectivity. From TAPI to CASA 1000 to TAP-500kV to Afghan-Trans railway and connecting South to Central Asia through Afghanistan, we continue to advocate for greater integration. We recently facilitated the transfer of gas from Turkmenistan to Pakistan, via Afghanistan, halving the distance previously traversed to reach Quetta to 900km. After this successful trial, we are committed to supporting this process as a permanent route that guarantees the interests of Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, and Pakistan,” he said.
The ties between Afghanistan and Pakistan were beyond the neighborhood, he added.
“For too long, the economic and people-to-people ties of the two countries have been sacrificed at the altar of political and security considerations, resulting in the loss of major opportunities,” he noted. He said the two nations have long been suffering from insecurity, economic stagnation, climate change, and others. He vowed to turn the problems into opportunities so that the economic relations could have a positive cascading impact on other spheres as well.

1,"Pakistan, China to bolster naval capabilities for regional security","The two militaries should “expand into new fields of cooperation” to safeguard the region’s security, says Chinese minister","BEIJING: Pakistan and China seek to expand their naval ties as the two sides look forward to enhancing capabilities and deepening cooperation to deal with regional security challenges.
This was agreed upon in a meeting between Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu and Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Amjad Khan Niazi on Monday.
The Chinese minister said the two militaries should “expand into new fields of cooperation” to safeguard the region’s security.
“The two militaries should expand into new areas of exchanges, create new high points of cooperation to continuously enhance their ability to deal with all sorts of risks and challenges, and jointly maintain the security interests of the two countries and of the region,” said Li, according to a statement on China’s Ministry of National Defense website.
Admiral Niazi’s visit to Beijing comes after Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of China’s Central Military Commission, said in late April that the Chinese military was willing to deepen and expand cooperation with Pakistan’s military.
The army, navy and air force of the two nations are already cooperating in several avenues and have held bilateral exercises in each other’s territory.
 
 

But Chinese interest in the region has stirred concern, especially in neighbouring India after China opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti on the northwestern fringe of the Indian Ocean in 2017. For China, Pakistan and its access to the Arabian Sea is key in the event of a maritime blockade in the Strait of Malacca.
The Pentagon previously identified Pakistan as a possible location for a future Chinese military base, with Gwadar seen as the likely location. Any sign of that happening would fuel New Delhi’s worries over growing Chinese military alliances and assets in its backyard.In 2022, New Delhi expressed concern over a Chinese survey ship’s visit to a strategic port in Sri Lanka.
In 2014, Sri Lanka angered India when a Chinese submarine and a warship were allowed to dock in Colombo.

2,2 blasts rock Amritsar’s Golden Temple within 36 hours,Punjab’s director general of police says a terrorism angle has not been ruled out.,"AMRITSAR: A second blast in 36 hours rocked the area around the Sikh holy site of the Golden Temple in India’s Amritsar city on Monday, police said.
Authorities said that one person was injured.
The previous blast late on Saturday night, which police said they were still investigating, also left at least one person wounded in the city, in the Sikh-majority northern state of Punjab.
Punjab’s director general of police said a terrorism angle had not been ruled out, and preliminary investigations suggested a crude device had been us­ed.

Two injured in attack on Sikh holy site

“Blast occurred when a thread was pulled accidentally by a passerby,” said Gaurav Yadav. “The container fell down and it went off.” The Golden Temple — a gleaming edifice in a large artificial pond — is revered by Sikhs the world over.
But it has been the scene of violence in the past, most notably when Indian special forces stormed it in 1984 to remove Sikh militants.
Devotees told AFP that officials arrived soon after the early morning blast on Monday — when hundreds of people would have been at the shrine — to collect forensic samples.
“Such happenings are creating panic,” said worshipper Jasbir Singh Patti, who visits the temple daily.
“It is time for the police administration to act swiftly to present the truth before the public.” Several windows cracked in the blast in the same area on Saturday — a day when around 200,000 people typically visit the site.
In March, a manhunt was launched in Punjab to arrest a firebrand Sikh separatist that sparked protests and vandalism among the diaspora.
It was unclear if the latest blasts were linked.
Thousands of officers were deployed in the northern state and mobile internet was cut off for days in the effort to locate Amritpal Singh, 30, who was arrested last month.
Singh rose to prominence calling for a separate Sikh homeland known as Khalistan, the struggle for which sparked deadly violence in India in the 1980s and 1990s.

3,Three dead as IAF jet crashes in Rajasthan,NEW DELHI: Three people on the ground died in India on Monday when a Russian-made MiG-21 military aircraft suffered...,"NEW DELHI: Three people on the ground died in India on Monday when a Russian-made MiG-21 military aircraft suffered an “onboard emergency” and crashed onto a house in the western state of Rajasthan, authorities said.
The Indian Air Force (IAF) said that the pilot ejected safely and the accident happened shortly after take-off in a routine training sortie.
The pilot “experienced an onboard emergency, following which he attempted to recover the aircraft as per existing procedures,” an IAF statement said.
“Having failed to do so, he initiated an ejection, sustaining minor injuries in the process,” it said.
“The IAF regrets the loss of lives and offers its deepest condolences to the bereaved families.
A Court of Inquiry has been constituted to ascertain the cause of the accident.”

4,SC disallows import of elephants for zoo,Rejects plea seeking approval for import of African elephants for a zoological garden in Peshawar.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a plea seeking an approval for import of African elephants for a zoological garden in Peshawar.
A three-judge SC bench comprising Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Shahid Wahid dismissed the plea.
During the hearing, Deputy Attorney General Raja Shafqat Abbasi, through a concise statement, cited a July 24, 2020 meeting of the CITES (Conve­ntion on International Trade in Endan­gered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Management Authority, in which it was held that zoo cannot provide an environment conducive to survival of the wild African elephants.
The court had taken up an appeal moved by a firm challenging the Sept 17, 2020 order of the Peshawar High Court, which had also dismissed the case. Filed through Advocate Niaz Wali Khan, the petitioner argued it had already purchased two elephants from the Zimbabwe government, besides bearing the cost of their food and upkeep, but was being denied permission to import them for the Peshawar Zoo.
The DAG recalled how the Ministry of Climate Change was earlier directed by the PHC to convene a meeting of the CITES Management Authority of Pakistan during the first round of litigation under Section 15 of the Pakistan Trade Control of Wild Fauna and Flora Act 2012 to assess whether the Peshawar Zoo was suitably equipped to house and care for elephants.
In compliance with the directive, a meeting was held on July 24, 2020 in which it was concluded that the zoo could not provide the required environment.
The petition, however, claimed that officials of the Zimbabwe Part Wildlife Department visited the Peshawar zoo, thoroughly inspected the site and found it conducive and favourable for the elephants.
Earlier in 2020, the Islamabad High Court had ordered relocation of Kaavan, an elephant, from Islamabad’s Marghazar Zoo due to the poor state of the facility.

5,Russia attacks Ukraine with huge drone swarm,Kyiv claims to have shot down all 60 drones,"

Lviv: Ukrainians decorate a ‘memory tree’ with paper red poppies on Monday at the site of a former prisoner of war camp in western Ukraine to mark the 78th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe.—AFP

 
KYIV: In what comes as the biggest drone swarm yet in a renewed Russian air campaign unleashed 10 days ago after a lull since early March, Russia attacked Ukraine with drones on Monday.
Explosions could be heard through the night in Kyiv. Three people were injured in blasts in the Solomyanskyi district and two when drone wreckage fell in the Sviatoshyn district, both west of the capital’s centre, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.
Kyiv’s military administration said drone wreckage crashed onto a runway at Zhuliany airport, one of the capital’s two passenger airports, drawing emergency services there, although there was no fire. Drone debris also damaged a two-storey building in the central Shevchenkivskyi district.
In Odesa, flames completely engulfed a large structure identified as a food warehouse in pictures posted on Telegram by Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa military administration.

Kyiv claims to have shot down all 60 drones

After air raid alerts blared for hours over roughly two-thirds of Ukraine, local media said explosions sounded in the southern region of Kherson and southeastern Zaporizhzhia.
Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in Zaporizhzhia, said Russian forces hit a warehouse and Ukrainian troops’ position in the small city of Orikhiv. Separately, Russian forces shelled eight spots in Sumy in northeastern Ukraine on Sunday, the regional military administration said in a Facebook post.
Strikes have also intensified in the past two weeks on Russian-held targets, especially in Crimea. Ukraine does not confirm any role in such attacks.
On Monday, Kyiv’s mayor claimed that Russia had fired 60 Iranian-made kamikaze drones at Ukrainian targets, including 36 at the capital, all of which had been shot down.
Victory Day
Kyiv said Moscow was also making a final push to try to capture the ruined eastern city of Bakhmut, to deliver President Vladimir Putin what would be his only prize for a costly Russian winter offensive, in time for Victory Day.
Moscow is preparing for Tuesday’s Victory Day parade, the most important day in the calendar for Russia under Putin, who uses the 1945 Soviet triumph over Nazi Germany to justify his invasion of Ukraine.
However, in a new break with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy marked Victory Day on Monday rather than Tuesday, announcing that he had signed a decree to change the date of the holiday in line with the practice of Western allies.
“Recalling the heroism of millions of Ukrainians in that war against Nazism, we see the same heroism in the actions of our soldiers today,” said Zelenskiy, who addressed the nation from a hilltop overlooking Kyiv.
Russia foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that by changing the date, Zelenskiy had betrayed the memory of Ukrainians who fought the Nazis.
