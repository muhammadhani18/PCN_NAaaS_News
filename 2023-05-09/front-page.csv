0,Imran’s ‘baseless allegations’ not acceptable: army,"ISPR says PTI chief has recourse to legal avenues, terms accusations part of ""sensational"" propaganda.","• ISPR says PTI chief has recourse to legal avenues, terms accusations part of ‘sensational’ propaganda
• Ex-PM asks ‘are military officers above the law’, accuses intelligence official of involvement in attempt on his life
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: The military on Monday warned the PTI chairman of legal action over “mala fide statements and propaganda” and advised him to “make a recourse to legal avenues” soon after Imran Khan once again accused a senior intelligence official of his involvement in the plot to assassinate the former prime minister.
In a statement issued in response to a series of tweets posted by Mr Khan wherein he lashed out at the government and the military, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) asked him to refrain from making accusations without evidence.
The army termed Mr Khan’s allegations against the ISI’s senior official “irresponsible and baseless”.
The statement said: “Chairman PTI has levelled highly irresponsible and baseless allegations against a serving senior military officer without any evidence. These fabricated and malicious allegations are extremely unfortunate, deplorable and unacceptable.”
The military’s media wing pointed out that his recent tweet was part of “sensational” and “consistent” propaganda.
The statement said, “This has been a consistent pattern for [the] last one year wherein military and intelligence agencies officials are targeted with insinuations and sensational propaganda for the furtherance of political objectives.”
The military hinted at taking legal action, as the statement warned: “We ask the political leader concerned to make a recourse to legal avenues and stop making false allegations. The institution reserves the right to take legal course of action against patently false and mala fide statements and propaganda.”
Mr Khan on May 3, while appearing in the Islamabad High Court, told reporters that a senior official — often dubbed by him as ‘Dirty Harry’ — of the premier spy agency had “planned to assassinate him twice”.
 


‘Above the law’
The scathing allegations by the former premier against the apex intelligence agency came in response to a statement by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wherein he accused the PTI chairman of maligning the military for personal gains.
“Imran Niazi’s act of routinely maligning and threatening Pakistan Army and intelligence agency for the sake of petty political gains is highly condemnable. His levelling of allegations without any proof against Gen Faisal Naseer and officers of our intelligence agency cannot be allowed and will not be tolerated,” the prime minister tweeted.
 






Shortly after the tweet, the PTI chairman in a tirade on Twitter accused the intelligence agency and its officials of planning to murder him.
“Have I, a citizen, the right to nominate those I feel were responsible for assassination attacks on me? Why was I denied my legal & Constitutional right to register an FIR,” said Mr Khan as he claimed to have “suffered two assassination attempts on his life in last few months”.
 






He asked whether the statement by PM Sharif meant that “military officials were above the law or they cannot commit a crime”.
“If we allege one of them has committed a crime, how is [the] institution being maligned?” he said, asking who was “so powerful as to sabotage” the Wazirabad joint investigation team even though the PTI was in power in Punjab. Last year, the PTI chairman survived an assassination bid in Wazirabad as he led a long march towards Islamabad.
In another question posed to PM Sharif, the PTI chairman asked, “Can SS answer why the ISI took over ICT Judicial Complex evening before my appearance there on 18 March? Why were ISI personnel in CTD & lawyers camouflaged? What was motive & what business did ISI have in the Complex?”
“When SS [Shehbaz Sharif] can truthfully answer these Qs, all will point to one powerful man & his accomplices all being above the law. Then it is time for us to officially declare that in Pakistan there is only law of the jungle where might is right,” the PTI chairman added.
After he survived the attack on his rally in Wazirabad in November last year, the PTI chairman accused PM Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, and a senior military official of planning the assassination bid. He had also nominated them in his case registered at the relevant police station, but the FIR did name the three officials.
Election schedule
Giving a schedule of his mass public meetings for the run-up to May 14 elections date and to express solidarity with the Supreme Court, Mr Khan said he had decided to go out on roads “despite verifiable threats to life”.
Separately, PTI President Chaudhry Parvez Elahi called on party Imran Khan at his Zaman Park residence to discuss the political situation in the country as well as the party’s strategy to sail through the constitutional crises.
Mr Elahi said that houses of his workers were being raided in Gujrat and they were being kidnapped and tortured in private penitentiaries. Imran Khan strongly condemned the raids and arrests of workers’ houses in Gujrat.
Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb asked Mr Khan to produce evidence either before police or courts instead of resorting to hurling allegations against others, APP adds. She said Mr Khan had a track record of levelling accusations against others, but he failed to produce evidence in every matter.

1,SC judges question govt’s obsession with full court,"PML-N says it’s not appropriate for ""selected"" bench to hear case on suo motu powers.","• PML-N says it’s not appropriate for ‘selected’ bench to hear case on suo motu powers
• AGP says copies of parliamentary proceedings may be furnished today
• PTI threatens high treason cases against caretaker govts
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday grilled the government regarding its insistence on the formation of full court to hear the case pertaining to suo motu powers of the chief justice, with Justice Ayesha A. Malik wondering whether the government intended to “get the benefit of the internal meetings of the judges” regarding the administrative affairs of the court.
During the hearing, the PML-N, in its plea submitted by lawyer Salahuddin Ahmed, asked the eight-member bench not to hear the case, since the bench was “selected” and headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial.
Justice Malik, part of the eight-member bench, said it appeared the government intended to get the benefit of the internal meetings of judges on regulating the court’s administrative affairs since such matters were discussed by all the judges in the full court meetings.
“All the time the court hears cases relating to vires and the legislative competence of a law, but we need to draw some line otherwise whenever a case relating to the independence of judiciary and legislative competence will come up, a request for the full court will be raised,” the judge observed.
Justice Malik said she was struggling to understand whether the order of a bench hearing such cases would not be good if rendered by a three-judge bench, but will be fine if given by the full court.
“Will the government even ask the high court to constitute the full court when such matters land in the high courts,” Justice Malik asked. If this logic prevails, it has to be applied everywhere, she added.
Justice Munib Akhtar reminded the attorney general that when parliament has itself answered in the law by stating that at least a bench consisting of five judges should interpret matters relating to procedures of the court then the plea being raised for the full court would mean that the parliament was wrong.
“The weakness of the government on counting is increasing,” Justice Akhtar observed, asking the AGP to notice eight judges were hearing the matter rather than five, which the law asked for.
The AGP argued that the questions involved in the matter were a case of first impression and therefore the fairest and most transparent course would be adjudication by all judges.
According to the AGP, the importance of the case at hand was critical as it required the power of the legislature to regulate the practice and procedure of the judicial organ on one hand and the constitutional command to secure the independence of the judiciary on the other.
The moot point in the matter, Justice Ijazul Ahsan reminded, revolved around legislative competence — an issue which was examined by courts every day.
When the AGP referred to a 1978 case where LHC CJ Sheikh Anwarul Haq constituted a full court of nine judges when former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto objected to the composition of the bench, Justice Bandial reminded that then it was a case of bias but former CJP Jawad S. Khawaja had already held that it was for the judge to decide about when such an objection was raised.
The AGP also apprised the court that the copies of the proceedings of the standing committee as well as parliament on the passing of the Supreme Court (Practice & Procedure) Bill, 2023 as directed by the court would likely be furnished on Tuesday (today).
‘Selected’ bench
The PML-N, in its plea submitted by Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed, asked the bench not to hear the case regulating the practice and procedure of the court, since the bench was “selected” and headed by CJP Bandial.
“The matter involves devolving and sharing the discretionary powers of the CJP himself — especially in relation to the formation of benches,” the plea said.
“In the circumstances, it would not at all be appropriate for the matter to be heard by an eight-member bench that is both selected (and headed) by the CJP,” contended Mr Ahmed.
At this, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar could not help but wonder whether the counsel has any concerns about the members of the bench.
After the argument of the AGP, Mr Ahmed recalled that the request of the full court was acceded to in 2019 in the Justice Qazi Faez Isa case, but Justice Ahsan reminded that in that case, the CJP was not heading the bench which was why the full court was constituted.
The counsel then read out the order to explain that direction was issued for the constitution of the full court to promote transparency in the hearing. “Invariably when the matter was complex, usually the court refers the matter to the full court.”
The CJP recalled that in the 2010 Iftikhar Chaudhry and 2019 Justice Isa cases, the president had referred the matter to the Supreme Judicial Council while levelling serious allegations against the judges. This affected the independence of the judiciary and the entire Supreme Court was on trial, he argued. But both the references, in the end, were quashed, he added.
The PML-N argued before the court that numerous sitting judges of the apex court as well as several retired judges over the years had openly voiced their reservations about the manner in which benches were constituted in the apex court. In the circumstances, the constitution of a full court will ensure justice was not only done but seen to be done and will protect the credibility of the apex court.
The PML-N also contended that it was for the first time in the history of Pakistan that an act of parliament has been restrained through interim order from coming into effect that too before the law got enacted.
Later, while talking to the media outside the Supreme Court, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry declared that whenever the party would come to power, it would initiate high treason proceedings against the caretaker set-ups in Punjab and KP for working beyond their 90-day mandate.

2,Plea seeking Punjab PA restoration dismissed as ‘unnecessary’,"Judge also slaps the petitioner with Rs100,000 fine.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday imposed a fine of Rs100,000 on a petitioner for filing a frivolous petition for the restoration of the Punjab Assembly.
Petitioner Sharafat Ali contended through his counsel that former chief minister Parvez Elahi had dissolved the provincial assembly unlawfully.
He said people of the province had been deprived of their mandate through an illegal act.
The petitioner urged the court to set aside the act of the assembly’s dissolution and reinstate the legislature.
Justice Shahid Karim asked the petitioner’s counsel about the profession of his client and his locus standi to agitate the matter.
Advocate Abid Chattah said the petitioner was a political worker from Faisalabad.
The judge dismissed the petition for being unnecessary and frivolous. He also slapped the petitioner with Rs100,000 fine and warned him that the amount would be enhanced if he sought an apology.
Earlier in April, the speakers of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies had moved the courts to get the legislatures restored.
“KP and Punjab Assembly speakers took Imran Khan in the loop then filed petitions in the courts for restoration of assemblies,” PTI President Parvez Elahi had said while responding to questions from reporters after attending a court hearing.

3,PAC chief seeks details of SC judge’s assets,Members split over scrutiny of individual cases,"ISLAMABAD: Amid a divide within the Public Accounts Committee over the parliamentary scrutiny of apex court judges, PAC Chairman Noor Alam Khan on Monday sought details of the assets and tax returns of Justice Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi.
The PAC chairman sought record of tax returns, wealth statement, plots and agricultural land of the top court judge.
The deputy speaker had referred the matter to the PAC for investigation and audit under Rule 199 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly 2007 with the directive to complete the task within 15 days. The matter was referred after former NA speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq demanded that PAC should take it up to find out sources of the judge’s income “to purchase a plot worth over Rs100 million and carrying out construction on it”. Besides conducting special audit of the matter, he said, tax details of the judge be also sought from the FBR.
During the Monday proceedings of PAC, PTI Senator Mohsin Aziz Khan questioned the parliamentary committee’s jurisdiction to probe the assets of a serving judge. Opposing the move, he suggested that the government should mend its ties with the judiciary instead.

Members split over scrutiny of individual cases

Calling the matter ‘very sensitive’, PAC member Shahida Akhtar Ali suggested that the committee must exercise utmost care.
PML-N lawmakers Barjees Tahir and Sheikh Rohale Asghar, however, recommended a thorough probe against the judge.
On the other hand, Mushahid Hussain Syed, who is also a PML-N lawmaker, reportedly said the government should not repeat the same mistake committed by the previous PTI regime that had moved a reference against Justice Qazi Faez Isa which had backfired. He said they should simply follow the Constitution instead of setting wrong precedents.
PTI legislator Dr Ramesh Kumar said he had already discussed the matter with the PAC members and some of them were of the opinion that taking up individual cases did not fall in their domain. However, several members in the 28-member committee believed they could take up the matter, since it was related to the financial benefits that the judges were availing through the national exchequer, he added.
Separately, Senator Mian Raza Rabbani in a statement opposed scrutiny of judge by a parliamentary panel.
“The PAC will be out of [its] jurisdiction if it inquires into the matter of the wealth of an individual judge of the Supreme Court. Other matters related to finances of the institution of the SC may be taken up by the PAC,” Senator Rabbani said.
He said parliament had for long abdicated its rights to the judiciary and executive, and must stand up to defend its territory and guard its constitutional rights. The present intra-institutional crisis required an institutional dialogue. The parliament should take the lead, he added.

4,CPEC will be extended to Afghanistan as trilateral cooperation set to deepen,"Three states vow to prevent TTP, ETIM from using their territories to harm security.","ISLAMABAD: The foreign ministers of Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan have reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen trilateral cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and jointly extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan.
Following the trilateral dialogue, the three sides issued a joint statement, expressing their determination to leverage Afghanistan’s potential as a hub for regional connectivity.
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang of China, and Acting Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi of Afghanistan participated in the dialogue representing their respective countries.
During the meeting, the three foreign ministers emphasised the significance of ongoing projects such as CASA-1000, TAPI, and Trans-Afghan Railways, highlighting their potential to boost regional connectivity and promote economic development and prosperity in the region.
The three parties emphasised the need to advance “hard connectivity” in infrastructure and “soft connectivity” in norms and standards.
They agreed to explore measures to facilitate the movement of people and trade activities. They also decided to boost transit trade through the Gwadar Port.

Three states vow to prevent TTP, ETIM from using their territories to harm security; need to avoid interference in Afghan affairs stressed

The foreign ministers acknowledged that a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan is in the best interest of the region. They emphasised the critical role of trilateral cooperation in promoting this objective.
 






The three sides agreed to further deepen and expand their cooperation in the domains of security, development, and politics, guided by the principles of mutual respect, equal-footed consultation, and mutual benefit.
The three parties highlighted the importance of addressing security challenges that pose a significant threat to regional and global security, and directly impacting the stability and economic prosperity of the entire region. They agreed to coordinate on security matters, including organised crime, drug smuggling and others.
They called upon the international community to strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation, and provide the necessary supplies, equipment, and technical assistance to relevant countries in this regard.
The three sides stressed the importance of preventing any individual, group, or party, including the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), from using their territories to harm or threaten regional security and interests or carry out terrorist activities. They also stressed the need to avoid interfering in Afghanistan’s internal affairs and instead focus on promoting peace, stability, and reconstruction in the country.
Highlighting the need to boost economic activity in Afghanistan, the ministers emphasised the significance of exploring feasible pathways towards reviving the Afghan economy.
As a step towards this goal, they agreed to consider additional support for the reconstruction of Afghanistan and exploring trilateral investment opportunities that promote industrialisation and job creation.
Expressing the solidarity with the people of Afghanistan they stressed the crucial need for sustained and urgent humanitarian support, including bridging funding gaps for humanitarian operations. They underlined that humanitarian support for the people of Afghanistan should not be linked to any political considerations.
They expressed satisfaction with the current trilateral cooperation and agreed to carry out exchange and training programs, as well as strengthen people-to-people exchanges by implementing trilateral programs in line with the List of China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Trilateral Practical Cooperation Projects adopted by the foreign ministers during this dialogue.
The three sides reiterated their cooperation in areas of mutual interest, such as economic development, capacity building and improving livelihoods. The ministers agreed to enhance cooperation in agriculture, trade, energy, capacity building and border management.
The ministers also urged the international community to engage constructively with Afghanistan, acknowledging the efforts made under various mechanisms and formats, including the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan, to promote dialogue and constructive engagement with the Afghan Interim Government.
 






The ministers also urged the international community to provide assistance to Afghanistan in countering narcotics effectively and developing alternative crops to enhance its capacity for independent and sustainable development.
They called on the relevant countries to lift their unilateral sanctions against Afghanistan, return assets overseas for the benefit of the Afghan people, and create opportunities for economic development and prosperity in Afghanistan.
Taking note of the Afghan Interim Government’s repeated assurances to respect and protect women’s rights and interests, they called on the international community to support the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan and to help Afghanistan improve governance and strengthen capacity building to effectively protect the basic rights and interests of all segments of Afghan society, including women and children.
The ministers expressed gratitude to neighbouring countries, especially Pakistan, for hosting millions of Afghan refugees and providing them with generous hospitality.
They called on the international community to provide necessary support and assistance to these countries and Afghanistan for the dignified return and reintegration of refugees into Afghan society.
The three sides emphasised their commitment to continuing the trilateral cooperation mechanism, including the Director-General Level Practical Cooperation Dialogue, and to forging closer, good-neighbourly relations and partnerships.

5,"Situationer: Over 740 fishermen in Pakistani, Indian jails await return","Fishermen detained in both countries called victims of ""legal complexities, weak communication""."," 

INDIAN fishermen display rosaries made by them during detention in Karachi’s Malir jail.—NCHR

MORE than 740 fishermen incarcerated in Indian and Pakistani prisons for trespassing water borders have completed their sentences, but their release and eventual repatriation have not materialised due to the apathy of governments on both sides of the border.
In Indian jails of Delhi, Gujarat and Tihar, over 113 Pakistanis who had been detained for trespassing water borders in 2015-2022 are waiting to return home after completing their sentences.
But they remain in prison in spite of the Consular Access Agreement signed in 2008 wherein Islamabad and New Delhi agreed to “release and repatriate persons within one month of confirmation of their national status and completion of their sentences”.
“My son had gone fishing, but the winds were strong and his boat drifted away. He never came back,” says a woman in a conversation with the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR). The commission launched a campaign alongside the Legal Aid Society advocating the release of fishermen detained in both countries and highlighting the issue at all fora.

Fishermen detained in both countries called victims of ‘legal complexities, weak communication’

The woman, surrounded by her grandchildren, appealed to the government to bring her son home as his children were looking forward to their father’s homecoming.
“My father had gone fishing…but never came back,” his daughter said.
‘631 ready to go home’
The story of Indian fishermen imprisoned in Karachi’s Malir jail is no different. According to the government record, “654 fishermen are detained” in Pakistan; out of which, 631 are ready for repatriation.
A group of fishermen, who had been detained after their launch wandered into Pakistan’s waters, said they were detained in 2018 on board the same fishing launch. “I have five kids; I haven’t talked to them since 2019,” one of them said in response to a question.
All prisoners had one thing in common — overextended stays in jail and lack of contact with their families.
“We ventured into the sea to catch fish, but these people [maritime agency/coast guard] detained us and brought us here [jail],” said a greybeard clad in dark clothes, on the verge of breaking down.
A young man interjects the conversation, pleading, “Do something for us. There is nobody back home to take care of family in my absence.” He added that for the past four years, they were being assured that they would go home but that never happened.
“Last time, they took us to a court and the judge said we’d be able to go home in three months,” the prisoner said, lamenting that the incident happened four months ago.
In reference to the Consular Access Agreement, a prisoner said they do have a yearly contact with the consular but there has been no contact with the family. “The consulate [sic] does come here every year but prisoners are released in small batches,” one of the detainees said as he called upon his country’s authorities for repatriation.
In the absence of support from the Indian government amid long sentences, these fishermen make beads to eke out a living.
It may be noted that 200 Indian fishermen will likely to be released on May 12, as per reports in the media.
No progress on SC judgement
After the plight of prisoners was highlighted in the Supreme Court through a plea submitted by the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum, a three-member bench of the top court issued a set of instructions to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maritime Security Agency, and Ministry of Interior in September 2018, asking them to take measures to prevent the detention of Pakistani fishermen.
The court also ordered the foreign ministry to create a website containing details of prisoners jailed in Indian prisons. This database was supposed to have personal details of prisoners, place of imprisonment, status of legal proceedings, and possible time period of repatriation.
The court had said the government would make efforts to ensure the implementation of the Consular Access Agreement as well as provide legal assistance, including payment of fines, to fishermen in India’s jails.
The court also asked the government to evolve an appropriate mechanism to be developed as to how to implement the recommendations and rectify the problems identified in the 7th meeting of the India-Pakistan Joint Judicial Committee on Prisoners within three months of the disposal order of the case.
In the order, the Supreme Court had also directed the ministries of interior and foreign affairs to ensure “prompt response to any representation” regarding the detention of Pakistan prisoners in Indian jails.
‘Shifting responsibility’
However, despite the court order, there has been no apparent progress on the issue. According to an NCHR official, the foreign ministry asked the commission to approach the interior ministry regarding the repatriation of prisoners detained in India as “everything was clear on their end”.
“The foreign office was quick to respond, but officials of the interior ministry did not give two hoots about the issue,” the official said, adding that three letters were written to the ministry in March and April but there was no reply.
A source in the NCHR said they may seek contempt of court proceedings against the ministry over its refusal to brief the commission on the status of fishermen jailed in India.
In response to Dawn’s requests about the status of this correspondence, Ministry of Interior spokesperson Qadir Tiwana chose not to reply in spite of multiple reminders since Tuesday.
Dormant joint committee
According to the NCHR official, a joint judicial committee to facilitate the return of prisoners from both countries has been dormant for years.
In 2018, reports in Indian media suggested that New Delhi has appointed its members to the commission and also asked Pakistan for the same.
However, Pakistan has yet to notify its members to the joint commission — the only member from the Pakistani side is former justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, who is reportedly not well.
FO Spokesperson Mumtaz Zehra Baloch was approached for clarity on the status of the joint commission as well as the top court’s order regarding the creation of the website to monitor fishermen detained in India.
Ms Baloch responded, “Actually, these details would be available with [the] Ministry of Interior.”
The interior ministry spokesperson did not respond to repeated messages and calls.
On the other side of the border, authorities are not so keen on facilitating the fisherfolk either. A letter written by the NCHR chairperson to her Indian counterpart on the condition of fishermen incarcerated on both sides of the border has remained unanswered.
Similarly, a letter to the Indian and Pakistani premiers in April this year by several rights groups also remained an exercise in futility.
Speaking about the situation of prisoners, NCHR Chairperson Rabiya Javeri Agha said these were one of the most vulnerable communities in Pakistan. “These people are not criminals, and it is really pathetic that they have no recourse to get in touch with their families/children,” she said, seeking support from both sides of the border to facilitate the return of the fisherfolk who are victims of “legal complexities and weak communication”.
