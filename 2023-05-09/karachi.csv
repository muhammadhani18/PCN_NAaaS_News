The City Courts police registered the case against PTI’s Sindh chapter chief Ali Zaidi, Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh and others under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapon), 506-B (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
A police officer, who wished not to be named, told Dawn on Monday that the case was registered on the complaint of Inspector Faisal Gul, who is the investigating officer of the case against PTI leader Hassan Niazi registered at the Jamshed Quarters police station.
He said that the case pertained to alleged hooliganism during the court appearance of Mr Niazi in Ramazan by PTI leaders and workers that created hindrances in the performance of police’s official work.
He said that the complainant had submitted an application for registration of an FIR and the police accepted it on Sunday night.
Asad Umar gets protective bail for seven days
The Sindh High Court on Monday granted seven-day protective bail to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) general secretary Asad Umar in a case registered against him in Islamabad.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha ordered that the bail was subject to furnishing solvent surety of Rs25,000 and directed him to appear before the court concerned within stipulated period.
The PTI leader along with his counsel appeared in the SHC. His lawyers argued that a case was registered against him at Margala police station for taking out a rally in support of the judiciary on May 6, allegedly without permission of local administration.
The lawyers further argued that they approached Islamabad High Court after the deputy commissioner had refused to grant permission for the rally and the IHC had directed the DC to hear the petitioner and decide application in accordance with the law through reasoned order, who failed to implement court order and turned down the same again.

1,"Loadshedding, change of exam centres add to students’ woes","SSC exam’s first day marred by mismanagement, confusion","KARACHI: Mismanagement, prolonged loadshedding and widespread complaints of a last-minute change of exam centres marred the smooth holding of the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examinations that commenced here on Monday.
The first paper, three-hour Computer Science (theory) for SSC Part 1, or class nine, reportedly started on time at 9:30am at all the 524 exam centres set up by the Board of Secondary Education Karachi (BSEK).
But this year there was much confusion seen among the candidates due to many overnight centres’ changes. It is not that this has not happened before, but this time there were just so many centre changes and that too at the eleventh hour.
BSEK chairman Syed Sharaf Ali Shah conceded the last minute shifting of centres. “The schools we had made the exam centres came up with all kinds of excuses such as construction work under way at their schools, shortage of staff, etc,” he told Dawn.

SSC exam’s first day marred by mismanagement, confusion

“This all happened with the private school centres, mind you. And what can one say to private schools? Still, we made them take the responsibility to inform the candidates, who had their centres with them, about the change. We also asked them to let the children, who still arrived there to appear for their exams, to take their exams as their time should not be wasted at any cost,” he added.
Another huge issue during the exam’s initial day was rampant power loadshedding. Complaints about students having to take their exams in extreme heat and in dark classrooms were coming from all over, especially from Malir, Landhi and PECHS.
At the secondary boys’ section of Gulistan Shah Abdul Latif School in Sindhi Muslim Society, there was something very strange going on as the students were saying that there was no electricity at the exam centre since morning when they had arrived to take the exam at 9:30am while the school principal, Nayyar Alam, said there was no power since 11.30am.
Later, it was discovered that they had run out of fuel for the school generator at around 11:30am. “What to do? We have been running back and forth to the petrol pump to get fuel to run the generator, but it also dries up due to such an extended power failure,” he said.
After that when more fuel was brought for the generator again, there was another revelation: the said generator was a really small one that could only power the principal’s office. He had been sending staff to fetch fuel to only keep his own office cool. The students, meanwhile, carried on with their exams in the heat and dark.
“It’s okay. My parents said to me a few days ago that this is only my first big exam, but there will be more exams in my life to brace for,” said a young boy seated right in the back of a classroom.
“But it is not okay,” the BSEK chairman said, after being told how the students were braving hardships. “A class nine student is really young and he or she is already under mental pressure due to the exams. It is not right to make life more difficult for these children by making them sweat in the heat as they solve their papers,” he said.
“The matric board as well as the minister for universities and boards had written to K-Electric to refrain from loadshedding during the morning and afternoon exam shifts, but here is the result of that exercise,” he threw his hands up in the air.
“K-Electric listens to no one and does as it pleases. But the power utility really ought to have a heart,” he added.
Asked about cheating practices and the bad habit of students of bringing mobile phones to exam centres, Mr Shah said there should be a rule against it. “In Punjab, all mobile phones found on students at examination centres are simply confiscated. We need to do the same in Sindh. It will automatically fix this issue at least,” he said.
Meanwhile, not many exam centres had any security as had been promised to them by the government. When the BSEK chairman was asked about that, he said they on their part had requested for security of course and if it was not to be seen then, well, that’s a shame.

2,"Our votes will elect next Karachi mayor, PTI reminds PPP",Ruling party accused of offering money to buy LG representatives of other parties.,"• Energy minister congratulates Sindh Assembly on PPP’s victory in by-polls
• Ruling party accused of offering money to buy LG representatives of other parties                                   
KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly on Monday was echoed with heated arguments between lawmakers belonging to the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party and opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf over Sunday’s by-elections on remaining union committees of Karachi.
The opposition party reminded the PPP that the next mayor of Karachi would be elected with PTI votes.
The situation took an unpleasant turn at the outset of Question Hour when Energy Minister Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh congratulated the PPP leadership, workers and people over their victory in the by-polls across the province.
His remarks enraged PTI’s parliamentary party leader Khurram Sher Zaman and Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s lone member Syed Abdur Rasheed, as they accused the PPP-led provincial government of using all government machinery to influence the recently concluded by-elections.
Mr Sher Zaman said: “It would be the PTI whose votes will elect the man for Karachi mayor.”
The energy minister said that the victory was tantamount to peoples’ confidence in the PPP who voted for the party in every election. He said the opposition parties could not compete the ‘services’ being tendered by the PPP government with their ‘hooliganism’.
Hitting back at the energy minister, the PTI parliamentary party leader said that the PPP had ‘offered’ sacks of money to buy conscience of local government representatives of other parties.
“But yet they [PPP] will be unable to get its mayor elected in Karachi. It would be the PTI whose votes will elect the man for Karachi mayor slot,” he added.
After Sunday’s by-election, the PPP has become the single largest party in the City Council but it still lacked simple majority to bring its candidate as next Karachi mayor. It has to either forge an alliance with the Jamaat-i-Islami or the PTI to get the coveted mayoral office.
Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari kept on reminding the PTI leader to stick to the questions related to the energy department, but in vain.
Call attention notices
Responding to a call attention by Grand Democratic Alliance member Nand Kumar Golkani, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla said that the provincial government was going to build two million houses for flood victims in the next three months.
He said that a survey in this regard had already been done. “The provincial government has provided a lot of support to flood affected people,” he added.
The GDA MPA in his call attention notice asked that how many houses were built as announced earlier by the provincial government for the flood-hit people.
Ali Khurshidi of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan in his call attention notice raised the issue relating to the theft of iron from bridges, underpasses, green belts and other infrastructure in different parts of the city. He said that mainly drug addicts were involved in the crime who used to sell the iron to junk dealers.
Responding to the call attention notice, Parliamentary Secretary for Local Government Saleem Baloch termed it a big issue of the city and said that similar complaints were being received.
He said that Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s department took action against such offenders.
Question Hour
While furnishing statement and replies to the lawmakers’ written and verbal questions, Energy Minister Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh said that currently 24 wind IPPs were operating in the province with a capacity of 1,235MW.
He said that 59 projects of 3,900MW were initiated by the Directorate of Alternate Energy, Energy Department which included 35 wind projects of 2,485MW, 23 solar projects of 1,400MW and one hydro project of 15MW.
He said that two wind IPPs initiated by the energy department with a capacity of 100MW were operational, adding that 10 wind IPPs with cumulative capacity of 510MW were under construction in Jhimpir, Thatta.
He said that three solar IPPs with a total capacity of 150MW were under construction in Sukkur.
Besides, he added, wind IPPs with a capacity of 1,875MW, 20 solar IPPs of 1,250MW and one hydro project of 150MW were under construction.
To a question asked by Mr Sher Zaman, the energy minister said the department had launched a project to provide solar energy to at least 200,000 houses in the province.
He said that the estimated cost of a basic solar home system consisting three lights, one fan and a mobile charging facility was around $40,000.
He said that actual cost would be determined from market through open bidding.
Mr Shaikh said that the price of solar panels and other equipment had increased due to the hike in the dollar price and the provincial government had decided to increase the subsidy on it. 
In response to a question, Mr Shaikh said that they will also solarise all the governmental buildings in the province.
He said that total 399 villages had been electrified with the service territories of Hesco and Sepco.
Later, the sitting was adjourned till Tuesday (today).

5,JI slams PPP for ‘stealing mandate of Karachi’,Wahab calls for probe into Jamaat’s election spending,"KARACHI: A day after the by-election on remaining 11 union committees of the metropolis, leadership of the Pakistan Peoples Party and Jamaat-i-Islami — the two top contenders for the office of Karachi mayor — continued to trade allegations against each other.
“Condemning” the role of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for failing to ensure fair and peaceful polling in Karachi, the JI called the ruling PPP “fascist” and accused it of using government machinery and its workers as an “armed force” to “steal the mandate of Karachi”.
Speaking at a press conference at Idara Noor-i-Haq, JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that the ECP had failed miserably in holding free and fair local government elections in Karachi to meet its constitutional obligation and prime responsibility.
“We condemn the Election Commission for playing a nefarious role in support of the fascism showed by the PPP government in Sindh during Sunday’s by-elections,” he said.

Wahab calls for probe into Jamaat’s election spending

“The PPP captured a number of polling stations and threw out our and other parties workers at gun point. At several spots, armed workers of PPP attacked JI polling agents and its workers. What’s the use of law enforcement agencies in the city when they are unable to protect the lives of people,” he asked.
He said that JI would keep its struggle on for the city and its people, vowing that the party will form the local government in Karachi despite all the “fascism” showed by PPP and its goons.
PPP hits back, says people reject JI
Heaping scorns at the JI, the PPP on Monday called for investigations into JI’s spending on local government elections in Karachi, alleging that the party was using funds it had generated in the name of charity and donation for its welfare wing.
The PPP strongly criticised JI for its “hatred-based” narrative that was “rejected” by the people of Karachi, and accused it of “exploiting” the politics of agitation after conceding defeat in the elections.
“I think there should be an inquiry on the mandate of Jamaat-i-Islami, and to investigate which social organisation’s charitable donations were used for politics,” Sindh government spokesman and Chief Minister’s Law Adviser Barrister Murtaza Wahab told reporters.
Later, addressing a press conference, Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said the success of PPP was a reflection of the trust that the people of Karachi had on the party and its leadership.
“The people have showed their confidence by voting for PPP. The development work happening in Karachi is remarkable, featuring the construction of bridges, underpasses, and the removal of garbage, while new buses are operating, along with other development projects,” he added.
Calling JI’s narrative “a bundle of lies”, he said the opposition party was only finding lame excuses after suffering defeat.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah also expressed his gratitude to the people of the province for reposing their confidence in the PPP in the LG by-polls. He said that now a ‘jiyala’ would be the mayor of Karachi.

6,An evening of spiritual music,Noted qawwal enthral audience with their performance at Arts Council,"KARACHI: Farid Ayaz and Abu Muhammad are, inarguably, the most celebrated qawwals of the modern era. Justifiably so. Sons of the legendary Munshi Raziuddin, they come from a family that’s revered for being the Qawwal Bachon Ka Gharana. But they do not just bank on lineage. It’s the musical zest steeped in their deep love for the divine with which they carry themselves that makes them stand head and shoulders above their contemporaries. 
It is precisely for this reason that a sizable number of people turned up on Sunday evening at the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi, to listen to them. 
The concert, as per qawwali tradition, began with Qol. It immediately got the audience’s attention. The duo has developed this habit over the years that they do not go for the longer version of the famous composition and switch to the quick-paced tarana swiftly.
Then came the beautiful na’at by Hazrat Amir Khusrau ‘Mere banney ki baat na puchho’. They always perform this piece with the kind of dedication that’s required for it. On Sunday it was no different. During the performance, Farid Ayaz advised some youngsters in the crowd who were sitting in front of the stage not to take selfies. He did that again during the course of the gig.

Noted qawwal enthral audience with their performance at Arts Council

The next composition was in compliance with a request that came from an audience member. It was the thoughtfully penned ‘Rok leti hai aap ki nisbat’. This is where the brothers sounded at their musical best because the arrangement required a great deal of vocal control. 
And how can any qawwali programme go without ‘Chhaap tilak sab chheeni re’?This is one composition that gets the young and the old sway to its beat and lip synch its words with equal passion. Farid Ayaz and Abu Muhammad, again, do not opt for the whole kalaam, instead they intersperse it with synonymous modern-day couplets and phrases. It was an enjoyable experience. 
The concert lasted for more than 90 minutes, culminating in Rang.
While one appreciates and acknowledges Farid Ayaz sahib for his great talent and immense contribution to the world of music, one would humbly suggest to him that he should refrain from using words, even in jest, such as jaahil for the audience. It does not befit his stature. 
The event was part of the Arts Council’s annual Eid Milan dinner.

7,SHC commutes death sentence of two murderers to life term,Bench rules provision of Anti-Terrorism Act was not applicable in FIR,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Monday commuted the death penalty of two appellants to life imprisonment in a murder case.
An antiterrorism court had sentenced Mohammad Qasier and Mohammad Sohail to death in September last year for kidnapping and murdering 15-year-old Junaid in March 2019.
Both convicts, through their lawyers, challenged the trial court order before the high court and after hearing both sides and examining the evidence, a division bench headed by Justice K. K. Agha commuted the death sentence to life term.
The bench in its verdict observed that the prosecution had proved its case against the appellants, adding that the case was based on circumstantial evidence as there was no eyewitness or a last seen witness.
It further noted that both the appellants had recorded their confessional statements before a judicial magistrate and the confessions appeared to have been made voluntarily.

Bench rules provision of Anti-Terrorism Act was not applicable in FIR 

The bench said that both the appellants had also worked together and lived close to each other and planned to abduct the victim boy for demanding a ransom from his father. However, they killed him as they feared the boy could identify them if released.
About offences under the Anti-Terrorism Act, the court noted that there was no evidence to prove that the crime was committed with a design, intention or purpose to create terror, but rather to extort money by way of ransom and the provisions of ATA were not applicable in the case.
“Although the evidence suggests that the motive behind the abduction was to receive a ransom for the return of the abducted Junaid we find that although money may have been collected in case that situation arose no actual demand for ransom has been proven by the prosecution through either ocular evidence or other forms of evidence for example audio recording and as such we acquit the appellants for the offence under Section 365-A of PPC,” the bench ruled.
Regarding sentencing, the bench noted that since the case was based on circumstantial evidence and there was need to show extra caution, the death penalty was being reduced to life imprisonment.
According to the prosecution, the victim went missing on March 11, 2019 and on April 6 his mobile phone was activated. The police traced the man, Waseem Nadir, who was using the phone and he told investigators that he had purchased the cell phone from one Sohail. The police managed to arrest Sohail and his accomplice Qaiser and they both confessed to have kidnapping and killed the boy. The police recovered parts of the victim’s body on a lead provided by the appellants.

The Baghdadi police said that Asif Mohammed, 25, was targeted by unknown assailants near Aath Chowk. He was recently released from prison.
City SSP Arif Aziz opined that the murder appeared to be an outcome of some personal enmity.
In another incident, a young man, identified as Khan Zada, was gunned down within the remit of the Manghopir police station on Monday morning.
While police attributed some personal enmity behind the murder, area people said that he was killed by robbers. They also staged a protest demonstration against an alarming rise in street crime in their area.

9,"Scale of Sindh population undercount shocking, says Taj Haider","HYDERABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party Senator Taj Hyder, who is also a member of the party’s core committee, has said...","HYDERABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party Senator Taj Hyder, who is also a member of the party’s core committee, has said that while it was always anticipated that Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) would undercount the population of Sindh, it was the enormity of the undercount that was really shocking.
As a result, he said, the fresh census had become much more controversial than the census of 2017, adding that similar complaints of undercount were coming forth from Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In a statement issued on Monday, he said that the calculation of Sindh’s population was fairly simple. He shared that there were 43,838 population blocks in Sindh according to PBS data, and that 250 households were mandatory in each block. However, on ground 500 to 800 households per block were common. “We will still be on a very low side if we take a figure of 300 households per block in calculation. Multiplying this figure with the number of blocks gives us the total number of households in Sindh as 13,151,400,” he said.
Unicef conducts a Multi Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) in 128 countries every four years jointly with federal and provincial governments, according to him. The latest MICS in Sindh conducted jointly by Unicef and federal and Sindh bureaus of statistics, officially put average family size in Sindh at 6.5, he said, and added that multiplying this figure with the number of households in Sindh shows the population of Sindh as 85,484,100.
He said that Sindh had, therefore, been undercounted by a good 30 million persons. Calling the census a failure, he explained that not having a single demographer from Sindh in the census advisory group while preparing working paper, insistence on anti-Sindh de-jure method of counting in working paper, ultra-long questionnaire with irrelevant questions, untrained crowds of enumerators, most of whom had never used a tablet, and unending time given for selective count adjustment were some of the factors which guaranteed the failure of this exercise even before it started.
For the past 17 months, he said, “we have been knocking our heads against the wall of PBS and federal government. In so many communications and meetings, Chief Minister Sindh has been cautioning them against repeating old mistakes”. 
He shared that in a meeting held at the CM House on August 1, 2022, he (Taj) directly questioned the foul intent in the background of what they had already done. But ‘sweet talkers’ did what they had planned on day one, he said.

While most candidates were found complaining to invigilators about their agony, at least one candidate had to be given first aid after he fainted at an exam centre. 
The situation prompted the Mirpurkhas Deputy commissioner to write to the Hesco authorities asking them to avoid any loadshedding at least during the exam timings.
The Mirpurkhas Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) has made suitable arrangements for the smooth holding of the exams while the district administration and police had also made elaborate security arrangements to ensure peace at and around all exam centres. A strict ban was imposed on the entry of unconcerned people into the centres while operators of all photostat shops were asked to keep their business closed during the exam timings. 
According to a BISE press release, vigilance teams of the board paid surprise visits to various centres across the division to check use of unfair means by candidates. They found around 40 candidates trying to use unfair means and sent their cases to the disciplinary action committee, said the press release.
