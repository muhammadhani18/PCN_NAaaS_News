0,"Amid token strike by millers, KP asks Punjab to lift ban on wheat supply",CM also complains vehicles with Passco wheat stopped at checkposts,"PESHAWAR: The government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday asked the Punjab government to allow unrestricted supply of the wheat and its products to the northwestern province by abolishing checkposts it set up to check the movement of the staple commodity.
Also in the day, flour millers in the province began a two-day token strike against Punjab’s ban on wheat transportation.
In a letter, caretaker KP Chief Minister Mohammad Azam Khan asked his Punjab counterpart, Mohsin Raza Naqvi, for an immediate end to the restriction on wheat transportation.
“The impression is being created that these measures by the Punjab food department are against the spirit of Article 151(3)(a) of the Constitution, which refrains the provincial government from restricting the free inter-provincial movement of food commodities,” he noted in the letter.

CM also complains vehicles with Passco wheat stopped at checkposts

Mr Khan said KP was a wheat-deficit province with its wheat requirements standing at 5.1 million metric tons against the local production of 1.3 million metric tons.
“This shortfall is being overcome through open wheat/flour trade from Punjab,” he said.
The KP chief minister said the province required 14,000 tons of wheat and flour daily.
He also said the province’s food department maintained operational and strategic food reserves.
“Operational reserves are released to flour mills during the lean period i.e. from September 1 to April 30. During the May-September period, the province [KP] is totally dependent on wheat and flour supply from the open market, mainly from Punjab. Approximately 72pc of our total requirements is fulfilled by Punjab through open private wheat and flour trade,” he said.
Mr Khan said that Punjab’s food department had established checkposts on the entry points of KP restricting the movement of wheat and flour and adversely affecting supplies in the local markets.
He said that the price of wheat and flour had significantly increased, while the shortage of wheat and flour in the open market was imminent that could lead to the law and order situation in the province.
In the letter, the KP chief minister said the vehicles loaded with wheat purchased from the Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation (Passco) on the “government-to-government basis” were also stopped unnecessarily though a verification mechanism had been established after a meeting with the prime minister.
“The civil society in KP, including the flour mills association, have agitated the issue through press conferences and requested me to take up the issue with the Punjab government for free movement of wheat and flour. It is therefore requested that Punjab authorities be directed to remove checkposts to allow the free movement of wheat and its products to KP in the best public interest,” he said.
Mr Khan added that supply of the Passco’s wheat for KP should be allowed after verification by the food department.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Flour Mills Association’s KP chapter began a two days token strike to protest the Punjab government’s curbs on wheat supply to the province.
Provincial chairman of the PFMA Haji Mohammad Iqbal said that though the requests and protests by the local millers, there was no progress on the issue.
“Our [association] leaders will meet today (Tuesday) to chalk out the future course of action against the unjustified and illegal restrictions by the Punjab government on wheat movement,” he said.
Meanwhile, adviser to the prime minister Amir Muqam said he contacted the prime minister and sought his intervention over Punjab’s ban on wheat supply.
“The prime minister, who is in London, contacted the Punjab authorities and directed them to resolve the issue,” he said in a statement.

They said Mr Elahi had also attacked the electricity grid stations on several occasions in the past.
The protesters demanded of the authorities to end political appointments in Pesco and take legal action against Mr Elahi for attacking grid stations.

4,KP governor claims holding backdoor talks with PTI leaders,"“I hope for some positive results in this dialogue,” says Governor Ghulam Ali.","PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Ghulam Ali on Monday said that he hoped the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) would show flexibility in its position on the election issue as he was holding backdoor talks with some of its senior leaders to resolve the issue in the “larger interest” of the country.
“I hope for some positive results in this dialogue,” the governor told Dawn here.
Mr Ali claimed that he asked Senate chairman Mohammad Sadiq Sanjrani to “intervene and play a positive role to bring political parties closer.”
He said there shouldn’t be any issue if polls were held in October.
The governor said that PTI chairman Imran Khan ordered his party’s members to resign from the National Assembly and dissolved the assemblies of Punjab and KP.

Says hopeful for positive results in dialogue

He said that members of the Sindh and Balochistan assemblies won’t agree to the dissolution of their respective houses before the competition of their constitutional terms. Mr Ali claimed that everybody was on the same page on general elections but the issue was about when they should be held.
“What will happen if polls are held in October instead of September [as demanded by the PTI]?”
The governor said that the country’s current financial position didn’t allow the holding of elections in intervals, while the law and order situation didn’t favour such electoral exercise either, so the government advocated nationwide polls the same day.
Earlier after receiving the torch of 34th National Games at the Governor’s House, Mr Ali told reporters that the Supreme Court and parliament would be on the same page on elections.
“Any decision on general elections will be made in the larger interest of the country,” he said.
The governor said that the Supreme Court was the country’s top court, while the Election Commission of Pakistan was also one of the highest constitutional bodies in the country.
He said that he met President Dr Arif Alvi twice and called for a “collective decision” on polls.
On April 18, Governor Haji Ghulam Ali had said the security situation in the province didn’t favour the holding of election to the provincial assembly and the Supreme Court shared his opinion.
“The apex court understands that the law and order situation in KP is not conducive to elections,” he told reporters at the provincial headquarters of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl.
Mr Ali had also said that he was grateful to the Supreme Court for being “lenient” with KP regarding elections. He added that there was no ambiguity regarding the holding of elections within 90 days of the assembly’s dissolution but it was his job to announce the poll date. He claimed that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf led by former prime minister Imran Khan didn’t push for elections in KP as it did for Punjab polls.

5,Trade with Afghanistan via Torkham on constant decline,Traders allege govt departments not serious in addressing their issues.,"KHYBER: Contrary to repeated official pledges and rosy promises about an increase in trade with Afghanistan through Torkham border and provision of facilities to traders, the quantum of bilateral trade has been on constant decline since 2016.
According to official figures, the quantum of bilateral trade with Afghanistan has plummeted to a mere $800 million in comparison to $1.3 billion per annum in 2015-16, thanks to a lack of interest and coordination between various government departments operating at Torkham.
Importers, exporters, custom clearing agents and transporters with whom this scribe interacted on the matter said that visits by different government dignitaries to Torkham and a series of consultative meetings proved to be an exercise in futility and a mere photo session.
“I have been attending such meetings at Torkham, Peshawar and even Islamabad since 2016 but all such occasions proved to be a mere ‘rhetoric’ as nothing concrete is done to alleviate the sufferings of traders and transporters while the trade is on the constant decline,” Haji Jabir Shinwari, patron-in-chief of All KP Exporters Association and a founding member of Khyber Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told this scribe.

Traders allege govt departments not serious in addressing their issues

He said that government had no will to promote bilateral trade with Afghanistan and solve the issues faced by traders and transporters.
He said that around 120 of the total 131 exporters had shifted their businesses outside Pakistan during the last three to four years due to the unfriendly trade policies of the government. He added that lucrative offers were made to him by some traders-friendly countries for taking out his capital from Pakistan.
Haji Jabir said that he had stopped attending official meetings regarding promotion of trade with Afghanistan via Torkham, Kharlaachi, Ghulam Khan and Chaman as those meetings had ‘dealt a blow’ to the trade rather than promoting it due to the anti-traders attitude of the government officials and relevant departments.
Zahidullah Shinwari, a two-time president of Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, wondered as to why the clearance of export goods slowed down when trade with Afghanistan had declined to a mere 20 per cent in comparison to the start of construction work on the so-called state-of-the-art custom terminal in 2015.
He said that trade was at a ‘fast track’ when infrastructure was and limited facilities were available to traders but it had suddenly nosedived when officials started tall claims about provision of modern facilities along with the completion of road from Peshawar to Torkham some seven years ago.
He said that despite holding a series of meetings, no government official or department had so far tried to reach to the root cause of the problems, which were hampering bilateral trade with Afghanistan.
“We have failed to devise ways for better trade with Afghanistan despite favourable signs from the neighbouring country,” said Mr Shinwari. He added that Pakistan was yet to sign a free trade, preferential trade agreement with Afghanistan besides reducing taxes and tariffs for the collective benefit of traders of both countries.
He while government was seeking dollars, local traders with their personal efforts and business trust could earn and bring billions of dollars if sincere and serious efforts were made to improve bilateral trade with Afghanistan.
Mujeebullah, an exporter and clearing agent, said that introduction of new border management policy in 2016 proved to be the ‘mother of all ills’ for local traders and transporters as that policy hugely impacted the ‘free trade’ going on with Afghanistan since the country’s independence.
He said that instead of creating hurdles in the name of border management, the government should pursue a policy of free and easy trade with war-affected Afghanistan as it was in need of cheap and speedy receipt of goods consignments from Pakistan to its every corner.
He cited traffic congestion due to slow goods clearance by custom authorities and electronic scanning of every vehicle by National Logistic Cell, little parking space for loaded and empty vehicles at Torkham, security checking at the zero point and denial of permission to an assistant driver or cleaner without visa into Pakistan as some of the major issued faced by local traders, transporters and custom clearing agents.
He said that obstacles to swift clearance of trade goods considerably cut down custom revenues while the relevant departments were least interested in removing those lacunas as there was a serious lack of coordination among the various government entities operating at Torkham.
“It seems that different government departments and agencies, stationed at Torkham, are in a ‘mad’ run to outdo each other in discouraging local traders for carrying out bilateral trade with Afghanistan and also discrediting their own departments,” said a young custom clearing agent, who wished not to be named.
National Logistic Cell officials, however, said that the custom terminal would be completed by the end of current year to address the issues of parking, traffic congestion and slow goods clearance.
The newly-appointed chief collector (custom) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Fayyaz Anwar, also had during a meeting at Torkham on April 8 gave a firm assurance to all the stakeholders that concrete steps would be taken to remove hurdles to trade between the two neighbouring countries as soon as possible.
Traders and transporters at Torkham, however, said that nothing concrete had happened since then and they were still faced with delays in goods clearance while many among them were deserting the business due to lack of facilities and interest by the official quarters.
They also doubted NLC claims about completion of the custom terminal by the end of the year and said that there was still a lot to be done as the pace of work on it was not up to the mark.

8,Public health lab seeks Rs40m for effective response to mpox,Director says last funding from health dept received in 2021,"PESHAWAR: The Public Health Reference Laboratory, Khyber Medical University, has demanded funds to ensure effective response to mpox as the province has recorded 99 suspected cases so far.
In a letter addressed to the health department, Dr Yasar Mehmood Yousafzai, the director of Public Health Reference Laboratory (PHRL), has asked for provision of Rs40 million, not only to process the samples of suspected cases of mpox but also to conduct PCRs of Covid-19 and investigate the specimen of suspected typhoid, cholera, dengue, Congo fever, chikungunya, hepatitis and influenza cases.
It said that the province was currently processing 99 samples of suspected mpox cases and it was an obligation of the government to start testing as World Health Organisation (WHO) had declared the disease an emergency of international concern. It said that National Command and Operation Centre was holding regular review meetings about the ailment.
The letter said that the WHO’s guidelines recommended that prevention and control of mpox and its testing in provinces and at international borders was mandatory to put brakes on it and stop its outbreak.

Director says last funding from health dept received in 2021

The PHRL director said that two cases were recorded in Sindh province recently and the infection could spread to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through international and local transmission, especially when skin conditions such as chickenpox, measles and other viral infections were prevalent in the province. He said that PCR test for mpox must be ensured in the larger public interest to avoid panic and ensure prompt response.
He said that PHRL was the only laboratory in the province where PCR for mpox could be conducted if the department released funds for procurement of kits, chemicals, consumable and human resources. “Our staffers are trained in lab testing as well as public health aspects of infectious diseases. Besides mpox, the lab will conduct differential diagnosis of measles and chickenpox to generate better public health response,” he added.
The PHRL is located at Khyber Medical University and run by health department. It has been working in collaboration with National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad. It has conducted 1.7 million Covid-19 tests so far.
According to the memorandum of understanding, provision of funds to the laboratory is the responsibility of the health department but of late, it has been facing issues of finances that can negatively impact the province’s response to public health issues.
The official said that they had received last funding from the health department in 2021 that had already exhausted and the operations of the laboratory couldn’t be continued beyond the ongoing month.
During the last meeting, held with the health adviser to caretaker chief minister in the chair, provision of funds to the laboratory was recommended to tackle the problem of mpox.
According to the letter, the director has sought immediate release of funds so that the laboratory can be kept functional not only to ensure surveillance of mpox but other ailments which are occurring in the province. Timely diagnosis, he said, was required to prepare for all communicable diseases’ surveillance and testing.
The meeting had decided that the annual grant of PHRL should be part of the regular budget of the health department in order to conduct testing of all ailments without any hindrance. PHRL has tested seven samples of suspected mpox patients so far. However, all of them were negative.

The street crime fell sharply after Ramazan 15 as the Ababeel Squad and City Patrol Force stepped up patrols in those areas,” a police official said.
He also said that the police traced the majority of the snatched phones and found out that they’re transported to Afghanistan.
On May 4, the city police arrested 19 people for allegedly committing robberies in Pishtakhara, University Town, Tehkal, Sarband, Gulberg and Tatara areas claiming that the detainees belonged to Afghanistan and Kohat, Khyber and Peshawar districts.
