0,Fulham hit Leicester for five to dent survival hopes,Leicester are outside the relegation zone only on goal difference.,"LONDON: Leicester City’s chances of Premier League survival suffered a blow as they collapsed to a 5-3 at Fulham on Monday.
Willian and Tom Cairney both scored twice for the Cottagers as they closed in on a top-half finish on their return to the top flight.
But the Foxes, who won the Premier League in stunning fashion in 2016 and lifted the FA Cup two years ago, are staring relegation in the face.
Leicester are outside the relegation zone only on goal difference.
They could end the day in the bottom three should Everton win at Brighton & Hove Albion and Notting­ham Forest pick up at least a point at home to Southampton.
Only Leeds United and Bourne­mouth have conceded more goals than Leicester in the Premier League and defensive deficiencies were again their undoing at Craven Cottage.
Willian’s free-kick from out wide was allowed to sail beyond everyone to open the scoring just 10 minutes in.
Fulham were still without top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic, serving an eight-game ban for pushing a referee.
But his deputy Carlos Vini­cius was given acres of space to run in behind the Leicester defence and fire home the second from Harry Wilson’s pass.
Two cool finishes from Cairney either side of half-time then made it 4-0 before the visitors’ showed what they are capable of going forward.
Harvey Barnes fired home from James Maddison’s pass and Leicester could have been back in the game but Jamie Vardy’s penalty was saved by Bernd Leno.
Fulham went up the other end to make it 5-1 as Willian smashed home another strike from outside the box.
Maddison had seen a penalty saved in a 2-2 draw with Everton last week, but found the net when he took back responsibility from Vardy for Leice­ster’s second penalty of the afternoon.
Barnes then pounced to make it 5-3 after a calamitous defensive mix-up between Shane Duffy and Leno.
But it was too little, too late for Leicester who face an anxious wait to see where they will sit in the table before they are in action again in a week’s time against Liverpool.
DE GEA ERROR GIFTS WEST HAM VICTORY
In Sunday’s late match, a howler by Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea gifted West Ham three vital points in their battle against relegation as the  hosts secured a 1-0 win at the London Stadium.
United  are fourth on 63 points after 34 games, one ahead of Liverpool and with  a game in hand over the Merse­ysiders, while West Ham are 15th on 37  points, seven above the drop zone.
Visiting forwards Marcus  Rashford and Antony hit the post in the first half but De Gea’s error  will capture the headlines as it reopened the chase for Champions League  places.
Said Benrahma’s bouncing shot from distance looked to be  no real threat but although Spaniard De Gea dived and got a hand to it  he failed to keep the ball out as West Ham took the lead.
The goal knocked  the wind out of United’s sails and they were lucky not to concede a  penalty when Victor Lindelof moved his arm into the path of a ball from  Benrahma, with VAR deciding not to recommend a spot kick as the first  half came to a close.
With  United striker Wout Weghorst ineffective, Anthony Martial added a  much-needed focal point for their attack when he came off the bench in  the 57th minute.
Rashford forced a quick reaction stop from Lukasz  Fabianski and Martial also had an effort saved as United increased the  pressure, with Martial also flashing a stoppage-time header across the  face of the goal.
Despite 10 minutes of stoppage time, United  could not score and they slum­ped to a second league defeat in a row  after losing at Brighton.

The win gives Pakistan U-19 a 2-0 lead in the five-match one-day series against Bangladesh U19.
Put into bat first, Pakistan U-19 were dismissed for 271. Azan, who returned undefeated on 69 in Pakistan U-19’s nine-wicket win over Bangladesh in the first one-day, scored 105 today. His innings included 15 fours which came off 125 deliveries.
After the departure of Shahzaib Khan, Azan was involved in a 57-run partnership with Shamyl Hussain (33 off 49) for the second wicket and later combined with captain Saad Baig (51 off 64) for the third wicket.
Saad’s dismissal with the score at 193 was followed by a batting wobble that saw the tourists lose six wickets for 42 runs, leaving them in a spot of bother at 235-9 in 46.5 overs. Amir Hassan was then joined by Aimal Khan and the pair knitted 36-run partnership for the 10th wicket. Amir scored 29 off 18 deliveries, which included two fours and as many sixes. Aimal struck two fours in a seven-ball 13.
For Bangladesh U-19, Iqbal Hossain Emmon was the most successful bowler, taking four wickets for 72 runs. Mahfuzur Rahman Rabby bagged three wickets for 52 from nine overs.
In turn, the visitors never allowed the hosts to score freely as the latter were bundled out for 193 in 47 overs. Only Shihab James (42 off 63) and Adil Bin Siddik (40 off 61) were the notable run-getters for the losing team.
For Pakistan U-19, right-arm fast bowler Ismail took three wickets for 46, while Ali Asfand, Arafat Minhas and Aimal Khan snapped two wickets each.
Scores in brief: 
PAKISTAN U-19 271 in 50 overs (Azan Awais 105, Saad Baig 51, Shamyl Hussain 33, Amir Hassan 29; Iqbal Hossain Emmon 4-72, Mahfuzur Rahman Rabby 3-52); BANGLADESH U-19 193 in 47 overs (Shihab James 42, Adil Bin Siddik 40; Mohammad Ismail 3-46, Ali Asfand 2-18, Arafat Minhas 2-44, Aimal Khan 2-50).

2,Alcaraz ‘at the door’ to top spot after Madrid Open defence,MADRID: Carlos Alcaraz celebrated  “being almost at the door” of becoming the top-ranked tennis player in the...,"MADRID: Carlos Alcaraz celebrated  “being almost at the door” of becoming the top-ranked tennis player in the world again after defending his Madrid Open title here on Sunday.
The Spaniard earned his 10th career title with a hard-fought 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win over Jan-Lennard Struff and can reclaim the world number one ranking from Novak Djokovic simply by playing a single match at the Rome Masters next week, before the French Open.
Currently ranked second, Alcaraz spent 20 weeks in the top spot after his US Open triumph in September, becoming the youngest player to reach world number one.
Djokovic’s Australian Open triumph saw him depose Alcaraz but the 20-year-old confirmed he would play next week in the Italian capital.
“These are very nice achievements, winning my fourth Masters 1000, defending my title here and being almost at the door of recovering the number one spot,” Alcaraz told a news conference.
“These are very big things I’m doing, and I’m very proud of the work and of these accomplishments. I am ambitious and we’ll try and go for Rome.”
Alcaraz continued his Roland Garros build-up by adding the Madrid trophy to victories in Barcelona, Buenos Aires and Indian Wells this year, although he was below his best against lucky loser Struff, the world number 65.
The triumph and his impending return to the top of the rankings reiterated his bright future at the game’s summit.
Alcaraz said his only worry for his future in tennis is injury, rather than any mental aspects.
“You have to try to take care of yourself as much as possible,” said Alcaraz.
“The mental issue, of getting tired of winning, travelling or playing tennis, doesn’t worry me because I know it’s not going to happen.
“What may worry me in the future is the issue of injuries, which is what we are going to try to take care of together with my team.” 
Alcaraz was given a tricky time by his German opponent but eventually became the youngest player since Rafael Nadal in 2006 to defend an ATP Masters 1000 title.
Despite being 13 years Alcaraz’s senior, Struff showed nerves in the first game and conceded a break in only his second tour-level final.
Struff soon found his range and broke to love for 2-2 as he showed Alcaraz he would be no pushover, despite the strong home support and their disparity in ranking, and then won a third consecutive game.
However, Alcaraz broke again for a 4-3 lead and survived a triple break point to win the first set.
Struff’s power game created plenty of problems of Alcaraz — hitting 14 winners in the first set to the Spaniard’s seven.
“I knew bombs would come my way, Jan is very aggressive,” said Alcaraz.
Struff roared into a 3-0 lead in the second set and produced a remarkable hold in the 15-minute fifth game for 4-1, saving five break points as Alcaraz’s hitting deserted him.
The 33-year-old served it out as Alcaraz dropped only his second set of the tournament and first in a Masters 1000 final.
However the top seed broke for a 3-1 lead in the third set and it proved decisive, Alcaraz eventually clinching victory when his opponent sent a backhand long.
“Of course I wanted to go all the way to win today, but I would definitely say if someone told me two weeks ago you’re gonna play the finals, I would take it,” said Struff who had initially lost in qualifying last weekend before being awarded a ‘lucky loser’ slot in the main draw following injury pull-outs.

3,PSG close on Ligue 1 title with win at Troyes,PARIS: Paris St Germain moved a step closer to retaining the Ligue 1 title with a 3-1 win at second-bottom Troyes...,"PARIS: Paris St Germain moved a step closer to retaining the Ligue 1 title with a 3-1 win at second-bottom Troyes thanks to goals from Kylian Mbappe, Vitinha and Fabian Ruiz on Sunday.
The win took PSG to 78 points from 34 games, six points clear of Lens and eight in front of Olympique de Marseille with four more rounds of games remaining this season.
Lens beat Marseille 2-1 to leapfrog them on Saturday.
PSG need seven more points to guarantee a record 11th French title.
Mbappe scored in the eighth minute after a Vitinha cross was deflected onto the top of the bar by defender Erik Palmer Brown before the striker waited for it to drop and headed home.
Vitinha made it 2-0 before the hour when he headed a lofted pass by Marco Verratti that keeper Gauthier Gallon parried back against the Portuguese with the ball rebounding into the net.
Xavier Chavalerin pulled a goal back for Troyes in the 83rd but Ruiz restored PSG’s two-goal advantage three minutes later with a fine left-foot strike into the top corner after the ball rebounded to him when Mbappe’s close-range shot was saved.
“We know it was a difficult match against a well-organised team and we did well, creating chances and goals,” said Vitinha.
FOUR-GOAL LACAZETTE
Earlier, former Arsenal forward  Lacazette had a remarkable day, scoring four goals including a penalty  with the last kick of the match as Lyon fought back from three goals  down to beat Montpellier 5-4.
In an extraordinary game, Elye Wahi also scored four goals for the  visitors, who led 4-1 after 55 minutes.
Lyon made the most of  slips on Saturday by Lille and Rennes, the teams above them, to lift  themselves into the European qualification picture.
The  31-year-old Lacazette headed his side ahead in the 30th minute.
But  Wahi profited from errors by midfielder Johann Lepenant and a foul by  Dejan Lovren which yielded a penalty before pouncing on another error to  chip the ball over goalkeeper Anthony Lopes and run on to put  Montpellier 4-1 ahead.
Lacazette started the fightback in the 59th minute, running onto Bradley Barcola’s cross to score.
Lovren headed a goal in the 70th minute and Lacazette equalised from another Barcola assist in the 82nd minute.
Nine  minutes into added time Lyon’s last chance of victory seemed to have  gone when Barcola blazed over. With time up, referee Clement Turpin  reviewed the buildup and ruled that Christopher Jullien had wrestled  Lacazette to the ground.
The striker drilled home the penalty to complete a memorable comeback win.
The result brought Lyon three points behind Lille who occupy fifth place.
In the night’s other fixture, fourth-placed Monaco pulled five points clear of Lille with a 2-1 win at Angers.
Nantes meanwhile continued their slide towards Ligue 2 as they lost 2-0 at home to relegation rivals Strasbourg.
They remain 17th in the 20-team league, but this season four clubs go down as Ligue 1 will shrink to 18 clubs next season.
After starting the day trailing Strasbourg only on goal difference, Nantes are two points behind 16th-placed Auxerre.

4,Sultan tops national snooker rankings,KARACHI: Veteran Pakistan cueist Sultan Mohammad has climbed to the top of the ladder after winning the national...,"KARACHI: Veteran Pakistan cueist Sultan Mohammad has climbed to the top of the ladder after winning the national title earlier this year at the age of 42.
Karachi-based Sultan, who finished as runner-up in 2012 nationals, had to wait for 11 years to enter his name in the annals of the game as national champion.
He failed to get enough challenge on the path to success in the country’s premier event. Considering his age, it has not come as a good omen for the game which was visible by his performance in the regional event held at Doha in March.
It is pertinent to mention that Pakistan could only win three bronze by virtue of reaching the semis in World Team event, World Snooker Championship and low-profile SAARC contest since October last year.
According to the latest national rankings released by the Pakistan Billiards and Snooker Federation (PBSF), Islamabad’s Shan Namat who finished runner-up in the national event, has attained his career-best second spot and is followed by Owaisullah and Shahid Aftab, both from Punjab, respectively.
Ahsan Ramzan, who reached the zenith by capturing the world snooker title at Doha in March last year, has since been able to muster only two bronze out of seven global events. Such has been his fall from grace that he could not proceed beyond group stage in the 47th National Snooker Championship and finished a poor 28 out of 32.
Senior cueist Babar Masih has relegated to 20th position while Haris Tahir is trailing at 24 in the national rankings.
Meanwhile, the PBSF has also released the schedule of international events, due to take place in 2023, as announced by regional and global bodies of the cue sports. 
Despite the passing of five months, the PBSF has not yet issued the domestic calendar.
In a noticeable setback for the game and players in the country, no domestic event could take place last year for the very first time.
Meanwhile, a PBSF official called on Shoaib Khoso, the new DG of the Pakistan Sports Board, in Islamabad recently and apprised him of the matters pertaining to the game.

“Leo Messi returns to training Monday morning,” tweeted the club along with a photo of the 35-year-old in action.
His return makes it likely he will feature in PSG’s home match with relegation-threatened Ajaccio next Saturday.
He was suspended by the Qatar-owned club after failing to turn up for training last Monday.
Instead, the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner travelled to Saudi Arabia without PSG’s permission to fulfil commitments as part of a contract with the country’s tourist office.
Messi subsequently apologised in a video posted on Instagram.
“I had organised this trip to Saudi Arabia having cancelled it previously.
This time I couldn’t cancel it. I am sorry for what I did and I wait to see what the club decides to do.”

On Sunday, Pakistan for the first time earned top spot replacing India with 67.31 Victory Points (VPs) against the visitors’ 66.08.
However on Monday, the third day of the championship, India bounced back to accumulate 106.97 VPs, leaving behind the hosts (97.31) in second place.
There was no change in other positions as the UAE (86.44 VPs), Jordan (82.80) and Bangladesh (76.48) occupied third, fourth and fifth places, respectively.
The position on the women’s side remained the same as India kept the lead with an overall score of 112.13 VPs, followed by Pakistan (111.80) in second place. The UAE (82.19), Jordan (74.34) and Pakistan (68.54) are standing from the third to six places.

The flagship event of the men’s game in the Asia-Pacific region was among many international sporting fixtures stopped by Beijing’s strict anti-virus measures over the past few years.
International sports bodies have sought to bring back such events since those restrictions were lifted in December.
“We are very confident this is the moment we will start a new journey... for tennis in China,” ATP CEO Massimo Calvelli said at a launch ceremony.
Elite women’s tennis is also returning to China after the WTA abandoned in March a boycott it had imposed over concerns for the safety of player Peng Shuai.

8,Nadal missing French Open would be ‘brutal’ for the sport: Federer,MIAMI: Roger Federer said he hopes Rafa Nadal will recover in time for the French Open and that it would be a...,"MIAMI: Roger Federer said he hopes Rafa Nadal will recover in time for the French Open and that it would be a  “brutal” blow for tennis if the 14-time Roland Garros champion is absent this year.
Nadal has been dealing with a hip injury he suffered at the Australian Open in January, and fears that the Spaniard may miss the Paris Grand Slam grew after he pulled out of this week’s Italian Open.
Nadal skipped last week’s Madrid Open and also missed tournaments at Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo and Barcelona.
“It would be brutal, it would be tough for tennis if Rafa isn’t going to be there,” 20-times Grand Slam winner Federer told Sky Sports on Sunday at Formula One’s Miami Grand Prix.
“I still hope so, I saw he pulled out of Rome so I wish him the best.
“Obviously Novak (Djokovic) hasn’t been playing that much so I hope he’s going to be strong as well and then all the young guys coming through as well,” added Federer, who retired from tennis last year.
Nadal has competed at the French Open every year since winning the first of his men’s record 22 major titles in Paris in 2005. The claycourt major begins on May 28.

9,Verstappen’s tyre gamble pays off with Miami triumph,MIAMI: Max Verstappen produced a tyre management masterclass to outwit Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez and win the...,"MIAMI: Max Verstappen produced a tyre management masterclass to outwit Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez and win the Formula One Miami Grand Prix on Sunday, reaffirming his status as the man to beat for the drivers championship.
The win — Red Bull’s fifth from five races this season — extends  Verstappen’s lead at the top of the standings to 14 points and follows  his triumph in the inaugural Miami race last year.
The 1-2 for Red Bull is their fourth in five races so far this year  as the team utterly dominate the sport leaving their rivals to battle  for the third podium position.
Aston Martin’s Spanish veteran  Fernando Alonso took third for his fourth podium in five races this  season as he continues to enjoy his late career revival.
As the reigning double world champion on F1’s dominant team, Verstappen had already been installed as the favourite but coming into Miami all the indicators were trending in his team-mate’s direction.
Perez was riding the momentum from a win in Baku and is regarded as an expert on street circuits and tyre management, both factors that would come into play on the 5.41km temporary track around Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins.
But in the end it was Verstappen who made all the right calls — from tyre selection to race strategy.
Starting ninth on the grid, the 25-year-old Dutchman ripped through the pack and was on pole-sitter Perez’s exhaust before the race had reached the midway point.
Perez, who started on medium tyres, pitted first, giving Verstappen an extended run at the front where he squeezed everything he could from his hard tyres before finally stopping for a change with just 11 laps to go.
The stop handed the lead back to his Mexican team-mate, but not for long. On fresher tyres, Verstappen was immediately on the prowl and two laps later he was in front of Perez again.
From there it was business as usual, the two Red Bulls easing through the final laps unchallenged for another one-two.
“This is something I wanted already yesterday together with my engineer,” Verstappen said of his tyre selection.  “We were quite strongly opinionated on that already.
“Then you have to discuss with the team, with the team’s interest.
“They were like, ‘Okay.’   “But when you start on the hard, the risk is a bit higher because we only had one (set).
“So if you have a ... puncture or whatever, then your race is a bit tougher.
“But I was happy to take that gamble.”

10,Kishan replaces Rahul in India squad for WTC final,Rahul was ruled out of the rest of the Indian Pre­mier League season and the WTC final after tearing a tendon in his right leg.,"MUMBAI: Ishan Kis­han will replace the injured K.L. Rahul in India’s squad for next month’s World Test Championship (WTC) final against Australia, the Indian cricket board (BCCI) said on Monday.
Rahul was ruled out of the rest of the Indian Pre­mier League (IPL) season and the WTC final after tearing a tendon in his right leg while fielding for the Lucknow Super Giants. 
“After consultations with specialists, it has been decided that Rahul will undergo surgery at the earliest followed by rehab at the National Cricket Academy for the same,” the BCCI said. “The All-India Senior Selection Committee has named Ishan Kishan as KL Rahul’s replacement.” 
Kishan, who has represented India in shorter formats, was named in the Test squad for the first two games of a four-match series against Australia in February but is yet to make Test debut for India.
The BCCI added that Jaydev Unadkat and Umesh Yadav, both of whom are in the squad for the WTC final, are being monitored after picking up injuries in recent weeks. The WTC final takes place at the Oval from June 7-11. 
Squad: Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Ishan Kishan, KS Bharat (wicket-keeper), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Shardul Thakur, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Umesh Yadav, Jaydev Unadkat.

11,City turn to Haaland as difference maker on Real revenge mission,The addition of Haaland could be the difference-maker for Pep Guardiola’s team this time as they travel to the Santiago Bernabeu for the first leg.," 

MADRID: Real Madrid players Mariano Diaz (second L), Toni Kroos (third L), Jesus Vallejo (second R) and Lucas Vazquez (R) along with other team-mates undergo physical exercises at the club’s training ground on Monday.—Reuters

MANCHESTER: Two of the best attacking teams in Europe face off in the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday, with Manchester City’s record-seeking Erling Haaland going against Real Madrid’s red-hot trio of Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo Goes and Karim Benzema.
It will be a rematch of last year’s semi-final, when Real got the better of a City team that didn’t have Haaland in the squad. City fell short of European success yet again, while Real went on to win a record-extending 14th title.
The addition of Haaland could be the difference-maker for Pep Guardiola’s team this time as they travel to the Santiago Bernabeu for the first leg.
City seemed set for a second consecutive final when they led 5-3 on aggregate heading into stoppage time of the second leg at the Bernabeu last season.
But they were stunned by two goals in two minutes by Rodrygo before Karim Benzema’s penalty completed the comeback in extra-time. A late defensive collapse was only part of the story. City also paid for not taking a series of chances to kill the tie off over both legs without a natural goalscorer.
 

MANCHESTER: Erling Braut Haaland of Manchester City runs during a training session at the Etihad Campus on Monday.—Reuters

Less than a week later, City announced they had won the race to arguably the greatest guarantee of goals in the world right now by beating off Madrid to sign Haaland.
The Norwegian has more than justified the hype with 51 goals in all competitions and with the high likelihood of more to come.
After years of near misses in the Champions League, City are hoping the prolific 22-year-old is the last piece of the jigsaw as they look to finally land the big prize.
He has revelled in Europe — scoring 12 of City’s 26 goals in the Champions League this season, not least when he fired five past RB Leipzig in the last 16 and then struck in both quarter-final legs against Bayern Munich.
But Real coach Carlo Ancelotti isn’t too fixated on Haaland and said his plan was to try and foil City’s “unstoppable” team.
“Obviously Haaland is a very dangerous player. He’s showing impressive qualities, above all in goalscoring. He’s a threat obviously,” Ancelotti told a news conference on Monday.
“Just talking about Haaland means not talking about a complete team that plays good football, defends well, attacks, that has ideas. We’re not setting up for a game to stop Haaland, but to stop a team that seems unstoppable, but I think we can have chances to have an equal game, one that we can win.”
Haaland, who has a Pre­mier League-record 35 goals this season, added a new dimension to a City attack that played most of last season without a striker. Instead of focusing on always dominating possession, Guar­diola has been happy to use Haa­land as a weapon on the counterattack at times.
Ancelotti admitted City have more avenues to cause danger with Haaland in the side.
“It’s a more complete team than last year,” said the Italian. “Today, they can take advantage more of long balls, because they have a very tall striker, and behind him is [Kevin] De Bruyne, so they can win balls in the air. They have not changed their style, they are very well organised at the back and a team that handles the ball very well.”
Real will stick to the formula that has worked well in recent years, with Viní­cius, Benzema and Rodrygo taking turns to lead an attack that scored 25 goals in the Champions League this season — 15 of them coming from the trio. They scored eight of the team’s 10 goals in the knockout stage alone. Last season, Vinicius, Benzema and Rodrygo combined for all six of Real’s goals as they advanced past City.
Rodrygo is coming off a two-goal performance in the 2-1 win over Osasuna that gave Real the Copa del Rey title on Saturday. Vinicius had an assist and continued to play at a top level. Benzema had a hat-trick in Real’s 4-2 win against Almeria in the previous La Liga round.
With the Copa title secured and La Liga out of reach, Real can fully focus on the matchup against City.
City, meanwhile, are closing in on matching Manchester United’s feat of being the only side to win the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup in the same season in 1998/99.   Three wins from their final four games will retain the Premier League title for a third consecutive season.
United will have their shot at stopping the treble in the FA Cup final on June 3 but most see Real as the biggest hurdle left for Guardiola’s men to scale with either AC Milan or Inter Milan awaiting the winners in the Champions League final. The Premier League leaders are unbeaten in 20 games in all competitions and will also relish having home advantage for the second leg having won all 14 games at the Etihad in 2023.
Real’s veteran midfielder Toni Kroos stressed the importance of taking their chances if they are to beat a well-oiled machine like City. “We must play well and score goals. As simple as that,” Kroos told a news conference. “To be solid on defence is also important when you face a rival who scores three goals every game. We need to score, but I trust in the experience we have in games like this.”

12,Pakistan hoping to play more ODIs before World Cup: Babar,"KARACHI: Pakistan would like to play as many matches as possible before the ICC Men’s Cri­cket World Cup, which ...","KARACHI: Pakistan would like to play as many matches as possible before the ICC Men’s Cri­cket World Cup, which is schedule to be held in India in October-November, the nati­onal side’s captain Babar Azam has said.
Pakistan’s home season that started back in March last year saw the team play lose only two of their 14 One-day International matches before it concluded with the final game of the five-match series against New Zealand here at the National Bank Stadium on Sunday.
Although the hosts lost the game by 47 runs, they did so only after being 4-0 up. The defeat, however, saw Pakistan drop down two places from the number one spot in the format’s rankings, only two days after achieving it.
The five matches nonetheless gave Pakistan the opportunity to go about their job with one eye on the World Cup.
“All matches that we’ve played and that we will play before the World Cup are very important for us,” Babar said in the post-series press conference.  
“We’re trying to utilise them fully. We’ve tried different combinations and tested our bench strength throughout the course of this series to gauge where we stand and to identify how we can maximise the potential of each player.”
Trying varying combinations and giving the players — who generally warm the bench — the chance to prove their mettle was a strategy that worked well for Pakistan by the end of the series.
Having lost middle-order Haris Sohail to injury ahead of the series saw Pakistan replace him with hard-hitting batter Iftikhar Ahmed, who did not disappoint.
The right-hander plundered the New Zealand bowlers for 94 off 72 balls in a knock that eventually failed to take Pakistan over the line but definitely helped them find a batter for the crucial number six position in the batting order.Iftikhar was assisted by Salman Agha as the batters combined for a 97-run partnership that took the match deep.
“We’ve given him [Iftikhar] a chance due to the performances he has shown in the last four to five months and the spot in the batting order that he is thriving was one that we’ve been struggling with in the recent past,” said Babar. “So him and Salman Ali Agha are proving to be really helpful for us and I hope they keep this up.”
Babar, however, said the final squad for the World Cup is yet to be decided.
“We have a list of 15-20 players, who we think we can take to the World Cup and we will reveal it when the event is near,” said the 28-year-old, who played his 100th ODI on Sunday.
Pakistan’s schedule ahead of the World Cup is still uncertain with the Asia Cup, which is to be played in September in Pakistan under the cloud due to India’s reservations over travelling across the border.
Pakistan are also scheduled to play three one-dayers against Afghanistan in August but for that as well the dates are yet to be confirmed. 
Moreover, where Pakistan will play their World Cup matches given the side’s concerns over security in India, is also undecided so far.
“We can’t say anything about that, but wherever we get a chance to play, we will play,” Babar said of the uncertain 
situation.

MELFI: Australian Michael Matthews timed his final effort to perfection to win a rain-affected stage three at the Giro d’Italia on Monday, following a 216-km ride from Vasto to Melfi.
Matthews and Mads Pedersen were neck-and-neck until the final corner, but the Australian, who was set up perfectly by his Jayco-AlUla team, moved in front on the home stra­ight to emerge victorious.
TrekSegafredo’s Peder­sen finished second, ahead of Kaden Groves (Alpe­cinDeceuninck) and Vin­cenzo Albanese (EOLO-Kometa).
Corratec-Selle Italia riders Alexander Konychev and Veljko Stojnic were the early pace-setters, leading the stage for the first half of the race, before being reeled in by the main group with 36km to go.
Belgian Evenepoel extended his lead after taking three bonus seconds to tighten his grip on the leader’s maglia rosa jersey, while Joao Almeida moved up to second.
Primoz Roglic, who was eclipsed by rival Evenepoel in the intermediate sprint, climbed to third.
