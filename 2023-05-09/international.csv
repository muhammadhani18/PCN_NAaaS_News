0,Film on women converts joining IS banned in West Bengal,NEW DELHI: The government of West Bengal on Monday banned a movie critics accused of stoking communal hatred and...,"NEW DELHI: The government of West Bengal on Monday banned a movie critics accused of stoking communal hatred and propaganda against Muslims, but defended strongly by the right-wing ruling coalition.
The film, The Kerala Story, claims that 32,000 Hindu and Christian women from the mixed-faith state of Kerala have converted to Islam, and that some were recruited by the militant Islamic State (IS) group. Critics have called the film out for peddling lies aimed at fomenting communal polarisation and unrest. 
But the movie has been endorsed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and seized on by Hindu hardliners who say its portrayal is accurate. 
The state of West Bengal, which has a larger population than Germany, banned the movie on Monday, with chief minister Mamata Banerjee — whose party opposes Modi, — slamming it as a “distorted story”. 
“This is to avoid any incident of hatred and violence, and to maintain peace in the state,” she told reporters in Kolkata. 
The trailer for the film initially claimed that thousands of women had fled their homes “to be buried in the deserts”,  but as controversy mounted it was edited to say it was a story about three women from Kerala. 
But the closing credits still say it is “dedicated to the thousands of girls in Kerala and Mangalore who didn’t come back home after their conversions”. 
Anurag Thakur, India’s information minister, said the film showed “the reality of IS” and that by banning it, West Bengal was effectively siding with terror outfits that “lure women with love”. 
“Everyone must see this movie to understand the agenda of these terror outfits who operate globally, but do their recruitment in some parts of India,” Thakur told broadcaster India Today. 
Indian authorities have not previously expressed concern that thousands of their citizens may have joined IS, a prospect which would alarm counter-terrorism experts. 
Multiplexes in the southern state of Tamil Nadu have also stopped the screenings of the movie fearing violence and unrest. 
The controversy comes after The Kashmir Files, about Hindus fleeing India-occupied Kashmir in 1989-90, last year saw incidents of people in cinemas calling for revenge killings of Muslims. 
India banned the screening of a BBC documentary about Modi’s role during killings in Gujarat in 2001, calling it “hostile propaganda and anti-India garbage”.

1,Russia to ‘develop’ its military facilities in Kyrgyzstan,Kyrgyzstan President Sadyr Japarov meets Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Moscow.,"MOSCOW: Russia will “develop” its military installations in Central Asian ally Kyrgyzstan, the Kremlin said on Monday, following talks between the two countries’ leaders in Moscow. 
“The heads of state emphasised the importance of strengthening the Kyrgyz Republic’s armed forces and developing Russian military facilities on its territory,” the Kremlin said in a statement. 
Kyrgyzstan, a majority-Muslim country of nearly seven million people, hosts a Russian military base made up of an airfield, a naval installation on Lake Issyk-Kul and several other sites. 
President Sadyr Japarov met Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday, on the eve of Victory Day, a Soviet war anniversary to be marked by an army parade through Red Square. 
Japarov will be one of several foreign leaders to attend the parade this year. 
Russia and Kyrgyzstan, an ex-Soviet republic, are linked through a Moscow-led military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO). 
According to the statement released by the Kremlin, the two countries also expect to “deepen military and technical cooperation” as well as their economic and cultural relations in order to “reach a new level of integration”.

2,German neo-Nazi jailed for plotting racist attacks,The 21-year-old has been sentence to three years and ten months in jail.,"BERLIN: A 21-year-old German man was found guilty on Monday of attempting to form a neo-Nazi terrorist group inspired by the US-based Atomwaffen Division and planning attacks with guns and explosives.
The young man, named as Marvin E., was sentenced to three years and ten months in jail, the higher regional court in Frankfurt said in a statement.
Marvin E. had taken steps to found a branch of Atomwaffen Division, known for its racist and anti-Semitic ideology, in the German state of Hesse, the court said.
“He had completely adopted their ideology and had decided... to found an independent group with the name ‘Atomwaffen Division Hesse’, based on their ideological model,” it said. The purpose of the group would have been to carry out attacks on politicians, Jews and migrants, according to the court.
Marvin E. had taken steps to acquire firearms, was storing five explosive devices containing steel balls, and had ordered materials on the internet to construct further explosive devices.
He had also researched potential targets in the run-up to his arrest in September 2021.
Founded in 2015, Atomwaffen Division is a violent extremist group with cells in multiple US states.
Its members have been accused of plotting attacks against Jews, Muslims and other purported enemies with an aim of destabilising Western democratic countries.
In the United States, several members of Atomwaffen Division have been jailed for threatening journalists and activists campaigning against anti-Semitism and racism.

3,Convoy carrying diplomats ‘attacked’ in Myanmar,"Indonesian president condemns ""shootout"", vows to push for peace.","YANGON: A convoy of diplomats travelling in Myanmar came under fire from an unknown armed group, a military official and a diplomat said on Monday.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since a military coup deposed Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration in Feb 2021.
On Sunday a convoy of several vehicles travelling in Taunggyi township in eastern Myanmar’s Shan State was attacked by an unknown armed group, a foreign diplomat based in Yangon said on condition of anonymity.
“A convoy with some diplomats was attacked yesterday morning,” the source said.
The convoy was carrying diplomats from the embassies of Indonesia and Singapore and officials coordinating humanitarian relief from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) regional bloc, they added, noting that no casualties were reported. A senior military official who did not want to be named confirmed said that a convoy had been fired on.

Indonesian president condemns ‘shootout’, vows to push for peace

‘Shootout’
The officials and diplomats had been travelling to “hand over humanitarian aid,” Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Monday.
“Regretfully on their way, there was a shootout,” he said, without giving any further details. But said it would not deter efforts by Indonesia and Asean to push for peace in Myanmar.
“Stop using force, stop violence because it’s the people who will be victims. This condition will not make anybody win,” he said, adding that Indonesia encourages all stakeholders to have a dialogue and find solutions.
It was unclear who was behind the incident which, according to Indonesian foreign ministry spokesperson Teuku Faizasyah.
Myanmar’s shadow National Unity Government, which is allied with the anti-junta militias, the People’s Defence Forces (PDF), said it was not involved in the incident.
The PDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesperson for the Myanmar junta did not respond to a request for comment.
Indonesia has for months been quietly engaging the Myanmar junta, shadow government and armed ethnic groups to try and kick-start a peace process, its foreign minister said last week.
Southern Shan state — home to Taunggyi township — has seen relatively little of the violence that has ravaged Myanmar since the coup.
But in March around 30 people sheltering at a monastery in the same state were killed, with the junta and anti-coup fighters trading accusations over the massacre.
Southeast Asian leaders will this week meet in Indonesia for a summit expected to be dominated by the Myanmar crisis.
Long slammed by critics as a toothless talking shop, Asean has led diplomatic attempts to resolve the bloody crisis.
But its efforts have stalled as the junta ignores international criticism and refuses to engage with its opponents, which include ousted lawmakers, anti-coup PDF and ethnic minority armed groups.

4,Tales of horror emerge as ethnic violence ravages Manipur,"Over 50 dead, hundreds hospitalised and 23,000 displaced","ANDRO: Father-of-five S. Mam­ang Vaiphei hid in the jungle for three nights after a mob attacked his village in Manipur, the remote Indian state where ethnic violence has reportedly killed at least 54 people.
Around 23,000 people have fled the unrest which erupted last week in the hilly northeast state bordering Myanmar.
“The Meitei people first burnt down 26 or 27 houses,” Mamang, now sleeping out in the open in an army camp with around 900 others bringing similar horror stories, said.
“Then they came again and finished all 92 houses (in the village), ransacked the church, the school and whatever was left,” the 54-year-old said, surrounded by exhausted and traumatised men, women and children.
The far-flung states of northeast India sandwiched between Bangladesh, China and Myanmar have long been a tinder box of tensions between different ethnic groups as well as a hotbed of separatism.

Over 50 dead, hundreds hospitalised and 23,000 displaced

The latest clashes erupted last week between the majority Meitei people, who are mostly Hindu, living in and around the Manipur capital Imphal and the mainly Christian Kuki tribe of the hills.
The spark was a protest about plans to give the Meitei “Scheduled Tribe” status giving them, in a form of affirmative action, guaranteed quotas of government jobs and college admissions.
Violence erupted in Imphal and elsewhere with protestors setting fire to vehicles and buildings and according to villagers, Meitei mobs armed with guns and petrol cans then attacking Kuki settlements in the hills.
‘Shoot-at-sight’
The military has deployed thousands of troops, issued “shoot-at-sight” orders in “extreme cases”, imposed curfews and cut the internet.
Mamang, spending his fifth night homeless on Sunday, is one of around 23,000 people that the military says it has brought to safety.
He said that on May 4 he fled his village of Kamuching, which had a population of more than 500 people before the unrest, when a “large crowd” starting attacking.
“Everything was on fire... We ran away, all of us ran to the jungle and we try to survive,” he said.
Mostly people only managed to grab a small bag with a few personal belongings, an extra pair of clothes or their smartphones.
In the absence of social media with the internet shutdown — to curb disinformation, which could fuel further tensions — others at the army camp had similar stories.
“Every one of us here, we’re nervous, we’re afraid of death,” said Alun Vaiphei, 50, a Kuki tribal villager from Gotangkot.
“To save our lives, we contacted Assam Rifles, so that they rescued us from our place of hiding,” he said.
In and around Imphal on Sunday, life had come to a standstill, with businesses shut and deserted roads still littered with charred cars.

5,Austrian billionaire’s jewellery collection set to fetch $150m at auction,The collection comprises of more than 100 Bulgari pieces.,"GENEVA: The 700-piece private jewellery collection of the late Austrian billionaire Heidi Horten, the world’s largest and most valuable collection of its kind to come to auction, could sell for more than $150 million, Christie’s said on Monday.
Some of its most spectacular pieces include the 90-carat  “Briolette of India” diamond necklace by Harry Winston, and the  “Sunrise Ruby” and diamond ring by Cartier that is worth up to an estimated $20 million.
The collection, acquired between the early 1970s until Horten’s death last year, is also comprised of more than 100 Bulgari pieces.
Horten’s collection is set to exceed the record sales at Christie’s for Elizabeth Taylor’s collection in 2011 and the Maharajas & Mughal Magnificence auction in 2019, the only two jewellery collections to have garnered more than $100 million.
Christie’s said the estate proceeds of the auctions would go towards the Heidi Horten Foundation, which supports charitable causes including in the fields of health care and child protection. Before agreeing to auction the collection, Christie’s said it had considered the business practices of Mrs Horten’s late first husband, German department store tycoon Helmut Horten, who during the Nazi era  “purchased Jewish businesses that were sold under duress.”   “What’s important is that we have been completely transparent,” Rahul Kadakia, international head of jewellery at Christie’s, said.
“We are selling this collection in its identity with the name Horten. It’s not being sold as an anonymous collection.”  Christie’s said it would make a  “significant contribution” from its final proceeds to Jewish organisations to advance Holocaust research and education. It did not disclose the amount.

6,Climate-resilient farming: funding grows to $13bn,WASHINGTON: Funding for a global initiative aimed at creating more environmentally friendly and climate-resilient...,"WASHINGTON: Funding for a global initiative aimed at creating more environmentally friendly and climate-resilient farming has grown to $13 billion, co-leaders the United States and the United Arab Emirates said 
on Monday.
That money means the Agriculture Innovation Mission (AIM) for Climate, launched in 2021, now exceeds its $10 billion target for the COP28 climate talks, to be hosted by the UAE in November and December.
“Climate change continues to impact longstanding agricultural practices in every country and a strong global commitment is necessary to face the challenges of climate change head-on,” US Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said in a statement.
Vilsack and his Emirati counterpart Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, the UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, are co-hosting an AIM for Climate Summit in Washington this week.
“I think the beauty of this is that of the $13 billion, $10 billion comes from government and three billion is coming from the private sector,” said Almheiri.
Between a quarter and a third of global greenhouse emissions come from food systems, from factors like deforestation to make way for agricultural land, methane emissions from livestock, the energy costs associated with supply chains and energy used by consumers to store and prepare food.
At the same time, the changing climate is threatening food security across the world, as global warming increases the frequency of punishing heat waves, droughts and extreme weather events.
Projects underway include developing newer, greener fertilizers that use less fossil fuels to create, and returning to so-called  “regenerative agriculture” practices that restore soil biodiversity, thus improving both yield and carbon sequestration while reducing the need for fertilisation.
Artificial intelligence-enhanced tools meanwhile are being developed to take data from sources including satellites and ground sensors to then accurately estimate how carbon-rich any given plot of land is, which could help farmers boost soil health or enable the creation of a viable carbon offset market.
Also on the group’s agenda are efforts to adopt more efficient farming techniques and to switch to growing crops that require less water in some climate-impacted areas.
“Black farmers, Indigenous farmers, low-income farmers, they need access to this innovation as well,” former US vice president Al Gore and climate activist told the summit’s opening meeting.

7,Air strikes rock Sudan as truce talks yield no breakthrough,The warring generals have sent representatives to Saudi Arabia for talks on establishing a humanitarian truce.,"KHARTOUM: Air strikes again shook Sudan’s capital on Monday while the latest truce talks in Jeddah yielded no progress and a Saudi diplomat said both sides consider themselves “capable of winning the battle”.
Sudan was thrown into deadly chaos when fighting broke out on April 15 between the forces of army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his deputy turned rival Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who heads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
Battles have since killed hundreds, wounded thousands and uprooted hundreds of thousands, leading to fears of security fallout beyond Sudan’s borders.
The warring generals have sent representatives to Saudi Arabia for talks on establishing a humanitarian truce in an effort also backed by the United States.
Washington and Riyadh have labelled these “pre-negotiation talks”.
By Monday, the discussions had yielded “no major progress”, a Saudi diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
“A permanent ceasefire isn’t on the table... Every side believes it is capable of winning the battle,” the diplomat added.
For Kholood Khair, founder of the Khartoum-based think tank Confluence Advisory, the delegations “are there mostly to curry favour with the Saudis and the Americans, rather than to credibly use this platform as a means to reach an agreement.” 
In Khartoum, a city of five million, terrified residents reported more combat, now in its fourth week, as they tried to cope with power outages and sweltering heat.
A southern Khartoum resident said the family could hear “the sound of airstrikes which appeared to come from near a market in central Khartoum”.
----’Dangerous everywhere’----
The fighting has sparked a mass exodus of foreigners and of Sudanese, in land, air and sea evacuations.
“It’s very dangerous everywhere,” said Rawaa Hamad, who escaped from Port Sudan on an evacuation flight carrying 71 people to Qatar on Monday.
In Sudan, she said, people endure “a lack of everything — a lack of water, lack of fuel, lack of medicine, lack of even hospitals and doctors”.
The battles in the capital and in other parts of the country have killed more than 750 people and injured over 5,000, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project.
In Sudan’s long-troubled western region, almost 200 people have been killed in West Darfur state over the past two weeks, the United Nations said.
It has warned of a widening humanitarian crisis. Fighting has already displaced 335,000 people and created in excess of 120,000 refugees who have fled north into Egypt, west to Chad, and to South Sudan as well as elsewhere, according to the UN.

8,EU cancels reception in Israel over extremist minister’s participation,JERUSALEM: The European Union said on Monday it was cancelling its Europe Day reception in Tel Aviv after the...,"JERUSALEM: The European Union said on Monday it was cancelling its Europe Day reception in Tel Aviv after the extremist Israeli minister representing the government stood firm in his intention to participate.
In a statement, the EU delegation to Israel said it would still celebrate Europe Day on Tuesday but regretted that “this year we have decided to cancel the diplomatic reception, as we do not want to offer a platform to someone whose views contradict the values the European Union stands for.” Reports began emerging in Israeli media on Sunday about the EU’s discontent over National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir’s being the government representative to the Tel Aviv reception.
Israeli government officials confirmed on Monday that Ben-Gvir “was designated (by the government) to attend the EU event”.
Ben-Gvir, who has a history of inflammatory remarks about Palestinians, was charged more than 50 times in his youth with incitement to violence or hate speech. He was convicted in 2007 of supporting a terrorist group and inciting racism.
He has advocated annexation of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where he lives in a Jewish settlement. Such settlements are considered illegal under international law.
Ben-Gvir, head of the far-right Jewish Power party, issued a statement saying he was the assigned representative, and had “confirmed his arrival.” He also provided details on the speech he planned to deliver at the diplomatic reception.
“The minister thinks that even if the EU representatives do not support his opinions, as per their statements, they understand very well that Israel is a democracy, and in a democracy you are allowed to hear other opinions too,” Ben-Gvir’s office said in a statement.
On Monday, a spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said they were “consulting” on what to do regarding the reception.
“We don’t endorse the political views of Mr Ben-Gvir. We don’t endorse the political views of his party because they are in stark contradiction with all the values and principles the EU stands for and believes in,” Peter Stano told reporters in a briefing.
Later in the day, the EU’s Israeli delegation announced it was cancelling the diplomatic reception, but would still hold the “cultural event for the Israeli public” to celebrate “the strong and constructive bilateral relationship.” Following their announcement, Ben-Gvir lashed out at the EU, accusing it of hypocrisy and “undiplomatic mouth-shutting.” Europe Day is the annual celebration of European unity and peace. It marks the anniversary of the 1950 Schuman Declaration, a few years after the end of World War II, which laid the foundation for today’s 27-nation EU bloc.

Witnesses heard the alarm in different parts of the city and saw residents filing out of office and residential buildings, and even a hospital.
Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum announced on Twitter that the alarm had been activated, but there were no reports of an actual earthquake and the ground in the megalopolis never actually started shaking.
“Due to an error derived from maintenance work, the seismic alarm was accidentally activated at 851 locations in Mexico City. We apologise for the inconvenience and impact this incident caused,” the Mexico City government said on Twitter minutes later.
Earthquakes frequently rock Mexico City, sometimes with deadly consequences, and the seismic alarm system often gives residents precious seconds to head to a secure area before the shaking starts.

10,US criticises  Arab League for  readmitting Syria,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Monday criticised the Arab League decision to readmit Syria, saying that President...","WASHINGTON: The United States on Monday criticised the Arab League decision to readmit Syria, saying that President Bashar al-Assad does not deserve normalisation after the brutal civil war.
“We do not believe that Syria merits readmission to the Arab League at this time,” State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
“We continue to believe that we will not normalise our relations with the Assad regime and we don’t support our allies and partners doing so either,” he said.
The United States has repeatedly voiced opposition to reconciliation with Syria and domestic law forbids any assistance for reconstruction without accountability for abuses during the war.
But the Arab League voted on Sunday to welcome back Syria, effectively concluding that Assad had won the war that has killed half a million people and displaced half the pre-war population since 2011.
Patel, however, played down the disagreements and said that the United States shared common objectives with many its Arab partners on Syria.
“We share a number of the same goals with our Arab partners with respect to Syria, including reaching a solution to the Syrian crisis that is consistent with UN Security Council Resolution 2254,” Patel said, referring to the 2015 international bid that set out a roadmap for a political transition.

11,Canada expels Chinese diplomat,OTTAWA: Canada expelled Toronto-based Chinese diplomat Zhao Wei on Monday after an intelligence report accused him ...,"OTTAWA: Canada expelled Toronto-based Chinese diplomat Zhao Wei on Monday after an intelligence report accused him of trying to target a Canadian lawmaker critical of China’s treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority.
“Canada has decided to declare persona non grata Mr  Zhao Wei,” Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in a statement. “The decision has been taken after careful consideration of all factors at play.”  
The expulsion escalates already tense Sino-Canadian relations and is likely to prompt China, Canada’s second-largest trading partner, to respond. The Chinese embassy in Ottawa had no immediate comment.
Spy agency Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) authored a report in 2021 about Chinese influence in Canada that included information about potential threats to Conservative member of parliament Michael Chong and his family.
China says it has never interfered in Canada’s internal affairs and has no interest in doing so. China’s Toronto consulate-general said the report on Chong has “no factual basis and is purely baseless”.  
The Globe and Mail newspaper,, citing an unnamed national security source, said Zhao was involved in gathering information about Chong, who in 2021 sponsored a successful motion declaring China’s treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority genocide.
Chong said he was “profoundly disappointed” to find out about the potential threat to his family in Hong Kong from a newspaper, and criticised Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government for inaction. 
He repeatedly called for Zhao’s expulsion since the Globe report.
Trudeau said he found out about the intelligence report from the newspaper, and on Wednesday blamed the spy agency for not passing it onto him at the time.
The agency has now been directed to immediately pass on information about threats to members of parliament and their families, Trudeau said on Wednesday.
Canadian media outlets have published several reports, citing anonymous intelligence sources, alleging schemes run by the Chinese government to interfere in Canada’s last two elections. Beijing has denied those allegations.

12,The ‘water cops’ of Las Vegas make city a model in drought-hit US,Some 2.3 million people live in the arid Las Vegas Valley.,"LAS VEGAS: Known around the world as an oasis of overindulgence, the desert city of Las Vegas has emerged as a surprising model of austerity and prudence when it comes to water.
Some 2.3 million people live in the arid Las Vegas Valley, and 40 million tourists are drawn each year to its giant casinos and hotels.
Yet because Nevada is allowed to use less than two per cent of the drought-hit Colorado River’s total water, it has taken drastic action, from banning lawns to capping the size of swimming pools.
Even as the region’s population has exploded by more than half in the past two decades, use of the mighty but dwindling river — by far Las Vegas’s main water source — has declined by almost a third.
“Las Vegas has done a very good job selling the facade of excess and decadence,” said Bronson Mack, Southern Nevada Water Authority spokesman.
“But the reality is that our community is extremely water-efficient.” This is due to a package of strict laws, financial incentives and education, created during severe drought in the early 2000s, when Nevada exceeded its river allocation.
Now, at a time when federal officials are mulling mandatory cuts across the parched US West, Las Vegas “has become a water conservation rock star” and “a model for cities” across the region, said researcher Brian Richter.
‘Water cops’
On the Las Vegas Strip, famous casino attractions like the Bellagio’s fountains and the Venetian’s canals use non-potable groundwater from private wells.
Out in the sprawling suburbs, early morning “water patrol” cars with flashing lights crawl the streets, hunting for broken sprinklers and leaky hoses.
Investigators film any violation, before planting a warning flag on the lawn for first-time offenders, or logging a fine for repeat transgressors.
Some homeowners become “a bit frustrated” to find “water cops” on their lawn before dawn, said investigator Cameron Donnarumma, but most are cooperative.
Indeed, his work relies on residents reporting their more water-profligate neighbours via an app, which daily yields 20-50 home visits by patrols.
“People recognise when you land in Las Vegas in the Mojave Desert it is a very dry place,” said Mack. “It is a different environment from where you came from.” By 2027, any watering of “non-functional” grass — there purely for aesthetic rather than recreational reasons — will be banned, except at single-family residences.
Las Vegas offers homeowners $3 for every square foot of grass they remove and replace with water-efficient alternatives, like drip-irrigated plants.
It is a program that has been copied in other major US cities, such as Los Angeles and Phoenix, though smaller towns find it harder to emulate, said Richter.
“Smaller budgets and limited ability to offer financial incentives in smaller cities can severely constrain” water conservation programs, he wrote in a recent study.
‘Political’
The programs are not always popular.
Tedi Vilardo, a Las Vegas stay-at-home mom, said that she has complied with new rules limiting her to watering her lawn for 12 minutes, but is “seeing a ton of dead spots.” “I’m gonna go against the rules,” she said, noting that “we got lots of rain” this winter.
She dislikes fake grass, because she has two children and “it burns their feet.” A recent rule limiting new swimming pools to 600 square feet (56 square meters) has infuriated contractors like Kevin Kraft, who designs giant pools for wealthy homeowners.
The industry was not consulted until the legislation was a “done deal,” and Kraft says a cap based on percentage of a home’s total lot size would save more water.
Nevada officials were “under the gun” from the federal government and “had to show savings,” he said. “A lot of it is political,” he added.
Even so, Kraft described Southern Nevada’s water conservation as “world class.” “Now, the other states such as California? It’s not even close,” he said.
‘Step up’
The rules limiting Nevada’s access to the Colorado River, which supplies water to 40 million people including California’s cities and giant farms, were drawn up in 1922.
Back then, Las Vegas “barely even existed,” said Mack, and was “just a whistle-stop for the train between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City.” Now, with water levels plummeting at nearby Lake Mead -- the nation’s largest reservoir — federal officials are planning steep cuts across the West.
These will either be a uniform percentage reduction for all states, or by “senior rights” — basically, who got there first, which would put Nevada near the back of the line.
Mack said Las Vegas’s record of water reductions “could actually be a challenge for us in the future” if mandated cuts are based on current usage levels.
