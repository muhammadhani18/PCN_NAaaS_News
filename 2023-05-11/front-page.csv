• Asad Umar, Fawad among over 1,900 party supporters held; 52 sent to Adiala
• Radio Pakistan building torched in Peshawar; railways track damaged in Tarnol
• Police property in Lahore, Islamabad destroyed; FC fort in Lower Dir ransacked
ISLAMABAD / PESHAWAR: At least eight people were killed, as many as 290 were injured, and over 1,900 enraged protesters were rounded up in running battles with law enforcers across the country on Wednesday, as an accountability court in Islamabad handed over the custody of their leader Imran Khan to NAB for eight days in connection with the Al Qadir Trust case.
The violent protests provoked by the PTI chairman’s arrest entered the second day on Wednesday, as police and PTI supporters engaged in bloody clashes throughout the day that resulted in damage to several government installations, including police stations.
Late in night, PTI Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry was arrested hours after central Secretary General Asad Umar taken into custody.
In a bid to control the worsening situation, the government called in the military in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad. The deployment came a day after protesters stormed the residence of the corps commander in Lahore and tore down a gate of GHQ in Rawalpindi.
The attacks on army property prompted a harsh statement from its media wing, with its spokesperson calling out the ‘hypocrisy’ of a political group that used the public for its “limited and selfish” interests.
Nevertheless, a police office in Islamabad, a police station in Lahore, Radio Pakistan’s building in Peshawar, and Scouts Fort in Chakkdara, Lower Dir, were set on fire by the mob.
8-day remand
As his supporters rallied for him outside Police Lines in Islamabad, an accountability court was temporarily moved to the police headquarters which handed over the custody of Mr Khan to the NAB officials for interrogation.
The media persons were not allowed to witness the proceedings of the case. According to officials, NAB sought 14-day remand of the former premier, but the court agreed to grant eight-day physical remand.
NAB will interrogate Mr Khan in the sub-jail as it took his custody from the accountability court. According to NAB Deputy Prosecutor General Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi, the NAB chairman can designate the said guest house as sub-jail to detain Mr Khan. He said that under the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), the chairman can designate any place to detain suspects.
Mr Khan was arrested on the high court’s premises and taken to the NAB Rawalpindi office in G-6 on Tuesday.
The IHC chief justice on the petition of Mr Khan held that the arrest was not per se illegal but he questioned the manner in which the former prime minister was taken into custody. The court has also commenced contempt proceeding against the secretary of interior and the IG Islamabad.
In the case, NAB alleged that Khan’s PTI government struck a deal with Malik Riaz that caused a loss of more than $239m to the national exchequer, in a quid pro quid arrangement with the real estate mogul.
No let-up in protests
In Islamabad and Rawalpindi, protests continued throughout the day. A number of protesters gathered at various locations in the federal capital and Rawalpindi to protest the arrest of their party chief.
In Islamabad, more than 17 law enforcers were injured in clashes with protesters whereas the mob set on fire the office of the SP Industrial Area and damaged Ramna police station. The protesters also uprooted a railways track in Tarnol as well.
The Islamabad police registered a number of cases against PTI supporters and detained more than 200 party supporters in the federal capital. In Rawalpindi, the police booked more than 1,500 PTI supporters and detained over 190 workers – 52 were sent to Adiala Jail after they were produced in an anti-terrorism court.
In Lahore, the mob besieged Shadman police station and damaged furniture and official vehicles. The situation in Punjab, particularly Lahore, remained tense in light of violent clashes between police and PTI workers.
A group of PTI supporters attempted to storm the Governor House and CM Secretariat, but they were pushed back by the police. At least 25 government vehicles were burnt while 14 government buildings were stormed by them, according to the police.
Meanwhile, the police claimed to have arrested over 1380 protesters across the province in a crackdown on the former ruling party. The reports claimed that nearly 150 police personnel, including Lahore DIG Operation Nasir Rizvi, three SPs, and dozens of SHOs, were injured in the clashes that erupted with the PTI workers/activists.
In Gujranwala, unknown persons started firing in a protest as a result of which Rashid, son of Maqsood, was killed and several people were injured late on Monday night.
In Lahore, a murder case was registered against the top leadership of the PTI, including Imran Khan, and more than 1200 people at the Gulberg police station. The case was registered in connection with arson at Askari Tower wherein a person reportedly died in the fire.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, violent scenes were abundant, with protesters burning down the building that housed offices of Radio Pakistan and the Associated Press of Pakistan near the KP Assembly.
Peshawar witnessed pitched battles between the police and protesters who were trying to force their way to Khyber Road where key installations were located. The violence in the province left at least seven dead and more than 122 injured.
The police also arrested 274 persons across the province in connection with the violent protests.
Three people were killed and 81 others were injured in clashes in the provincial capital while two others were killed in Kohat. Another protester died and 11 more were injured in Chakkdara where protesters stormed an FC fort late on Tuesday.
Sindh remained relatively peaceful, as Karachi police scuttled a PTI protest. At least 20 people were arrested in the provincial capital in addition to several arrests in Mirpur Khas. In Balochistan, police arrested over 60 local leaders and party workers in Quetta and Chaman a day after violent demonstrations in the provincial capital.

ISLAMABAD: The military has described the events unfolded after PTI chief Imran Khan’s arrest on Tuesday as a “dark chapter”, referring to instances when enraged protesters targeted army property and installations.
“We will not allow anyone to take the law into their hands,” the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), said on Wednes­day in a statement headlined: “May 9 will be remembered as a dark chapter.”
Mr Khan was arrested from the Islamabad High Court “in line with the NAB statement and law”, the military said, referring to the anti-graft body, the National Account­ability Bureau. It said that immediately after Mr Khan’s arrest, the military’s properties and installations were attacked and slogans against the army were raised in an organised manner.
It said that on the one hand these “miscreants” evoked public emotions to achieve their “limited and selfish objectives”, on the other they deceived people while continuing to highlight the army’s importance for the country. This behaviour, the military said, “is an example of hypocrisy”.
In the lust for power, “this group wearing a political cloak” had done what enemies could not do in 75 years, it said.
The ISPR was apparently referring to the incidents of violence in the aftermath of former prime minister’s arrest, especially the way a large number of PTI supporters barged into the residence of Lahore corps commander, and after ransacking it, set the furniture on fire. At the same time, in Rawalpindi another group of PTI supporters barged into the GHQ through the front gate and vandalised the place.
The military said that in the country’s “larger interest”, it showed patience and restraint and exercised extreme tolerance without even caring about its reputation.
“With this situation created under nefarious planning, a heinous attempt was made to make the army give an immediate reaction, which could be used for nefarious political purposes,” it said.
However, a “mature response” by the military “thwarted this conspiracy”, it said, adding: “We are well aware that behind it were orders, directives and complete pre-planning by some sinister party leadership.”
The facilitators, planners and political activists involved in the protests had been identified, it said, asserting that strict action would be taken against them “as per the law and all these evil elements will now be responsible for the consequences”.
“Any further attack on the army, including all law enforcement agencies, military and state installations and properties, will be severely retaliated, the responsibility of which will be on this very group that wants to push Pakistan into a civil war and has expressed it multiple times,” it said.
The military added, “No one can be allowed to incite people and take the law into their hands.”
The ISPR statement came a day after the PTI chief was whisked away by paramilitary forces from the court premises in a case pertaining to the Al Qadir Trust, leading to violent nationwide protests.

2,PM vows to treat rioters with ‘iron hands’,Says damaging public and private properties amounted to terrorist acts.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday vowed to treat rioters with iron hands, as the government deployed troops in Islamabad, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to maintain law and order following violent protests that erupted across the country after the arrest of PTI chief Imran Khan.
“These terrorist and anti-state elements are being warned to desist from taking law into their hands, otherwise they will be dealt with iron hands. Safeguarding the motherland and its ideology is more precious than their lives. We will not let their nefarious designs succeed,” the prime minister said in an address to the nation.
He said the arrest of any leader was never good news but Imran Khan and PTI did not adopt a legal way, rather committed an unforgivable offence of enmity with the country by ransacking sensitive state and private installations.
The prime minister said the rule of law meant facing all the cases legally. Inflicting damages to public and private properties amounted to terrorist acts, he added.
“We have not seen this in 75 years of history of the country that they (PTI workers) attacked state properties like enemies, people were besieged on the roads and vehicles, ambulances were gutted and Swat Motorway (interchange) was des­troyed,” the premier added.
“All are equal before the law; these are the Islamic teachings and the beauty of democracy,” he said while advising the PTI chairman to face the NAB cases legally.

Says damaging public and private properties amounted to terrorist acts

Mr Sharif lauded the role of the army, Rangers and police for showing restraint during violent demonstrations by the PTI workers and protecting people during indiscriminate shooting by the protesters with guns.
He also appreciated the nation for what he called “rejecting the PTI decisions”.
The PM said the NAB arrested Imran Khan according to the law for his involvement in the graft case.
“The NAB arrested Imran Khan legally and on the basis of corruption and corrupt practice in the Al Qadir Trust case, involving a whopping amount of Rs60 billion (£190 million),” he added.
Referring to the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007 and the arrest of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif along with his daughter Maryam Nawaz during the PTI government, the prime minister said on both occasions workers and leaders of PPP and PML-N had shown maturity and avoid any anti-state protest.
“On the killing of Ms Bhutto his husband Asif Ali Zardari had eliminated all anti-state designs by raising a slogan of Pakistan Khappay (Long Live Pakistan),” he added.
The prime minister said he had offered PTI many times for talks, especially for resolving national issues including amendments in NAB laws and negotiations with International Monetary Fund, but all the time rulers were called thieves and looters.
He said the incumbent government had managed to make amendments to NAB laws by curtailing the period of physical remand of the accused from 90 to 14 days and giving him a right of appeal. “Today Imran Khan is the first person who gets benefit from the amendments (as he was sent on physical remand only for eight days),” he added.
They added that the government took the decision to exercise the powers conferred under Article 245 (functions of armed forces) of the Constitution and Section 4 (3) (ii) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (to discharge such functions as specified in the said act).
Deployment of troops
As the federal cabinet decided to call in the army in the urban areas, troops were deployed in Islamabad, Punjab and KP in aid of civil power.
A notification issued by the interior ministry said the exact numbers of troops/assets, date and area of deployment will be worked out by the provincial governments in consultation with the General Headquarters (GHQ).
The ministry’s notifications pertaining to the capital city and the provinces of Punjab and KP said the federal government was “pleased to authorise the deployment of army troops and assets for maintaining the law and order situation across Punjab in aid of civil power”.
Immediately after the interior ministry authorised the deployment of the army in Islamabad, the capital police said that Pakistan Army troops were reaching several locations in Islamabad.

3,Rupee nosedives to 290 vs dollar,"“Neither imports increased nor exports decreased after the arrest of Imran Khan,” says Zafar Paracha.","KARACHI: The US dollar appreciated to an all-time high against the rupee, rising by 1.8 per cent in the interbank market on Wednesday, apparently after the political situation deteriorated further.
The State Bank reported the dollar price at Rs290.22 in the interbank market against the price of Rs284.87 a day before, an increase of Rs5.37, or 1.8pc.
This was the highest dollar price in the banking market.
The previous highest rate was around Rs288, observed earlier this year.
However, the reason for the sudden jump in dollar prices in the banking market was not acceptable to many stakeholders, who accused the banks of again using the deepening political crisis to make money “unlawfully”.
Earlier, the banks were held responsible for artificially increasing the dollar rates to earn profits, and the State Bank had announced that it would penalise these banks.
The uncertainty on the political front deepened after the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan on Tuesday, leading to nationwide protests.
However, this uncertainty does not directly and immediately impact the imports and exports, but the interbank market reacted to benefit from the situation.
“Neither imports increased nor exports decreased after the arrest of Imran Khan,” said Zafar Paracha, general secretary of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan, adding that the jump in the dollar rate was simply profit-making by banks out of this situation.
However, bankers said the dollar rose after demand suddenly increased from importers despite tight controls of the State Bank.
“Since the interbank market is functioning without interference on prices, the latest increase of over Rs5 per dollar is the response of a free-market mechanism,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market.
He said the State Bank influences only to stop the outflow of dollars from the country, which means the opening of letters of credit (LCs) for imports was not free.
However, some senior bankers attributed the dollar’s rise to some other reasons. They said the poor foreign exchange reserves were already a threat to the exchange rate, while the IMF’s delay in releasing the tranche of $1.1 billion made the situation worse for the country.
“Pakistan’s default chances have increased in the next fiscal year, when the country needs over $30bn for debt servicing,” a senior banker said.
The State Bank has about $4.5bn in foreign exchange reserves, barely enough to cover one month’s of imports. Exports are on the decline, while foreign direct investment also dropped during the first nine months of the current fiscal year.
The open market reported the dollar rate at Rs297, around Rs8 higher than the previous day. Currency dealers said it was the reflection of the interbank market, where the prices escalated by Rs5.37.
Analysts and researchers said the exchange would further deteriorate in the coming weeks since the worsening political situation had provided valid reasons for the donors like the IMF to stay away until and unless the situation calms down.
They said Pakistan would not get help from the IMF and other friendly countries, which saved it from default during the current fiscal year.

4,Shehbaz gets clean chit in money laundering case,Prosecutor told to convince court on relevance of new amendments with case.,"LAHORE: The National Account­ability Bureau (NAB) on Wednesday told an accountability court that it found no evidence of corruption or money laundering against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, his family members and others.
A prosecutor submitted a supplementary reference in the court, stating that NAB conducted a fresh investigation and found that the charges against the prime minister, his son Hamza Shehbaz, former chief minister, and others had not been found to be true.
Other accused include PM Shehbaz’s wife Nusrat, younger son Suleman Shehbaz, daughters Javeria Ali and Rabia Imran and son-in-law Haroon Yousaf.
The prosecutor said fresh investigation into the allegations was conducted in light of the new amendments introduced in the National Accountability Ordinance 1999. He said the investigation concluded that no offence under the NAB law was established.

Prosecutor told to convince court on relevance of new amendments with case

Presiding Judge Qamaruz Zaman directed the prosecutor to come up with arguments on May 24 to convince the court on the supplementary reference and the relevance of the new amendments to the instant case.
The judge also extended the pre-arrest bail of accused Haroon Yousaf and Tahir Naqvi till the next hearing.
A pleader attended the hearing on behalf of PM Shehbaz while an application for a one-time exemption from personal appearance was filed on behalf of Hamza, which the judge accepted.
Previously, the court had declared PM Shehbaz’s son Suleman, daughter Rabia Imran and son-in-law Haroon Yousaf, as absconders for avoiding their appearance in the trial proceedings.
Suleman and Yousaf ended their self-exile last year and returned to the country after securing protective bails from the courts.
In this reference, the NAB alleged that the family members and benamidars of PM Shehbaz received fake foreign remittances of billions in their personal bank accounts.
In addition to these remittances, the bureau said, billions of rupees were laundered by way of foreign pay orders, which were deposited in personal bank accounts of his sons Hamza and Suleman.
PM Shehbaz, his elder son Hamza, daughter Javeria Ali have been indicted in the reference besides other accused persons including Fazal Dad Abbasi, Rashid Karamat, Muhammad Usman, Masroor Anwar, Nisar Ahmad, Shoaib Qamar and Qasim Qayum.
Shehbaz’s wife Nusrat has been indicted through a pleader as she is still out of the country.
The NAB had arrested PM Shehbaz on Sept 28, 2020 after the Lahore High Court (LHC) refused to further extend his pre-arrest bail. He remained in the NAB’s custody for 23 days till the trial court sent him on judicial remand on Oct 20, 2020.
A LHC full bench had released PM Shehbaz on bail in April 2021 and observed that the former chief minister of Punjab faced no allegation of receiving kickbacks or ill-gotten money.
A special court in October 2022 had also acquitted PM Shehbaz and Hamza in the Rs16 billion money laundering case filed by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
Allowing their acquittal applications, the court had observed that there was no probability of conviction even if the prosecution evidence collected during the investigation was recorded.
In February last, the FIA also gave a clean chit to Suleman in the money laundering case.
The agency told the trial court that it found no evidence to establish the charges of committing money laundering and receiving kickbacks against Suleman.

5,PTI chief indicted in Toshakhana reference,Former prime minister pleads not guilty,"ISLAMABAD: A trial court seized with the Toshakhana reference framed charges against former prime minister and chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Imran Khan, in a criminal complaint filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for concealing state gifts of Toshakhana.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Humayun Dilawar passed the indictment order. The PTI chairman, however, pleaded not guilty.
Subsequently, the court commenced the formal trial and directed the prosecution to produce evidence to prove allegations.
The proceeding of the case was conducted in the Police Lines Guest House, which has been declared as a sub-jail.

Former prime minister pleads not guilty

The ECP reference stated that Mr Khan “has deliberately concealed his assets relating to Toshakhana gifts retained by him particularly in years 2018 and 2019 when he was the prime minister in the statements of assets and liabilities filed for the years 2017-2018 and 2018-19”.
According to the ECP’s reference, Mr Khan “has deliberately concealed the material facts by not disclosing details of gifts…has also made evasive and ambiguous statement in his written reply that the gifts purchased by him during the financial year 2019-20 were further gifted by him or on his behalf to others.”
Previously, the ECP heard the petitions against Mr Khan on Toshakhana and ruled against the PTI chairman.
The commission then filed a complaint before the sessions court for initiating criminal proceeding.
The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has also initiated separate investigation against Mr Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi for illegally retaining Toshakhana gifts.
In a report submitted to the IHC, NAB stated that Mr Khan and his spouse received 108 state gifts from August 2018 to April 2022. They retained 58 gifts against Rs38 million.

6,Govt urged to restore internet as shutdown disrupts lives,Stakeholders say network outage creates more problems than it solves.,"

AN announcement on an online food and grocery delivery platform informs customers about its limited service because of network outage. —Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

 
ISLAMABAD: Citizens and businesses have urged the government to restore mobile data services, insisting that its absence was leading to great economic costs, affecting millions of citizens who have come to rely on the internet for everything from earning a living to paying bills to buying groceries.
The government suspended internet services on Tuesday after PTI chief Imran Khan’s arrest sparked violent protests across the country.
In a joint statement, more than 100 members of the business community and civil society said, “We … are deeply troubled by and condemn the recently reported and ongoing use of partial and complete Internet shutdowns, as well as targeted content and app blocking, following the nationwide protests.”
They said such shutdowns and blocking or filtering of internet services “unjustifiably limit the rights of peaceful assembly and freedoms of association and expression”.

Stakeholders say network outage creates more problems than it solves

“Tens of millions of Pakistanis rely on internet-dependent services to connect with each other and to undertake essential business activities. By blocking, filtering, or shutting down these services, the government is eroding civic space; fostering a climate of economic uncertainty and disrupting access to healthcare, emergency services and financial services.”
They said such internet disruptions had a negative impact on Pakistani startups, which attracted more than $700 million in investment during 2022 and 2023 and “are playing a critical role in promoting entrepreneurship, job creation, and digitisation across the economy”.
The affected people, they said, also included the hundreds and thousands of freelancers and digital creators.
“We emphatically call on the government of Pakistan to immediately lift restrictions intended to disrupt or prevent the citizens from accessing and disseminating information online and from communicating safely and securely,” they said. “We also urge the government to recognise internet access as a basic fundamental right which can’t be taken away arbitrarily.”
Apart from the general public, hundreds, if not thousands, of companies have also been affected. Ride-hailing companies like Bykea, Careem and InDrive have taken the brunt, as their users — both drivers and passengers — need mobile data on the go.
“The internet service disturbance was not only a loss for our captains, but the customers also face serious difficulty in getting rides to reach their destinations,” a senior official of a ride-hailing company said.
The blockage has also come to bite online food delivery services like Foodpanda and Cheetay. Apart from hundreds of restaurants working with these companies, some 6,000 home chefs have also suffered.
Digital wallets like JazzCash and Easypaisa have reported that the number of daily transactions had shrunk by a third during the 24 hours after internet services were suspended, as shopkeepers and agents who operate like mini-banks using these wallet services and mostly rely on mobile data.
‘Incalculable inconvenience’
Telecom companies have also slammed the government for suspending mobile internet services.
“Shutting down the internet was not a solution to anything. It creates more problems than it solves,” Jazz Pakistan CEO Aamir Ibrahim tweeted on Wednesday. “For almost 24 hours, 125 million Pakistanis have been without mobile internet — a critical tool in emergencies and productivity.”
Mr Ibrahim also cited a news story by Business Recorder, which quoted sources as saying on Wednesday that telecom operators had suffered Rs820m losses after just one day of internet suspension, whereas the government had itself lost around Rs287m in tax revenue.
He added, “The devastating effect on the economy is quantifiable, but the inconvenience to people is incalculable.”
Muhammad Zohaib Khan, chairman of the Pakistan Software Houses Association, has also strongly criticised the mobile data suspension and described it as a “mindless decision”.
“The IT industry has come to a standstill since Tuesday evening. The internet is our lifeline, our office, our communications infrastructure. The IT industry cannot operate without it,” he said.
He said that the blanket blockage of mobile-based internet services and the slowdown of fixed-line internet in the country due to the emergent political situation was a decision made without consultation.
IT and IT-enabled services (ITeS), Mr Khan said, had already been under pressure due to what he said bad and inconsistent government policies, and the current political turmoil had completely stopped the IT industry’s operations.
He said most IT professionals were working from home due to various reasons like bad law and order situation in some areas and restrictions on women and girls moving around. Besides, those in remote areas had no option but to work from home, he said.
Mr Khan urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and direct the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority to restore internet services immediately.
