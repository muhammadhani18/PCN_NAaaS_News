• Police arrest over 200 PTI supporters, including Asad Umar
• Tarnol railway track uprooted, SP Industrial Area office set on fire
• 190 detained in Rawalpindi
• ex-PTI minister booked for attacking GHQ
ISLAMABAD/RAWALPINDI: Police Lines Chowk at Srinagar Highway remained a battleground for over six hours as PTI supporters made desperate efforts to reach the police headquarters where their party chief Imran Khan was detained and a makeshift court was set up for hearing cases against him.
In order to control the situation, the army was also called under Article 245 at the request of the Islamabad chief commissioner. The deployment was made at different points, including Red Zone, to maintain law and order situation, according to the administration.
The police registered five FIRs at different police stations in connection with violence on Tuesday and also detained PTI leader Asad Umar in addition to over 200 supporters of the PTI from different areas, including the sites of protests. They were being detained at the police headquarters.
Earlier, PTI chief and former prime minister Imran Khan was brought to Police Lines Headquarters after 3am, from an undisclosed location, where he was taken from NAB’s G-6 office. He was detained at the Officers’ Mess of the police headquarters.
The capital administration also set up a court at the ‘New Police Guest House’ at the headquarters for proceedings against Mr Khan in the Toshakhana case. The court was set up inside the Police Lines Headquarters keeping in view the prevailing law and order situation.
Transportation of the PTI chief to a court from the headquarters was considered a tough task for the police and it was feared that it would create a law and order situation in F-8 and G-11/4.
Earlier, a contingent of 1,500 policemen was deployed around the Police Lines headquarters before the PTI chairman was brought there, the officers said, adding that containers were also placed on both sides of Faqir Aipee Road to block access to the headquarters.

Around 12pm, supporters of Imran Khan started reaching the headquarters and a physical confrontation ensued between the police and the protesters. The protesters included people from all strata of society, including women and minors: luxury vehicles, including SUVs, were also found parked on both sides of Srinagar Highway.
Shortly after the confrontation started, the chowk turned into a battlefield as protesters fought pitched battles with the police. The violence continued till this report was filed.
The office of the SP Industrial Area office was also set on fire, the officers said, adding that office records, furniture and vehicles parked inside were burnt down by the protesters.
The protesters armed with slingshots and sticks targeted law enforcers and also set on fire police vehicles, including an APC, on Srinagar Highway, they added.
The police led by DIG Operation and CTD SSP used all available resources – teargas, rubber bullets and baton-charge – to disperse the protesters, but their successes were short-lived.
Due to the massive use of teargas and rubber bullets, the supplies were replenished several times. However, the PTI protesters gave a tough time to the law enforcers, causing injuries to over a dozen law enforcers. Meanwhile, at least five policemen sustained ‘firearm’ injuries, according to the police.
In Tarnol, a group of over 200 protesters uprooted a railway track as police made unsuccessful attempts to disperse them. A contingent of Rangers and the DIG Operations with a police squad left for Tarnol to counter the mob. At Chungi No 26, a mob roughed up a group of five policemen. An angry mob also attacked Ramna police station, tore down its main gate and set three motorcycles on fire, they added.

Violent scenes were witnessed at Rawat, T-Cross and Tramari Chowk, and over 2,000 policemen, 1,000 FC and Rangers were also deployed in different localities of the capital. The Red Zone was partially sealed as well.
In the afternoon, Faizabad was closed by the workers and supporters of the PTI. On the other hand, different areas of the city remained either sealed or no-go areas. The areas in the vicinity of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) office in G-6 and Red Zone also remained sealed.
Moreover, PTI claimed that unknown people continued their raids on PTI leaders’ homes to arrest the PTI leaders and workers without any warrants. “The Islamabad police carried out a number of raids on the houses of the PTI leaders without warrants in the federal capital. PTI Islamabad General Secretary and UC-37 Chairman Sajid Ali Qureshi’s house was raided by the police… raid on the office of UC 36 Chairman Raja Faisal [was also carried out],” a statement issued by PTI stated.
Rawalpindi
In Rawalpindi, police booked more than 1,500 PTI supporters and detained over 190 workers – 52 were sent to Adiala jail after they were produced in an anti-terrorism court. FIRs were registered at the R.A. Bazaar, Sadiqabad, New Town, City, Morgah and Race Course police stations on various criminal charges, including Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997. R.A. Bazaar police booked about 250 to 300 workers of the PTI, including former minister Raja Basharat, in connection with an attack on the General Headquarters (GHQ).

He said that the protesters were carrying batons and petrol bombs and were led by former provincial minister Raja Basharat and Khalid Jadoon. 
The protesters, incited by their leaders, stormed the gate even though they were stopped by the soldiers on duty but they offered resistance and blocked The Mall by setting old tyres on fire, the FIR added.
As per the FIR, enraged protesters damaged the GHQ building. They also hurled petrol bombs which caused a fire.
He said six protesters were captured, including the son of a retired colonel, while the remaining protesters escaped after causing damage to the army property.

Police said that five of the protesters were detained while the remaining others managed to escape. Police said that raids were underway to arrest all those identified in the FIRs and also those who could be identified in CCTV images.

3,Work on 10th Avenue halted due to lack of funds,Only 15pc work completed; CDA informed that Rs1.5 billion to be released at end of fiscal year,"ISLAMABAD: Construction work of 10th Avenue has been halted because of a funding issue as, it seems that this project is not a priority for the federal government. 
The project, which was started in March last year, was supposed to be completed by March 2024, however, so far, only around 15pc of the work has been completed in 14 months time. 
Nowadays, no construction work is being carried out, as sources said that the contractor, National Logistics Cell (NLC) has been facing a funding issue. 
“Yes, our 10th Avenue project is almost halted because of funding. We have been requesting the government for release of funds,” said an official of the engineering wing. 

Only 15pc work completed; CDA informed that Rs1.5 billion to be released at end of fiscal year

He said that the government has assured Capital Development Authority (CDA) that by the end of this fiscal year, Rs1.5 billion will be released for this project as special grant to ensure its continuation. 
The NLC, some months ago, had also issued a letter to CDA, asking whether the funds had been arranged. If not, it had stated, the company will disassociate itself from the project. 
The mega project worth Rs10.2 billion is a federal government project, which is being executed by CDA. Last year, the government had provided around Rs1.5 billion, but for the ongoing fiscal year, a meagre Rs350 million was earmarked in the budget. CDA officials said that the civic agency in the ongoing fiscal year had so far received only around Rs100 million. 
They said that in the upcoming budget, the government should earmark the entire amount to complete it in the next fiscal year. 
“So far, you can say work is halted. Now, it is almost impossible to complete this project in the deadline. However, in the next budget, if required funds are allocated, the project could be completed in one year’s time,” said an official of CDA. 
He said that without paying required funds to the construction company, the CDA could not force it for early completion. “Whenever we ask them to expedite the work, they demand required funds and assurance for smooth funding as well,” the officer said. 
The project has two phases; in the first phase (which was started last year and nowadays almost halted), a 5km road is being constructed from Katarian Bridge on I.J. Principal Road to Srinagar Highway near the intersection of G-9 and G-10. In the future, the second phase will be constructed from Srinagar Highway to Margalla Road. 
In addition to funding, the CDA could face another issue in this project, as a slum area – Rimsha Colony –near H-9 falls in the alignment of the said road. “This is the right time, when there is no serious progress in the project, that the CDA could resolve the issue of the slum. There is need for timely step to resolve this issue for ensuring smooth construction work when funds will be provided,” said an official. 
There are about 1,400 houses in the slum and CDA will have to shift their residents somewhere else. An official of the engineering wing said that CDA is cognisant of this issue and soon, this matter will be resolved.

ISLAMABAD: Internationally renowned Spanish cellist Aldo Mata used his instrumental talent to give an ovation-worthy performance on Tuesday night at the residence of the ambassador of Spain. 
He played the instrument passionately displaying precision and skill. There was never a dull moment in the hour long live concert. 
The Ambassador of Spain Jose A de Ory was delighted to introduce the cellist to his distinguished guests. “He is possibly the best cello player in Spain. Very proud of him to perform tonight,” the envoy said. 
The intimate and beautiful setting of the ambassador’s residence provided the perfect setting for the audience to discover Spain through all the senses as they met notable diplomats and local dignitaries at the gathering, while tasting Spanish delicacies. 
From the moment the concert began, Aldo Mata, held nothing back, as he brought in his performance intense drama when he performed his favourite JS Bach’s Gaspar Cassado Suite, a composition he has performed in four continents. “It feels so good every time I play this composition and I have been touring the world since I was 15 years old,” he said. 
“This set is like the bible of cello, the most important body of works for solo cello. So it was difficult to choose, which composition to play tonight,” the cellist said. 
Aldo Mata, who comes from a family of classical musicians, started playing cello when he was seven years old and from then on it was his favourite instrument. 
Beginning with a cello arrangement Aldo Mata proffered a dynamic fluctuation between delicate and impassioned phrasing in F, C, and D major that served the lush melodies, contrasts and emotional nature of the abstract pieces. 
“The pieces could be romantic or religious, anyway the audiences imagine. To others, they can imagine Spain and so on,” he added. His light, subtle strumming and picking were applied where it was most effective — on melodic peaks. 
There were nods and smiles in the audiences, who clearly enjoyed the performance and were not afraid to show their appreciation for the artist’s virtuosity. 
The lasting impression was one of warmth and admiration.

5,Minister asks special students to sharpen mental strength,"ISLAMABAD: Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal has advised the university ...","ISLAMABAD: Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal has advised the university students with special needs to sharpen their mental strength which he termed as the ‘key to success’.
He was addressing a ceremony held at HEC Secretariat on Wednesday in connection with distribution of electric wheelchairs among students under the last phase of the Prime Minister’s Electric Wheelchair for University Students, says a press release issued by the Planning Commission.
It said as many as 50 students received electric wheelchairs during the ceremony. 
In the first phase of the scheme, launched in 2017, 206 electric wheelchairs were provided to physically challenged university students, while 159 wheelchairs were handed over to students in the second phase.
Giving example of the famous scientist, Stephen Hawking, the minister said that an otherwise healthy person with no use of mental capabilities is worthless, while a physically challenged person who utilises their mind can mark great achievements.
“The future of Pakistan depends on making right decisions on time, as any wrong decision can put the country’s future at stake,” said the minister while urging the students to play their constructive role for the country’s growth. 
Later, the Minister launched HEC’s Research for Innovation (RFI) portal.
In his remarks, HEC Chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmed appreciated Ahsan Iqbal for conceiving the idea of facilitating the challenged university students through provision of electric wheelchairs in 2016-17 and taking practical measures for its execution.

Hundreds of policemen and paramilitary forces were deployed there while vehicles and pedestrians were not allowed to pass through the vicinity. 
Barbed wires and cemented blocks have been placed at all entry and exit points to the area.
“It is not understandable why the whole area has been closed. Security forces should have been deployed only around the NAB office,” a resident said.
Over and above, Lal Masjid has also been cordoned off and even people living in nearby localities are turned back and not allowed to cross the blockade and barbed wires.

The decision of increasing the tax on cigarettes will result in curbing smoking.
Dr Hassan Shehzad said this while talking to students of the Islamic International University of Islamabad.
He said in Pakistan, around 337,500 people die due to smoking each year while causing a burden of around Rs620 billion on the health sector. The government jacked up the Federal Excise Duty (FED) on cigarettes in February to discourage its use and boost its revenues, but the multinational tobacco companies have been lobbying to reverse it.
He said in Pakistan, multinational cigarette companies continue to spread propaganda by stating that increase in cigarette prices results in illegal cigarettes becoming available in the market. 
The number of deaths from smoking was falling in rich countries but rising in low-to-middle income countries like Pakistan, he said.
He said around 1,200 children were taking up smoking in Pakistan daily which was pushing the share of smokers up unlike developed and many other developing countries.

8,Pakistan’s democracy under threat from militant non-state actors: ex-senator,ISLAMABAD: Former PPP senator Farhatullah Babar on Wednesday said no other constitutional democracy in the world was...,"ISLAMABAD: Former PPP senator Farhatullah Babar on Wednesday said no other constitutional democracy in the world was as threatened by militant non-state actors as Pakistan and losing the war would bring the constitutional democracy to an end.
“If while fighting we continue to yield to the temptation to give more and more powers to law enforcing agencies it means erosion of constitutionalism and rule of law,” said PPP Senator Farhatullah Babar on Wednesday while speaking at the international constitutional convention in the Parliament house.
He said the situation became far more complex and difficult for a parliament amid perceptions that some elements in the state may actually be supporting some non-state actors.
He said deep rooted polarization was yet another threat to constitutional democracy in Pakistan. When the sacred state institutions, media houses, political parties, trade unions and civil society were deeply divided, alarm bells must ring for constitutional democracy. Never before state institutions in Islamabad or Rawalpindi seem so polarised and divided as today, he said.
Meanwhile, speakers at the Breakout Session of the two-day international constitutional convention aiming to commemorate the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of the Constitution of Pakistan said the democracy could not function without devolution of powers at the grassroots level.
Chairing the session on ‘Federalism and Devolution of Powers: Challenges and Opportunities’, Pakistan Peoples Party’s Dr Nafisa Shah explained that federalism, a state-building governance, was a fascinating model offering wide-ranging solutions to addressing diversities and differences in a political system.
She quoted the Magistrate of History Lord Acton as saying that “Federalism is the best curb on democracy. It assigns limited powers to the central government. Thereby all power is limited. It excludes absolute power of the majority.”
Nafisa Shah ironically said: “The frequent military rule in Pakistan helped strengthen the federal system in the country. Every time, the military rule suspends the Constitution and sub-national movements got concurrency for further reinforcing the demand for a federal constitution to protect the rights of smaller provinces.”
Meanwhile, Senator Anwarul Haq Kakar said the federating units were a symbol of ethnicity, adding that although they had been empowered but there was an emergent need to devolve the powers to the local bodies.
