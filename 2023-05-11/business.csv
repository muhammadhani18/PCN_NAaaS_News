0,Remittances tumble by 29pc in April,Pakistan lost $3.4bn in 10 months due to exchange rate issues.,"KARACHI: Remittances being sent by overseas Pakistanis fell by 29.2 per cent in April compared to April 2022 while it declined by 13pc during the first 10 months of the current fiscal year.
The State Bank of Pakistan reported on Wednesday that Pakistan received $2.21 billion in April against $3.124bn in the same month last year showing a decline of 29.2pc while dipped by 12.8pc when compared with $2.536bn sent in March.
The decline in April disappointed market experts who were expecting improved remittances due to Ramazan-related higher inflows. 
During the holy month, 15 to 20pc higher remittances are normal for the country but it was shocking particularly when Pakistan needs dollars to avert a default-like situation.

Pakistan lost $3.4bn in 10 months due to exchange rate issues

The remittances declined by $3.4bn or 13pc to $22.741bn during July-April FY23 compared to $26.143bn in the same period last year.
The loss of $3.4bn is much higher than the amount Pakistan has been begging from IMF for the last eight months despite fulfilling all preconditions the $1.1bn tranche has yet not been released. 
After the arrest of Imran Khan, the political crisis has deepened which could further delay the IMF loan. Researchers and financial sector experts believe that the IMF and friendly countries have been asking the PDM government to bring political stability crucial to restore the confidence of the international community to help it steer the economy back on the right path. 
The persistent instability has badly hit the trading and industrial activities across the country as a result the economy is forecast to hardly grow by less than half a per cent during the current fiscal year.
The details showed that Pakistan received the highest amount of $5.4bn from Saudi Arabia in July-April 2022-23 against $6.53bn in the same period last year, recording a decline of $1.1bn or 17.3pc.
The second highest amount of $3.987bn was received from the UAE which also dipped by 18.8pc or $925m. Inflows from the United Kingdom fell by 7.2pc to $3.411bn.
The only meagre increase of 0.2pc in the remittances was from the US to $2.5bn during the 10 months.
The inflows from GCC countries fell by 12pc to $2.666bn compared to $3.029bn last year. The inflows from the European Union also declined by 7.7pc to $2.59bn during 10MFY23.
Currency dealers said that the country lost $3.4bn in remittances only because of the increasing business of hawala system (grey market). Since the importers are unable to open letters of credit for raw materials, they have to buy dollars from the grey market despite very high rates. The grey market rate was Rs310 per dollar on Tuesday which sharply increased to Rs320 on Wednesday due to a sudden increase in the dollar rates in Pakistan.
“The overseas Pakistanis are getting Rs27 to Rs28 per dollar higher through the hundi system. It yields much higher money compared to banking market or exchange companies,” said a currency dealer.

1,"Gold price hits record Rs240,000","“Some investors are buying gold due to massive rupee depreciation and deepening political noise,” says CEO Topline Securities.","KARACHI: Despite no significant change in the international market, gold prices in Pakistan witnessed the highest-ever single-day hike of Rs9,900 and Rs8,487 in one-tola and 10-gram rates, respectively, on Wednesday.
All Sindh Saraf Jewellers Association announced that the one-tola and 10-gram of gold hit an all-time high of Rs240,000 and Rs205,761, while the yellow metal rate remained unchanged at $2,031 per ounce on the world markets.
Since the beginning of the current year, consumers have witnessed a meteoric rise in rates for one-tola and 10-gram, increasing by Rs52,800 and Rs45,267, respectively, while the world gold price has swelled by $207 per ounce. 
On Jan 1, the rates for one-tola, 10-gram, and the international market were Rs187,200, Rs160,494, and $1,824 per ounce, respectively.
On Wednesday, the Pakistani rupee hit a record low against the dollar in the interbank market, closing at Rs290.22, down by 1.85pc or Rs5.38 from Tuesday. Domestic gold prices are determined by daily fluctuations in the international price and the rupee-dollar exchange rate.
Mohammad Arshad, Chairman of the All Pakistan Jewellers Manufacturers Association (APJMA), said: “Both the satta mafia and investors have become active in purchasing 10-tola gold bars due to market panic surrounding the future political and economic situations following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday. Investors are even booking gold bars at this peak rate.”
On the contrary, he claimed that jewellery sales have remained at only 10pc amid an ongoing marriage season after Eidul Fitr.
“Many people are unable to afford the yellow metal at record high rates and this is one of the main reasons for lacklustre jewellery buying,” he added.
“Gold rates are fast entering into the luxury category, which include precious stones like diamonds, emerald and gems. It will be a challenging task for the middle- and upper-middle-class to afford gold jewellery in the future,” he said.
Mohammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities, said: “Some investors are buying gold due to massive rupee depreciation and deepening political noise.”
Fahad Rauf, Head of Research at Ismail Iqbal Securities, said:  “Investors rush towards gold amid growing political and financial uncertainty as it is considered a safe haven.”

2,PIA gets nod for Roosevelt Hotel rental deal,ECC also approves Rs153m for legal expenses in water dispute with India.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday allowed the Pakistan International Airlines-Investment Ltd (PIA-IL) to sign an agreement with the New York City Government (NYCG) for the utilisation of Roosevelt Hotel on rental for three years after reaching a settlement deal with the hotel union.
The decision was taken at a special meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet that also allowed two supplementary grants worth Rs153 million as legal expenses in a water dispute with India and Rs4 billion local currency cover to secure disbursement of equivalent loan from the World Bank. Finance Minister Ishaq Dar presided over the meeting.
Based on a briefing and summary of the Ministry of Aviation on challenges and re-opening of Roosevelt Hotel, New York, the ECC “approved the execution of settlement agreement with the hotel union and the New York City Government”, said an announcement, adding that it further gave nod for withdrawal of pending lawsuits by the Roosevelt Hotel with the hotel union and the City of New York pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement with the union.
The ECC also directed the PIAL, on the request of the Aviation Ministry, to engage and share its business plan with the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) regarding the rollover of a $142m loan for another two years i.e. until Dec 31, 2024. 

ECC also approves Rs153m for legal expense in water dispute with India

The meeting was informed that a four-member negotiating committee constituted by the ECC on April 28 led by the Secretary Aviation Division had a final round of negotiations with the NYCG and the staff union of Roosevelt Hotel Co (RHC) for utilisation of the 1,025 hotel rooms for a period of three years for Immigrant Housing Business by the NYCG. 
The resultant agreements (with NYCG and the staff union) have already been cleared by the PIA-IL board of directors on May 8. The board had sought ECC’s concurrence before signing a settlement agreement with the union and the NYCG. Over three years, the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel would thus get about $19m in net cash flows against its 1,025 rooms instead of incurring over $160m carrying costs for the same period.
The offer envisaged a 14-month guaranteed period along with a 4-month termination notice period (minimum of 18 months). The contract is to commence on May 15 and entails per night rent for each room at $200 for the first year, $205 for the second year and $210 for the third year. The New York City government will cover the taxes etc and make a payment of $1.74m monthly rent on the first of each month in advance.
Water dispute with India
The ECC also approved Rs153m additional funds to the Ministry of Water Resources for payment of legal costs and fees relating to a dispute with India in the Court of Arbitration (COA) and Neutral Expert (NE) for violating the Indus Waters Treaty while developing 330MW Kishenganga and 850MW Ratle Hydropower projects on Jhelum and Chenab rivers respectively.
The first hearings of the COA and NE were held on Jan 27-28 and Feb 27-28, respectively at the Peace Palance in The Hague, the Netherlands. While the Minister of Water Resources already had budgetary allocations of Rs821m, another Rs153m additional amount was needed for payment to Pakistan’s external legal team. 
Pakistan has disputed the two projects for violation of treaty fundamentals relating to bondage, intake, sediment outlets, spillways and freeboard.
The ECC also approved a Rs4bn additional grant as rupee cover (Equivalent to US$ 20 million) to the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training for the World Bank Programme “Actions to Strengthen Performance for Inclusive and Responsive Education” to avoid cancellation of loan by the bank.

4,"Pakistan, Iran to revive gas pipeline project",Iranian official proposes initiation of direct flights between Iran and Pakistan to enhance travel and business opportunities.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Iran on Wednesday agreed to explore new avenues of collaboration in the fields of aviation including direct flight, revival of gas pipeline project and expansion of trade between the two nations.
The understanding was reached during a meeting between Commerce Minister Naveed Qamar and visiting Chairman of the Commission of National Security and Foreign Policy of the Majlis of the Islamic Republic of Iran Vahid Jalalzadeh, who is leading a high-level delegation to Pakistan to discuss various measures to promote bilateral economic relations between the two countries.
An official announcement issued after the meeting said that both sides underlined the need to strengthen economic ties and emphasised the importance of increased connectivity.
Mr Jalalzadeh proposed the initiation of direct flights between Iran and Pakistan to enhance travel and business opportunities. 
Mr Qamar acknowledged the significance of this proposal and expressed his support for establishing direct flights as a means to facilitate trade and promote people-to-people exchanges.
During the meeting, the discussions also touched upon the long-standing issue of the Pak-Iran Gas pipeline. Mr Qamar stressed the importance of expediting the project, as it holds immense potential for energy cooperation between the two countries.
He pledged his commitment to resolve any obstacles and move forward with the pipeline, which would bring substantial benefits to both nations.
Recognising the current trade volume of approximately $2 billion as insufficient, Mr Jalalzadeh urged the need to take solid steps to increase it to a multi-billion-dollar level. However, there is no official trade between the two countries owing to the non-availability of banking channels and restrictions.
Mr Qamar emphasised the importance of opening new border markets and implementing a barter trade system to facilitate greater commercial exchange. These measures, he believed, would significantly boost trade volume.
Mr Jalalzadeh also invited Mr Qamar to visit Iran.
The inauguration of one of the six crossings at the Pasheen Border on May 18 by the prime minister of Pakistan and the president of Iran also came under discussion.
