4,"No intention to wind up free treatment scheme, govt informs PHC",Court disposes of plea against suspension of programme,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Wednesday disposed of a petition challenging the suspension of free health facilities under the Sehat Sahulat Card by the relevant insurance company, as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa advocate general assured it that the government had no intention to close down the scheme.
A bench consisting of PHC Chief Justice Musarrat Hilali and Justice Shakeel Ahmad took up for preliminary hearing the petition filed by former MPA of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Fazal Ilahi, who claimed that the government suspended the free treatment programme, causing hardships to people.
Advocate General Aamir Javed stated that due to financial constraints, provision of certain facilities under the said programme had to be suspended. However, he said that recently provincial government released an amount of Rs2 billion to State Life Insurance Corporation (SLIC) after which the services were restored.
He said that the provincial government had no intention to abolish the programme and the petition was not based on facts. He contended that as the grievance of the petitioner had already been addressed, therefore, the petition had become infructuous.

Court disposes of plea against suspension of programme

Petitioner’s counsel Shah Faisal Ilyas said that the PTI had served Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province for almost nine years and during that period it had spent billions of rupees on provision of free health facilities to the people.
He stated that the provincial assembly was dissolved in January after which the caretaker government was installed. He said that provincial government after assuming power started adopting anti-people policies and also stopped the Sehat Sahulat Card (SSC) programme without assigning any cogent reason.
He claimed that last month, the SLIC asked the empanelled hospitals to stop admitting new patients under the said programme till further orders. He contended that the act of the respondents including the provincial government and SLIC of suspending the programme amounted to committing crime against the society, especially its poor segments.
The counsel contended that the impugned order of the respondents was taken in violation of several of the constitutional provisions and was thus unconstitutional and illegal.
He argued that free medical treatment of people under the Sehat Sahulat Card programme had been given protection by the previous government through an Act of assembly and thus it could not be stopped.
He said that Section 230 of Elections Act prohibited the caretaker government from making any policy decision in the province and thus its decision was illegal and without lawful authority.
He said that Supreme Court of Pakistan had also ruled in one of its judgments that the powers of the caretaker government should be implemented in line with the spirit of Part VIII of Constitution and Section 230 of Elections Act, 2017.

5,PHC adjourns hearing in PTI’s plea against delay in KP polls,"Comments filed on behalf of governor, bench informed.","PESHAWAR: Owing to absence of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governor’s counsel, Peshawar High Court on Wednesday adjourned hearing into a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s petition seeking orders for Election Commission of Pakistan to hold polls for provincial assembly within 90 days of its dissolution or with minimum possible deviation from that deadline.
A bench consisting of PHC Chief Justice Musarrat Hilali and Justice Shakeel Ahmad observed that it would fix next date of hearing later on.
The bench put off the hearing after an assistant of Tariq Afridi, lawyer for the provincial governor, informed it that comments were filed on behalf of governor. He stated that Mr Afridi had gone to Islamabad and could not return due to uncertain situation and closure of roads.
During course of hearing, the PHC chief justice expressed concerns over the political situation in the country, observing that their forefathers rendered sacrifices for the country and the ongoing situation was a matter of sorrow for them.

Comments filed on behalf of governor, bench informed

The petition is jointly filed by KP Assembly Speaker Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani and PTI secretary general Asad Umar.
The petitioners requested the court to declare illegal and unconstitutional a letter written by the governor to ECP in March to recommend Oct 8 as the election date and a subsequent notification by the commission to fix that date for polls.
The KP Assembly was dissolved by the governor on January 18 on the advice of the then chief minister.
Advocate Shumail Ahmad Butt appeared for the petitioners and stated that the present petition was filed in the light of the April 4 order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, wherein the apex court ordered that the petitioners should seek relief from the appropriate forum. He said that the 90-day election deadline stipulated by the Constitution expired on April 18.
He stated that ECP issued the impugned notification on March 27, fixing Oct 8 as the polling day. He contended that Supreme Court in its order fixed May 14 as date for holding polls for the provincial assembly of Punjab, but it did not give any such date for the KP polls.
The counsel said that the apex court had ordered that the issue of polls in KP should be taken up before the appropriate forum. 
He added that a petition was filed in that regard before the Supreme Court but it was returned by the registrar after which the present petition was filed in the high court.
He requested the court to declare that elections for the provincial assembly should be held not later than 90 days of its dissolution, subject to the barest minimum deviation in present circumstances.
Mt Butt said that the provincial caretaker government completed its three-month tenure and the affairs of the government were run by unelected persons, which was an injustice to the people of the province. He contended that the respondents were using delaying tactics and were not filing comments to the petition.
Advocate General Aamir Javed said that the provincial government had already filed its comments in the case. ECP’s counsel Mohsin Kamran Siddique informed the bench that the reply of the commission was also filed in the case.
The bench observed that it would decide the matter in accordance with Constitution.
Mr Butt requested the court that the next date might be fixed at the earliest as the issue was already delayed due to one reason or another.

Addressing mediapersons at the Peshawar Press Club, e said that it was not acceptable for political parties and their workers to damage national property. He said that peaceful protest was a right of everyone within the scope of Constitution and law, but what was happening in the country, especially in Peshawar, for the last two days was evidence of the fact that a particular political party was fanning terrorism in the country and trying to weaken the country.
The governor said that what anti-state elements could not do with the country, PTI leader Imran Khan and his party were doing all that by using the youth against the state institutions for their ulterior motives and political gains.
“What message does Imran Khan want to give to the world and anti-state elements by instigating the youth to attack the public properties and state institutions,” he questioned.
He recalled that political leaders of the country endured hardships of imprisonment and faced charges and cases against them. He said that during Imran Khan’s tenure, scores of MNAs including former president Asif Ali Zardari, former prime ministers and former minister were locked up but no political party attacked the lives and properties of people as did the PTI protesters.
The governor said that PTI workers should register their peaceful protest as per Constitution instead of resorting to violence, burning national properties and attacking people.
“The country is currently facing numerous challenges such as inflation, unemployment, economic crisis and law and order while violent demonstrations by PTI workers are further aggravating the situation,” he said.
He advised PTI leader Imran Khan and other party leaders to face the cases in courts and prove their innocence instead of instigating people for violent protests.
The governor said that political leadership of the country went to jails for five, 10 and 30 years but never encouraged their workers to harm national properties, institutions and lives and property of people.
He urged youth to see as to who was plotting to weaken the country by provoking people, using inappropriate language against the state institutions, security forces, police and judiciary.
He also asked PTI to identify the black sheep in the party and part ways with them and play role in the country’s development and prosperity.
