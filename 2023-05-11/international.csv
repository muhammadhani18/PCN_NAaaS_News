0,Tabloid apologises to Harry at start of phone-hacking trial,LONDON: The publisher of a British tabloid has apologised to Prince Harry for unlawfully seeking information about...,"LONDON: The publisher of a British tabloid has apologised to Prince Harry for unlawfully seeking information about him at the start of a lawsuit the royal is bringing over alleged phone-hacking in which he is due to give evidence himself.
Harry, 38, and some 100 celebrities including actors, sports stars, singers and TV personalities, are suing publisher Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), accusing its titles of habitually accessing private information by widespread phone-hacking, deception and other illicit means between 1991 and 2011.
The claimants say the unlawful behaviour at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People had occurred with the full knowledge of senior editors and top executives who they say knew about it, approved it and actively covered it up.
The titles are owned by Reach.
MGN is contesting the allegations, arguing some claims have been brought too late, and rejecting most others such as saying there was no evidence Harry was a victim of hacking. It denies any senior figures had knowledge of unlawful acts.
However, in documents to the High Court in London, MGN did admit on one occasion a private investigator had been engaged to unlawfully gather evidence about him at a London nightclub in 2004, saying it “unreservedly apologises and accepts that (Harry) is entitled to appropriate compensation”.
Harry, who was not present for the start of the hearing, has been selected as one of four test cases for the seven-week trial and is due to give evidence himself in person in early June, the first British royal to do so since the 19th century, according to local media.
“Prince or not, the blatantly unlawful and illegal methods that were used by the defendant to get every piece of information about his life away from royal duties was quite frankly appalling,” David Sherborne, the lawyer representing Harry and the other claimants, told the court on Wednesday.
“No one should have been subjected to that.” He said the unlawful actions had taken place on an “industrial scale”, saying MGN had spent millions on private investigators.
Coronation
The trial begins just days after his father’s coronation on Saturday where Harry appeared only briefly for the ceremony at London’s Westminster Abbey and played no formal role. He is believed to have returned immediately to California where his son Prince Archie was celebrating his fourth birthday.
The Mirror case is just one of four that Harry is currently pursuing against newspapers, saying it was his duty to expose “criminality” committed by the tabloids on behalf of those without the same resources as he has.
In March, he attended court in person to hear lawyers for Associated, which publishes the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, seek to throw out a case brought by him and other high-profile figures including singer Elton John.
He is also pursuing a phone-hacking case against Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers (NGN) and is also suing Associated for libel, with a decision on whether he can win that case without a trial also expected presently. All the publishers have promised to rigorously fight the claims.

1,"‘Deeply concerned’ about Myanmar violence, say Asean leaders",Jakarta raises hope the bloc could push for peaceful solution this year.,"LABUAN BAJO (Indonesia): Southeast Asian nations said on Wednesday they are “deeply concerned” about the violence ravaging Myanmar, and condemned a recent attack on a convoy of diplomats delivering humanitarian aid in the country.
Turmoil in junta-ruled Myanmar has dominated talks at this week’s Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Indonesia, as the regional bloc faces criticism for its perceived inaction.
Asean has led diplomatic attempts to resolve the festering crisis, but its efforts so far have failed to stem the bloodshed unleashed by a military coup in 2021.
“We were deeply concerned with ongoing violence in Myanmar and urged the immediate cessation of all forms of violence and the use of force to create a conducive environment for the safe and timely delivery of humanitarian assistance and inclusive national dialogues,” Asean leaders said in a statement.

Jakarta raises hope the bloc could push for peaceful solution this year

The junta has ignored international criticism and refused to engage with its opponents, which include ousted lawmakers, anti-coup “People’s Defence Forces” and armed ethnic minority groups.
“We condemned the attack and underlined that the perpetrators must be held accountable,” Asean leaders said in their statement.
Addressing the summit on Wednesday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said he was “confident” the 10-member bloc could deal with growing global challenges if its members were united.
“With unity, Asean will be able to play a central role in bringing peace and growth,” Widodo said through a translator as he opened the leaders’ session of the summit.
Foreign ministers and national leaders meeting on the Indonesian island of Flores are trying to kick-start a five-point plan agreed upon with Myanmar two years ago after mediation attempts to end the violence failed.
Myanmar remains an Asean member but has been barred from top-level summits due to the junta’s failure to implement the peace plan.
Jakarta’s chairmanship of the bloc this year had raised hopes Asean could push for a peaceful solution, using its economic weight as well as its diplomatic experience.
Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said on Friday that her country was using “quiet diplomacy” to speak with all sides of the Myanmar conflict and spur renewed peace efforts.
But a senior Indonesian minister said on Tuesday that Asean was at a “crossroad” and risked becoming irrelevant if it failed to deal with Myanmar and other regional emergencies.
Indonesia was running out of time to achieve a breakthrough, said Lina Alexandra, an analyst at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta.
After the next leaders’ summit in September, Alexandra added, Indonesia will hand the bloc’s influential chairmanship to communist-ruled Laos, which could bring Myanmar back “into the fold” and allow the junta to attend Asean summits.

2,Kremlin terms Kaliningrad renaming ‘hostile act’,MOSCOW: The Kremlin said on Wednesday that Poland’s decision to rename the Russian city of Kaliningrad in its...,"MOSCOW: The Kremlin said on Wednesday that Poland’s decision to rename the Russian city of Kaliningrad in its official documents was a “hostile act”, as bilateral ties continue to fray over the war in Ukraine.
Kaliningrad was known by the German name of Koenigsberg until after World War II, when it was annexed by the Soviet Union and renamed to honour Soviet politician Mikhail Kalinin.
Warsaw said on Tuesday that Kalinin’s connection to the 1940 Katyn massacre — when thousands of Polish military officers were executed by Soviet forces — had negative connotations and that the city should now be referred to as Krolewiec, its name when it was ruled by the Kingdom of Poland in the 15th and 16th centuries.
“The current Russian name of this city is an artificial baptism unrelated to either the city or the region,” Poland’s committee on geographical standardisation said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the decision “bordered on madness”.
“We know that throughout history Poland has slipped from time to time into this madness of hatred towards Russians,” he told a daily news briefing.
Relations between Poland and Russia have historically often been very strained, including during and after World War Two.
Sentenced to jail
Two Russian soldiers from Kamchatka in the far east have been sentenced to two and a half years each in prison for refusing to fight in Ukraine, human rights group OVD-Info said.
In separate rulings, the men, identified in military court documents as Alexander Stepanov and Andrei Mikhailov, were found guilty of refusing orders to go into combat during wartime. Russian President Vladimir Putin amended the criminal code last year to include prison sentences of up to three years for such violations.

3,Italy arrests 29 for smuggling migrants,ROME: Italian police on Wednesday arrested 29 people on charges of belonging to a criminal group smuggling migrants...,"ROME: Italian police on Wednesday arrested 29 people on charges of belonging to a criminal group smuggling migrants by boat from Turkiye and Greece, a statement said.
Italy is struggling with a sharp rise in arrivals of sea migrants, with over 45,000 coming ashore so far in 2023 against about 12,000 in the same period last year, with numbers growing especially from north Africa.
Boats are also increasingly reaching Italy’s coasts via the eastern Mediterranean route. In February, dozens of people who had left Turkiye died in a shipwreck off the southern region of Calabria.
Police said the 29 people arrested were part of a network active also in Greece and Turkiye. The 29 were not only smuggling migrants to Italy but also helping them to reach central and northern European countries, police said. Police said migrants — mostly from Asia and the Middle East — were asked between 7,000 and 15,000 euros ($7,705 - $16,512) for the trip and smugglers made large use of sailing boats, looking to escape police checks at sea.
The boat captains were mainly Ukrainians or people from “the former Soviet Union area,” the statement said, while other parts of the criminal group mostly came from the Middle East.

4,Climate maths ‘doesn’t add up’ without carbon capture: COP28 chief,"“Renewable energies are not and cannot be the only answer,” argues Al Jaber, the head of oil giant ADNOC aS well as the country’s climate envoy.","ABU DHABI: The Emirati oil chief leading this year’s UN climate talks said on Wednesday the world must get “serious” about new emission-capturing technology, rather than focussing only on replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy.
Sultan Al Jaber said renewables such as solar and wind “cannot be the only answer”, especially in the steel, cement and aluminium industries, where emissions are particularly hard to reduce.
While major oil producers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are touting carbon capture and storage as a remedy for global warming, some experts caution that the nascent technology is unproven and expensive, and should not replace efforts to phase out hydrocarbons.
“Renewable energies are not and cannot be the only answer,” argued Al Jaber, who is simultaneously the head of state oil giant ADNOC and the country’s climate envoy.
“If we are serious about curbing industrial emissions, we need to get serious about carbon capture technologies,” he told the United Arab Emirates’ Climate Tech event in Abu Dhabi.
“In any realistic scenario that gets us to net zero... carbon capture technology will have a role to play. Without it, the math just doesn’t add up.
“We need to phase out emissions,” added Al Jaber, reiterating his position that crude remains indispensable to the global economy and crucial to financing the energy transition.
COP battleground issue
The debate between carbon capture and reduced fossil fuel use is shaping as a key battleground at COP28, beginning in November in Dubai, the UAE’s commercial hub.
Earlier this year, the UN’s climate expert panel (IPCC) said the world risks crossing the key 1.5-degree Celsius global warming threshold in about a decade, urging a drastic reduction in planet-heating emissions.
One of the fastest transformations will need to be in energy, the report said, with solar and wind power already expanding dramatically.
Major economies are taking key steps, with the European Union banning sales of new fossil fuel cars from 2035 and planning to nearly double renewable energy production by 2030.
But greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure will still push the world beyond 1.5C unless the costly and emerging carbon capture and storage technologies are utilised, the IPCC said.
“Cost remains a barrier,” said Al Jaber, president-designate of COP28.
He said policymakers must provide incentives to companies to commercialise technological solutions, including carbon capture and storage (CCS) and direct air capture (DAC).
CCS syphons off CO2 pollution from energy production and heavy industry and stores it underground, thus preventing it from entering the atmosphere.
By contrast, direct air capture — still in its infancy — removes CO2 directly from ambient air, which makes it a “negative emissions” technology.
‘Distraction we can’t afford’
Some environmentalists are sceptical about the focus on carbon capture, with Rex Weyler from Greenpeace last year labelling it a “scam”.

5,Syrian stand-up comedy has war-weary crowds in stitches,"DAMASCUS: In a dimly lit Damascus cafe, Sharief Homsi kicked off comedy night with a quip about war-battered...","DAMASCUS: In a dimly lit Damascus cafe, Sharief Homsi kicked off comedy night with a quip about war-battered Syria’s modern-day prince charming: an eligible bachelor with attractive supplies of fuel and electricity.
“Marry me, I have a bright future: 100 litres of petrol, solar panels to generate electricity and three gas canisters,” he said, performing a mock proposal that had the audience howling.
Every week, members of Syria’s first stand-up comedy troupe crack jokes about daily struggles like power cuts and fuel shortages, lightening the mood for despondent Damascenes after 12 years of war.
The audience prefers  “to laugh and forget the problems they cannot solve”, said Homsi, 31. “There is nothing else to do but laugh.” He and a few of his friends founded  “Styria” — an Arabic mash-up of Syria and hysteria — four months ago, and put out a call on social media for others to join. The group has since swelled to 35 members and has become a success, regularly drawing crowds at the capital’s Deez cafe. “The country’s situation is hysterical,” Homsi said, and  “filled with problems and gloom”. “We must face it with hysterical laughter.” The war in Syria, which broke out in 2011, has killed more than 500,000 people, displaced millions and battered the country’s infrastructure and industry.
In government-held Damascus, religion and politics are off-limits for the comedians, deemed too risky to broach. Before performances, they meet at a troupe member’s home to brainstorm and try out new lines.

6,Iran hangs seven more in execution ‘spree’,IHR says the latest hangings mean Iran has seen at least 64 executions in the last 12 days alone.,"PARIS: Iran executed seven men in two prisons outside Tehran on drugs and rape charges on Wednesday, a rights group said, accelerating what activists describe as a hanging spree over the past two weeks.
Three men were executed on drug-related charges in Ghezal Hesar prison in the city of Karaj outside Tehran, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) NGO said.
 






It added that four other men were hanged on rape charges in Rajai Shahr prison, also in Karaj.
The judiciary’s Mizan Online website confirmed the three executions on drug charges, saying the convicts were members of a cocaine distribution cartel.
There has been no official confirmation so far of the four executions on rape charges.
IHR said the latest hangings mean Iran has seen at least 64 executions in the last 12 days alone.
“The killing machine of the government is accelerating — its goal is to intimidate the people and its victims are the weakest people in society,” said IHR director Mahmood Amiry Moghaddam.
IHR posted footage which it said showed families of the three men executed on drug charges protesting outside Ghezel Hesar prison in a last-ditch bid to stop the hangings.
Gunfire was audible in the video and it said police used tear gas and batons to disperse the protest. One family member was hospitalised with severe injuries after being beaten, it added.
Campaigners accuse Iran of using the death penalty as a means to intimidate the public following weeks of protests that erupted in September last year following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini after she was arrested for allegedly violating Iran’s dress rules for women.

7,Tunisian policeman kills five outside synagogue,DJERBA: Tunisia’s small Jewish community was in shock and mourning on Wednesday after a bloody shooting rampage in...,"DJERBA: Tunisia’s small Jewish community was in shock and mourning on Wednesday after a bloody shooting rampage in which a police officer killed five people outside Africa’s oldest synagogue.
The shooting on Tuesday sparked mass panic during an annual Jewish pilgrimage at the historic Ghriba synagogue on the resort island of Djerba, which was quickly locked down by security forces.
“I never believed that I would experience such terror,” recounted one survivor, Raoudha Seibi.
The attack was “a real nightmare”, said a tearful Seibi, a member of the Tunisian Association for the Support of Minorities. “I am still in shock.” Authorities were investigating the motive of the killer, who was shot dead after killing three police officers and two visitors, a French-Tunisian and an Israeli-Tunisian man.
French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to keep up the fight “against anti-Semitic hatred”, and Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said the bloodshed proves “evil and hatred are still there”.
The Ghriba pilgrimage was previously targeted in a 2002 suicide truck bombing that killed 21 people.
The gunman, wearing his police uniform and a bulletproof vest, started the attack by killing a fellow officer and taking his gun and ammunition at the island’s port, said officials. He then went to the Ghriba synagogue site and opened fire outside, sparking terror on the final day of the annual pilgrimage.
The two victims were named as Tunisian-Israeli dual national Aviel Haddad, 30, and his cousin, Benjamin Haddad, 42, who held both Tunisian and French nationalities.
In the ensuing gun battle, he also wounded six police officers, two of whom later died, hospital sources said.
“Around 8pm [local time] we heard the sound of gunfire,” recounted another eyewitness, an elderly Israeli man who gave his name as Elyahu. “The police closed all the doors and we couldn’t get out. We couldn’t do anything for more than three hours. “Some were praying, some were crying.” 
Investigations are continuing on the motive behind the “cowardly attack”, the interior ministry said, refraining from referring to the shooting as a terrorist attack.
The shooting was Tunisia’s first deadly attack on foreigners since 2015, when Islamist gunmen in Tunis and Sousse killed dozens of foreign holidaymakers.
More than 5,000 Jewish faithful, mostly from overseas, participated in this year’s event, said organisers. The annual pilgrimage only resumed in 2022 after two years of pandemic-related suspension.
The United States “deplores the attack in Tunisia coinciding with the annual Jewish pilgrimage that draws faithful to the El Ghriba Synagogue from around the world,” said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.
“We express condolences to the Tunisian people and commend the rapid action of Tunisian security forces.” Coming between Passover and Shavuot, the pilgrimage to Ghriba is at the heart of Jewish tradition in Tunisia, where only about 1,500 members of the faith still live — mainly on Djerba — compared with around 100,000 before independence in 1956.

8,Race row over Cleopatra documentary,Archaeologist Zahi Hawass’s documentary “Cleopatra” describes itself as telling the “true” story of the Ptolemaic dynasty’s last ruler.,"CAIRO: An Egyptian archaeologist on Wednesday released a documentary on the life of Cleopatra, the same day Netflix began streaming a controversial production depicting the ancient queen as black.
For weeks, pundits and officials in Egypt have reacted angrily to streaming platform Netflix’s decision to cast British actress Adele James in the lead role of its production “Queen Cleopatra” — insisting the ruler had lighter skin.
Archaeologist Zahi Hawass’s 90-minute documentary “Cleopatra”, released on director Curtis Ryan Woodside’s YouTube channel, describes itself as telling the “true” story of the Ptolemaic dynasty’s last ruler.
 


“Was Cleopatra black? First of all, I have nothing against black people at all, but I am stating the facts — look at the Macedonian queens, none of them were black”, Hawass, a former antiquities minister, says in the documentary.
In April, Egypt’s antiquities ministry weighed in on the debate, insisting the historical Cleopatra had “white skin and Hellenistic characteristics”.
Netflix promoted its documentary-drama “Queen Cleopatra”, produced by Jada Pinkett Smith, as featuring “re-enactments and expert interviews”.
Cleopatra was the last sovereign of the Ptolemaic dynasty, which was of Greek origin and ruled Egypt between 332 and 30 BC.
While legend holds the queen, born around 69 BC, was a great beauty, her appearance and the colour of her skin are largely open to interpretation.
 






Following the release of a trailer for the Netflix production, an online petition accusing the streaming service of rewriting history had garnered more than 40,000 signatures by late April.
In a country where some were already calling for Netflix to be banned for content deemed offensive to Egypt or “its family values”, legislator Saboura al-Sayyed last month repeated her call for parliament to block the platform.

9,Cop dies in Damascus car bombing,DAMASCUS: A Syrian policeman was killed and four others wounded on Wednesday in a car bomb attack on a Damascus...,"DAMASCUS: A Syrian policeman was killed and four others wounded on Wednesday in a car bomb attack on a Damascus police station that was claimed by the militant Islamic State group.
The Syrian interior ministry said a vehicle exploded at the Barzeh police station in the north of the capital, killing a lieutenant colonel and wounding four others.
“Investigations are ongoing to discover the circumstances of the incident,” it added in a statement, posting images of a mangled, burnt-out vehicle.
The IS group later claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its members had  “managed to plant and detonate an explosive device on a vehicle inside a police station”, in a statement on its Telegram channels.
It was a rare jihadist attack in Damascus, which has been largely spared such violence in recent years, especially since the government retook the last rebel bastion near the capital in 2018. But security incidents, including blasts targeting military or civilian vehicles, occur intermittently in Damascus.
Sometimes they are part of personal disputes or score-settling in the country, where the security situation is tenuous more than 12 years after its civil war erupted, according to the Observatory.
In October 2022, a bomb attack on a Syrian army bus near Damascus killed at least 24 soldiers.

10,Scientists claim ‘new age of genetic diagnosis’,"PARIS: Scientists on Wednesday unveiled the first draft of a human “pangenome”, a more diverse and accurate DNA...","PARIS: Scientists on Wednesday unveiled the first draft of a human “pangenome”, a more diverse and accurate DNA blueprint for our species that they hope will help shed light on a range of diseases.
The announcement was hailed by researchers as a major scientific milestone that “heralds a new age of genetic diagnosis”.
The first human genome was sequenced in 2003, providing a reference point for all other human sequences to be compared to. The breakthrough allowed scientists to identify genes that cause specific diseases, paved the way for the still growing field of personalised medicine, and shed new light on human evolution.
However, 70 per cent of the genetic data for this original genome reference came from a single person — a man who answered a newspaper advert in Buffalo, New York in 1997 — with snippets from 20 others.
This meant it had many gaps and did not work as well as a reference for people from other ethnicities and races, prompting concerns about bias and inequality.
In a series of papers published in the journal Nature, a large team of international researchers described the first draft of a more inclusive “pangenome” reference that they say more accurately reflects humanity.
The group, called the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, said they have now compiled the genomes of 47 people from different backgrounds — and plan to increase that number to 350 by the middle of next year.

11,Google takes wraps off its answer to Microsoft’s AI search challenge,The effort will be most closely watched as Google executives take the stage at its yearly conference I/O in California.,"MOUNTAIN VIEW (California, US): Alphabet Inc’s Google on Wednesday unveiled more artificial intelligence in its products to answer the latest competition from Microsoft Corp, which has threatened its perch atop the nearly $300 billion search advertising market.
Through an internal project code-named Magi, Google has looked to infuse its namesake engine with generative AI, technology that can answer questions with human-like prose and derive new content from past data.
The effort will be the most closely watched as Google executives take the stage at its yearly conference I/O in Mountain View, California, near its headquarters. The result could alter how consumers access the world’s information and which company wins the global market for search advertising, estimated by research firm MAGNA to be $286 billion this year.
“We are reimagining all of our core products, including search,” Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s CEO, said after he took the stage at the event.
He said Google is integrating generative AI into search and other products, including Gmail, where it can create draft messages, and Google Photos, where it can make major changes to images.
Alphabet shares rose 2.5 per cent after the news. They have risen by a fifth so far this year, compared with a 17pc rise in the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index.
Now, Google is making its ChatGPT competitor, Bard, multimodal like OpenAI’s GPT-4, the company said on Wednesday, and will make it accessible to people in more than 180 countries and territories.
That means customers will be able to prompt Bard with images, not just text — for instance asking the chatbot to write a caption to a picture they hand it, it said.
Behind Bard also is a more powerful AI model Google announced called PaLM 2, which it said could solve tougher problems. PaLM 2 is currently available as a preview.
Pichai said one of its PaLM 2 models is lightweight enough to work on smartphones. The Bard chatbot is now running on PaLM 2, the company said.
