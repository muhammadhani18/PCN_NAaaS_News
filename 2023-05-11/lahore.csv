3,"Tension mounts as protesters, policemen injured in clashes","Protesters ransack Shadman police station, PML-N office, burn vehicles","LAHORE: Tension continued to flare up on second day of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s agitation in Punjab when a large number of its workers took to the streets and turned violent in some parts of the province, particularly, in Lahore.
On Wednesday, dozens of PTI workers forced their entry into the Shadman police station, Lahore, and damaged the furniture and the official vehicles.
Similarly, a charged mob of the PTI protesters clashed with the police outside the Governor House when they tried to enter the building.  
A heavy contingent of police reached the spot and foiled the attempt of the protesters by intensifying security in and around the Governor House.

Protesters ransack Shadman police station, PML-N office, burn vehicles

At a number of other places, the protesters turned violent, damaged public property and burnt police vehicles.
Some of the agitators ransacked an office of the PML-N in Model Town.  
There were reports that dozens of PTI workers got injured in the severe clashes erupted with the police, particularly, at Gulberg where the situation remained tense.
Sources said the police used massive force to arrest the protesting party workers when they rushed for shelter in nearby commercial buildings and plazas at the Main Boulevard, Gulberg.
Following the situation, a spokesperson for the Punjab police released the official figures of arrests of the PTI workers.  
He said the Punjab police and other law-enforcement agencies arrested nearly 1,380 workers of the PTI for carrying out violent attacks on the sensitive official buildings, vehicles and other state-owned properties.
According to the police reports, the arrests of the PTI workers were made on the reports of vandalism at public places.  
The spokesperson further claimed that over 145 police personnel, including Lahore DIG Operation Nasir Rizvi, three SPs and dozens of SHOs were injuredin the clashes across the province.
Of them, 63 police officials were injured in Lahore, 28 in Rawalpindi, 21 in Faisalabad, 13 in Gujranwala, 10 in Attock, six in Mianwali and five in Sialkot.

The first information report was lodged on the complaint of police inspector Aftab Nawaz Khan who alleged that a charged mob of nearly 80 PTI workers was carrying petrol bombs, rods and clubs when they attacked the main gate of the building at Club Chowk.
He alleged that PTI leader Hammad Azhar was leading the mob at that time and they later fled the scene after damaging the public property.
The protesters were accused of chanting slogans against the Pakistan Army, judiciary and using ‘objectionable’ language against the sensitive institution of the country. They created terror and fear on the public place, he said.
Meanwhile, no official or authentic information was available regarding total number of deaths of the PTI workers or passers-by in Lahore on Wednesday.

4,Attack on Corps Commander’s House: Audio leaks suggest PTI leadership was on board,Dr Yasmin Rashid says she has never instructed anyone to torch the house and terms viral audio a “doctored clip”.,"LAHORE: Several audio leaks apparently involving Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders on Wednesday seem to suggest the party leadership was instigating its workers to attack the Lahore’s Corps Commander’s House in Cantonment.
While some leaders were urging party workers to gather at the Corps Commander House, party ticket-holder Ibad Farooq claimed PTI central Punjab President Dr Yasmin Rashid had clearly instructed them to set it to fire.
Dr Yasmin Rashid, presently on the run to avoid arrest, told Dawn that it was a “doctored audio clip” as she had never instructed anyone to torch the house. “I have just gone there to stage a sit-in to protest her leader’s arrest.
Dr Rashid said some workers had even tried to persuade her to storm the airport and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s residence in Jati Umra “but I was asking them to return to the Liberty Roundabout for a sit-in there.”
The PTI leader alleged that her party’s opponents in power had also fielded their workers who sabotaged and ransacked the army house in Lahore. “This was a complete conspiracy.”
She said party chief Imran Khan had given clear instructions to all leaders and workers to remain peaceful and added that she kept asking workers through megaphone to remain calm. She also condemned all those who stole various household articles from the army house.
According to her, it was surprising that no policeman or soldier was guarding the Corps Commander’s House when charged workers reached there.
Dr Rashid recalled that she was very much concerned when PTI workers had responded violently to the police operation to arrest Imran Khan from Zaman Park on March 15. In an audio clip leaked then, she was talking to President Dr Arif Alvi, urging him to tell Mr Khan to give in and fight another day“. She went on to say that petrol bombs had been thrown on police and a water canon had been set ablaze. “If Khan sahab does not give in, the situation warrants that some people or some policemen may die.”
Dr Rashid said some 100 policemen had raided her residence on Tuesday night, damaged a computer, a phone set and some household articles. She said the police had entered her home after breaking the windows, took her husband and brother Sajid Nabi Malik. “Later, the police released my husband but the whereabouts of Sajid Nabi Malik were still unknown,” she added.
In a leaked audio clip with party leader Ijaz Minhas, Dr Rashid can be heard asking whether she along with workers should move to the Liberty Roundabout or continue sitting there.
As Mr Minhas suggested her to ask other leaders, she expressed her ignorance about “them”. The party leader suggested her to move to Liberty Roundabout since they had left the sit-in venue (purportedly Corps Commander House). “Since you left the venue, the Liberty Roundabout is the best place to sit,” he stated and suggested her to give a call for the night.
In a tweet, PTI central Punjab president urged party workers to “protest, but do not take law in your hands. Beware of rogue elements from other parties/institutions, engaging you to resort to illegal methods”. She said the PTI was fighting for Pakistan.
In another tweet, she stated the PTI senior leadership was being arrested after the arrest of Imran Khan. She also said the protesters and supporters, including women and children, were being attacked and added internet services and social media had been blocked.
In yet another purported leaked audio clip, PTI Senator Ejaz Chaudhry could be heard telling another person – believed to be his son Ali Chaudhry – the protesters had ransacked the Corps Commander House and everything in the house including the flowerpots had been destroyed. He stated three people also sustained bullet injuries.
When Ali Chaudhry asked that shots were fired as well, Senator Chaudhry replied in the affirmative saying first they fired shots and then a burst of gun fire and added that three people were hit by bullets. “Nothing is left in the house. From flowerpot to everything has been blown away,” the PTI senator added. Senator Chaudhry’s son remarked that “Myth has been broken”.
There are some other party leaders’ leaked audio clips discussing protest demonstration at the Corps Commander’s House.
PROTEST: Meanwhile, Lahore on Wednesday wore almost a deserted look as there was thin traffic on roads and the police blocked Liberty Roundabout and Canal Road near Zaman Park to control PTI workers’ protests. Still a large number of party workers managed to reach the Liberty Roundabout to stage sit-in.
Meanwhile, owing to blockade of roads, the PTI leaders announced shifting the protest venue from Liberty Chowk to party office at Jail Road, which was also cordoned off by the police Police reportedly raided various PTI leaders and activists’ homes and arrested them or their relatives present there.
PTI leader Shirin Mazari tweeted that the police also launched another attack with heavy shelling at Imran Khan’s Zaman Park residence, when his wife along with some domestic staff was at home.
WHEEL-JAM: PTI central Punjab general secretary Hammad Azhar has given a call for “Wheel-jam strike” on Thursday (today) and closure of all markets in Lahore to express solidarity with party chief Imran Khan.
Mr Azhar tweeted that peaceful protests will continue till the release of Mr Khan and urged the party workers to be alert from “certain Gullu Butt elements” joining their ranks.
The PTI leader also tweeted that police resorted to heavy shelling and use of water cannons towards protesters. “They are literally attacking their own citizens – incredibly disgusting,” he lamented.

Mr Dogar was given the additional charge after the recently appointed DIG Operation Lahore Ali Nasir Rizvi got injured during a clash with the PTI workers on Tuesday.
The police said that Mr Rizvi was leading the force when it responded to the emergency call about violent agitation by a group of PTI workers marching towards Cantonment area of Lahore.

6,Clashes in parts of Lahore as military called in,The streets of Lahore saw heavy deployment of law enforcement agencies on Wednesday as protests that broke out after...,"The streets of Lahore saw heavy deployment of law enforcement agencies on Wednesday as protests that broke out after PTI chief Imran Khan’s arrest a day before were expected to intensify.  
One of the most symbolic demonstrations, the videos of which have been seen far and wide despite the government’s blackout of YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, was the ransack of Jinnah House – the official residence of the Lahore corps commander. On Tuesday, protests had spread like wildfire – an apt metaphor considering how the smell of burned trees and tyres continued to linger on many roads in the Cantonment area well into the next day. 
Contrary to claims on social media that most roads in the city were blocked, we discovered that getting access to sites of protest and cordoned-off spaces was a matter of improvisation. 
Certain familiar check posts, such as the ones at the entrance to Cantt through RA Bazaar had been removed. One of the lanes was blocked and the other was opened for two-way traffic without any checking. Inside the Cantonment, Speedo busses could be seen on their designated routes, indicating that a sense of normalcy had returned. The metal sculptures and the botanical clock at Girja Chowk were charred and the National Bank of Pakistan’s ATM was completely smashed. Tufail Road was open for traffic up to a certain point. The police were cordoning off one road and leaving the other open for two-way traffic. Several traffic junctions carried smoldering remains of burnt tyres and wood. 
Beginning at Girja Chowk, you can see and smell burning trees. The bus stops on both sides of the road were burned completely. The charred remains of several old trees littered the sidewalk which had been dismantled brick by brick in many places. Stationed at the blockade on Tufail Road, Constable Naveed confirmed that the protests at Jinnah House had died out around 3am on Tuesday night. Early morning on Wednesday, the Lahore Waste Management Company launched its clean-up operation with bulldozers and cranes to remove the debris from the road. All the ornamental flowerpots at various traffic junctions and along Tufail Road had been smashed as well. 
“What can I tell you about the damage, go look at it yourself,” the constable said. 
Interestingly, the mall in front of Jinnah House on Tufail Road, which is owned by the same real estate tycoon implicated in the Al Qadir Trust case, Malik Riaz, was untouched. This is metaphoric of how the entire episode has played out since Tuesday, especially considering the damage incurred to Jinnah House and other government-owned buildings in the area.  
According to security officials, the guardroom at the entrance of the corps commander’s residence was torched after the protesters entered the area. Then they entered an annex and torched several rooms. In the videos circulating since the night before, protesters can be seen carrying out food items and miscellaneous decorative pieces from the house, insisting that their demonstration wasn’t about stealing expensive items but a symbolic gesture against “theft of the nation’s wealth”. 
Leaving Cantt, you can smell burning tyres all the way to Sherpao Bridge. Most of Jail Road was clear for traffic, however, the Canal was blocked for traffic moving towards the Upper Mall. A traffic policeman warned that there was intense shelling and teargas on the bridge over Faiz Ahmed Faiz Underpass, however, as with Tufail Road in Cantt, the other side of the Canal was being used for two-way traffic. I could see smoke wafting over the bridge from afar, and as I grew closer the teargas got intense and I had to turn around. 
By evening, the military had been stationed in Lahore and other main cities of Punjab after being summoned under Article 245 by the provincial government. 
A portion of Gulberg’s Main Boulevard was open for traffic, however, Liberty Chowk was blocked by police checkpoints on Noor Jehan Road near the Gaddafi Stadium and Liberty Market, and Main Boulevard. On social media platforms that had not been blacked out, word was that the main PTI protest would be held at Liberty Chowk. 
Vehicles weren’t allowed; however, protesters could walk to the roundabout. A heavy contingent of riot police in full gear stood in the middle of the Liberty Chowk. A few women tried to run toward the white structure in the middle of the roundabout and I suppose that wasn’t allowed because the riot police ran toward them, grabbed them forcefully and put them in a prison van. We were in front of Big City Plaza casually taking photographs when we saw the riot police start running in our direction. we stood to a side, and they ran past me into the plaza shouting and wielding batons and large sticks. 
“Go home woman,” one of the policemen said to me. We asked who the police were looking for inside the plaza, and he said they were expecting trouble. 
“But isn’t this where PTI workers are supposed to hold their protest?” we asked. And he shook his head, saying “they’re all scoundrels.” 
This is reflective of the intense polarisation we witnessed among shopkeepers and bystanders who were either reluctant to share any information about what they had seen or vehemently condemned the agitation.  
Punjab’s caretaker chief minister visited the Safe City Authority headquarters to monitor the protests and deploy law enforcement forces, wherever required. A large number of people on both sides – law enforcement and civilians – were injured in the clashes that ensued. As of now, the situation on the streets mirrors the grim mood on social media platforms and will take time to return to some semblance of normalcy.

“We deplore the use of disproportionate force [used] in arresting Mr Khan from the premises of the Islamabad High Court. It was clearly unwarranted and has only aggravated the political climate,” says a statement by the commission on Wednesday. 
The HRCP condemned the violence perpetrated both by security and law enforcement personnel – in which at least one person was reportedly killed – as well as by enraged protesters. Stressing the need for restraint and political dialogue, the HRCP said respect for the rule of law must apply equally to all citizens and in all situations – it cannot be applied selectively. 
HRCP was also alarmed to see that the state’s knee-jerk reaction to the crisis was to restrict internet connectivity. As before, such steps achieve little apart from allowing dangerous rumours to circulate and compromising people’s access to information and their safety in public spaces, it added. 
HRCP urged all political stakeholders to use peaceful, democratic means, such as the forum of the parliament to settle their differences, rather than resorting to violence, intimidation and thuggery.

8,Speedo bus firm serves Rs50m arrears notice on govt,Bus fleet has already been reduced from12 to six,"BAHAWALPUR: The future of Speedo bus service seems to be in limbo as the company has served a notice on the Punjab government for the payment of its arrears to the tune of Rs50 million.  
The government had last year restored the service launched in 2018 between Bahawalpur and Lodhran to facilitate the local travelling public particularly thousands of students belonging to rural areas studying in several educational institutions of Bahawalpur. The Speedo buses were given on lease to the Punjab government by a private transport company on a monthly rent.  
In the beginning, there were 12 buses in the fleet restored last year. But now six buses are shuttling between Lodhran and Bahawalpur to cater to the travelling needs of the students and the general public who face inconvenience due to decrease in the number of buses. During last year, the company had demanded that the Punjab transport department pay its dues for previous months. The company claims that the government has failed to pay its arrears.  
A source told Dawn that now the company has served a notice on the Punjab government to pay its arrears amounting to over Rs50m by May 17. The company had informed the provincial government that if the required payment was not made, the Speedo bus service might be stopped simultaneously from Lodhran and Bahawalpur.

Bus fleet has already been reduced from12 to six

The officials of the local administration told this correspondent that efforts were afoot to contact the provincial government high-ups in this connection so that the company could be paid its outstanding amount by the deadline. 
COTTON: The district administration has sought the cooperation of lumbardars, cotton growers and ginners to make the Punjab government’s cotton-grow campaign a complete success in the district.  
In this connection, a convention of the growers was held here on Tuesday.  
The lumbardars across the district were also invited to the convention, addressed by Deputy Commissioner Bhawalpur Zaheer Anwar Jappa, who urged the farming community to make best use of the incentives to increase the per acre yield in the coming season.  
He informed them that the district administration had established five facilitation centres at Bahawalpur city, Ahmedpur East, Hasilpur,Yazman and Khairpur Tamewali from where they would be able to get seed, fertiliser and other agricultural inputs at subsidised rates.  
The DC urged the lumbardars to cooperate with the farming community to motivate them for the cultivation of cotton on maximum area.  
The convention was also addressed by the officials of the agriculture extension wing who informed the farmers that the government would award them cash prizes and hold a cotton competition. He said cotton would be sown on an area of 787,000 acres in the district and so far cultivated on 417,000 acres.
