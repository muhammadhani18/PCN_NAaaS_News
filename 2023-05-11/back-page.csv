Syrian President Bashar al-Assad receives an invitation from King Salman bin Abdulaziz through Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to Jordan Naif Bin Bandar Al-Sudairi to attend the Arab League summit, on Wednesday.—Reuters

DAMASCUS: Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz has invited Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad to attend an Arab League summit in the Gulf country on May 19, Syrian state media reported on Wednesday.
Arab foreign ministers had on Sunday agreed that Syria could resume its role in the body, 12 years after its membership was suspended over Assad’s crackdown on protests against him.
Assad said the summit “will enhance joint Arab action to achieve the aspirations of the Arab peoples,” it said in a statement.
Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Jordan, Nayef bin Bandar al-Sudairi, delivered the invitation, according to Saudi state news agency SPA.

Russia says roadmap in the works to mend Syria-Turkiye ties

He conveyed the King and his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “wishes to the brotherly government and people of Syria for security and stability,” SPA said.
The invitation comes a day after Riyadh and Damascus announced that work would resume at their respective diplomatic missions in Syria and Saudi Arabia, after more than a decade of severed relations.
‘Roadmap’
Russia said that a roadmap to normalise ties between Syria and Turkiye will be drafted following a meeting of their foreign ministers in Moscow.
Earlier on Wednesday the foreign ministers of Turkiye and Syria held their first official meeting since the start of the Syrian civil war.
The talks in the Russian capital also involved the top diplomats of Russia and Iran.
The ministers had agreed to task their deputies with putting together a “‘roadmap’ to advance ties between Turkiye and Syria” in coordination with the defence ministers and security services of the four countries, Moscow said in a statement.
“The ministers noted the positive and constructive atmosphere of the exchange of views and agreed to continue high-level contacts,” the Russian foreign ministry added.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the proposals could then be put to the leaders of Iran, Russia, Syria and Turkiye.
“Our task is to determine the general guidelines for further progress,” Lavrov said at the meeting.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Tehran welcomed the start of the talks between Syria and Turkiye.
“We deeply believe that these two countries can put the past behind them and by looking to the future resolve their bilateral issues through dialogue and deepening cooperation based on good neighbourliness,” he said.
He pointed to “the transition process in the world order” and “the decline of American power”.
In April, Moscow also hosted four-way talks involving the countries’ defence ministers.
Turkiye supported early rebel efforts to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, keeping a military presence in northern stretches of the war-torn country that angers Damascus.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has made up with former rivals across the region and is now courting a presidential summit with Assad.
Kremlin mediation would give President Vladimir Putin diplomatic clout with Russia isolated internationally over Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine.
Damascus is a staunch ally of Moscow, which intervened in the civil war in 2015, launching air strikes to support the government’s struggling forces.

1,"Israel, Palestinians trade deadly fire",Seven Palestinians killed in latest strikes; Israel claims 270 rockets launched from Gaza,"GAZA CITY: Israel’s army and Gaza fighters traded heavy cross-border fire on Wednesday, with 22 Palestinians killed over two days amid the worst escalation of violence to hit the coastal territory in months.
Sirens in the Tel Aviv area and Israel’s south warned of incoming rockets in a fresh evening salvo, with an agency reporter in Gaza observing dozens of launches as Israeli officials said Egypt was working on a possible truce with the group Islamic Jihad.
Earlier in the day, smoke billowed from the densely populated coastal enclave after Israel announced it was targeting rocket launch sites of the Islamic Jihad.
Gaza’s health ministry said seven people were killed, a day after Israeli strikes on the Palestinian territory left 15 dead.

Seven Palestinians killed in latest strikes; Israel claims 270 rockets launched from Gaza

In a joint statement Palestinian factions said “hundreds of rockets” were fired, while the Israeli army claimed over 270 launches from Gaza prior to the latest salvos.
Four of those killed on Wednesday were fighters with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the group said in a statement.
The fatalities also included a 10-year-old girl, whose body was seen by a journalist in Gaza City’s Shifa hospital.
Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency service said it had received no immediate reports of casualties.
Israel’s Iron Dome air defence system intercepted rockets above the coastal city of Ashkelon and elsewhere in the south.
Egypt ceasefire efforts
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was “ready for the possibility of an expanded campaign and harsh strikes against Gaza,” in a meeting with local leaders near the coastal territory.
Later in the day, an Israeli official said on condition of anonymity that Egypt was “trying to facilitate a ceasefire,” which would be evaluated “based on acts on the ground and not Islamic Jihad declarations”.
Sources in Gaza close to the Islamic Jihad and Hamas confirmed Egyptian efforts to secure a truce, without providing further details.
The latest violence comes a day after Israeli strikes on Gaza killed three Islamic Jihad members and 12 others, including four children, according to a health ministry toll.
Speaking to public broadcaster Channel 11, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said the Islamic Jihad was pushing for a truce. “It’s clear why Jihad are begging for a ceasefire,” Cohen said of Israel’s surprise attack. “They didn’t expect that blow.” Islamic Jihad had vowed on Tuesday to retaliate, with Israel warning its residents near the border to stay near bomb shelters.
Ahead of Wednesday’s exchange of fire, Gaza’s usually bustling shops were closed. People in Gaza “expect the worst”, said resident Monther Abdullah.
“Everyone feels anxious and people aren’t on the street much. I definitely feel like there’s a war coming,” the 50-year-old said.
The latest violence comes on the second anniversary of a devastating 11-day war fought between Gaza fighters and Israel. Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou said on Wednesday “the strikes of the unified resistance are part of the process of responding to the massacre committed by (Israel).”
Among those killed on Tuesday were four children and three adults.

2,No quick EU deal in sight on Russia sanctions,EU Commission president says new sanctions would focus on cracking down on the circumvention of Russia trade curbs already in place.,"BRUSSELS: European Union states were holding a first discussion on Wednesday on proposed new sanctions over Russia’s war in Ukraine that would target Chinese and Iranian firms and allow export curbs on third countries for busting trade restrictions.
Talks among the EU envoys were set to be heated, according to one diplomat, with Russia hawks upset the plan does not go far enough but others wary of damaging their international ties.
Widely differing perspectives mean a quick deal is not expected, several diplomats said.
The EU’s chief executive unveiled the plan on a symbolic trip to Kyiv on Tuesday — a counterbalance to annual celebrations in Moscow of the World War II victory over Nazi Germany that President Vladimir Putin likens to his invasion of Ukraine.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the new sanctions would focus on cracking down on the circumvention of Russia trade curbs already in place, and were designed “in very close coordination” with Group of Seven nations.
She said the EU would stop transit via Russia of more of its exports, including advanced tech products and aircraft parts.

3,Pakistan welcomes Saudi peace efforts in Sudan,Negotiations between Sudanese army and rival paramilitary RSF group commenced on Saturday in Jeddah.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan on Wednesday welcomed efforts of Saudi Arabia for peace in Sudan and to facilitate the pre-negotiation talks in Jeddah between representatives of Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces geared to reaching a short-term ceasefire agreement and subsequent delivery of emergency humanitarian assistance to those affected by the conflict.
“Pakistan reiterates its principled support for a political solution to the Sudan situation through dialogue and consultation,” the Foreign Office said in a brief statement.
Negotiations between the Sudanese army and the rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) group commenced on Saturday in Jeddah, a day after envoys of two warring generals of Sudan reached Saudi Arabia for talks aimed at firming up a shaky ceasefire after three weeks of fierce fighting that has killed hundreds.
The negotiations are the first between Sudan’s military, led by Gen Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, commanded by Gen Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, since clashes broke out on April 15.
The preliminary talks will “continue over the following days in the hope of reaching an effective and temporary ceasefire so that humanitarian aid can be delivered to those in need”, the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday.
The two sides have agreed to multiple truces since the fighting started, but none has effectively taken hold, with both parties blaming each other for violating them.

WASHINGTON/LONDON: As Pakistani Americans took to the streets across the United States on Wednesday to vent their anger at the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan, the US administration acknowledged its awareness of the incarceration but refused to take sides, while Britain said the arrest “is an internal matter” of Pakistan.
In a carefully-worded reaction to Mr Khan’s arrest in Islamabad on Tuesday, the US State Department told Dawn: “We are aware of the arrest of the former Pakistani prime minister” and “as we have said before, the United States does not have a position on one political candidate or party versus another”.
Even while underlining Washington’s support for the democratic process, the department made sure that it was not Pakistan-specific. “We call for the respect of democratic principles and the rule of law around the world,” the department’s spokesperson said.
The Pakistani American community, however, had no reluctance in showing their anger at the arrest, holding protest rallies and meetings in more than a dozen American and Canadian cities.

Thousands take to streets against Imran’s arrest in American, Canadian cities

In Washington, a crowd gathered outside Pakistan House, the official residence of the Pakistani ambassador, chanting slogans against the PDM government and the military.
Organisers claimed that Petroleum Minister Musadik Malik and his team were inside, and the protest forced the embassy to cancel a dinner it was hosting for Mr Malik and his guests.
The embassy, however, refused to confirm or deny their claim but did issue a statement late Tuesday evening, informing journalists that a Wednesday morning media interaction with the minister had been cancelled. The crowd condemned Mr Khan’s arrest, demanded his immediate release, and chanted slogans against senior military commanders.
PTI supporters held a larger rally outside the Pakistan Embassy on Wednesday, chanting similar slogans and demanding Imran Khan’s release. A larger protest was held at Times Square in New York. Mr Khan’s former media adviser Shahbaz Gill addressed the crowd, urging them to “continue your protest for as long as it takes to restore democracy”.
Rallies were also held in Houston, Dallas, Chicago, Columbus, Ohio, and at two places in the state of Michigan.
 






But North America’s largest protest rally of Pakistani Americans in recent memory was held in Toronto, Canada.
 






Thousands participated in this rally, singing patriotic songs and chanting slogans. More rallies are planned across the United States and Canada.
Internal matter
Responding to a question asked by an MP during PMQs, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: “The arrest of the former prime minister [Imran Khan] is an internal matter for Pakistan. We support peaceful democratic processes and adherence to the rule of law and we are monitoring the situation carefully.”
 






He was responding to an MP who called for the British prime minister to respond to the “real concerns” about the circumstances around Mr Khan’s arrest and detention.
PTI supporters gathered outside the Pakistan High Commission in London, as well as outside the apartment of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, demanding justice and condemning the government.
