0,Ruling alliance castigates PTI for violence,KARACHI: The Pakistan Peoples Party and its allied parties in the federal government on Wednesday vehemently...,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Peoples Party and its allied parties in the federal government on Wednesday vehemently condemned the violent activities in the aftermath of Imran Khan’s arrest with PPP-led Sindh Government vowing that those involved in such activities would not be spared.
Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah said that the PTI workers also damaged private cars and buildings, the assessment of which is being carried out. “I want every culprit involved in violent activities arrested,” he said.
He said that PTI workers blocked Sharea Faisal and some other roads which affected the daily lives of millions of people commuting between their workplaces and residences.
The chief minister directed police to ensure peace and safety of public and private property, as well as unblock all roads to ensure free and smooth movement so the residents could get to their destinations without hassle.
“The police took necessary measures, including arrests and clearance of roads, to maintain law and order and to prevent further damage to any public or private property,” he added.
The CM visited several areas at night (between Monday & Tuesday) to ensure that peace prevails in the city and anyone causing any threat to the safety and security of life and property is dealt with strictly under the law.
The chief minister again inspected important areas and roads in the morning and afternoon of Wednesday and urged the peaceful residents of Karachi to cooperate with the law enforcement agencies and abide by the law to ensure every citizen’s safety and security.
Imran arrested because of corruption, says Sharjeel
Addressing a press conference, Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that several political leaders had been arrested several times in the country, but none had ever staged such a violent protest as the one carried out by the PTI on Tuesday.
He said that Imran Khan had to satisfy the courts and NAB in the Al Qadir case. “Imran Khan was arrested because of his corruption, and he is not being targeted for political revenge,” he added.
Mr Memon said that if the PTI wished to stage protests, appropriate venues and facilities would be provided.
Sindh Government Spokesman Barrister Murtaza Wahab said that terrorism cases were being registered against those who surrounded and tortured the police officers and citizens.
At a press conference, he said that people saw how the PTI workers tried to make the entire nation a prisoner for the sake of one person’s arrogance. “PTI is the name of destruction, not change,” he added.
Meanwhile, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, Mohajir Qaumi Movement and Awami National Party condemned the violence in the city in the aftermath of PTI chief’s arrest.
MQM-P Convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui told a press conference here that there was never such a violent protest against the arrests of the party worker by MQM-P. 
“If there has been any protest from our side, it has always been political not violent,” he said, adding that the party never directed party workers and supporters to protest against the state.
ANP Sindh President Shahi Syed said the violent activities after PTI chief’s arrest proved that Imran Khan was a big ‘fitna’.
He said that attacks were also carried out on government buildings, including ambulances and hospitals. 
Also, Mohajir Qaumi Movement chairman Afaq Ahmed condemned the violence and said that protest  against any government decision or initiative was a part of democracy,  but it should be peaceful.

1,Suspect ‘who tried to target Chinese workers’ killed in ‘encounter’ in Karachi,"“Two terrorists tried to kill Chinese citizens at Dawood Jetty. After an exchange of firing, one terrorist was killed and the other escaped,"" police say.","KARACHI: A suspected militant, who allegedly planned to target Chinese citizens working on a project in the city, was killed in an alleged encounter on Wednesday.
“Two terrorists tried to kill the Chinese at Dawood Jetty. After an exchange of firing, one terrorist was killed while the other managed to escape,” a police statement said, adding that Constable Akram Ali also suffered a bullet wound in the shoot-out.
Senior Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official Raja Umer Khattab, who visited the spot, told Dawn that Chinese workers were involved in repair work of ships at the jetty. 
He said there was a drain near the sea from where one armed assailant attempted to enter and target Chinese workers, but he was spotted by a policeman who opened fire on him.
He, however, clarified that it was a not a China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.
DIG Muhammad Kashif, who is responsible for the security of the CPEC-related projects, told the media that there were more than 30 foreigners working at the jetty for the repairing of the ships. He said that four policemen were deployed at the check post.
Initially, the police suspected that the assailant wore a suicide vest to carry out a suicide attack. The Bomb Disposal Squad was called, which after examining declared that it was not a suicide vest.
Sukkan SHO Rao Zaheer said that the incident took place at a Chinese firm — Hong Kong River. 
He claimed to have recovered one Kalashnikov and two magazines from his possession. He said the identity of the deceased could not be ascertained till late in the night.

2,Karachi endures year’s hottest day as mercury surges to 39°C,"“The high pressure system is likely to spread in a week, creating hot and dry conditions in most parts of the country,"" says chief meteorologist.","KARACHI: The city experienced its hottest day of the current year on Wednesday when temperature rose to 39 degrees Celsius with 21 per cent relative humidity.
On Tuesday, the maximum temperature recorded in the city was 36.1°C with 47pc relative humidity.
Chief Meteorologist Dr S. Sarfaraz told Dawn that in recent years Karachi’s highest temperature in May was 46°C in 2018.
The city experienced hot day under the influence of a high pressure system in the upper atmosphere currently affecting southern parts of the country.

“The high pressure system is likely to spread in a week, creating hot and dry conditions in most parts of the country. The weather in Karachi, however, is likely to improve in two days due to the sea-breeze’s effect,” Dr Sarfaraz said.
The Met department has forecast hot and humid weather in the city on Thursday (today) with maximum temperature ranging between 36°C and 38°C.

3,Students in distress as British Council cancels O/A level exams again,Some worry that their grades will be affected if marks awarded on the basis of other papers,"KARACHI: Just like Wednesday, the British Council, responsible for holding examinations including the Cambridge O and A level exams and University of London exams in Pakistan, has cancelled all exams scheduled for Thursday (today) morning and afternoon in view of the developing security situation in the country.
The cancellation caused happiness as well as grief to many candidates. Several students took to social media and said that they would love it for such cancellations to happen for the entire week. 
Since Cambridge International has said that they will give marks for the papers cancelled on the basis of another paper of the same subject given earlier, some students were also worried that they had not done too well on the other paper and were hoping to make up for that in the other paper.
“Our grades will be affected badly,” pointed out one student. 

Some worry that their grades will be affected if marks awarded on the basis of other papers

So upset was an O level student whose chemistry paper was cancelled, that he suggested on social media to his friends that they storm the British Council and solve the paper forcefully. 
One parent said that her daughter had worked very hard the entire year but both her major science subjects’ papers got cancelled. Another parent said that that it would affect a student’s future, especially if science or medicine were her major career goals. 
One student said that she didn’t even celebrate Eid as she was studying hard for her exams.
“We are working here day and night for a bright future and here we were just engulfed by darkness because of the ‘situation’ in our country,” said one student. 
Several others were considering appearing in October/November. “But that would mean paying through our noses again,” said one mother. 
There are also some students who have a scholarship to see them through their A levels in college, which requires 100 per cent results. They were worried that grades being awarded on the basis on their first paper may affect their scholarship. 
Many students were thinking that maybe the paper was not cancelled but postponed because they had heard that the IELTS would be rescheduled by the British Council. But they had to be jolted out of there misconception. 
And with all this happening, some students were still in denial, wondering that maybe the British Council’s notification about cancellation of papers was fake. But there was, in fact, some fake news, too, about all exams cancelled till June 1. The cancellations were happening only after examining the situation on a day-to-day basis. 
Sindh govt warns private schools
Meanwhile, the School Education and Literacy Department of the Directorate of Inspection and Registration of Private Institutions, Sindh has warned all principals and administrations of privately-managed schools to keep their schools open as usual. 
“The institutions found closed on their own accord will see strict action taken against them and their registration shall be canceled immediately,” the letter said.

4,"Two wastewater projects hit by paucity of funds, KWSB tells SHC",DHA says Sepa inspected sewage treatment plant at Golf Club,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday summoned the project director of sewage treatment plants (STPs) along with relevant record as the Karachi Water & Sewerage Board (KWSB) sought time to file a detailed report about functioning of STPs.
A lawyer for the Defence Housing Authority also informed the SHC that in pursuance of its last order, one of the two DHA’s treatment plants at Golf Club had been inspected by a team of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) and a comprehensive report would be filed on the next hearing.
The KWSB in its statement stated that the construction work on Lyari interceptor under the Greater Karachi Sewerage Project, commonly known as S-III, was almost completed while repair and extension work on STP-I and STP-III was still in progress, but work on Malir interceptor and STP-IV could not be started due to lack of funds.
A two-judge bench, headed by Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, was hearing a petition filed by some non-governmental organisations in 2017 against release of untreated effluent and industrial waste into the sea.

DHA says Sepa inspected sewage treatment plant at Golf Club

When the hearing began, a lawyer for the KWSB filed a statement along with annexure and requested for time to file a comprehensive report about functioning of STP-I and II as well as STP-IV to be installed in Korangi.
On the last hearing, the bench had expressed displeasure over the DHA for disallowing Sepa access to one of its two STPs for inspection and directed the authority to ensure inspection of the treatment plant by a team of Sepa.
On Wednesday, the counsel for DHA informed the bench that inspection of STP had been completed.
While adjourning the hearing till May 23, the bench directed the project director to be in attendance on the next hearing along with the relevant record.
The KWSB in its statement submitted that S-III was designed to treat around 500 million gallons per day (MGD) of municipal sewerage as existing sewage disposal system lacked treatment facilities and required conveyance network for the sewage to divert it to the treatment plants which was currently being discharged into the sea untreated.
It further stated that the major component of S-III was establishment of STP-IV in Korangi area, near discharge of the Malir river into sea, along with construction of interceptors in Malir and Lyari rivers as well as expansion of STP-I (Site) and STP-III (Mauripur).
However, due to paucity of funds, construction work on Malir interceptor and STP-IV could not be started and thus, Sindh government has taken up the project with the assistance of public-private partnership and Asian Development Bank is carrying out the feasibility of the project and it may include construction and transfer of a new wastewater interceptor (Malir) with a length of around 22 kilometres, it maintained.
The KWSB in its statement further submitted that the Public-Private Partnership Policy Board in its meeting held in October last year under chairmanship of chief minister Sindh had unanimously approved launching of pre-qualification document for wastewater treatment plant (IV).
On the last hearing, Sepa in its report stated that the DHA had installed two treatment plants with a capacity of 2.4MGD and 2MGD, while DHA was generating around eight million gallons per day (MGD) sewage; out of which 3.33MGD was being disposed of into the sea without treatment.
The report also said that the city was generating 472MGD waste while optimum design capacity of STPs were 151MGD, but only 55MGD was being treated and Sindh government, through KWSB, had taken initiative for upgrade of STP-I, STP-III and STP-IV so that the municipal wastewater could be treated while the Karachi Port Trust was also planning to install STP-V to treat wastewater and then discharge into the sea.

5,Call for smart steps to tackle growing food insecurity,"KARACHI: Highligh­ting concerns over triple burden of malnutrition in Pakistan, speakers at an international...","KARACHI: Highligh­ting concerns over triple burden of malnutrition in Pakistan, speakers at an international conference called for climate-smart interventions to tackle growing food insecurity and related challenges.
The second international conference —Nutrition and Sustainable Development — was organised by the human nutrition and dietetics department of Ziauddin University (ZU) in collaboration with the Nutrition Foundation of Pakistan.

They said it was still being debated as to how 6G would impact the world and that research should be focused to offer solutions to the issues of general nature in routine life of people. 
They were speaking at a three-day ‘International Multi Topic ICT Conference 2023’ that began in Mehran University of Engineering and Technology (MUET) Jamshoro in collaboration with Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology Karachi on Wednesday. 
Addressing the event, Sindh Higher Education Commissioner (SHEC) Chairman Tariq Rafi said: “We have to prepare our future generation for the rapidly changing world.” Technology had brought about changes in 20 years which were unseen in the last 200 years, he added, emphasising the need for bridging the gulf between different higher education institutions and research bodies. 
He said the use of AI had led to great help in the field of medicines. He said that 47pc population in the country was using internet and the world was changing rapidly, therefore, “we would have to prepare our future generation to face this”. 
He said the conference had provided opportunity to students to understand knowledge and have learning, adding that the event would help spread and transfer knowledge. He, however, observed that usually the research that was taking place on a daily basis did not take into account the routine life and issues of people. 
He said that research must provide guidance in that regard and scholars should link their research with those issues of people in their routine life so that solutions could be found. 
He said culture of shared working would have to be promoted because no individual or department could get success alone. In that regard, he underscored the need for bridging the gulf between different higher education institutions and research bodies. 
Addressing the inaugural session of the conference, Prof Dr Tauha Hussain Ali said today the world was talking about 6G service, admitting that there was a great difference in the thinking of the professors of national varsities and those of the developed world. 
“We are still three to four centuries behind the developed world. Our professors mostly conduct research for individual development which increases their own research papers, but it doesn’t benefit society,” Tauha conceded. He called for research that generally benefitted people. He said people took pride in working with international researchers and did not attach importance to working with national institutions. 
Prof Marja Matinmikko Blue of University of Oulu, Finland, said that 6G would impact the world and change its ecosystem. He remarked that sustainable development and 6G were two important questions concerning the world. 
He stated that cellular companies’ role would be crucial in the changes to be introduced by 6G. He further said that seven indicators and symptoms of sustainable development goals (SDGs) directly pertained to information communication technology. Those questions were still under discussion as to how 6G would affect world. 
A teacher of Spain’s university, 
Enrique Nava Baro discussed 3D digital image processing. Prof Dr Waliuddin of Sir Syed university, Dr Bhawani Shankar Chaudhry and Dr Umair Korai also spoke.

8,‘Lahooti festival helps reclaim indigenous culture’,"HYDERABAD: A galaxy of literati, scholars and folk artists joined the 10th year celebration of ‘Lahooti Melo...","HYDERABAD: A galaxy of literati, scholars and folk artists joined the 10th year celebration of ‘Lahooti Melo 2023’ on the lawns of the local press clubs and highlighted the importance of the annual event.  
The two-day festival ended here the other day. 
Speakers told the audience that Lahooti Melo not only promoted diversity but also helped reclaim the true indigenous culture, Sindhi literature and folk and mystic music of decades-old legacy of this region. They shed light on how the festival has been a success story for people. 
The festival’s inaugural session was marked by presence of eminent figures like writer Jami Chandio and journalist Wusatullah Khan, bes­ides DIG Pir Moha­mmad Shah, Thar’s celebrated folk singer Mai Dhaee, water expert Dr Hassan Abbas and others. 
The session was moderated by Lahooti’s founder Saif Samejo. 
Jami Chandio described Lahooti festival’s 10-year journey as a phenomenal success story which started at a time when country was hit by extremism. He said the festival helped mobilise youth and produced quality music while linking it with virtues and values. Lahooti created space for social analyses and enlightened discourse. He observed that Lahooti has given a ray of hope in this suffocating environment coupled with bad governance in the country. The festival has emerged as a unique opportunity blended with music and values, he observed. 
Elderly Mai Dhaee presented her famous folksong and barely uttered a few words in her Dhatki language, wishing success to festival’s organisers and saying that all of them were humble souls.  
Faqir Zulfikar performed on ‘dorindo’ an earthen musical object that is used like a flute.  
Bhagat Bhoro Lal – who was also discovered by Lahooti in the last one decade attributed his popularity to Lahooti. “We used to perform at shrines and then came to Lahooti that shot us to prominence,” he acknowledged smilingly. 
A musician from US, Mr Victorian said that his concept about Pakistan changed when he visited the country. He said he loved interaction here and found many things about Pakistan’s uni­que poetry, especially of this region. “We live to tell stories and it is an honour to be here,” he said. 
The country head of a German organisation that supports Lah­ooti festival, Ms Birgit Lamm, said that she found diversity in this show and had fallen in love with. “There are colourful people in Lahooti; such events offer an oppo­rtunity to understand each other,” she said.  
Eminent water expert Dr Hassan Abbas called for synchronising Pak­istan’s development model with culture of Indus river and give up all those things that are conflict with it. “We need to synchronise our development model with this groundwater. Our river is telling us something different whereas our incomplete development model is taking us to elsewhere,” he said.  
Sindh Language Authority (SLA) chairman Dr Ishaq Samejo praised Lahooti for mainstream indigenous music and Indus civilisation. He said that this festival also promoted Sindhi language. 
In memory of Ajmal Sawand 
Moderator Saif Samejo did not miss the opportunity to remember the young scholar, Prof Dr Ajmal Sawand, murdered in cold blood in upper Sindh Kandhkot district in an old enmity between his community and the Sundrani clan.  
Samejo opened a discussion at the session with Ajmal Sawand’s elder brother Dr Tariq Sawand, who narrating how his younger brother was killed by over half a dozen armed men when he was coming to Sukkur after visiting his community fellows in Kandhkot. 
“He was a humble soul and sufi, and was among those four persons in Pakistan who got a doctorate degree in artificial intelligence. It pains whenever I share his story,” Dr Tariq said.  
Senior journalist Wus­atullah Khan recalled Ajmal by reading his  column on Sawand Usko marna hi tha amidst applause.  
Ani Choying Drolma, a visiting Nepalese musician and rights activist, like Wusatulalh Khan, presented a sad song in Nepalese to express her sentiments on the murder of Sawand. She translated the song into English. As the poetry goes: ‘Tell me why did you needlessly take life — life which can’t be your’s’.  
DIG Pir Mohammad Shah, who hails from upper Sindh, said. Unless state enforced its writ, things would remain unresolved, he added. “You can’t treat cancer with a disprins. And when justice is delayed people lost trust in system and they either take law into their hands or turn to jirga systems. So, we as a society not only have to condemn it, but resist it as well,” he said.

9,Police break up PTI protests as tense calm prevails in Karachi,"Sindh govt bans rallies, sit-ins across province.","• Women among over 300 workers baton-charged, held
• Sindh govt bans rallies, sit-ins across province
• Green Line, Red Bus services suspended
• Internet shutdown fuels rumours
• Most educational institutions remained closed
• PTI claims ‘miscreants’ penetrated into peaceful protests
KARACHI: Amid a large number of arrests of workers of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf during and after clashes with police at different places in the city, raids on party leaders’ houses and closedown of government transportation services and internet, an uneasy calm prevailed in most parts of Karachi on Wednesday.  
Intermittent clashes between police and PTI workers and supporters were witnessed at a couple of points after a call for protest against the arrest of PTI chairman Imran Khan was given by the party leadership.  
Transport remained thin on city roads amid closure of several private educational institutions due to ‘precautionary measures’. 
The sense of anxiety and confusion that prevailed on Tuesday got further  deepened on Wednesday as the suspension of internet services, ban on  social media platforms and interruption in cellular services continued  to fuel speculations and spread disinformation about the overall  prevailing situation in the country.  
In a violent incident on Abul Hasan Isphahani Road on Wednesday evening, a police mobile was torched during a protest.  
Gulshan SP Zafar Siddique Chaanga told Dawn that a DSP Legal was travelling in the mobile van when miscreants intercepted it and set it on fire while the police officer remained unhurt. He said police rushed to the spot and arrested ‘some suspects’.  
In a late-night development, the PTI in a statement said they were staging only peaceful protests but some ‘miscreants’ had penetrated into their demonstrations and those miscreants had set fire to public and private property. The party alleged that the Sindh government was using ‘brutal force’ to crush peaceful demonstrators.  
The day began with the call of protests from the PTI at two different locations in the city and a pre-emptive move from the Sindh government to impose a ban on public gatherings under Section 144 of the CrPC across the province to ‘contain violence and illegal activities’.  
Despite the government move, PTI workers, including women, reached at the two designated places — Sharea Faisal and Millennium Mall intersection on Rashid Minhas Road — to register their protest.  
However, heavy contingents of law-enforcement agencies were already present there.  
As the PTI supporters, mostly women, started marching on Stadium Road amid suspension of traffic, the police resorted to baton charge and fired teargas shells.  
A number of women were dragged and taken into custody.  
Describing the police action as a ‘barbaric act’, PTI leader Firdous Shamim Naqvi alleged that the Karachi police were using ‘brutal force’ against women and unarmed people only because they were exercising their democratic right of protest.  
“We haven’t witnessed such a barbarism even in military rule,” he said while surrounded by PTI workers.  
“The police have arrested several female workers, including the elderly one. They are crossing every line to appease their masters, but they have forgotten their rule is not here to stay forever. The people of Pakistan are rising against injustice and aggression.” 
Surprisingly no other PTI leader showed up at any of the two protest sites.  
There wasn’t even a word from the party about the absence of its leaders.  
Workers’ arrest 
The police, on the other hand, claimed to have arrested 23 PTI ‘workers’ calling them ‘miscreants’ from Sharea Faisal and Millennium Mall for ‘creating law and order situation’ despite imposition of Section 144 on Wednesday.  
“We have arrested 23 miscreants — 12 from Insaf House on Sharea Faisal and 11 at Millennium Mall,” said Gulshan SP Zafar Siddique Chaanga accusing them of attacking law enforcers and damaging public property.  
He said the protesters left the Millennium Mall intersection and dispersed in narrow streets of neighbouring areas.  
With the fresh 23 arrests, the number of PTI workers taken into police custody has reached 300.  
Earlier, briefing Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, the Karachi police chief Javed Alam Odho claimed that as many as 270 ‘miscreants’ were arrested in Karachi during protests and violence on Tuesday.  
“Three suspects, who damaged a bus of People’s Bus Service, have also been identified and apprehended,” said an official statement.  
The process of identification and arrests of suspects who damaged public and private property is underway with the help of CCTV footages. The CM has directed the city police chief to register FIR against the people arrested as he wants every suspect behind the bars who have damaged the public and private properties, the official statement added. 
The government has strengthened the police force and additional 1,500 personnel have been deployed in Karachi to maintain law and order.  
The Sindh IG Ghulam Nabi Memon took an aerial view of the areas affected by the Tuesday’s violence and ordered the fresh deployment.  
A statement issued by the Central Police Office said 1,500 policemen had been deployed in Karachi.  
Police raids
The police also carried out raids on houses of senior PTI leaders, but returned empty handed in every attempt. The PTI spokesman said that heavy contingent of police raided the houses of Leader of the Opposition in Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Shiekh, Karachi chapter president Aftab Siddiqi, former Sindh governor Imran Ismail and PTI leader Khurram Sher Zaman.  
In a tweet, Mr Ismail claimed that even his mother’s home was raided where in his absence the police took away his younger brother.  
He alleged that the police had detained his driver in a raid on his home where he wasn’t present. 
City life
Meanwhile, the PTI call for shutdown on Wednesday appeared to have failed to draw any overwhelming response from Karachiites as daily life activities continued in most parts of the metropolis.  
However the number of vehicles on roads remained thin and several routes of government transport services, including Green Line and Orange Line BRTs were suspended on Wednesday.  
Despite announcement by the private schools to keep all institutions open, a large number of educational institutions remained closed as a “precautionary measures” due to uncertainty in the city.  
A leader of Karachi Tajir Ittehad on condition of anonymity said that the strike call by the PTI didn’t affect the business to a large extent.  
“There are a few commercial areas like market of car showrooms on New M. A. Jinnah Road, a business centre on Tariq Road and a few other places remained closed today [Wednesday],” he said.  
“Majority of centres which were open had failed to do regular business due to slim number of customers. Many vehicle and transport services were close which also kept people away from regular business.”

Some of the artworks displayed at the exhibition.—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

 
KARACHI: In William Shakespeare’s play Hamlet, there are seven soliloquies that the bard makes Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark, speak in order to apprise the audience/reader of the character’s innermost feelings — including the famous ‘to be or not to be’ speech. It’s an old technique used when the character is alone on stage, expressing himself / herself out loud. The fundamental difference between a monologue and a soliloquy is that the monologue has fellow (listening) character or characters around the speaker. Soliloquy is a solitary exercise. 
A two-person show that is concluded at the Full Circle Gallery on May 8 is titled Khud Kalami and has been translated as ‘soliloquy’. 
The gallery explains the idea in the following simple line: “Every single piece is a visual representation of the mysterious and secretive conversation we make with the multiple characters within ourselves.” 



 
That’s an interesting thought which reminds one of a verse by Urdu poet Nida Fazli: 
Har aadmi mein hotay hain das bees aadmi 
Jis ko bhi dekhna ho kai baar dekhna 
[Every man contains scores of men within 
Be watchful when you interact with him] 
The two participating artists — Muntehaa Azad and Amir Taj — have done justice to this idea to the hilt. Their artworks are a poignant study of the myriads of emotions and feelings that one human being feels or goes through in a particular time period. 
To boot, their craft (oil on canvas in Azad’s case and mixed media in Tatj’s) and the way they handle their drawing tools nicely commensurate with the thoughts they project. The combination creates striking scenes which compels the viewer to spend more time with each exhibit than s/he might not have anticipated. 
The ‘Abeyance’ series by Taj and paintings such as ‘Gulabi Aankhein’ by Azad are potent examples of the claim. If the former hints at societal web of emotional intricacies in which an individual finds himself ensnared, the latter explores individuality from an external perspective that raises the issue of identity. Both cases are highlighted in the form of interior monologues essential, at least in the initial stage, to make sense of life. And both artists, in the process, create art that not only catches the eye but stirs the soul.
