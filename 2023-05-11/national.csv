0,PTI leadership feels the heat as crackdown intensifies,Mazari describes IHC as fertile grounds for arrest of party leaders,"ISLAMABAD: With Imran Khan remanded to NAB custody, the state went after the PTI’s remaining senior leadership on Wednesday. PTI Secretary-General Asad Umar was picked up from outside the Islamabad High Court, while Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry was arrested outside the Supreme Court late on Wednesday night after holing up there for almost the entire day to avoid a police contingent waiting for him outside.
The former information minister had entered the premises of the apex court at 11am. He had sought relief from the courts the entire day after he learnt that orders for his arrest had been issued.
“I tried to contact the chief justice of the Islamabad High Court and the Supreme Court, but it seems that the courts do not open for us at midnight to give relief,” he said while speaking to media persons before his arrest.
Mr Chaudhry was asked to leave the apex court by security after the night staff left. He subsequently decided to hand himself over to police, remarking that it was unusual for a lawyer to be arrested in such manner.

Mazari describes IHC as fertile grounds for arrest of party leaders

“The government has divided the lawyers; that is why it has been successful in arresting me,” he said.
Earlier, Mr Chaudhry had said in a post on social media that a heavy contingent of Islamabad police was present outside the Supreme Court to arrest him in sheer violation of the IHC orders, which had earlier directed that he not be arrested in any case till May 12.
Mr Chaudhry had also taken a dig at the government, suggesting that since the army had been called in by the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments to maintain order, it may finally be time to implement the SC orders to hold elections on May 14. 
Qureshi refutes reports of arrest
Separately, PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Wednesday night refuted reports of his arrest, stating that various strategies were being adopted to spread misinformation and create chaos and terror in a bid to “break the spirit” of PTI workers and supporters.
In a statement, the PTI vice chairman said he had not been detained hitherto and all such reports were false and concocted. He warned the state, saying it had made a big mistake and that the Pakistani people would not sit in their homes anymore, as they no longer had any fear.
Earlier, Mr Qureshi had urged the people to continue protesting peacefully, saying their captain was in good health and more determined than ever “despite being detained and tortured”. He said Mr Khan had sent a message to his workers that they should not lose heart. He also urged the chief justice of Pakistan to take immediate notice of the army’s deployment. 
PTI Senior Vice President Dr Shireen Mazari on Wednesday came down hard on the government for the detention of Mr Umar, saying it seemed the IHC area had become a “fertile ground” for illegal arrests of PTI leaders. She said that since “they” could not get the terrorists, PTI leaders were now terrorists for the state.
Ms Mazari, too, complained that Mr Khan’s lawyers and the PTI’s senior leadership were not allowed to meet him in the makeshift NAB Court set up in the Police Lines Guest House.
“Many leaders and lawyers were not allowed inside premises. All signs of an­­other Kangaroo Court set up,” she added.
Ms Mazari concluded: “Cruel joke on the nation, as the corrupt go free but Imran Khan is victimised despite having never amassed wealth and having walked out of PM office with just his diary, which clearly depicts Pakistan is no place for honest leaders.”

1,Court acquits police officers in Model Town firing case,LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court on Wednesday acquitted former inspector general of police Mushtaq Ahmad Sukhera and...,"LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court on Wednesday acquitted former inspector general of police Mushtaq Ahmad Sukhera and three others in the 2014 Model Town firing incident.
Presiding Judge Ijaz Ahmad Buttar granted the acquittal applications filed under Section 265-K of the Cr.P.C by former IGP Sukhera, former DIG operations Rana Abdul Jabbar, former SP Model Town Tariq Aziz, and former town municipal officer (Nishtar Town) Ali Abbas.
Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) Secretary General, Khurram Nawaz Gandapur, the aggrieved party in the incident, has announced his intention to challenge the acquittal of the accused persons before the Lahore High Court. 
In a statement, he claimed that the trial court acquitted the guilty police officers without hearing the counsel of the victims’ families. He further stated that the court had been informed that the counsel would be out of the country until May 21.
However, Gandapur said, the court decided the acquittal applications of the accused persons in ex-parte proceedings.
Advocate Burhan Moazzam Malik, the counsel representing some of the police officers, told Dawn that the acquittal applications had been pending before the court for over a year, with frequent adjournments requested by the complainant’s lawyer or the PAT. 
Judge Buttar consistently postponed decisions on the acquittal applications during each hearing since 2022, due to the transfer application being pending before the LHC.
Advocate Malik primarily argued that the applicants/police officers did not face direct charges, as they were merely implicated in the case due to their presence at the crime scene. 
Sukhera was represented by Advocate Tayyab Jafri.
The judge adjourned hearing on the acquittal applications of former SP Omer Virk and others till May 19.
In this case, the court had acquitted Lahore Commis­sioner retired Capt Muhammad Usman last year by allowing his acquittal application.
Ten people were killed and around 100 injured during an ‘anti-encroachment’ operation outside the residence of PAT chief Dr Tahirul Qadri in Model Town on June 17, 2014.

2,Ruling coalition hits back at PTI after deadly unrest,"Fazl demands action against those who torched public, army property; Zardari says Imran should face courts instead of running away.","• Fazl demands action against those who torched public, army property
• Zardari says Imran should face courts instead of running away
• Dastgir insists PTI ‘more dangerous for Pakistan than India’
ISLAMABAD: The ruling coalition on Wednesday strongly condemned violent protests and the ransacking of public and private property by unruly mobs after the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan two days ago and vowed that no more aggression would be tolerated.
JUI-F emir Maulana Fazlur Re­­hman, who also heads the Pakistan Democratic Movement alliance, demanded the government take strict action against those who torched public properties, including those belonging to the military.
In a press conference in Islamabad, he said any institution that was trying to bring the PTI back to power would also be guilty and blamed Mr Khan’s government for not delivering a single development project in the past three and a half years.
PPP leader and former president Asif Ali Zardari said in a statement that after the arrest of Imran Khan, riots in the cities were regrettable and shameful.
He said he was in jail for 14 years but never allowed party workers to take the law into their hands. “The acts of harming public property and spreading chaos will not be tolerated,” he added.
The former president said the PTI chief had been arrested in a corruption case and should face the courts instead of running away.
Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb strongly condemned attacks on the building and offices of state-run Radio Pakistan and the Associated Press of Pakistan in Peshawar.
“The attack on the offices of Radio Pakistan and APP by PTI’s armed gangs was condemnable and deplorable,” she said in a message issued by her office.
The minister said that following the pattern of a similar attack on PTV headquarters in 2014 allegedly on Mr Khan’s instructions, PTI workers on Wednesday attacked Radio Pakistan and APP buildings.
She asked Radio Pakistan’s director general to file an FIR against miscreants, who she said tried to stop government broadcasting by cutting off lines, which was a serious crime.
Ms Aurangzeb said violence against government employees, vandalism and damage to property were “acts of terrorism”.
She also condemned the protesters for setting on fire the Chaghi Mountain Monument and Radio Auditorium. She said at least 15 notices had been sent to Imran Khan in the Al-Qadir Trust case, which was being investigated by the National Accountability Bureau.
The minister also accused PTI leaders of instigating arson and sabotage after Mr Khan’s arrest on Tuesday.
She said that a day after the unrest erupted, the PTI leadership on Wednesday claimed that party workers did not do violent protests. “When the PTI workers were damaging public and state property [on Tuesday], why didn’t the leadership stop them from doing so?” she said.
Meanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the constant contact and cooperation among the global states was a must to address pressing challenges faced by constitutional democracies.
“The rise of hybrid democracies, populism, nationalism, depleting level of truth, and rising migration is the existing threats to democracies,” he said.
Former senator Farahtullah Babar of the PPP said the constitutional democracies were facing challenges the world over, but these had been pronounced more in Pakistan.
Energy Minister Khurram Dastgir Khan dubbed the PTI as a fascist party and accused it of being involved in destructive activities since 2014, targeting both public and private properties. “The party was more dangerous for Pakistan than its arch-rival India,” he said at a press conference.
He said some 78 police officers had been injured in the violent protests since the PTI chief’s arrest.
The minister also mentioned the instances when protesters torched an ambulance in Peshawar and how some of them took out their wrath on the military, torching the residence of the corps commander in Lahore and gathering outside the entrance to the army’s general headquarters in Rawalpindi and pelting it with stones.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal alleged that the countrywide ransacking of public and private property was an outcome of a planned move of PTI.

3,Imran moves SC against his ‘unlawful’ arrest,Petition argues NAB warrant violates Article 10-A.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Wednesday approached the Supreme Court to set aside the warrants issued by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman on May 1 for his arrest and to challenge the Islamabad High Court decision against his plea for declaring the arrest ‘unlawful’.
The appeal, which was filed on behalf of Imran Khan through his counsel Raja Aamir Abbas, expressed apprehension about an imminent threat to the life and liberty of the petitioner.
It argued that the warrants appeared to be in violation of Article 10-A (a provision that guarantees right to fair trial), as the entire proceedings initiated by NAB and his subsequent arrest was intended to deprive the political party and its leadership of participating in and carrying out election campaign.
The petition contended that while the IHC held that by arresting the PTI chairman on the court premises on May 9, grave illegality had been committed, the court did not issue direction for his release from the ‘unlawful custody’. The court only issued contempt notices to interior secretary and Inspector General of Police, Islamabad, the petition pointed out.

Petition argues NAB warrant violates Article 10-A

While citing a 2009 judgement of the apex court, the petition argued the arrest made on court premises was illegal as the premises was the only sanctuary that citizens approach for redressal of their grievances and protection of their constitutional rights. Thus, it regretted, the entire proceedings initiated by NAB authorities and the arrest made thereunder in collusion with the present government, on the face of it was made with mala fide intention only to harass and damage the reputation of the petitioner.
The petition further argued the warrant issued by the NAB chairman under Section 24(i) of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 were “unlawful” also because warrants could only be issued during the investigation of a case or under Section 24(a)(i) when a suspect was intentionally or wilfully not joining the investigation after “repeated notices”. However, it claimed, not a single notice was issued to the petitioner after the inquiry against Mr Khan was turned into an investigation on April 28.
The appeal recalled Mr Khan in connection with his pre-arrest bail application was present inside the high court premises where the biometric procedure was being carried out when the Rangers personnel along with other officials broke in and shattered the windowpanes of the office to ‘unlawfully’ arrest the petitioner.
Subsequently, the matter was agitated before the IHC, which declined to declare the arrest ‘unlawful’, the petition recounted the events during and after the arrest.
The SC was further apprised that the issuance of warrants was unlawful since it was mandatory under Section 18(c) of the accountability ordinance that the inquiry report should be provided to the suspect before the commencement of the investigation in order to turn an inquiry into investigation. But no such report was ever prepared or handed over to Mr Khan, the petition said.
In his petition, Mr Khan claimed that the alleged amount of Rs190 million had already been deposited in the Supreme Court account apparently in relation to its May 4, 2018 judgement involving grant of 9,385-acre land by the Malir Development Authority to the Bahria Town Karachi in 2015 — about nine kilometres from Karachi toll plaza on the superhighway.

4,IHC bench in Tyrian White case dissolved,"Opinions of two judges uploaded on court website in violation of rules, says registrar","ISLAMABAD: While the Islamabad High Court (IHC) chief justice dissolved a three-member bench hearing the Tyrian White case before reconstituting it, opinions of two judges were uploaded on official website of the court on Wednesday in a move that the registrar office termed against rules when neither a judgement had been pronounced nor cause list issued for its announcement.
Shortly after removal of the 31-page opinion from the website as soon as news of a court ‘order’ in the case pertaining to the alleged daughter of PTI chairman Imran Khan flashed on TV screens, the IHC registrar office issued a clarification.
“Without the announcement of judgement or issuance of cause list for announcement or otherwise intimation to parties and their counsel and without the sign of third member (honourable chief justice), the opinion of two judges was uploaded alone with office notes, which does not constitute judgement of the court and is against the rules and the norms,” the registrar office explained.
The statement announced, “The honourable chief justice has reconstituted the bench for rehearing of the case”, adding that “action is also being taken against those responsible for uploading the opinion without issuance of cause list”. 

Opinions of two judges uploaded on court website in violation of rules, says registrar

Even court reporters were unaware of the sudden upload of the ‘decision’ of the two judges until Ahmed Pansota, the counsel for Mr Khan in the Tyrian White case, tweeted the case had been dismissed by a majority of 2 to 1. The reporters, who were present at the IHC, received frantic calls from newsrooms to ascertain the veracity of the development.
It emerged later that the ‘incomplete order’ had been uploaded on the IHC website and a few reporters also managed to download the 31-page ‘decision’ of Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir.
Sources privy to the development said the opinions were posted on website as soon as the chief justice had ordered reconstitution of the bench, after recusing himself from hearing the case. 
In his nomination papers and affidavits filed for elections, Mr Khan did not disclose that he had arranged for his alleged daughter Tyrian White’s upkeep in the UK, according to the petition moved by one Sajid Mehmood.
In a separate note released for the registrar, Justice Kayani explained the “judgement has been authored and finalised which was transmitted to Hon’ble Chief Justice, even a note in this regard has been sent on May 2, 2023 to my lord the Hon’ble Chief Justice with request to list the case for announcement on May 3, 2023, despite whereof, case has not yet been listed till date [May 09].”
In his opinion, the judge also stated, “Therefore any further delay in release of the judgement singed by two members of the bench who constitute a majority, could cause aspersion on the outcome of the case and impugn the confidentiality and integrity of the court process and public from the independence of the court.”

5,FAO introduces system for assessing acute food insecurity,DIEM information system currently active in more than 25 food-crisis countries,"ISLAMABAD: The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations has introduced a tool that made it easier for decision makers to assess the acute food insecurity of agricultural households and analyse its drivers when such shocks occur. 
The Data in Emergencies (DIEM) Information System, developed and funded by the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance of USAID, with contributions from the European Union and the Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA) of FAO, is currently active in more than 25 food-crisis countries and the DIEM-Monitoring system surveys about 150,000 households per year, representing more than 650 million people. 
One interesting example is Pakistan, where DIEM expertise facilitated a post-disaster damage and loss exercise for the whole agricultural sector after devastating floods in June-September last year. 
The results were then displayed on an interactive map on the DIEM hub, which breaks down overall damage and loss into sub-sectors (crops, livestock, fisheries) per province affected. 

DIEM information system currently active in more than 25 food-crisis countries

Another recent example of its use for FAO partners was in relation to the February earthquake that devastated large areas of Turkiye and Syria. Within days of the event, the DIEM team produced a preliminary analysis of cropland exposed to differing levels of earthquake intensity and displayed this as an interactive map with detail at both district and sub-district level. This kind of product is fundamental for the targeting of on-the-ground assessments and emergency assistance. 
Detailed, comprehensive and timely data is essential to address the impact of shocks such as droughts, earthquakes or conflict on agricultural production and livelihoods in parts of the world affected by food crises.
This is the first time that data focusing on agricultural livelihoods in food crisis contexts is being collected on this scale and frequency. The platform aims to support FAO members, United Nations’ agencies, the donor community and other stakeholders in informing decisions designed to trigger the appropriate anticipatory and response actions in support of agricultural livelihoods. 
The data is collected multiple times per year in the world’s most food-insecure countries — at household level through computer-assisted telephone inter-views and face-to-face surveys — and is published on the Hub rapidly thereafter. 
The data processing and analysis is completed in just three days, while the entire lifecycle — from data collection to validation and publication — takes just 30 days. 
Transparency and open data are key aspects of the project. Anyone can create a DIEM account to explore surveys, navigate dashboards, export maps and download data. This ensures that DIEM activities serve as public goods and that the humanitarian community, academics, media and all stakeholders can benefit from the large amount of data that is available to everyone.
The shocks analysed by DIEM comprise both natural and human-induced hazards. They include climate-related hazards, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, invasive pests, conflict and violence, as well as economic shocks.
In addition to regular food crisis monitoring, the DIEM platform also provides an integrated picture of the impact of large-scale hazards (severe shocks) on livelihoods and an estimate of the dollar value of damage and losses to the agriculture sector. This is achieved by combining remote sensing, secondary data review, household surveys, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and crowd-sourcing surveys.

7,Damage to public property won’t be allowed: Langove,Orders investigation into incidents of violence in front of Askari Park,"QUETTA: Balochistan Home and Tribal Affairs Minister Zia Langove has said holding peaceful protest is a democratic right of every citizen, but no one will be allowed to damage national assets and public property.
“All institutions are on alert for the safety of the country and the people, as law and order situation is under control in Balochistan,” the minister told the media on Wednesday, while deploring damage to government property and attack on officials the previous day.

Orders investigation into incidents of violence in front of Askari Park

He said the country could not afford anarchy and “we should wait for court decision”. “Harming your country, institutions and property and attacking officials is not service but anti-nationalism,” he added.
The minister said he ordered an investigation into the incidents of violence in front of Askari Park. Some suspicious men creating a law-and-order situation were spotted, he said, reiterating the warning that no one would be allowed to challenge the writ of the state under any circumstances.

8,ECP seeks report on ‘prohibited funding’ of political parties,ECP chief directs commission's scrutiny committee to furnish report within 15 days.,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan on Wednesday sought within 15 days a report on the prohibited funding allegedly received by political parties. 
Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja issued the directives to the ECP scrutiny committee while chairing a meeting. 
The scrutiny committee, initially formed back in 2019 to carry out scrutiny of the accounts and banking record of prohibited funding of the PTI, was later on tasked with conducting the same in relation to the documents of other political parties, including the PML-N and PPP. 
The ECP formed the committee after conducting numerous hearings of the PTI case, filed by the party’s founding member Akbar S. Babar. Based on the committee’s findings, the commission issued an order on Aug 2 last year, holding that the party had received funds from prohibited sources. 
In retaliation to the scrutiny of its records, the PTI lodged a complaint with the ECP, alleging irregularities and kickbacks in the funding of PML-N and PPP, as well as that of JUI-F. 
The Wednesday’s meeting of the commission also decided that polling for three National Assembly seats — NA-108 (Faisalabad), NA-118 (Nankana Sahib) and NA-239 (Korangi) — will be held on May 28. Taking notice of the irregularities in UC-119, Hyderabad, in the May 7 by-elections, the ECP has fixed May 15 for a hearing on the matter.
