BERLIN: When Bayer Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso takes on Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma in their Europa League semi-final first leg on Thursday, he will face not only his former mentor, but the man who predicted his future coaching success. 
Alonso played 151 games under Mourinho at Real Madrid from 2010 to 2013, winning several titles before the Portuguese returned to Chelsea. 
Mourinho tipped Alonso as a potential coach of the future in a 2019 interview to promote the Top Eleven video game and despite his predictions coming true, it is unlikely he forecast such a crucial meeting with his former protege would come around so soon. 
After retiring in 2017, Alonso took over as a youth coach at Real Madrid, before moving back to his home town to manage the Real Sociedad reserves. 
Since his appointment as Leverkusen manager in October, Alonso has lifted the side out of the relegation spots and into the European placings. 
In this time only Bayern Munich (47) and Borussia Dortmund (46) have managed to pick up more points than the 43 Leverkusen have. 
In Europe, Leverkusen’s elimination from the Champions League meant a shot at Europa League glory instead, with Alonso piloting the team past Monaco, Ferencvaros and Union Saint-Gilloise. 
The game is Leverkusen’s biggest match on the European stage since the 2002 Champions League final defeat by a Zinedine Zidane-inspired Real Madrid. 
Leverkusen’s 2-1 loss in Glasgow, along with their German Cup final defeat by Schalke 04 that year and finishing second by one point in the Bundesliga after blowing a four-point lead with three games to play, cemented the side’s ‘Neverkusen’ nickname. 
Leverkusen’s sparse trophy cabinet, boasting only the 1987-88 UEFA Cup and 1992-93 German Cup, is in stark contrast with Alonso’s rich haul of silverware. 
Alonso won Champions League titles with Liverpool and Real Madrid, along with league and cup titles in Germany, Spain and England. 
At international level, Alonso won two European Championships with Spain, as well as the 2010 World Cup. 
Almost a year after taking Roma to a Europa Conference League title in his first season in the Eternal City, Mourinho could rectify a slide in Serie A by winning a Europa League title. 
Winless in four, Roma have dropped from fourth to seventh and are now five points outside of the Champions League spots. 
Unlike Mourinho’s stuttering Roma, Alonso has Lever­kusen firing, with the German side going 14 games unbeaten before a surprise 2-1 home loss to derby rivals Cologne on Friday. Mourinho expressed admiration for Alonso, showering him with praise, at the pre-match news conference on Wednesday. “I haven’t seen him for a long time. Weve always had a fantastic rapport, more than between a coach and a player.” 
Mourinho said that the German team ranks among Europe’s finest in terms of executing counter-attacks. 
“They are very dangerous in this moment of the game, they defend, wait for the opponent to lose the ball and then its difficult to stop them,” he said, emphasising the number of swift attacking players in Alonso’s squad. “He uses the style that suits his players more, five or six ... of them could run the 100m with Marcel Jacobs at the Olympics.” 
Despite Roma reaching the semi-finals of a prominent European competition for the third consecutive season, Mourinho dismissed the notion that it puts pressure on the team. 
“We have enough experience not to be too excited for being in the semi-finals, and not to be too fixated on the fact that it is the first game and that it is played at home,” he said. 
JUVE TO FACE RECORD HOLDERS SEVILLA 
In the night’s other semi-final first leg, Roma’s Serie A rivals Juventus take on the competition’s record holders Sevilla; the Spanish club aiming to secure the title for an incredible seventh time. 
With the Serie A title race having ended with Napoli crowned champions, all that’s left to play for second-placed Juve is tying up a Champions League spot for next season and reaching the Europa League final. 
Coach Massimilano Allegri said on Wednesday that his side’s goal was to reach the final but remains wary of Sevilla’s pedigree. 
“Sevilla have won the Europa League four times and the UEFA Cup twice — they’ve got bags of experience and they never lie down, well need to put on a great performance,” Allegri told reporters. 
“Juventus have played in two European finals in recent years and we want to reach this one too. The three most important weeks all lie ahead of us now.” 
A few weeks ago, Sevilla were struggling to avoid relegation from La Liga, but the arrival of coach Jose Luis Mendilibar as replacement Jorge Sampaoli has given them new impetus at home and on the continental scene. 
Sevilla have lost just one of their last nine matches since Mendilibar took over as coach, ousting Manchester United in the quarter-finals during that run.

1,Argentina’s Etcheverry lines up Djokovic clash in Rome,ROME: Novak Djokovic will begin his bid to retain the Italian Open title against Tomas Etcheverry after the ...,"ROME: Novak Djokovic will begin his bid to retain the Italian Open title against Tomas Etcheverry after the Argentine beat Luca van Assche in the first round on Wednesday. 
World number 61 Etcheverry beat Frenchman Van Assche in straight sets, 7-6 (9-7), 6-3, in Rome to reach the second round, when the top seeds join the fray. 
Djokovic comes into the clay-court tournament he has won six times recovering from an elbow injury and set to lose top spot in the world rankings to young gun Carlos Alcaraz. 
Spaniard Alcaraz just needs to play a match in the Italian capital to become world number one ahead of the French Open which starts later this month. 
Djokovic won his record-equalling 22nd Grand Slam at the Australian Open in January but missed the American section of the hard-court swing in March. 
The 35-year-old has been unconvincing since the start of the European clay-court season, being eliminated in the last 16 at the Monte Carlo Masters, in the quarter-finals at Banja Luka and then pulling out of Madrid. 
Veteran Stan Wawrinka will face 25th seed Grigor Dimitrov in the last 64, the three-time Grand Slam winner easing past Ilya Ivashka 6-4, 6-2 following a rain delay. 
At age 38, Wawrinka is the oldest man in the tournament but he dominated Ivashka by hitting more than twice as many winners as his opponent, including one on his first match point to close it out in little more than an hour. 
“I was ready for it. I’m playing well. It was a good first match and I’m really happy to get through again,” Wawrinka said. “I have been working hard to get to this level. This year I’m playing much better, but I need to win more matches. That’s what I’m missing a bit, the confidence to win more matches. But in general the level is great.” 
Also, Marton Fucsovics defeated Filip Krajinovic 6-4, 6-2 and Sebastian Baez beat Juan Pablo Varillas 7-5, 6-3. 
STEPHENS CRUISES 
In the women’s tournament, former US Open champion Sloane Stephens beat Nadia Podoroska 6-4, 6-1 to open her Rome campaign in style following her triumph in Saint Malo last week. 
Up next for the American is two-time major champion Victoria Azarenka. 
Lesia Tsurenko overcame two-times champion Elina Svitolina 6-4, 6-3 in an all-Ukrainian clash, the latter having returned to the WTA tour at the Charleston Open last month following her maternity break. 
Colombia’s Camila Osorio battled from 5-2 down in the last set and saved three match points to defeat Varvara Gracheva 7-6 (7-4), 1-6, 7-6 (7-4), while Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova beat Sara Errani 6-1, 6-1 to set up a meeting with the top-ranked Iga Swiatek.

2,PCB mulling boycott if Asia Cup shifted to Sri Lanka: reports,"According to an ESPNCricinfo report, Sri Lanka Cricket and the Bangladesh Cricket Board have rejected the hybrid model.","KARACHI: While opposing the possible shifting of this year’s Asia Cup to Sri Lanka, Pakistan cricket officials are seriously mulling boycotting the regional tournament if their proposal is not accepted by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), Press Trust of India news agency reported on Tuesday night.
Pakistan Cricket Board’s Interim Committee chairman chief Najam Sethi during his meeting with ACC officials in Dubai on Tuesday objected to the move to relocate the Asia Cup — originally scheduled to be hosted by Pakistan in September this year — to Sri Lanka instead of having it in the UAE as part of the hybrid model proposed by the PCB due to India’s refusal to send its team to Pakistan for the continental event.
According to an ESPNCricinfo report on Wednesday, Sri Lanka Cricket and the Bangladesh Cricket Board had rejected the hybrid model.
“Sethi has stressed the ACC should accept Pakistan’s revised hybrid model proposal schedule for the Asia Cup and if at all the majority of members wish to have it elsewhere it must be held in the UAE like in 2018 and 2022,” the PTI quoted a “reliable PCB source” as saying.
“Sethi rubbished the concerns of the BCCI conveyed to the ACC that it would be too hot to play in the UAE in September by pointing out [on Tuesday] that the BCCI had held its Indian Premier League in the UAE in September to November in 2020.”
The source said the PCB was surprised to learn that the Sri Lankan board with back-door support from the BCCI had told the ACC it wants to host the Asia Cup this year.
“It came as a surprise because earlier at the last ACC board meeting in February, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan had rejected the Sri Lankan proposal and it was agreed Pakistan would remain the [Asia Cup] host,” the source observed.
Before leaving for Dubai, Sethi had told his officials to start working on having a tri-nation or four-nation event in Pakistan this year in the Asia Cup window if the continental event is not held in the country.
Another PTI report on Monday claimed the ACC had decided to move the Asia Cup out of Pakistan. Sri Lanka has emerged as a front-runner to host the six-nation tournament citing concerns over extremely humid conditions in the UAE.
The PCB was forced to propose an alternative after the BCCI refused to send the Indian team to Pakistan due to diplomatic tension between the two neighbouring nuclear-armed countries.
The PCB had proposed that India play their Asia Cup games in the UAE while Pakistan host the remaining matches of the continental event on home soil.
“Sethi was in Dubai today [Tuesday] to procure support but to his horror, there were no takers for his proposal of Pakistan playing its games in Karachi or Lahore and India playing in the UAE. Sri Lanka was always with the BCCI and now even the Bangladesh Cricket Board seemed opposed to the idea,” an ACC source told PTI.
“The ACC has always maintained that in principle the ‘hybrid model’ is unacceptable and the budgetary sanctions can never be passed.”
Also it’s not about Pakistan hosting its own matches. It also means that if India and Pakistan are in the same group, the third team will be travelling to and fro between Dubai and a host city in Pakistan.
“Also logistically, the broadcasters wouldn’t want to send separate units in two countries. Sri Lanka, just like the UAE, doesn’t require inter-city flights whether you play at the Khettarama [Premadasa Stadium], SSC or Galle or Kandy.”
However, the ACC chairman Jay Shah will need to convene an executive body meeting to make the decision official.
In the prevailing situation, whether Pakistan participates in the event or decides against coming to India for the World Cup remains to be seen. “Even the ICC won’t agree to Pakistan playing its matches outside India [during the World Cup]. So let’s see what the PCB decides,” the source added.

Two-time champions West Indies missed out on automatic qualification for the World Cup and will take part in a 10-team tournament, including UAE, with the top two going through to the main event in India later in the year.
“This is our first ever bilateral tour against the UAE... it will provide a good opportunity for our players to get some preparation ahead of the ICC Cricket World Cup qualifiers,” said Jimmy Adams, CWI’s director of cricket.
“It will also allow those players not going to Zimbabwe to get some valuable experience at the international level in foreign conditions, which would be hugely beneficial to their growth and development.”
The day-night matches will be played on June 5, 7 and 9. The World Cup qualifying competition begins on June 18.

4,"Cummins eyes playing until 35, wary of burnout",Next up for Cummins and Australia is the World Test Championship final against India in London next month.,"SYDNEY: Australia captain Pat Cummins wants to play international cricket for another five years but has already experienced one period of burnout which forced him to reassess the balance in his life.
The 30-year-old paceman played his first Test as a teenager in South Africa in 2011 but did not play his second until six years later as he was nursed through a series of injuries.
Once he did return to Australia’s colours, however, he quickly discovered the almost unrelenting demands on the top modern players. 
“Cricket’s basically 12 months of the year,” he told former England footballer Rio Ferdinand on the Get Real with Rio vodcast. “There’s always a cricket game going on somewhere, and I played non-stop for a year or two. This is about four or five years ago, I kind of just came back from injuries. 
“And I was just spent, like burnt out, and I just remember thinking, ‘Jeez, I’m 25 here but I want to do this until I’m 35. I’ve got to find a way to balance all these different things’.”  
Cummins’s last action came on Australia’s tour of India earlier this year, which he left early to return home to be with his terminally ill mother.
He said her death from breast cancer in March was still “pretty raw” but he was glad he had been able to spend time with her and his family at the end. 
“I think it hits home the kind of person you want to be, the kind of father you want to be. So from that side, it’s been quite good. Lots of memories,” he said. “But in terms of the grief I guess we’ll keep working through that.”  
Next up for Cummins and Australia is the World Test Championship final against India in London next month followed quickly by the five-Test Ashes series against England.

5,SA qualify for World Cup after Ireland-BD washout,LONDON: South Africa secured direct qualification on Tuesday for the 50-over Cricket World Cup in India later this...,"LONDON: South Africa secured direct qualification on Tuesday for the 50-over Cricket World Cup in India later this year after the first One-day International between Ireland and Bangladesh ended in a no-result washout.
Ireland had to win all three matches in a series against Bangladesh taking place at Chelmsford, the headquarters of English county Essex, if they were to move up from 11th place in the points table.
Even if Ireland now take the series 2-0, they cannot surpass South Africa in eighth place in the World Cup Super League (WCSL) standings.
Ireland will now have to compete in the June 18-July 9 qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe, that also includes former champions West Indies and Sri Lanka.
The Irish were 65-3 in the 17th over, chasing Bangladesh’s 246-9, made from a full 50 overs, when bad light and rain halted play at 4:34pm local time (1534 GMT).
A minimum of 20 overs had to be bowled in Ireland’s innings for a result to be declared under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method for rain-affected matches.
But the fixture was called off at 1800 GMT when the umpires deemed conditions too wet to restart play.
Josh Little — fresh from starring in the Indian Premier League — led Ireland’s attack with 3-61, with two wickets apiece for Graham Hume and Mark Adair as Bangladesh were restricted to a seemingly modest total on a good pitch.
Mushfiqur Rahim celebrated his 36th birthday by top-scoring for the Tigers with 61 in front of a crowd of some 3,000 at Chelmsford, mainly consisting of Bangladesh fans.
Najmul Hossain Shanto made 44.
Ireland, however, soon found themselves in trouble at 27-2 following the loss of experienced opener Paul Stirling and captain Andrew Balbirnie.
The series continues on Friday.
The first spots in the 10-team World Cup go to the top eight finishers of the WCSL, a competition that has run over the last three years.
Reigning champions England, India, New Zealand, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan have already guaranteed their places.

6,Boult still wants to play for New Zealand at World Cup,JAIPUR: Seamer Trent Boult still wants to play for New Zealand at this year’s World Cup and tests next year ...,"JAIPUR: Seamer Trent Boult still wants to play for New Zealand at this year’s World Cup and tests next year despite giving up his central contract to allow him to spend more time with his family.
The 33-year-old, who with Tim Southee has made up one of the world’s most feared pace attacks over the last decade, has not played international cricket since negotiating a  “significantly reduced role” with the Black Caps in August. 
“I’ve still got that big desire to play for New Zealand,” Boult told Cricinfo in Jaipur, where he is playing for the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League (IPL). “It is what it is: I’ve made my decision. I’ve been lucky enough to have a 13-year career in the Black Cap and hey, I’ve still got a big desire to play in the World Cup as well. 
“It’s such a great tournament ... one hundred percent, I’ve got that desire to be out there.”  
Boult was part of the squads that finished runners-up at the last two 50-overs World Cups and thought New Zealand would again be a force in India in October and November. 
“We’re a great one-day side,” he added. “We’ve got some players that have travelled to India and experienced the conditions a lot, and that’s what it comes down to in World Cups. 
“You can’t buy experience, and you can’t replace players that have toured for however many years across these conditions.”  
Boult was snubbed for New Zealand’s home Test series against England earlier this year, despite the hosts losing a string of fast bowlers to injury and the first test taking place close to his Mount Maunganui home. 
“It felt bizarre,” he said. “Test match cricket was on, a couple of kilometres down the road, and I wasn’t part of it.”  
The pace spearhead said he hoped he had not played his last match for New Zealand in the longest format. 
“There are some big Tests coming up next year. Australia and South Africa are due to travel to New Zealand. And Test cricket is still my favourite format,” he said. “They said that if I chose to move away from that contract, my time ... would be limited and I’m pretty sure they’ve never had anyone play Test cricket that isn’t contracted — so that probably makes it hard as well.”

7,"Haaland shackled by Real, but De Bruyne shows his class for City",The reigning champions also manage to shut down supply to Haaland and in Brazilian livewire Vini­cius Jr they had the best player on pitch.," 

MANCHESTER CITY’S Kevin De Bruyne celebrates after scoring the equaliser during the Champions League semi-final first leg against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.—Reuters

MADRID: For once Manchester City goal monster Erling Haaland was shackled, but when his side needed a moment of magic the old reliable Kevin De Bruyne conjured it against Real Madrid in an absorbing Champions League semi-final first leg on Tuesday.
The 31-year-old De Bru­yne, like the rest of City’s high-quality collection of internationals, has been outshone by Haaland’s record-shredding first season in England.
Norwegian powerhouse Haaland has netted 51 goals in all competitions but he found Real Madrid’s Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba a little less accommodating than the Premier League centre backs he has bullied mercilessly all season.
He was kept relatively quiet, with Alaba denying him with one sensational covering tackle, but De Bruyne popped up to make sure City emerged from the Bernabeu with a 1-1 draw.
With Real looking comfortable and threatening to add to the lead given to them by a Vinicius Jr wonder strike from distance in the 36th minute, De Bruyne showed again why he rema­ins so indispensable for City as they seek to finally win the Champions League and perhaps a treble.
His shot from outside the area was a thing of beauty, the ball rising no more than a foot off the turf as it streaked like a missile through the Madrid air and past Thibaut Courtois in 67th minute.
“Kevin is a massive player for us. Always he has been great and he helped us in the moment we most needed it,” City midfielder Rodri said of the Belgium talisman who has been a key component in four Premier League winning teams. “We were suffering a bit because they were keeping the ball and with the goal he gave us the confidence to keep pushing.”
De Bruyne’s 14th Cham­pions League goal for City means he is the first player in Champions League history to score in separate away games against Real in the knockout rounds.
It also swung the tie in favour of Pep Guardiola’s side who will be slight favourites in the second leg next Wednesday in the Etihad Stadium where they are unbeaten for five years in the competition.
They will have to be wa­ry, however, of a Real side who will also take a large amount of comfort from the first leg as they seek to win the trophy for a record-extending 15th time.

Despite ceding the lion’s share of possession to City, especially in the first half, they oozed serenity, never panicked, and looked razor-sharp on the counter-attack.
The reigning champions also managed to shut down the supply to Haaland and in Brazilian livewire Vini­cius Jr they had the best player on the pitch on Tuesday.
No wonder wily old manager Carlo Ancelotti did not look too perturbed at not winning the opening leg.
“We competed, we fought, I think we deserved to win,” the Italian, who has won the competition twice with Real and twice with AC Milan, told Movistar Plus.
“The result doesn’t reward us for what we did on the pitch, but this tie will be close until the last minute. We have to play like this again next week. Our strategy was good, we weren’t worried when they had possession. Then the second half was completely different. We are left with good sensations.”
Ancelotti is usually calm and composed on the touchline but he lost his temper after City’s goal and was shown a yellow card for bitterly complaining with Portuguese referee Artur Dias. The Italian felt the ball went out of play in the buildup to City’s equaliser.
“The referee was too distracted,” Ancelotti told a press conference. “In the previous play it was a corner for us that he didn’t see. And the ball was out of play, the technology in the images shown by BeIN Sports shows that clearly.
“It’s strange that they didn’t see it. He gave me a yellow card, and I wasn’t even playing. Some of the players in the pitch dese­rved more cards. The referee wasn’t very attentive.”
Guardiola was happy with what he saw, although said some tweaks might be needed.
“Tight game, Bernabeu, a semi-final always is difficult. 1-1 and we have a final next Wednesday at home with our people,” he said. “Now it’s like a playoff. We can defend better in some departments, maybe we can attack a little differently. Alaba and Rudiger were so close to Erling, so there were very few spaces. Maybe we can adjust a couple of things.”
Under Guardiola City have dominated English football. They are on the brink of a fifth Premier League title in six seasons.
But they are yet to replicate that success on the European stage. In contrast to Real’s wealth of experience, City have only reac­hed the Cha­mpions League final once in their history.
City suffered heartache against Real at the same stage of the competition last season as a late collapse in the second leg at the Bernabeu saw the Spanish giants go on to win the competition for the 14th time.
But home advantage for the return leg could make the difference this year with winger Jack Grealish saying City were confident of finishing the job at home, where they are unbeaten at home since November.
“At the Etihad at the moment we feel unstoppable,” Grealish told BT Sport. “We came here tonight to try and win, but I think it shows our character to go a goal down and come back. In the end, it was a fair result.”
Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said the second leg will be like a “final” for the Spanish side. “Next week will be like a final, and we are quite good at winning finals,” Courtois said. “Hopefully we can mentalise it like that even though it is at City and it will be tough for us.”

Though Pakistan had also grabbed top position in the Open Team event on Sunday before losing it on Monday, they regained top spot on Wednesday to qualify for the last four with 164.34 victory points.
Being leaders, Pakistan could pick their semi-final rivals and they decided to face the UAE on Thursday. India take on Bangladesh in the other semi-final.
In the last round-robin match, Pakistan edged India by gaining 10.61 VPs against 9.39 scored by the latter. This win put Pakistan (164.34) just ahead of India (163.41).
Bangladesh (143.77) came third and the UAE (140.65) fourth while bottom-placed Jordan (137.83) were ousted from the contest.
In the Senior Team contest comprising three teams, Pakistan outclassed India by securing 17.59 VPs, to India’s 2.4, to accumulate 180.91 to emerge victorious. India (179.68) came second while Jordan (85.91) struggled to finish third.
After the last round of this category to be held on Thursday, two top teams, most likely India and Pakistan, directly play the final.
In the Women’s section, Pakistan upstaged India by earning 10.31 points to their rivals’ 9.69. But after finishing as leaders, India decided to face Palestine in the semi-final on Thursday.
India led points table with 206.36 VPs, Pakistan (170.79) remained second, followed by the UAE (151.59) and Palestine (128.64) as Jordan failed to qualify for the last-four stage. Pakistan play the UAE in the other semi-final.
Meanwhile, Pakistan failed to do well in the Mixed Team event losing to the UAE 15.74-4.26 to finish at the bottom with an aggregate of 117.47.
India (192.38) led in this category, the UAE (156.13) stood second while Jordan (133.52) finished third.

In turn, at stumps, Pakistan Shaheens were 115-1 in 24 overs and were trailing by 48 runs with nine wickets in hand. Captain Imran Butt returned to the pavilion after adding 63 runs for the opening wicket with Mohammad Huraira (60 not out) before the latter and Omair Bin Yousuf returned undefeated as they added an unbroken 52 runs for the second wicket. 
Earlier, after being put into bat, Zimbabwe A lost Joylord Gumbie for seven to Ali with 12 runs on the board. After the departure of Gumbie, opening batter Tadiwanashe Marumani was joined by Dion Myers and the pair knitted 110 runs for the second wicket. 
Myers (50 off 108), after scoring his fifth first-class half-century, was next to return back to the hut. He was bowled by left-arm spinner Mehran Mumtaz.
At the score of 130, Marumani (66 off 100) was caught by wicket-keeper Haseebullah off Aamir, both playing their first match on the tour.
Following the departure of two set batters, Zimbabwe A were unable to recover and the pace bowling duo of Aamir and Ali were all over the opposition, bowling them out for 163 in 56.4 overs.
Ali returned with figures of 4-36 in 14.4 overs, while Aamir and Mehran snapped three wickets each.
Scores in brief:

“The moment has arrived to announce this is my last season at Barcelona,” said Busquets on Instagram. “It has been an unforgettable journey.”
The former Spain international served as the club captain for the last two seasons, having become an integral part of the team over the years.
He helped Barcelona win eight La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, three Champions League trophies and three Club World Cups.
“It has been an honour and a source of pride to have been able to wear this badge but everything must come to an end,” continued Busquets.
“Although it has not been an easy decision, I think the time has  come.” 
Busquets, who retired from international duty last year, has made more than 700 appearances for Barcelona and holds the record for playing in more El Clasicos than any other player with 48 appearances against Barcelona’s rivals Real Madrid.
Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez, who played with Busquets in the  team’s midfield for several years, wanted the midfielder to stay next  season, but said the decision was up to him.
Busquets’ team-mates past and present paid tribute to him on social media after he announced his future lay outside the club.
“My  friend, after so much we’ve lived through together, what can I say that  you don’t know?” wrote Barcelona defender Jordi Alba on Instagram.
“You’re leaving your home, having made an indelible imprint on Barcelona’s history.
“More  than 700 games and a fundamental part of so many titles, and glorious  nights that all Barca fans will forever remember.”
Former Barcelona  playmaker Andres Iniesta said Busquets was  “number one”.A report on Spanish TV show El Chiringuito de Jugones said that Busquets has accepted an offer by Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hilal along with Lionel Messi. Messi’s father has said the Argentine has not  “signed or agreed” a deal.

12,Groves wins chaotic Giro stage 5 after dog causes Evenepoel crash,"SALERNO: Favourite Remco Evenepoel crashed twice on stage five of the Giro d’Italia on Wednesday, the first time...","SALERNO: Favourite Remco Evenepoel crashed twice on stage five of the Giro d’Italia on Wednesday, the first time after a dog strayed on to the road in treacherous conditions caused by driving rain, before Kaden  Groves won the stage in a bunch sprint.
The riders spent the majority of the 171km route from Atripalda to Salerno in the rain and they had to go cautiously on the descents, but chaos ensued when two big crashes ahead of the final sprint split the bunch.
The first took place seven km from the end, with Groves among those to fall on a bend and the second occurred with less than two km left when Evenepoel was brought down again along with many riders.
Andreas Leknessund avoided both crashes and retained the leader’s maglia rosa jersey with a 28-second lead over Evenepoel.
The second crash did not affect Evenepoel’s time as it happened inside the three-km mark, effectively neutralising the general classification times.
But the crash left the Belgian world champion fuming while the rest of the bunch surged ahead and AlpecinDeceuninck’s Groves dominated the sprint to win the stage.
“I surprised myself today. Everything was going well but then I crashed at the roundabout with seven kilometres to go,” the Australian said.
“Luckily, I put my chain back on fast enough and the group came back together. The guys did a good job earlier and then luckily I was good enough to be in position and had the legs to lead out and win.
Stage two winner Jonathan Milan and Mads Pedersen were in hot pursuit but finished second and third respectively, while Mark Cavendish and David Dekker crashed on the finish line.
Earlier, Evenepoel hit the deck after a dog ran on to the wet road, taking him down as well as SoudalQuick-Step team-mate Davide Ballerini, who slid several metres on the tarmac.
But Evenepoel, wearing his rainbow jersey after losing the maglia rosa on Tuesday, was back on the saddle again two minutes later before catching up with the bunch.
After two climbs, the route flattened out with 30km to go. The breakaway trio of Thomas Champion, Samuele Zoccarato and Stefano Gandin had built up a head of steam before they were absorbed by the peloton with seven km to go.
That was when the first major crash split the bunch and prevented some sprinters from moving up for the final attack, including Movistar’s Fernando Gaviria and UAE Team Emirates’ Pascal Ackermann.
As the teams scrambled to bring their lead-up riders to the front with less than two km to go, another crash brought Evenepoel down and the rest of the bunch went ahead for the sprint.
Cavendish found himself jostling for position before he fell on the line, taking out Andrea Vendrame who was carried away on a stretcher.
Primoz Roglic, another pre-race favourite, also crashed and suffered a cut leg.
