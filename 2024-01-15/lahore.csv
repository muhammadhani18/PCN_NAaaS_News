0,Will the election be held on Feb 8?,"‘CJ should have stayed from the PTI’s case’; political uncertainty, terrorism, Baloch protest discussed at ThinkFest","LAHORE: As the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) faced a setback after the decision of the Supreme Court and there is still uncertainty about the upcoming election, a session at the Afkar-e-Taza ThinkFest discussed the political situation in the country on Sunday.
The session, titled Facing the popular will: Election 2024, had veteran politician Afrasiab Khattak, journalist Hamid Mir and caretaker minister for information and broadcasting Murtaza Solangi as panelists while it was moderated by Tamkinet Karim.
To the question whether the election will be held on Feb 8, Khattak said there was uncertainty about it and one should see the elephant in the room. He added the army generals who were ruling the country didn’t want any election or they wanted to prolong the process at least.
Hamid Mir agreed with Khattak, saying the powerful circles wanted to delay the election on the lame excuse of the law and order situation.
“They want ‘somebody’ to be completely disqualified before the election so that he might not get any relief. However, after yesterday’s decision of Qazi Sahib (Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa), they (powerful circles) would review their earlier opinion and there is less chance now of the election being delayed”. He was referring to the ban on the bat as the election symbol of the PTI.

‘CJ should have stayed from the PTI’s case’; political uncertainty, terrorism, Baloch protest discussed at ThinkFest

Mir predicted that if election would be held on Feb 8, the government would be formed as per the desire of the powers that be and that government would be pushed to enter an agreement like the “Tashkent agreement,” which would be opposed by the masses as well as all political parties, resulting in a movement against the government (and its dissolution).
Solangi said the polls would certainly be held and it had been his consistent opinion since the formation of the caretaker government.
Regarding the SC decision, Khattak said the decision was a political one but it had been given legal cover.
Tamkinet said the election should be free and fair as well. She asked which party had got the level-playing field at the moment while there were also killing fields in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. To this, Khattak reminded the audience that only the 1970 general election was fair which was not accepted by the army generals because Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s party had won it. After that Gen Zia had taken the stance that the election should be held only when positive results would be certain and since then the same policy was being followed.
Regarding the level-playing field, he said no party had it as all the parties were trying to get the vote of the GHQ instead of the masses.
Mir said the SC decision had exposed the party that had got the ‘level-playing field’ and that party whose leadership was in Lahore had got the privilege. He added that for a similar breach of election rules (intra-party election), the ANP was fined just Rs20,000 while it was allowed to run the election on its symbol of Laltain.
Mir said CJ Qazi Faez Isa should have stayed away from the case as a reference was filed against him during the PTI government. He said the PML-N and Justice Isa were on the same page while adding that Faisal Vawda had declared Isa’s verdict one month ago.
When Solangi termed the SC decision “very good”, he was booed by the audience and elicited laughter when he said a legal precedent had been set to force the parties to ensure intra-party election.
Hamid Mir said if the polling turnout went above 50pc or reached 60pc, the results would subvert the plans of the establishment. He said there was resistance in Punjab also now while earlier it was only in Balochistan or Sindh or KP.
Regarding terrorism and law and order situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Khattak said terrorism was not spontaneous and it was only state agencies tactics of political engineering and they themselves claimed that the Taliban were not a danger but only Pashtun and Baloch nationalists.
“Terrorism is a new way of political engineering. For example, Mohsin Dawar’s car has been attacked because he talks of democracy and national and political rights.”
When asked by Tamkinet
that Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s party was also being attacked by terrorists, Khattak said Fazl’s part was being attacked only in Bajaur because Daesh had its centre in the neighbourhood of Bajaur. “Daesh attacks Fazl because it thinks that he supports the Taliban and Daesh is against them.”
Regarding Balochistan, Khattak said there was a democratic progressive movement in Balochistan but BAP (Balochistan Awami Party) had been formed there. He said Senate was supposed to be the house of federation but it had been turned into ‘the house of conspiracies’. When I was the chairperson of the human rights committee from 2009 to 2015, there were complaints of disappearances and we found out that ISI played a major role in disappearances. The committee decided to make a law in this regard but the agencies decided to control the Senate and the Sanjrani formula was introduced to stop the passage of such laws.
To a question, Hamid Mir said the Baloch women protesters were badly treated and arrested in Islamabad and the government tried to “deport” them from the federal capital like illegal immigrants. However, the local population supported them as against the state institutions. Saying that Baloch women protesters were heart-broken, he added that women in Balochistan were more radicalised compared to their men.
“I don’t see as much hatred among the Bengalis when I go there as I see in Baloch people,” he revealed.
Khattak narrated an incident that he was a part of the commission formed by Justice Athar Minallah to look into grievances of Baloch students. “When we visited the Balochistan University there were few students in the hall to attend the session but surprisingly after sometime thousands of students appeared.” He said a senator from Quetta told him that Baloch girls and boys did not want to attend the Pakistan national anthem at the start of the event. “I saw what I had seen in Dhaka University in 1971,” Khattak said, terming the forced disappearances state terrorism.

1,50pc of under-treatment children test positive for pneumonia,The caretaker Punjab government has established a six-member body of senior medical experts to control the high prevalence of pneumonia in children.,"LAHORE: Up to 50 per cent of samples from under-treatment children sent by the University of Child Health Sciences (UCHS) of Lahore to the National Institute of Health (NIH) of Islamabad tested positive for viral pneumonia, indicating a high prevalence of the disease in Punjab.
In the reports, it has been diagnosed that the kids brought to Lahore Children Hospital for treatment with chest infections were suffering from acute respiratory tract infection (ARI), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza — the infections that led to severe pneumonia complications, often fatal.
The ARI is a respiratory tract disease evolving in fewer than 15 days, often turning into pneumonia, while the RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Infants and older adults are more likely to develop severe RSV and need hospitalization.
A senior official of Children Hospital of Lahore told Dawn that the reports released recently by the NIH confirmed the health and lives of a large number of children were at greater risk, particularly in the prevailing cold weather in Lahore and the rest of the province due to the severity of the viral infection.
The issue came to the limelight when caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi, during his visit to Children Hospital a week ago, found out eight out of 10 children in its emergency were suffering from pneumonia.
Most children under five years were brought with severe chest complications, and pneumonia has been the leading cause of death among children in Pakistan and globally.
In the related development, the caretaker Punjab government, three days ago, established a six-member body of senior medical experts to control the high prevalence of pneumonia in children, following the pattern of the dengue experts advisory group.
The health department has notified the ‘Pneumonia Experts Advisory Group’ on January 12 with the prime objective of regularly reviewing the data related to pediatric patients suffering from pneumonia/viral bacteria ARI.
According to the terms of references, the body will review the trends for infectivity and mortality for such diseases and furnish an advisory according to the disease trends regarding prevention and control of the disease to the competent authority for necessary action.
UCHS Vice-Chancellor (VC) Prof Dr Masood Sadiq confirmed to Dawn that the pneumonia burden on children under five was estimated to be 40 to 50 percent in the reports issued by NIH.
“We had dispatched samples of 30 children brought with chest infections at Children Hospital Lahore,” Dr Sadiq said. He said that all the kids were under five years old, and NIH reports suggested that many of them were suffering from RSV, influenza virus, a common cause of pneumonia, and human para-influenza viruses, a group of infections commonly causing lower and upper respiratory illnesses in infants.
“If we further segregate the cases, infants under one year old are more vulnerable to pneumonia,” the VC said. The reasons were that most of them have been either unvaccinated or not on mother feed, he said. Similarly, he said, the children who were presented with co-morbidity were also largely exposed to the viral infection.
Prof Sadiq said that Lahore Children Hospital had also sent samples of 50 children in mid-2023 to the NIH of Islamabad, with nearly 40-50 per cent of them suffering from the same viral infection mentioned above. He said that the NIH of Islamabad was engaged for diagnosing this particular viral infection because the testing facility in question was not available in any institute in Punjab, including Lahore Children Hospital.

The case was registered against the HBL branch manager, cashier, and an HBL franchise connect-branch owner.
Principal Farida Kareem, the complainant, stated in her FIR registered under sections 420, 468, and 471 of the Pakistan Penal Code that the amount intended for the annual examination fees of 249 BA students was deposited on various dates in April 2023. 
However, their results were not declared because the fees were not transferred to the university. Instead,
the staff provided fake receipts to the college staff. 
The police are currently investigating the case.

The first information report was registered based on the complaint of Islampura Station House Officer Asim Jehangir, who alleged that the lawyers engaged in extensive firing, abducted Police Constable Shahid at gunpoint, and subjected him to torture.
He said that the attackers also assaulted and tortured DSP Ghazi Mohammad Sarwar Awan when he attempted to rescue the constable.
He said that these lawyers gathered outside the Aiwan-i-Adl shortly after the conclusion of the Lahore Bar Association’s annual elections, chanting slogans.
According to the FIR, most of the named lawyers were carrying 30-bore pistols while leading the gathering of 300 others. One of them also used a 9MM pistol.
The lawyers opened fire, hitting an official van and the Metro Bus’s bridge. Despite repeated requests from police officers to refrain from taking the law into their own hands, they ignored the warnings and continued massive firing.
The complainant stated that a group of armed lawyers, including Mohammad Riaz, Muhammad Ahsan, Irfan, Rana Ibrar, and Adil, kidnapped Police Constable Shahid. As the DSP attempted to rescue him, the lawyers attacked him with an iron chair, causing serious injuries. 
The complainant concluded that the lawyers took the law into their own hands, committed a heinous crime, and instilled terror in the area.

The study, which analyzed the latest data on power cuts, sheds light on the impact of these incidents on businesses globally.
According to the study, Papua New Guinea claims the top spot for experiencing the highest number of business-related power outages, with 503 incidents annually. Yemen follows closely behind with 466 power outages per year, attributing its struggles to meet electricity demands, particularly in the capital city, Aden.
Central African Republic emerges as the country where power cuts incur the highest financial losses for firms, amounting to more than a 25% reduction in annual sales. The study highlights the stark contrast in the impact of power outages on businesses across continents, with European countries losing only 0.7% of sale value, compared to 7.8% in Africa, 4.0% in Asia, and 2.2% in South America.
Nigeria secures the third position with 394 annual power outages, followed by Central Asian Republic (348), Benin (336), Bangladesh (314), Nigger and Pakistan (264 each), Republic of Congo (258), and the Gambia (253).
While compiling the study, the firm used the World Bank data to find the number of power outages in firms during a typical month for each country. It multiplied the monthly power outages by twelve to reveal each country’s average annual power outages.
“We used the World Bank to find the value lost to electrical outages for each country. The most recent figures for each country were used, which ranged between 2006 and 2022. We removed Israel, Ukraine and Russia from our rankings,” it says.

5,Khawar Manika’s brothers get PML-N tickets,SAHIWAL: The PML-N has been divided into three groups over the distribution of tickets in Pakpattan city. One group...,"SAHIWAL: The PML-N has been divided into three groups over the distribution of tickets in Pakpattan city. One group is led by Ahmed Raza Manika, second by Mian Naveed Ali and third is led by Atta Muhammad Manika.
This awkward situation emerged after the announcement of PML-N tickets for Pakpattan tehsil which consists of three constituencies — NA-139, PP-193 and PP-194.
Interestingly, two brothers of Khawar Manika, former husband of Imran Khan’s wife Bushra, have been accommodated on two seats -- Ahmed Raza Manika from NA -139 and Farooq Ahmed Manika from PP-193.
By doing so, the PML-N leadership conveniently ignored its local stalwarts and ex-parliamentarians Pir Tariq Shah Khagga, Mian Naveed Ali and Hayat Manika.  
Mian Naveed Ali, who won PP-194 twice on PML-N tickets in 2013 and 2018, was not awarded ticket. His expected slot
was rather awarded to an unexpected aspirant Chaudhry Javed Ahmed.
Mian Naveed told a press conference on Saturday night the PML-N had ditched him by awarding party ticket to a person who won elections way back in 2008. Recalling his sacrifices, he said “I stood by the party and supported Mian Shahbaz Sharif in hard times.” He said the PML-N should have honoured the fact that his late father Rana Ahmed Ali remained loyal to the Sharifs during the last two decades.
He announced to contest the election as an independent and vowed to vote in favour Mian Nawaz Sharif, if elected.
The other person who will contest the election as an independent candidate is Hayat Manika, a son of Atta Muhammad Khan Manika. Mr Atta Makina said Mian Shabaz Sharif had promised to award ticket to his son but backed out.
Party’s district and tehsil office-bearers and activists are also divided into three groups and each is supporting independent candidates as opposed to the candidates who were officially awarded party tickets.
Identical is the situation in Chichawatni. After N’s failure to have seat adjustment with Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party, Malik Nouman Langriyal was not allowed a ticket from NA-143.
Nouman is contesting the election along with Falak Sher Langriyal on his party symbol eagle from NA-143 and PP-204. Jutt Brothers of Chichawatni categorically decided to contest elections as independent.
Tufail Jutt decided to contest jointly with PTI leader Adil Saeed Gujjar from NA- 143 and PP -204, respectively, under the “Ittehad Group”. Both candidates were denied tickets by their mother parties- -- PML-N and PTI.
After the denial of bat symbol, PTI candidates are contesting elections with different symbols.
TRAINING: The first batch of 50 presiding and assistant presiding officers has accomplished two-day election training conducted by master trainers of the Election Commission.
Around 2,800 presiding and assistant presiding officers will be trained by the end of this month.
Muhammad Aatir, District Election Officer, said the ECP provided training material and manuals to POs and APOs. Most of the election staff has been taken from educational institutions.

6,"punjab notes: Our history, their history",Animals have no sense of history. Memory inseparably linked with history is generally for them what has happened...,"Animals have no sense of history. Memory inseparably linked with history is generally for them what has happened recently. The past for them is a sort of past that ceases to stimulate the brain. So the past is past, dead and gone, something that shortly after coming into existence becomes non-existent.  
Humans, on the other hand, in their evolutionary process have developed two distinct and distinguishing things; enduring memory and imagination. The former keeps humans connected in some way with the bygone eras i.e. with the activities of their forebears making them realise that what they are is in a large measure the result of the past. The latter invests them with the capability to make plans for their future by enabling them to have imaginative construction of what they want to do in the days to come. It shows the dynamism and initiative humans have in determining the course of their life. They cannot change the past but they can surely subvert it if they choose to do so by erasure and interpreting it in a subjective manner i.e. to impregnate it with the meanings of their choice at the cost of being objective.
The societies which have smooth continuity generally do not fall victims to such a delusion. But the ones that depart from their natural course or have rupture with what was their previous existence are found prone to develop collective amnesia. Our society falls in the latter category as it suffered an excruciatingly painful rupture with the society it was part of previously a little more than seven decades ago.  
The act of separation proved so bloody that it changed its entire perspective on its own history. 
Subsequently, Pakistan, a new state with ancient people, developed a peculiar view of its history underpinned by two distinct features; selective approach and distorted interpretational method.  
First, the selective reading of history! As Pakistani state came into being on the basis of religion i.e. by distinguishing itself as Muslim and separate from Hindus and people of other faiths, it refused to own what it shared with other non-Muslims. Under the influence of its ideological stance, it deliberately started disowning what it has/had common with the peoples of diverse faiths. It in fact undertook the task of erasing its own 5,000-year old shared history. In doing so it conveniently forgot that its people started accepting new Islamic faith only in the 8th century CE after the Arab invasions from the south. The result is that it has willingly disowned what legitimately belongs to it; a great civilisation.  
The undeniable concrete signs of such a civilisational march can clearly be seen in Mehergarh, Harappa, Mohenjo Daro and Gandhara. The history of human society in this part of the world goes back even further; it had its beginnings in the Pothohar region of Punjab. All such invaluable historical assets have been sacrificed at the altar of ideology based on the perceived separateness. Our selective approach to history means we arbitrarily begin to read and own history not in its entirety but from a certain point in time and sanitise it in a way that it suits our current ideological goals which stand on what is comparatively of recent origins if seen in the perspective of development of civilisation. 
Consequently, we deprive ourselves of the contribution we made in the evolution and development of human society. We love to impoverish ourselves while we have inherited cultural assets that can enrich us tremendously. Firstly, we take a likeable fragment of history and offer and treat it as if it’s our complete history. The attempt is a shenanigan to conceal history in favour of ideology. The desired goal is the erasure of long shared history and culture evolved over millennia. 
Secondly, what we take as our history is explained and interpreted in such a manner that it becomes glaringly distorted as it is seen exclusively through the lens of faith and ideology that emphasise our estrangement from non-Muslim society, conflict with it, not togetherness. We do ourselves a grave damage by forgetting that human groups can change their religious beliefs but not their history. They can change their way of living but not their DNA. We do all such cultural cleansing in the name of faith but become oblivious of Muslim societies’ history which offers a different picture.  
In the seventh century, majority of Arabs converted to a new religion called Islam but they kept all the worth keeping things they inherited from their past, their language, names, dress and many cultural practices.  
Away from Arabia something similar happened in the Indonesian archipelago. People converted to Islam but they retained their names and cultural practices. Have you heard of Indonesian’s former president called ‘Megawati Sukarnoputri’? Does it remind you of her Hindu past? Surely, it does. ‘Megawati’ in Sanskrit means rain bearing cloud and ‘Sukarnoputri’ means Sukarno’s daughter. We have the same word ‘putri’ for daughter in Punjabi. Her Sanskrit name doesn’t make her a lesser Muslim.  
Iranians similarly have some of pre-Islamic names such as Ardeshir, Drab, Farhad and Javid, for example. They happily celebrate the pre-Islamic Zoroastrian New Year festival ‘Navroz’.
Those who insist on maintaining the religion-driven separateness from the sub-continental society must learn a lesson or two from the Arabs. What we call Arabs share faith and dialects of the same language but have a score of independent states. No Arab state denies the culture and civilisation shared by other Arab states and societies for being an independent state.
In a nutshell, separate states with common civilisation can co-exist. And they do co-exist if historical evidence is anything to go by. So the question is to both, Pakistani and Indian ruling cliques. Why can’t they co-exist in separate states while sharing the same civilisation? Pakistani ruling clique can come out of its ideological cocoon hardened by fear if it cares to remember that sub-continental civilisation had its glorious origins in the regions that now comprise the state of Pakistan. It will lose nothing but gain tremendously if it sheds the skin of its specious argument in favour of exclusivity and owns what legitimately belongs to it; Harappa civilisation as it objectively is. — soofi01@hotmail.com

7,PML-Q still in shock after being ditched by PML-N,Party is yet to issue list of candidates for upcoming elections.,"LAHORE: The PML-Q is completely silent after being ‘ditched’ by the PML-N on seat adjustment formula and has yet not been able to come up with its list of candidates contesting the upcoming general elections. 
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has already issued election symbols to all parties’ candidates and completed the process, leading to the general election on Feb 8. 
PML-Q Punjab secretary general Shafay Hussain and party leader Chaudhry Salik Hussain did not respond to repeated calls and WhatsApp messages regarding the list of their candidates contesting the general election. 
Soon after the PML-N announced its candidates even on those seats claimed to be left open for the PML-Q in seat adjustment formula except two seats each in National and Punjab Assembly constituencies, Salik Hussain had tweeted that the party had decided to break electoral alliance with the PML-N. 
In his tweets, Mr Salik, the former federal minister and son of PML-Q president Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, stated the PML-N should also issue tickets to its candidates against him and his brother Chaudhry Shafay Hussain “as we are ready for the electoral clash without any seat adjustment with the PML-N”. 
He also stated that the PML-Q candidates were standing by the party and it would reciprocate by standing by them and go ahead against the PML-N in Feb 8 election. 
Shafay said the PML-N and PML-Q senior leaders had gone into detailed discussions on seat adjustments and thrashed out all constituencies district-wise and eventually agreed that the PML-N would leave four National Assembly and eight Punjab Assembly constituencies open for his party but it backtracked. 
Shafay had stated that the party might field its 12 candidates on different seats but did not explain the details of party candidates. 
Chaudhry Moonis Elahi, who along with his father had left PML-Q and joined PTI, had sarcastically tweeted on the matter as: “Tara aur Sitara ka drama shuru”.

The case was registered based on the complaint of Assistant Returning Officer Muhammad Ali for NA-171-RYK-III.
According to the first information report filed by City A-Division police under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997-7, and sections 353, 155, 442, 342, 256/II, 145, and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code, Mr Ali and his staff were busy in their office at 6:35pm on Saturday when Mr Mustafa, accompanied by Hassaan Mustafa, Basharat Hundal, Jam Mansoor, Raees Muazzam, Mian Ahmed Athar, and 100-125 lawyers, entered the office firing shots. They demanded the return of their nomination papers, intending to replace “PTI” with “PTI Nazriati” and be allotted the symbol of PTI-Nazriati. When Ali refused, citing rule violations, they allegedly attacked him with arms and slapped him. Subsequently, they went to the district returning officer office after breaking the locks of the main gate, holding a government officer hostage for two and a half hours using abusive language.
Before the FIR’s registration, the information was shared in the Information Department’s WhatsApp group. In contrast, the DBA dismissed the entire story as fabricated. 
Newly-elected DBA Muhammad Afzaal Chaudhary informed Dawn that the DBA has declared a strike on Monday against the perceived one-sided action of the deputy commissioner. Mr Chaudhary said that a general council meeting has been called for Tuesday. He said that when Mr Mustafa attempted to obtain his allotted symbol in the office of Returning Officer Ahmed Raza Butt, he was informed that his demand was rejected. Due to the absence of the RO at his seat, supporters of Mustafa, along with many lawyers, went to the DC/DRO office to file a complaint. Allegedly, the DC did not listen to their grievances, misbehaved with lawyers, and ordered them to leave his office. An exchange of harsh words ensued between the lawyers and the DC, but eventually, all supporters left the DC office peacefully. Mr Chaudhary claimed that recorded footage and video clips would expose the false FIRs against lawyers and innocent individuals.

Speaking at an election meeting in National Assembly’s constituency NA-126, she said that those who use votes of the masses to get personal benefits cannot be called leaders.
She said people were facing inflation, hunger and unemployment and Bilawal Bhutto, following the footsteps of grandfather and mother, was contesting polls from Lahore to challenge those who had held Punjab ‘hostage’ for the last many years.
Referring to PTI’s violent protest on May 9, in which army installations were attacked and monuments of martyrs were desecrated, she said that the PPP had not resorted to such violence even on the martyrdom of then party chairperson Benazir Bhutto.
Instead the party increased the salaries of government employees by 120 percent after coming into power, she added.
Shehla Raza said that “democracy is the name of people and if a leader does not come among the people, then he is not a leader. Also, if someone leaves the country in difficult time, he cannot be a leader,” apparently a reference to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.
She urged estranged PPP workers to return to their party as their leader had dug his heels and was adamant to implement a pro-masses agenda.
She explained the 10-point election manifesto of the PPP that includes free 300 units of electricity to each poor household, provision of state-of-the-art health facilities, quality education for all, increasing agricultural production, and introducing pro-people schemes to be funded through the Benazir Income Support Programme.
