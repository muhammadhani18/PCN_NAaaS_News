0,Stuck in the blame game mindset,Archaic mindsets and policy issues prevent the country from achieving its economic potential.,"The successive resignations of Supreme Court judges test the resilience of the judicial system, pre-election disputes strain the inner cohesion of political parties, and stagflation pushes the endurance levels of the working masses.
While the country slowly moves forward despite daunting challenges with the support of donors, the GDP gap not only persists but has likely been growing. The GDP gap, signifying the disparity between actual and potential GDP over a long-term trend, is a globally tracked metric. Given its substantial potential, why is the GDP gap not closing?
The private sector in Pakistan and the government engage in trading blame for this gap. Certain experts point to the archaic mindset prevailing among leadership (both in the public and private sectors) and the management team conditioned to operate within a protective, patronage-centric environment as crucial factors contributing to economic underperformance. According to them, these elements often lack the readiness to compete in the global market and display reluctance towards risk-taking.
Pakistan, however, doesn’t rank among the worst performers globally. Information circulating through social media platforms suggests that conflict-ridden countries, including Ukraine, Sudan, Myanmar, Haiti and Iraq, have larger negative GDP gaps.

Archaic mindsets and policy issues prevent the country from achieving its economic potential

Pakistan is mentioned in the context of clusters of underperformers. According to a report on social platforms, there are also negative gaps in specific regions, including Latin America (Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Chile), South/Southeast Asia (Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos), and West-Central Africa (Ghana, Burkina Faso, Gabon). While verifying or authenticating the data used is challenging, the results seem plausible.
In private conversations, business leaders share numerous instances where government policies have compromised their business prospects, almost penalising success in entrepreneurship.
One tycoon pointed out, “The primary focus of economic ministries seems to be extracting the maximum resources through multiple taxes and duties to the extent that it de-incentivise balancing, modernisation and restructuring (BMR), as well as fresh investment in the industry.”
Another prominent leader in the food industry lamented, “We have halted our expansion plans due to the government’s hostile attitude. While our brand is well-received overseas, the current levels of duties on imported inputs, coupled with record-high taxes, make further investment to improve and enhance production capacity unviable. It is quite frustrating to witness other suppliers gaining ground in our market.”
Several former officials of economic ministries present their perspectives, portraying the business class of the country in a negative light. One official remarked, “The business class in Pakistan is often seen as parasitic. They appear spoiled and lazy, addicted to concessions. Many shamelessly leverage personal connections for favourable Special Regulatory Orders (SROs).
“There seems to be a lack of drive to excel and an aversion to healthy competition. They prefer taking full credit for success but are quick to blame external factors for failures, even when those failures stem from their own miscalculations and missteps.
“Their inclination to invest rests on the willingness of the government to bear the burden of risks. Ask any commerce secretary, and they would likely recount numerous instances where unprofessional conduct of Pakistani seths led to embarrassment at global forums and with trading partners.”
Musadaq Zulqarnain, Chairman of Interloop, the third largest exporter with a brand recognised for product quality, expressed dissatisfaction with the generalisation of Pakistani businessmen as incompetent and rent-seeking. He noted, “While there might be a trend of seeking instant success by fair means or foul, it is not the sole cause of the underperformance of Pakistani economy.
“The challenges include lack of strategy, insufficient talent development and a reluctance to build long-lasting sustainable businesses. Simultaneously, there is limited interest in investing in productive projects due to incentives favouring investment in non-productive avenues with relatively lower risk.”
Muhammad Younus Dhagha, Caretaker Minister in Sindh for revenue, industries and commerce, who served on both sides of the fence, earlier as a federal secretary for the government and later in the private sector as an adviser to the president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry believes that both public and the private sectors bear responsibility.
When discussing untapped potential, he attributed the challenges to “Policy paralysis and short-term-ism on the part of the government and lack of imagination and risk aversion on the part of the private sector”.
The head of an economic research body, who chooses to remain anonymous, made a pointed remark when discussing the subject. “The system in Pakistan promotes the pursuit of making money easily. The privileged class utilises plots, perks, protocols, and sometimes direct transfers.
“They engage in the exchange of assets through gifts, a practice deemed perfectly legitimate. Personal relationships and marriages are contracted to multiply wealth. This boundless accumulation of wealth receives protection through various subsidies, allowing it to multiply further. Even professionals face little competition as there’s no peer review or pressure to improve their skills. This situation has turned Pakistan into a perfect market for lemons.”
The society’s elite are unwilling to learn from missteps and continue on the path to destruction. Those who matter, key political leaders, and top businesses are all in this together,” said Asad Ali Shah, responding to the question of who is responsible for Pakistan’s economic underperformance.

1,Emerging consensus,"If a common agenda is implemented, the next government may be able to fulfil its tenure.","


 
In a challenging, complex situation, one can see consensus-building surfacing on how to resolve major issues, both by design as well as by independent actions of various stakeholders/institutions that tend to work in harmony.
A major issue on which near-consensus or consensus is so obvious is that elections should be held as scheduled on February 8. And that long-term policies can only be formulated by a representative government empowered by the electorate with a fresh mandate.
It is generally realised that public policies, including reforms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), need to have national ownership to ensure their effective implementation and improved governance.
After recent interaction with major political parties, the IMF officials said that their leaders acknowledged the need for continuing structural reforms agreed upon with the IMF.

If a common agenda is implemented, the next government may be able to fulfil its tenure

While happy with the interim government, the entire business community is of the unanimous view that timely elections and peaceful transfer of power to the next democratically elected government is necessary for ensuring stability and progress.
And the United States has repeatedly reiterated that it wants Pakistan to remain on the democratic path. Even Chinese investors are reported to be waiting for an elected government to assume office before committing to any long-term undertaking. The World Bank recently noted that there had been broad support for critical fiscal management and revenue reforms across the political spectrum.
Even those who advocate that Pakistan needs to develop its home-grown long-term economic strategy to resolve multiple crises recognise that any national strategy should provide space for the next longer-term IMF programme when the current Stand-By Agreement ends.
The above moves, creating a dent in political polarisation, may also be seen as a part of an emerging culture of transformational change. As an example, for the long-term, PTI has decided to contest the upcoming elections under the slogan ‘Change the System — Change Pakistan’.
Democracy works for the majority when pro-people policies are approved by the voters and implemented by their elected representatives.
Whether it is an ailing corporate entity, a dysfunctional institution or an unworkable economic model, the solution lies in the culture change that begins with the change of mindset of those involved in running them. The changing ground realities and interplay of social forces serve as catalysts.
For instance, there is a consensus that the increase in productivity, value-addition and product diversification cannot take place without prioritising human resource development.
The latest trend in foreign trade shows that Pakistan’s exports to the regional countries, particularly to the affluent oil-rich Middle East and China, with a huge market, are picking up fast while its exports to the US and some European countries have marginally declined. We are also moving towards some sort of consensus that we have to live within our means.
In his paper ‘Understanding Import Substitution in Theory and Practice’ presented at an event organised by the National Tariff Commission, Dr Safdar Sohail, Executive Director, Social Protection Resource Centre, recently shared insight into three megatrends. They evolved around new approaches, necessitating revision of import substitution strategies for global South nations like Pakistan with current development taking place in the global North.
Global cooperation, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF), has declined by two per cent from 2020 to 2022. The Global Cooperation Baro­meter, developed in collaboration with McKinsey and Company and launched by WEF, uses 42 indicators to measure five pillars of global cooperation: trade and capital, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security.
Within Pakistan, no undemocratic and arbitrary move goes unchallenged, often yielding positive outcomes, notwithstanding some hiccups. The rejections of scores of nomination papers by the returning officers were set aside by the election tribunals. About 76pc appeals by PTI candidates were accepted.
Though the PTI leadership is under huge political pressure following the May 9 incident, media reports indicate that its popular support is intact.
The Supreme Court is also strengthening the role of parliament in national affairs. In a 6-1 majority verdict, it has squashed life disqualification for lawmakers under Article 62(1))f) of the Constitution, which effectively renders Nawaz Sharif and Jahangir Tareen free to contest upcoming general elections.
The above trends indicate how things are taking shape, notwithstanding the historical baggage. Public pressure is also mounting on political parties not to delay announcing their manifestos for approval of voters.
In the case of a split electorate mandate, political rivals would need to work together on a common agenda to form a representative coalition government. Seat adjustments among various parties and PML-N and MQM-P agreement on empowering local bodies may be seen as a move in this direction.
If the common agenda, reflecting the aspirations of the people, is implemented sincerely, it may open up the opportunity for the next government to complete its mandate term.

Argentine Tomas Sislian packs his belongings as he prepares to move out of the rented apartment, pushed by the real estate crisis, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The real estate crisis, in a context of high inflation and where rents can be set in dollars, plunges tenants into helplessness. The National Institute of Statistics and Census announced the inflation rate for December at 25.5pc. Thus, 2023 closed with annual inflation at 211.4pc, one of the highest in the world.—AFP

 
The decreasing Chinese population
With the number of babies in free fall — fewer than 10m were born in 2022, compared with around 16m in 2012 — China is headed toward a demographic collapse. China’s population, now around 1.4bn, is likely to drop to just around half a billion by 2100, according to some projections. Many young people in China, disheartened by a weak economy and high unemployment, seek alternatives to their parents’ lives. Many women view the prescribed formula of marriage and children as a raw deal. When Beijing said it would abolish its 35-year-old one-child policy in 2015, officials expected a baby boom. Instead, they got a baby bust. New maternity wards were built only to close a few years later. Sales of baby-care products have dropped. Businesses that focused on babies now target seniors. New preschools struggle to fill classrooms and many have closed.

Historic low CFA passing rate
The pass rate for the first level of the chartered financial analyst exam fell further below its historic average. It’s another sign that test-takers are still dealing with pandemic-related disruptions that became common after the Covid-19 outbreak. In November, 35pc of candidates passed the Level I test, down from 37pc for those who sat for the exam in August and 39pc in May, the CFA Institute said last week. That’s the lowest pass rate since 2021, when results hit record lows across all levels of the CFA exam as performance was hurt by the pandemic. It’s also below the 40pc average for the past decade, according to the institute. The CFA Institute continues to attribute the Level I pass-rate decline to exam deferrals. Candidates are more likely to benefit from their earlier studies and retain their study material if they stay on schedule for taking their tests, according to the institute.

India under Modi
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s next election campaign will focus on his economic record – but what do the figures show? During his two terms in office, India has, on average, been one of the fastest-growing large economies. It is now firmly in the sights of international investors, consultants and trading partners, which would have been implausible a decade ago. But India’s growth rate was even higher from 2000 to 2010, at more than 6pc on average, and it is the poorest among the Brics nations, said Raghuram Rajan, professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a former Reserve Bank of India governor, referring to the grouping that also includes Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa. It ‘has a much longer distance of travel before it reaches their level of per capita income’, he said. ‘Growth has been good, but it has to be set in perspective.’

‘Soft’ sells
Cute, squishable toys were one of America’s hottest gifts. Ahead of a holiday season dampened by a weak forecast, toy makers and retailers tried to stay flush with plush. Toy sales were down 8pc in 2023, compared with 2022, but plush toys enjoyed a soft landing, up 4pc for the year, according to market research firm Circana. Plush-toy sales grew to $1.7bn in October from $846m in October 2020. To stand out from the crowd, plush-toy makers seek to best their rivals in softness and cuddle-ability. “We think about plush the way you think about thread count in sheets,” said David Socha, the CEO of Beverly Hills Teddy Bear. “The average plush might have 300 to 400 threads per inch. But ours is 1,000-plus per inch. It’s buttery, silky, cloud-soft that is cool to the touch.”

4,"FED unfazed by presidential barbs, transcripts show","Though US presidents take a hands-off attitude towards the central bank, Trump’s frustration over Powell mounted during his tenure.","

On the surface, Donald Trump’s blistering comments about the Federal Reserve beginning in 2018 seemed a grand breach of protocol for a US president, with the businessman-turned-politician railing against a “loco” central bank he thought was undermining his economic policies with interest rate increases.
Inside the Fed, however, an institution designed to be insulated from direct political influence, Trump’s insults in interviews and social media posts landed with nary a whisper among policymakers, according to newly released transcripts of the US central bank’s eight policy meetings in 2018, a year that marked the leadership change from former Chair Janet Yellen to current chief Jerome Powell, who was handpicked by Trump.
Powell, at least in the official record of the Fed’s meetings released last Friday, never uttered Trump’s name, and neither did any of the Fed governors and reserve bank presidents charged with navigating what proved a surprisingly turbulent year for monetary policymakers.
The economy overall was moving along well with strong growth and low unemployment.

Though US presidents take a hands-off attitude towards the central bank, Trump’s frustration over Powell mounted during his tenure in the White House

But the new trade policies of the Trump administration, including tariffs and curbs on trade with China, had introduced a wealth of unknowns into the monetary policy debate, including the possibility of higher inflation and growth fueled by tax cuts that figured into the Fed’s gradual rate increases.
By the time of the Fed’s Nov 7-8, 2018 meeting, financial conditions had grown notably tighter, especially in the aftermath of an interview Powell had given to the Public Broadcasting Service a month earlier that stoked a sell-off in stocks and a sharp widening in credit spreads on corporate bonds.
Simon Potter, who was at the time the head of the New York Fed’s markets operations, noted how the Powell interview — in which he said the Fed’s policy rate was “a long way” from neutral, or the point at which it was neither stimulative nor restrictive — was seen by markets as a turning point.
The “notable rise in Treasury yields” that day, Potter said, “precipitated a subsequent reassessment of equity valuations. The move in yields was attributed in part to better-than-expected economic data as well as comments by Chairman Powell that were seen as suggesting a potentially more restrictive monetary policy path and a higher neutral rate.”
“Financial conditions” were mentioned 22 times at that meeting, notably more than at either of the two previous policy gatherings, and key Fed officials, such as Richard Clarida, then the Fed’s vice chair, took stock of a situation in terms that have echoed the central bank’s current deliberations on whether to call time on a tightening cycle.
Clarida mentioned rising bond-yield “term premiums” and posited there was a historic case for the bond market doing “some of the Fed’s job for it” — topics that have been bandied about by current central bank officials.
He also described an economy not unlike the present one — with faster-than-trend growth expected soon to cool, a job market at or near full employment and risks of “excess-demand-driven” inflation seen as likely to fade and augur for a change in policymakers’ outlook.
At the Dec 18-19 meeting that year, policymakers boosted the Fed’s benchmark overnight interest rate to the 2.25-2.50 per cent range, in what would prove to be the final increase of that hiking cycle.
“With growth expected to decline to closer to trend next year, we can afford to be patient about further policy firming, especially in an environment in which inflation is still muted,” Powell told his colleagues.
The Fed leader described an economy where the data had been strong, but sentiment was weak while noting upside inflation risks had declined and the risks of tighter financial conditions had risen.
While that debate included extensive staff analysis of how new international trade frictions and administration policies were influencing the economy, that was the only apparent avenue through which Trump entered the discourse.
There was only one direct reference to Trump’s running commentary about the Fed, and that was to document that it was having no influence.
At the July 31-Aug 1 meeting, Fed staff discussed how “recent comments by President Trump” had influenced the views of market participants about monetary policy, and found in a survey that investors felt the president “would have no material effect on the (rate-setting Federal Open Market) Committee’s reaction function.”
Though US presidents typically take a hands-off attitude towards the Fed, Trump’s frustration over Powell and the central bank mounted during his four years in the White House. He would eventually call Powell an enemy of the US, comparing him to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and saying the Fed chief was among his worst appointments.
Trump, who is favoured to be the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, is running even with President Joe Biden at the outset of the race for the White House, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week.
Should the former president win the Nov 5 election and return to the White House next year, it will mark a reunion of sorts. Powell’s current term lasts through May 2026, 16 months after the next presidential inauguration.

5,Stocks beyond myths,Overcoming false perceptions regarding the PSX can help investors make informed decisions and achieve financial growth.,"It requires a great deal of boldness and a great deal of caution to make a great fortune, and when you have got it, it requires ten times as much wit to keep it’ Nathan Mayer Rothschild.
Financially strangled, uncertain future, and hopelessness. These words best describe the struggling class of Pakistan. Savings only in the form of real estate, gold, and foreign currencies make sense to Pakistanis.
According to a recent 2023 Gallup survey, 61 per cent of Americans own stocks (directly or through mutual funds). Meanwhile, the International Organisation of Scientific Research Journal of Business Management found that only 0.14pc of Pakistan’s population holds a capital markets account, highlighting a stark lack of widespread financial engagement. Mass public involvement in capital markets breaks monopolies and boosts the country’s future financial prospects.
False perceptions of the stock market are pervasive. A prevalent public opinion is that the stock market is akin to a casino. The positive outcomes of your investment are based on whether it’s your lucky day. Also, you never know how the share prices will fluctuate. Is it sane to have this opinion? I dare to disagree. Sometimes, it’s just complex to predict the future price of the shares, but it’s black and white. You just need to comprehend the holistic view and make the right calls at the right time.

Overcoming false perceptions regarding the PSX can help investors make informed decisions and achieve financial growth

In Pakistan, people choose gold, real estate and foreign currencies because it’s two plus two. Another important similarity between these three is they are tangible, and stocks are virtual. This stark distinction unfolds the pattern of the investor’s approach. The tangibility bias in investment affects judgments of risk.
According to Theodore Noseworthy, Professor of Marketing and Canada Research Chair in Entrepreneurial Innovation and the Public Good at Schulich, “Tangibility signals low risk because it’s associated with a sense of permanence.” It also provides an objective sense of ownership to the investor.
So, don’t Americans have this tangibility bias as they actively invest in stocks? A good answer might be “They made a significant leap in investing psychology.” How did they make such an advancement? The human brain can change only when it is open to learning new things and adapting to them practically. Financial literacy is the first step in bringing this change.
People believe that investing in stocks is arduous. Only financial experts can take on this Herculean task. This is also nothing but an overstatement. The financial ratios they calculate are now freely accessible on many websites/apps. It’s the interpretation of these ratios that decide where and when to invest.
Before making any decisions, consider factors such as macroeconomics, company management, future prospects, etc., in addition to financial ratio analysis. Other than those who invest in gold, real estate, or foreign currencies, there exist people who keep money in their cupboards, similar to ancient times when people used to conceal treasures.

One reason people choose gold, real estate and foreign currencies over stocks is that the former are tangible and thus affect investors’ judgements of risk

The concept of ‘time value of money’ is crucial for these people to understand. The currency loses value over time. What you could buy with Rs5 in the 1970s might only make you laugh in 2023. The same is the case with other strong currencies, such as the dollar. Investing is the best option to uphold the real value of your money.
The ambiguity regarding religious validation also hinders potential investors from participating in the Pakistan Stock Exchange. As a Muslim-majority country, the public is often confused about whether it’s prohibited to invest in stocks in Islam. It is entirely allowed to invest in stocks as you are getting into a partnership.
However, you just need to be cautious about the companies whose business is prohibited by religion. For instance, a liquor business.
Besides these misconceptions, one should set one’s financial goals for investing. What they plan to get out of it. Are you saving for a trip or for sending your children abroad for higher education? Or do you have after-retirement plans? We should be clear with our ‘why’ before investing.
For instance, the pension received by government employees post-retirement is essentially the sum deducted from their own salaries, which pension funds invested. Then why not invest your own money yourself?
To sum up, overcoming false perceptions regarding the stock market can help make informed investment decisions and financial growth. You don’t need to be a financial expert to invest in stocks; you can do wonders if you’re good with two plus two.

11,Hoarding dollars — the missing $1bn,Timely realisation of the export proceeds of willful defaulters cannot be ensured without strict enforcement of AML/CFT regime.,"With the government scrambling for dollars, knocking one door after the other to raise cash to keep the ongoing balance of payment crisis from morphing into a sovereign default, not less than a billion dollars in ‘overdue export proceeds’ remain to be repatriated.
The overdue export proceeds are those where an exporter is unable to repatriate their export revenues within 90-120 days from the date of shipment or within such periods as may be determined for the purpose by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for a particular sector, as notified from time to time, or on the due date of the bill whichever is earlier.
“The amount of $1 billion in overdue export proceeds is the one that is stuck in the SBP’s adjudication process. The actual amount of delayed export revenues could be three times bigger than that,” a senior banker who deals with such cases on behalf of his bank tells this correspondent.
For example, he points out that the overdue export proceeds that remain to be repatriated in spite of the passage of the due time in the case of his bank are nearly $150 million. “But only a third of that amount — $50m — is in the adjudication process of the State Bank,” he notes.

Timely realisation of the export proceeds of willful defaulters cannot be ensured without strict enforcement of AML/CFT regime

The delay of a few days or even weeks in repatriation of the export proceeds is not unusual because of genuine reasons, he says. Only the cases of chronic defaulting exporters are brought to the SBP’s adjudication panels. Some cases being adjudicated by the SBP pertain to export shipments made as long ago as one year to 20 years, the bankers claim.
Mostly, the chronic or wilful defaulting exporters are smaller, non-corporate entities and use the two riskiest modes of international trade settlement — ‘open account’ or ‘collections (contract basis)’ — for shipping their goods to their foreign buyers.
Over the past few years, especially during the pandemic, some exporters were not able to fully repatriate foreign proceeds against exports due to insolvency or bankruptcy of the foreign importers or refusal by importers to accept the exported goods and make payment, or for any other situation beyond the control of the exporters. In such cases, the exporters had to suffer significant losses.
Sometimes, exporters believe that the rupee might depreciate and hence delay the receipt of export proceeds, as seen during periods of high volatility in the foreign exchange market. The home currency depreciation always suits exporters as this fetches them a higher amount in rupee value.
However, the bankers contend, there are several ‘defaulters’ exporters who wilfully and intentionally keep their export proceeds abroad for investment purposes and bring back only the gains on their foreign investments.
The delay in the receipt of the export payments often reduces the supply of dollars in the economy, bringing pressure on the exchange rate and leading to home currency depreciation. Besides, it creates a dollar liquidity crunch for commercial banks and restricts their capacity to finance even essential imports.
The rupee lost almost a fifth of its value in 2023 due to the dollar supply gap as the country barely averted a default with the help of the International Monetary Fund, which signed off on a $3 billion short-term loan deal in July.
The year also saw the government impose strict import restrictions — often disallowing essential imports like pharmaceutical raw materials — to save dollars to prevent a sovereign default. “Pakistan, which is already experiencing critically low foreign exchange reserves and a high risk of default on foreign debt repayments, cannot afford such delays,” another banker argues.
The chronic overdue export proceeds portfolio is increasing in spite of measures taken by the State Bank last year to accelerate the realisation of the delayed export revenues to shore up the nation’s dwindling foreign exchange reserves.
In February 2023, the central bank decided to initiate necessary action in all those export cases where full export proceeds are not realised within the prescribed period as defined in the Foreign Exchange Manual. Changes were made in the manual to deny the defaulters the exchange rate benefits on their delayed export proceeds.
In March, the State Bank issued new regulations to tighten the process of repatriating export earnings into the country. Under the new rules, the exporters who delay bringing their export earnings into the country would face fines between three per cent and 9pc of their realised export proceeds.
The fines will be imposed if export proceeds are realised fully or partially after the prescribed period of up to 180 days, or earlier in some cases. In cases where export proceeds are realised, fully or partially, after the prescribed period (a maximum of 180 days in majority cases or earlier), authorised dealers (mostly commercial banks) would convert the export proceeds at the prevailing market exchange rate and credit the same into the exporters’ account.
They will also mark a 3pc lien on the amount of export proceeds delayed by up to 30 days, 6pc on the realisation of export proceeds delayed by more than 30 days to a maximum of 60 days, and 9pc on export payment received with a delay of more than 60 days.
Since the inception of foreign exchange judicial proceedings in 1990, the SBP has managed to realise $1.25bn from the defaulter exporters. Of this, $182m was repatriated in FY21 alone, mostly from Karachi ($58.5m), Lahore ($41.9m), Sialkot ($40.7m) and Faisalabad ($24.1m). More than 11,700 cases were adjudicated during that year. At the same time, 10,384 new cases were lodged in the same year, underlining the extent of the issue.
The bankers say the adjudication process is very slow, and penalties are low. Under the present rules, the defaulting exporters can be fined up to Rs500,000 for each contravention, and where the contravention is a continuing one with a further penalty which may extend to Rs10,000 for each day during which such contravention continues.
Thus, just Rs26m were recovered in fines from the defaulting exporters. “There are several reasons for the slow realisation of overdue export proceeds through the adjudication process,” a banker says. “For starters, it is difficult to determine wilful delay in repatriation of the proceeds. Then, the exporters often use their influence to delay the process. In some cases, it is seen that the adjudicating officers favouring and obliging the defaulting exporters,” he concludes.
He says the timely realisation of the export proceeds of willful defaulters cannot be ensured without strict enforcement of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. “In addition to that, the SBP will have to ensure that the adjusting officers conclude the cases swiftly and award heavy penalties to the wilful defaulters to set an example for the others.”

12,The remittances crunch,The increasing cost of living in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates poses a potential obstacle to sending additional foreign exchange back home.,"The inflow of remittances to Pakistan has yet to show a satisfactory trajectory since January 2022. The monthly inflow of remittances for the first three quarters of 2023 was lower than both the previous year and 2021. The count of remittances from January to November 2023 was $23.96 billion, reflecting a decrease of $3.83bn compared to the corresponding period in 2022 and $4.6bn compared to 2021.
The World Bank, in its report titled “Leveraging Diaspora Finances for Private Capital Mobilisation,” has projected a 10 per cent decrease in remittance flows to Pakistan for the current fiscal year. This revelation undoubtedly raises concerns because remittances hold a paramount significance for Pakistan and play a pivotal role in shaping Pakistan’s economic landscape.
In the realm of global financial flows, Pakistan ranks sixth among the top countries receiving remittances, with the remittances-to-GDP ratio exceeding 7pc.
The decline in remittances prompts concerns about its potential impact on the economy. The dramatic drop in foreign workers’ remittances signals a further blow to the economy, particularly on the external financing front. For instance, Pakistan’s external funding needs are estimated at $28.7bn for the current fiscal year, including $24.6bn for debt repayments and $4bn for financing the current account deficit.

The increasing cost of living in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates poses a potential obstacle to sending additional foreign exchange back home

The decline in remittances not only widens the current account deficit but also puts pressure on the foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
The SBP’s liquid foreign exchange reserves stand at $7.8 billion as of December 22, 2023. This figure is notably lower than the $20bn held by Bangladesh. The stock of foreign exchange reserves held by SBP is approximately equivalent to one month’s worth of import bills.
Notably, the forex reserves, below the three-month imports threshold, continue to indicate a currency under pressure. The constant strain on forex reserves invariably exerts pressure on the forex market, leading to an inherent instability in exchange rates.
For Pakistan, 2023 has swiftly earned the dubious distinction of being labelled the “year of financial mismanagement” due to a 20pc decline in the rupee against the US dollar. This decline is higher than the average fall of 13pc per year over the last five years and the average of 8pc per year over the past 10 years.
The consequences of declining remittances are evident, as they not only affect the real sector but also disturb the country’s financial position. The downward trajectory raises questions about the underlying factors that cause this worrisome trend. The decline in remittances can be attributed to a range of factors.

In the realm of global financial flows, Pakistan ranks sixth among the top countries receiving remittances, with the remittances-to-GDP ratio exceeding 7pc

Fueled by political instability, the current economic instability is causing exchange rate instability. The unstable exchange rate can create a gap between the open market and interbank market exchange rates. The widening gap inadvertently has led to a decline in remittances through formal banking systems and a subsequent increase from the informal sector.
Recent research indicates that remittances to Pakistan from informal sources have surged to a staggering $10 billion, further increasing the gap between open market and interbank market exchange rates.
The economic turmoil of 2023, sparked by political instability, not only triggered the balance of payment crisis but also worsened public confidence. The lower confidence of consumers, entrepreneurs, and investors ended with the slowdown of the real estate sector.
The slowdown was further fueled by the revision of the Capital Gain Tax and the inclusion of Deemed Income Tax as a wealth tax in the Finance Bill for FY24. Overseas Pakistanis also remit funds to engage in real estate investments. The potential decline in remittances is attributed to the slowdown in the real estate sector.
The ongoing global monetary tightening, which has led to higher interest rates in the international market, presents an opportunity for remitters to earn better returns. As a consequence, this surge in returns has inadvertently led to a decrease in remittances flowing into Pakistan.
Remittances are also declining due to the slow global economic growth and weakness in labour markets in several high-income migrant-hosting countries, particularly the United States and Eurozone countries. The slow global growth can be attributed to the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, exchange rate and oil price volatility, and a deeper-than-expected downturn in major high-income countries.
The outlook for remittance inflow to Pakistan in 2024 is not optimistic, primarily due to ongoing developments in the major remittance-sourced countries. For instance, the United Kingdom will be imposing minimum earning ceilings on immigrants starting this spring.
Additionally, the current political environment and labour market conditions in the United States will continue to impede the flow of remittances to Pakistan. Moreover, the increasing cost of living in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates poses a potential obstacle to sending additional foreign exchange back home.
Given the outlook of remittance inflow, it is crucial to proactively implement measures to prevent a potential balance of payment crisis. In this realm, ensuring exchange rate stability, coupled with efforts to curtail the flow of remittances through the informal sector, can safeguard against financial mismanagement.
In addition to this, it is crucial to emphasise the importance of fostering alternative sources of foreign exchange inflow. Simultaneously, it becomes imperative to carefully assess and rationalise the outflow of foreign exchange reserves.

13,Red Sea caution,"Disturbances in the operations of critical maritime passages can have ripple effects on Pakistan’s trade, business, and port activities.","The Houthi retaliation represents a danger to worldwide maritime transport. A resolute response is imperative for sustained global prosperity. To ensure the unimpeded passage of ships, particularly through vital chokepoints like the Strait of Malacca or the Panama Canal, addressing the recent surge of attacks in the Red Sea — crucial for access to the Suez Canal — stands as an urgent concern.
The Houthis, backed by Iran and situated in Yemen, have targeted ships from numerous nations, affecting freedom of navigation, all in support of the Palestinian cause. This pattern endangers not just the Red Sea route but echoes threats in other critical waterways. Effective action, without escalating Middle Eastern conflicts, is crucial for stability.
Approximately 20 per cent of global container volumes, 10pc of seaborne trade, and eight to 10pc of seaborne energy transit via the Red Sea and Suez Canal. However, recent disruptions have prompted major container-shipping companies to halt operations, and energy behemoth BP has paused oil shipments through this route.
While energy markets have remained relatively stable due to sufficient supply, container firms are experiencing soaring stock prices, indicating potential capacity shortages. The resultant spike in shipping costs between Asia and Europe signifies an imminent supply chain crunch.
Disturbances in the operations of critical maritime passages can have ripple effects on Pakistan’s trade, business, and port activities.
The formidable arsenal of drones and missiles possessed by the Houthis, supplied by Iran, will have a major impact, especially as these proxy forces target various interests in the region, given the militia’s capability to strike critical oil facilities in Saudi Arabia.
What do the disruptions in the Red Sea and Suez Canal mean for Pakistan’s economy, business landscape, and port activities? As a country highly dependent on imports, especially through maritime routes, any hindrance in the smooth passage of ships through critical waterways like the Red Sea can pose challenges.
Pakistan’s economy primarily relies on imported raw materials, with seaborne trade being a major component. The country’s ports, including Karachi Port and Port Qasim, serve as vital gateways for imports and exports. Any disturbances or interruptions in the Red Sea route or Suez Canal directly affect Pakistan’s trade, leading to delays in cargo shipments, increased transportation costs, and potential disruptions in the supply chain.
This, in turn, can impact various industries, including textiles, agriculture, and manufacturing, which heavily rely on imported raw materials and components.
Pakistan’s business landscape could witness adverse effects due to disruptions in these maritime routes. Many businesses rely on timely imports and exports to maintain their operations, and any delays or uncertainties caused by disruptions in the Red Sea could hamper their efficiency and profitability.
Increased shipping costs and potential supply chain bottlenecks might force businesses to reassess their strategies, leading to higher operational expenses and possible price hikes for consumers.
The activity in Pakistani ports, particularly the transhipment and handling of goods destined for or arriving from various international locations, may experience slowdowns or complications. If major shipping lines opt to reroute vessels away from the disrupted Red Sea route, Pakistani ports might experience reduced traffic, impacting port revenues and overall port-related activities.
This profoundly impacts Pakistani cargo companies and organisations heavily reliant on ports and shipping. Companies like Maersk Pakistan, operating as a vital player in Pakistan’s shipping and logistics sector, could face substantial challenges due to delayed or rerouted shipments, increasing operational costs, and uncertain delivery timelines.
With their trade routes traversing through the affected areas, these companies may encounter disruptions in supply chains, impacting their ability to meet client demands promptly.
Local industries, such as the textile sector, are also highly reliant on timely raw materials and machinery imports. Any disturbances in shipping schedules could lead to production slowdowns and increased costs for manufacturers.
Moreover, local exporters, including rice, fruits, and leather goods exporters, may face setbacks in accessing international markets due to delayed or interrupted shipping routes, adversely affecting their competitiveness and market share.
This will affect Karachi Port Trust and Port Qasim Authority, which could experience decreased port activity and revenue if shipping lines opt for alternative routes, impacting their operations and financial stability. The slowdown in port activity will lead to challenges and affect the efficient handling of cargo, causing revenue losses for these organisations, which rely on port-related activities.
Therefore, any disturbances in these critical maritime passages can have ripple effects on Pakistan’s trade, business, and port activities, necessitating strategic planning and proactive measures to mitigate potential disruptions.
It will translate into logistical challenges, increased costs, and operational hurdles for Pakistani cargo companies, local industries, exporters, and port authorities, ultimately impacting Pakistan’s overall trade and economic landscape.

14,A long way to go,"The government will have to rely heavily on bank borrowings for various needs, such as national security and salaries, leaving minimal funds for crucial development projects.","Pakistan’s yearly consumer inflation rate stood at 29.7 per cent in December 2023, which means that those who earned Rs100,000 per month needed Rs 129,700 to maintain their lifestyle at a year-ago level.
Obviously, most individuals and households had no opportunity to make the additional Rs29,700. Inflation numbers don’t tell us about their sufferings, let alone the sufferings of the jobless. We come to know about those sufferings in our daily interactions with such people.
According to the International Labour Organisation, there were no less than 5.6 million unemployed people at the end of December 2023.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), determined to bring down the inflation rate in the range of 20-22pc, has no option but to continue its tight monetary policy, which means interest rates will remain high. With the central bank’s key policy rate at 22pc, effective interest rates for most private sector borrowers remain close to 25pc. Can businesses grow amidst this high-interest rate environment? The answer is obvious: most of them cannot.

The government will have to rely heavily on bank borrowings for various needs, such as national security and salaries, leaving minimal funds for crucial development projects

To make the situation worse, excessive government bank borrowings continue to crowd out the private sector. During the first half of the current fiscal year (between July 1 and Dec 29, 2023), the government borrowed Rs4.14 trillion from commercial banks, of which it used Rs1.62tr for retiring previous central bank loans. So, net borrowings of the government for budgetary support stood at Rs2.52tr. Against this, net private sector borrowings from banks totalled just Rs373.5 billion.
Net budgetary borrowings in the same period of the last fiscal year were slightly lower than Rs389bn, according to the latest data released by the SBP. What caused this skyrocketing of the government’s budgetary borrowing? Well, the cost of domestic debt servicing in the first place — the amount of money the government pays back to banks as interest on previous loans.
As of November 2003, the total stock of the government’s domestic debt was Rs40.96tr. Just a year ago, at the end of November 2022, this amount was Rs32.99tr. A whopping amount of Rs7.97tr was added to domestic debt stock within just a year as foreign debt mobilisation grew increasingly difficult. It was bound to push the cost of domestic debt servicing, and it did just that.
This trend is sure to continue in the coming years. The stock of domestic debt is so huge that after the 8th February elections, the newly elected government will have to use the bulk of tax and non-tax revenue primarily to service this debt and a smaller part to service external debt.
It will have to borrow excessively from banks to meet all other requirements, including spending on national security and paying and pensioning government employees. Very little money will be available for development spending.
That will make it compulsory for the future government to look towards global financial institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development for financing crucial national development plans. And we all know that the newly elected government will also have to continue to borrow from the International Monetary Fund to keep Pakistan’s balance of payment in shape.
One can imagine what that would mean amidst dramatic shifts in geopolitics and a widening gulf of strategic interest between the West and the East. The situation will surely become more testing if the Israeli genocide of people in Gaza continues unchecked and the ongoing Israel-Hamas war turns into a wider military conflict in the region or the pro-Palestine Houthis attack on shipping lanes and vessels in the Red Sea and counter-attacks by the US and the UK do not come to an end.
One must remember this perspective to understand why Pakistan is anxiously trying to secure huge foreign investments from friendly countries through the civil-military-run Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). The basic idea is to lessen the burden of external debts and save the cost of external debt servicing while also leveraging foreign investment for industrial and agricultural growth to boost economic growth.
That may help contain growth in domestic debts and domestic debt servicing and free up resources for future domestic investment into development projects. It’s a long, arduous journey, and it would be naïve to expect that the country would get the desired results this year or even in the next year. The desired results may take several years to come.
In addition to containing the government’s domestic debt, getting rid of loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOE) is equally important. That is why SIFC is expediting the privatisation process. The stage is now set for the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines. Let’s hope it is done in the best professional manner and in the shortest possible time.
Pakistan’s SOEs inflicted a huge loss of Rs1.395tr to the national exchequer in just two years (FY21 and FY22), according to a recent report of the Ministry of Finance. Out of the 81 SOEs evaluated, the number of profitable SOEs dropped from 56 to 50 during this period.
How inefficient our SOEs have become over the years is also evident from the fact that, just like the government, they, too, continue to accumulate debts year after year to remain functional. At the end of September 2023, their total debt and liabilities totalled around Rs2.33tr, with a yearly increase of more than 24pc.
Whether an elected government will pursue the privatisation of loss-making SOEs as vigorously as caretakers cannot be predicted at this stage, but given the enormity of financial losses these SOEs make and given that they accumulate debts often without leveraging it for growth, fast-track privatisation seems to be the only solution for most of them.

17,Real estate cartels,"On the outskirts of populated areas, agricultural lands are being used for new settlements.","


 
With incapable overseers in action, Pakistan’s real estate industry stays in the hands of cartels whose executors — land acquisition experts, development companies, real estate consultants and construction groups — manifest a unity that manipulates property prices and controls the market to fill their pockets.
Let me start with how the world responds to the real estate cartels. On 15th December 2022, the Finnish Market Court fined the Finnish Real Estate Management Federation and six prominent companies for their clandestine involvement in the fixation of prices and exchange of commercially sensitive information.
In April 2021, the US District Court seized the properties owned by Rafael Caro Quintero, the Mexican cartel leader. The US government then sought international cooperation to call the culprit on the carpet. Similarly, the German Federal Supreme Court penalised Booking.com for practising cartel conduct in rental properties.
According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development International Cartels Database, cartels practice different tactics, including but not limited to price manipulation, information sharing, market allocation, curtailed competition, a network of associates, and other proscribed practices.

On the outskirts of populated areas, agricultural lands are being used for new settlements

The big show of real estate cartels prompt from acquisition of lands and end at financial exploitation of the innocent end-users. Intermediaries play their part in controlling the market by selling imaginary assets (plot files, booking forms, and allotment certificates) and on-ground properties.
The outcome of real estate cartelisation is harmful both for the national economy and the end-users of real assets. Developers are turning the green lands into gray lands, promoting unnecessary urbanisation while leaving no room for agriculture.
Financial loss to the national exchequer is yet another setback that stems from acquisition of lands at a very low price. It results in lower taxes generated and the Federal Board of Revenue suffers accordingly.
The canvas of real estate cartelisation is really massive, multifaceted and synchronised. Population growth and housing demands are the conjoined twins.
Since 1970, the global population growth rate has been declining to today’s 1.1 per cent. According to the Council of Common Interests, Pakistan’s population is increasing at a 2.6pc annual growth rate. In the absence of the development of new resources, this increase could further give rise to the housing deficit, which currently surpasses 12 million units, according to the State Bank of Pakistan.
After bringing the culture of urbanisation to the peripheries of big cities, the real estate cartels have entered small cities and towns. On the outskirts of populated areas, the agricultural lands are being used for new settlements. It obviously generates more profits for the cartels. They seem unaware of the concepts of food security and food crisis. A large number of property developers are on the scene, but cartels influence all of them.
The cartels have made the country’s real estate industry a safe haven for the tax evaders. It is money launderers’ beloved sector. If the cartels are not dismantled, the Financial Action Task Force could raise a louder voice for remodelling the real estate industry. It is better to mend our ways before the matter comes into the limelight at the transnational level.
For the last couple of years, Pakistan’s real estate market has faced problems chiefly caused by political instability, unethical practices, and economic depression. It has caused anxiety for the real estate cartels.
How can we undermine the effect of real estate cartelisation? The Competition Commission of Pakistan, through factual promulgation of the Competition Act 2010, could discourage such cartels from promoting free competition. The urban development bodies know the things happening behind the scenes. They can take the required actions to ensure free and fair market forces govern the real estate economy.
Cartels are always managed by powerful individuals and groups. They could be brought to the table to streamline the industry. Making real assets affordable could be the top priority. The responsible ones must face the music in the form of strict legal actions and heavy penalties.
Whistleblowing and general awareness campaigns could serve the purpose to a great extent. Conducting thorough investigations, imposing heavy fines, considering market reforms, and implementing new policies could help reverse the strength of real estate cartels. The matter must be taken into account before it further gives rise to money laundering and more cartels.
