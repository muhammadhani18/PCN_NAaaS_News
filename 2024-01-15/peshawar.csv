0,Mausoleum of Sufi Pashto poet in Landi Kotal turned into security post,Literary circles demand relocation of forces as death anniversary of Hamza Baba nears.,"KHYBER: With different literary organisations busy in making preparations for the 30th death anniversary of Sufi poet and renowned writer Ameer Hamza Khan Shinwari, popularly known as Hamza Baba and father of Pashto ghazal on February 18, security forces deployed at his mausoleum in Landi Kotal have largely restricted the entry of his disciples and followers to the premises.
During a visit to the mausoleum, this scribe found the main door closed from inside with the security personnel obstructing entry to the premises prior to taking permission from one of their senior officials present inside the mausoleum.
The head of officials inside the mausoleum, upon inquiry, told this scribe that they were deployed there about more than a month ago to provide security to the transit camp established for Afghan nationals returning to their homeland.
He was, however, at loss to mention an exact date for vacating the premises while arguing that they were there on the orders of their senior officials.
A machinegun mounted armoured personnel carrier vehicle (APC) was also parked inside the mausoleum while the library was converted into a bedroom-cum-kitchen by the new occupants with dirty utensils littering the place of serious reading.

Literary circles demand relocation of forces as death anniversary of Hamza Baba nears

The security personnel present there insisted that they were not stopping anybody from entering the mausoleum and paying homage to the renowned Pashto poet but they did ask about the identity of visitors and purpose of their visit.
Family sources of Hamza Baba and members of some local literary organisations, however, said that a considerable number of followers and fans of the great Pashto poet from different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan returned without offering homage at the mausoleum as they found the main door of the premises closed during their recent visits.
Family members regretted that local officials had not taken them into confidence before deployment of the security personnel inside the mausoleum. They said that security personnel should be deployed at the transit camp, adjacent to the mausoleum, instead of occupying the sacred place, which was frequently visited by hundreds of people as a mark of respect to Hamza Baba.
In their social media messages, the members of some local literary organisations, took exception to the presence of security personnel inside Hamza Baba mausoleum and converting the library into a kitchen and bedroom.
They said that personnel deputed for security of the transit camp should be relocated to another safe place near the camp and leave the mausoleum open for visitors, whose number was reduced owing to presence of forces there.
Literary circles insisted that their preparations for observing the forthcoming death anniversary of Hamza Baba would also be affected if security forces continued to occupy the mausoleum.

PTI candidate for NA-11 Haji Said Fareen Khan, candidate for PK-29 Haji Abdul Munim, Akhtar Ali Chatan and others addressed the rally. PTI leadership and candidates for different constituencies faced challenges like FIRs, arrest and imprisonment in cases related to May 9 riots and violation of Section 144 in the recent past.
On Sunday, Haji said Fareen, who joined PTI after quitting ANP in 2021, addressed the first public gathering as a candidate for NA-11. The rally was attended by PTI workers from Puran, Martung, Makhozi and Chakisar areas.
Addressing the rally, Haji Said Fareen said that he was going to contest the elections on PTI ticket but for the first time. He said that passion and devotion of PTI workers encouraged him and boasted his morale.
He said that their opponents had seen their defeat long ago due to which they hatched conspiracies. He said that with the support of Shangla people and PTI devoted workers, he would defeat Amir Muqam.
PTI candidate for PK-29 and former provincial minister Abdul Munim Khan said that despite taking away ‘bat’ symbol from them, people still loved PTI and they would take the revenge from their opponents through ballot on February 8.
“We had called a workers convention to launch election campaign but it turned into a big public gathering and workers showed their response to opponents and left a message to them that they stood by Imran Khan,” he said.
PTI provincial senior vice president and candidate for PK-28 Shaukat Yousafzai launched his election campaign in Kuz Kana area where several political activists joined PTI.

2,"PML-N enters into seat adjustment with PPP, JUI-N in Swabi",PTI's Asad Qaiser says candidates would contest the election with any symbol.,"SWABI: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s seat adjustments with Pakistan Peoples Party and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Nazriyati (JUI-N) have made the contest among leading candidates more tough and interesting in Swabi district.
PPP and PML-N have decided to support each other in NA-20, Swabi-II, and PK-53, Swabi-V.
As a result, Biland Iqbal Tarakai, PPP candidate for PK-53, has withdrawn in favour of Adil Khan, the PML-N candidate for the same constituency.
Similarly, Afsar Khan, PML-N candidate for NA-20, has given up the contest in favour of Usman Khan Tarakai, PPP candidate for the same constituency.
PPP and PML-N leaders told Dawn that their target was Shahram Khan Tarakai, a nephew of Mr Usman.
Mr Shahram contests from NA-20 and PK-53.
Political observers here said so far Shahram had not surfaced for running the election campaign and the seat adjustment and his absence might harm his political career.
The contest for Shahram has become even tougher after the PTI lost the ‘bat’ symbol.
Meanwhile, in NA-19, Swabi-1, PML-N and JUI-N have struck a seat adjustment. The JUI-N will support Shiraz Khan in PK-49, Swabi-1, and PML-N will support Maulana Khalil Mukhles of JUI-N in NA-19.
Shiraz Khan, who was contesting election from both NA-19 and PK-49, has withdrawn from the former and decided to support Maulana Khalil.
Here the seat adjustment will also impact the rival candidates, who had termed the alliance weak.
PML-N leaders said they had strengthened their position in the district with the seat adjustment.
Insiders said if Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl and Awami National Party entered a seat adjustment then it would make the election more interesting in the district.
QAISER’S REACTION: Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, while reacting to the Supreme Court’s verdict to overturn a Peshawar High Court decision to restore Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf ‘bat’ symbol, said on Sunday PTI candidates would contest the election with any symbol.
In a video message posted on his social media account addressing his supporters, he insisted the verdict didn’t reflect the wishes of people.
 






“All of you (masses) have seen the decision of the Supreme Court, is this verdict in accordance with the law and the aspirations of people? The Constitution gives equal opportunities to all. But this decision has disappointed the entire nation.”
He, however, asked the leaders and workers to not panic and continue to fight hard.
He said the Constitution gave PTI the right to contest the election with its ‘bat’ symbol. He continued: “The Constitution empowers us to put our position and symbol in front of the people so the nation makes a decision.”
Mr Qaiser said PTI was registered with the Election Commission of Pakistan under the Constitution.
“The election commission is a neutral institution and its job is to conduct free and fair elections and give level playing field to all, but it has become a party against PTI.”

3,Key JUI-F Lakki leader joins Marwat Qaumi Ittehad,LAKKI MARWAT: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl received a major blow in the local electoral politics as one of its key...,"LAKKI MARWAT: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl received a major blow in the local electoral politics as one of its key leaders and prominent religious scholar, Mufti Abdul Ghani, parted ways with Maulana Fazlur Rehman and announced his support for Marwat Qaumi Ittehad (MQI) candidates in the Feb 8 polls. 
He made the announcement in the presence of former federal ministers Anwar Saifullah Khan and Salim Saifullah Khan, candidates for PK-107, Lakki Marwat-III, and NA-41, Lakki Marwat, respectively, in Islamabad on Sunday. 
On the occasion, a former union council nazim, Haji Bashir Khan of Hayatkhel and Pasham Khan and Habibur Rehman of Titterkhel also joined the group headed by Saifullah brothers. 
Salim Saifullah welcomed Mufti Ghani and his supporters into the fold of MQI and said their ‘wise’ decision would strengthen the candidates affiliated with the group. 
He said the alliance had been formed to remove backwardness of the district. He said people should vote for those candidates whose past was not tainted with corruption. 
He asked the people to send honest representatives to assemblies so they could steer the country out of crises and serve them in a better way. 
Mufti Ghani acknowledged the services of influential Saifullahs for development of the district. He assured Saifullah brothers of full support in the sole National Assembly and three provincial assembly constituencies in the coming elections. 
Mufti Abdul Ghani is an administrator of Jamia Halimia located in Darra Pezu town, and has a strong influence in the entire district. 
Though reasons behind his differences with Fazl are not in the light, many in the party found it difficult to digest the decision of JUI-F chief to field his son, Asjad Mehmood for NA-41. 
The district is considered to be a stronghold of JUI-F and a major vote bank always lured Fazl to put his family members in the polls arena. 
In the 2013 elections, Fazlur Rehman had won the national assembly seat from Lakki Marwat. He then vacated the seat, but his brother, Maulana Attaur Rehman could not retain it in be-elections as Amirullah Marwat of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had emerged as returned candidate with support of Saifullah brothers. 
In 2018 elections, Maulana Mohammad Anwar of JUI-F, who is a teacher in Jamia Halimia, had won the NA seat, defeating former district nazim Ishfaq Ahmad Khan Meenakhel, who was backed by PTI. 
SUPPORT PLEDGED: PTI Leaders and activists on Sunday pledged support for the party’s candidate for NA-39, Bannu, Maulana Naseem Ali Shah and said other aspirants of the party would withdraw from the poll race in his favour. 
At a meeting held in Bannu city on Sunday, they said they would launch an enthusiastic campaign for the religious leader to ensure his victory in the Feb 8 polls. 
An insider said Malik Zafar Hayat and Malik Shakil had convened the meeting to forge consensus among local leaders and get their support for Maulana Naseem Shah. 
The participants said despite the state ‘highhandedness’, PTI leaders and activists still reposed full confidence in the leadership of Imran Khan and they would utilise all energies to muster support for the party’s candidates. 
They said Maulana Naseem was a consensus candidate for the NA constituency and his rival candidates would be expelled from the election arena with power of vote.

Mr Wazir has joined Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-Parliamentarians and is the party’s candidate for PK-103. 
The Uthmanzai jirga elders of Shewah tehsil of North Waziristan said that the former provincial minister for relief and resettlement had violated the jirga traditions by not participating in a protest to press the government for acceptance of their demands for peace and bringing an end to target killings.  
The jirga leaders said that the former minister had been warned several times to attend the jirga and clear his position about charges levelled against him, but to no avail. 
It merits a mention here that Uthmanzai tribes have been protesting for last seven months to force the government to accept their demands, including restoration of peace, bringing an end to target killings and asking the security forces to vacate seminaries.  
The jirga had asked the former minister to support them in their protest campaign against the government. However, he was hesitant to participate in their protest. Therefore, the jirga had decided to impose penalty on him for violating jirga traditions. 
The jirga had initially imposed Rs5 million fine on him and also torched his two vehicles, but later on the request of Kabalkhel tribe, the jirga decreased the penalty to Rs2m.

He said that earlier they formed coalition with JUI-F and decided that PML-N would not issue ticket for National Assembly seat in the district, NA-13, and PK-34 to its workers and would support JUI-F candidates in both the constituencies.
He said that JUI-F also withdraw its candidate and decided to support PML-N candidate for PK-35. He added that all matters were settled down with consent of elders of both the parties.
Mr Khan said that suddenly retired Capt Safdar visited Battagram and issued party tickets to Sardar Moeen and Adil Nawaz Khan for both the seats without considering ground realities of politics in the district. He said that after such decisions, it was not possible for him to carry on with PML-N. He quit PML-N and joined JUI-F.
He said that their family was famous for loyalty in local politics and they never gave up fulfilling commitments. Nawabzada Wali was a strong candidate of PML-N and could possibly win the seat.

12,Jamaat won’t allow delay in polls: Sen Mushtaq,LOWER DIR: Jamaat-i-Islami Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan has urged the Election Commission of Pakistan and the Supreme...,"LOWER DIR: Jamaat-i-Islami Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan has urged the Election Commission of Pakistan and the Supreme Court to provide level playing field to all the political parties, ensure the general elections are held on the scheduled date and ‘avoid depriving’ Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf of its election symbol. 
He was addressing a party workers’ convention in Talash here the other day.   JI Youth Wing Talash chapter organised the event. 
JI candidate for NA-7 Maulana Dr Mohammad Ismail, PK-16 candidate Shad Nawaz Khan, former tehsil nazim Riaz Mohammad, JI Youth Wing district president Ateequr Rehman, JI tehsil emir Malik Sher Bahadar and others also spoke on the occasion. 
Realising the importance of youth vote, Senator Mushtaq said 130 million youth would decide the country’s direction in the Feb 8 elections. 
He asked the JI Youth Wing to mobilise youngsters and women to vote for party. He said if voted to power, the JI would provide education to every child, healthcare to every citizen and would distribute national resources equally among the provinces.  
The Jamaat leader said his party won’t allow anyone to delay elections on any pretext.  
Senator Mushtaq condemned the arrest of Pakhtun Tahaffuz Movement chief Manzoor Pashteen and termed it illegal and unconstitutional. The JI chief also condemned the ‘forced disappearance’ of Baloch people. 
He said the JI had been struggling for the enforcement of Islamic system through ballot in the country that guaranteed equal facilities of education, healthcare and shelter to citizens and ensured justice to all irrespective of people’s social and economic status. 
He said the Islamic system would rid Pakistan of ‘slavery’ of IMF, World Bank and the US. He said the JI wanted across the board accountability of the judges, generals and bureaucrats. He alleged rulers had looted national wealth and shifted it abroad. He said JI would take into account all the elements involved in plundering the national wealth. 
Talking about the justice system, the JI senator said 2.1 million cases were pending in courts. He alleged the country was being ruled by ‘mafias’ that had roots in parliament and judiciary. 
“Some individuals and political parties want to postpone the election in the garb of militancy, but the JI won’t let it happen,” Mushtaq said, adding delaying polls was tantamount to surrendering before the militants. 
The JI senator said prices of daily use items were increasing on weekly basis, while millions of educated youth were jobless. 
The JI senator was of the view that free, fair and transparent elections were the only solution to all problems faced by the nation. He said depriving a political party of its election symbol and arresting its candidates was not fair.

13,SCCI chief seeks immediate resolution of gas shortage issue,PESHAWAR: Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Fuad Ishaq has expressed grave concerns over increasing...,"PESHAWAR: Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Fuad Ishaq has expressed grave concerns over increasing environmental pollution as people use alternative sources of fuel owing to low gas pressure issue.
He urged the caretaker chief minister, governor, chief secretary and district administration to contact federal caretaker government immediately and resolve the issues once for all.
According to a press release, Mr Ishaq held a meeting with the additional deputy commissioner, Sania Safi, in her office here on Sunday. The presidents of city bazaars, trader leaders and members of business community were present in a large number in the meeting.
He told the additional deputy commissioner that SCCI had taken up the issue of low gas pressure with federal government and relevant ministry in an efficient way because Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was treated in an unjust way.
The SCCI chief said people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were compelled to use traditional ways as alternative sources of fuel for fulfillment of requirements of routine life. “Traditional methods like use of timber, coal and other sources are causing an increase in environment pollution, which can cause lungs and respiratory diseases,” he added.
He said that the total gas production of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was 550 MMCFDs whereas gas consumption in the province was 200MMCFDs. He said that the rest of 350MMCFDs gas was given to national grid. If the 200MMCFDs gas was fully supplied to the province, the issues would be resolved, he added.
Mr Ishaq said that resolution of gas issue would remove tension of people along with the wheel of business and industries would continue to run. He added that people would also avail employment opportunities in the province if the issue was resolved.
He said that KP was put into the basket of RLNG while subsidy was given to Punjab. In KP, 3900MMBTU gas was supplied to commercial consumers and 2700MMBTU to industrial consumers while fertiliser sector was provided gas at low cost in Punjab, he added. 
He said that the weighted average cost of gas (WACOG) policy should be determined at provincial level.

14,KMU associate professor serves legal notice on KMC dean,Seeks public apology for using ‘objectionable’ language against her,"PESHAWAR: An associate professor of Khyber Medical University has served a legal notice on the principal/dean Khyber Medical College (KMC), asking him to tender unconditional apology within 14 days for using ‘highly inappropriate and objectionable’ language against her at an official meeting.
The legal notice was served by Dr Brekhna Jameel, who is director/associate professor (BPS-20) Institute of health Professions Education and Research, KMU, through a senior lawyer Neelam A Khan on the KMC’s Dean Prof Dr Mahmud Auragnzeb.
The legal action is in response to alleged defamation arising from ‘inappropriate language and false accusations’ leveled during a meeting on Jan 10.
Dr Jameel, who is also president of Khyber Medical University (KMU) Employees Union, contends that Dean Mahmud Aurangzeb, in his official capacity, used ‘highly objectionable’ language and engaged in inappropriate actions, such as creating caricatures and insinuating misconduct against her.
She claims that these actions have caused significant harm to both her personal and professional reputation.

Seeks public apology for using ‘objectionable’ language against her

In the notice the lawyer Neelam A Khan, who is also senior vice president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, has asked the dean that her client would initiate both civil and criminal proceedings against him if he failed to tender proper/ unconditional apology, circulate it on social media as well as in four leading newspapers.
It is added that the civil proceedings would be initiated for recovery of damages to the tune of two billion rupees.
The notice states that Dr Jameel had more than 15 years of academic, research and administrative experience in health professions education and research and had published more than 50 research articles in reputed journals.
It states that she has established the Institute of Health Professions Education and Research at KMU, which is well reputed across the country for faculty development programs.
It is added that the transcript of the meeting held on Jan 10 at Khyber Teaching Hospital’s auditorium called by the hospital medical director was attended by faculty members and administrative staff of KMC, Khyber College of Dentistry and KTH.
It is stated that the language used by the dean against her was unbecoming of a senior officer.
The notice emphasizes on the severity of the allegations, asserting that they have inflicted irreparable damage to Dr Jameel’s pristine record.
As an accomplished professional and President of the KMU Employees Association, she underscores the potential far-reaching consequences within the societal context.
Dr Jameel reiterates her unwavering commitment to the noble profession of teaching while highlighting the urgency to rectify the harm caused by Dean Aurangzeb’s actions.
