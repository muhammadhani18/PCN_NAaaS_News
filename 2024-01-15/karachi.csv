0,Six more test positive for Covid at Karachi airport,"Two passengers hail from Mingora, while remaining four belong to Ghotki, Rahim Yar Khan, Charsadda and Jacobabad.","KARACHI: Six more passengers have tested positive for Covid-19 upon their return at the Jinnah International Airport from Saudi Arabia, the provincial health department said on Sunday.
Two passengers hailed from Mingora, while remaining four belonged to Ghotki, Rahim Yar Khan, Charsadda and Jacobabad.
“They were selected for the Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) because they had flu-like symptoms,” a health department spokesperson said, adding that the passengers were allowed to leave for their area of residence after being advised to self-quarantine.
Since Jan 5, as many as 15 international travellers, most of them arriving from Saudi Arabia, have tested positive for Covid-19 at the Karachi airport. Their detailed laboratory tests for the infection also came positive.
However, only two of the passengers have tested positive for JN.1 — a highly contagious variant of Covid-19 currently a cause of concern in several countries. The variant has spread to over 40 countries and is categorised by the WHO as a ‘variant of interest’.
In recent days, five locally transmitted cases of the variant have been detected by the Aga Khan University Hospital. The patients, three of them women, had no recent history of travel.

1,Thousands join JI rally for Gaza on 100 days of Israeli atrocities,Hafiz Naeem says the Muslim world should have offered all available resources and its military might to Palestinians.,"KARACHI: The Jamaat­-i-Islami staged a massive rally — Gaza Million March — on Sharea Faisal on Sunday to mark the completion of 100 days of Israeli brutalities against innocent people of Palestine.
A large number of people, including women and children, came to Sharea Faisal from different parts of the city in cars, motorbikes, buses, etc, to participate in the rally.
Chanting slogans and carrying banners and placards, the participants joined the key point of the march near the Nursery bus stop.
Speaking to the participants of the rally over the phone, JI chief Sirajul Haq said that unfortunately the leaders of the Muslim world played a negative role and opted to keep mum and remained static over the issue of Gaza due to the pressure of Israel and the United States.
He said that the Muslim world should have offered all available resources and its military might to Palestinians and Hamas against Israel.
The JI leader lamented that the Muslim world had strong armies, all types of tanks, warships, missiles and other weaponry, including nukes, but it did nothing for Palestinians.
Asking the people to reject what he called coward leaders, he urged the people to vote and support in the Feb 8 elections those candidates who have the ability to represent them. 
Speaking on the occasion, JI-Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman stressed the need to take all possible measures in everyone’s individual capacity to support Palest­­­inians against Israeli occupation.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Netan­yahu enjoyed the support of not only the US, the United Kingdom and European countries but also a silent support of many Islamic countries.
He also hailed the role of South Africa for moving the International Court of Justice against Israel with genocide charges. He said that someone from the Muslim world should have come forward in this regard but unfortunately it was not the case.
He also paid a rich tribute to Houthi regime in Yemen for supporting Hamas against the occupation forces of Israel.
On the occasion, he highlighted that the boycott of Israeli products was a very strong initiative but it was incomplete without promoting local brands. 
In this regard, he said, Alkhidmat and the Pakistan Business Forum were going to launch a ‘Mera Brand Pakistan’ initiative on Jan 20 and 21. 
Allama Hassan Zaffar Naqvi, Allama Baqir Abbas Zaidi, former Karachi administrator Fahim Zaman, Advocate Younous Sohan and Shakeel Ahmed of Islami Jamiat Talaba also addressed the march.

5,Beleaguered PTI launches election campaign with Karachi Seaview rally,Hundreds of activists and supporters gather at the venue despite blockades.,"• Hundreds of activists and supporters gather at the venue despite blockades
• Workers interrupted Sher Marwat’s speech, claimed irregularities in party ticket distribution
• Party spokesperson claims police picked up many workers in Safoora
KARACHI: In the face of challenges after losing its iconic poll symbol ‘bat’ following a Supreme Court ruling that also rendered hundreds of its election candidates independent, the beleaguered Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf on Sunday launched its election campaign in Karachi where its senior vice president Sher Afzal Marwat vowed to build the momentum for polls and stage a rally in Hyderabad on Monday (today).
Addressing the hundreds of party workers, who reached the venue after crossing all blockades and hurdles erected by authorities and local administration without mentioning any particular reason, the PTI leader said the city chapter of the party had proved that “despite harassment, abduction and operation, it would clean sweep the Feb 8 elections in the city and across the country”.
The workers of the PTI, which had announced the rally a couple of days ago, met with surprise on Sunday morning when they were denied access to Seaview as roads leading to their destination were blocked by the authorities, who had put containers on thoroughfares and parked buses, trucks and water bowsers in the middle of roads to stop people from participating in the rally.
 






A PTI spokesperson blamed the police authorities and the caretaker administration of deliberately harassing party workers and depriving them of their constitutional right of staging political activities, adding that other parties were freely driving their election campaigns without any fear.
On Sunday morning, a large number of PTI workers, including women and children, reached Seaview after crossing the hurdles and blockades to welcome Advocate Marwat in a charged atmosphere.
“We have launched our campaign today as we are not giving up despite the fact that our symbol has been snatched from us illegally,” Mr Marwat said.
“We are holding a rally in Hyderabad tomorrow and now it is your duty [PTI workers] to reach out every single voter and help them understand the new dynamics. Help them understand the situation as new and separate symbols have been allotted to our candidates and make sure that they vote for the skipper [Imran Khan],” he said.
He claimed after every few days PTI workers were picked up by police and many were facing false charges only for campaigning for party candidates.
“The situation is turning worst with each passing day as every day we hear about our workers and their illegal detention. This must stop now, “ he said, adding:  “I salute PTI Karachi workers. You have really proved today that no one can defeat you, your party and your skipper. So keep your spirits high and don’t give up.”
Workers raise complaints

During his address, dozens of PTI workers also started chanting slogans and interrupted him and complained about ‘irregularities’ in distribution of party tickets in Karachi for the Feb 8 elections.
Advocate Marwat calmed them down and said that he ‘agreed’ with their grievances and would convey their concerns to the top leadership.
However, Mr Marwat appealed to them to keep these issues aside and keep their focus on ‘big day of Feb 8’.
Later in the evening, police allegedly detained some PTI workers and laid a siege to the residence of party’s Karachi general secretary Rehman Mahesar in Safoora to disrupt a workers’ convention.
PTI-Karachi spokesperson Falak Almas said party leader Sher Afzal Marwat was supposed to address the workers’ convention, but heavy police contingents already deployed there ‘detained’ scores of the workers.
However, East SSP Syed Irfan Bahadur denied the arrest of any PTI workers.

6,Flower show provides whiff of fresh air to visitors,Marigold Festival concludes,"

KARACHI: The 4th Marigold Festival, an annual occurrence now organised by the parks department of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, which was under way at Bagh-i-Jinnah (Frere Hall lawns) since Friday, came to its conclusion on Sunday.
It being a holiday, saw a large number of folks from all walks of life coming to appreciate the pretty, yellow, 
orange and pale flowers of different sizes.
Eleven-year-old Suhana from Larkana liked marigolds so much that she arrived wearing a bright yellow shalwar kameez to blend in with the flowers.
Mohammed Asghar from around the Cantonment Railway Station had made all four of his kids, Faiza, Maryam, Zoya and Zain, sit against the backdrop of the blooming flowers as he took their pictures from his mobile phone to share with his better half later. And where was she?
“There was no space for her on my motorbike with all the children so she didn’t come. The children’s outing is more important,” he smiled.

Marigold Festival concludes

Murtaza Ali and Raana were there with their three-month old baby Altamash, who was dozing in his mama’s arms. “He is little but we can tell that even he felt happy and relaxed amid nature’s beauties. He fell asleep smiling,” said Raana.
Two little girls, Tafarrus and Tashfeen, were also there with their mother Nausheen and father Zahid. The family said they had actually come to Frere Hall to explore the old books bazaar, but then realised that there was a marigold festival going on too.
Associate Professor of Surgery at Dow University of Health Sciences Dr Akram Rajput and Mrs Abida Rajput said that they had been waiting for this festival. “It always happens at around this time of year. Just last week, we came here, hoping to catch this festival but went back a little disappointed,” said Dr Rajput.
“But today we just happened to pass from here to find it happening finally. We stopped immediately, dropping everything else. We also called our children at home to join us here,” said Mrs Rajput.
The strings and plastic lines pulled around the different formations and arrangements of marigold flower pots to keep folks from getting to close to the flowers for comfort by the organisers had, on the final day, fallen or broken at most places for trespassers to settle down for little picnic parties near them. There were children playing football with beach balls, some bought from vendors right there in the garden.
One also ran into some foreigners there. Jan, Oli, Caro and Luca from Germany and France said that they loved the various shades of the flower. They also said that they were enjoying the Karachi weather, which was neither too hot, nor too cold.

The driver was also injured when his vehicle overturned after hitting the gangsters. 
A team from the Dera Sarki police station proceeded to the spot after receiving information about the episode but the gang had already escape with the body of its one member and three injured ones. 
Sources in the area said that there were more than 20 dacoits lined up along the road in small groups to waylay passing vehicles with intention to loot the commuters. One of the groups standing at Saifal bus stop – where commuters are looted on every second day -- started firing on the mini-truck to intercept it but the driver, sensing danger, over ran the gang leaving two of the outlaws dead and three others injured. However, he lost control over the steering which caused the vehicle to overturn at some distance ahead. 
Tangwani DSP Anwar Hussain Gopang and Dera Sarki SHO Zulfiqar Jatoi along with a strong police team proceeded to the scene and challenged the gang. An encounter ensued but the gang sped away with the body of its one associate and the injured ones, leaving one deceased dacoits at the site.

10,Nationalist leaders at HLF defend role in parliamentary politics,"Qadir Magsi, Ayaz Palijo see G.M. Syed’s ideology gaining ground","

STP Chairman Dr Qadir Magsi (right) and QAT chief Ayaz Latif Palijo share their views with audience in a session at Hyderabad Literature Festival.—Dawn

 
HYDERABAD: The role of Sindhi nationalist entities in parliamentary politics was discussed threadbare Dr Qadir Magsi, head of the Sindh Taraqqi-pasand Party (STP), and Ayaz Latif Palijo, chief of the Qaumi Awami Tehreek (QAT), at one of the sessions held during the two-day Hyderabad Literature Festival (HLF) that concluded at the Sindh Museum on Sunday.
The two leaders observed that parliamentary politics in Sindh had been a ‘social club’ of feudal lords for the last past 75 years. 
“Nationalist leaders like us could not change this political landscape alone but we still hope that parliamentary politics of nationalists now seem to be gaining ground,” they said.
The session was moderated by Manzoor Shaikh.
“People often question why nationalists failed in parliamentary politics. But nobody discusses [that how] G.M. Syed was elected before Pakistan’s inception. Hyder Bux Jatoi opted for electoral path; Imdad Shah and Syed Jalal Mahmood Shah were also part of assemblies. Then G.M. Syed and Hyder Bux Jatoi lost [in elections],” argued Dr Magsi. 

Qadir Magsi, Ayaz Palijo see G.M. Syed’s ideology gaining ground

He said that two kinds of Sindh’s nationalist politics used to be seen in the past – pure patriotism before 70s; and ideological nationalist politics that started in the post-70 period. “It’s instilled in people’s minds that politics is a wadera shahi’s job,” he said, recalling that he never opted for parliamentary politics till 90s only to leave the field open for waderas (feudal lords). 
“But now people are showing activism and I hope prospects of parliamentary politics for nationalists will improve,” he believed.
“Our educated class has become opportunists. We [Sindhi nationalists] resisted Gen Yahya’s Martial Law,” he said, and remarked: “Qadir Magsi, Ayaz Latif or Jalal Shah alone can’t change Sindh”.
He observed that election expenses at the minimum side were around Rs10m and a wadera of Sindh spends Rs250m to Rs300m on his electioneering. “This we simply can’t afford,” he argued. “If Sindh’s intelligentsia agrees, then over 100 potential candidates could be fielded in Sindh but, unfortunately, there are only three leaders amongst us [nationalists] to fill 130 general seats of Sindh Assembly,” he regretted. 
The STP chief believed that a pro-motherland Sindh individual could not be supporter of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). He deplored the fact that only failure of nationalist politics was discussed but its successes ignored. 
“This time governor and caretaker CM are Urdu-speaking people. I wonder where is Sindh’s conscience,” he remarked.
BISP aimed at buying women vote: Palijo
Ayaz Latif Palijo observed that Sindh did not have democracy, and pointed out that the province had been outsourced. Alluding to Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) stipend for women, he said nowhere in the world women were given Rs3,000 each a month for her vote. “Democracy remains missing in our system and decisions about rulers are taken somewhere else instead of merit,” he said. 
“History tells people who did like [PPP founder] Z.A. Bhutto five-six years before he was given the reign of government … after 2018 polls, PTI was chosen for the top government slot; and now PML-N is being given powers … in lieu of it, PPP is being given powers in Sindh,” Palijo claimed.
Whenever people of Sindh would throng polling stations, this would bring the system for rigging to an end. “People used to say if nationalists forge unity, PPP will be wiped out and we three leaders are fighting against PPP, they ask us for alternative narrative,” he said, adding that these elements only needed excuses. 
Session on ‘Police and public’
At another session, on ‘Police and public’, former Sindh inspector general Dr Syed Kaleem Imam discussed how society and policing could be changed. He discussed his own book, Kotwalnama (a collection of his essays.
The session was moderated by journalist Fahim Siddiqui. Police officers including Zulfikar Larik, Amjad Shaikh (a recipient of Tamgha-i-Shujaat) and Suhaee Aziz shared their views. 
Dr Imam said that people tend to criticise police “but if an ad appears in newspapers for police jobs, most of audience will be ready to apply for it”. He stressed that people also needed to change themselves, first of all. 
He observed that in Japan, a child is imparted education about how to be a civilised citizen before he or she gets formal education. 
Amjad Shaikh conceded that ‘political bosses’ needed to change themselves because political interference was there. 
He said Dr Imam had asked SSPs to ensure that SHOs were appointed on a merit basis and with tenure security, and argued: “But political interference is not negative all the time. We can take political influence in different context and we can’t be immune to political influence as a chief minister is a political figure and he has a legal say in transfer and postings. “We can take public input to make political bosses behave,” he asserted.
Zulfiqar Larik said police needed to be reshaped for ‘service delivery’ and for this we need to change colonial laws to bring laws in conformity with present conditions. He said accessibility needed to be ensured in Sindh’s riverine area where things remained difficult.
Suhaee Aziz said there were taboos about women working in police but, yes, society did object to it. “Problem lies in society and not with police where environment is sound,” she said, and added that traffic policewomen wanted posting in offices and resist duty on roads.

He said the festival ‘on a grand scale’ would be held in the Public School, Latifabad. 
The PLF, earlier, had been held in Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Sukkur, he recalled.
Mr Shah said that many literary giants, like Anwar Maqsood, Iftikhar Arif and Peerzada Qasim, would be taking part in the Hyderabad PLF.
He said that after restoration of peace in ethnic riots-torn Karachi, he and his colleagues in the Arts Council of the city started literary events like International Urdu Conference and literary festivals. 
“We can connect people through Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai, Shaikh Ayaz and Ibrahim Joyo,” he said, adding that the cultural and literary events are the first line of defence against terrorism. 
“We organised PLF in Sukkur and we are committed to hold such festivals at district level across Sindh,” he said.
The minister described Sufi saints and literary figures as “reformers and revolutionaries”, and stressed that the glorious past of Sindh’s rich culture and civilisation must be revived.
He said that hatred and violence could be eliminated through cultural activities and gatherings because culture and literature were more powerful than political power.
