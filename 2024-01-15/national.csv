1,No bilateral trade via Torkham for second day,Customs clearing agents demand relaxation in visa restrictions.,"KHYBER: With officials of Pakistan and Afghanistan failing to reach an understanding regarding the visa restrictions on transporters of both countries, bilateral trade between the two neighbouring countries via the Torkham border remained suspended for a second consecutive day on Sunday.
Sources at Torkham told Dawn that no headway was made in a meeting held between the border officials of the two countries late on Saturday evening.
They, however, agreed to convey the messages from each side to their respective high authorities.
Not a single vehicle has been allowed to cross the border into Afghanistan or enter Pakistan since Saturday, though pedestrian movement was not restricted, sources said.

Customs clearing agents demand relaxation in visa restrictions

It was also learnt from local fruit dealers that the customs officials at Torkham ‘advised’ them to take their merchandise back to Peshawar for safe storage as there was no immediate solution in sight of the visa issue.
 
 

On Saturday, Pakistan imposed visa restrictions on all those Afghan drivers and their helpers who were without legal travel documents and were barred from entering Pakistan.
The Afghan Taliban authorities deputed on their side of the Torkham border, also reciprocated in the same vein by refusing entry to all the Pakistani transporters into their country.
Besides, bilateral trade at Kharlaachi border crossing in Kurram came to a standstill after the Afghan authorities refused Pakistani drivers entry into their country at Kharlaachi on Sunday morning, some local importers at Torkham informed Dawn.
Demanding relaxation in visa restrictions for Afghan transporters, the Torkham Custom Clearing Agents Association has said the restrictions incurred financial losses to local traders and transporters.
President of the association Aimal Shinwari said that fruit and vegetable exporters were at risk of inflicting huge loses as the edible items were prone to perish if not delivered on time.
He said that the national exchequer, too, was losing millions of dollars on a daily basis after the customs clearance of both the import and export items was completely stopped due to the new visa restrictions.
The sudden imposition of the restrictions caused traffic congestion at the border point on both sides, as the majority of drivers and their assistants could not present valid travel documents.
Sabir Khan, a local customs clearing agent, said that with fruit imp­orts from Afghanistan com­ing to an end due to winter, the export of Pak­i­s­tani goods had incr­eased, leading to a traffic rush from the Pakistan side.
He mentioned that Afg­han border authorities had also stopped some Pak­is­tani drivers from entering Afghanistan after the sudden implementation of visa restrictions on Afghan dri­vers by the Pakistan government.
Mr Khan further stated that hundreds of trailers and containers loaded with Pakistani export goods, including cement, tractors, other agricultural tools, vegetables, oranges, and miscellaneous items, were stranded on the Pakistan side, causing hardships for the transporters.
It was also learnt that customs and security officials were in constant touch with high-ups in Islamabad for the early settlement of the visa issue for Afghan transporters.
Customs officials emphasised that with exports from Pakistan flowing at a high rate, they could not afford any delay in the customs clearance of goods already arrived at the Torkham border.

6,Literary Notes: Bibliographic works that capture essence of three giants,THE biggest problem that new researchers face is finding sources on the topic of their research. Some start with...,"THE biggest problem that new researchers face is finding sources on the topic of their research. Some start with going to primary sources and then secondary ones. But this is a cumbersome and time-consuming process and unreliable too. Despite going through mountains of books and articles, new researchers are not sure if they have combed every possible venue where the source material is expected to be found.
The solution to this problem is a work that lists all the sources on a specific topic in the form of citations. Such works are usually called enumerative bibliographies. Researchers and students are, of course, aware of a bibliography that is appended at the end of their research papers or dissertations, citing all the sources used in that particular research work. But an enumerative bibliography is one that lists all the primary and secondary sources on a specific topic or a discipline.
Such bibliographic works are a boon for researchers as they save them a lot of time and energy. What perturbs one, however, is that there are not as many enumerative bibliographic works in Urdu as one would have wished for. The National Language Promotion Department (NLPD) at Islamabad, formerly the National Language Authority (NLA), and some other organisations had begun publishing bibliographies in Urdu on different topics, especially related to Urdu literature. Somehow the work was hampered and publication of bibliographies came to almost a standstill, but now the NLPD has published three bibliographies that list sources on three giants of Urdu literature, namely, Mirza Ghalib, Shibli No’mani and Qazi Abdul Wadood.
Dr Suhail Abbas Khan, the compiler of these bibliographies, has explained what a bibliography may or should contain. He says if someone intends to compile an enumerative bibliography of, say, Mir Taqi Mir, they should include the information on the books written by Mir, including prose and poetry in Urdu and Persian; books written on Mir; articles/essays on Mir published in magazines as well as the ones included in anthologies; special issues of magazines on Mir, dissertations in universities written on Mir for award of a degree and any other pieces of information on Mir, most probably scattered in books. The bibliography should cite a book’s complete bibliographic info, such as author, publisher, place and date of publication, pages, the contents and a brief critical evaluation.
Suhail Abbas, a researcher himself, says a bibliography is such a useful tool that it can help carry out new research and even enhance the standard of research. The three bibliographies compiled by him and published by NLPD are:
Shuruh-i-Ghalib: kitabiyaat
This is a bibliography of commentaries on Mirza Ghalib’s Urdu poetry. Ghalib is the poet whose Urdu poetry has inspired the most commentaries in Urdu. Suhail Abbas says a PhD dissertation written on Ghalib’s commentaries mentions just 64 such works, while in fact the published commentaries on Ghalib’s Urdu poetry are well over 100. He has listed 107 such commentaries with bibliographic details, but two earliest commentaries remain unknown as Shadan Bilgirami, while mentioning them, has not given their details, except for one’s name: Cheestan-i-Ghalib, says Suhail Abbas. Aside from them, Chahar Chaman is the earliest commentary on Ghalib’s Urdu poetry, penned in 1876 by Durga Prashad Nadir Dehlvi.
Interestingly, the book also lists a ‘sharh’, or commentary, written in Avadhi, one in Marathi and five commentaries in Hindi on Ghalib’s Urdu poetry.
Shibli No’mani: kitabiyaat
Another bibliography compiled by Suhail Abbas is that of Shibli No’mani, the scholar, poet, historian, critic and poet. It lists books and articles written by Shibli, lectures delivered by him, books and articles written on Shibli and dissertations written on Shibli at universities. Anyone who intends to do some research on Shibli or write something on him must have this bibliography.
Qazi Abdul Wadood: kitabiyaat
Qazi Abdul Wadood was a critic and researcher ranked among Urdu’s best ones. He was a critic who would not spare anybody. Qazi Sahib has criticised even senior scholars such as Muhammad Husain Azad and Moulvi Abdul Haq on certain issues. This bibliography, compiled by Suhail Abbas and published by the NLPD, documents works by Qazi Abdul Wadood.
It would not be out of place to mention here that in India, at least three indexes of Qazi Abdul Wadood’s works have been published, one co-authored by Muhammad Zaki and Mansoor Alam, another by Jameel Ahmed and the third one, most comprehensive, by Dr Ata Khursheed. Since books published in India are generally not available in Pakistan, some citations are missing from this bibliography.
Apparently slim volumes, these books are invaluable as they encapsulate the essential works on three giants of Urdu literature.

7,"Election, PTI case discussed at ThinkFest",Interim minister Solangi says polls will certainly be held and it has been his consistent opinion since the formation of the caretaker government.,"LAHORE: As the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) faced a setback after the decision of the Supreme Court and there is still uncertainty about the upcoming election, a session at the Afkar-e-Taza ThinkFest discussed the political situation in the country on Sunday.
The session, titled Facing the popular will: Election 2024, had veteran politician Afrasiab Khattak, journalist Hamid Mir and caretaker minister for information and broadcasting Murtaza Solangi as panelists while it was moderated by Tamkinet Karim.
To the question whether the election will be held on Feb 8, Khattak said there was uncertainty about it and one should see the elephant in the room. He added the army generals who were ruling the country didn’t want any election or they wanted prolong the process at least.
Hamid Mir agreed with Khattak, saying the powerful circles wanted to delay the election on the lame excuse of the law and order situation.
“They want ‘somebody’ to be completely disqualified before the election so that he might not get any relief. However, after yesterday’s decision of Qazi Sahib (Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa), they (powerful circles) would review their earlier opinion and there is less chance now of the election being delayed”. He was referring to the ban on the bat as the election symbol of the PTI.
Mir predicted that if election would be held on Feb 8, the government would be formed as per the desire of the powers that be and that government would be pushed to enter an agreement like the “Tashkent agreement,” which would be opposed by the masses as well as all political parties, resulting in a movement against the government (and its dissolution).
Solangi said the polls would certainly be held and it had been his consistent opinion since the formation of the caretaker government.
Regarding the SC decision, Khattak said the decision was a political one but it had been given legal cover.
Tamkinet said the election should be free and fair as well. She asked which party had got the level-playing field at the moment while there were also killing fields in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. To this, Khattak reminded the audience that only the 1970 general election was fair which was not accepted by the army generals because Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s party had won it. After that Gen Zia had taken the stance that the election should be held only when positive results would be certain and since then the same policy was being followed.
Regarding the level-playing field, he said no party had it as all the parties were trying to get the vote of the GHQ instead of the masses.
Mir said the SC decision had exposed the party that had got the ‘level-playing field’ and that party whose leadership was in Lahore had got the privilege. He added that for a similar breach of election rules (intra-party election), the ANP was fined just Rs20,000 while it was allowed to run the election on its symbol of Laltain.
Mir said CJ Qazi Faez Isa should have stayed away from the case as a reference was filed against him during the PTI government. He said the PML-N and Justice Isa were on the same page while adding that Faisal Vawda had declared Isa’s verdict one month ago.
When Solangi termed the SC decision “very good”, he was booed by the audience and elicited laughter when he said a legal precedent had been set to force the parties to ensure intra-party election.
Hamid Mir said if the polling turnout went above 50pc or reached 60pc, the results would subvert the plans of the establishment. He said there was resistance in Punjab also now while earlier it was only in Balochistan or Sindh or KP.
Regarding terrorism and law and order situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Khattak said terrorism was not spontaneous and it was only state agencies tactics of political engineering and they themselves claimed that the Taliban were not a danger but only Pashtun and Baloch nationalists.
“Terrorism is a new way of political engineering. For example, Mohsin Dawar’s car has been attacked because he talks of democracy and national and political rights.”
When asked by Tamkinet that Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s party was also being attacked by terrorists, Khattak said Fazl’s part was being attacked only in Bajaur because Daesh had its centre in the neighbourhood of Bajaur. “Daesh attacks Fazl because it thinks that he supports the Taliban and Daesh is against them.”
Regarding Balochistan, Khattak said there was a democratic progressive movement in Balochistan but BAP (Balochistan Awami Party) had been formed there. He said Senate was supposed to be the house of federation but it had been turned into ‘the house of conspiracies’. When I was the chairperson of the human rights committee from 2009 to 2015, there were complaints of disappearances and we found out that ISI played a major role in disappearances. The committee decided to make a law in this regard but the agencies decided to control the Senate and the Sanjrani formula was introduced to stop the passage of such laws.
To a question, Hamid Mir said the Baloch women protesters were badly treated and arrested in Islamabad and the government tried to “deport” them from the federal capital like illegal immigrants. However, the local population supported them as against the state institutions. Saying that Baloch women protesters were heart-broken, he added that women in Balochistan were more radicalised compared to their men.
“I don’t see as much hatred among the Bengalis when I go there as I see in Baloch people,” he revealed.
Khattak narrated an incident that he was a part of the commission formed by Justice Athar Minallah to look into grievances of Baloch students. “When we visited the Balochistan University there were few students in the hall to attend the session but surprisingly after sometime thousands of students appeared.” He said a senator from Quetta told him that Baloch girls and boys did not want to attend the Pakistan national anthem at the start of the event. “I saw what I had seen in Dhaka University in 1971,” Khattak said, terming the forced disappearances state terrorism.
