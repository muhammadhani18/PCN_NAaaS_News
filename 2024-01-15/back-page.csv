0,Bilawal pledges ‘genuine’ rule of masses,"Promises to address unemployment, inflation, and terrorism; vows to end politics of hatred, solve missing persons’ issue.","SUKKUR / DERA MURAD JAMALI / QUETTA: PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed the hope on Sunday that PPP would win general elections and form the government, with the prime minister and four chief ministers being jiyalas.
Addressing a large gathering in Khairpur, the PPP chairman asserted that his government would mark the beginning of genuine “awami raj” (people’s rule) in the country.
During his address, Mr Bhutto-Zardari promised, “Our allies have betrayed us; secure a victory with an overwhelming majority, and I will change your destiny.”
 






Mr Bhutto-Zardari administered the oath to the party’s nominees for the national and provincial assembly, including senior leaders like Syed Qaim Ali Shah, Khurshid Shah, and Nasir Hussain Shah, ensuring their commitment to not neglect the people of their respective constituencies under any circumstances and fulfil their responsibilities regarding progress and the welfare of public.

Promises to address unemployment, inflation, and terrorism; vows to end politics of hatred, solve missing persons’ issue

The PPP chairman emphasised that Pakistan is currently facing multiple challenges.
He highlighted that unemployment, inflation and poverty are reaching record levels, along with the resurgence of terrorism. He expressed the commitment that, upon assuming power, they would bury the politics of hatred and division forever.
He regretted that the politics of hatred and revenge practiced by old politicians have divided the entire society.
“We will not engage in politics of hatred, division, and revenge. Instead, we will solve problems by uniting everyone. Other parties lack ideology and a clear manifesto. The leaders are oblivious to people’s sufferings and only focus on how to evade jail,” he added.
 






Mr Bhutto-Zardari criticised PML-N’s stance, stating that there is a lack of funds for the betterment of people.
He vowed that his government would shut down the 17 ministries that have no right to remain in the centre after the 18th Amendment. The Rs300 billion spent on those ministries and Rs1,500 billion given in the form of subsidies to the elite will be invested for the development and welfare of people.
Issues of terrorism and missing persons
Earlier, in another public meeting in Dera Murad Jamali, he urged the voters to support his party in the upcoming elections, promising to resolve the issues of terrorism and missing persons.
 






“My brothers are protesting for the families of terrorism victims, and my sisters are protesting for missing persons. I can solve both problems,” he declared.
Criticising the PML-N, he said that if they came to power, Balochistan would see no development in the next five years.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari asserted that the electoral symbol of “bat” is obsolete, and now a battle looms between the “arrow” (PPP) and the “lion” (PML-N).
He urged the nation to vote for the “arrow” while criticising PML-N leadership for hiding indoors.
“If a government is elected under my leadership, I will complete the Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline project and address the Kashmir issue,” he vowed.
According to him, the people of Pakistan are discontent with the rulers in Islamabad.
“A person who has served as prime minister three times is now being imposed for the fourth time, but people would not accept such a decision,” he warned.
If other parties came into power, he claimed they would favour the rich, leaving the poor to suffer. Conversely, a PPP government, according to him, would prioritise relief for the people.
“If you support the PPP, stamp the arrow on the ballot paper, I promise you that I will fully implement the 10-point election manifesto,” he assured. Expanding on his agenda, he pledged to double salaries as a top priority.
“I will not only increase your income; I will show it by doubling your salaries.
I will provide 300 units of electricity per month for free to poor families,“ he pledged.

1,Price hike looms as provinces reject Rs32bn urea subsidy burden,"Finance ministry also declines to share cost, citing IMF restrictions.","• Finance ministry also declines to share cost, citing IMF restrictions
• PM-led meeting decides to merge prices of imported and local urea, bill the extra cost to farmers
ISLAMABAD: With the headline inflation already touching 30 per cent, the country braces for a fertiliser price hike of about 5pc as provinces refuse to share a Rs32 billion burden for imported urea.
The Ministry of Finance also declined to share the subsidy burden, citing restrictions imposed under the IMF’s $3bn standby arrangement.
As a result, caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar had to withdraw centre’s decisions after the provincial chief ministers, except Sindh, declined at a recent meeting to finance their share of the subsidy.
Following a series of high-level meetings, including that of the federal cabinet and its relevant sub-committees as well as the all-powerful Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), it was finally decided to bill the extra cost to farmers through about a 4.5pc hike in urea prices by the local urea manufacturers.
This decision will likely cause an increase in food commodity prices as farmers pass on the additional costs to consumers. In reality, urea fertiliser is hardly available to local farmers and is being hoarded for higher rates.
The food and beverages group, which predominantly contains agricultural produce, has about 35-40pc weight in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket, which rose 29.7pc year-on-year for December. The food group also holds 25-26pc weight in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), which jumped 27pc last month.
Official records showed that the ECC had decided on Oct 23 that the provinces would subsidise 220,000 tonnes of imported urea. In another subsequent decision in November, the ECC once again decided that “cost recovery of the imported fertiliser will be made from the provinces”. Both decisions were rejected by the provinces except Sindh.
The Ministry of Industries and Production informed the federal government that provinces failed to shoulder the entire subsidy burden. This led to a landed cost of urea at Rs27.5bn, or Rs6,250 per bag, significantly higher than the local product priced between Rs3,800 and Rs4,140 per bag.
The National Fertiliser Marketing Ltd added another Rs4.92bn to the bill for incidental charges like storage, packing and transportation.
In a Jan 1 meeting chaired by the premier, the Finance Ministry flatly declined to extend any subsidy because of the IMF programme.
Therefore, the PM-led meeting decided that imported and local urea prices should be merged, and the price differential should be passed on to farmers.
 
 

A four-member committee comprising acting secretaries of petroleum, industries, food security and commerce was also formed to engage with urea manufacturers to implement the decision.
Under the new arrangement, urea manufacturers will acquire the imported urea, incorporating all related costs into the current prices over 12 months. They agreed to ensure price transparency until the imported stock is fully sold, with the government continuing efforts to provide gas to fertiliser plants and avoid further imports.

2,China warns against bids to ‘split apart’ its territory,"“Taiwan has never been a country. It wasn’t in the past, and it certainly won’t be in the future,” FM Wang Yi says.","BEIJING: China’s Fore­i­gn Minister Wang Yi has said Taiwan’s election, irrespective of its outcome, can never change the mere fact that there is only one China and Taiwan is a part of it.
“Taiwan has never been a country. It wasn’t in the past, and it certainly won’t be in the future,” Wang Yi said in a joint press conference with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry in Cairo.
Any effort to that end, Wang warned, “seriously threatens the well-being of Taiwan compatriots, seriously harms the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, and seriously jeopardises peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait region”.
Anyone trying to split apart China’s territory would be “harshly punished”, he warned, after the island chose Lai Ching-te, seen as a dangerous by ruling Communist Party, as president.
Beijing that claims Taiwan as its territory but has never renounced force to bring it under its control responded to Lai’s election by saying it would not change the “inevitable trend of China’s reunification”.

3,War on Gazans rages amid calls for ceasefire,"China, Egypt issue joint statement demanding truce, restoration of Palestinian statehood.","GAZA STRIP: Israeli tanks and aircraft hit areas in central and southern Gaza on Sunday, the 100th day of the ongoing aggression that has claimed a surging civilian death toll and ravaged the besieged Palestinian territory.
The conflict has created a dire humanitarian crisis for the 2.4 million people in Hamas-ruled Gaza, the United Nations and aid groups warn, and reduced much of the coastal strip to rubble. According to the health ministry in Gaza, at least 23,968 people have been killed, the majority of them women and children.
On the other hand, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi in a press conference with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the restoration of Palestinian statehood.
“It is necessary to insist on the establishment of an independent, fully sovereign state of Palestine on the 1967 borders, with east Jerusalem as its capital.”

China, Egypt issue joint statement demanding truce, restoration of Palestinian statehood

A joint statement from the two ministers urged an immediate end “to all acts of violence, killing and targeting of civilians and civilian establishments”.
Wang called for “an international summit for peace to find a just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause by ending the (Israeli) occupation and establishing an independent, contiguous Palestinian state.”
 






‘No one will stop us’
However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government has faced growing international pressure over civilian casualties in Gaza, vowed that “no one will stop us”.
After the International Court of Justice in The Hague heard arguments that accused Israel of breaching the UN Genocide Convention, Netanyahu insisted that Israel will “continue until victory”.
“No one will stop us — not The Hague, not the Axis of Evil and no one else,” he said at a televised news conference on Saturday.
 






‘Freedom seekers, not war seekers’
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, addressing a conference in Istanbul through a video link, said: “We are not seekers of wars. We are seekers of freedom.” He said the attack was, in part, a response to the years-long Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip.
 
 

On Sunday, Israeli forces also claimed to have struck rocket launching pits in the territory’s north and hit targets across the Gaza Strip including the main southern city Khan Yunis. Also, Hamas military wing the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades reported “clashes with Zionist (Israeli) forces” in Khan Yunis.
Fighting was concentrated in the southern city of Khan Younis, where Hamas said its fighters hit an Israeli tank, as well as in Al-Bureij and Al Maghazi in central Gaza, where the Israeli military claimed to have killed several Palestinians.
84,000 casualties in 100 days
Over the past 24 hours, the Gaza health ministry said 125 people had been killed and 265 wounded, bringing the total number confirmed to have been killed since the start of the war to almost 24,000, with more than 60,000 wounded.
 






Communications and internet services were down, complicating the work of emergency and ambulance crews trying to help people in areas hit by fighting.
The Gaza Strip’s people suffer acute shortages of food, water, medicine and fuel, and the health system is collapsing.
“The massive death, destruction, displacement, hunger, loss and grief of the last 100 days are staining our shared humanity,” said Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, during a visit to Gaza.
 






He warned an entire generation of children in Gaza were being “traumatised”, diseases were spreading and the clock was “ticking fast towards famine”.
Winter rains have exacerbated the dire conditions for millions of Palestinians displaced by the violence, according to UN estimates.

4,Economy would have been worse sans PTI ouster: Saad Rafique,PML-N leader claims that many areas that were his stronghold have been carved out of his constituency.,"LAHORE: PML-N leader Khwaja Saad Rafiq has conceded that economy is in bad shape but claimed it could have been worse had PTI not been ousted from power in 2022.
Speaking at an election meeting on Sunday, the PML-N leader said the government has no resources to pay salaries to its employees and squarely blamed PTI’s policies for the poor economic condition.
 






He said the “looming danger of a default” was the reason for bringing a no-confidence motion against former prime minister Imran Khan in 2022.
“If no confidence [motion] had failed, Pakistan would have defaulted like Sri Lanka. Bread would’ve cost Rs500 and the value of US dollar would’ve increased to Rs1,000.”
The PML-N leader added that there were doubts regarding the move, and the then opposition was told to let the ex-PM “die a political death”.
He claimed Mr Khan had plans to appoint the army chief and chief justice of his choice to pave the way for “staying at the helm for 20 years like Putin”.
After ousting the PTI leader from power, Mr Rafiq said, the coalition government started on the “treacherous journey” to revive the economy.
 






“The coffers were empty, and no country was ready to lend a single dollar since their leaders were miffed at him [Mr Khan].”
Pakistan was forced to go back to the IMF because no other country was willing to help without the Fund’s programme, the PML-N leader said.
The former railway minister claimed PML-N leadership knew it would have to pay a political price for accepting the “baggage of the PTI” but added that the decision was taken “for the sake of the country”.
He urged the people not to take the Feb 8 general elections lightly and come out to vote for the PML-N so that it could resume “the journey toward progress and development,” which has been left incomplete since 2018.
“We need a government and a leader who knows how to work and deal with the world to bring investment in the country.”
Mr Rafiq stressed that elections had been held in the past as well, but this time, it would be different, and PML-N supporters must not take the exercise easy by abstaining from voting.
He also complained about the delimitation, claiming that many areas which were his stronghold have been carved out of his constituency.

5,Maldives tells India to withdraw troops by March as row deepens,The deadline was set during talks with Indian officials,"MALE: The Maldivian president told India on Sunday to withdraw its nearly 100 troops by March 15, a day after returning from China where he signed a raft of deals.
New Delhi considers the Indian Ocean archipelago to be within its sphere of influence but the country has shifted to China’s orbit, the Maldives’s largest external creditor.
The March deadline was set during talks with Indian officials in the Maldives on Sunday, a top aide to President Mohamed Muizzu said, honouring the leader’s long-standing election pledge.
“The president put forth this request at the meeting of the high-level committee between the two nations... the proposal is currently under consideration,” Muizzu’s Public Policy Secretary Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim told reporters.

The deadline was set during talks with Indian officials

India has a deployment of about 89 personnel, including medical staff, to operate three aircraft to patrol the archipelago’s vast maritime territory.
Independent nation
Muizzu came to power in September after pledging to evict Indian forces.
On Saturday, after arriving in the capital Male, the president said that while the Maldives may be small, the country will not be bullied.
“We are not a country that is in the backyard of another country. We are an independent nation,” Muizzu said.
“This territorial integrity policy is one that China respects,” he said in the nation’s Dhivehi language, the Mihaaru newspaper reported.
With Beijing and New Delhi tussling for influence, Muizzu was elected in September after pledging to cultivate “strong ties” with China.
“We may be small, but that doesn’t give you the licence to bully us,” Muizzu said, in a final comment in English.
He has denied seeking to redraw the regional balance by bringing in Chinese forces to replace Indian troops.
Muizzu’s trip to China this week was his first state visit since becoming president.
China’s state broadcaster CCTV said deals included “infrastructure construction, medical care and health care, improvement of people’s livelihoods, new energy sources, agriculture and marine environmental protection” agreements.
Diminish reliance
Tensions with New Delhi flared after three of Muizzu’s junior ministers reportedly called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi a “clown” and a “terrorist” in since-deleted social media posts earlier this month.
Bollywood actors and some of India’s cricket greats responded with calls for compatriots to boycott their southern neighbour and instead book their next holidays closer to home.
Muizzu said the Maldives will also slash reliance on India for healthcare and medicine, adding more countries where citizens needing government-paid health treatment abroad can go.
Most eligible citizens currently get treatment in India, as well as small numbers in Sri Lanka and Thailand, officials said.
But Muizzu said the government would “diminish reliance on... a select group of countries”, without specifically mentioning India, and would now support treatment also in the United Arab Emirates.
Most pharmaceuticals in the Maldives are currently imported from India, and Male will now seek to import medicines from the United States and European nations, he said.
At the same time, Muizzu, the former capital’s mayor, suffered his first electoral setback as his party’s candidate lost the vote to replace him.
Adam Azim of the former ruling Maldivian Democratic Party, which is seen as more pro-Indian, won the seat.
