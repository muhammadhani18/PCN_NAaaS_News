0,"Over 1,500 polling stations declared ‘sensitive’ in Rawalpindi district","According to sources, troops are likely to be deployed at the “highly sensitive polling stations” on polling day.","RAWALPINDI: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has categorised 1,558 polling stations, out of 2,777 to be set up in Rawalpindi district for the upcoming Feb 8 general elections, as sensitive, official sources disclosed to Dawn here on Sunday.
Out of these 1,558 polling stations, 580 have been placed in A-Category of “highly sensitive” whereas 978 have been declared “sensitive” and put in Category-B. 
Troops are likely to be deployed at the “highly sensitive polling stations” on the polling day, the sources said, adding that all station house officers (SHOs) of the areas where these polling stations will be set up have been directed to assess the security situation.
The sources said that the decisions were made at a top-level meeting which had been convened to chalk out foolproof security arrangements for the polling day. The senior police officers have also been directed to hold meetings with returning officers (ROs) and assistant returning officers (AROs) and keep in contact with them regarding security arrangements.
Besides this, the police officers have also been asked to provide an estimate about the number of CCTV cameras to be installed at the sensitive polling stations and also to identify the highly sensitive areas where the troops, Rangers and Quick Response Force (QRF) personnel would be positioned. They have also been asked to point out areas where the checkposts would be established and to identify the places where the reserve force would be stationed in stand-by mode.
Every SHO, they said, had been instructed to secure surety bonds from those who wanted to organise public meetings and processions and to make sure that the location of such events was chosen with security in mind.
All the events must be noted in the Roznamcha (daily report) of police stations of the areas where these events would be planned. The police officials have been warned strict departmental action if found absent from duty.
Similarly, control rooms would be established to monitor the security situation when the polling material will be transported to the polling stations.
There are seven National Assembly and 14 provincial assembly seats in the Rawalpindi district which has 3,307,083 registered voters.
The ECP has already released guidelines for the efficient and transparent administration of the elections as well as for transportation of the polling staff, election materials and their safe transportation to and from the RO offices after the voting is finished.
The ECP had already issued orders to complete all transportation and communication plans and other arrangements five days prior to the polling day and to share it with the provisional election commissioners who will submit it to the ECP central control room established in the Secretariat.
Following the ECP’s guideline, the police and Regional Transport Authority claimed to have completed 90 per cent of the task of providing transport for the election duty.

1,"Drap, NIH asked to ensure availability of anti-rabies vaccines",ISLAMABAD: Federal Ombudsman Ejaz Ahmed Qureshi on Sunday directed the heads of the Drug Regulatory Authority of...,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Ombudsman Ejaz Ahmed Qureshi on Sunday directed the heads of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) and the National Institute of Health (NIH) to take urgent steps for ensuring fast-track availability of the anti-rabies vaccines in government hospitals of the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) and remove all bureaucratic bottlenecks in this regard.
It may be recalled that in response to a public complaint received recently in his office, he took a serious notice of the unavailability of this essential vaccine in Islamabad’s government hospitals and summoned the senior officials of both these organisations on January 9 to unearth the root cause of the situation.
He had also directed Drap to conduct a thorough probe as to why the NIH was not manufacturing this essential vaccine.
As a follow-up measure, the office of Wafaqi Mohtasib immediately issued a notice to both the organisations - NIH and Drap - and the registrar of the Wafaqi Mohtasib initiated a probe into the matter.
It was revealed that apart from lengthy official procedures, bureaucratic delays, gross negligence, mismanagement and fluctuation of the dollar rate resulted in this unfortunate situation.
The ombudsman directed that responsibility might be fixed for the shortage of this essential vaccine and necessary steps be initiated for avoiding recurrence of such incidents in future.
The matter is being vigorously followed by the Office of the Wafaqi Mohtasib and all stakeholders have assured that they would spare no effort in this regard.
It may also be informed that two hearings have already been held in the Wafaqi Mohtasib’s office which were attended by the representatives of the organisations concerned.

2,Five police officials suspended for ‘raiding’ PTI chairman’s house,"Insider terms action a formality, says raid could not have taken place without approval of high-ups.","ISLAMABAD: A day after a police team ‘mistakenly’ raided the residence of PTI chief Barrister Gohar Ali Khan in Sector F-7, the police suspended at least five officials, including the Margallah police station SHO, after finding ‘sufficient proof’ that the police officials raided the house of the lawyer.
According to a notification issued by the DPO City, five officials had been suspended from their duties till further orders. Along with SHO Haider Ali, Sub Inspector Mansabdar, constables Sajjad and Tahir, and Shabana were suspended for the raid.
“Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Akbar Nasir Khan has appointed the DPO City as an inquiry officer with a direction to take strict action against the responsible police officials. The DPO has suspended five officials who were involved in the raid,” he said.
Divisional Police Officer (DPO) City Abdul Aleem Khan has been appointed as an inquiry officer with a direction to submit a detailed report within three days. According to the police spokesperson, the police raided the house on Saturday to arrest a proclaimed offender (PO) from a house located in Sector F-7/2, but the team came back after it realised that the residence belonged to the PTI chairman.

Insider terms action a formality, says raid could not have taken place without approval of high-ups

Speaking to Dawn, a police insider contested the official narrative and said it was not possible that the police team was unaware of the residence of the PTI chairman.
“Every police station maintains a register in which addresses of all important personalities, residing in the limits of the police station, are written. I am sure that the police deliberately raided the house of Mr Gohar, who was in the Supreme Court at that time. The message behind the raid was ‘loud and clear’ that they don’t care about both Mr Gohar and the Supreme Court,” the police official claimed on the condition of anonymity.
He further said that the suspension of police officials was “just a formality”, as no senior police officer was suspended for the raid, which could not have taken place without the approval of the senior police officials. “Such raids cannot be conducted without bypassing the high-ups and getting the search warrant from the magistrate. However, it is not known whether the police bothered to get a search warrant,” he said.
On Saturday, the police raided the house of Gohar Ali Khan, followed by ‘contradictory’ statements issued by the department. Initially, it distanced itself from the raid, but after a video went viral on social media, the police accepted the responsibility for the raid but said the team did not know about the residence.
The raid occurred when the PTI chairman was in the Supreme Court for a hearing. He informed the chief justice that the police raided his house, roughed up his son, and also stole a laptop and some documents from his residence. The court summoned the police chief as a result, who also visited the residence of the PTI chairman.
Talking to the media outside the PTI chairman’s house on Saturday, the police chief said that under the directives of the top court, he visited the house of Barrister Gohar Ali Khan to meet him and hear his complaint. “A police team is also examining the crime scene because of his complaint,” he said, adding that the SP City was supervising the team investigating the incident.

4,PPP gets new lease of life in Chakwal,"CHAKWAL: In a dramatic political twist, the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPP), which was grappling to...","CHAKWAL: In a dramatic political twist, the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPP), which was grappling to find its lost space for the last four decades in Chakwal, got a new lease of life as former parliamentarian Sardar Zulfiqar Ali Khan Dullah yet again stunned political observers by bagging the ticket of PPP for NA-58 after quitting Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) which he had hardly joined six weeks ago after denouncing the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on whose ticket he was elected MNA by a big margin in 2018.
Mr Dullah who was elected as member of the Punjab Assembly in 2013 elections on Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) ticket was also awarded the ticket for the same constituency by the PML-N in 2018 elections. However at the eleventh hour he returned the ticket of PML-N and grabbed PTI’s ticket for NA-58 after its candidate, Sardar Ghulam Abbas, lost his appeal before the Supreme Court against the rejection of his nomination papers.
Mr Dullah repeated the same move now as he was supposed to contest the election under the banner of IPP which he joined on November 29 last year during a meeting with Jahangir Khan Tareen.
Known as the master of playing political cards appropriately, Mr Dullah not only secured the support of two PTI leaders Advocate Chaudhry Taimoor Ali Khan and his brother Advocate Chaudhry Naushad Ali Khan, he also successfully persuaded them to join PPP.
“The joining of Mr Dullah, Mr Naushad and Mr Taimooor has strengthened the PPP in Chakwal and we would present three seats from Chakwal as gifts to our chairman,” PPP district president Raja Rizwan Dandotsaid.
Taimoor Ali Khan and his brother Naushad Ali Khan had submitted their nomination papers for NA-58 and PP-20 hoping that the PTI would award tickets to them. However, the PTI preferred Ayaz Amir in NA-58 and Ali Nasir Bhatti in PP-20, who have now been rendered “independents” as the party was denied its symbol, bat, by the Supreme Court on Saturday’s midnight verdict.


Chaudhry Naushad Ali Khan

 
PPP district President Raja Rizwan Dandot and Qazi Arshad had submitted their nomination papers for NA-58 and PP-20 respectively.However both candidates withdrew their nomination papers in favour of Mr Dullah and Mr Naushad who got the party tickets on Saturday.
Talking to Dawn on Sunday, Mr Taimoor said although his brother Naushad Ali Khan would contest the election under the banner of PPP from PP-20, he would also vie for NA-58 as an independent candidate. However in the evening he also withdrew his candidature and announced that he was joining PPP at his residence.
Sons of Chakwal’s notable personality Chaudhry Mohammad Ali, Taimoor Ali Khan and Naushad are in the position of rejuvenating PPP by damaging PTI as they enjoy a considerable vote bank due to their influential family background.
In PP-21, PPP district president Raja Rizwan Dandot had also filed his nomination papers but according to him his candidature was withdrawn mistakenly as his lawyer had submitted withdrawal application for PP-20 along with NA-58 by mistake.


Hassan Sardar

 
“I have filed an appeal before the Election Commission requesting it to allow me to contest the election from PP-21,” Mr Dandot said.
Although Mr Dullah was allocated thesymbol of ‘arrow’, Mr Naushad was given the symbol of ‘pomegranate’ instead of ‘arrow’.


Sardar Zulfiqar Ali Khan Dullah

 
A source in the returning officer’s office said Mr Naushad was not given PPP’s arrow symbol because he mentioned his affiliation with PTI in his nomination papers and also submitted the PPP ticket late at night. However, Mr Naushad said he had filed an appeal before the ECP seeking the allocation of ‘arrow’ symbol.


Raja Mazhar Hussain

 
The PPP also changed its horses in Talagang’s two constituencies, NA-59 and PP-23, at the eleventh hour. The party had issued tickets to Qazi Mohammad Altaf and Khalida Parveen in NA-58 and PP-23, respectively, but then took the tickets back from them and allocated them to Hassan Sardar (NA-59) and Azmat Hayat (PP-23). However in PP-22, the party’s district general secretary, Raja Mazhar Hussain, is the candidate who had started his campaign a month ago.
PPP swept the polls in Chakwal in 1970 when Mohammad Amir Khan, the father of veteran columnist Ayaz Amir, and Malik Mohammad Sadiq were elected MNAs. The last time PPP won two seats - one of National Assembly and the other of Punjab Assembly - was in 1993 when Sardar Mumtaz Khan Tamman and Sardar Ghulam Abbas were elected MNA and MPA, respectively. After 1993, PPP could not win a single seat in Chakwal and Talagang.

5,Retired general from  GB appointed AJK recruitment body head,"MUZAFFARABAD: At long last, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government has taken the first step towards ...","MUZAFFARABAD: At long last, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government has taken the first step towards resurrecting the virtually dysfunctional Public Service Commission (PSC) by appointing its chairman and three out of nine members.
As per an official notification, which carried the date of January 13 (Saturday) but surfaced on Sunday, the government had appointed the chairman and three members for a three-year term under Article 48 (2) of the AJK Constitution, 1974, read with Section 3 of the Azad Jammu & Kashmir Public Service Commission (AJKPSC) Act, 1986.
Retired Lt-Gen Hidayatur Rehman was appointed as chairman, while former secretary to the AJK government Aijaz Hussain Lone, former director general of the Auqaf department Hafiz Muhammad Ibrahim Aziz, and former district and sessions judge Khawaja Saeed Bashir Butt were appointed as members.
Section 3(i)(ii) of the PSC Act reads: “Seven members of the commission shall be appointed from amongst the retired civil servants or other outstanding persons, having a good reputation and educational background of not less than graduation from any recognised university; and three members of the commission shall be appointed from the educationists or scholars, having a good reputation and experience of not less than 10 years of teaching, administration, or both.”
The three-year term of the previous chairman and members had expired in May last year and ever since the present coalition government had been sitting tight on the composition of the PSC, notwithstanding anguished calls by the unemployed educated youth and the tiny opposition.
On Saturday, opposition PTI lawmaker Rafique Nayyar publicly censured the AJK’s coalition government for closing legitimate channels of employment for educated youth by avoiding the mandatory composition of the PSC.
Interestingly, on November 17 last year, Justice Syed Shahid Bahar of the AJK High Court had also taken exception to the non-composition of the PSC since May 2023, owing to which, he had noted, “the constitutional body established for the purpose of conducting tests and examinations for recruitment to the civil services of the state was dysfunctional for all its practical purposes.”
Justice Bahar had categorically directed the relevant quarters [the president and the government] to do the needful pertaining to the composition of the PSC within a period of one month from the date of the pronouncement of his judgment.
Nevertheless, it took the government almost two months to abide by the judgment, and that too to a limited extent.
The new AJK PSC chairman belongs to the Astore Valley of Gilgit-Baltistan and had held the positions of corps commander Peshawar and inspector general training and evaluation in GHQ before his retirement from the army on October 1, 2018.
He is the third chairman of this constitutional body in succession who is an ex-serviceman.
Prior to him, Air Marshal retired Masood Akhtar, who belonged to Kotli, had served as chairman from May 2020 to May 2023, and Lt-Gen retired Mohsin Kamal, who belonged to Muzaffarabad, had served as chairman from December 2016 to December 2019.
Before that, Justice Khawaja Shahad Ahmed, a retired chief justice of the AJK Supreme Court, was at the head of the PSC.
However, on December 16, 2016, the then PML-N government terminated the services of the chairman and nine members, around 28 months after their appointment by the previous PPP government, while charging them with “committing malpractices or gross illegality and for not performing duties efficiently and in a transparent manner.”

7,‘Poor tax collection from cigarette industry incurred Rs567bn loss’,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has lost Rs567 billion potential revenue in the last seven years due to loopholes in policies of...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has lost Rs567 billion potential revenue in the last seven years due to loopholes in policies of tax collection from the cigarette industry.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) emphasises the need to safeguard tobacco tax policies from vested interests of cigarette companies for effective development, implementation and enforcement of public health initiatives. However, it did not happen in the country.
These are the findings of a study titled ‘FBR missed the targets since 2017 after introduction of third-tire’ conducted by Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).
It stated that the decision to introduce the third tier was taken by the then government under the influence of multinational cigarette companies. However, the country lost Rs567 billion potential revenue because of the decision taken in 2017.
Talking to media, country head Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids Malik Imran said the PML-N’s last government introduced third tier due to the pressure of two big cigarette companies operating in Pakistan.
He demanded the government to initiate inquiry on the basis of the report and take immediate action against those companies.
Meanwhile, researchers and analysts have demanded urgent attention and comprehensive reforms to navigate through these challenges and counter the influence of the powerful cigarette industry giants.
The SDPI study has also shed light on the dynamics of the cigarette industry and its strong influence.
The study highlighted how high and middle-income countries successfully imposed high taxes on cigarette products to decrease consumption and increase government revenues, but Pakistan lacked a clear strategy on using cigarette taxation and prices as a public health tool.
According to details, multinational cigarette companies pushed authorities to introduce a three-tier excise duty structure in 2017, while shifting the focus on revenue collection and ignoring adverse effects on public health.
However, it was later proved that the target of collecting more revenue through introduction of the third tier was also missed and was grossly misleading.

PPP veteran Sumera Gul will face PML-N’s Daniyal Chaudhry, PTI’s Shaheryar Riaz, and Sheikh Rashid Ahmed in NA-56 on Feb 8. The PPP also gave her a chance in the 2018 elections but she got only 5,583 votes while her opponent PML-N Daniyal Chaudhry got 91,000 votes and PTI-backed Sheikh Rashid Ahmed got 117,719 votes.
In the 1997 elections, PPP nominated Naheed Khan, a close aide of former prime minister and PPP chairperson Benazir Bhutto, but she failed to defeat then PML-N candidate Sheikh Rashid Ahmed. But, Naheed Khan gave a tough time to Sheikh Rashid.
On the other hand, the PTI nominated Seemabia Tahir for NA-57, a constituency won by Imran Khan in the 2013 elections. She was in the Punjab Assembly on a reserved seat in 2018 assembly. After Sadaqat Abbasi parted ways with the PTI in light of the May violence, Seemabia Tahir was elevated to PTI Punjab North President.
This is the second time that the PTI has fielded a woman candidate. In 2013, Hina Manzoor contested polls from Cantonment but was defeated by PML-N’s Malik Abrar Ahmed. Ms Manzoor got 68,473 votes from NA-55, Malik Abrar got 76,255, and PPP’s Zamrud Khan got 13,166.
A senior PTI leader told Dawn that the PTI wanted to teach a lesson to ‘turncoats’ who changed their loyalties at a time when the former ruling party was facing the brunt of the May 9 events.

9,Bahria Town told to deposit fee before getting building plans,ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has directed the Bahria Town management to deposit...,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has directed the Bahria Town management to deposit commercialisation fee amounting to around Rs2 billion before getting the building plans from the civic agency.
The CDA’s planning wing, on August 29 last year, had conditionally approved layout plans of Bahria Paradise Commercial Scheme-IV located in Zone 5 of Islamabad. However, the housing scheme did not deposit the commercialisation charges. Subsequently, the CDA, on October 17, issued a letter to the said housing scheme, directing it to deposit Rs1.84 billion.
According to the letter issued by deputy director planning Abdul Haq Brohi, “Layout plans of Bahria Paradise Commercial Scheme-1, 2, 3 and 4 was approved by the authority…. on an area of measuring 250 kanal, 173.66 kanal, 226.91 kanal and 243.34 kanals having commercial area on 137.28 kanal, 73.19 kanal, 90.88 kanal, 104.66 kanal respectively.”
It said: “ As per clause 2 (b) of the approval letters, you were advised to submit the commercialisation charges @ Rs7,500 per sq yard of the saleable area (as per actual size of plot), through bank draft/pay order in favour of DDO- Planning, CDA, but the same has not been received till date.” 
“You are once again advised to deposit the commerlisation charges,” the letter said. Last week, the issue was taken afresh when the CDA was approached for the approval of building plans.
“We have informed the management of the housing scheme in question that we can’t proceed further without getting commerlisation charges. So, they have been directed to deposit the fee,” a CDA director said.
He said the approval of building plan was conditional and it was linked with the submission of fee and fulfillment of several conditions, which is our common practice, he said. 
“The management of Bahria is in touch with the CDA, hopefully they will soon deposit the fees to move forward,” he added.

10,Surgical procedures at Pims ‘affected’ due to shortage of funds,"Hospital says supplies are being rationalised, assures operation theatres will remain functional","ISLAMABAD: As it faces a financial crunch due to a shortage of funds, the surgical procedures at Islamabad’s largest hospital – the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences – have been affected due to a scarcity of surgical blades, protective equipment, and several other items.
Last week, a list of nine items – surgical blades, disposable sheets, disposable gown, sterilised gloves, gauze, abdominal sponges, crepe bandage, face mask, and plaster – was affixed outside the main operation theatre in the hospital, which created panic among patients as well as staffers, who feared the surgeries at the hospital might be suspended. But the hospital spokesperson assured that the procedures would not be affected despite the shortage of products.
Dr Mubashir Mushtaq Daha said that the hospital had rationalised the supplies due to a financial crunch but it would be ensured that the surgeries were not affected. The speculations were also fueled because of messages shared by a number of Pims doctors with the media, claiming that due to the shortage of funds, the surgical procedures were being suspended. A senior doctor, requesting anonymity, said that it was correct that the OTs were not getting supplies as per their requirements, hampering the routine procedures.
“We are getting almost 50pc supplies due to which it has become difficult for us to continue surgeries in the hospital. We have been demanding a number of items from the attendants of patients for the surgeries but now the extra financial burden has been put on them,” he said.

Hospital says supplies are being rationalised, assures operation theatres will remain functional

It is also noted that the hospital staff has also started asking the attendants with the patients to purchase all the missing items required for surgeries, otherwise the procedures would not be conducted.
Pims Executive Director Dr Rana Imran Sikander, in a statement, said that it was not correct that the surgeries were being suspended. He claimed that the supplies were provided as per the demand of the surgeons and it was “impossible that the surgeries would be suspended because of the unavailability of supplies”.
Pims spokesperson Dr Daha said that it was being investigated that who pasted the list outside the operation theatre and what was the objective of pasting such a document. He, however, did confirm that the hospital was facing severe financial issues and a request for more funds from the health ministry had already been sent by the hospital management.
“We have been rationalising the cost of supplies. Currently, the patients in out-patient departments (OPDs) can say that they are not getting medicines, but patients in emergency departments are getting their medicines,” he said.
It is worth mentioning that in November 2023, the health ministry wrote a letter to the Finance Division demanding Rs 11 billion for the smooth functioning of hospitals within the federal capital and Shaikh Zayed Hospital Lahore. The request was turned down.
It may be noted here that a few months ago, the caretaker government decided to appoint serving officers of the Pakistan Army Medical Corps as the heads of the two largest state-run hospitals in Islamabad – Pims and Polyclinic on deputation for three years. The move was eventually hampered after a court decision, which barred the appointment of an ‘outsider’ as the Pims head.

The Capital Development Authority (CDA) had closed all three toll plazas at the entry points of the Capital City—Golra Mor on the Srinagar Highway, Rawat on the Expressway and Karnal Sher Khan Road (formerly known as IJP Road)—in 2013–14 under the direction of then interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.
However, the CDA board, in a recent meeting, decided to restore the said three toll plazas to collect revenue, which will be spent on overhauling the roads.
“Yes, in a recent board meeting, we decided to restore toll plazas,” said Dr Mohammad Khalid Hafiz, member engineering CDA.
When asked about the toll rates, the member engineering said: “Our finance wing is working on the rates to be charged to motorists. The rates will be reasonable,” Mr Hafiz said.
Another official of the CDA said that toll collection is a common international and national practice, which is imperative for the overhaul of the roads. He said that all funds to be collected from these toll plazas would be spent on overhauling the said roads.
During the PML-N government, on the directives of the then interior minister, the CDA in 2013 stopped collecting tolls at the city’s entry points after completing their contracts. The contract for collecting tolls on Srinagar Highway, Golra Mor, and Karnal Sher Khan Road ended in 2013, and the contract for Islamabad Highway at Rawat ended on January 17, 2014.
Earlier, in 2019, the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI), during its sessions, had approved the restoration of the said three toll plazas, but their plan could not be materialised.The MCI officials were expecting Rs 2 billion in annual revenue from these toll plazas.
Before the formation of MCI, CDA used to regulate these toll plazas, but when MCI was formed, it decided to collect revenue from these toll plazas, but failed to award contracts. Now, once again, the CDA has decided to take steps to restore them.
“Recently, we got approval from the CDA board, as collection from toll plazas is necessary for timely repair and maintenance of these roads,” said an official of the CDA, adding that spending the funds of the CDA on these inter-provincial roads makes no sense.
“The funds, which CDA collects against various fees like property taxes, should be spent for repair and maintenance of streets and roads of urban areas, and all civic facilities should be provided to these tax payers. This is not fair; we spend CDA’s funds on overhauling and repair works such as Expressway and IJP Road, etc,” the official said, adding that by spending around six billion recently, the CDA completed expansion and rehabilitation work on the IJP road, while a project worth over Rs 10 billion for the expansion of Expressway is in progress.
“A board member of CDA said that all the realities related to CDA’s funding and various road projects were placed before the CDA board while getting approval of restoration of the toll plazas, and board endorsed CDA’s plea for restoration,” he said.

13,Ilyas for ‘out of the box’ measures  to highlight Kashmir issue,MUZAFFARABAD: Former prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and regional president of Istehkam-i-Pakistan...,"MUZAFFARABAD: Former prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and regional president of Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) Sardar Tanveer Ilyas has underlined the need of looking for some “out of the box” ways to efficaciously highlight the Kashmir issue and mould international opinion in favour of its early settlement.
“It’s high time to accelerate efforts to present our legitimate case not only to the opinion makers in media and human rights organisations but also ordinary people from other nations. This, however, cannot be done through the traditional stereotypical methods but through some out of the box measures,” he said in a conversation with a group of journalists on Sunday.
“This is bound to send a convincing message across the world and yield desired results,” he believed.
In the same context, the former AJK prime minister, who is also an Islamabad-based business tycoon, went on to suggest that the office of deputy prime minister should be created in Pakistan through a constitutional amendment and given to a ‘State Subject’ (citizen of the state of Jammu and Kashmir).
“When a Kashmiri deputy prime minister will talk about the urgency of the settlement of Kashmir issue during foreign trips, his statements and observations will be given weightage by the international community,” he said.
In the same breath, he said: “If the president, prime minister and deputy prime minister of Pakistan lead a five-minute walk in Brussels – the de facto capital of the European Union - on Kashmir, it will create a meaningful impact by focusing attention on the imperativeness of the festering issue’s early settlement.”
Referring to the performance of Pakistani missions, the former AJK premier said the government of Pakistan should fulfill the long overdue demand of the establishment of Kashmir desks in its embassies which should be exclusively tasked with organising different Kashmir issue related events in each calendar year.
He was of the view that on the occasion of national days, like February 5, Pakistan should convince other countries to stand in solidarity with the Kashmiris engaged in their just struggle for right to self-determination.
“If only 10 countries openly stand with Pakistan, it will increase pressure on India,” he said.
The former AJK prime minister also emphasised that the brotherly Islamic countries should stand with Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir.
“India has built a temple in Abu Dhabi; why is there so much indifference on the issue of Kashmir, are they [Kashmiris] not believers?”
Asserting that the government in Muzaffarabad was the representative government of the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir, the former premier regretted that it had failed to properly look after the families of post-1989 migrants from across the divide.
“Due to the unprecedented repression in areas along the Line of Control after the launch of anti-India armed struggle, these families were forced to flee their homes and hearths and take refuge in the liberated territory. But what kind of base camp was it that could not take care of them and as a result some 800 families returned to the occupied territory in straitened circumstances.”
