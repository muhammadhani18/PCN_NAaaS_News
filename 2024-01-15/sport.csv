0,VAR calls help UAE spoil Hong Kong’s Asian Cup return,DOHA: Hong Kong’s first Asian Cup match in over 55 years ended in a 3-1 defeat to the United Arab Emirates on...,"DOHA: Hong Kong’s first Asian Cup match in over 55 years ended in a 3-1 defeat to the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, the returning minnows on the wrong end of three big VAR calls in Qatar.
Two of the UAE’s goals came from VAR-ruled penalties, while a late Hong Kong goal was chalked off after the referee checked the screen.
Coach Jorn Andersen warned his players before the game that the  “gap is very big” between themselves and the continent’s footballing elite.
But there was no yawning gulf in class as the tournament’s lowest-ranked side kicked off their campaign.
In their first Asian Cup match since 1968, Hong Kong fell behind just after the half-hour mark.
Referee Muhammad Taqi was called to the pitch-side screen to rule on a possible handball in the box by Hong Kong defender Oliver Gerbig.
After a lengthy check, a penalty was given and duly converted by Sultan Adil.
Hong Kong levelled four minutes after the break, Philip Chan bundling home an Everton Camargo cross.
The UAE regained the lead almost instantly through Zayed Sultan as he slotted into an unguarded net.
With half an hour left, Andersen rolled the dice with an attacking double substitution, sending on forwards Stefan Pereira and Michael Udebuluzor.
Hong Kong defender Li Ngai-hoi then survived another VAR scare, his tackle in the box ruled legal.
As the clock ticked down Hong Kong pushed for a second equaliser, their chances helped by the addition of 10 minutes’ stoppage time.
But after a third VAR check against them, the referee pointed once again to the spot and Yahya Al-Ghassani converted.
Hong Kong had the ball in the net one last time, but VAR intervened to deny them.
Earlier, Japan came from behind to beat Vietnam 4-2 in their Group ‘D’ opener in a thrilling encounter at the Al Thumama  Stadium where five goals were scored in the first half and Takumi  Minamino grabbed a brace. 
Japan, four-times champions who last won the Asian Cup in 2011, were shocked into action when Vietnam took a 2-1 lead before the Samurai Blue cut their south-east Asian opponents down to size with two goals just before halftime. 
“I know people in Japan wanted to see a game where we overcome our  opponents with great power, but opening games in tournaments are always  difficult and that’s what we saw today,” Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu  told reporters. 
“When we lost the lead in the first half the players were very  calm, they knew they had the whole 90 minutes to play for the win. They  managed to do that in the end of the first half.”
Vietnam’s initial  resistance when the game kicked off lasted all of 10 minutes before  Japan scored, with Minamino being in the right place at the right time  to pounce on a rebound and guide it through a crowd of players into the  net. 
But Vietnam shocked Japan with an equaliser five minutes later from  a corner when Nguyen Dinh Bac — running away from goal — directed a  glancing header that looped over the keeper and into the net at the far  post. 
As the game opened up and with both sides creating chances, it was  Vietnam who took the lead from another set piece when Bui Hoang Anh  headed the cross to the far post where Japan keeper Zion Suzuki failed  to deal with it and Pham Tuan Hai fired home. 
In Saturday’s late match, Uzbekistan and Syria played out a 0-0 draw to earn a point each in their Group ‘B’ clash.

Inter, who are on a 14-game unbeaten streak in the league, lead the table with 51 points from 20 games ahead of second-placed Juventus who host lowly Sassuolo on Tuesday.
“Monza are a good team with good players but if we play like we did  today it’ll be hard for anyone to beat us,” said Calhanoglu to Sky  Sport.Inter got a quick start against Monza as Calhanoglu gave them the lead with a 12th-minute penalty, sending a low shot inside the post after the spot kick was given for handball.
Martinez, whose attempt had led to the penalty, looked disappointed at not taking it himself but the Argentine did double the lead two minutes later from close range.
Monza struggled to get out of their own half in the opening stages but came close to scoring in the 30th minute when midfielder Matteo Pessina nodded the ball home following a free kick but the goal was ruled out for an offside.
Inter continued to dominate after the break and Calhanoglu added a third on the hour mark from near the penalty spot, netting after a neat back-heel from Marcus Thuram.Pessina eventually pulled a goal back for the home side in the 69th with a spot kick but Martinez then made it 4-1 with another penalty after 84 minutes.
Thuram sealed the win for the visitors two minutes from time after a brilliant cross from Henrikh Mkhitaryan.Monza, who are 11th on 25 points from 20 games, visit relegation-threatened Empoli on Jan 21.
“You can only compliment a great team, because they were brilliant tonight,” said Monza coach Raffaele Palladino. “We lost a match against a really good side, but we need to clear our heads and just move on to the next game.”

2,Aston Villa stay third after goalless draw at Everton,LIVERPOOL: Aston Villa missed the chance to go second in the Premier League when they were held to a 0-0 draw by...,"LIVERPOOL: Aston Villa missed the chance to go second in the Premier League when they were held to a 0-0 draw by Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday, dominating possession in an entertaining contest but unable to break down a stubborn home side.
Villa move to 43 points from 21 games, level with second-placed Manchester City, but two behind league leaders Liverpool. Both those clubs have played a game fewer. Everton are now a point clear of the relegation zone with 17 from their 21 games.
The visitors had several chances to open the scoring, but the best opportunity in the game fell to Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin when he raced clear one-on-one with Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, but had his effort saved.
Both sides had goals correctly chalked off by the Video Assistant Referee for offside and Everton will be the happier with the point, while Villa manager Unai Emery may well view it as a missed opportunity and two dropped.
Villa thought they had the lead when Alex Morenos superb strike from outside the box arrowed into the bottom corner, but it was chalked off by the VAR for an offside in the build-up.
It took more than three minutes to make the decision, during which time both sets of supporters chanted in unison their displeasure at the use of the VAR system.
Leon Bailey forced a superb low save from Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford with a shot from eight yards that was going into the bottom corner, before the home side should have been in front.
Calvert-Lewin raced clear, but Argentine World Cup winner Martinez made a superb stop and moments later saved again from James Garner, diving low to his left.Matty Cash saw his goal-bound effort blocked and McGinns follow-up was cleared off the line.
In Saturday’s late match, Pep Guardiola said City showed the heart of champions to  fight back to beat Newcastle United 3-2 thanks to a Kevin De Bruyne  masterclass on his return to action.
The Belgian  came off the bench to score and set up Oscar Bobb’s stoppage-time winner  to announce his comeback from a five-month injury layoff in style.
Bobb’s first Premier League goal completed a thrilling comeback for City, who had taken the lead through Bernardo Silva but then shipped two goals to a fired-up Newcastle side.
Alexander Isak curled in an equaliser in the 35th minute and Anthony  Gordon sent the home fans wild with another high-quality finish past City keeper Stefan Ortega, who had replaced the injured Ederson in the fifth minute. 
City missed a series of chances in  the second half as Newcastle edged towards a morale-boosting victory,  but the mercurial De Bruyne’s arrival made all the difference.  
Victory  takes City up to second in the table, two points behind Liverpool, and  ominously poised to strike when they return from a two-week winter  break, by which point Erling Haaland may be fit to join De Bruyne in  terrorising opposition defences.
“That was really good, sometimes it is better winning that way,” said Guardiola. 
“We  played with a huge personality. They showed me they want to be there,  to fight until the end that they want to retain the title.”

3,Loeb keeps tabs with Dakar leader Sainz,AL DUWADIMI: Seba­stien Loeb sealed his third stage win of this year’s Dakar Rally to keep his quest for a...,"AL DUWADIMI: Seba­stien Loeb sealed his third stage win of this year’s Dakar Rally to keep his quest for a first-ever title on track after a series of near misses.
The record nine-time world rally champion was runner-up in the past two Dakars.
His win in stage seven reduced his deficit on overall leader Carlos Sainz by 10-and-a-half minutes although he still trails by exactly 19 minutes as the race in Saudi Arabia enters its final week.
Loeb registered his 26th overall stage success on the drive from Riyadh to Al-Duwadimi.
Loeb, in his eighth Dakar, inherited second overall after Mattias Ekstrom was knocked out of title contention by mechanical issues in his Audi hybrid.
Sainz, a three-time Dakar winner, finished fourth on the day in his Audi.
“Ekstrom being eliminated was great, but there’s another one left. Gaining time on Carlos Sainz is good news” said Loeb.
In the bike category, American Ricky Brabec leads Ross Branch by a slender second overall after Chile’s Ignacio Cornejo took his third stage this year.
‘Nacho’, Brabec’s team-mate at Honda, crossed the line more than half a minute up on defending champion Kevin Benavides (KTM).
The Chilean jumped to third in the general rankings, but is still 6min 48sec behind. Brabec was fifth on the stage.
“The day after a rest day is never easy,” the American said.
“We started off this morning third, so it was a bit tricky. All the guys I wanted to beat were behind me, so it’s been a tough day. I haven’t had a rear brake since like kilometre 40 or 50, so it’s been a slow day for me.”
Branch described his day on his two-wheel office as  “one I’d rather forget”.
The rider from Botswana added:  “We had a few technical issues early on in the stage, so it was really frustrating and I made a lot of mistakes.
“There were so many dangers and I was really riding on the limit. I just have to get the bike back, get it fixed up and ready for tomorrow.”
Monday’s eighth stage is a 458km special towards the north of the kingdom.

4,Osimhen on target but Nigeria held by Equatorial Guinea,ABID: Victor Osimhen scored a first half equaliser but wasteful Nigeria were held to a 1-1 draw in their Africa Cup...,"ABID: Victor Osimhen scored a first half equaliser but wasteful Nigeria were held to a 1-1 draw in their Africa Cup of Nations Group ‘A’ opener with Equatorial Guinea in a steamy Abidjan on Sunday, unable to turn their pressure into three points.
Iban Salvador netted a surprise opener for Equatorial Guinea against the run of play with a well-worked goal, but the lead lasted only two minutes before Napoli forward Osimhen headed Nigeria level.
The west African side dominated the chances after that but found Equatorial Guinea goalkeeper Jesus Owono in fine form as he made several outstanding saves, to go with some poor finishing.
Nigeria next meet hosts Ivory Coast in a potentially crucial pool clash on Thursday, while Equatorial Guinea face Guinea-Bissau.
The match was a slow burner, but burst into life with two goals in as many minutes towards the end of the first half.
Nigeria’s Zaidu missed an open goal at the back post when a cross from the right eluded everyone and fell kindly to him, but he skewed his shot high and wide with the goal gaping.
Equatorial Guinea took the lead on 36 minutes with a fine finish from Salvador.
Some hesitant defending saw Nigeria fail to clear the ball and when Salvador was teed up by Jose Machin 18 yards from goal, he side-footed a shot into the bottom corner with a clinical finish.
But the lead lasted only two minutes as Nigeria hit back almost immediately.
Winger Ademola Lookman hung up a cross from the left to the back post and Osimhen had the simplest of headed finishes to score his 21st international goal.
Moses Simon then forced a good low save from Equatorial Guinea goalkeeper Jesus Owono when his shot looked destined for the bottom corner as the teams went to the break at 1-1.
Zaidu had another superb chance for Nigeria early in the second half, but fired straight at the goalkeeper, before Osimhen was denied by the head of the Alaves gloveman.
It will be viewed as two points dropped for the Super Eagles, who have faced recent stinging criticism after 1-1 draws with tiny Lesotho and Zimbabwe in the World Cup qualifiers in November.
In Saturday’s tournament opening game, Ivory Coast’s Seko Fofana and Jean-Philippe Krasso scored in each half  as the hosts completed a 2-0 Group ‘A’ victory over Guinea Bissau.

Bilbao have 41 points, level with Barcelona in fourth and seven points behind leaders Real Madrid and Girona, who all have a game in hand.
Berenguer broke the deadlock on the half-hour mark by tapping in a cross from close range and 12 minutes later he doubled the advantage by capitalising on a rebound.
Sociedad attempted a late comeback and Mikel Oyarzabal reduced the deficit two minutes before stoppage time, but Bilbao held out.
Sociedad are sixth with 32 points.
Meanwhile, former Real Madrid playmaker Isco drove home with 14 minutes to go to  earn Real Betis a 1-0 win over lowly Granada to take his team seventh,  back above Las Palmas who thumped Villarreal 3-0 earlier on.
Kirian  Rodriguez struck twice as Las Palmas continued their impressive  campaign with a convincing win over struggling Villarreal.
Francisco  Garcia Pimienta’s Villarreal rose to eighth provisionally, giving them belief they can compete  for European football.
Villarreal, dumped out of the Copa del Rey  on Monday by third-tier Salamanca, languish in 14th, four points above  the relegation zone.
Kirian struck early on and Juanma Herzog doubled the islanders’ lead early in the second half when he headed in a corner.
Las  Palmas wrapped up the win when Kirian netted his second after the hour,  helping his team recover from their own Spanish cup knock-out against  local rivals Tenerife and snapping a four-game winless run.Elsewhere, Real Mallorca came back to earn a 1-1 draw against Celta Vigo.

Second-placed Nice could have cut the gap to PSG to two points with a win, but instead the reigning champions can stretch further ahead when they visit last season’s runners-up RC Lens.
Nice fell behind in the 31st minute when a header from Rennais’ Martin  Terrier struck Pablo Rosario’s arm, setting up a penalty that Benjamin  Bourigeaud converted.
Nine minutes into the second half, Arnaud  Kalimuendo doubled Rennais’ lead after receiving a through ball from Enzo  Le Fee and steering it home from an acute angle.
Earlier, Reims grabbed a 3-1 win at third-placed AS Monaco to climb into fifth.
Adi Huetter’s Monaco would have leapfrogged Nice and jumped to within four points of PSG with victory.
Maltese international Teddy Teuma gave the visitors a 35th-minute lead, although Wissam Ben Yedder levelled for Monaco shortly after half-time with his 10th goal of the season.
But German Reda Khadra restored Reims’ advantage before the hour mark and Azor Matusiwa secured a second straight league win for Will Still’s men either side of the winter break in added time.

8,"Leaders Leverkusen grab late winner, Sancho stars on Dortmund return",BERLIN: Exequiel Palacios scored in the fourth minute of injury time to earn Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen a...,"BERLIN: Exequiel Palacios scored in the fourth minute of injury time to earn Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen a 1-0 win at Augsburg on Saturday, keeping them four points clear of reigning champions Bayern Munich, while Jadon Sancho created a goal on his Borussia Dortmund return.
Bayern’s 3-0 home victory over Hoffenheim on Friday tur­n­ed up the heat on Leverkusen.
The visitors looked set to drop points for just the fourth time this season, but Argentinian World Cup winner Palacios controlled Alex Grimaldo’s cross and fired past home goalkeeper Finn Dahmen with only a minute of added time remaining.
The goal may prove crucial in the title race as Leverkusen restored their lead atop the table, with second-placed Bayern having a game in hand.
An  “emotional” Alonso admitted:  “I jumped a little (when the goal went in)... Our boys had belief to keep going until the end.
“The goal wasn’t lucky, it was a reward for our good work in the game. But it’s only one win, we need to keep going.”
On the first weekend of fixtures since Franz Beckenbauer died aged 78, each match began after a moment’s silence and a tribute to the German football legend.
Leverkusen looked slick early, carving out several chances as they dominated possession, but lacked the final killer blow without injured striker Victor Boniface.
Augsburg looked to have taken the lead through Phillip Tietz with 20 minutes remaining, but the striker’s goal was ruled out for offside and Palacios had the final say.
Meanwhile, Sancho laid on the match-sealing assist on his return after a disappointing two-and-a-half years at Manc­hester United as Borussia Dortmund won 3-0 at Darms­tadt, their first league win since November.
Sancho arrived on loan from Old Trafford on Thursday and was subbed on alongside Marco Reus early in the second half.
Dortmund were clinging on to a 1-0 lead after Julian Brandt’s early strike, with goalkeeper Gregor Kobel producing a spectacular save midway through the second period.
As he did so often during his first stint in Germany, Sancho danced down the flank and drew the Darmstadt defence before crossing for Reus to tap into an empty net with 13 minutes left.Teenage striker Youssoufa Moukoko added a third in injury time to round out the win.
The victory saw Dortmund climb within three points of the Champions League places, after fourth-placed RB Leipzig lost 1-0 earlier on Saturday at home to Eintracht Frankfurt.
Frankfurt took the lead just seven minutes in, Ansgar Knauff slamming a brilliant curling pass from Niels Nkounkou into the net.
Leipzig pushed for an equaliser but Frankfurt held on, consigning the German Cup holders to their first home league loss of the season.
Elsewhere, Union Berlin held Freiburg to a goalless draw, continuing their solid if unspectacular form under new coach Nenad Bjelica.
Union had lost nine league games in a row prior to the Croat’s arrival, but have now lost just one in four to move three points clear of the relegation play-off place.
Cologne missed a chance to move out of the automatic relegation zone, conceding a second-half goal to draw 1-1 with promoted Heidenheim.
Strugglers Mainz fought from a goal down to draw 1-1 at home with VfL Wolfsburg, picking up a valuable point to keep them in 16th, the play-off spot.

9,NZ beat Pakistan to take control of T20 series,HAMILTON: Pace bowler Adam Milne claimed four wickets as New Zealand beat Pakistan by 21 runs in the second Twenty20...,"HAMILTON: Pace bowler Adam Milne claimed four wickets as New Zealand beat Pakistan by 21 runs in the second Twenty20 International on Sunday to take a 2-0 series lead.
The tourists threw away a strong position in their run chase after Babar Azam and Fakhar Zaman scored half-centuries as they were dismissed for 173 in the final over, in response to New Zealand’s 194-8.
Victory came at a cost for the Black Caps, whose captain Kane Williamson retired hurt with a hamstring injury while batting, placing him in doubt for the remainder of the five-match series.
The match bore similarities to New Zealand’s 46-run win in the opening match in Auckland on Friday, with another aggressive batting approach led from the top by Finn Allen.
His 70 off 41 balls continued a run of form which the hard-hitting opener attributed to a change of approach. 
“I’ve been working hard on assessing conditions and choosing when to pull the trigger,” Allen said. “I’m always looking to score boundaries and be positive but it’s situational. It’s when to take a higher-risk option or a lower risk.” 
The target looked within sight for Pakistan before Fakhar was bowled by Milne for a power-packed 50 off 25 balls in the 10th over, leaving Pakistan 97-3.
They struggled from that point, with only Babar looking a threat until he was caught off Ben Sears for 66.
Milne finished with 4-33, having earlier removed the dangerous Mohammad Rizwan as Pakistan lost both openers with just 10 runs on the board.
New Zealand were again asked to bat first and Allen immediately took on the visitors’ attack, blasting five sixes and seven fours. Pakistan captain Shaheen Shah Afridi said he and the rest of his attack didn’t bowl well enough to capitalise on winning the toss. 
“With fast bowling, you go for swing and you know you need a wicket early on,” he said. “Unfortunately we missed that. If we take those one or two wickets, their score would be 170-180. But the start wasn’t very good, not the way we want.” 
The Black Caps were well placed at 111 for one at the midway point but suffered a major setback soon afterwards when Williamson was forced to retire hurt for 26.
There will be concern it is a continuation of the spate of injuries the veteran skipper has suffered in the last year. A long-standing knee problem ruled the 33-year-old out of both white-ball series at home to Bangladesh in December.
New Zealand’s middle and lower order struggled, with pace bowler Haris Rauf particularly adept over the closing overs, finishing with 3-38.

10,Mathews shines as  Sri Lanka  pull off last ball win against Zimbabwe,Sri Lanka keeps their unbeaten record against Zimbabwe in T20Is intact.,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka pulled off a thrilling three-wicket win over Zimbabwe in a last ball thriller in the first Twenty20 Intern­ational in Colombo on Sunday.
Requiring six runs off the last two balls, tail-ender Dush­ma­ntha Cham­eera smashed a bou­ndary off the penultimate ball.
Then he pushed the last ball to square leg, scampering for two runs to keep Sri Lanka’s unbeaten record against Zimbabwe in T20Is intact.
Sri Lanka owed the win to 36-year-old former captain Angelo Mathews who, playing his first T20I in almost three years, top scored with 46.
Mathews had last featured in a T20I  in March 2021, and was recalled to the side as Sri Lanka look to bolster the team with experienced players in the lead up to this year’s T20 World Cup.
Sri Lanka were 51 for four when Mathews walked out to bat, and added 32 runs off 39 balls for the fifth wicket with Charith Asalanka.
It was a crucial rebuilding period for Sri Lanka, but they were back to square one when Sikandar Raza struck twice in his last over to reduce Sri Lanka to 83 for six.
Together with fellow all-rounder Dasun Shanaka, Math­ews then was involved in a 55-run stand to take Sri Lanka close to victory.
Shanaka, who was axed as captain following last year’s 50-over World Cup, finished unbeaten on 26.
Sri Lanka required 14 runs off the last over.
Mathews hit two boundaries from the first two balls bowled by Blessing Muzarabani to bring the equation down to six from four balls.
He attempted another big hit in the fourth delivery, but failed to clear the mid-wicket boundary and was dismissed for 46, from 38 balls with five fours and one six.
Chameera knocked off the remaining runs while Sika­ndar Raza’s brilliant all-round performance was in vain.
The Zimbabwe captain had top scored with 62 in his team’s total of 143 and then picked up three wickets, but that proved to be in vain.
It was Raza’s 13th T20 half-century. His 62 came off 42 balls with five fours and two sixes.
The next match is on Tuesday in Colombo.

11,Smith relishing chance to open,"“I actually don’t like watching cricket that much [...] I’d prefer to be out there batting. It gets a bit boring sitting there [with the pads on] but I don’t have to do that anymore,” says Smith.","ADELAIDE: Steve Smith said Sunday he felt obligated to step up and replace David Warner as Australia’s Test opener, but also admitted it suited him because he got bored waiting to come in at four.
The 34-year-old veteran was a surprise pick to do the job ahead of openers Cameron Bancroft, Marcus Harris and Matt Renshaw after Warner bowed out of Test cricket this month.
He will pad up in his new role for the first time in the opening Test of a two-match series against the West Indies in Adelaide, which starts on Wednesday. 
“They (selectors) were obviously very keen to get Cameron (Green) in the side as well and play our best six batters, and for me it didn’t sit right to have him come in and bat up top,” he told reporters. “I’ve played for a long time and I’m an experienced player, and I think it’s something I should have done.” 
The highly rated Green has been sidelined recently by a resurgent Mitchell Marsh, who has assumed the all-rounder role. Shifting Smith up the order, rather than opting for a specialist opener, allowed selectors to bring Green back primarily as a batsman.
Smith revealed he had been mulling the idea as far back as the Ashes in England last year, but the prospect only crystallised during the third Test against Pakistan in Sydney this month. 
“I’m looking forward to the opportunity of getting in and facing the new ball,” he said. “It’s something that isn’t really foreign to me. I’ve batted on numerous occasions where I’ve come in early doors and I batted at number three for quite a while.” 
Former skipper Smith, who has played 105 Tests and accumulated 9,514 runs, also admitted that coming in early suited him because “I don’t like waiting to bat”. 
“I actually don’t like watching cricket that much, believe it or not,” he said. “I’d prefer to be out there batting. It gets a bit boring sitting there (with the pads on) but I don’t have to do that anymore.”

MELBOURNE: Defending champions Novak Djokovic and Aryna Sabalenka entertained bumper crowds with contrasting first-round victories over teenagers as the Australian Open got underway a day earlier than usual on Sunday.
Djokovic, who admitted he had been feeling under the weather for the last few days, needed more than four hours on Rod Laver Arena to subdue qualifier Dino Prizmic 6-2, 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-4 and remain on course for an 11th title at Melbourne Park.
That kept Sabalenka waiting almost until midnight to open her title defence against Ella Seidel but the second seed did everyone a favour by making light work of the German qualifier with a quickfire 6-0, 6-1 victory.
Djokovic’s contest was the longest first-round match he had ever played at a major and he lavished praise on Grand Slam debutant Prizmic for taking the game to him.
“I mean, I had an amazing opponent tonight,” he said of the Croatian. “For an 18-year-old, he played so maturely and confiden­tly on the court, fighting through, not giving up even when he was four down in the fourth set. I was impressed with his mentality, with his approach, with his game.”
Sabalenka was clearly delighted to be back at the site of her first Grand Slam triumph.
“I’m super happy to be back. The last time I was here I had incr­edible memories, unforgettable me­m­ories,” the 26-year-old told the fans who stuck around to watch her ruthless 53-minute walloping of Seidel. “Hopefully, I can stay until the very, very, very last day.”
In the first match of the day on the main showcourt, fourth seed Jannik Sinner, the hottest player on the men’s tour at the back end of last season, eased past Botic van de Zandschulp 6-4, 7-5, 6-3 in his first match of the new year.
Cheered on by the  “Carota Boys” — a band of fans dressed as carrots — the Italian was far from perfect but content to get through the contest in three sets.
“I think, to be honest, it was a positive opening match,” the 22-year-old said.  “Today I felt a little bit of the match feeling, it was important for me.”
Fifth seed Andrey Rublev had a much tougher time getting into round two, pushed all the way by debutant Thiago Seyboth Wild in his 7-5, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 7-6(6) win.
Rublev was clearly furious at his inability to see off the world number 78, who produced some sensational shots to frustrate the Russian and earn the support of the Margaret Court Arena crowd.
“I’m not going to forget this match,” said the relieved Rublev, who said he had flashbacks of the Brazilian’s upset of his compatriot Daniil Medvedev in the first round of last year’s French Open.
“Thiago is a super dangerous player, he was serving really hard, first and second serves, and hitting the ball really clean.”
Taylor Fritz also needed five sets to beat South American opposition, the 12th seed prevailing 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 over Argentine Facundo Diaz Acosta in another four-hour marathon.
The addition of an extra day to the tournament to help clear the first round matches left the early schedule a little light on star power.
Czech Barbora Krejcikova was the only former women’s Grand Slam winner playing in the day session and the ninth seed had to come from behind to beat Japanese wildcard Mai Hontama 2-6, 6-4, 6-3.
Women’s eighth seed Maria Sakkari had an easier time getting past her Japanese opponent Nao Hibino 6-4, 6-1 but 13th seed Liudmila Samsonova crashed out 6-3, 6-4 at the hands of American Amanda Anisimova.
Sabalenka will next play Czech qualifier Brenda Fruhvirtova, who became the youngest winner in the main draw since Coco Gauff beat Naomi Osaka in 2020 with a 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Ana Bogdan at the age of 16 years and 287 days.
Former champion Caroline Wozniacki advanced to the second round after four years away from Melbourne Park when last year’s semi-finalist Magda Linette retired due to injury while trailing 6-2, 2-0.
Marin Cilic played his first Australian Open before Fruhvirtova was born and reached the final in 2018 but he had little to celebrate after his 50th match at Melbourne Park, a 6-1, 2-6, 6-2, 7-5 loss to Hungarian Fabian Marozsan.

13,India crush Afghanistan to clinch T20 series,Arshdeep dismisses three as Jaiswal's 68 guided the Blue Team to victory.,"INDORE: Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shivam Dube smashed half-centuries as India thrashed Afghanistan by six wickets to clinch the series in the second Twenty20 international in Indore on Sunday.
Jaiswal, who hit 68 off 34 balls, returned to the team along with star batsman Virat Kohli after the two missed the opening win of the three-match series.
Jaiswal put on key partnerships including 92-run stand with left-handed partner Dube, who hit an unbeaten 63, as India chased down their victory target with 26 balls to spare and take an unbeatable 2-0 lead.
Bowlers set up victory with left-arm spinner Axar Patel leading the charge with figures of 2-17 to bowl out Afghanistan for 172 despite Gulbadin Naib’s 57.
Kohli, who played his first T20 for India since November 2022, made 29 in a partnership of 57 after skipper Rohit Sharma fell for a second successive duck.
Jaiswal took apart the opposition bowling after left-arm quick Fazalhaq Farooqi bowled Rohit and fellow fast bowler Naveen-ul-Haq took down Kohli.
Jaiswal reached his fourth T20 half-ton for India and Dube, who starred in the team’s opening win, joined the charge to hit his second successive fifty.
Jaiswal hit five fours and six sixes before he fell to Karim Janat who struck twice in an over but Dube stood firm to steer the team home and get past his previous T20 best of 60 not out.
Earlier Naib, a top-order batsman, took on the Indian bowling attack in his 35-ball knock laced with five fours and four sixes.
He raised his fourth T20 half-century for Afghanistan but fell against the run of play when Patel got the batsman caught at short mid-wicket by Rohit.
Wickets kept tumbling, but Najibullah Zadran (23 off 21 balls), Janat (10-ball 20) and Mujeeb Ur Rahman (21 off nine) boosted the Afghanistan total.
The last over from left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh, who ended with three wickets, bro­ught four wickets including two run outs as Afghanistan were bowled out on the final ball.
Leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi took two wickets. The final match is on Wednesday in Bengaluru.
