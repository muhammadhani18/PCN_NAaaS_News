0,Can PTI bat without bat?,"Analysts think decision will be bad omen for ECP, judiciary in days to come","Famous superstitions like the black cat crossing the path, broken mirrors, eye twitching and the 13th day of the month falling on Friday or Tuesday is considered unlucky, but superstitions about lucky or unlucky numbers or days may seem true in some cases and just tall tales by desperate people in some other cases.
Though it was neither Friday nor Tuesday, the Dec 13 decision of the Supreme Court knocking out Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on some technical grounds on the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) plea apparently turned out to be nothing less than a cursed day for the PTI, triggering a debate whether the PTI can survive the setback or not in the run up to the general elections and after that.
For experts and political commentators, the top court’s ruling to deprive the PTI, being the former ruling and one of the most popular political parties of the country, of its election symbol of the cricket bat, will not only cause difficulties for the party but cast a long shadow on the general elections, upcoming government, parliament and democracy.
Renowned political experts, Zaigham Khan, and, Majid Nizami, while examining the situation on the political and electoral scene in the aftermath of the top court’s decision against the PTI, said that it’s a huge setback for the party, the decision has ended polls’ credibility and history will not judge the ECP, SC, among others, positively.
Zaigham, who is an anthropologist and development professional too, thinks that the PTI will survive as a party but the people will not be able to see it as a parliamentary party for the next five years, saying this will have an impact on the PTI’s overall fortunes as whatever has so far happened to the PTI is not the end of its misfortune.
“The pressure on the PTI will continue for next few years,” Zaigham said, adding that things may change as no one can surely predict the future. “Immense difficulties [lie] ahead but we will see it as a party as its vote bank will survive to a large extent.”

The PTI is a large party and when such parties are formed, Zaigham said, it has been seen that the vote bank remains intact for a generation and the emotional appeal continues.
To a question about possible horse-trading, Zaigham said that things will unfold once these the PTI candidates are elected independently, saying it will be interesting to see how many of them are elected in the first place.
However, he said, one thing is certain that they will face the pressure again, adding that the kind of pressure people have already seen will now come directly on the PTI members.
Zaigham noted that Pakistan has seen Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan formula as well as where people stay in their parties but the parties do not remain the same.
In this scenario, he predicted, chances are that someone might get a position in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa by forming a block.
“Elections’ credibility has already gone,” Zaigham said. “And as a result of it, the legitimacy of the [upcoming] government will also be in question and if the legitimacy of government is in question, then the legitimacy of parliament and democracy will also be in question; this all will have an impact on political stability.”
He felt “history will not judge the institutions positively”.
Firstly, Nizami noted, it’s a huge setback for the PTI as, initially, the nomination papers of its candidates were rejected and in the second setback, the party has been deprived of its party symbol.
“The PTI’s survival is difficult. They will have to work really hard. Twice as much as they are doing right now.”
Secondly, Nizami opined that horse-trading will legally be no longer a crime because the elected candidates would not be contesting with the PTI’s symbol on the ballot paper; hence, it couldn’t be technically called horse-trading. However, he added, morally it would be criticised a lot despite there being no legal bar on the elected people.
Thirdly, Nizami pointed out that the top court’s decision to deprive the PTI of its election symbol on the ECP’s plea will definitely have a severe impact on the upcoming elections, saying it will confuse the PTI voters as they will have to check what symbol has been allotted to a particular candidate in their constituency.
Historically, Nizami while referring to the bat saga said that it’s a big and crucial case and would continue to be discussed for years.
“Historians will question the quantum of punishment awarded to the PTI on the basis of some technicalities,” Nizami said, adding that the judiciary and ECP “will have to face accountability regarding this [move]”.
Apart from the general impact on the PTI and the bad things attributed with the number 13, popular singer Taylor Swift feels that the number 13 is good luck for her.

1,Will CJ Isa finally give relief to PTI?,Imran’ party losing hope after the SC’s Saturday order," 
After depriving the PTI of its election symbol, the Supreme Court is going to take up today the party’s petition seeking contempt proceedings against authorities, including the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), for violating its order about providing a level playing field to the party.
However, PTI supporters are depressed after the court’s Saturday ruling, with one section within the party urging the PTI legal team not to attend the hearing.
Interestingly, the same bench that restored the ECP's decision regarding the withdrawal of PTI's election symbol is hearing the contempt matter. Led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa, the bench comprises Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali.
Sources indicate that the PTI has yet to submit its written response to the ECP and Punjab government’s replies. Both respondents have rejected the PTI’s claim that their party is being persecuted.
Sardar Latif Khosa is representing the PTI in this case. The sources revealed that PTI legal minds have yet to finalize their legal strategy after the Saturday order.
CJ Qazi Faez Isa is facing severe criticism on account of Saturday's verdict. PTI lawyers have always faced a tough time in the court of Justice Isa. Justice Isa discussed the PTI's 2014 marathon sit-in in the Faizabad Dharna case judgment, issued in February 2019.
Following this judgment, the PTI challenged the case verdict, while the party-led government filed a presidential reference against the judge, accusing him of financial misconduct.
While the Supreme Judicial Council was holding proceedings on the misconduct complaint, PTI supporters were running a malicious campaign against Justice Isa and his family members, apparently at the behest of the security establishment, according to some analysts.
During the term of CJ Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Isa had taken notice of former prime minister Imran Khan’s participation in a lawyers’ convention organized by the PTI’s legal wing in Islamabad.
However, in February 2021, the apex court ruled that Justice Isa should not hear cases involving Imran Khan, who was serving as the prime minister then.

“The Hon Chief Justice of Pakistan [Gulzar Ahmed], therefore, observed that in these circumstances it would not be proper for the Hon Judge [Isa] to hear the matter considering that he had already filed a petition against the Prime Minister of Pakistan in his personal capacity.
“Therefore, to uphold the principle of unbiasedness and impartiality, it would be in the interest of justice that the Hon Judge should not hear matters involving the Prime Minister of Pakistan,” said a five-page order authored by CJ Ahmed.
Two former CJs—Gulzar Ahmed and Umar Ata Bandial—did not include Justice Isa in any larger or special bench hearing matters related to the PTI.
When Justice Isa became the CJ, some legal experts had noted that the judge’s biggest challenge would be how he would deal with cases related to the PTI.
Despite using social media, the PTI could not succeed in getting relief from Justice Isa. Although the SC led by CJ Isa is ensuring the holding of general elections on February 8, the credibility of elections is at stake after the withdrawal of the election symbol of the largest party in the country.
It is clear from Justice Isa's observations that he has serious concerns about the May 9 incidents.
The SC under CJ Isa has not entertained Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan's plea regarding the alleged enforced disappearance of PTI leaders, as well as Imran Khan's letter about the harassment of his party leaders.
PTI supporters are losing hope about getting relief from the CJ Isa-led bench, just as the PML-N lost hope of getting relief from CJ Saqib Nisar and the PPP from CJ Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry.
It will be interesting to see how the bench led by CJ Isa will restore the PTI's faith in the judiciary after Saturday's order.
After Saturday's order, the burden is not on the powerful circles or the ECP for not providing a level playing field to the PTI but on the apex court.

Police authorities have received directives to establish robust security clusters at polling stations, strategically identifying sensitive locations that may require the deployment of the Pakistan Army, Rangers, and the Quick Response Force (QRF).
Police officers are also tasked with furnishing details on the requisite number of closed-circuit TV cameras needed at highly sensitive and sensitive polling stations falling under the A category.
Meanwhile, the returning officers (ROs) also wrapped up the scrutiny of nomination papers for seats reserved for women and minorities in the national and four provincial assemblies.
Following the schedule outlined by the ECP, the window for appeals regarding the acceptance or rejection of nomination papers by ROs is open until January 16 (tomorrow).
The appellate tribunal will then take up these appeals for consideration until January 19.Women, minorities
Besides, the ECP has unveiled the roster of female and minority candidates in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Among the 70 candidates, 26 are vying for female seats, while 24 contenders are competing for the 4 minority-designated seats.
According to the ECP’s announcements, 27 candidates have contested for the National Assembly's women-reserved seats.
