1,Discourteous conduct of drivers irks commuters,"Citizens lament overcharging, frequent altercations on intra-city routes","Despite the convenience brought by metro buses, residents of the twin cities continue to face challenges from the discourteous behaviour of public van drivers on intra-city routes.
Many passengers, including the elderly, complain about impolite conduct and time wastage on vehicles operating along the Islamabad Expressway. Concerned citizens are urging the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to address these issues promptly and deploy recently acquired electric buses to connect densely populated areas on the outskirts of the federal capital.
The CDA recently received the initial batch of 30 electric buses, part of a larger procurement of 160 buses from China, aimed at providing eco-friendly transportation. According to the CDA media wing, following an agreement regarding the procurement of 160 electric buses from China, the first batch of the 30 new zero-emission buses arrived at the Zero Point bus terminal. As announced, the second batch of electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to arrive in February or March this year, and the denizens hope that it will be utilised to facilitate them.

Meanwhile, daily altercations over unfair charges persist in private vans, especially on routes like 136 and 124. Passengers report confrontations with illiterate conductors who fail to provide fare lists and often overcharge.
Ayesha Jabeen, a housewife, voiced concerns about the lack of checks on rude behaviour and overcrowding in public vans.
Issues also arise with CNG-equipped vans charging fares equivalent to those for petrol and diesel. Zubair Talha, a student, highlighted the absence of safety checks on CNG kits and the prolonged stops at various locations, causing unnecessary delays. Sajjad Azhar, a senior journalist, highlighted the need for electric buses to connect private societies around the Expressway with the metro bus network, providing relief to a significant population.
He specifically calls for the initiation of electric bus services from Bahria Town, linking various areas like Media Town, Police Foundation, PWD, Soan Garden, Pakistan Town, Jinnah Garden, Capital Enclave, and others with metro bus routes.
However, doubts linger among daily passengers regarding the immediate relief promised by the CDA's electric bus announcement.

2,Ban on rallies mutes Liaquat Bagh’s legacy,Prohibition on holding political gatherings has altered Rawalpindi’s poll landscape,"In anticipation of the upcoming national elections on February 8, the administration has imposed a ban on hosting political rallies at Liaquat Bagh, a historically significant venue in Rawalpindi formerly known as Company Bagh.
Once a vibrant centre for political gatherings during election seasons, this decision has led to a decline in political activities, forcing candidates to seek alternative venues like narrow streets, markets, wedding halls, and more.
Consequently, Liaquat Bagh, once a symbol of political popularity, will remain dull and barren during this election season.
Former Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, known for concluding every election with a rally in Liaquat Bagh, has announced that he will hold his final rally outside Lal Haveli on February 6. Political parties have been encouraged to hold rallies in larger cities in the spacious Parade Ground near Faizabad at the junction of the two cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad to avoid overcrowding and ensure compliance with the ban.
The park is currently administered by the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA), which has imposed an undisclosed ban on election rallies. Sources reveal that any political party attempting to hold a gathering at Liaquat Bagh will face substantial penalties.
Liaquat Bagh, once a vibrant political hub, has now transformed into Liaquat Park, witnessing a 60% reduction in its area. Instead of hosting political rallies, the ground now features colourful flowers, shady trees, a jogging track and benches for families. The district administration offices have been established in the vicinity, replacing the once-bustling political arena.
Two years ago, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) held gatherings in Liaquat Bagh with the High Court's approval, resulting in damages to its plants, benches, barriers, and the jogging track. As a consequence, they were slapped with heavy fines.
The park is currently administered by the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA), which has imposed an undisclosed ban on election rallies. The PHA’s ban has left the residents of the garrison city without the traditional political ambience of Liaquat Bagh during this election season.
With a history marked by three instances of bloodshed, including the assassinations of prime ministers Liaquat Ali Khan and Benazir Bhutto, and firing during the 1973 public meeting of the Awami National Party (ANP), Liaquat Bagh holds significant historical importance.
Originally a dense forest around 500 years ago, Liaquat Bagh and its surroundings witnessed the settlement of the oldest Aryan tribe before the establishment of Rawalpindi. The flowing Nullah Leh, once a crystal-clear stream, added to its significance. Arya Mohalla, adjacent to Liaquat Bagh, still exists today.

From 1880 to 1947, Hindu families used to perform rituals here, burning the remains of their dead in the transparent flowing stream, now known as Nullah Leh. They would also perform ablutions in this area. Hindu and Sikh women would wash utensils and clothes, while both men and women would take baths at this location.
The British military company used Liaquat Bagh for exercises during their cantonment establishment in the early 1900s. The venue served as a gathering point during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah initiated a movement to unite Muslims in the region during a significant gathering in 1936.
Over the years, Liaquat Bagh hosted gatherings addressed by prominent figures such as Quaid-e-Azam, Gandhi, Nehru, Master Tara Singh, Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad, Maulana Bhashani, Ataullah Shah Bukhari, former chief minister of Occupied Kashmir Farooq Abdullah, Wali Khan, Asghar Khan, Maulana Mufti Mahmood, Maulana Maududi, Maulana Shah Ahmed Noorani, Sardar Abdul Rab Nishtar, Khan Abdul Qayyum Khan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto.
Current political figures like Nawaz Sharif, Asif Ali Zardari, Bilawal Bhutto, and Dr Tahirul Qadri have also had the honour of addressing the gatherings held in this historic venue.
The venue’s original gathering capacity of 50,000 to 60,000 people has now been limited to only 7,000 people. Building a stage for gatherings here was a necessity. In front of it, there was a large pond and a fountain, which remained in existence for 100 years but has now been removed.
On the press club side, there was the Rawalpindi General Bus Stand from where buses would ply all over Pakistan. The bus stand was abolished in the Bhutto era in 1974 and shifted to Pirwadhai. The main entrance to the Company Bagh was from Murree Road, adjacent to the present Police 15 office. It had a 50-foot-wide central gate.
There was also an entrance from the Liaquat Road side, but it was called the side entrance. From the mid-60s to 2000, children and adults were seen playing cricket and other sports here from morning to evening. Next to it was the ancient arena of wrestlers. It is now a small remnant known as ‘Dad Pehalwan Akhara’.
On October 16, 1951, when the first prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan was martyred while addressing a gathering here, Company Bagh was renamed Liaquat Bagh in his honour, a name that persists to this day. On December 27, 2007, Benazir Bhutto was also martyred here after a gathering. A memorial monument in her honour has been constructed on one side.
In 1973, during a gathering led by Wali Khan of the National Awami Party (now ANP), a firing occurred, resulting in the deaths of 12 workers and injuries to several others. A case was registered at the City Police Station, in which former governor Ghulam Mustafa Khar, Iftikhar Tari, and Saeed Awan were the main accused, who were acquitted in 1997.
Now, 80 per cent of Liaquat Bagh’s area has been taken over. The bus stand has been replaced by the office of the solid waste management company, RWMC.
The entire area of the side has become the Rawalpindi Press Club. The central entry has been closed, and all the area has been given to Police 15.
A mosque was constructed in the centre. With the Press Club, the PHA office was established.

6,Rising inflation in Sunday Bazaars irks citizens,"Due to absence of formal price control system in bazaars, vendors have independently established prices of food items","The rising inflation in Sunday Bazaars of Rawalpindi has irked incoming buyers who expect to be able to purchase vegetables and fruits at reasonable rates but face disappointment after inquiring about the rates of commodities.
Moreover, due to the absence of a formal price control system in the bazaars, vendors have independently established prices of food items, which is making it even more difficult for poor and middle-class people to afford basic food items.
Currently, ginger is being sold at Rs400 per kg, onions at Rs200 per kg, potatoes for Rs80 per kg, tomatoes for Rs120 per kg, and cabbage for Rs120 per kg in the Sunday market of Rawalpindi Committee Chowk. People coming to the Sunday Bazaar hoping to get vegetables at reasonable rates were shocked to hear that garlic was being sold for Rs600, bitter melon for Rs150, green chillies for Rs400, and peas were being sold at Rs300 per kg. Similarly, prices of fruits were also exorbitantly high such that apples were being sold at Rs150 to 300 per kg and pomegranate for Rs300 per kg.

7,Chapli Kebab craze sweeps twin cities,Delectable delicacy provides a spicy respite from harsh winter,"Rawalpindi and Islamabad are currently experiencing a surge in demand for chapli kebab, a delectable Pakistani dish, as winter takes hold in the twin cities.
Known for its rich flavours, chapli kebab is gaining popularity beyond its traditional strongholds in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan, with an increasing presence in various commercial centres across Islamabad.
Residents are flocking to chapli kebab shops, seeking not only the mouthwatering taste but also the warmth it provides during the chilly season.
Kebab lover, Faheem Bhatti, explored the dual benefits and said aside from being a delightful treat, chapli kebab also offers a comforting source of warmth.

The dish is making its way to different areas in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, including Abpara Market, Melody Market, Karachi Company Market, Peshawar Mor, Bharakahu, Raja Bazaar, Saddar, Tench Bazaar, Lal Kurti Bazaar, Adiala Road, Scheme 3, Ratta Amral, Kashmiri Bazaar, and Rawat.
Shopkeeper Farooq Khan revealed the key ingredients in crafting the perfect chapli kebab, including boneless buffalo meat, onions, tomatoes, eggs, garam masala, and a blend of five spices, along with red and green chillies. The addition of pulp on top enhances the flavour before cooking.
Despite its roots as a local delicacy, chapli kebab has found its way into the hearts of Pakistanis abroad, who often order it as a nostalgic taste of home.
However, the rising prices of buffalo's boneless meat, coupled with increased gas prices, have led to an inflation-induced surge in chapli kebab prices. The cost of a 25-gram kebab has doubled from Rs200 to Rs400. This iconic dish, renowned for its affordability, is now facing challenges due to economic factors.

Arif Khan, a researcher of history and culture, sheds light on the origins of the term ""kebab,"" tracing it back to Persian roots, where it signifies cooking meat on a skewer. The historical context includes soldiers cooking meat on swords during ancient times when utensils were scarce.
While chapli kebab enjoys widespread popularity, cardiologist Dr Shahid raises a cautionary note. He points out that the consumption of beef, especially in the form of fat-prepared chapli kebabs, can lead to increased blood pressure.
Dr Shahid particularly advised heart and diabetes patients to be cautious, as the fat content in chapli kebabs may contribute to clogging heart arteries.
Despite these health considerations, the charm of chapli kebab persists, with its unique place in Pakistani cuisine, accessible to both the rich and the poor. The increase in demand during winter months has led to a proliferation of chapli kebab shops across the twin cities, catering to the diverse tastes of the population.
