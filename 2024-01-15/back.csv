0,PTI unveils online portal for voter engagement,"Post-SC decision, party shares election info on official website","Faced with the challenge of steering the election ship as independent candidates, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Sunday adopted a novel strategy to connect with voters in the run-up to the February 8 general elections to protect its base and visibility.
The party introduced a portal on its official website featuring comprehensive details of all candidates organised by constituency, providing a streamlined method for party workers and voters to access crucial information.The decision to create the portal comes in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's late-night ruling affirming the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) December 22 decision to deprive PTI of its distinctive poll symbol.
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said that following the SC’s verdict, party nominees will now contest elections as independent candidates, vowing to get votes in the name of party founder Imran Khan.
The ECP has allotted various symbols to the now-independent candidates and issued a list of the allotted symbols. As per the list, PTI’s Waseem Qadir from NA-121 and Sardar Latif Khosa from NA-122 were allotted the symbols of ‘wicket’ and alphabet ‘K’ respectively.

Afzal Azim from NA-123 was given the symbol of ‘radio’, while Advocate Zameer from NA-124 was allotted ‘dolphin’ as an electoral symbol. Zaheer Abbas from NA-127 got the symbol of ‘clock’, Salman Akram from NA-128 was allotted ‘racket’, and Mian Azhar from NA-129 with ‘wicket’.
Dr Yasmin Rashid from NA-130 got the electoral symbol of ‘laptop’, Nadeem Sherwani from NA-119 got ‘cricket stump’, Sohail Sultan from NA-4 Swat a ‘goat’, Ali Shah Khan from PK-4 was allotted ‘Khusa’ and Advocate Akhtar Khan from PK-5 a ‘pressure cooker’ symbol.
The apex court on Saturday set aside the January 10 order of the Peshawar High Court (PHC), effectively depriving the PTI of its iconic election symbol of the cricket bat in a major blow to the former ruling party ahead of the February 8 general elections.

Talking to the media after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, PTI lawyers said that following the court verdict, candidates will now contest polls as independents.
They added that PTI has already developed a strategy in this regard and urged the 'massive' voter base of the party to not worry about the current circumstances.
A key member of the PTI legal team, Barrister Ali Zafar said the party will fight the election vigorously, even after the apex court's decision to take the party’s electoral symbol of ‘bat’.
Zafar added that the party is still registered and the court has not barred its candidates from contesting the polls. “PTI has above 100 million voters, no one objected to the intra-party elections, but those not in the party did.
None of the 14 petitioners were a part of the party,” he added.Zafar further said that following the top court’s verdict, PTI will lose all reserved seats and will not get any reserved seats in the national or provincial assembly.

2,Torkham remains closed for second day,Hundreds of commercial vehicles stranded on both side of border," Torkham remains closed for the second consecutive day on Sunday, leaving hundreds of commercial vehicles stranded on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.
The blame game continues, with both sides pointing fingers at each other for the latest shutdown at the Torkham crossing, which began late Friday night, as per officials on either side who spoke to AFP.
On Friday, Afghan border official Abdul Jabbar Hekmat stated, ""Torkham is closed to commercial truck drivers without visas from Pakistani authorities.""
However, Pakistani officials on Saturday denied the imposition of a visa requirement. They clarified that the border was closed after Afghan counterparts were informed that truck drivers could only cross with a valid passport, a document many Afghans lack.
""In line with our updated policy, Afghan officials were informed last night that cargo drivers would only be allowed to enter our side if they possess a passport,"" explained a Pakistani customs official.

He emphasized that this regulation had been agreed upon in previous meetings between Afghan and Pakistani authorities on border rules. ""However, instead of adhering to the previously agreed-upon regulations, the Afghan border officials chose to close down border trade.""
The result of this disagreement is the stranding of hundreds of trucks at the crossing, although the border remains open to pedestrians.
Recent months have seen temporary closures of crossings between the two countries. Last year, Islamabad launched a massive operation against undocumented Afghans in Pakistan, leading to tightened document requirements for Afghans entering the country.
Pakistan and Afghanistan have experienced increasingly tense relations, with Islamabad accusing the Taliban government of not addressing militants staging attacks on Pakistan from Afghan soil—a claim denied by Kabul.
The Torkham crossing, located equidistant between Islamabad and Kabul, faced frequent closures last year, with tensions occasionally escalating into armed clashes between border guards across the frontier.

6,Solangi praises top court’s ‘bat’ ruling,"Speaking at Think Fest 2024, minister says it would be good for country if elections were held on time","Caretaker Federal Minister for Information, Broadcasting and Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Solangi said on Sunday that it was in the interest of all political forces and parties concerned that general elections should be held on February 8.
Speaking at the seventh edition of Think Fest 2024, the minister said it would be good for the country if the elections were held on the scheduled day i.e., Thursday, February 8.
The minister stressed that every political party should give its members the right to vote in the election of its office-bearers. He said in his opinion, Saturday’s Apex Court decision was a good precedent. It would have been better if there were legal experts in the panel who could explain the legal position, he added.
He reminded that it was clearly written in the preamble of the Constitution that Pakistan would be run by the elected representatives. The minister said that in the run-up to the elections, everyone was complaining about the level playing field.
The Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) were voicing their complaints in that regard while Maulana Fazlur Rehman also complained of a lack of level playing field in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
""In fact, the working class of Pakistan does not have a level playing field,"" Solangi maintained. Without a fundamental change in the system enabling the common man to contest elections, there would not be a level playing field, he remarked.

Terming political instability and economic survival of the country main challenges, Solangi said the next government might be facing economic issues.
""We need improvement in the economy. With the principal amount of the overall budget used for servicing big loans and other payments, it is difficult to run the country,"" he said.
The minister said that the agriculture contributed about a quarter of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), but the tax collection from the sector was very low.
Moreover, he added, the population was increasing rapidly, which was burdening the sectors like health and education. He said Pakistan was also bearing the brunt of climate change as well. ""We have to improve relations with our neighboring countries, as, otherwise, we cannot become economically strong,"" Solangi maintained.
About the protesters from Balochistan in Islamabad, he minister said that they were offered to hold their sit-in either at F-9 Park or H-9 but they insisted on going to the D Chowk in Red Zone. ""No group, be it political or religious, is allowed to enter the Red Zone,"" Solangi said.
He said the police had to take action when the protesters camping outside the National Press Club tried to enter the Red Zone. Later, the government's negotiation committee held talks with them and then the women and children arrested by the police were released first. Another 163 people were released in the second phase and finally the remaining 34 were also set free.
Medical facilities, including an ambulance were also provided to the protestors, he added. The Balochistan governor and other members of the committee persuaded the protesters to  go back peacefully, he said.
The minister said that there was a need of a negotiating committee having representation of major political parties that could give a better solution to this problem.
