The few dozen residents who had returned to Grindavik after an earlier eruption were urgently evacuated overnight Saturday, hours before the latest eruption started.Live video  showed fountains of molten rock and smoke spewing from fissures in the  ground across a wide area very close to the town of Grindavik.
“No  lives are in danger, although infrastructure may be under threat,”  Iceland’s President Gudni Johannesson said on social media site X,  adding there had been no interruptions to flights.
The eruption  began early on Sunday north of the town, which just hours before had  been evacuated for the second time since November over fears that an  outbreak was imminent amid a swarm of seismic activity, authorities  said.
Authorities built barriers of earth and rock in recent weeks  to try to prevent lava from reaching Grindavik, some 40km southwest of the capital Reykjavik, but the latest eruption appeared to  have penetrated the town’s defences.
“According to the first  images from the Coast Guard’s surveillance flig­ht, a crack has opened on  both sides of the defences that have begun to be built north of  Grindavk,” the Icelandic Meteorological Office IMO said.
Lava was  flowing towards the town and had come within an estimated 450 metres  (1,500 feet), the IMO said. The nearby geothermal spa Blue Lagoon had  closed on Sunday, it said on its website. Based on flow models, it  could take the lava a few hours to reach Grindavik if it continued to  flow towards the town, an IMO spokesperson told public broadcaster RUV.
“It is of course frightening to see how close this is to the town,” Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir told daily Morgunbladid.

1,Five die trying to cross Channel to UK in freezing cold,Fatalities are the first reported migrant deaths on the Channel in 2024 as maritime prefecture says more than 30 people rescued.,"CALAIS: Five migrants died and a sixth was in critical condition on Sunday after trying to reach Britain from northern France in freezing temperatures, the French maritime authority said.
More than 30 people were rescued, the maritime prefecture said in a statement. The fatalities were the first reported migrant deaths on the Channel in 2024. Authorities said four migrants died overnight, while a fifth body was found later on the beach.
The group was attempting to reach a vessel off the resort town of Wimereux when their small boat got into difficulty around two am, the maritime prefecture said.
The crew of a French tow vessel, the Abeille Normandie, went to the rescue and spotted  “unconscious and lifeless people” in the water, an official said, estimating the water temperature at nine degrees Celsius. Along the Wimereux embankment a journalist saw items of clothing and shoes abandoned by the migrants. The survivors were taken to a shelter in Calais.
‘Entire families’
According to the maritime prefecture more than 30 were rescued, but one person, had said around 70 migrants were brought in at around three am, including  “entire families with children, some of them very young”.
“Some of the survivors did not stay and told us they wanted to go to the Dunkirk train station to reach an accommodation centre in Armentieres,” the source added. Authorities launched an investigation into  “aggravated manslaughter” and other crimes, the Boulogne-sur-Mer public prosecutor’s office said.
Autopsies would determine the cause of death, which may be due to  “drowning” or  “thermal shock”, prosecutors said. Jean-Claude Lenoir, head of the Salam association, said migrants took huge risks by trying to board bigger vessels in the water in the current conditions.
“Migrants want to get on board at all costs,” he said.  “They quickly fall victim to hypothermia or drowning.” Twelve migrants lost their lives in 2023 trying to cross the Channel, according to the maritime prefecture.
The region around Calais, the jumping-off point for the shortest crossing to England, has long been a magnet for migrants.
More than two decades after the closure of a Red Cross centre in Sangatte, hundreds of people still live in tents and makeshift shelters near Calais and Dunkirk, hoping for a chance to make the crossing hidden in a truck or aboard a small boat.
The boats are a political priority for the British government and a bone of contention with France, as tens of thousands of people a year make the dangerous crossing.
‘Trade in human beings’
The British government has been pushing ahead with a plan to deport migrants, who arrived illegally on British soil, to Rwanda. “It breaks my heart, but it just shows we’ve got to stop the boats, we’ve got to stop this illegal trade in human beings,” British Foreign Minister David Cameron told the BBC, referring to the latest tragedy.
“The only way you can stop the boats is by busting the model of the people smugglers.” Labour opposition leader Keir Starmer, widely tipped to become prime minister later this year, said:  “To lose your life in a small dinghy or boats in the winter, in the Channel is just awful.”

2,22 miners killed in Tanzania landslide,"“These fellow Tanzanians were small miners in the area, trying to earn a living for themselves, their families and contributing to the development of our nation,” says President Samia Suluhu Hassan.","DAR SALAAM: Twenty-two people have lost their lives following a landslide at a mine in northern Tanzania, officials said on Sunday.
The accident occurred in Simuyu region’s Bariadi district, more than 500 kilometres north of the capital, Dodoma, burying the miners under heavy debris. “As we close the rescue operations, the death toll remains 22, all men,” Faustine Mtitu, acting commander for the region’s fire and rescue force, told reporters on Sunday.
“We are convinced that there are no more bodies trapped in the rubble,” he said, adding that safety procedures had not been followed at the mine.
President Samia Suluhu Hassan expressed her  “great sadness” over the accident, paying tribute to the victims on Sunday. “These fellow Tanzanians were small miners in the area, trying to earn a living for themselves, their families and contributing to the development of our nation,” she said in a post on X.
It was unclear when the landslide occurred and officials did not provide details on the cause of the accident. Tanzania is the fourth-largest African producer of gold, one of the East African nation’s main sources of foreign currency.
Mining accidents are not uncommon, with miners often lacking the tools and materials considered necessary to operate safely.Authorities suspected the collapse may have been caused by congestion after scores of miners entered the pit.
Tanzania and its East African neighbours Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia have all been facing torrential rains linked to the El Nino weather pattern. Seventy-six people were killed in landslides last month in the hillside town of Katesh in northern Tanzania.
The downpours last month also displaced 5,600 people and destroyed infrastructure in many parts of the country, forcing Hassan to cut short her participation in the COP28 climate talks in Dubai to deal with the disaster.

3,Rahul Gandhi begins second cross-country march,NEW DELHI: India’s main opposition leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday began a new cross-country march from a troubled...,"NEW DELHI: India’s main opposition leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday began a new cross-country march from a troubled northeastern state, aiming to generate political momentum to take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in general elections due by May.
The  “Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra”, or Unite India Justice March, comes weeks after Gandhis Congress party suffered shock defeats in elections in three states, puncturing the mood of the opposition which intends to challenge Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Gandhi walked for 3,500-km from the southern tip of India to held Kashmir in the north, ending a 135-day march in Jan 2023 in a move to help revive the Congress and his popularity.
The latest march, setting off from remote northeastern Manipur state will cover 6,713 kilometers over 66 days, passing through 15 states, with some of the journey via car. Gandhi decided to start in Manipur, a state that has witnessed fierce fighting since last year.
At least 180 people have died and thousands were displaced in clashes that erupted after a court order suggested privileges granted to minority Kukis also be extended to majority Meitei community.

More than 25 bushfires were burning in the vast state, with residents in the rural shires of Gingin and nearby Chittering, about 60 kms north of Perth, at risk from the fast-moving blaze, according to fire authorities. A high-risk bushfire season is underway in Australia due to an El Nino weather event, associated with events such as cyclones, droughts, heatwaves and wildfires.
A state Department of Fire and Emergency Services spokesperson said 240 firefighters were battling the blaze, which was at emergency level, the highest threat rating.
“If the way is clear, leave now for a safer place,” the agency said on its website. The blaze, which has burnt through 417 hectares of bushland, broke out on Saturday.
The nation’s weather forecaster issued a warning for  “extreme fire danger” in some parts of Western Australia state amid a heatwave alert in place since Saturday.
In Perth, a maximum temperature of 35 degrees Celsius was forecast, more than three degrees above the city’s average January maximum.

5,US presidential election heats up as frigid Iowa tests Trump,DES MOINES: Voters venture into sub-zero temperatures on Monday to kick off the Republican presidential nomination...,"DES MOINES: Voters venture into sub-zero temperatures on Monday to kick off the Republican presidential nomination race with the Iowa caucuses, the first major test of whether runaway front-runner Donald Trump is as much of a sure thing as he appears.
With a commanding lead in polls, the ex-president is expected to win the Midwestern state’s first-in-the-nation vote easily as he bids to be the Republican standard-bearer against President Joe Biden in November. But Iowans may have to contend with the coldest conditions in the modern era of presidential election campaigns, with blizzards and a potential wind chill of -26 degrees Fahrenheit (-32 degrees Celsius) forecast.
Trump and his leading rivals, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, were forced to cancel appearances in the home stretch as the threat to Monday’s turnout added intrigue to a campaign season that is already something of an unknown quantity. Trump canceled three weekend rallies, but was still due to hold a campaign event on Sunday in Indianola, just south of Des Moines.
Despite his apparent strength, the former president has been indicted four times since he was last a candidate and is preparing for the potential collapse of his business empire in his native New York in a civil fraud trial.
“If DeSantis’s massive ground effort, coupled with a recent Haley surge, can drag Trump under 50 per cent by several points, that will be the first meaningful sign that Trump can be defeated,” said political analyst Alex Avetoom, who worked on Republican John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign.
“However, this paradigm-shifting reality — that Trump could be defeated — happens if, and only if, the rest of the field consolidates behind one anti-Trump candidate.” 
Poor predictor
For all the talk of miracle bounces, the Iowa race is hardly competitive: A new NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll has Trump at 48pc among likely caucus-goers, with Haley surging into second place but still only at 20pc.
“I’m voting for Trump again,” 37-year-old trucker Jeff Nikolas said, adding that  “he may be bullheaded, but he can actually get stuff done.” The poll was more bad news for Florida Governor DeSantis, who scored just 16pc and has seen his claim to be heir apparent to the post-Trump Republican Party eclipsed by Haley.
But DeSantis insisted that his  “very motivated” backers would turn out in sufficient numbers — despite the frigid conditions — to keep him relevant in a vote that is open only to registered Republicans.
In 2016, he told ABC, only 186,000 Iowans took part in the caucus, and  “now, with this weather, it could be significantly less,” making turnout paramount. He urged his supporters:  “Bring in friends and family, man, that’s going to pack a punch.” Haley, a former South Carolina governor, is looking to outperform expectations to cement her claim to be Trump’s top challenger going into her preferred state of New Hampshire the following week.
Iowa is a notoriously poor predictor of the eventual nominee but it is considered crucial for winnowing the field and as a springboard to the next few battlegrounds, which include Haley’s home state.

After a final horse-drawn carriage procession through the streets of Copenhagen, the hugely popular 83-year-old queen signed a declaration of abdication at Christiansborg Palace, ending her 52-year reign and automatically making her son monarch.
She then left the Council of State, also attended by the government, the new king, his wife and their 18-year-old eldest son, the new Crown Prince Christian. Margrethe left the room with tears in her eyes, saying:  “God bless the king.” In front of a sea of Danes waving red-and-white flags, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen then proclaimed 55-year-old Frederik the new king on the balcony of Christiansborg Palace, the seat of parliament and government.
Wraped up against the cold, a visibly moved Frederik, clad in his gala admiral’s uniform with gold epaulettes, blinked back tears and smiled as he waved to the crowd, estimated at more than 100,000 people by media outlets. Like his mother, Frederik is hugely popular, enjoying the support of more than 80 per cent of Danes.
“My mother succeeded like few others in becoming one with her country,” he told the crowd. “My hope is to become a unifying king for the future... It’s a responsibility I assume with respect, pride and a lot of happiness,” he said, repeatedly placing his hand on his heart as the crowd cheered.

7,Sanders pushes to halt US military aid to Israel over rights concerns,Says “this is not just another war — this is wholesale destruction.”,"WASHINGTON: Bernie Sanders, a US senator and presidential hopeful, brings a resolution to the Senate floor on Tuesday, directing the State Department to look into potential human rights violations by Israel in Gaza.
The resolution, if passed, would allow Congress to vote on terminating further military assistance to Israel based on the State Department’s findings. The White House, however, has expressed its opposition to the resolution, which mandates the State Department to issue a report on how Israel’s weapons are used during its military campaign in Gaza.
“We do not believe that this resolution is the right vehicle to address these issues,” White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters in Washington. “And we don’t think now is the right time.” But Sanders disagrees with the argument.
“In essence, we will be voting on a very simple question: whether human rights violations may have occurred using US equipment or assistance in this war?”
Referring to “widespread civilian harm” in Gaza, Sanders said the situation needs urgent attention because “this is not just another war — this is wholesale destruction.”
In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Sanders said the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza “is worse than” what happened in Dresden, Germany during World War II.
“If I use the word Dresden Germany with you, you think about the horrific destruction during World War II of that city. What is going on in Gaza now in three months is worse than what took place in Dresden over a two-year period. This is a catastrophe,” he explained.
The resolution invokes Section 502B of the US Foreign Assistance Act, allowing Congress to vote on soliciting information regarding the human rights record of any country receiving US security assistance.
Sanders, who introduced the resolution in December, plans to bring it to a floor vote this week. He argues that Israel, utilizing US-supplied weapons, has employed military tactics leading to widespread death, destruction, and starvation in Gaza.
He points to extensive evidence of what he describes as the most intensive bombing campaign of the 21st century, with over 26,000 Palestinians killed, predominantly women and children.
Israel, as the largest recipient of US foreign aid, receives billions worth of military equipment. Sanders acknowledges Israel’s right to defend itself but emphasises that it does not have the right to wage war against innocent civilians in Gaza.
“Given the scale of the destruction and the extensive use of US arms in this campaign, including thousands of massive 2,000-pound bombs, Congress must act to conduct real oversight,” Sanders said.
This resolution raises questions about the US’s role and responsibility in conflicts where its supplied weapons are involved, setting the stage for a crucial debate in the Senate.
In Sunday talk shows, Sanders said Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorist attacks but “you do not have a right to go to war against an entire people, women, and children.”
The US Congress, he argued, “must act because a lot of this destruction is being done with military weapons supplied by the United States of America.”
Sanders also rejected the suggestion that he was targeting Israel. “If American military assistance is given to any country, Saudi Arabia, Israel, any other country, it has got to be used consistent with human rights, international human rights standards and American law,” he explained.
“In my opinion, that is certainly not the case. We have a horrific humanitarian catastrophe. We cannot turn our backs on it. Congress has got to start moving to protect children in Palestine.”
Meanwhile, some US media outlets reported on Sunday that the Biden administration “keeps pressing Israel to reengage with Palestinians as partners once fighting in Gaza is over and support their eventual independence,” but Israeli “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu keeps saying no.”
Even on actions to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians, “the two allies are far apart,” the report added.
The report pointed out that the United States remains Israel’s closest ally and largest weapons supplier, and “has stronger means to apply pressure on Israel; it shows no willingness to use them.”

8,"Israel ‘failed’ in Gaza  and will negotiate,  says Hezbollah chief",Security of all shipping harmed after US strikes on Yemen,"BEIRUT: The head of Hezbollah movement said on Sunday that Israel had failed to achieve its objectives in Gaza and this will force it to negotiate.
“What has the enemy achieved in 100 days, other than killing?” Hassan Nasrallah asked in a televised speech.
“It has not achieved any real victory or semblance of victory. It has failed in achieving its declared, half-declared and implicit objectives,” he added, on the 100th day of the Israeli aggression.
Nasrallah’s speech commemorated the death of a senior Hezbollah commander, Wissam Tawil, killed by Israel in southern Lebanon on January 8. “If this path continues, be it in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Yemen or Iraq, the enemy government will have no other choice but to accept the conditions of the resistance in Gaza, thereby putting an end to the aggression against Gaza and entering into negotiations,” said Nasrallah.
The Hezbollah leader also denounced air strikes by the US and Britain, which on Friday hit scores of rebel targets in Yemen in response to the Houthis’ attacks on shipping.

Security of all shipping harmed after US strikes on Yemen

“What the Americans did in the Red Sea will harm the security of all maritime navigation,” Nasrallah said.
In more than three months of violence on the Israel-Lebanon border, 190 people have been killed in Lebanon, including 141 Hezbollah fighters and more than 20 civilians, according to a tally.
On Sunday, Israeli authorities announced that two Israelis had been killed by a missile fired from Lebanon that hit a house near the border.
Israel’s military also said it killed three gunmen who had crossed the frontier and  “fired at the forces”.

9,N. Korea fires ballistic missile of intermediate range,"SEOUL: North Korea fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile on Sunday, Seoul’s military said, days after...","SEOUL: North Korea fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile on Sunday, Seoul’s military said, days after Pyongyang staged live-fire exercises near the country’s tense maritime border with South Korea.
“Our military detected one suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile launched from the Pyongyang area towards the East Sea at around 14:55 (0555 GMT),” Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.
The missile flew 1,000km, the JCS added, saying that authorities in Seoul, Washington and Tokyo were analysing the specifications.
“We strongly condemn the latest missile launch by North Korea as it is a clear provocation that seriously threatens peace and stability on the Korean peninsula,” it said.
Japan’s coast guard also confirmed a suspected missile launch by North Korea, citing information from the country’s defence ministry, and warning vessels to take care.
North Korea’s last missile test was of a Hwasong-18 solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which it fired into the East Sea on December 18.
The apparent test comes days after North Korea conducted a series of rare live-fire drills near its maritime border with the South, prompting counter-exercises and evacuation orders for some South Korean border islands.
Leader Kim Jong Un earlier this week branded Seoul his “principal enemy” and warned he would not hesitate to annihilate South Korea, as he toured major weapons factories.
“The historic time has come at last when we should define as a state most hostile toward the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea the entity called the Republic of Korea (South Korea),” Kim was reported as saying by the official Korean Central News Agency. 
Analysts said at the time that the change in language was significant, signifying a shift in Pyongyang’s approach to an “ultra-hawkish mode”.

10,83 countries hold Ukraine talks,"""Every minute that we wait, dozens of civilians in Ukraine are killed or wounded. We have no right to wait forever,"" says Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis.","DAVOS: More than 80 countries held talks on Sunday seeking common ground on Ukraine’s peace formula, as the Swiss co-hosts admitted that including Russia in negotiations remains some way off.
National security advisers from 83 countries held a fourth round of discussions based on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s 10-point proposals for a lasting and just peace in Ukraine.
The talks were co-chaired by Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak, who heads Zelensky’s office, and Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis.
“The purpose is to prepare so that we are ready and ripe to launch a process with Russia — when the time comes,” Cassis told a press conference.
He said the talks had to find a way to include Russia at some point, but thus far, neither Kyiv nor Moscow was ready to take such a step.
The meeting was being held in the luxury ski resort of Davos in eastern Switzerland, on the eve of the five-day World Economic Forum. Zelensky is due to travel to Switzerland on Monday and will visit the annual summit of the globe’s business and political elite.
Yermak said the talks were open, constructive and detailed on the key principles in reaching a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine”.
While there were differences on how to achieve peace, “we are very joined in the main principles if independence, territorial integrity, sovereignty and the norm of international law and the statutes of United Nations”, he told a press conference.
Cassis said the involvement of Brazil, India and South Africa in the talks — countries that sit alongside Russia in the BRICS group — was highly important as they were still in dialogue with Moscow.
Yermak said Ukraine was looking at hosting summits with African countries and with South American nations to explain its position more broadly.
He added that he had not been pressed to offer Ukrainian territorial concessions, saying Ukraine was still fighting and will “obviously win this war”.
In an earlier press conference, Cassis noted: “We will need to find a path to include Russia in the process. There will be no peace without Russia having its word to say.” However, he added that “every minute that we wait, dozens of civilians in Ukraine are killed or wounded. We have no right to wait forever”.

11,"Israel’s attack is ‘harder’ than Nakba, say Palestinians displaced in 1948","RAFAH: At age 89, Palestinian Liga Jabr remembers how conflict uprooted her family when she was a child. Now, 75...","

Rayqa Abu Aweideh

 
RAFAH: At age 89, Palestinian Liga Jabr remembers how conflict uprooted her family when she was a child. Now, 75 years later, she says the brutality raging in Gaza is even worse.
“This war is harder than any of the displacements” brought by previous conflicts, Jabr said in Rafah refugee camp, on the besieged Gaza Strip’s southern border with Egypt.
Staying with relatives after her home in central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah was hit by a strike, Jabr is among an estimated 1.9 million Palestinians forced from their homes since crisis erupted on Oct 7 in the Hamas-ruled territory. Sitting by a small wooden table in a house crowded with family members, she said she has felt fear like never before as the crisis entered its 100th day.
“To be honest... I’m afraid,” she said.  “I have never seen a war like this one. This war is disgraceful.” The violence has spurred concerns that Israel is trying to expel Palestinians, but Israeli officials deny this.
That scenario evokes dark historical memories of what the Arab world calls the  “Nakba” or catastrophe — the mass displacement of Palestinians during the war that coincided with Israel’s creation in 1948.
The majority of Gaza’s 2.4 million inhabitants are descendents of some of the 760,000 Palestinians driven out during that war. Some, like Jabr, have now lived through both conflicts.
‘Destroying entire houses’
In 1948 Israeli soldiers  “did not kill us in the Nakba”, she said, recalling how her family left on foot from the Palestinian village of Julis, now in southern Israel, just over 10 kilometres north of the Gaza Strip.
“Now the Israelis are hitting people from the air and destroying entire houses,” Jabr added as drones buzzed outside. She lost about a dozen relatives when her house in Deir el-Balah was  “demolished” in an air strike, she said.


Liga Jabr

 
Rayqa Abu Aweideh, a relative of Jabr who like her had to leave her home in what is now southern Israel in 1948, said the current war is  “harder and crueller”.
Seventy-five years after fleeing Al-Majdal with her family and two cows, and eventually settling in southern Gaza’s Khan Yunis, Abu Aweideh was displaced again, taking shelter at her daughter’s home in Rafah.
Born in 1935, Abu Aweideh said the current unrest has extinguished any hope of ever returning to her hometown, and that now she wouldn’t want to flee Gaza. “Even if they tell me, ‘take all the money in the world’, I will never leave for Sinai or anywhere else,” she said, referring to the Egyptian peninsula bordering the Palestinian territory. “I want to stay here even if we die.” 
Always ‘afraid’
Juma Abu Qamar, 80, said he wanted to return to the Palestinian village of Yibna where he was born, now in central Israel, but admitted he didn’t believe it would ever happen. “We had a big house with a fig tree,” he recalled.
During the 1948 war,  “we didn’t see the Jewish (soldiers). We walked along the shore until we reached Gaza”.
