• Feb 8 proving to be ‘unsuitable’ for KP, says resolution
ISLAMABAD: As electioneering in the country has only started gathering momentum, yet another resolution has landed in the Senate Secretariat in an attempt to press the relevant authorities to delay the general elections, scheduled to be held on Feb 8.
An independent senator, Hilalur Reh­m­an, hailing from the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), submitted the resolution seeking delay in the polls due to harsh weather and deteriorating security situation, increasing terrorist attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northern parts of the country.
The resolution said candidates in KP were under severe threat of terrorist attacks, which created a wave of fear and deprivation among people. The scheduled date of elections in KP proved unsuitable and therefore the elections should be conducted on an appropriate date and not on Feb 8, it added.
This is the fourth resolution filed within a few days about elections. The first one introduced by independent Senator Dilawar Khan on Jan 5 received support primarily from Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) senators and was passed by a quorum-less session of the upper house of parliament.
Seeking the postponement of the general elections over security and bad weather concerns, the resolution, despite later being widely condemned, appeared to have the tacit support of some other parties as well. While the absence of lawmakers from mainstream political parties on the day had raised several questions, PPP senator Bahramand Tangi not only kept silent at the time of the voice vote, but also delivered a speech, highlighting the need for peace before polls. He was later issued a show-cause notice by the PPP for deviating from the party policy.
The passage of the resolution was subsequently condemned by politicians and lawyers, who termed it a “conspiracy against democracy” and asserted that polls be held on time.
While the resolution passed by the Senate was not binding on the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and did not affect the schedule of the elections on Feb 8, a series of resolutions seeking delay in the polls have fuelled speculations and added to the prevailing uncertainty among people and political forces about the fate of the vote at a time when elections are only 22 days away.
Emphasising the need to adhere to “constitutional requirements” and to ensure the timely conduct of the polls, another resolution was submitted in the Senate by Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan. Last week, senators belonging to the PTI, PPP and Jamaat-i-Islami also requisitioned a session to discuss the timely conduct of free and fair polls.
Later, an independent senator, Hidayatullah, filed another resolution in the upper house of parliament, seeking delay in polls.
The resolution referred to the surge in acts of terrorism and violence in the country, with particular reference to armed attacks in North Waziristan, Bajaur and Turbat, causing severe injuries to a veteran nationalist politician running for national and provincial assembly seats, and killing of another candidate. The resolution said the incidents had perturbed the country and created an environment of insecurity.
The resolution urged the ECP and the Supreme Court to sympathetically consider the conduct of peaceful elections and postpone the polls for three months in view of the security challenges. During this time, the resolution said, the government should create an environment guaranteeing a level playing field to all political parties and candidates.
KP in focus
On Sunday, a fourth resolution demanding a delay in polls was submitted to the Senate Secretariat by an independent senator from KP, Hilalur Rehman. The resolution mentioned cold weather and increasing incidents of terrorism in KP as reasons to amend the election schedule.
It stated that the increasingly cold weather and snow were not providing a conducive environment for citizens to cast their votes and were also creating challenges for candidates trying to run their election campaign.
“In the same way, due to security concerns in the country, especially in KP, candidates are facing threats of terrorist attacks while campaigning,” it said, adding that it was also creating obstacles and limiting candidates’ participation in their campaigns.
The resolution said that the people of the province and candidates, especially those belonging to erstwhile Fata, were being affected due to these factors.
Sense of deprivation
It added that due to the increasing “sense of deprivation” and the fear of citizens in KP about being left out of the election process, the date announced for the general election was proving to be “unsuitable” for the province.
It urged the ECP to delay polls to a date which was acceptable for all the relevant stakeholders and that would also help in removing hurdles in the way of free and fair elections.

1,ECP moves to ensure quota for women on general seats,Commission asks political parties to submit list of their candidates within five days.,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to ensure compliance with the poll rules, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Sunday told the political parties to submit their candidates’ list to the watchdog within five days to ensure that at least five per cent of women candidates are allocated general seats under Section 206 of the Elections Act, 2017.
According to a statement issued by the ECP, “The political parties, having been allocated election symbols for general elections 2024, are mandatorily required to ensure five per cent representation of women candidates on general seats under the provisions of Section 206 of the Elections Act, 2017.
“All political parties concerned are, therefore, requested to submit the list of male/female candidates on general seats (to whom party tickets have been issued) to ECP within five days of this press rele­ase,” said the statement on Sunday.
It may be noted that the PTI, which lost its electoral symbol on Saturday night, had fielded 20 women nominees for general seats out of a total of 234 candidates.
 
 

However, since the party is without a symbol, all of its candidates will contest the elections independently. A PTI list of 234 candidates for 266 seats of the National Assembly carried the names of 20 women candidates.

Commission asks political parties to submit list of their candidates within five days

Speaking to Dawn, PPP Senator Taj Haider, who is in charge of the PPP’s central election cell, said the party has allocated more than five per cent of seats to women candidates. He added that the PPP had allocated tickets to women in constituencies where the party was likely to sweep polls. He mentioned PPP candidate Savera Parkash, who is contesting from Bannu for a general seat, saying that she has even garnered the media spotlight.
He also said that the amendment for the aforementioned law to bolster the number of women in parliament was tabled by the PPP in a parliamentary committee.
 
 

PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui said the party’s quota for women also exceeded five per cent as the ECP rules mandate. He added that PML-N chief organiser Maryam Nawaz has particularly focused on the participation of women in electoral politics.
According to the PML-N senator, the ECP should have issued this directive seeking compliance with Section 206 sooner so that the political parties could have ensured the fielding of women candidates on general seats before the award of party tickets. He said the PML-N had finalised its manifesto and after its approval by Nawaz Sharif, the party would unveil the document this week.

2,PPP raises alarm over poll symbol mix-up in Punjab,Says ROs have allotted ‘kettle’ to the candidate for Lahore's PP-163 and 'wheelchair' to PP-119 candidate instead of 'arrow'.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has raised concerns about the allotment of incorrect election symbols to two of its Punjab Assembly candidates and written to the Election Commission to fix the issue.
In a letter, Senator Taj Haider, the official in charge of PPP’s central election cell, informed the chief election commissioner that a returning officer had allotted the ‘kettle’ instead of the ‘arrow’ as an electoral symbol to Fayyaz Bhatti, the PPP’s candidate for Lahore’s provincial constituency PP-163.
 






“I am writing to you to express my deep concern over the irregularity in the allotment of election symbol to PPP candidate Muha­m­m­ad Fayyaz Bhatti from PP-163, Punjab,” Mr Haider said.
“It is learned that Muhammad Fayyaz Bhatti had submitted his PPP ticket to the concerned returning officer on Jan 12, 2024, but still the returning officer listed him as an independent candidate and allotted him the kettle as the election symbol instead of the arrow, which is the PPP’s election symbol,” he added.
Similarly, another Pakistan Peoples Party candidate — Mujahid Islam, from the PP-119 constituency — has been allotted the “wheelchair” as an election symbol instead of the arrow, Senator Haider said in another letter to the chief election commissioner.
 
 

“In Punjab, the nominees of the PPP are being deprived of the arrow symbol,” Mr Haider lamented.
He said that this unexpected irregularity raised serious concerns about the integrity of the electoral process and the party feared that it might be a deliberate attempt to undermine the PPP candidates and could compromise the transparency of the election process.
He urged the chief election commissioner to take timely action to remove this irregularity by ensuring the allotment of the correct symbols to party candidates, besides investigating the reasons behind these mistakes by the returning officers.
The issue of incorrect election symbols for the PPP candidates comes as the party’s election campaign led by its chairman, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, has been in full swing in Punjab.
On several occasions, Mr Bhutto-Zardari has complained about the alleged historical discrimination against his party in the province. In a recent interaction with the media, he said the PPP could perform well in Punjab this time if provided a level playing field in the province.
Apart from filing his National Assembly nomination papers from Larkana, Mr Bhutto-Zardari will also contest from Lahore’s NA-127 seat, where he will compete against PML-N leader Ataullah Tarar.
The popularity graph of the PPP in terms of National and Punjab Assembly seats in the province has been on the decline since 2002.

3,Jahangir Tareen kicks off campaign with pledges of prosperity,"Promises to eliminate ""sense of deprivation"" from south Punjab.","LAHORE: Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) patron-in-chief Jahangir Khan Tareen has formally launched his election campaign with pledges to address the issues faced by voters.
Speaking at a workers’ convention in Multan, the IPP leader expressed his desire to steer the country towards prosperity.
The sugar baron, who is contesting the election for two seats — NA-149 (Multan) and NA-155 (Lodhran) — promised all-out efforts to serve his voters.
 
 

He mentioned that his party was contesting the election from several constituencies apart from the seat adjustment with PML-N.

Promises to eliminate ‘sense of deprivation’ from south Punjab

He also emphasised his connection with Multan, likening it to his hometown, Lodhran.
He pledged to prioritise the city’s problems and promised a new era of development and prosperity in his constituency.
The IPP leader vowed to eliminate the sense of deprivation felt by the people of south Punjab and voiced his belief in the eventual formation of the south Punjab province.
He concluded that no one should have a media trial and acknowledged that while problems exist in every part of the country, inflation and poor economy are the biggest issues.
 
 

“Elections will be held on time,” Mr Tareen reassured and said that after winning, his first priority will be fixing the economy and controlling inflation.
Reflecting on his time with PTI, Mr Tareen acknowledged the party’s promising start on the country’s political landscape and his own role in it.
However, he refrained from detailing what led to the animosity between him and the party leader Imran Khan.
The IPP leader has received support from former local lawmakers Aamir Saeed Ansari, Zahiruddin Alizai, Deputy Mayor Haji Saeed Ahmad Ansari, and other political leaders, including Aamir Manzoor Ansari, Akhtar Alam Qureshi and Qazi Naeem Islam.
Mr Tareen is one of the candidates announced by IPP on over 50 National and Punjab Assembly seats.
For its first election, the party has entered into an agreement with the PML-N, which has left seven NA and 11 Punjab Assembly seats vacant for top IPP leaders. However, on the Lodhran seat, PML-N has awarded the ticket to Saddique Baloch against Mr Tareen.
The IPP’s president, Aleem Khan, has got tickets from NA-117 and PP-149 in Lahore. The ticket for NA-54 (Taxila-Rawalpindi) has been award­ed to Ghulam Sarwar Khan. Both are a part of the seat adjustment agreement with PML-N.

4,PTI banks on social media to make up for ‘bat’ loss,"Sets up portal featuring its candidates, electoral symbols; party leader says will woo voters through ""door-to-door"", online campaigns.","• Former ruling party sets up portal featuring its candidates, electoral symbols
• PTI leader says will woo voters through ‘door-to-door’, online campaigns
ISLAMABAD / PESHAWAR: After it was deprived of its electoral symbol by the Election Commission, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has decided to capitalise on its strong social media network to remain in touch with its supporters in addition to setting up a portal featuring the party’s candidates alongside their electoral symbols for Feb 8 polls.
In a statement on ‘X’, formerly Twitter, the former ruling party said a portal to search for candidates and their symbols had been created. “See video below showing a search for ‘NA-1’ and the results with candidate name and symbol. We are just waiting for data for each candidate before we go live! #ChallengeAccepted,” the tweet read.
 






PTI Information Secretary Raoof Hasan said the portal would be fully functional within two days. “There will be two separate portals for the National and provincial assemblies. We will share the links of these portals through social media sites and our voters will be able to identify the national and provincial assembly candidates backed by the PTI for their constituencies,” he told Dawn.
Mr Hasan said that voters will only need to enter the number of a constituency in the portal and the candidate supported by the PTI along with the symbol will pop up.
 
 

A day earlier, the Election Commission of Pakistan allotted separate symbols to PTI candidates, instead of the ‘bat’, after the Supreme Court upheld an ECP ruling stripping the PTI of its electoral symbol on Saturday night.
Since the PTI candidates do not have a joint platform to contest elections, this portal will facilitate them to identify the nominees contesting elections with the backing of the PTI.
‘Door-to-door campaign’
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the PTI had remained in power for two consecutive terms, the Imran-led party has decided to use its social media network and a door-to-door campaign to inform its voters.
“The PTI has nominated candidates for each national and provincial assembly’s seat in the province, who have been allotted different election symbols by the ECP,” Ikram Khatana, the social media head of PTI’s KP chapter told Dawn.
According to the PTI leader, they will approach the masses through popular social media platforms to seek votes for the PTI candidates and also inform them about the name and symbol of each candidate vying for the national and provincial seats. “The workers would record short videos of the corner meetings, workers’ conventions, rallies and other activities related to the election campaign which would be then shared on the social media in the respective constituencies,” Mr Khatana said.
“Keeping in view the popularity of social media, it will only take a few hours to communicate to the masses, particularly the PTI voters, about the symbols allotted to the PTI-backed candidates in each constituency,” he said.
Mr Khatana further said that WhatsApp groups have already been formed on the local level for the effective communication of the party messages regarding the elections.
Hassan Khan, a party worker and resident of Kohat Road, told Dawn that they will use social media platforms to inform the masses about the PTI’s nominated candidates and the symbols allotted to them to remove any confusion.
For instance, PTI’s PK-84 nominee Fazal Ilahi was allocated the symbol of ‘badge’ and it only took, Hassan Khan said, a couple of hours to know about the electoral symbol allotted to Mr Ilahi. He claimed that the PTI voters were using Facebook to share the picture and symbol of Fazal Ilahi and added that a similar pattern would be repeated countrywide.
 
 

The symbols allotted to PTI’s nominated candidates who will contest elections as independent candidates include dove, sickle, dolphin, cot, pillow, racket, pomegranate, aeroplane, kettle, wheelchair, fan, tea cup, wall clock, pressure cooker, goat, frying pan, and green chilli.
PTI’s Ali Muhammad Khan and Muhammad Atif from Mardan got ‘dolphin’, and ‘sickle’, respectively. Asad Qaiser got ‘wheelchair’, Shehram Tarakai was allotted ‘dove’, Dr Amjid from Swat got ‘kettle’. Shaukat Yousafzai from Shangla was allotted ‘racket’, Kamran Bangash got ‘violin’, Taimur Saleem Jhagra received ‘table’, and Mehmood Jan got ‘wall clock’ among others.
