ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the government was committed to purging the country of the deadly poliovirus.
The prime minister, during a meeting with a delegation of Rotary Foundation, headed by International PolioPlus Committee Chairman Michael McGovern, said he would continue to personally monitor the efforts for elimination of polio from the country.
He said the services of Rotary Foundation and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for a polio-free Pakistan were appreciable, adding that the government was ensuring the security of polio workers.
The prime minister appreciated Rotary International for development of a housing project for the victims of 2022 floods. He directed the authorities concerned to devise a comprehensive strategy for the upcoming polio vaccination drive.

Orders foolproof security for polio workers

The prime minister was informed that this year, Rotary International and other partner organisations had allocated $15 million for anti-polio drives.
Apprising the prime minister of the current status of anti-polio campaigns, the relevant authorities said a special drive would be launched in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The prime minister instructed the law enforcement agencies to ensure foolproof security for the polio workers. He also directed the officers of the Ministry of National Health to make full preparations for the success of the upcoming polio vaccination drive.
The officer-bearers of Rotary International, incl­u­ding Aziz Memon, Faiz Kidwai, Adnan Rohela, and officials of the relevant ministries attended the meeting.

1,US Senate panel wants tensions de-escalated,"“I support de-escalation efforts and call for the immediate restoration of public access to internet services,” says Senator Bob Menendez.","WASHINGTON: A powerful committee of the US Senate urged the government of Pakistan on Thursday to immediately restore internet services across the country and de-escalate tensions.
In a statement, also pos­ted on its official social media accounts, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee said it was “closely monitoring the dev­elopments in Pakistan,” which it described as ‘concerning’.
“I support de-escalation efforts and call for the immediate restoration of public access to internet services,” the committee’s chairman Senator Bob Menendez said in the statement.
“These shutdowns dangerously suppress the Pakistani people’s freedoms, including access to information.”
The committee plays a key role in shaping US foreign policies, allocates funds for the implementation of those policies, and has the power to approve or reject all diplomatic appointments.
Meanwhile, the UN rights chief urged Pakistan security forces to show “restraint” and said “protesters should refrain from violence”, after the former prime minister Imran Khan’s arrest sparked nationwide civil unrest.
“Freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and rule of law are key to resolving political conflicts — with no place for disproportionate force,” the United Nations High Commissioner for Human rights Volker Turk tweeted, according to AFP.
Date for elections
A US senator has urged the US State Department to ask the government of Pakistan to fix a date for elections while other lawmakers said they were monitoring the situation very carefully.
Also, PTI supporters in the United States welcomed the Supreme Court’s order to release Imran Khan but continued their protest against the government’s crackdown on party workers across Pakistan.
“I am concerned about the situation in Pakistan. I have been following it very closely,” Senator Chris Van Hollen told VOA Deewa, a Pashto news show for Pakistan.
“I intend today to talk to some of our key people at the State Department about the situation there.”
The Democratic senator, who was born in Karachi, said: “Pakistan needs to get on track towards elections” to end the current political crisis.
He said that in his conversation with the State Department officials he would emphasise the need to “make sure that we agree upon dates for elections. So that people in Pakistan get to choose their leaders in a free and fair way”.

2,Pakistan capable of dealing with internal matters: FO,"Spokesperson replies to statements on Imran’s arrest, subsequent violence; rules out talks with TTP.","ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office has said that Pakistan is capable of dealing with its internal matters in accordance with the Constitution and law.
The remarks came in reply to the statements from the UN secretary-general, foreign countries and missions in Pakistan following the arrest of PTI chief Imran Khan and the subsequent violence.
“We have noted the statements that have come on the current situation in Pakistan and we remind them all that Pakistan has the full ability to deal with all domestic challenges in accordance with our laws and Constitution,” Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said on Thursday.
‘No talks with TTP’
Addressing the weekly press conference, Ms Baloch also ruled out talks with Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) saying there would be no dialogues with groups who do not respect Pakistan’s laws and Constitution.

Spokesperson replies to statements on Imran’s arrest, subsequent violence; rules out talks with TTP

Her remarks came days after Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi urged Pakistan and the TTP to revive the talks which broke down last year after the latter called off the ceasefire agreement.
“[W]e ask that the government of Pakistan and the TTP sit together and find a solution to these problems on their own,” said Mr Muttaqi who was in Islamabad last week for the Pakistan, Afghanistan and China Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue.
Responding to questions on Mr Muttaqi’s remarks, the spokesperson said this issue was clearly addressed in the statement following the trilateral dialogue.
In the statement, the three sides underscored the need to tackle security challenges posing serious threats to regional peace and stability, she said.
“They agreed not to allow their territories to be used by any individual group or party, including the TTP and [other groups] to conduct terrorist activities.”
Jaishankar’s remarks ‘baseless, unfortunate’
The spokesperson was also asked about the Indian external affairs minister’s remarks on Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s statement at the Shanghai Cooperation Organi­sation (SCO) Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in Goa earlier this month. “It should not have come as a surprise to anyone,” Ms Baloch said, calling the remarks “unfortunate and baseless”.
“We are surprised at the tone and tenor of the remarks that have come from the Indian side. It reflects their frustration when confronted with the truth.”
She said Pakistan made the right decision to participate in the SCO meeting as it showed “our commitment to the forum.”
“Our position was consistent with our long-standing position on various issues including on the situation in India-held Kashmir.”
Ms Baloch also welcomed the return of Syria into the Arab League. “We see this as a positive development and we hope that it will contribute to regional peace and security.”

3,Britain moves first to supply Ukraine with long-range cruise missiles,The Kremlin earlier said that if Britain provided these missiles it would require “an adequate response from our military”.,"LONDON: Britain on Thursday became the first country to start supplying Ukraine with long-range cruise missiles, which will allow Ukrainian forces to hit Russian troops and supply dumps deep behind the front lines.
Ukraine has been asking for months for long-range missiles, but support provided by Britain and other allies such as the United States has previously been limited to shorter range weapons.
Highlighting what he called the deliberate targeting of civilians, Britain’s Defence Minister Ben Wallace told parliament: “Russia must recognise that its actions alone have led to such systems being provided.”
Wallace said Britain was supplying the Storm Shadow missiles to Ukraine so they could be used within its territory, implying he had received assurances from Ukraine that they would not be used to target inside Russia.
The Kremlin earlier said that if Britain provided these missiles it would require “an adequate response from our military”.
Storm Shadows, manufactured by European missile maker MBDA, are air-launched long-range missiles, designed for attacks against high-value targets such as hardened bunkers and have a range of more than 250km.
After the United States, Britain has been the second-largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine contributing $2.9 billion worth of support last year.
Wallace said the British supply of Storm Shadows would be enough to meet Ukraine’s current demand.
He also referred to a possible second wave of missile supplies by a British-led group of European countries, which last week asked companies for expressions of interest to supply Ukraine with missiles with a range of up to 300 km.
Wallace said one of the main challenges supplying the weapons was finding a way to incorporate a British-French designed weapon onto Russian-designed aircraft used by Ukrainian forces.

4,Over 71m internally displaced in 2022,"Eight million Pakistanis forced from their homes by ""monster floods""; Sub-Saharan Africa saw around 16.5m displacements.","GENEVA: A ‘perfect storm’ of overlapping crises forced tens of millions to flee within their own country last year, sending the number of internally displaced people to a record high, monitors said on Thursday.
An unprecedented 71.1 million internally displaced people (IDPs) were registered in 2022 — up 20 per cent from a year earlier — amid mass displacement for Russia’s war in Ukraine, as well as by the monsoon floods that drenched Pakistan.
A full 60.9m new internal displacements were meanwhile reported in 2022, with some people forced to flee multiple times during the year, according to a joint report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) and the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).
That number is “extremely high”, IDMC chief Alexandra Bilak said.

Eight million Pakistanis forced from homes by floods

“Much of the increase is caused, of course, by the war in Ukraine, but also by floods in Pakistan, by new and ongoing conflicts across the world, and by a number of sudden and slow onset disasters that we’ve seen from the Americas all the way to the Pacific.”
‘Very volatile’
Last year, new internal displacements from conflict surged to 28.3m — nearly doubling from a year earlier and three times higher than the annual average over the past decade.
Beyond the 17m displacements inside Ukraine last year, eight million were forced from their homes by Pakistan’s monster floods.
Sub-Saharan Africa saw around 16.5m displacements — more than half of them due to conflict, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Ethiopia.
The global internal displacement figures are only expected to grow this year, driven in part by fresh conflicts like the violence ravaging Sudan forcing hundreds of thousands to flee.
‘Food security crisis’
While internal displacement is a global phenomenon, nearly three quarters of the world’s IDPs live in just 10 countries: Syria, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ukraine, Colombia, Ethiopia, Yemen, Nigeria, Somalia and Sudan.
Many of them remain displaced due to unresolved conflicts that have dragged on for years and continued to force people to flee their homes last year.
And even as conflict-related displacement surged, natural disasters continued to account for most new internal displacement, spurring 32.6m such movements in 2022 — up 40pc from a year earlier.
NRC chief Jan Egeland described the overlapping crises spurring ever more displacement around the world as a “perfect storm”.
“Conflict and disasters combined last year to aggravate people’s pre-existing vulnerabilities and inequalities, triggering displacement on a scale never seen before,” he said in a statement.
“The war in Ukraine also fuelled a global food security crisis that hit the internally displaced hardest,” he said.
“This perfect storm has undermined years of progress made in reducing global hunger and malnutrition”.

5,Violence escalates as Palestinian death toll rises to 28,EU urges both sides to halt fighting,"

GAZA CITY: Israel and Gaza fighters traded more heavy fire on Thursday, the third day of the worst escalation of violence in months that has killed 28 people in the blockaded Palestinian enclave and one in Israel.
Air strikes by the Israeli army since Tuesday have killed civilians, including several children, said officials in the crowded coastal territory.
Rocket fire from Gaza killed one person in the central Israeli city of Rehovot and injured at least two others, Israeli police claimed.
Cairo mediated in efforts toward a truce between Israel and the Islamic Jihad, while the European Union called for an immediate ceasefire.

EU urges both sides to halt fighting

“We urge an immediate comprehensive ceasefire which will end Israeli military operations in Gaza and current rocket firing against Israel, which is unacceptable,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock hosted her French and Jordanian counterparts for talks in Berlin and said “the bloodletting must end now”.
Military claimed 547 rockets have fired from Gaza Strip at Israel since Wednesday, adding that 175 had been intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defence system.
Shops in Gaza were shuttered and the streets largely abandoned as Israeli military aircraft circled over the territory where several buildings lay in ruins.
Islamic Jihad confirmed it has lost five leaders in strikes in recent days, including Ahmed Abu Deka — the deputy of Ali Ghali, commander of a rocket launch unit also killed by Israel on Thursday.
The Israeli army said it had fired at 166 targets across Gaza on Thursday.
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said four of its fighters had been killed.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said he had instructed the security establishment “to take all the measures necessary, to prepare additional actions and maintain readiness for the possibility of increased fire”.
‘Wave of escalation’
In Gaza City’s Al-Rimal district, Mamoun Radi, 48, said: “We hope that the wave of escalation will end, but we support revenge for the martyrs.
“Israel assassinated a leader of (Islamic) Jihad at dawn today because it does not want calm.” Across southern Israel, sirens wailed intermittently through the night and on Thursday morning.
Miriam Keren, 78, an Ashkelon resident, said a Gaza rocket had destroyed a workshop and damaged her house.
“All the shrapnel is in the room; the house was shaken very powerfully, the glasses fell, the walls were damaged,” she said.
“Luckily I have a safe room and I entered it immediately and closed the door”, she added.
“This isn’t the first time the house was hit but I’m not afraid, neither was I yesterday. You’re shocked for a moment but it’s not about fear. It’s more unpleasant, very unpleasant.”
Ceasefire efforts
An Islamic Jihad source said senior member Mohammad al-Hindi, who heads the group’s political bureau, arrived on Thursday in Cairo for talks with Egyptian intelligence officials.
An Egyptian source said a security delegation from Cairo would be in Tel Aviv for talks with Israeli officials on a ceasefire.
Israeli officials confirmed Egypt’s involvement in attempts to facilitate understandings between the sides toward halting the hostilities.
On Thursday, US ambassador to Israel Tom Nides said “we stand by Israel’s right to defend itself”, adding that Washington was engaged in efforts “towards a quick de-escalation”.
This week’s violence in Gaza are the worst since a three-day escalation in August killed 49 Palestinians, with no Israeli fatalities.
Violence has also flared in the occupied West Bank, where the Israeli army has staged repeated raids against Palestinians.
On Thursday, two Palestinians died from their wounds after being shot by the Israeli army in a raid the day before in the West Bank city of Qabatiya, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The conflict has escalated since veteran leader Benjamin Netanyahu returned to power late last year, heading a coalition with extreme right and ultra-Orthodox parties.
Netanyahu has warned, saying “we see you everywhere, you cannot hide, and we choose the place and time to hit you”.
Israel has also been shaken by its biggest domestic political crisis in decades as mass protests have flared against plans to reform the justice system, spearheaded by Netanyahu who is also battling corruption charges in court.
