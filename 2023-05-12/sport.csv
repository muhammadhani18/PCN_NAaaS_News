Stephens was coming off a singles title at a smaller clay-court event in Saint Malo, France, while Azarenka lost her singles opener in Madrid. 
“I was definitely quite nervous before the match,” Azarenka said. “I felt like I didn’t have too many matches under my belt and Sloane just won the tournament, so I knew she’s in a good form, so I just tried to kind of stay focused on myself.” 
The strategy worked, as Azarenka overpowered Stephens with baseline winners, plus a drop-shot winner to conclude a long rally midway through the second set when she broke for a 4-2 lead. 
Azarenka is making her 14th appearance at the Foro Italico, having reached the final in 2013, when she lost to Serena Williams. This year, Azarenka has reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open and won the doubles title last week with Beatriz Haddad Maia, who she’s partnering again in Rome. 
Last year’s French Open runner-up, Coco Gauff, routed Yulia Putintseva 6-0, 6-1. Karolina Pliskova, the 2019 Rome champion and two-time runner-up, was eliminated by Hungarian qualifier Anna Bondar 7-6 (7-5), 6-2; Wang Xiyu defeated Madrid quarter-finalist Irina-Camelia Begu 6-4, 7-5; and 11th-seeded Veronika Kudermetova won. 
In men’s action, Albert Ramos-Vinolas rallied past Italian wild card Francesco Passaro 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 to set up a rematch with Carlos Alcaraz. Alcaraz won their five-setter at last year’s French Open. 
Lorenzo Sonego celebrated his 28th birthday with a dominant 6-2, 6-1 win over Jeremy Chardy. 
Also, David Goffin rallied past 19-year-old Luca Nardi 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 on Campo Centrale and will next play 2017 champion Alexander Zverev; and German qualifier Daniel Altmaier beat Italian wild card Giulio Zeppieri 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 6-0 on the picturesque statue-lined Pietrangeli court. 
On Wednesday night, Fabio Fognini edged out Andy Murray in a battle of veteran tennis dads to reach the second round. 
Fognini, ranked outside of the top 100 for the first time in 14 years, came through 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 against his fellow 35-year-old. 
Next up for Fognini is a clash with Miomir Kecmanovic while 42nd-ranked Murray, the 2016 champion in Rome, licks his wounds after celebrating his first title since 2019 at the Aix-en-Provence Challenger on Sunday. 
Australian qualifier Thanasi Kokkinakis was leading Jaume Munar 4-2 in the first set when his Spanish opponent retired due to lower back pain. Kokkinakis will next face local favourite Jannik Sinner. 
Arthur Fils, another rising 18-year-old French player, beat fellow qualifier Juan Manuel Cerundolo 6-1, 1-6, 6-4 for his first Masters 1000 victory, setting up a meeting with Holger Rune. 
Wu Yibing of China rallied past French veteran Richard Gasquet 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 for his first tour win on clay. 
Rome is the last big warmup before the French Open starts at the end of the month.

1,PCB revises ‘hybrid model’ in attempt to keep Asia Cup hosting,A possibility of the tournament being held in Sri Lanka is also on the cards.,"KARACHI: In an attempt to quash concerns by the Bangladesh and Sri Lankan cricket authorities over the proposed ‘hybrid model’ for this year’s Asia Cup, the Pakistan Cricket Board has put forward a revised version of it.
The Bangladesh Cricket Board and Sri Lanka Cricket had reportedly objected over travelling to and from host country Pakistan to the United Arab Emirates — the neutral venue proposed in the original “hybrid model” — and also had concerns over the hot weather in the Middle East during September, when the Asia Cup is scheduled to be held.
The ‘hybrid model’ was originally proposed by the PCB during an Asian Cricket Council meeting in Bahrain last month to ensure at least a part of the tournament is held in Pakistan after India had categorically rejected travelling across the border.
The proposal, which was presented by the PCB three days ago, if accepted by the ACC members, will see Pakistan host only four matches of the initial group stage before the remaining matches, including the final — regardless of India being involved — are held at a neutral venue.
A possibility of the tournament being held in Sri Lanka is also on the cards with the SLC having offered to organise it while Pakistan remain the official hosts.
“I’m quite surprised that this idea is being floated unofficially by Sri Lanka and by Bangladesh,” the PCB’s interim committee chairman Najam Sethi told BBC on Thursday.
“The only objection Bangladesh raised was that it would be too hot in September in the UAE.
“The other objection was over logistics; ‘how are we going to go to and fro from Pakistan and the neutral venue.’ The proposal that I gave to them, three days ago, takes care of all the logistical problems.
“We play four matches in Pakistan, the teams come straight to Pakistan and we play four matches there and then everybody moves to the neutral venue, wherever that is, and we play the rest of the matches there.
“And I’ve made the concession that in the event Pakistan gets into the final, we will play the final in the neutral venue, even if it’s against India or against anybody else.”
If the “hybrid model” is not entertained, Sethi hinted, Pakistan would not play the Asia Cup, with the 74-year-old adding that it would mean the tournament losing its commercial value.
“In the last ACC meeting, which was about a month ago, we all agreed to two things; we agreed that it was imperative that Pakistan play the Asia cup, without Pakistan they can’t play the Asia Cup,” said Sethi.
“Nearly 80 per cent of the revenues of the Asia Cup are from the India-Pakistan matches, of which — the way the schedule is structured — we play at least two of those possibly three if both of us get into the finals.”
Although the revised ‘hybrid model’ would see Pakistan compromise on the number of matches at their home soil, hosting the Asia Cup is key for the PCB’s long-term goals.
According to Dawn’s understanding, the board wants to prove its reliability as well as that of the country as an able host of a top international cricket tournament with one eye on the ICC Champions Trophy, which Pakistan are scheduled to host in 2025
For the PCB and the Pakistan government, it is also about giving out the message that Pakistan is a safe and secure place for sports and cricket in particular.
The ‘hybrid model’ coming into play would also mean that Pakistan would expect it to be adopted during the World Cup as well with the 50-over showpiece set to be held in India in October-November.
Reiterating PCB’s stance in interviews published on Indian media outlets on Thursday, Sethi said Pakistan would play their World Cup matches at a neutral venue as well. He was of the view that the model was the way to go considering the tense political relations between India and Pakistan, which might come in the way again ahead of the 2025 Champions Trophy.
“If India now wants to have a neutral venue and accepts the hybrid model, then we’ll use the same hybrid model in the World Cup,” he said. “Pakistan can play its World Cup matches in Dhaka or any other venue to which India agrees, and similarly in the Champions Trophy.
“So all the other countries can come and play in Pakistan but India can play at a neutral venue. So this is a model that goes forward and resolves this political logjam.”
Few reports in the Indian media on Wednesday had claimed that the Pakistan-India World Cup match was to be held in Ahmedabad — where riots against Muslims are common and anti-Pakistan sentiment prevails.
Sethi said he felt such reports were coming out to discourage Pakistan from participating in the World Cup.
“When I heard that the Pakistan match was to be in Ahmedabad, I smiled and said to myself: ‘this is one way to make sure we don’t come to India’. I mean if you’d said Chennai or Kolkata, it might have made sense,” he said.
Meanwhile, according to a report by the Press Trust of India news agency on Wednesday, the ICC has got no written assurance from the PCB over its Pakistan’s participation in the World Cup even as impasse regarding the Asia Cup continues.
“India coming to Pakistan and Pakis­tan going to India doesn’t depend either on BCCI or PCB,” an ICC board member privy to developments told PTI. “So, PCB can’t give any assurance to ICC about its participation in the global event.
“It is the Pakistan government that will give approval just like in case of BCCI, it can only come to PCB subject to government clearance.”

The National Games are due to begin from May 22 in Quetta with the sporting extravaganza returning to Balochistan for the first time since 2004 and more than 6,000 athletes due to take part across 32 different disciplines.
Speaking at the Torch Relay Ceremony at the Pakistan Sports Complex, the IPC minister reiterated that the federal government was making “all out efforts to promote sports in the country”. “The PSB will also set up training camps to prepare athletes for the Asian Games [later this year].”
Mr Mazari was the chief guest at the ceremony with Pakistan Sports Board director general Shoaib Khoso also present. Others attending the ceremony included Islamabad Olympic Association interim committee chairman Rana Mohammad Sarwar and officials of the Pakistan Olympic Association.
The IPC minister handed the torch to former Olympic sprinter Sadaf Siddiqui to start the relay in Islamabad. The torch will next move to Azad Kashmir before reaching Quetta before the start of the Games.

3,Schedule delay leaves World Cup without buzz five months out,"England, who hold both white-ball World Cups, are the dominant force in short-format cricket."," 

The International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup 2019 Trophy, is seen during its tour at the National Stadium in Karachi, Pakistan October 7, 2018. — Reuters

NEW DELHI: With the match schedule still under wraps and the main title contenders preoccupied with Test cricket, there is a distinct lack of buzz around the 50-overs World Cup five months out from its expected start in October.
The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) has said the dates and venues for the 13th edition of the showpiece tournament would be out in “due course” and the host Indian board maintains the same.
“The discussion with the ICC is going on and we’ll soon announce the dates and venues,” a senior official at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said.
That would come only after the Indian Premier League (IPL) concludes on May 28, according to media reports in India.
While the lack of information, which is unusual for a major sporting event, might be annoying for fans planning to travel to India it is unlikely to impact too much on the preparations of the eight teams already qualified.
England, who hold both white-ball World Cups, are the dominant force in short-format cricket even if their immediate focus is on reclaiming the Ashes from Australia in the Test series beginning next month.
Jofra Archer is a doubt for that series because of a nagging elbow injury and white-ball captain Jos Buttler will be hoping the speedster is back to full fitness before the World Cup.
The reigning champions have also left the door open for Ben Stokes to return to the one-day fold if the all-rounder, the hero of the 2019 final, reconsiders his shock ODI retirement.
England’s laboured 2-1 ODI series win in Bangladesh in March was followed by a shock 3-0 submission in the Twenty20 leg of that tour, which will have erased any trace of complacency.
India won the World Cup last time they hosted the tournament in 2011 but Rohit Sharma’s side do not have a settled look.
Pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has been sidelined since September last year with a back injury and is missing the IPL as well as next month’s World Test Championship (WTC) final against Australia.
Stumper-batsman Rishabh Pant is likely to miss the World Cup as he continues to recover from multiple injuries sustained in a horrific car crash last December.
FAMILIAR CONDITIONS
Five-time champions Australia are also preoccupied with the WTC final at the Oval, which will be followed quickly by the Ashes.
Pat Cummins and his men toured India earlier this year, losing the Test series but prevailing in the one-dayers.
With 14 Australian cricketers, including several frontline players, involved in the IPL, at least the conditions will look familiar when they return for the World Cup.
Among the other hopefuls, New Zealand, who lost the 2019 final on boundary count, are almost certain to be without Kane Williamson after the skipper suffered a serious knee injury in the ongoing IPL.
Williamson’s absence would make it the first ODI World Cup where not a single team returns with the same captain as they had in the previous edition.
While their best batsman may still travel as a team mentor, Tom Latham is likely to lead New Zealand ahead of Test skipper Tim Southee. “That’s something that still needs to be worked out,” coach Gary Stead said on Tuesday. “Tim’s captain in the test team as well, but Tom’s had a lot of white-ball experience for us in the past.”
Former champions Pakistan have grounds for optimism after their top order and pace attack fired them to a 4-1 series victory over a weakened New Zealand earlier this month.
Pakistan briefly held the number one ODI ranking during the series and skipper Babar Azam currently leads the batting rankings with team-mates Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq also in the top four.
“Winning the series is great and so is achieving number one ranking that has set us in a good position for the World Cup,” Babar said.
South Africa claimed the last direct qualification spot but former champions West Indies and Sri Lanka will compete with eight other teams for the remaining two slots for the tournament in India.

4,Two more handed suspended  jail terms in Tokyo Olympics scandal,TOKYO: Two Japanese businessmen were handed suspended prison sentences on Thursday in the latest convictions in a...,"TOKYO: Two Japanese businessmen were handed suspended prison sentences on Thursday in the latest convictions in a bribery scandal surrounding the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
Corruption allegations have spiralled in the aftermath of the pandemic-delayed Games, implicating major companies and damaging Japan’s bid to host the 2030 Winter Olympics in Sapporo.
Shigeharu Hisamatsu, a 64-year-old former executive at advertising firm ADK Holdings, received a sentence of 18 months, suspended for three years, a Tokyo District Court spokesman told AFP.
His former assistant, 61-year-old Toshiaki Tada, was given a sentence of one year, also suspended for three years.
The pair did not contest charges during their first hearing in March that they bribed a Tokyo Olympics committee member, according to local media.
The pair were arrested along with former ADK president Shinichi Ueno in October last year.
Local media reported that Ueno admitted in a court hearing in February that he paid over $100,000 to Haruyuki Takahashi, who is facing several separate bribery charges and has reportedly pleaded not guilty.
Last month, the former chairman of a high-street business suit retailer and sponsor of the Tokyo Games became the first person to be convicted in the bribery scandal.
Hironori Aoki, the 84-year-old head of Aoki Holdings, received a suspended prison sentence of two and a half years.
Other parties involved in bribery allegations include a major publishing firm and a merchandise company licensed to sell soft toys of the Games’ mascots.
As investigations continue, the country’s Olympic chief warned last month that Japan could push its Winter Olympics bid back four years to 2034.
Japanese Olympic Committee president Yasuhiro Yamashita said it would be  “difficult to move ahead without gaining people’s understanding” following the scandals.

6,Centurion Haseebullah gives Shaheens massive lead,"KWEKWE: Haseebullah Khan’s unbeaten century and half-centuries from Hussain Talat, Moham­mad Huraira and Omair ...","KWEKWE: Haseebullah Khan’s unbeaten century and half-centuries from Hussain Talat, Moham­mad Huraira and Omair Bin Yousuf put Pakistan Shaheens in a commanding position against Zimbabwe ‘A’ at the close of second day’s play in their second four-day match at the Kwekwe Sports Club.
At stumps, Pakistan Shaheens in their first innings had reached 461 for eight off 112 overs, leading by 298 runs in response to the first innings total of 163 posted by Zimbabwe ‘A’. Batting at number seven, wicket-keeper/batter Haseebullah cracked an unbeaten 111 off 197 deliveries hitting 14 fours and a six. The 20-year-old’s second first-class century helped the tourists take charge.  
Earlier resuming their first innings at the overnight score of 115 for one, Mohammad Huraira (60 not out) and Omair Bin Yousuf (19 not out) could add only 12 runs to their partnership before Huraira (64, 86 balls) became the first batter to be dismissed. Kamran Ghulam (2) soon followed Huraira as Shaheens were 133-3.
Omair was joined by vice-captain Hussain Talat and the pair knitted 84 runs for the fourth wicket. Omair brought up his half-century but was bowled by Roy Kaia for a 96-ball 65, smashing six fours and one six. Qasim Akram joined Hussain and the pair stitched a 66-run partnership for the fifth wicket before Hussain (74, 100 balls) and Qasim (36, 55 balls) returned to the hut in the space of 14 balls as both batters fell to fast bowler Victor Nyauchi.
At 293 for six and a lead of just 130 runs, wicket-keeper/batter Haseebullah and all-rounder Aamir Jamal added crucial 83 runs. After the dismissal of Aamir (35, 47 balls), Mehran Mumtaz joined Haseebullah adding 36 runs for the eighth wicket. 
After the departure of Mehran (12), Mohammad Ali and Haseebullah recorded an unbroken 49-run partnership for the ninth wicket.
For Zimbabwe ‘A’, Tanaka Chivanga and Victor Nyauchi picked three wickets each.
The Shaheens won the first four-day match of the series by eight wickets at the same venue.  
Summarised scores:
ZIMBABWE ‘A’ 163 in 56.4 overs (Tadiwanashe Marumani 66, Dion Myers 50; Mohammad Ali 4-36, Mehran Mumtaz 3-36, Aamir Jamal 3-51)

7,‘One small step’ left for Inzaghi’s CL final dream with Inter,MILAN: Simone Inzaghi can already see his Inter Milan team in next month’s Champions League final after an...,"MILAN: Simone Inzaghi can already see his Inter Milan team in next month’s Champions League final after an impressive 2-0 win over local rivals AC Milan in the last four on Wednesday. 
Inter grabbed two early goals through Edin Dzeko and Henrikh Mkhitaryan and need to avoid a collapse in the second leg back at the San Siro on Tuesday in order to reach a clash with either Real Mad­rid or Manchester City in Istanbul. 
And coach Inzaghi was in confident mood after watching his team dominate the first leg, missing several chances to make the scoreline humiliating for their cross-town rivals. 
“We played a brilliant first half, but it’s a tight scoreline for what we did out there,” Inzaghi told reporters. “Then in the second half we managed the game well. Apart from [Sandro] Tonali’s shot [which hit the post] the boys did great in covering the whole pitch. 
“It’s a hugely positive night which gives us a lot of satisfaction but we’re missing one more piece to attain a dream that we believed in since August. There are still seven days left. We know we’ve got one more small step to go.” 
Milan could have star man Rafael Leao back for Tuesday’s second leg after the Portugal winger missed Wednesday’s match with a thigh injury. 
Leao is crucial to Milan’s attack and his absence made Inter’s job that much easier, but Inzaghi isn’t worried about the 23-year-old’s potential return next week. 
“We have played loads of derbies with Leao playing and without him playing,” said Inzaghi. “He’s a great player who is very important for them but it won’t change our plan for the match.” 
Milan manager Stefano Pioli remained optimistic despite the dispiriting loss which he put down to their opponents’ clinical finishing. 
“The reality is that Inter performed better in the first half, scoring two goals, while Milan showed improvement in the second half but failed to find the net,” Pioli told Amazon Prime Italia. 
The loss to Inter was Milan’s third defeat by their neighbours in a single season, something they have not experienced since the 1994-95 campaign. 
Milan secured a 3-2 win over Inter in Serie A in September before suffering back-to-back defeats, 3-0 in the Italian Super Cup and 1-0 in Serie A. 
Pioli, however, praised his team’s resilience as they bid to stay on course to win the European Cup for the eighth time, 16 years after their last triumph in 2007. 
“We had the chances in the second half so naturally, in the second leg, we need more quality and a more aggressive attitude,” he said. 
“I know my players, I know we can do better... next week’s match will be psychologically very difficult for both teams because we have the chance to reach the final,” Pioli told reporters. 
“We have the chance to score some goals, put them under pressure and set right what’s happened. It’s difficult, it won’t be a walk in the park. It will be difficult but we have to believe because football has taught us that you can overcome all sorts of obstacles.” 
FAST START 
The biggest Milan derby of a generation saw Inter beat their neighbours for the first time in a Euro­pean knockout tie, with Milan progressing from both previous meetings, most recently in the 2004-05 Champions League quarter-finals. 
Inter made a fast start, scoring after eight and 11 minutes, with Dzeko smashing in a close-range volley before Mkhitaryan doubled the lead from Federico Dimarco’s cross to stun their city rivals at the San Siro. 
Milan were shell-shocked and although they improved in the second half, they rarely threatened a comeback and face an uphill task to stay on course to win their eighth European Cup. 
“Right from the first minute we had a great desire to win,” player of the match Mkhitaryan told Prime Video. “But it’s not over yet. A great battle awaits us.” 
Bosnian striker Dzeko, 37, became the second oldest player to score in a Champions League semi-final after Manchester United’s Ryan Giggs.  
“Sometimes you get in this difficult moment where the ball doesn’t want to go in,” Dzeko told Prime Video after his third goal since January. 
“I was calm knowing the goals would come as always,” Dzeko said. 
Inter could have won by a wider margin as Hakan Calhanoglu smashed a shot off the post and Dzeko wasted a great chance early in the second half, but they are still heavy favourites to reach the final of Europe’s top club competition for the first time since they last won it 13 years ago. 
Milan have their work cut out if they want to have a chance at being crowned European champions for the eighth time. 
“We conceded two quick goals, and against Inter that’s difficult to come back from,” Milan def­ender Fikayo Tomori told Prime Video. “We’re disappointed, we could have done better, especially at the beginning, but we need to believe if we’re going to reach the final.”

9,Dhoni reinvents himself to remain useful in IPL,Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming says Dhoni has tailored a customised training to prepare for the role.,"NEW DELHI: It has been nearly four years since Mahendra Singh Dhoni quit international cricket, but the 41-year-old continues to deliver the goods for Chennai Super Kings after reinventing himself as a lower-order enforcer with the bat this season.
Dhoni retired from the international duties in 2019 as India’s most successful captain, having led the team to the T20 World Cup title in 2007 and the 50-over crown four years later.
He masterminded Chennai Super Kings’ four successful campaigns in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and remains immensely popular in Chennai, where people affectionately call him ‘Thala’, which means ‘leader’ in Tamil.
Widely regarded as a master tactician, Dhoni is also known for his swashbuckling batting — best illustrated by his unbeaten 183 against Pakistan in a 2005 one-day international in Jaipur.
Although he cannot reprise those knocks of his prime, Dhoni is producing useful cameos, usually at number eight, to help Chennai close in on a playoff berth this season.
Against Delhi Capitals on Wednesday, Dhoni’s nine-ball 20 helped Chennai post 167-8, setting up their 27-run victory in the low-scoring contest.
Dhoni’s average of 48 is second among the Chennai batters and his 204-plus strike rate is higher than that of any of his team-mates. 
“I have told them, ‘This is what I am supposed to do, don’t make me run a lot’ and it has been working,” Dhoni quipped after the win against Delhi. “This is what I need to do, happy to contribute with whatever deliveries I’m getting.”  
Coach Stephen Fleming said Dhoni had tailored a customised training to prepare for the role. 
“He’s really concentrated on those last three overs,” Fleming said. “He’s concentrated on really strong hitting practice and you can see the benefit of that.”  
A measure of his popularity is that teammate Ravindra Jadeja is apprehensive of batting ahead of his captain and incurring the wrath of their fans. “Even when I’m batting (at number seven), I can hear them chant his name,” the all-rounder said after the match against Delhi. “If I bat higher, they’d pray for my dismissal (so they can watch Dhoni bat).”

10,Pedersen wins stage six of Giro,NAPLES: Mads Pede­rsen of TrekSegafredo held his nerve to win stage six of the Giro d’Italia in the final sprint...,"NAPLES: Mads Pede­rsen of TrekSegafredo held his nerve to win stage six of the Giro d’Italia in the final sprint on Thursday after the peloton caught up with a breakaway duo of Simon Clarke and Alessandro De Marchi 300 metres from the finish line.
After a rain-sodden stage five that was marred by crashes, including one caused by a dog, the 162-km sixth stage in Naples was a far more pleasant ride under blue skies with the sun beating down on the riders who were glad to have dry roads.
With 25 km left, the breakaway duo of Clarke (IsraelPremier Tech) and De Marchi (JaycoAlUla) were more than two minutes ahead of the peloton, which launched its attack just in time to catch up on the final stretch.
As an exhausted Clarke and De Marchi gave way for the sprinters to take the stage, Pedersen held off Jonathan Milan, Pascal Ackermann, Kaden Groves and Fernando Gaviria to take victory.

12,"Holders Qatar to face China, Tajikistan and Lebanon at Asian Cup","DOHA: Holders and hosts Qatar will take on China, Tajikistan and Lebanon in the group stages of the Asian Cup finals...","DOHA: Holders and hosts Qatar will take on China, Tajikistan and Lebanon in the group stages of the Asian Cup finals in January after the draw was conducted in Doha on Thursday.
Qatar, who won the title for the first time when the tournament was held in the United Arab Emirates in 2019, will open their defence on Jan 12 against the Lebanese in Group ‘A’.
“The most important thing is to play good football, to have fun and bring as much pride and honour for the country,” said Qatar coach Carlos Queiroz.
“Football is always about the next step, the next game. The next game is Qatar against Lebanon in this competition and that’s what counts.
“When the games start it will be about one team, one family, one mission and one goal.”
Japan, winners of the competition on a record four occasions and who were runners-up four years ago, have been drawn in Group ‘D’ to face Indonesia, Iraq and Vietnam, currently led by former Japan coach Philippe Troussier.
Group ‘B’ will feature 2015 champions Australia alongside Uzbekistan, Syria and India while three-time winners Iran headline Group ‘C’ alongside the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong and Palestine.
South Korea will be looking to claim the title for the first time since 1960 and face Malaysia, Jordan and Bahrain in Group ‘E’ and Saudi Arabia, who won the most recent of their three titles in 1996, meet Thailand, Kyrgyzstan and Oman in Group ‘F’.
“I spoke to a lot of my players, they are all over Europe, they play in the K-League, they play in China, they play in Japan and they’re all very excited,” said South Korea coach Juergen Klinsmann.
“We have a strong team. We look at ourselves in the mirror and say we’re going to go to Qatar to win the tournament.”
The tournament, originally scheduled to be played in June and July this year, will run from Jan 12 to Feb 10 and is being held in Qatar after original hosts China stood down due to the country’s Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.
