0,Rupee hits new low near 300 vs dollar,SBP reserves fall by $74m to $4.38bn.,"KARACHI: Extending overnight losses for almost the same reasons, the rupee hit an all-time low of Rs298.93 against the US dollar in the interbank market on Thursday.
In the open market, the local currency lost Rs2 to settle at 299.
Meanwhile, the foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) declined by $74m to $4.38bn for the week ending on May 5, the central bank reported on Thursday.
The total reserves of the country were down by $53m to $9.99bn. Commercial banks’ reserves, however, recorded a paltry rise of $21m to $5.6bn during the week.

SBP reserves fall by $74m to $4.38bn

There was a consensus in the financial market that the steep devaluation of the rupee against the dollar was not solely the direct outcome of the deteriorating political situation. Instead, it was widely believed that large payments from Pakistan allowed the dollar to gain strength.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported that the dollar rose by Rs8.71 or 2.91pc on Thursday from overnight closing of Rs290.22. In the last two sessions, the greenback appreciated by Rs14.08.
However, currency dealers said the dollar depreciated to Rs292 when it was sold in tom value (tomorrow value).
Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market, said: “The market is expected to open at Rs292 or slightly above on Friday as the tom value of the dollar remained around Rs292.”
He said a large bank had been buying dollars since Wednesday which boosted the demand in the limited interbank market.
The SBP has allowed a few banks to open letters of credit for the import of goods and raw materials.
When the National Bank of Pakistan started buying dollars for large payments, the market lost the balance, pushing the dollar price to Rs298.93.
“At the time of closing on Thursday another large private bank started selling dollars which suppressed the demand and the dollar prices fell in the range of Rs290-292 for tom value,” added Mr Atif.
The rupee depreciated by 5.05pc during this month, 24.25pc in the current calendar year and 31.47pc since the start of the current fiscal year.
“The market is extremely anxious over the political developments in the country. With deteriorating sentiments, amidst plunging reserves and lack of clarity on the IMF front, there is no stopping the dollar as it surged to 299 before sharply recovering on suspected central bank intervention,” said Komal Mansoor, Head of Research at Tresmark.

2,Rs3.93 per unit tariff hike notified for KE,Hearing in Discos' plea for Rs45bn on May 24.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday notified K-Electric to charge Rs3.93 per unit additional cost to its consumers in the current month’s bill to mop up another Rs5.8bn funds as ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) sought to add another Rs44.5 billion burden to their consumers in next three months.
In a notification issued on Thursday, the regulator said it had “decided to allow (Rs5.9342 per unit) positive fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for March, to be passed on to the consumers in their monthly bills of May”. This will translate into Rs5.814bn additional revenue to KE, according to the regulatory order.
The K-Electric had sought an FCA increase of about Rs4.49 per unit to be charged to its consumers in the billing month of May under monthly fuel charges for March consumption, involving a financial gain of about Rs6.4bn KE’s accounts.
At a public hearing early last week, the regulator had announced that it worked out the FCA increase at Rs3.70 per unit to provide Rs5.47bn additional finances to KE. However, in its notification, the regulator formally allowed Rs3.934 per unit increase in FCA with a fiscal impact of Rs5.814bn.

Hearing in Discos plea for Rs45bn on May 24

The KE claimed to have produced electricity from its generation fleet at an average rate of Rs26.44 per unit compared to Rs9.50 per unit of electricity imported from the national grid. This was attributed to 14pc higher costs of LNG supplied by SSGCL and 20pc supplied by Pakistan LNG Ltd.
Separately, Nepra also called a public hearing on May 24 on the request of ex-Wapda Discos seeking permission to pass on Rs44.46bn worth of additional burden to their consumers under the quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA) mechanism for the third quarter (January-March). This is estimated to push up the average Discos’ rates by about Rs1.5 per unit for three months.
The increase was sought by the Discos on account of capacity charges, market operator fee, the impact of additional sales under incremental sales incentive scheme for the industrial sector, the use of system charges, market operator fee, transmission and distribution losses on account of fuel cost adjustment, variable operation and maintenance charges for the third quarter of the current fiscal year.

It was the lowest monthly sales in the above categories since May 2020 Covid-19 lockdown.
Higher prices, dwindling auto financing on account of high soaring interest rates, high petroleum prices, plant shutdowns due to parts shortage owing to import curbs and delay in delivery of vehicles to the customers were the main reasons for the continuous downward trend in the auto sales.
As per analysis based on the data of Pakistan Automotive Manufac­turers Association (PAMA), Toyo­ta Corolla and Yaris sales in April stood at 1,007 units, showing a fall of 10pc MoM and 76pc YoY. Sales of both these cars shrank by 64pc to 17,001 units in July-April FY23.
Toyota Fortuner and Hilux sales surged by 19pc to 941 units in April against 793 units in March. The April sales were 43pc less than the 1,658 units achieved in April. As a result, both the costly vehicle sales fell by 27pc in 10MFY23 10,539 units.

5,DTS to go live next week,Designated Time Schedule is a trading and surveillance platform meant for securities listed on the PSX.,"KARACHI: A new trading system is set to go live on the Pakistan Stock Exchange on May 15, the national bourse said on Thursday.
The planned rollout of the Designated Time Schedule (DTS), a trading and surveillance platform meant for securities listed on the PSX, follows the botched implementation of the same software back in October 2021.
Speaking to Dawn on Thursday, Pakistan Stockbrokers Association Secretary General Bilal Farooq Zardi said he’s confident that the rollout of the new system will be seamless this time around.
The representative body of stockbrokers mounted a fierce protest against the exchange’s first attempt to implement the DTS on the pretext that the system lacked even basic features at the time, which led to “frequent glitches” and reduced volume of traded shares in the country’s only stock exchange.
“The latest effort has been collaborative. Mar­ket participants and the PSX have worked toge­ther to ensure its efficiency. We’ve had many error-free mock sessions on the new system,” he said.
The PSX acquired the new system from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE), a related party, for Rs464.6 million, according to its latest financial accounts. It’s supposed to be the “safest and most advanced” system with the “utmost reliability, superior performance and low latency”.
The exchange has termed the shift to the new software the “largest project in PSX’s history” that’ll replace the two-decade-old trading system known as the Karachi Auto­mated Trading System (KATS).
The botched rollout led to “order confirmation delays” as well as problems in viewing outstanding positions. The stockbrokers complained at the time that the new system presented a “real possibility of double buying/selling”. In addition, there were issues with price summary, market summary and pre-opening bids at that time.
The spokesperson for the PSX didn’t respond to the question about the improvements that’ve been introduced in the new trading system during the last year and a half. Neither did the spokesperson confirm the number of error-free mock sessions carried out so far.

6,Digital payments halve in ‘longest’ internet shutdown,Pakistan’s largest bank HBL's spokesperson says it has seen a decline of 60pc in the throughput of POS machines.,"KARACHI: Point-of-sale (POS) transactions routed through main digital payment systems fell by around 50 per cent the day after former prime minister Imran Khan’s arrest ignited countrywide protests and prompted authorities to shut down mobile internet services, data showed on Thursday.
The reason for the slump was primarily the mobile broadband suspension, in addition to lower footfall at the limited number of stores opened due to the political turmoil, the two largest payments system operators, 1LINK and Habib Bank Ltd (HBL), told Reuters.
 
 

The violent protests that followed the PTI chief’s arrest on Tuesday by the anti-graft watchdog have hit commercial activity in the country hard.
 
 

Mobile data services have remained shut since Tuesday night on the orders of the interior ministry — the longest such continuous shutdown in a country that often suspends communications as a tool to quell unrest.
Many major roads and businesses have also remained shut, mainly in Lahore, the country’s second-largest city.
Data shared with Reuters by 1LINK on POS through its platform showed international payment card transactions were down on Wednesday by 45pc in volume, from a daily average of 127,000 during the week of May 1 to 7 to approximately 68,000 on May 10.
The daily value of transactions using international payment cards was down 46pc, from Rs606 million ($2.14m) to Rs330m on May 10.
1LINK is Pakistan’s major facilitator of POS digital payment transactions for international platforms such as Visa and Mastercard.
Transactions on Pakistan’s only domestic payment scheme, PayPak, were down 52pc in volume to 18,000 transactions on Wednesday, and 56pc down in value to roughly Rs62m.
Ali Habib, a spokesperson for HBL, Pakistan’s largest bank, said it had seen a decline of 60pc in the throughput of the POS machines.
“HBL processes over 30pc of the entire throughput of the POS machines in Pakistan. This is the largest share in the market,” he added.
The State Bank of Pakistan did not immediately respond to questions sent by Reuters.

7,Stocks rally amid positive signals on IMF deal,"KSE-100 index settles at 41,325.63 points, up 250.68 points or 0.61pc from the preceding session.","


 
KARACHI: Share prices reversed their downward trend on Thursday owing to positive signals on the macroeconomic front.
Topline Securities said the benchmark of representative shares opened on a positive note and hit an intraday high of 424 points after the Internatio­nal Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that it remained engaged with Pakistan on the restoration of the stalled Extended Fund Facility programme.
Furthermore, a decline in international coal prices also generated investors’ interest in the cement sector.
But the confidence of investors took a hit as the rupee plunged against the dollar in the later part of the trading session, said Arif Habib Ltd. It led to the stock market witnessing lacklustre activity.
As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 41,325.63 points, up 250.68 points or 0.61 per cent from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume decreased 2.4pc to 96.9 million shares. The traded value went down 15pc to $9.7m on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom Ltd (17.2m sha­res), Pakistan Internatio­nal Airlines Corporation Ltd (4.7m shares), Quice Food Industries Ltd (4.3m shares), Fauji Foods Ltd (4m shares) and Maple Leaf Cement Factory Ltd (3.8m shares).
Sectors contributing the most to the index performance were cement (54.3 points), exploration and production (49.2 points), commercial banking (41.6 points), fertiliser (31.8 poi­nts) and technology and com­munication (21.8 points).
Companies registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs69.46), Packa­ges Ltd (Rs22.83), Shield Corporation Ltd (Rs18.90), Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (Rs16.50) and Lucky Cement Ltd (Rs13.14).
Companies that recorded the biggest declines in their share prices in absolute terms were Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs100), Bata Pakistan Ltd (Rs40), JS Global Capital Ltd (Rs18.29),
