• Hopes to find political solution to turmoil
KARACHI: Describing the recent violent protests by PTI supporters after the party chief’s arrest as acts of “treason” and “terrorism” and comparing it with militant outfits, Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday turned down suggestions to ban the opposition party.
However, he warned that if Imran Khan’s party insisted on an “armed rebellion”, it would lead to the point “where we will be forced to ban such an organisation.”
Two days after Mr Khan’s arrest and several episodes of violent protests across the country, the PPP chairman chose to share his thoughts on the current crisis and, for the first time, named the real estate giant and Bahria Town founder Malik Riaz as the prime beneficiary of all the serious corruption charges being faced by Mr Khan in the Al-Qadir University Trust case.
In over an hour-long presser at Bilawal House, the foreign minister came up with a mix of ideas and proposals — he warned of a strong reaction from the state against the elements involved in violence, asked the PTI leadership to build a consensus through dialogue, called Mr Khan the “Altaf Hussain of Punjab”, and hoped to find a political solution to the ongoing turmoil.
“It won’t be my decision that there should be a ban [on PTI] or not,” he rep­lied to a question about the PTI’s future after recent attacks on state institutions and even on security installations.
“They [PTI] need to decide first whether they have really decided to now take up armed resistance in Pakistan. But if they still claim to be a political party and disown all those elements involved in the violence, then I don’t see why there should be any ban,” he said.
“But if they decide that they are going to do an armed rebellion against the state of Pakistan, then absolutely there will be circumstances where we will be forced to ban such an organisation,” he added.
Earlier, to a similar question, he called himself the last person to support a ban on any political party. He recalled the PPP’s history when it went through the same “victimisation” under dictatorial rule and was even deprived of its electoral symbol.
Due to those curbs, he said, the party was still not allowed to contest the polls under the banner of the PPP, and it went into elections under the PPP Parliamentarian.
He said the violence triggered after the PTI chairman’s arrest on Tuesday was unprecedented and reminded the dark days of Pakistan.
“As far as I remember, one attack on GHQ was carried out by the TTP and now by the PTI. As far as I remember, the outlawed BLA attacked Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s House in Balochistan, and now the second attack has been made by the PTI on Jinnah House [now designated as corps commander’s house] in Lahore,” he added.
When asked about the fate of elections amid growing political temperature and a widening gulf between the opposition and the ruling PDM alliance, Mr Bhutto-Zardari sounded quite optimistic about the possibility of the upcoming polls. He referred to the PPP’s efforts to engage all political stakeholders, including the PTI, through dialogue.
“We are in favour of holding the general elections on time and I am hopeful for finding a political solution to the current situation in the country,” the foreign minister said.
“But again, this is only possible through a political process. I invite the PTI leadership and ask them to look forward if they really want to do the politics of democratic values,” he said.

1,LHC seeks replies over internet suspension,Asks respondents to submit replies by May 22.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Thursday sought replies from the federal government and the Pakistan Tele­communi­cation Authority (PTA) on a petition challenging the suspension of internet service and access to different social media platforms in the country.
Advocate Abuzar Sal­man Niazi, the petitioner in person, contended before the court that the entire social media platforms incl­uding Facebook, Twitter and YouTube had been blocked for an indefinite period in the country. He said the internet service on the mobile phones had also been suspended by the PTA.
He argued that blocking the access to internet and social media forums was in violation of the country’s laws and fundamental rights of the citizens guaranteed by the Constitution.
He said that although no order by the PTA had been placed on record, it had been published in all newspapers that internet service had been suspended across the country.
The petitioner asked the court to take notice of the situation and enforce the fundamental rights of the citizens by directing the respondents to immediately restore the internet service across the country.
Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh issued notices to the respondents for submission of replies by May 22.
The judge also issued a notice to the attorney general for Pakistan for assistance on the inter­pretation of relevant laws and various provisions of the Constitution.

2,PTI turns agitation into jubilation after SC order,Imran to address party workers at Srinagar Highway today.,"ISLAMABAD: The PTI’s two-day-long agitation, against the arrest of its chief Imran Khan, turned into celebration on Thursday evening after the Supreme Court deemed his arrest illegal.
The apex court released Mr Khan with a directive to appear before the Islamabad High Court again on Friday (today).
Following the verdict, PTI shelved its plans to carry on with protests and its jubilant workers came out on the streets chanting slogans in favour of the PTI chairman and the Supreme Court.
However, PTI leaders claimed that law enforcement agencies fired tear gas on the party’s supporters who were celebrating the verdict.

Imran to address party workers at Srinagar Highway today

Mr Khan’s chief of staff Senator Shibli Faraz welcomed the development, saying that the verdict “blew into thin air” the propaganda that the PTI chief’s arrest was lawful.
“Two days of relentless propaganda in the media that Imran Khan’s arrest was lawful has been blown into thin air. It was not an arrest but a pure and orchestrated abduction from within the IHC premises,” he said.
Former minister Farrukh Habib requested PTI supporters to offer Nawafil (thanksgiving prayers).
“[The] Supreme Court gave a historic decision to declare Imran Khan’s detention as illegal. The entire nation should offer thanksgiving prayers,” he tweeted.
Another PTI leader, Hammad Azhar, said the verdict had “triggered a wave of happiness in the whole nation” and called upon the party’s supporters to congregate at Lahore’s Liberty roundabout for celebrations.
He also claimed there were rep­orts of tear-gassing by law enforcement agencies of PTI workers, several of whom have been arrested.
Mr Azhar urged supporters to reach the capital on Friday for the former prime minister’s appearance at the IHC.
PTI leader Usman Dar also called on the party supporters to take to the streets to express solidarity and gratitude to the top court.
Sharing a screenshot of the news of Mr Khan’s release, his ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith tweeted: “Finally sense has prevailed.”
Imran to address workers
Meanwhile, the PTI in a late-night statement appealed to its workers and supporters to gather at Srinagar Highway (G-13), Islamabad, at 10am on Friday (today) to express solidarity with their leader Imran Khan. “[PTI] Chairman Imran Khan will address the gathering after appearing before the Islamabad High Court,” it added.
Separately, President Arif Alvi met Mr Khan at a guest house located in Police Lines, where the former PM is staying as a guest of the Supreme Court.

3,President slams ransacking of public property,Also expresses anger over the way Imran was arrested from the Islamabad High Court premises.,"ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Thursday condemned the ransacking of public and private properties by miscreants during countrywide protests triggered by the arrest of PTI chief Imran Khan.
In a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the president expressed anger over the way Mr Khan was arrested on May 9 from the premises of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
“I and the people of Pakistan were shocked to see video images of the incident which reflect the manhandling of the former prime minister who is … substantially supported by the people of Pakistan.,” he said.
Dr Alvi added that the clumsy hubris in which Mr Khan’s arrest was carried out, had tarnished Pakistan’s image in the international community.
“This kind of incident should not happen with anybody and the justification that such incidents have happened before, does not make them right today,” he added.
“Of course, he [Imran] has a large number of followers who were emotionally charged after watching such scenes of his arrest and dragging of their leader by the security officials despite his injured leg due to an assassination attempt on him,” Dr Alvi wrote in the letter.
“The painful event led to attacks by mobs on public assets, including buildings of the armed forces. I believe that the people have a right to protest, but they should remain peaceful and within the bounds of the law,” the president said.
Earlier, the president condemned the damage done to public property by miscreants and appealed to the people to remain peaceful.
“The way some miscreants have damaged public property, particularly government and military buildings, is condemnable.”
The president said that the loss of human lives in the aftermath of Mr Khan’s arrest was “heart-wrenching, regrettable, unfortunate and highly condemnable”.
He said that he was “alarmed, shocked and deeply disturbed” over the current situation in the country.
“We must rethink and look for a political solution rather than coercion and arrests,” the president said.

4,Imran seeks transfer of Toshakhana case trial,"Imran seeks transfer of his trial in the Toshak­hana case from the court of ADSJ Humayun Dilawar, accusing him of being biased.","ISLAMABAD: PTI Chairman Imran Khan on Thursday filed an appeal in the Islamabad High Court seeking transfer of his trial in the Toshak­hana case from the court of Additional District and Sessions Judge Humayun Dilawar, accusing the latter of being biased.
ADSJ Dilawar was hearing a complaint filed by Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) seeking criminal proceedings against Mr Khan for concealing Toshakhana gifts.
On May 10, the judge indicted the PTI chief in the said case and also summoned all three prosecution witnesses for May 13 after Mr Khan pleaded not guilty. The judge had also dismissed Mr Khan’s application seeking transfer of his case.
The former premier raised three objections regarding the trial court.
The first objection was that since he had lost confidence in the judge, the case should be heard by any other judicial officer.
The second objection was related to a pending revision petition. Mr Khan was of the view that the trial court could not proceed in this matter until a decision on revision petition.
The third objection was the change of venue of the court from the District Courts to Police Guest House at H-11.
The trial court judge observed that there was no restraining order on the revision petition. He said that showing no confidence in court is part of tactics to delay the trial proceeding.
Regarding the shifting of the court’s venue, the judge observed that the order of the chief commissioner to designate the Police Guest House as a sub-jail was not challenged at the appropriate forum.
Mr Khan challenged the decision of the trial court in the IHC. The petition stated that the trial court judge “harboured bias against the petitioner and was, therefore, predisposed to dismiss the applications filed by the petitioner”.
Accountability court order
In the meanwhile, the accountability court order also became public on Thursday.
The order, which has become infructuous after the Supreme Court decl­ared the arrest of Imran Khan illegal and rema­nded his case to the IHC, set terms and conditions for Mr Khan’s eight-day physical remand.
The court granted permission for Mr Khan’s personal physician to join the medical team responsible for assessing his health condition and conducting check-ups.

5,COMMENT: Experts disapprove of manner in which Imran picked up,KARACHI: Legal eagles while analysing the Supreme Court’s order vis-à-vis PTI chief Imran Khan’s arrest in a...,"KARACHI: Legal eagles while analysing the Supreme Court’s order vis-à-vis PTI chief Imran Khan’s arrest in a National Ac­­co­unt­abi­lity Bureau (NAB) case have agreed that the manner in which the former prime minister was taken into custody was not appropriate, Dawn.com reported.
The apex court ordered immediate release of Mr Khan, terming his arrest unlawful, while also directing the former prime minister to appear before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday (today).
In his comment, lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii said, “The arrest was high-handed, the optics were horrible and the reasoning with which the IHC declared it legal was weak.”
“This was a necessary intervention, and it was good to see Justice [Athar] Minallah on the bench which called a spade a spade.”
He added that the inquiry into the Al Qadir Trust case, in which Imran Khan was arrested, could not proceed without taking on property tycoon Malik Riaz as the principal accused.
“Fifty million of the pounds Malik Riaz connived with Shehzad Akbar to pay back to himself were related to 1 Hyde Park Place, which Malik Riaz bought from Hassan Nawaz,” he said.
“If this was about the law, everyone in that chain of events would have been questioned.
“The fact that the buck begins and stops with Imran Khan shows that this case was always as much about politics as back when Imran Khan and Gen Faiz Hameed would harass Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, and leave them in the hands of the world’s most incompetent hatchet job that is the NAB.”
“The NAB’s incompetence now stretches itself to the last three serving prime ministers,” said Mr Jaferii, adding that “letting off the incumbent prime minister for the money laundering charges against him are further evidence of their incompetence”.
‘Hardly surprising’
“The Supreme Court has previously, in cases including that of Ali Moosa Gilani, declared a person’s arrest from the court’s premises to be illegal,” recalled lawyer Mirza Moiz Baig.
“In Gilani’s case, the court deprecated the accused’s arrest after he had been arrested from the court’s entrance while approaching it to seek pre-arrest bail.
This view is consistent with the principle that a person cannot be penalised for surrendering himself to the law.
“While the NAB chairman may have some grounds to issue a warrant of arrest, arresting Imran Khan from the court’s premises is inconsistent with the precedents laid down by the Supreme Court,” said Mr Baig, adding that while the Islamabad High Court’s decision acknowledged that the arrest from court premises was improper, its view that the arrest was nonetheless legal departed from the law laid down by the Supreme Court and set a dangerous precedent.
“The Supreme Court’s decision to declare the arrest unlawful is hardly surprising.”
‘Unprecedented relief’
However, lawyer Usama Khawar was of the opinion that the SC order for Mr Khan’s immediate release in the Al Qadir Trust case “is unprecedented, not only in the history of the NAB Ordinance but also our entire criminal law jurisprudence, especially, the jurisprudence governing the granting of bail in Pakistan”.
According to Mr Khawar, “there does not exist a single precedent in our history where an accused, arrested in a non-bailable offence and whose bail has been rejected by a high court, has ever been released by the Supreme Court within two days of his arrest.”
“This is the fastest case of getting post-arrest bail from the Supreme Court in our entire legal history. (It is another matter that the law of bail in Pakistan is archaic, draconian and in immediate need for reform, but it is applicable to everyone.)”
Mr Khawar said there may, however, be good reason for declaring Mr Khan’s arrest illegal, for example, denial of access to justice and the manner of his arrest.
“If the decision is looked at without any political context — who the accused is, what sort of allegations have been levelled against him and the judiciary in recent past — it appears to be a progressive decision, but the context is very important here.
“There have been allegations of special treatment for Imran Khan by the courts and our judicial system, especially by the Supreme Court, during the last six years. This perception undermines the rule of law, impartiality of the Supreme Court and equality before the law,” he added.
‘Courageous decision’
Lawyer Rida Hosain termed the decision a “correct and courageous one”.
“There have been cases in the past where such arrests on court premises have been declared unlawful. The decision sends a strong message to state institutions who often operate with total impunity.
“The message is clear and should have been obvious — you do not get to ransack the court, manhandle court staff and lawyers, and assemble a paramilitary force to arrest an individual who has come to the court.
Ms Hosain added that “anyone who saw the manner in which the arrest was carried out could have safely said it had nothing to do with the law”.
“It was a power show which the court has rightly called illegal. It is times such as these that show why it is vital to stand with an independent judiciary.”
Courts are sanctuaries
“The Supreme Court spoke of the sanctity of our court premises, which are meant to be sanctuaries,” said Barrister Asad Rahim. “In any functioning state, citizens are afforded the liberty to surrender themselves to the law — not be clobbered into submission through batons and broken glass.”
“This is also in line with clear-cut precedent that forbids our citizens being arrested from the court, as well as the amended NAB law that has made the organisation’s powers to arrest less arbitrary.
“Deciding to keep Imran within Police Lines, however, is more of a transitional order than an affirmative declaration. The court has stopped well short of reversing what happened on May 9.”
‘Balancing act’
For lawyer Basil Nabi Malik, “the arrest itself did appear mala fide, and arresting people from court is certainly an ‘access to justice’ issue, to which extent, the SC’s observations appear to hold muster”.
“However, holding the arrest to be invalid and yet not unequivocally releasing him is a quaint reflection of our SC’s decision-making process as it stands today — the law figures in its determinations, but isn’t perhaps the sole or most important factor in rendering a decision.”
“Exigencies of circumstances, and a balancing act, seem to loom large in coming to a conclusion,” he added.

6,PDM huddle called today to discuss future course of action,Fazl summons meeting after Imran’s release.,"ISLAMABAD: The heads of all parties in the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) will meet today (Friday) to chalk out a course of action in the wake of the Supreme Court’s order to release PTI Chairman Imran Khan.
The meeting has been called by Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who also heads the PDM coalition.
In a late-night news conference after a meeting of JUI-F’s top leaders on Thursday, Maulana Fazl assailed the Supreme Court order, claiming that the PTI chief had been constantly provided relief by the judiciary.
He criticised the Supreme Court and said that soon after riots and unrest were started by PTI workers, it was clear to the government that it was only a matter of two days before the courts intervene.

Fazl summons meeting after Imran’s release

“I had said that it will be for two days only and after that, the Supreme Court will come to his [Mr Khan’s] rescue and that happened,” he said.
“Has any person detained by NAB been given such a VIP treatment and protocol for the court appearance?” he asked.
“We have held anti-government protests, organised million marches and gathered in Islamabad too, but did not resort to violence or damaged state properties,” he claimed, adding that the PTI’s response was immature and yet Mr Khan was given relief by the Supreme Court.
He reiterated that negotiations can’t be held with Mr Khan as he has nothing to offer.

According to officials, the security forces received information about the presence of Saddam alias Langra at a hotel in the tribal district and cordoned off the area, adding that an exchange of fire took place between the security personnel and the alleged militant.
The officials said that following an intense exchange of fire, Langra, a mastermind of several suicide bombings and a member of the TTP Khadri group, was gunned down.
“Langra was also involved in several attacks, including a targeted attack on security forces in the Haiderkhel area a few days ago,” an official said.
No statement was issued by Inter-Services Public Relations, the military’s media wing, about the operation and killing of the TTP commander till late into the night.

8,"Value of ocean economy ranges $3-6tr per year, says UN","Marine resources under threat from climate change, pollution and overfishing","ISLAMABAD: The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has said the value of the ocean economy ranges between $3 trillion and $6tr per year, sustaining at least 150 million direct jobs across a wide range of sectors, including but not limited to fishing, aquaculture, shipping, tourism, offshore wind energy, oil and gas, mining and marine biotechnology.
UNCTAD, in its latest Trade and Environment Review 2023 released this week, said marine resources are under threat from climate change, pollution and overfishing.
About 11m tonnes of plastic flow into the oceans each year. Globally, 34 per cent of fish stocks have fallen to levels that are biologically unsustainable.
At stake are the livelihoods of about three billion people — living mostly in coastal areas of developing countries. The export value of ocean-based goods — including fisheries, seafood, ships and port equipment — and services — such as shipping and coastal tourism — was estimated at $1.3tr in 2020.

Marine resources under threat from climate change, pollution and overfishing

The European Union is by far the world’s leading exporter with $459bn worth of exports, followed by China ($160bn). Among developing coun­tries, the next biggest exporters are India ($34bn), Turkiye ($19bn) and Thailand ($17bn).
The Covid-19 crisis revealed the potential and resilience of some sectors and the extreme vulnera­bility of others. In general, exports of ocean-based goods showed remarkable resilience during the crisis, falling by just 3.2pc in value in 2020.
This was minimal compared to the 59pc crash suffered by ocean-related services, mainly driven by the collapse in coastal and marine tourism, which suffered the most from lockdowns.
Two ocean-based goods sectors — seafood proces­sing and marine high-technology manufac­tures — even grew during the peak of the pandemic, as more people reached for ready-to-eat foods with a longer shelf-life and electronic monitoring devices.
As a result, the export of ocean-based goods ($681bn) overtook those of services ($628bn) in 2020.
The drop in revenue from services hit many coastal communities in developing countries, which often rely on sectors like tourism.
Diversifying ocean exports and activities is key to building economic resilience to future crises.
The report highlighted two emerging sustainable sectors — seaweed and plastics substitutes — that offer huge opportunities for developing countries to attract investment, create jobs and diversify their ocean economies.
Seaweed can grow without fresh water or fertiliser and captures huge amounts of CO2.
The global market has more than tripled in two decades, growing from $4.5bn in 2000 to $16.5bn in 2020.
It can be farmed for food, cosmetics and biofuels, and can be used as an alternative to plastic.
The global exports of plastics reached about 369m tonnes in 2021. Most of it will end up flooding our oceans.
But nature abounds in sustainable materials that could be used to make eco-friendly vers­ions of the plastic prod­ucts we consume daily.
Besides algae, the list includes bamboo, banana plants and agricultural wastes.
The world traded about $388bn in plastics subst­itutes in 2020.
While this is already a sizeable market, it is just one third the amount traded in plastics made from fossil fuels.
So there is huge potential for growth. Two thirds of global exports of plastic substitutes are in the form of raw materials that many developing countries have in abundance.
The report points out that an estimated $35bn of government subsidies go to fishing activities around the world.
The impact of this money on fish stocks and ocean sustainability depends on how it is used.
While some funds, for example, support susta­inable fisheries manag­ement and artisanal fishers, a significant share — about $20bn a year — could contribute to overfishing by enhancing the capacity of the fishing industry.
Such support includes providing fuel subsidies, paying operational costs or providing financial support to buy larger ships.
Estimates show an investment of $2.8tr today in four sustainable solutions — conservation and restoration of mangroves, decarbonisa­tion of international ship­p­ing, sustainable ocean-based food production and offshore wind energy — would yield benefits of $15.5tr by 2050.
