The PTI leaders have been detained for one month, sources added.
On the other hand, the detained PTI supporters and activists were produced before being shifted to jail. Islamabad police had said: “Arrests had been made for inciting arson and violent protests under a thought-out plan for threatening peace.”
In Rawalpindi, the police have arrested around 200 activists of PTI so far and 13 cases have been registered against them with various criminal charges and section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATC).
GB CM under house arrest
In a surprise move, the police also put the GB CM under house arrest at the GB House – after declaring it a sub-jail – in Islamabad along with 30 others, including politicians and his personal staff. The office of the Criminal Intelligence Agency was also declared a sub-jail for PTI leaders.
The police officials revealed that raids were being conducted to arrest more PTI leaders and added that a majority of leaders had gone into hiding to avoid arrest.
Though things were relatively calm on Thursday, Islamabad witnessed two major demonstrations by PTI supporters who converged on Express Chowk and Police Lines Chowk at Srinagar Highway. They also attempted to move towards Constitution Avenue, but the police intercepted them and dispersed them by using teargas and batons. There were numerous clashes between the police and protesters, but none of them were decisive.
Meanwhile, nine more cases were registered against over 1,800 PTI members at Kohsar, Tarnol, Karachi Company, Koral, Sihala and Industrial Area police stations, the police said.

Roads remain blocked
After the Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered PTI Chairman Imran Khan’s arrest “unlawful”, the police in the garrison city were alerted and patrolling by Quick Response Force (QRF) was increased around sensitive government buildings in the cantonment area.
Earlier, the district administration had eased the traffic on Peshawar Road which was blocked with containers after violent protesters stormed the army headquarters protesting the arrest of Imran Khan.
The blockade of roads leading to Saddar was relaxed on Thursday, but after the SC order, the roads leading to General Headquarters (GHQ) were blocked again with containers and trucks.
The City Traffic Police said in a statement that all roads including Murree Road were clear for traffic. However, the roads located around sensitive establishments were closed. People were advised to keep a margin of 15 to 20 minutes before starting their travel to avoid any inconvenience.
According to eyewitnesses, two persons were injured after they clashed with each other on the release order the of PTI chairman. One was a supporter of PML-N and the other was a PTI activist. They kicked and punched each other which left them injured, however, the situation was brought under control by the intervention of onlookers. Although no violent incident was reported in the city on Thursday, business activities remained dull and the traffic on the roads was also thin.
Metro service suspended
After initial damage to Metro Bus Service bus stations of Rs40 million, Punjab Masstransit Authority on Thursday asked Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) and NESPAK to examine the intensity of damage to structure and pillars of the elevated road and bus stations and inform estimates as soon as possible.
After the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in the Al Qadir Trust case, the PTI workers staged a protest and set fire to the 6th Road metro station and destroyed Faizabad and Shamsabad bus stations.
Talking to Dawn, Syed Ozair Shah, general manager of the authority, said that a letter had been written to NESPAK – Metro Bus project consultant – and Rawalpindi Development Authority to form a committee of experts and engineers to assess the damage to the metro infrastructure.
“In the initial survey, PMA found that the elevator, escalator, cables and ticket stations and bus station at 6th Road were damaged severely and as per the initial estimate, we lost Rs40 million. However, we fear that the fire damaged the pillars and structure of the elevated road,” he said.
He said that the operation of bus service between Rawalpindi and Islamabad will remain suspended on Friday. “The deputy commissioners of Rawalpindi and Islamabad will give the go-ahead after security clearance but on Friday, Imran Khan will be produced in Islamabad High Court and on this occasion, the bus service will remain suspended,” he said.
On the other hand, the officials said that the bus service suffered a Rs9 million loss due to its suspension, as approximately Rs3 million is earned on a daily basis. — Aamir Yasin in Rawalpindi also contributed to this report

On Thursday, in compliance with the order, the Malir Jail commenced the arrangements for the release and shifting of the prisoners. 
Member of the National Commission of Human Rights Sindh, Anis Haroon was present atthe jail to oversee the arrangements.
It was a moment of joy and relief for the Indian fishermen who had been incarcerated for years simply for accidentally crossing the maritime border. NCHR said that the decision to release the fishermen was a goodwill gesture by the government of Pakistan, especially since it also planned to release a second batch of 200 Indians in June and the last batch of 100 prisoners in July.
In a press statement, Chairperson NCHR Rabiya Javeri Agha welcomed the decision and had appreciated the Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Secretary Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their effort on this crucial human rights issue.
“This is a moment of relief and joy for the prisoners and their families. We thank the government of Pakistan, the LAS, Haya Zahid and the fishermen forums for all their support in this deeply heart wrenching issue. We hope that the Indian government will reciprocate and that the mechanism for mutual release of fishermen is streamlined and made efficacious” said Chairperson NCHR Rabiya Javeri Agha. 
The NCHR data showed that more than 650 Indian fishermen were currently in Pakistani jails and another 100+ Pakistani fishermen are in Indian jails.
NCHR’s campaign was launched on May 1, and highlighted the ordeal of prisoners held in jails in India and Pakistani for accidentally crossing the maritime borders. 
The campaign also emphasized on the implementation of national and international agreements applied on such prisoners, besides urging the governments of Pakistan and India to schedule talks to ensure the return of the detained fishermen and find out a permanent solution to the issue.
Data collected by the commission showed that there were an estimated 1,155 foreign prisoners in Pakistan, with a significant proportion being foreign fishermen. 
NCHR’s campaign began with visits to Malir Prison, Karachi and meetings with stakeholders including Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs.
The Commission had also developed a policy brief covering the background and details around the issues and recommending urgent policy and procedural measures to ensure repatriation of foreign fishermen to their country of origin on humanitarian grounds and for easing the strain on prison resources. 
The policy paper urges a long-term solution to the issue and urged the Pakistani government to appoint members for its vacant seats in the Joint Judicial Commission with India. The commission also wrote to the NHRC Chairperson of India to help facilitate the return of Pakistanis fisherman from Indian jails.

8,Construction of two more parking plazas planned in capital,CDA to call tenders for award of work during next three days,"ISLAMABAD: Besides an under-construction parking plaza which is being built with revised deadline, the city managers have decided to start construction of two more similar plazas. The Capital Development Authority (CDA) in the next three days is going to call tenders for awarding work to start two new parking plazas.
According to a document of the CDA, work on Blue Area parking plaza worth Rs1.3 billion is in progress. It will have a basement plus ground and six storeys and will have the capacity of parking 900 cars and 150 motorcycles. The plaza is being built near Savour Foods. 
This project was started in March last year and it was supposed to be completed in March this year, but it could not be completed in one year’s time and now under the revised deadline, this project is supposed to be completed on Sept 30 this year.

CDA to call tenders for award of work during next three days

An official of CDA said that the said plaza faced delay in completion and missed the deadline because of crossing of a big nullah from the project site. “Actually, because of the nullah and slush, we missed the initial deadline, however, now, the project is in full swing and will be completed by Sept 30,” said an official.
Meanwhile, director works Tahir Mahmood said that CDA had decided to start construction of two more plazas immediately. “We are going to call tenders in the next three days to award contract of two plazas - one each in I-8 markaz and one in F-8,” he said.
He added that design of four more plazas is also completed and soon the authority will decide when they will be started. “But, it is confirmed that we are going to start I-8 and F-8 parking plazas soon as tender will be called in three days,” the director said.
It is relevant to note here that parking is one of the major issues, the city has been facing. The available parking space is shrinking and causing problems for motorists.
In the past, the CDA instead of constructing multi-storey parking plazas had built two underground parking spaces in Jinnah Super Market. But those parking lots could not be utilised properly even though millions of rupees were spent on their construction.
CDA officials Dawn spoke pointed out that besides massive increase in the number of vehicles during the last two decades and so, poor implementation of bylaws and ill planning were contributing factors behind this issue.
They said that parking spaces had been designed in markets and plazas in accordance with a number of shops but with the passages of time shop owners, alerted the layout plan, increasing the number of shops.
While, in commercial buildings in marakaz, adequate parking space should have been made in basements. Whereas, the number of shops has also been increased in all class three shopping centres (neighbourhood markets).
Earlier, in 2016, the Islamabad Traffic Police had written to the CDA regarding the shortage of parking spaces in Blue Area and other commercial centres, including F-8 Markaz.
