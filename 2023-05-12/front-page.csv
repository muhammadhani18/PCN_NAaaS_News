• Court ‘requests’ PTI chief to condemn violence
• Former prime minister to appear before IHC today, reiterates call for elections
ISLAMABAD: The Sup­reme Court on Thursday extended ‘extraordinary’ relief to PTI chief Imran Khan as a three-member bench termed his arrest on the premises of the Islamabad High Court “invalid and unlawful”.
The court directed that NAB and police would ensure “foolproof” security to Mr Khan until his production before the high court in connection with his petition against NAB in the Al Qadir Trust case.
The bench, headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, made it clear to Imran Khan, who was produced on the apex court’s directions, that this was an extraordinary relief, never extended to other political leaders though they also suffered ordeal worse than this.
The court added it took up the case since the right to access to justice was denied and the sanctity and safety of the court were violated. The court observed that the arrest was illegal and said the entire process needed to be backtracked since a citizen enjoyed certain guarantees, particularly access to justice, on the court premises.
The CJP asked Imran Khan that being a senior leader he should consider opening up a dialogue channel with his political opponents “whom he may not like but they are a reality” as this would restore confidence among people.
A heavy contingent of the police, as well as the Rangers, was deployed outside the court on Constitution Avenue at the time of the hearing. In a blue dress and a dark blue waistcoat, Mr Khan entered Courtroom No. 1 two days after his arrest under a tight security cordon. At the outset when the ex-PM came to the rostrum, he was greeted by the CJP who welcomed him saying “Good to see you”.
Mr Khan informed the court that he had no idea what happened after his arrest, though he stated he believed whatever happened should not have happened.
‘Invalid and unlawful’
Later in a three-page order, the detailed reasons of which will come later, the apex court said the manner of execution of the arrest warrant issued by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman in the Al Qadir Trust case on the IHC premises against Imran Khan was invalid and unlawful.

“The execution of the warrant violated Khan’s right of access to justice and the sanctity and safety of the court as he had already surrendered to the court for seeking judicial relief against the action taken by NAB in the Al Qadir Trust case.”
In this regard, the fundamental rights of the petitioner under Articles 4, 9, 10-A and 14 of the constitution have been infringed, the order said, adding the petitioner was directed to be produced before IHC on May 12 at 11am for hearing of his case filed to challenge the NAB action in the Al Qadir Trust case.
The NAB authorities and the police will ensure foolproof security to the petitioner until his production in the high court, the order said, adding the IHC registrar will place the matter before the IHC CJ for constituting a bench for hearing the case.
The court said the PTI chairman would remain at Police Lines Headquarters under the protection of the police.
It also allowed him to meet 10 guests, whose particulars will be provided by Imran Khan to the police officer concerned and subject to security check. The order will remain valid until the production of the petitioner before IHC. The apex court also made it clear that this order would not prejudice the NAB investigation in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
‘Abduction’
Mr Khan described his arrest as “abduction” stating that the shocking event was executed in a “commando style as if he was a terrorist”.
According to the ex-premier, he had no idea what had happened after his arrest since no one communicated with him. He said he met his lawyers on Wednesday who told him about the chaos. The PTI chairman said the arrest warrant was shown to him after the arrest.
 
 

“We don’t want anarchy in the country since we are a [political] party which believes in the Constitution; [we] want immediate elections,” Mr Khan said, also reminding that he called off earlier protests all the time whenever he heard about disturbances.
After the hearing, Imran Khan took a moment inside the courtroom on a sofa to meet lawyers and those who encircled him. The court declined his request to allow him to stay at his Banigala residence or to order his appearance before the high court after a few days.
Request to condemn violence
Explaining the reason behind his production order, the CJP observed that it was the “request and desire” of the court that he should condemn violence taken place after his arrest.
“We need to restore peace and calm in the country to let the constitutional machinery function smoothly,” the CJP observed, adding that being a political leader and the former prime minister, he has huge responsibility upon his shoulders to placate the charged political atmosphere.
Justice Minallah said Pakistan needed “a statesman who should rise above hate and political differences” to unite the nation for its stability. He regretted the release of a video clip soon after his arrest, inciting political workers to undermine the rule of law.
“We feel you were denied justice but more needs to be done,” Justice Minallah observed and added that Imran Khan should understand that “this was an extraordinary relief being extended to him”.
Justice Minallah also cautioned that the law will take its own course against those who had caused huge damage to the image of the country. Leaders always lead and not be led,“ Justice Minallah said, adding it was his responsibility as well that he should have some introspection.
 
 

Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar reminded Khan that whatever he will say would be communicated to his supporters and workers due to the heavy presence of the representatives of the media and social media and recalled how a contempt case was also pending before the court due to non-adherence to court direction to hold the May 25, 2022 protest in the ground near G-9/H-9 ground.
When Justice Mazhar stressed that Imran Khan should have responded to the call-up notice of NAB, Mr Khan said his Khawaja Haris has answered the bureau about everything but hastened to add that Mr Khan will still join the inquiry.
During the hearing, Justice Bandial recalled he received a threatening message from a journalist stating that ‘just wait until his own house will be set on fire’. “This is being done because we do justice,” the CJP regretted.

1,Govt berates judiciary over ‘dual standard’,"Khawaja Asif says option of emergency cannot be ruled out; PM calls ""emergency"" meeting of cabinet today.","• Khawaja Asif says option of emergency cannot be ruled out
• Maryam says chief justice should join PTI
• PM calls ‘emergency’ meeting of cabinet today
ISLAMABAD: Leaders of the ruling coalition on Thursday came out with a strong reaction over the decision of the three-judge Supreme Court bench regarding ‘release’ of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan and termed it “a part of judiciary’s dual standard”.
The leaders including key ministers, in their statements and news conferences, lambasted the judiciary and specifically targeted the chief justice of Pakistan.
The reaction was expected as the ruling coalition had already been criticising the judiciary for the past couple of months for allegedly facilitating the PTI on the issue of the elections in Punjab and they had already passed at least four strongly-worded resolutions against the SC.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif went on to say that due to the prevailing situation, the option of enforcing an emergency could not be ruled out. “The federal cabinet can decide about the enforcement of emergency in the country,” the minister said in a press conference on Thursday.
The defence minister said the judiciary has set a dual standard for the PTI and the rest, claiming that Imran Khan was facilitated by the court in an unprecedented manner. “On the other hand, leaders of the ruling coalition had been sent on remand for more than six months for committing no offence,” he added.
“Today the Supreme Court has ensured whether Imran Khan was given proper facilities during detention. But for others, the apex court has not shown such emotions,” the minister said. Mr Asif said the Supreme Court should also have taken suo motu notice of countrywide riots and ransacking of public and private properties by unruly mobs reportedly affiliated with the PTI since the arrest of Imran Khan.
“The Supreme Court has not taken notice of the ransacking of monuments of martyrs but sent a person respectfully to a rest house. Why such treatment had not been given to other political leaders, like Asif Ali Zardari, Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz and others,” he asked.
He said they were not allowed during imprisonment to have food from home while Imran Khan had been given a facility to meet 10 people during custody. “Why this dual standard has been set,” he questioned.
“We were sent behind bars for 90 days or more than that but the way the court showed affection to Mr Khan, we don’t know how (the court) spent two nights (since the arrest of Imran) and why such facilitating decision had not been given within 15 minutes of his arrest,” the defence minister quipped.
He claimed that countrywide violent protest was staged by the PTI supporters under a pre-planned move. “Even before his arrest Imran Khan had already instigated PTI workers to spread in the country for the protest in case he is arrested,” he added.
PML-N Chief Organiser Maryam Nawaz showed her frustration over the apex court’s order by taking a swipe at the CJP in connection with the ‘chaotic situation’ in the country.
“The CJP was happy to meet Imran Khan who is accused of embezzling Rs60bn. He also felt happy by ordering the release of this suspect,” said Ms Nawaz in a tweet. She accused the CJP of shielding this ‘fitna’. She said it would be better for the CJP to “leave his office and join the PTI”.
In a press conference, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb questioned the “soft corner of the apex court” for Imran Khan. “When Nawaz Sharif and his family were held accountable, then why couldn’t Imran? What is this love affair and favouritism?” she questioned.
She said the Islamabad High Court had said that the arrest was carried out in a legal manner. “But the impression of the Supreme Court giving relief to a criminal, terrorist, and a gangster leading armed groups — it amounts to backing a terrorist,” she claimed.
PM’s aide Atta Tarar, in a press conference, termed the SC’s decision as the “worst decision in the history of the country”. “Today the Supreme Court has legalised corruption in the country,” he alleged.
Responding to a question about the possibility of a dialogue between the government and the PTI, the PML-N leader said: “After today’s decision, talks cannot be held. Why should we obey the Supreme Court’s order to sit with PTI for talks,” he added. About the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan, the PM’s aide said: “Today Malik Riaz (a real estate tycoon) won and justice defeated.”
PM meets Fazl
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a meeting with the chief of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), Maulana Fazlur Rehman, and held a detailed discussion on the current political situation in the country.
During the meeting, they strongly condemned the attacks of workers of PTI on state institutions and damage to government properties. The two leaders consulted on the recent decision of the Supreme Court and discussed the future strategy, said an official press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).

2,Two more audio leaks surface,PTI's Hammad Azhar confirmed the authenticity of the leaked conversation between Imran and Musarrat Cheema.,"ISLAMABAD: The audio leaks continue to spill the beans as the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf steps up its legal battle to rescue Imran Khan in various cases.
Following the Supreme Court’s hearing on the PTI chief’s arrest in the Al Qadir Trust case, two lea­ked audio calls have been released to social media and aired by the mainstream electronic media.
A leaked call apparently recorded on Tuesday (May 9), after the arrest of Mr Khan, purportedly records him as talking to Musarrat Jamshed Chee­ma, a PTI leader, and asking her about “the situation” in the courtroom of the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) chief justice after his arrest.
Mr Khan apparently told Musarrat Cheema to ask party leader Azam Swati to take up the matter with the Supreme Court.
The PTI chief criticises the chief justice for taking orders from ‘them’.
PTI leader Hammad Azhar confirmed the authenticity of the leaked conversation. He said Mr Khan was referring to the chief justice of the Islamabad High Court.
He, however, said the “real issue” is the supremacy of the Constitution.
In another leaked audio call between the head of PTI’s legal team, Khawaja Tariq Rahim, and journalist Abdul Qayyum Siddiqui, the former purportedly told the latter that the Supreme Court would send the case to the IHC for Friday.
He said the IHC Chief Justice would recuse himself from hearing the case as the PTI lawyer would raise objections against him.
The case would then be marked to Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and he would grant bail to Mr Khan, Tariq Rahim apparently told Qayyum Siddiqui.

3,Budget to be presented on June 9: Dar,"“Pakis­tan will not default whether there is an IMF programme or no programme,” finance minister insists.","ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday announced that the federal budget for fiscal 2024 would be presented on June 9 and insis­ted that Pakistan would not default on any foreign liability, with or without an IMF programme.
Speaking to journalists after a seminar organised by the National Security Division, the minister said there should be no concern over the repayment of $3.7 billion foreign loans during May and June and a payment plan had been firmed up.
He said Pakistan had fulfilled all the prior actions of the International Monetary Fund and it was now up to the lender to sign the agreement, and further tough decisions could not be taken at this stage. He hoped that China would roll over another $2.4bn loan.
Responding to a question, he said the federal budget would be presented in the parliament on June 9.
Mr Dar said the delay in the IMF deal should not be linked to default. “Pakis­tan will not default whether there is an IMF programme or no programme,” he asserted. He said the staff-level agreement with the Fund should have been reached much earlier as talks had been concluded on Feb 9 and all prior actions were met soon after that, even though the government had taken all the tough decisions despite a heavy political cost.
He explained that some bilateral partners had committed financial assistance at the time of last review with the IMF in August last year and the lender was now waiting for those commitments to be materialised before signing the agreement.
He said those bilateral friends had given their assurances to the IMF again, but the Fund wanted this to be actually disbursed.
Mr Dar complained that suspicions were being created as if Pakistan was going to default on international payments. He said an international rating agency talked about Pakistan’s $3.7bn external payments due before June 30 and when he responded to the situation with a clarification, another rating agency came up with an assertion the next day that Pakistan would not be able to meet its foreign obligations from July to December.
Pakistan should not be subjected to unfair international politics, and rumour-mongering should be avoided, he said.
He said the country’s current account had turned into a surplus in March and would go up further in April as well when data is finalised.

4,Govt tells IMF it will scrap fuel subsidy plan,Lender insists Pakistan needs significantly more financing for successful bailout review.,"• Lender to remain engaged with govt on loan despite political tensions
• Insists Pakistan needs significantly more financing for successful bailout review
THE government has told the International Monetary Fund (IMF) it would not implement a fuel subsidy programme as the two sides negotiate a long-delayed $1.1 billion bailout for the country, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.
The IMF has also said that it would “continue engagement with the government on the loan despite the ramp-up in political tensions”. The remarks came after the arrest of PTI chief Imran Khan on Tuesday sparked violent protests across the country.
As for fuel subsidy, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in March proposed charging affluent consumers more for fuel, with the money raised used to subsidise prices for the poor who have been hit hard by inflation.
However, the government has now committed not to implement the cross-subsidy programme in the current fiscal year and beyond, an IMF spokesperson reportedly told Bloomberg.
The government also would not introduce new tax exemptions and would durably allow a market-based exchange rate for the rupee currency, the lender said.
The development came a day after Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik said the government aimed to add­ress IMF’s concerns before impl­ementing its new fuel subsidy plan.
‘Significantly more financing’
Meanwhile, in a scheduled press conference on Thursday, the IMF said Pakistan needed significant additional financing to successfully complete the long-stalled ninth review of the IMF’s bailout package, Reuters reported.
Obtaining commitments of “significant additional financing” is essential before the IMF approves the release of pending bailout funds that are crucial for Pakistan to resolve an acute balance of payments crisis.
A staff-level accord to release the $1.1bn tranche out of a $6.5bn IMF package has been delayed since November, with nearly 100 days gone since the last staff-level mission to Pakistan. That is the longest such gap since at least 2008.
Julie Kozack, IMF spokeswoman, said that financing already committed by Pakistan’s external partners was welcomed.
The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and China came to Pakistan’s assistance in March and April with pledges that would cover some of the funding deficit.
On Thursday, reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan fell $74m to $4.38bn, barely a month’s worth of imports.
“Our team is very heavily engaged of course with the Pakistani authorities, because Pakistan indeed faces a very challenging situation,” Ms Kozack said.
She said the economy was facing stagflation, had very large financing needs and had also been affected by a series of shocks, including severe floods.
