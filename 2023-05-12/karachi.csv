0,NAB given last chance to file reference in M6 motorway land scam,HYDERABAD: Accountability Court Judge-I Mehboob Ali Dayo on Thursday gave final chance to the National ...,"HYDERABAD: Accountability Court Judge-I Mehboob Ali Dayo on Thursday gave final chance to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to file reference in the mega corruption of land acquisition for M6 Sukkur-Hyderabad motorway in Matiari and fixed May 25 for hearing of the case. 
The NAB sought time to file the final reference in the matter under Section 16-E of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999.
A NAB’s investigating officer (IO) also filed a progress report which was taken on record by the court. He filed an application before the court under Section 344 of CrPC for grant of further time to complete the investigation. 
The IO informed the court that a plea bargain application of Ashiq Hussain Kaleri for return of Rs1,244.988m was in principle accepted in the Regional Board Meeting (RBM) on May 9 subject to fulfillment of codal formalities and surrender of properties by the accused, his family members and benamidars.
It said the RBM recommended that the interim challan filed by the ACE before the special judge anticorruption Sukkur and interim challan filed by special judge (offences in banks) Karachi might be transferred to that court under Section 160-A (a) of NA 1999 respectively with approval of the NAB Headquarters.
It informed the court that the record had been seized from Bank Al Habib Bahria Town branch Karachi, National Bank of Pakistan and Sindh Bank Nawabshah branches and Bank Al Habib Sharea Fiasal branch Karachi. 
It said the investigation was at the final stage and record was awaited from the State Bank of Pakistan, forensic report was awaited from Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, mobile phones, forensic report of the accused was awaited from the FIA forensic laboratory, Islamabad, and statements of few witnesses were yet to be recorded.
It said general bank account search and general properties search of all the accused, their family members and benamidars were initiated through the State Bank of Pakistan and revenue authorities, respectively. The record was being received and seized. 
The NAB said Rs2.37bn were illegally withdrawn from the account of Land Acquisition Officer (LAO), Matiari, without passing of award under Section 11 of Land Acquisition Act 1894. 
Out of Rs2.37bn, Rs553m were given to landowners through cash cheques and time was required for the recovery of Rs553m illegally given to the landowners in the absence of any award u/s 11 of LAA 1894. 
While Adnan Rasheed, Mansoor Abbasi, Tabish Shah, Zawar Shah, Tharo Khan, Mir Mohammad Suhag and Ashiq Hussain Kaleri were arrested, efforts were under way to arrest the remaining accused and recover looted money; therefore, further time might be granted to complete the investigation to file final reference before the court, IO said. 
Ishrat Lohar, counsel for Zawar Shah, co-accused, argued his bail application. He said his client was implicated in the case on the statement of the co-accused which had no value in the eyes of law. His name was included in the light of the statement of former assistant commissioner Saeedabad Mansoor Abbasi under Section 161 CrPC. No evidence was produced in support of the allegations and no role was assigned to him, he added.
He said his implication in the case was hit by clause 38 of Qanoon-i-Shahdadat Ordinance 1984. He said that his client was not involved in the case directly or indirectly and nor any of his relative made any gain in the same illegally. He said he was private employee of Rehmatullah Solangi. 
He asserted he did not make transaction. About a reference by the NAB, the counsel said that under Section 18(f) of the National Accountability Ordinance 1999 (Amended Ordinance 2022) proceedings before this accountability court were formal reference and no new reference was to be filed after the provincial anticorruption court last year allowed NAB’s application to transfer proceedings to the accountability court. 
The counsel filed application under Section 497 read with Section 63 of CrPC for the acceptance of bail of Tabish Shah, former area manager of Sindh Bank.
Mr Lohar said his client could not be kept in custody for more than six months. He would argue his application on May 25. He, however, said that if further remand of his client was granted, it would be considered illegal under Section 10-A of NAO 1999. The court adjourned tmatter to May 25.

1,Nearly 200 Indian fishermen released,"“The first batch has 198 fishermen, the second will have 200 and the third about 100,” says PFF general secretary.","KARACHI: As many as 198 Indian fishermen released from the District Prison Malir left for Lahore by the Allama Iqbal Express that departed from the Cantonment Railway Station here on Thursday evening.
The original number of fishermen who were to be released was 200 but two fishermen had died earlier.
The deceased fishermen are Mohammad Zulfiqar, who died on May 6, and Soma Deva, who died on May 9. It is said that they had been unwell for quite some time. Their bodies have been kept in the Edhi Foundation mortuary till they could be flown out to India.
Soma’s nephew Sagar Samji said that he himself was arrested at sea for crossing over some four-and-a-half years ago. One year later his uncle too was caught the way he was and brought to the Malir jail.
“He [Soma] was sick and the jail authorities sent him to hospital from where he returned soon but did not look too well. When he took a bad turn, they sent him to hospital a second time where he passed away,” the nephew said.
“What I’m dreading now is that I have to go home alone and break the bad news to my aunt,” he said with a lump in his throat.
About Zulfiquar, it was said that he died of a massive heart attack. Both the deceased fishermen knew that they were going to be released soon and were looking forward to going home.
Some of the other fishermen about to board the train from Karachi also looked unwell.
Meero Misri had his right arm in a sling and he was leaning heavily on an orthopedic walking stick. “I had a stroke in jail,” he said, adding that he had been behind bars here for some three-and-half years.
“While I was here, my wife Navratna was running the home, taking care of our four young children by working as a labourer. Now I’m going back and am afraid that I will be another burden for her because I cannot work in this condition,” he said sadly.
But there was rejoicing too among most other fishermen. “I have my parents, wife and two boys awaiting my return back home,” said Ram Singh, imprisoned here for the last seven years. He said what he missed here, more than even his family, was home-cooked meals. “Both my mother and wife cook delicious food but you know what? I am an even better cook than them. So I missed catching fish and cooking it,” he said.
“I have been on the Al Hazrat train in India that takes you to Ajmer Sharif. It is so much nicer than this train,” said Irfan Qasim, a Muslim Indian fisherman when asked if he liked the Allama Iqbal Express or trains in India. “Still, I am grateful for your hospitality,” he smiled.
Three hundred more to walk to freedom
Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum General Secretary Saeed Baloch said that in the first batch there are 198 fishermen going home. “The first batch has 198 fishermen, the second will have 200 and the third about 100,” he said.
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan Vice Chairperson Qazi Khizar said that all over the world, countries have friendly borders but here in Pakistan and India, we arrest anyone who accidentally crosses over. “We are neighbours with such a big border and things are this way. We don’t get to choose our neighbours. We might as well try to be a little friendly,” he said.
“When we can open Kartarpur, why can’t we open our seas for each other? It would certainly end the misery of these poor fishermen,” he said. “Think about it. They are saying that they have been in jail here for five years, seven years even, Their children have spent all this time without them and must be all grown up now. They have had to miss out on watching them grow,” he said.
Pakistani fishermen in Indian jails
Fishermen Cooperative Society, Sindh administrator Zahid Ibrahim Bhatti said that there are some 200 Pakistani fishermen languishing in Indian jails and hopefully they, too, would come home soon after release of so many Indian fishermen.
“These fishermen are innocent people. They are also very poor people who certainly don’t deserve being jailed for unknowingly having crossed over to a neighbouring country. After all there is no line in the sea to indicate a border,” he said. “I request governments of both Pakistan and India to come up with a joint policy of leniency for these poor innocent people instead of locking them in jail for years,” he added.
Gifts distributed
Faisal Edhi, who was distributing big red sacks full of gifts for the poor fishermen’s children along with Rs5,000 cash to each, said that he was feeling happier than even the fishermen that they have been released. “They are very hardworking people. Workers and labourers like them should never be behind bars because then it keeps them away from taking care of their families so dependent on their earnings,” he said.
The Indian fishermen’s train travel to Lahore was arranged by the Edhi Foundation. After reaching Lahore the fishermen will be handed over to the Federal Investigative Agency that will then take them to the Wagah border where they will be handed over to the Indian authorities.

2,Unelected person can become mayor after LG law amendement,• PA unanimously passes bill to change key condition in SLGA 2013 • Amendment enables PPP to field unelected Wahab for Kar...,"• PA unanimously passes bill to change key condition in SLGA 2013
• Amendment enables PPP to field unelected Wahab for Karachi mayor
KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly on Thursday unanimously approved an amendment to the Sindh Local Government Act (SLGA) 2013 that paved the way for any person, who has not been directly elected as chairman or vice chairman of a union committee/council (UC) in the province, to become mayor/deputy mayor and chairman/vice chairman of a district municipal corporation or district council for at least six months if elected with the majority of votes in a city/district council.
The Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 states any person could run for the polls of mayor, deputy mayor, chairman and vice chairman but has to be elected as a member of the respective council within six months to continue holding the office.
The SLGA 2013 stated that one had to be chairman of a UC in the jurisdiction of a metropolitan corporation to contest the mayoral election. But, in the new legislation, any person can contest the mayoral election.
Besides lawmakers belonging to the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the opposition Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) and the lone member of the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal Abdur Rashid of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) also supported the amended bill, which was passed unanimously as none of the Pakitan Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmakers turned up to the house on Thursday.
Wahab in the run for mayoral election
While the JI’s mayoral candidate Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has been elected as a UC chairman, the PPP despite being the single largest party in the metropolis has lacked any widely known candidate among those elected directly in the local government elections.
PPP sources said that the amendment will enable the ruling party to field former Karachi administrator Barrister Murtaza Wahab, who did not contest the direct election of a UC chairman, as its mayoral candidate.
The sources told Dawn that the decision to field Barrister Wahab as the PPP’s candidate for the office of Karachi mayor was taken by the top party leadership on Wednesday.
They said that party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari chaired a meeting of the office-bearers of the party at Bilawal House on Wednesday. Mr Bhutto-Zardari and PPP leader Faryal Taplur conveyed to other participants in the meeting that the party would field Murtaza Wahab as a its candidate for Karachi mayor.
The sources said that the top leadership ordered the Sindh chief minister and other government functionaries to amend the law when it was pointed out that Barrister Wahab was not an elected UC chairman and cannot contest the mayoral election because of restrictions in the SLGA 2013.
If elected as Karachi mayor, the PPP will ask Barrister Wahab to contest by-election on a UC seat from Gizri.
However, the sources said that the PPP will make a formal announcement regarding its candidates for mayors/chairmen of Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana and other districts at a later stage due to apprehensions of a legal challenge to the amended law.
Same provision existed in Musharraf’s era
The local government system introduced by former military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf had also allowed any person to contest the mayoral election and after election it was not mandatory for him/her to contest election and became a UC chairman.
“The same provision was there during Nazim’s local government system,” Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah told the house without mentioning Gen Musharraf’s name.
He said that the amendment was also earlier part of SLGA 2013 and it was in accordance with the constitutional provisions.

A judicial magistrate ordered the release of 25 detained people against a surety bond of Rs5,000 each.
Police had rounded up them during protests in different parts of the metropolis.
Fourteen suspects apprehended by the Ferozabad police and 11 others by the Tipu Sultan police were produced before the administrative judge of anti-terrorism courts, Karachi, and police sought their remand for questioning.
The police contended that the suspects had staged violent protests on the main Sharea Faisal, blocking the thoroughfare, resorting to rioting and causing damage to government and private property.

Many released on bail; ‘Missing’ PTI leader Ali Zaidi’s wife moves SHC to know his whereabouts

The administrative judge handed them over to the police on a five-day physical remand.
Around 25 workers booked and detained by the Shah Latif police were produced before a judicial magistrate of Mali) for remand. However, the PTI’s lawyers contended that the activists were holding peaceful protests and all the offences were bailable. The court ordered their release on bail.
Another 21 detained suspects were produced before a judicial magistrate in the District Court Malir and police sought their physical remand. The Police argued that they were apprehended from within the limits of the Quaidabad police station for rioting and damaging property. The court remanded them in jail custody on for 14 days.
‘Ali Zaidi missing’
Meanwhile, the wife of the PTI Sindh president Ali Haider Zaidi said that her husband was picked up by police a couple of days back from near Kalapul, but he was yet to be produced before any court of law.
Talking to media persons on the premises of the Sindh High Court, Yasmeen Ali Zaidi stated that she had approached the SHC for the recovery of her husband. She alleged that PTI provincial chief was “abducted” by police as his whereabouts were still unknown.
AIG says 223 in police custody
City police chief Javed Alam Odho has said that over one dozen FIRs have been registered against PTI leaders and workers on the charges of arson, terror etc.
“Eighteen FIRs have been registered against PTI leaders and workers and a total of 350 of them detained during the last two days,” said Additional IGP Karachi Javed Alam Odho.
He told Dawn that out of total detained persons, some of them were released by courts while a few others were found innocent. Thus as of today, total 223 PTI workers were in custody of the police. Mr Odho said that eight police officers and personnel, including those of SP and DSP ranks, were injured in stone pelting by PTI workers.
The AIG said that one prison van, one police mobile, one vehicle of KWSB and 25 motorcycles of private citizens were torched during arson acts.
He said that no incident of violence was reported on Thursday from any part of the city. PTI leaders had announced protests on Thursday at a few places but the police took ‘pre-emptive action’ and detained four men and women.
He said the police did not allow PTI workers from gathering at any place in the provincial capital on Thursday as the experience of the past two days showed that they could create a law and order situation by attacking law enforcers and damaging public and private properties.
Reports from some areas suggested that PTI workers held protests for a third consecutive day, against the arrest of their party chief.
South SSP Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that some 20-25 workers of the PTI, including women, held a protest at Teen Talwar on Thursday evening. He added that the police arrested five protesters, including three women.
The South police chief said that on Wednesday night also, some PTI workers had held a demonstration opposite Nuplex in DHA and the police detained seven of them.

7,Murad disagrees with MQM-P’s suggestion about treason trial of PTI leadership,Says he wants PTI lawmakers to ask for invoking Article 6 on Imran as MQM-P had done; Sindh PA adopts resolution to condemn violent protests.,"KARACHI: Amid absence of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmakers, the treasury and opposition members joined hands to condemn through a unanimous resolution the violent incidents during protests by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf workers and supporters over the recent arrest of PTI chairman Imran Khan.
The resolution said: “This House condemns the violence perpetrated by PTI workers at the behest of PTI leaders against the lawful arrest of Imran Khan. This House condemns the way and manner public as well as private properties of the citizens of Pakistan has been ransacked, damaged and torched to somehow influence or impede the lawful process being carried out against Imran Khan”.
According to the resolution, the house resolves that rule of law must prevail at all times and no one should be allowed to take law into his own hands; and requests the provincial government to ensure complete protection to public as well as private properties of citizens and take strict action against anyone who violates the law.

Sindh PA adopts resolution to condemn violent protests over ex-PM’s arrest

Speaking on the resolution, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah said that the provincial government would not spare anyone involved in the violent acts during which public and private properties had been damaged.
“After Imran Khan’s arrest, some protesters came out in Karachi, Hyderabad and other districts … holding peaceful protest is the right of everyone but no one will be allowed to take the law into his hands … those who came out against the motherland will be taken to task,” he said.
“The faces of those ransacking the public and private properties are recognisable and no one would be spared,” he added. He, however, did not agree to Muttahida Qaumi Movement-P members’ suggestion that proceedings against PTI leaders and workers be initiated under Article 6 of the Constitution.
He said that Syed Sardar Ahmad of the MQM-P had asked for such a trial against MQM founder Altaf Hussain. The chief minister said he wanted PTI lawmakers to come to the assembly and ask for invoking Article 6 on Imran Khan as the MQM-P had done.
 






“Now time has come for PTI and they (PTI lawmakers) should be given a chance to come and sit here,” the CM added.
Muhammad Hussain Khan of the MQM-P had moved an amendment to the original resolution asking the house to demand proceedings against Imran Khan under Article 6 the Constitution.
“We should not only be condemning as they attacked sovereignty of the country,” he said.

10,Court issues notices to police officers over man’s death in ‘staged’ encounter,"HYDERABAD: Additional District Judge-VII has issued notice on an application, seeking registration of FIR against...","HYDERABAD: Additional District Judge-VII has issued notice on an application, seeking registration of FIR against respondents over their failure to comply with court’s order for formation of an inquiry team to probe extrajudicial killing of a suspect by Hyderabad and Khairpur police.
The court asked on Wednesday all the respondents to appear in court on May 13. 
The application was filed by Ms Reshma, sister of a suspect Farhan Siyal, who was allegedly gunned down by police in a staged police encounter on March 28. 
Ms Reshma, who was represented by Raja Jawad advocate, had nominated DIG Police Hyderabad Pir Mohammad Shah as an accused in the FIR she was seeking. Inspector General of Police (IGP) Sindh was cited as respondent in the case.
She said that she had evidence available with her and proof that Rs10 million were paid as ransom to police for her brother’s release but even then he was not released and murdered forcing her to file the application under section 22 A & B of Cr.PC seeking registration of FIR and formation of joint investigation team (JIT).
She said that on April 18 the court had passed the order in the light of the apex court’s Sughra Bibi case as reported in Pakistan Legal Decisions of SC 595. The court had passed such directives to the respondents, she said. 
She said that the proposed accused had violated court’s order and did not pay heed to the directive to constitute the team and submit report by May 10. The official had failed to comply with both directions, she said.
She said that DIG being a responsible officer had failed to discharge his duties in accordance with law and demonstrated contemptuous attitude towards the court.
She prayed the court that the respondent IGP should be directed to appoint a police officer to register case against DIG Hyderabad and till then he be stopped from influencing the case.
She requested the court to direct the respondent to suspend the DIG till investigation in her FIR filed at Phulelli police station was completed. IGP Sindh should be directed to constitute JIT comprising officers of police, Rangers, MI, ISI and other members of law enforcing agencies, she said.
The judge had ordered formation of a team of two police officials - not below the rank of ASPs - from any district other than Hyderabad or the same division who would conduct a thorough investigation into the alleged police encounter. 
He ordered that the team consider all aspects of the case and especially the applicant’s version. All parties had the right to produce evidence in support of their claims and the team would be at liberty to call for verification of all sorts of evidence including weapons, bank accounts, mobile phones, cause of death including exhumation of body (of the deceased Farhan Siyal), he said.
The entire exercise should be completed within shortest possible time and the report be submitted to magistrate on or before May 10. The court said that if the team could not complete the investigation within time it could seek extension in time from the magistrate concerned after giving valid reason.
The judge passed the order on Ms Reshma’s application, who sought registration of FIR against Hyderabd SSP Amjad Shaikh, Khairpur Mirs SSP Rohil Khoso, Hyderabad CIA in-charge Muneer Abbasi, Khairpur Mirs CIA in charge Hanif Khoso, sub-inspector Ayaz Bughio and others for his brother’s murder by Hyderabad and Khairpur Mirs police in a staged encounter on March 28.
She had then filed an application with the DIG’s office asking him to constitute the JIT as per the judge’s directive. She also moved an application under section 176(ii) Cr.PC for exhumation of her brother’s body.
She said in her application that Farhan was kidnapped and police officials demanded ransom, which was paid by her family members. But even then he was not released and shot dead in front of her and other witnesses. He was booked in a false and concocted FIR, she said.
She said that at the time of his death he was injured but medico legal officer did not mention his nature of injuries inflicted through torture because of the influence of high ranked officials.
She said the injuries mentioned in his post-mortem report were not the actual ones and it was necessary to exhume the body to determine real facts.

He said in a statement issued here the other day that Pakistan government should introduce business friendly policies to save industrial and agricultural sectors.
He expressed concern over 25pc raise in bank markup under the dictates of International Monetary Fund (IMF) and said the government had increased tariff on gas, petrol, electricity etc to appease the IMF for meeting the lender’s conditionalities.
He said that it would increase cost of production whether recession was being observed in international market. Pakistani exporters were already facing serious conditions. Pakistan was already facing the tide of price hike, he said.
HCCI chief maintained that staff level agreement with IMF was already facing delays and it appeared that the government’s efforts had gone down the drain. Even after meeting IMF’s conditions the lender remained dissatisfied and assurances by friendly countries were also of no help, he said.
Siddiqui said that Pakistan’s industrial sector had collapsed and some industries were facing closure. This closure would lead to massive unemployment which was alarming, he said. 
He said that Pakistan’s business community had already expressed reservations over policies of State Bank of Pakistan. The highest markup rate in the region was the result of unfriendly industrial policies. Industrialists were facing psychological pressure and investment of industrialists had frozen, he said. 
He urged the government to find alternates to address this economic crisis. He said Pakistan government should introduce business friendly policies to save industrial and agricultural sectors.
