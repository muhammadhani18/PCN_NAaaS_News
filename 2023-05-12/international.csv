0,UK to roll out first driverless bus service,"Policy director of Stagecoach says service would be safer, more fuel efficient and would offer a better experience for customers.","QUEENSFERRY: The UK will roll out its first driverless bus network in Scotland next week with drivers on standby behind the steering wheel, ready to take control should an emergency arise.
The service, which aims to carry 10,000 passengers a week over a 22.5-kilometre route on five single-deck buses, will be the world’s first automated local bus service, its operator said.
“The autonomous technology on this bus has been tested before but this is the first time that it has been put on to a bus that’s now a registered local bus service,” Peter Stevens, policy director of Stagecoach bus service, said after a demonstration near Edinburgh.
From Monday, the buses, which will travel at up to 50 miles per hour, will have a safety driver to monitor the technology, as required by UK law, which does not yet permit fully autonomous vehicles.
Drivers do not touch the controls while the vehicle is in autonomous mode, and a conductor onboard handles ticketing and passenger enquiries.
The onboard system will detect other road users to prevent collisions, while optical cameras and radar will scan the road to check for pedestrians.
The control system includes an artificial intelligence engine that receives information from throughout the bus to determine its exact location and calculate the safest route to its destination.
Stevens said the service would be safer, more fuel efficient and would offer a better experience for customers.
“The system is designed to increase safety,” he said.
“The driver has now got 360-degree vision, and the system can respond faster than a human can in terms of reaction time.
“There’s always going to be a safety driver in the seat even when the bus is driving itself. So that if there is a need for them to take control, they can take control.” Stevens said the buses would be learning the route continually and collecting thousands of hours of data a month.

1,US accuses S. Africa of weapon supply to Russia,Envoy says arming Russians is ‘extremely serious’,"JOHANNESBURG: The US envoy to South Africa on Thursday accused the country of having covertly provided arms to Russia despite its professed neutrality in the Ukraine war, local media said.
Ambassador Reuben Brigety told a media briefing the US was ‘confident’ weapons and ammunition had been loaded onto a Russian freighter that docked at a Cape Town naval base in December.
“The arming of the Russians is extremely serious, and we do not consider this issue to be resolved, and we would like (South Africa to start) practising its non-alignment policy,” Brigety was quoted as saying.
South Africa has refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine, which has largely isolated Moscow on the international stage.
The country — an African powerhouse that also wields moral clout for its victory over apartheid — says it wants to stay neutral, and champions dialogue as the means to end the conflict. But critics cite a number of recent incidents as evidence of a tilt towards the Kremlin.
Diplomatic dilemma
Earlier this year, it held a joint military exercise with Russia and China, and last month a sanctioned Russian military cargo plane landed at an air force base in the middle of the night to deliver what defence authorities described as ‘diplomatic mail’.
Ambassador Brigety appeared to refer to a previously known episode, when the Lady R, a cargo vessel under western sanctions flying a Russian flag, docked at South Africa’s largest naval base.
“Among the things we noted was the docking of the cargo ship in the Simon’s Town naval base between 6th to 8th December, 2022, which we are confident uploaded weapons and ammunition onto that vessel in Simon’s Town as it made its way back to Russia,” the envoy said.
Asked in parliament about the accusation, President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday said the matter concerning the Lady R was ‘being looked into’ and ‘in time we will be able to speak about it.’ South Africa has been walking a diplomatic tightrope over the Ukraine conflict.
The country has strong economic and trade relations with the US and Europe.
But it also has ties with Russia dating back decades, to when the Kremlin supported the now-ruling African National Congress (ANC) in its fight against apartheid.
It is a member of BRICS — a grouping bringing together Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — and has advocated for multilateralism as counterbalance to a US-led international order.
In March it was faced with a diplomatic dilemma after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is due to attend a BRICS summit in South Africa in August. The warrant meant that Pretoria would have to detain Putin on arrival.
In response, last month Ramaphosa said the ANC had resolved that South Africa should quit the ICC — before backtracking hours later citing what his office called a communication ‘error.’

2,Biden’s adviser met China’s chief diplomat in Vienna,"WASHINGTON: US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in Vienna this week, the...","WASHINGTON: US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in Vienna this week, the White House said on Thursday, seeking to maintain communication amid soaring tensions including over Taiwan.
“The two sides had candid, substantive, and constructive discussions on key issues” including the war in Ukraine and “cross-Strait issues,” the statement said, referring to Taiwan.
“The two sides agreed to maintain this important strategic channel of communication to advance these objectives,” the White House added.
The meeting in Vienna is likely to reignite speculation about a potential meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. Asked about the issue on Wednesday, Biden said there had been progress.
Washington and Beijing’s historically strained relationship has tightened further in recent months over commercial, political and military influence in the Pacific region.
The United States has sought leverage through its Quad partnership with India, Japan and Australia. The group denies hostile intentions and stress that they are not a military alliance, but China has described the grouping as an attempt to encircle it.
China claims Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to bring the island under its control one day, by force if necessary, and bristles at any official contact between Taipei and foreign governments.
Last month, a US warship sailed through the waters separating Taiwan and mainland China after Beijing launched three days of military exercises around the democratic self-ruled island.
The exercises came in response to a meeting between Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California.

3,Shooting at German car plant kills two,BERLIN: A shooting at a Mercedes-Benz plant in the city of Sindelfingen in south-western Germany left two men dead ...,"BERLIN: A shooting at a Mercedes-Benz plant in the city of Sindelfingen in south-western Germany left two men dead on Thursday, mounting pressure on Berlin to tighten the country’s already-strict gun laws.
Police arrested the suspect, a 53-year-old man, who opened fire on the victims before security workers at the site, some 17 km of Stuttgart, held him down and handed him over to authorities, police and the local prosecutor’s office said in a statement.
The victims, both 44, died of their injuries, they said.
Production at one of the company’s factory halls in Sindelfingen was suspended until the end of the week, an spokesperson for the automobile firm said.
“Otherwise, operations in the plant continue on schedule,” the spokesperson said of Sindelfingen, where the company’s flagship S-Class luxury sedan is produced.
The gunman and the two victims belonged to an external services provider, the company said, without providing further details on their roles.
The incident was the latest of a number of mass shootings in Germany in recent years, many of which had a connection with extremism. Invest­igators have yet to establish a motive for Thursday’s shooting.

4,Five arrested after blast near Golden Temple,"No injuries reported in the blast, which is the third in a week.","AMRITSAR: Five people were arrested on Thursday after a third blast in less than a week shook the area around the Sikh holy site of the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Indian police said.
Two of the suspects had prepared the improvised explosive devices at a guest house in the city, state police director general Gaurav Yadav told reporters, while the other three provided the materials. He gave no information about their suspected motives and said investigations were continuing.
Pressure for a separate Sikh homeland known as Khalistan sparked deadly violence in India in the 1980s and 1990s.
In March, a manhunt was launched in Punjab state to arrest a firebrand Sikh separatist that sparked protests and vandalism among the diaspora.
It was unclear whether that was connected to the three explosions. No injuries were reported in the third blast, which happened around midnight, with police describing it as low-intensity.
“The area is totally sealed and a forensic team is working on it,” police official Naunihal Singh said.

5,"Trump jokes about sexual abuse verdict, repeats litany of complaints",Plans to pardon convicts in Capitol riot if he wins in 2024,"GOFFSTOWN (US): An unrepentant Donald Trump held firm to past grievances at the first televised town hall of the 2024 US presidential election on Wednesday, stressing from the moment he took the stage that he has little intention of mounting a more disciplined campaign for his third White House bid.
In a contentious 70-minute broadcast, Trump drew laughter from a New Hampshire audience when he mocked writer E. Jean Carroll’s account of his having sexually abused her, repeated falsehoods about his 2020 election loss, said he would pardon many of his supporters convicted of taking part in a Jan 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, and called the CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins a ‘nasty person.’
Responding to questions from Collins and members of the audience at Saint Anselm College, Trump made no effort to offer more moderate positions on issues, which political analysts say is key to broadening his appeal to a wider swath of Republicans.
Asked by Collins whether he would acknowledge that he lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, the Republican Trump reasserted unfounded claims that the election was rigged against him, brushing aside her attempts to correct the record.

Plans to pardon convicts in Capitol riot if he wins in 2024

“That was a rigged election,” Trump said, adding that anyone who thought otherwise was ‘stupid.’ Trump, the front-runner in the race for the Republican nomination, declined to express regret for the deadly attack on the US Capitol when his supporters sought to prevent Congress from ratifying the election result, and he repeated his plan to pardon individuals involved if voters return him to the White House in 2024. Trump and Collins frequently spoke over each other with Collins challenging a number of the former president’s false claims.
Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, said Trump’s performance was a likely prelude to his 2024 campaign.
“It was classic Trump — it was Donald Trump from 2015 right up until now: The Big Lie, the outrageous style, demeaning individuals, mocking them,” said Rothenberg, senior editor at the Inside Elections newsletter.
“He hasn’t changed, nor will he. It was a glimpse into the next year and a half.” The audience of Republicans and independent voters who plan to vote in the Republican primary were generally very supportive of Trump, giving him a standing ovation when he took the stage.
New Hampshire is an early nominating state that could prove critical in Trump’s bid to win the November 2024 election. Some applauded when he described his Jan 6 speech and the events that led up to the Capitol riot in positive terms.
“I’ve never spoken to a crowd as large as that, and that was because they thought the election was rigged. They were there with love in their heart. That was unbelievable, and it was a beautiful day,” he said.
Responding to Trump’s remarks, Democratic National Committee chair Jaime Harrison issued a statement calling Trump a “dangerous, extreme candidate who seeks to undermine democracy.” Biden sought to fundraise off the event. “Do you want four more years of that? If you don’t, pitch in to our campaign,” Biden wrote on Twitter.

6,Iraqi museum damaged by IS works towards reopening,"“Part of this cavity will be preserved, as a witness throughout history to what has been perpetrated,” says provincial head of antiquities."," 

MOSUL: A man looks at broken artefacts at the museum in this northern Iraqi city.—AFP

MOSUL: Iraqi officials on Thursday said Mosul’s once-celebrated museum had entered the final stages of restorations ahead of a planned 2026 reopening after being closed to the public for 20 years.
The museum closed its doors in 2003, amid the chaos following the US-led invasion of Iraq, and was later ransacked by the militant Islamic State group after they seized the city in 2014.
“We are celebrating today, in the city of two springs, the launch of the Mosul Museum’s rehabilitation project,” the director of Iraq’s antiquities authority, Laith Majid, said at a press conference.
“This museum, an icon of museums in Iraq, was targeted by a blind barbarian assault,” Majid said, referring to the destruction by IS.
The jihadists used sledgehammers and power tools to deface ancient statues and pre-Islamic treasures housed in the museum, releasing an infamous video showing the destruction in 2015. A gaping hole remains in the floor of the museum’s famed Assyrian gallery, caused by a bomb explosion.
“Part of this cavity will be preserved, as a witness throughout history to what has been perpetrated,” said Khair al-Din Ahmed Nasser, head of antiquities in Nineveh province, of which Mosul is the capital.
A new display was inaugurated, showcasing the museum’s history, collection and current restoration plans, as part of efforts supported by France’s Louvre Museum, the Smithsonian Institute and the World Monument Fund.

7,UN rights council votes to strengthen monitoring of abuses in Sudan,GENEVA: The United Nations top rights body narrowly decided on Thursday to beef up monitoring of abuses amid...,"GENEVA: The United Nations top rights body narrowly decided on Thursday to beef up monitoring of abuses amid Sudan’s spiralling conflict, despite vehement opposition from Khartoum.
The UN Human Rights Council’s 47 members voted with 18 in favour, 15 opposed and 14 abstaining for a resolution calling for an end to the violence and strengthening the mandate of a UN expert on Sudan.
The resolution was adopted during a special council session, called following a request by Britain, Germany, Norway and the United States, and with the support of several countries, to urgently address the violence that erupted in Sudan on April 15.
The tight vote came after Arab countries and others, including China, called for countries to oppose the resolution, maintaining it infringed upon Sudan’s sovereignty, and African countries urged finding “African solutions to African problems”. But backers of the text insisted it was vital for the council to act swiftly.
“This is a really important day” British ambassador Simon Manley said, hailing the council for its “vote for peace.” Nearly a month into Sudan’s bloody conflict, civilians are still trying to flee, boarding evacuation planes with just a few belongings and leaving behind their homes, relatives and lives.
More than 750 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been displaced in the fighting that began on April 15 between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who commands the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
The fighting has plunged “this much-suffering country into catastrophe”, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said at the start of the one-day session.
Decrying “the wanton violence”, he called on “all states with influence in the region to encourage, by all possible means, the resolution of this crisis”. Thursday’s council session in Geneva was called to urgently address a situation that everyone present agreed was dire. But the mandate adopted was not very strong.
It called “for an immediate cessation of violence by all parties, without pre-conditions”, but refrained from ordering any new investigation into abuses.
Instead, it ordered the existing Special Rapporteur on the rights situation in Sudan to provide “detailed monitoring and documentation of... all allegations of human rights violations and abuses since the 25 October 2021, including those arising directly from the current conflict”, and to report his findings to the council. Even with such a weak text, it barely squeaked past.
Sudan’s ambassador Hassan Hamid Hassan vehemently opposed the special session and the resolution, insisting to the council that “what is happening in Sudan is an internal affair” and cautioning the session could distract from efforts to achieve a lasting ceasefire.
Without Sudan’s blessing, other African and Arab countries said they would not be able to support the resolution, while some other countries also expressed opposition.
“The international community should respect Sudan’s sovereignty and ownership of internal affairs,” China’s ambassador Chen Xu said.
Critics also charged that there had been no need to rush to hold a special session when the rights council’s next regular session is only weeks away.

8,Armenia-Azerbaijan clashes threaten peace talks,"YEREVAN: Armenia and Azerbaijan on Thursday blamed each other for an exchange of fire along their restive border,...","YEREVAN: Armenia and Azerbaijan on Thursday blamed each other for an exchange of fire along their restive border, which killed one person and wounded four days ahead of EU-hosted peace talks.Russia urged the sides to de-escalate tensions after the fatal exchange of fire, but its influence as a power broker in the region has waned since it launched its invasion of Ukraine last year.
Armenia initially said four of its soldiers had been wounded by incoming fire in an eastern region of the ex-Soviet country. “Azerbaijani forces are shooting artillery and mortars at Armenian positions in the Sotk region” the Armenia’s defence ministry said. Baku meanwhile accused Armenia of a “provocation” that had left one of its soldiers dead.
It said Armenian soldiers had “once again violated the ceasefire agreement” with “large-calibre weapons,” referring to an accord from November 2020 that ended six weeks of hostilities.
In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday: “We expect a restrained approach from the parties and urge them not to take any actions that could lead to an increase in tensions.”
Thursday’s flare up in fighting comes just days before European Council President Charles Michel is to host Armenia’s Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijan’s Ilham Aliyev for talks in Brussels.
The two leaders had also agreed to jointly meet the leaders of France and Germany on the sidelines of a European summit in Moldova on June 1, according to the EU.

9,WHO declares mpox no longer a health emergency,"“However, as with Covid-19, that does not mean that the work is over,” WHO chief warns.","GENEVA: The World Health Organisation declared that mpox no longer constitutes a global health emergency on Thursday, almost exactly a year after the disease formerly known as monkeypox started spreading globally.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the decision was prompted by sharply falling case numbers worldwide, but emphasised that the disease remains a threat, particularly in areas of Africa where it has long been endemic.
The announcement comes a week after the UN agency also declared that Covid-19 no longer constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), its highest level of alarm.
“However, as with Covid-19, that does not mean that the work is over,” Tedros told an online press conference.
“While the emergencies of mpox and Covid-19 are both over, the threat of resurgent waves remains for both. Both viruses continue to circulate and both continue to kill,” he added.
Though some countries in Central and West Africa have suffered local outbreaks for decades, in May last year mpox cases started emerging in Europe, North America then elsewhere, mostly among men who have sex with men.
The WHO declared mpox was a PHEIC in July. The number of people infected with the disease — which causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions — has consistently fallen since.
More than 87,000 cases and 140 deaths have been reported from 111 countries during the global outbreak, according to a WHO count.
The countries with the most cases during the global outbreak have been the United States, Brazil, Spain, France, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and the UK, according to the count.
Steady progress’
Almost 90 per cent fewer cases were recorded over the last three months compared to the previous three-month period, Tedros said.
“We now see steady progress in controlling the outbreak based on the lessons of HIV and working closely with the most affected communities,” Tedros said.
Because the global cases were overwhelmingly among men who have sex with men, there were fears that discrimination would mar the response to the outbreak.
“While stigma has been a driving concern in managing this epidemic and continues to hamper access to care for mpox, the feared backlash against the most affected communities has largely not materialised,” Tedros said.
“For that, we are thankful.” For non-endemic countries, infections spread by travellers represent an ongoing threat, Tedros said, calling on countries to maintain surveillance of the disease and access to tests and vaccines.
People who have untreated HIV are at particular risk of severe forms of mpox, he added.
“While we welcome the downward trend of mpox cases globally, the virus continues to affect communities in all regions, including in Africa, where transmission is still not well understood,” Tedros said.
The monkeypox virus — which causes mpox disease — was first discovered in humans in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970.

Biden said the purpose of his trip last month was “to make sure... the Brits didn’t screw around” with peace in Northern Ireland, and “didn’t walk away from their commitments”.
The comments, relayed in a White House transcript, came as Biden addressed a Democratic party gathering in New York on Wednesday.
Biden visited Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to mark the 25th anniversary of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, which ended three decades of violence in the UK province, with US mediation.
During the visit, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) lawmaker Sammy Wilson accused the Irish-American president of being “anti-British”, and he was angered by the latest intervention.
“If you believe that there should be a special relationship between the US and UK then at least show us some respect,” Wilson told London’s Evening Standard newspaper.
“It’s unbelievable and frightening as well to think this is the man who is the leader of the free world,” he added.

11,Russia wary of extending Ukraine grain deal,"ISTANBUL: Ukraine, Russia, Turkiye and the United Nations discussed on Thursday UN proposals to extend a deal...","ISTANBUL: Ukraine, Russia, Turkiye and the United Nations discussed on Thursday UN proposals to extend a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukraine grain, which Moscow has threatened to quit on May 18 over obstacles to its grain and fertiliser exports.
The UN and Turkiye brokered the Black Sea agreement in July last year to help tackle a global food crisis that has been worsened by Moscow’s war in Ukraine. At the same time, the UN agreed to help Moscow facilitate its own agricultural shipments.
The meeting of senior officials in Istanbul on Thursday appeared to end without Russian agreement to extend the Black Sea deal. The Kremlin said earlier on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin could speak with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan at short notice if needed regarding an extension of the deal, but there were no such plans at present.
“The meeting discussed the recent proposals by the United Nations, namely the resumption of the Togliatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline, the longer extension of the deal, improvements at the Joint Coordination Centre for stable operations and exports, as well as other issues raised by the parties,” the UN said.
“The parties presented their views and agreed to engage with those elements going forward,” the UN said in a statement.
Russian demands
Turkiye’s Defence Ministry said progress was made in the talks on the Black Sea grain deal and that the parties agreed to continue four-way technical meetings on the deal. On Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said he thought the deal could be extended for at least two more months.
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said after the talks on Thursday that the grain deal should be extended for a longer period and expanded. He said the talks would continue online.
Russia has issued a list of demands regarding its own agricultural exports that it wants met before it agrees to an extension of the deal. Those include restarting a pipeline that delivers Russian ammonia to a Ukrainian Black Sea port, which the UN has been pushing for.
While those Russian exports are not subject to Western sanctions imposed following the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Moscow says restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance are a barrier to shipments.
“Let me be clear, Russia is exporting just fine. It is exporting grain and fertiliser at the same levels, if not higher, than before the full scale invasion (of Ukraine),” US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters.
Another key Russian demand is returning access to the Swift payment system for the Russian Agricultural Bank, known as Rosselkhozbank, which was cut off by the European Union in June over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
As an alternative the United Nations proposed other banks could help process payments. Reuters has reported that JPMorgan has processed the first payments for the Russian Agricultural Bank and could process dozens more, however Moscow has said this is not a long term fix.
‘Weaponising food’
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin, speaking to Russian media in Istanbul, said on Thursday that if Russia’s demands remained unresolved, then the Black Sea deal would “cease its existence”. He specifically cited Swift access.
Some 30 million metric tonnes of grain and foodstuffs has been exported from Ukraine under the deal, including nearly 600,000 metric tonnes of grain in World Food Programme vessels for aid operations in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Yemen, the United Nations has said.
Officials from Russia, Ukraine, Turkiye and the UN make up a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul, which implements the Black Sea export deal. They authorize and inspect ships. No new vessels have been authorised by the JCC since Thursday.
In an excerpt of a letter seen by Reuters last month, Russia told its JCC counterparts that it will not approve any new vessels to take part in the Black Sea deal unless the transits will be done by May 18 - “the expected date of ... closure.” “This is Russia once again weaponising food,” Thomas-Greenfield said on Thursday. “They’re holding vulnerable and hungry people in Africa, the Middle East and around the world hostage”.
