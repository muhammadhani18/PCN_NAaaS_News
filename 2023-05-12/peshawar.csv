A bench consisting of Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Syed Arshad Ali directed the DG mines to maintain status quo over the issue till decision of an appeal filed by the petitioner, Hameedullah Paracha, before the mining appellate tribunal. 
The petitioner has challenged an advertisement of chromite mines measuring 224 acres in Kohistan on basis of joint venture and not sole proprietorship. 
The petitioner’s counsel, Nauman Muhib Kakakhel, stated that initially two mines marked as chromite A and chromite B were advertised on sole proprietorship basis and e-auction No. 18 was conducted for that purpose in which the petitioner was the highest bidder for both the mines collectively measuring around 500 acres. 
However, he stated that later on it was found that chromite A mine had already been advertised and won by another bidder in e-auction No. 17 due to which the authorities decided to cancel both the bids and advertised it afresh so as to avoid controversy.

ANP leader Mukhtiar Khan told journalists here on Thursday that the decision was made at Bacha Khan Markaz, the head office of party in Peshawar, and communicated to the candidates. He said that the candidates were told to make preparations for for the expected general elections.
It was the first time during the two-and-a-half decades that the family of late Rehmanullah did not get ANP ticket for polls. Ameer Rehman, the son of Rehmanullah, went to United Kingdom after he was blamed for the murder of a worker of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf during 2018 elections.

3,PHC asks PTI chief for response to plea seeking his disqualification,ANP leader insists Imran filed false asset declaration with nomination papers.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday put former prime minister and PTI chairman Imran Khan on notice seeking his response to a petition, which called for his disqualification from becoming a member of the National Assembly and heading his party Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).
Following preliminary hearing, a bench consisting of Chief Justice Musarrat Hilali and Justice Shakeel Ahmad directed Mr Imran to respond in writing to the joint petition of Awami National Party provincial president Aimal Wali Khan and voter from NA-25 Kurram tribal district Mohammad Tufail Shaheen.
Next hearing will be fixed later.
The petitioners claimed that the PTI chairman had concealed his assets and those of his wife in his nomination papers filed for the National Assembly by-elections in Oct last year, so he stood disqualified from holding any public office under articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution.

ANP leader insists Imran filed false asset declaration with nomination papers

They requested the high court to declare that on account of concealment of his and his spouse’s assets, Mr Imran was, on the day he filed nomination papers, not qualified to be elected as the member of the National Assembly.
The petitioners also said the court should declare that the PTI chief, by filing a false declaration of his assets with his nomination papers, had permanently rendered himself disqualified from holding any public office, including that of an MNA.
They requested the court to set aside the notification of Election Commission of Pakistan of Jan 19, 2023, declaring the respondent (Mr Imran) to have been elected as MNA from NA-45 (Kurram-I) as the same was illegal and in violation of the Constitution and the Elections Act, 2017.
The petitioners requested the court to bar the former prime minister from holding the position of the head of a political party (PTI) and declare illegal all his actions and decisions in that capacity.
Qazi Jawad Ehsanullah, the counsel for petitioners, said the ECP had announced on Sept 15, 2022, the holding of by-elections in eight National Assembly constituencies, including NA-45 Kurram tribal district.
He said PTI chief Imran had contested election on all eight seats, while the ECP declared him a returned candidate from seven of them, including NA-45, through a notification issued on Jan 19, 2023.
The lawyer also said the ECP issued an order on Feb 24 de-notifying the election of Mr Imran to six National Assembly seats, so he remained elected from the NA-45 constituency.
He argued that it was a matter of record that Mr Imran had, in his nomination papers, produced a false declaration of his assets and belongings concealing material information.
Mr Ehsanullah claimed that there was a long list of assets shown by the respondent in his income tax returns filed before the Federal Board of Revenue for the year 2021-22, but the same assets did not find any mention in the declaration of assets of the nomination papers.
He said the examination of those nomination papers revealed the concealment of Rs7 million jewellery, which the PTI chief “purchased and gifted” to his wife.
The lawyer said under Section 60 of the Elections Act read with Form A, an election candidate was obliged to submit and disclose all his assets and those of his spouse and dependent children.
He added that if the candidate concealed or held back assets and did not disclose the same, he was guilty of ‘making and publishing a false statement or declaration’ within the meaning of Section 173 of the Elections Act rendering himself not qualified or disqualified from being nominated and elected as a member of the National Assembly.

ROAD CLEARED: The National Highway Authority on Wednesday cleared part of the snow-hit Mansehra Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road to traffic.
“We cleared the MNJ Road up to the Naran area and are working to reopen it up to Babusar Top,” NHA deputy director Javed Saifullah told reporters.
The road was blocked to traffic after the Kaghan valley received record snowfall in November last year.
Mr Saifullah said as the removal of snow from other sections of the MNJ Road was under way, the artery would be cleared up to Battaka Kundi by May 23, up to Gattidas by June 15 and up to Babusar Top later.
He, however, said inclement weather could delay work.
NHA inspector Latif Anwar said avalanches hit the MNJ Road at five points in the valley hampering work but he hoped that the weather would be clear in the days ahead facilitating the reopening of road.
Meanwhile, Kaghan Hoteliers Association president Seth Matiullah and chairman Hussain Deen welcomed the reopening of the MNJ Road and said they and other hotel owners invited visitors to the scenic Kaghan valley.
Meanwhile, the tehsil municipal administration on Thursday began a campaign against encroachments in Mansehra city and its suburbs. The TMA officials accompanied by the police personnel removed illegal temporary structures and handcarts from the Abbottabad Road, Kashmir Road and Shinkiari Road.
TMA official Mohammad Iqbal said the drive would continue until all encroachments were removed from the roads and on their sides.
He said notices were served on encroachers in Lari Adda and city areas to voluntarily remove illegal roadside structures to prevent a crackdown.

6,JUI-Fazl withdraws iddat case against Imran,PHC bench observes issues raised were political in nature and were not related to the case.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday disposed of a petition seeking the disqualification of former prime minister and PTI chairman Imran Khan from contesting the National and provincial assembly elections for marrying his current wife during her iddat period.
The development came after the plea was withdrawn by two Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl members, including JUI-F office secretary Ahmad Ali and party candidate for last year by-polls in Kurram tribal district Jamil Khan.
A bench consisting of Chief Justice Musarrat Hilali and Justice Shakeel Ahmad held preliminary hearing into the petition, which said that former PM Imran Khan was not qualified under Article 62 (1)(d),(e),(f) and (g) of the Constitution to contest elections in the country and therefore, he should be disqualified.
The lawyer to petitioners claimed that Mr Imran violated Islamic principles and committed a major sin as he solemnised nikkah with his current wife at a time when her iddat period of four months and 10 days after divorce from her previous husband was not covered.
The chief justice observed that the iddat period for a woman after divorce was three months, whereas the period of four months and 10 days was required as iddat for a widow.
The counsel said recently, a confession was made by the PTI chairman’s nikkahkhwan, Mufti Saeed Khan, on a private television channel that Mr Imran didn’t inform him about the iddat period at that time of marriage and therefore, the marriage was unlawful.
He added that the nikkahkhwan repeated that nikkah ceremony afterwards.
The lawyer said Mr Imran raised the issue of a diplomatic cipher carrying the details of the purported American threat to his government, declared his removal as the PM an American conspiracy, and had been issuing baseless statements against the Pakistan Army.
The bench observed that the issues raised were political in nature and were not related to the case.
It added that the petitioners didn’t have “valid grounds” to support their contention. After a preliminary hearing by the court, the petitioners decided to withdraw their plea.
The petitioners had claimed that Mr Imran had portrayed himself as a religious, honest and patriotic man, who was ‘Sadiq and Ameen’ under Article 62 of the Constitution, but in light of certain revelations and confessions of various people involved in his personal life, he was not a man of good character in line with that constitutional provision.
They also referred to the memoir of Mr Imran’s former wife Reham Khan saying the book published in 2018 revealed several “affairs” of the former prime minister showing that he was not sagacious, righteous, non-profligate and honest within the meaning of Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution.

According to a statement, an emergency general body meeting of Pedo Officers Association was held wherein serious concerns were shown over interfere in the working of the organisation and levelling of false allegations against its top management through various inquiries. 
The participants of the meeting said that such steps were meant to weaken a developed organisation like Pedo. They appreciated Pedo chief Engineer Mohammad Naeem Khan for solving the longstanding problems of employees by approving service rules for them from the cabinet.
They said that during his tenure, several energy projects were successfully completed that brought additional income of billions of rupees to the provincial kitty annually. They added that many energy projects were near completion. They decided to hold protests, go on strike and lock power plants if the Pedo chief was removed from his post illegally through any conspiracy. They said that the responsibility of any untoward incident would rest with the provincial administration.
The participants of the meeting also paid tributes to the senior officials of the energy and power department, who continued to resist illegal actions and interference in the affairs of the organisation. They said that posting and deputation of outsiders should be stopped immediately and important responsibilities should be assigned to the competent officers of the organisation.
Earlier last month, Election Commission of Pakistan through a letter had directed the energy and power department to remove Mohammad Naeem Khan. In the letter addressed to the chief secretary, ECP said that it had come to know that Mr Khan had political affiliations and was a politically-motivated person. 
“Being an administrative officer, he is influencing the people of the areas of Malakand division where Pedo projects are being executed,” it said.

9,Court seeks ECP’s response to plea for replacement of governor,Bench orders to club petition with that of PTI challenging delay in polls,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday sought response of Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to a plea seeking declaration that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governor had violated his oath of office by not giving date for general elections to the provincial assembly within 90 days of its dissolution so he should be replaced by the President of Pakistan with an acting governor.
A bench consisting of PHC Chief Justice Musarrat Hilali and Justice Shakeel Ahmad issued the order after preliminary hearing of a petition filed by Advocate Mohammad Muazzam Butt, affiliated with Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf. The petitioner has requested the high court to order the provincial caretaker government to vacate their offices as rendering the continuation of such government beyond 90 days is nullity in law and without jurisdiction.
The bench also ordered that the present petition should be clubbed with a petition of PTI, challenging delay in holding of general elections to KP Assembly.
Muazzam Butt contended that on failure of the governor in the performance of his functions under the Constitution, he was no longer entitled to exercise the power of fixing election date beyond the prescribed period of 90 days and likewise ECP would also not be bound to seek the poll date from him.

He also requested the court to issue directives to the federal interior ministry to consider the “conduct and guilt” of the governor in breach of his constitutional responsibility at the scale of Article 6 of the Constitution, dealing with high treason, for necessary action.
The petitioner contended that the governor committed breach of his constitutional responsibility and violated his oath prescribed under 3rd Schedule read with Article 102 of the Constitution. He added that he violated fundamental rights of citizen of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to be represented through chosen representatives within the period of 90 days since the dissolution of provincial assembly on the advice of the then chief minister.
The petitioner stated that the Supreme Court in a suo moto case in the current year observed that the governor breached his constitutional responsibility in for not fixing a date for holding general elections to the assembly of the province.
He said that since the dissolution of the assembly on January 18 more than 90 days had already passed, therefore, the life of the caretaker government had ended as such any action or in action of such government would be nullity in law.
He contended that the governor was mandated to fix the election date within 90 days since the dissolution of the assembly in the manner provided in Constitution.
An additional attorney general, Sanaullah Khan, said that the governor had already given date of October 8 for holding polls and the same was notified by ECP. He added that holding polls was responsibility of ECP and not the governor.
To a query by the bench, the AAG stated that the governor could not be replaced in such a manner. He said that an acting governor could only be appointed when the governor was either out of the country or facing health issue.
The petitioner said that the governor by not acting in obedience to the Constitution in discharge of his required function under Article 105 (3) and Article 224 (2) read with 3rd Schedule to the Constitution related to the oath of the office had in essence abrogated, attempted to abrogate the Constitution and had exposed himself to the guilt of high treason.
