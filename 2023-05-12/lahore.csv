According to the reports, police arrested more suspects on Thursday in the wake of the criminal cases registered against the protesters in Lahore and other parts of the province.
A spokesperson for the Punjab Police released official figures, saying that with the new arrests of the PTI workers and the leaders made on Thursday across the province, the tally of arrests reached 2,250.
Of them, the Lahore police claimed to have arrested over 200 people and lodged 11 cases against them for attacks on police and damage to public and private buildings.

PTI workers, police scuffles continue even after Imran’s release order; tally of arrests now 2,250

A source said the police have registered 200 FIRs against the PTI leaders and workers across the province.
On the other hand, brief clashes were reported all day with intervals between the police and the PTI workers at the Liberty Roundabout and Zaman Park.
According to the reports that emerged in the evening, all the main roads of the provincial capital, including a part of Main Boulevard, Gulberg, got cleared by the military troops as well as the police for the traffic and the general public.
The Rangers held a flag march on some major arteries of Lahore to show their presence.
The Liberty Roundabout has been the favourite place for the PTI workers to gather to lodge agitation or enjoy celebrations. For the last two days, the area has been a battlefield when the party workers gathered in large numbers there to protest the arrest of their leader Imran Khan and turned violent later on.
Late on Wednesday, the situation was reported very alarming and tense at Kalma Chowk Underpass and a patch of Main Boulevard, Gulberg, from Liberty Chowk to Siddique Trade Centre where fierce scuffles broke out between the police and the PTI workers which continued until the wee hours on Thursday.
According to reports, the violent protesters threw stones on police personnel, damaged several cars and set two containers on fire at Kalma Chowk Underpass. They also set another on fire later that led to a strong explosion in its fuel tank. The incident occurred at around 1am near Kalma Chowk underpass and the video clips emerged later showed the people running for shelter to avoid huge flames of fire.
Some eyewitnesses said the police later used force and tear gas to disperse the violent mob besides making many arrests of the party workers.
Later in the day, the military troops were seen patrolling the Jail Road, Mall Road, Lahore Canal in Cantonment and other the major arteries of Gulberg.
However, a large number of PTI workers again gathered at Zaman Park shortly after the Supreme Court issued orders for releasing Imran Khan.
According to the reports, the scuffle broke out between the police and the PTI workers who were celebrating the release of the party chairman.
The PTI workers pelted the police with stones while the police fired tear gas to disperse them. Both sides blamed each other for the unrest.

The Ghalib Market police had registered the case against Elahi and others on charges of hurling stones and petrol bombs at the police and Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) teams.
The police alleged that dozens of people attacked the personnel and protected Mr. Elahi from being arrested in the case.
The court had granted pre-arrest bail to Elahi till May 11 but he did not appear before the court on the expiry of the bail. A counsel of Elahi submitted an application for a one-time exemption from personal appearance on medical grounds.
However, the court turned down the request and observed that pre-arrest bail could not be extended without personal appearance. The court withdrew the previous bail order and dismissed the petition.
Separately, a special court extended the pre-arrest bail of Mr Elahi till May 25 in a case of receiving kickbacks registered by the ACE.
Mr. Elahi did not attend the hearing and the court allowed his application for a one-time exemption from personal appearance on medical grounds.
The ACE accuses Elahi and his son, Moonis Elahi, of receiving kickbacks of Rs120 million in payments made to a foreign contractor of the Lahore Waste Management Company.
CHEEMA: An ATC judge denied physical remand of former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema to police and sent him to jail on judicial remand in a case of ransacking public and private property after the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan in a corruption case.
The police presented Cheema and 50 workers of the PTI before the court and sought their physical remand for investigation. However, Judge Abher Gul Khan turned down the request and sent Cheema and others to jail on judicial remand.

2,Pleas filed for recovery of PTI activists from ‘illegal’ custody,Multiple petitions filed in LHC for recovery of PTI's Alia Hamza and other workers from alleged illegal custody of police.,"LAHORE: Multiple petitions have been filed in the Lahore High Court for the recovery of PTI leader Alia Hamza and workers of the party from alleged illegal custody of police.
Hamza Jamil Malik, the husband of Alia, in his petition alleges that the police barged into his house without any search warrants, violated the sanctity of the four walls and abducted his wife.  
He asks the court to get his wife recovered from the illegal detention of the police and set her free.
Other petitions seek recovery of the PTI workers arrested by the police and detained under section 16 MPO including Mumtaz Hussain, Mian Muhammad Akram and Mian Muhammad Haroon Akbar.
Rabia Sultan, wife of former governor and PTI leader Omar Sarfraz Cheema, also filed a petition for the recovery of her husband from the custody of the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE).  
The petitioner states that the ACE arrested her husband unlawfully without any charge against him. She says over a dozen personnel of the ACE trespassed on her house late at night, manhandled the family members and took Cheema with them.
She argues that her husband is in illegal custody of the respondents without any cause or reason.
She asks the court to order the respondents to produce Cheema and also take action against them for keeping him in illegal custody.

3,Markets defy PTI’s strike call,LAHORE: All markets across the provincial capital remained open on Thursday after the trade organisations...,"LAHORE: All markets across the provincial capital remained open on Thursday after the trade organisations representing wholesalers and retailers widely rejected the call for a shutter-down strike by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in protest at the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan.
“We have also decided not to heed such calls in the future,” commented a shopkeeper while talking to Dawn here at Lahore’s G-1 market in Johar town.
“We also condemn violence, ransacking, and setting state-owned and private properties, including the house of Lahore corps commander, on fire by instigating party workers and carrying out terrorist activities,” he deplored.
Lahore has roughly 500 major and small wholesale and retail markets. Of them, nearly 50 markets attract a huge number of shoppers within Lahore and from other cities of Punjab. The major markets in Lahore include Shah Alam Market, Azam Market, Anarkali, Neela Gumbadd, Hall Road, The Mall, Urdu Bazaar, Fish Market, Tolinton Market, Ferozepur Road, Marble and Tile Market, Akhbar Market, Mughalpura Market, Shadman Market, Moon Market, Karim Block Market, RA Bazaar, Iqbal Town (main boulevard market), Ichhra and Yatim Khana bazaar, Barkat Market, Gulberg Main Market, Johar Town G-1 Market, Faisal Town Civic Centre, Samanabad bazaar and car market, Johar Town car market, Thokar bazaar, city’s model bazaars, Litton Road auto market, Mozang, Abid Market, Multan Road market, and Township Madina Road market.
“Despite the fact that there was a threat of attacks on our shops, we kept our shops open to give a shut-up call to the PTI’s violence that caused massive damage to public and private property,” said another shopkeeper.
“Just imagine, they even did not spare our historical properties, including the Jinnah House in Lahore cantonment, the house being used by the Lahore corps commander.”
All Pakistan Anjuman Tajiran General Secretary Naeem Mir said that the opening of shops, markets, and businesses by the traders/business community reflects great unity among “patriotic” people of Pakistan. “Not a single market or business place was reported to be closed on Thursday, as all widely rejected the PTI call for a strike. It clearly shows that we are united and don’t want the party that has no interest in maintaining peace except carrying out destruction of the economy,” Mr. Mir claimed.
“We will never surrender to such a so-called political party, and we will continue our businesses to send them (the PTI) a message that we will never shut our businesses on your call,” he pledged.
He also criticized courts for turning a blind eye to the damage caused to the public and private properties in riots in Lahore and other major and small cities upon the arrest of Imran Khan.
Earlier, Lahore traders also held a press conference and pledged to resist all moves aiming to destruct businesses. They condemned the PTI leaders and activists for causing massive damage to the properties and said they would never become part of the PTI’s fascist agenda.
“Enough is enough,” said the APAT General Secretary Mr. Mir on the occasion.
“We also request the government to allow us to keep arms under shopkeepers so as to protect our businesses from rioters,” he sought.”

The party cancelled its scheduled protests and announced a gathering at Liberty Roundabout to welcome Supreme Court’s order declaring Imran Khan’s arrest from Islamabad High Court as illegal. The party leaders and workers also announced offering funeral prayers for all party workers, who died during clashes.  
However, the party spokesman could not ascertain till late night whether the party workers should reach Liberty Roundabout and offer funeral prayers or not.
The party leaders and workers also expressed their jubilation over the release of Imran Khan in different parts of the city as well as in other cities across the country.
The PTI has proclaimed that it will announce its political strategy after consultation with the party leadership. It stated the PTI believed in peaceful political struggle and expected that all state institutions would ensure Mr Khan’s security as per Supreme Court orders.
Meanwhile, PTI Central Punjab president Dr Yasmin Rashid in a video message lambasted the IG Police Dr Usman Anwar for passing derogatory remarks against her and added that she was a staunch advocate of peaceful protests as a matter of right.
Asserting that the PTI will continue peaceful protests for the protection of the Constitution and democracy in the country, Dr Rashid said the first-day videos, available on social media, explained that she was stopping everybody from destroying any public or private property. “Those were your Gullu Butts in the police that entered the PTI protest and destroyed public and private property to create anarchy,” she said and went on to say that people like you had destroyed Pakistan’s peace. “Your (IGP) commitment is towards Pakistan and not towards any political government,” the PTI leader added.
Dr Rashid also chided PML-N chief organiser Maryam Nawaz for her demand of “level playing field” and added that now she was labelling PTI as a terrorist organisation. She said the incumbent ‘fascist’ federal government was committing excesses against people of Pakistan that had no example in the history of Pakistan. “The PTI workers always staged protests in a peaceful manner and will continue doing so,” she added.

The protest was held as the annual general meeting of the European brand in Germany was being held to discuss its financial performance and vote on the issues at hand. 
The workers from various garment factories supplying their products to the international brand assembled in the industrial area to raise their voice against violations of their rights, underpayments, long working hours, denial of sick leaves, and poor occupational health and safety arrangements, etc. 
They raised slogans, demanding their wages as per the law, respect of their labour rights, end to union busting, right to form trade unions and payment of dues at retirement. 
Punjab Textile Power-loom Garment Workers Union General Secretary Niaz Khan said 500 garment workers in the brand’s supply chain in Cambodia had been fighting for three years for €1 million in severance fund. Likewise, he added, thousands of workers across several factories in Indonesia were denied millions in severance over a decade ago, while the story was no different for many workers in the brand’s supply chain in Pakistan.

She said the workers should also be paid the minimum wages as per law and official notification.

Zulfikar Ali Badr said in a statement here on Thursday that the situation that developed during the last two days in the country was very regrettable and the rioting by the PTI activists on Wednesday night in Lahore was condemnable. He said the state property had not been damaged even when PPP founder chairman Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had been hanged though some diehard workers had resorted to self-immolation then. 
He said that Benazir Bhutto was also martyred but Asif Ali Zardari raised the slogan of ‘long live Pakistan’.
Mr Badr said the PTI had been criticising the amendments to the national accountability law but its chief Imran Khan is the first beneficiary of the amended law as instead of 90 days he was remanded only for 14 days in NAB custody.  
Punjab PPP general secretary Syed Hasan Murtaza alleged that the PTI supporters and Imran Khan are followers of Indian extremist leader Bal Thackeray.
In a statement, he said the PTI is no longer a political party but a group of miscreants. What the PTI did to Pakistan, even banned organisations could not do. 
He said Imran pushed the country towards chaos to fulfill his nefarious agenda as sensitive buildings and government installations were systematically attacked. Baton-wielding armed mobs damaged public property and vehicles and looted shops, he said, alleging that the PTI targeted every institution that protects Pakistan.

10,Heavy traffic banned on 2km portion of Jalalpur Jattan Road,DC bans vehicles on collapsed portion from Kutchery Chowk to Boley Bridge,"


 
GUJRAT: The district administration has banned entry of heavy traffic to the 2km portion of the Jalalpur Jattan Road, leading to the University of Gujrat (UoG). 
The ban has been imposed after the deterioration of the road whose concrete slabs have already been damaged at various locations.  
The civil society has been expressing apprehensions of a fatal accident of a heavy vehicle such as the busses of the UoG as well as private transport, trucks and heavy trailers that ply on the damaged portions of the road. 
The civic authorities and roads department had repaired some portions of the road with sand and mud on its both sides but the temporary arrangement has again been damaged in the recent rains.  

DC bans vehicles on collapsed portion from Kutchery Chowk to Boley Bridge

The road is damaged at least seven points from Kutchery Chowk to Boley Bridge due to leakage in the sewerage; however, laying of storm water pipeline in the last couple of years by digging of road on both sides further damaged the already affected road that has become hollow underneath the concrete slabs.  
Deputy Commissioner Safdar Virk, through an order issued here on Thursday, imposed the ban on entrance of heavy vehicles between the Kutchery Chowk and Boley Bridge along Jalalpur Jattan Road with immediate effect. 
The order said the decision had been made after consultation with the authorities in the Gujrat Municipal Corporation and public health and engineering department.  
Official sources say the local authorities are afraid of repairing the damaged portions to avoid any further loss to the road that actually needs rebuilding and huge funds are required for the purpose. And it’s hard to get funds approved in the caretaker set-up in Punjab.  
The local traders, management of educational institutions located along the road, students and parents have been demanding the rehabilitation of the road since long but to no avail.
