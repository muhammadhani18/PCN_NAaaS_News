1,Drumbeating tradition still alive in capital,"In Ramazan, drumbeaters visit various streets usually around 3 to 4am","The centuries-old tradition of a drumbeater waking up people for sehri remains alive even in the federal capital.
For centuries, the majority of people would wake up to the loud drumbeats in the wee hours heralding the beginning of sehri time during Ramazan. However, with modern technology, this tradition has declined but is still kept alive by drum beaters like Faqeer Hussain.
Hussain still beats the drum at sehri and wakes up the people in sector G-7, Islamabad.
Talking to The Express Tribune he said “I feel very happy to wake the people up. I have never enjoyed any other event like this and feel that I am doing a religious activity. I do not perform this duty for the sake of money but only for the hereafter.”
He went on to add: “It’s not that the people of my area do not have modern equipment, they do have, but they want to keep this custom alive.”
The drumbeaters visit various streets, usually around 3 to 4am. Most of the time, they call out loudly, “Utho rozay daro” and make sure that the thunderous beat of their drum along with their slogans is loud enough to wake up the residents of a particular locality.
Those who perform this duty during the Ramazan, go from house to house to receive their reward at the end of the holy month. The locals give cash, clothes and rations of their free will, which helps them celebrate Eidul Fitr better.
Professor Chaudhry Rasheed Sal said: “Due to the use of advanced technology, the tradition of waking people up at sehri has changed as the majority of people now use alarms and digital clocks to wake up for sehri.” However, he said keeping the centuries-old traditions alive is a very positive activity and should be encouraged, adding that all these traditions make our country more beautiful.
He said even though people had modern devices to help them wake up, they wanted to keep the tradition alive and encouraged the ‘dhol wala’. In some areas, Qawwali performers are also seen in action visits from one street to another soon after iftar or before iftar.

2,Educators’ body seeks regularisation of teachers,Expresses concerns about lack of consideration for merit in hiring process,"The Second Shift Teachers Association (SSTA) of Abbottabad district on Saturday urged the provincial government to regularise teachers employed under the Double Shift School (DSS) programme.
Specifically, the association has called for a halt to the termination of contracts for teachers working in second-shift schools, who are being replaced by new hires.
These second-shift teachers have demonstrated exceptional dedication and resilience in managing their responsibilities under challenging circumstances. They have worked tirelessly, sacrificing their time and resources, to ensure the success of this project.
Despite facing numerous hardships, they have persevered, likening their efforts to the nurturing of a plant from seed to fruit. However, despite their contributions and achievements, these dedicated educators are now facing the unjust termination of their contracts. The association highlights the irony of the situation, where those who planted and nurtured the seed of success are being deprived of its fruits, while others are benefiting from their labour.
Moreover, the association raises concerns about the lack of consideration for merit in the replacement process. It alleges that individuals are being appointed based on personal preferences rather than qualifications and merit, further exacerbating the injustice faced by the affected teachers.

The RPO assured to call a joint meeting of police officers and business representatives after Eid and to make the Safe City project fully operational by the end of May.
RCCI President and Rawalpindi Waste Management Company Chairman Saqib Rafiq along with group leader Sohail Altaf expressed deep concerns over the rising crime incidents with the traders.

6,"Ramazan, Eid bazaars to be wrapped up today",Provincial govt fails to establish Ramazan Sasta bazaars this year,"The Ramazan Model bazaars and Eid bazaars established across the Rawalpindi district from the 1st day of the fasting month will be wrapped up on Monday (today).
According to officials, these markets will cater to the needs of shoppers until Maghrib prayers. There will be no Ramazan Model and Eid bazaar available on Tuesday. Additionally, the powers granted to 60 officers of the Revenue Department, including tehsildars, naib tehsildars, gurdawars, and senior patwaris, to monitor and address inflation will expire on April 9.
Starting Tuesday, these officers will no longer have the power to inspect shops or issue fines, as a recent circular indicates.
Notably, the Punjab government opted not to establish affordable Ramazan bazaars in any city across the province, including Rawalpindi, citing the severe economic challenges this year. Instead, model Ramazan bazaars were introduced, yet they did not offer subsidised prices on essential items such as vegetables, fruits, flour, and groceries. Consequently, these model bazaars became hubs for price hikes, leading to a decline in customer turnout.
Over half of the stallholders at the model markets vacated their stalls within a week.
This year marked a historic failure of the affordable Ramazan bazaar system in Punjab due to the prevailing financial and economic crises. The Agricultural Fair Price Shops established by the Department of Agriculture also saw limited activity. For the past 45 years, Rawalpindi hosted 16 affordable Ramazan bazaars annually, providing 20 to 35 per cent subsidies on various items like vegetables, fruits, groceries, meat, and chicken.
However, due to the lack of subsidies, these bazaars were replaced by only three model bazaars across the district.

7,400 literacy teachers yet to receive 6-month pay,Officials claim funds aren’t available owing to financial crunch,"Around 400 female teachers of Literacy Centres in Rawalpindi district have not been paid their salaries for the last six months or so, raising fingers at the poor financial management of the PML-N government in Punjab. The picture in other districts of the province isn’t different as 14,400 teachers across the province are facing the same fate.
The non-payments have spoiled the celebrations of teachers and their families for the upcoming Eidul Fitr. These educated teachers get a mere Rs8,000 per month.
Teachers in Rawalpindi lodged a peaceful protest at the Literacy Department for the release of their salaries and submitted applications to the District Literacy Officer but none of the teachers were paid.
According to the protesting teachers, the department has been stopping their salaries for the last six months even though annual examinations have been completed and new classes have begun. They have warned of closing all literacy centres if they are not paid before Eid.
Officials in the Literacy Department claim Punjab is suffering from a severe financial crunch and the department could pay salaries as soon as the provincial government releases the funds.
The Executive Director of Parha Likha Pakistan Programme, Ejaz Hussain Shah confirmed the non-payment of salaries and said that if the government couldn’t pay salaries owing to the financial crisis, then come up with a permanent solution to this problem.
A female teacher, F Begum complains that the teachers are being humiliated in terms of wages. “The minimum wage of the Punjab government is fixed at Rs32,000 but the Literacy Department openly violates this and pays only Rs8,000 salary.”
Terming it a cruel act, she suggested an audit of the Literacy Department. Ms Begum says if the Punjab Chief Minister is a woman, she should stop this oppression of women teachers and ensure the minimum salary of Rs32,000 with timely disbursement.
“Our families have finally come across starvation in these months and are forced to break their fast with salt or water. We do not have money for kids’ shopping for Eid. Our debt has swelled.”
The teacher appealed to CM Maryam Nawaz to take immediate notice and visit any of the literacy centres to listen to the plight of women teachers.

8,Woman strangulated to death in Pindi,Victim’s brother says in-laws staged death as suicide to conceal their crime,"A woman has allegedly been strangulated to death by her inlaws in Rawalpindi. According to a spokesperson for the police, a case has been registered against her husband and sister-in-law for the murder in the Dhok Abdullah area within the limits of the Saddar Beroni police.
Initially reported as a heart attack by the in-laws, the truth emerged when marks of a noose were found on the victim's neck. Her brother, Khalilur Rehman, raised suspicions after seeing these marks at the funeral.
He stated that his sister, Asma Noreen, had been married for two years and had a six-month-old son named Arham. The family believes that her husband and sister-in-law staged her death as a suicide to conceal their crime.
The police have registered a murder case based on the brother's complaint and have begun investigations. A detailed post-mortem report is awaited to determine the exact cause of death, and efforts are underway to apprehend the suspects. Samples from the post-mortem have been sent to a forensic laboratory for analysis.
Crimes against women are high in the district like in other parts of the country. In the majority of such cases in Pakistan, the culprits go scot-free due to lax prosecution practices and out-of-court settlements.
