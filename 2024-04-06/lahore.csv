3,"Political instability keeping investors at bay, says Maryam","Stresses need to counter ‘right-wing terrorism’; blames KP govt for lack of measures to block terrorists, smugglers.","LAHORE: Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has termed political instability the cause of fear among the foreign and local investors who are afraid of investing in the country.
Speaking at her maiden Punjab apex committee meeting here on Friday, the chief minister talked about the environment of political uncertainty prevailing in the country, which, according to her, was deterring potential investors.
“Foreign and local investors are afraid of investing in Pakistan because of political instability,” she said but indirectly blamed Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) for this without naming the party.
She said on May 9, military installations were attacked, which never happened in the country before.
“A political party resorted to terrorism. What the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) could not do, a specific political party did by attacking the military installations.”

Stresses need to counter ‘right-wing terrorism’; blames KP govt for lack of measures to block terrorists, smugglers; says NAP requires upgrade

The CM talked about terrorism taking the shape of difficult warfare.
“Terrorists got digitalised and we need to be ahead of them (on such platforms). Besides, terrorists have the latest weapons and technology. They have the US weapons which they got in Afghanistan,” she said and added that the weapons being smuggled from Afghanistan were a big challenge. She also admitted that even the gangs in south Punjab “are ahead of us in technology and they have more sophisticated weapons”.
Maryam Nawaz also underlined the need to take up the challenge of countering the right-wing terrorism that was imposing its version of religion on the nation. She said the youth was also being brainwashed and recruited by terrorists.
“Social media is one of the major tools being used for this purpose,” she claimed.
The CM spoke about the effectiveness of the National Action Plan (NAP), saying there was a need to upgrade it.
“The world had recognised the effectiveness of NAP, which was formed after the APS tragedy (in 2014). Its loopholes need to be plugged.”
She expressed the government’s resolve to provide security to the Chinese nationals working on development projects in Punjab. The meeting also condemned the killing of Chinese engineers in Bisham in a terror attack and pledged to provide the Chinese nationals with the optimum security.
However, the CM said all of the Chinese here did not want to come under security discipline.
“The Chinese are resentful when they are asked to follow security protocols…They don’t want to come under any discipline. They fret over it.”
Maryam Nawaz was also critical of the KP government for not taking enough measures to check its corridors that were open to terrorists and smugglers. She alleged that the metal strong that slit open the throat of a youth in Faisalabad was also brought from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Punjab has decided to set up posts at its provincial border to stop terrorism and smuggling,” she said.
Lahore Corps Commander Lt Gen Syed Aamer Raza, other military officers, the inspector general of police, chief secretary and senior minister Marriyum Aurangzeb were also present.
The apex committees in all provinces were formed in 2015 when retired Gen Raheel Sharif was the army chief. Their main objective was said to be the coordination on security matters to implement NAP. The apex committees constitute both military and political leadership.

The Punjab Local Government and Community Development Department has moved a summary to the chief minister, seeking constitution of a committee to look into the existing local government law and update it for legislation and for holding local government elections in the province.
The local governments’ elections are due in the province for the past several years. The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had come into power in 2018 with a slogan that it would hold local government elections and devolve powers to the grassroots level, but it failed to do so despite continued assurances by the then premier, Imran Khan.
The PTI government had dissolved the local governments created under the PLGA 2013 on May 4, 2019, as it was repealed upon the promulgation of the PLGA 2019. Though the PTI government had recreated the local governments and appointed administrators on May 4, 2019 – some 30 months ahead of the completion of the LG representatives’ tenure – the Supreme Court had declared theSection 3 of the PLGA 2019 ultra vires to the Constitution. Later, the Punjab government had restored the local governments under the PLGA 2013.
By February 2022, the PTI government had claimed that it finalised the PLGA 2021 and tabled it in the Punjab Assembly, allowing the opposition (mainly the PML-N) to express its reservations as a part of democratic process. The PTI government had plans to legislate and hold direct elections to elect mayors of 11 metropolitan corporations of major cities and chairmen in the districts.
The PTI government also wanted to use Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in the local elections with a stated purpose of eliminating the age-old rigging practices in the country. However, the introduction of EVMs is still a distant dream.
ILLEGAL HOUSING SOCIETIES: The Punjab government has decided to launch a crackdown on illegal housing societies in the province.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has constituted a six-member committee comprising provincial ministers for local government and agriculture, administrative secretaries of agriculture, local government and housing departments, and senior member, Board of Revenue.

7,Four siblings poisoned to death ‘by father’ in Toba Tek Singh,"Their mother, a sister critical in hospital.","TOBA TEK SINGH: A man allegedly gave poison to his wife and all five children at Chak 520-GB on Friday, resulting in the death of his three daughters and a son, while his spouse and a daughter have been hospitalised in a critical condition.  
According to Rescue 1122, suspect Asghar’s wife Nazia Bibi told police in hospital she was admitted to after being poisoned, that she and her husband quarrelled over expenses of their household and wedding of their daughters.

8,Businesses see improved conditions despite economic challenges,"LAHORE: Business owners, largely pessimistic about the future, have started developing a better perception of their...","LAHORE: Business owners, largely pessimistic about the future, have started developing a better perception of their businesses. 
A latest Gallup survey conducted in the first quarter this year finds that 47 per cent of Pakistan’s businesses, especially those selling garments, commodities, stationery, and gift items, perceive themselves to be in better conditions. This shows a three per cent improvement over the previous quarter. The current business situation score on Gallup Business Confidence Index (GBCI) has improved by seven percentage points to 6pc in 1Q2024 from -1pc in the previous quarter, noted Gallup Pakistan Survey report.
“While economic security has not fully stabilised due to the ongoing political situation, the business situation score has improved regardless,” it said.
It said while the current business score on GBCI continued to recover for the fifth straight quarter, the future business score and direction of the country score see a reversal. About their expectations for future business conditions, the businessmen sounded pessimistic as the net future business confidence score has worsened by 16pc since last quarter and now stands at 4pc, according to the survey report. The business community’s perception about the direction the country is heading in was negative as only 20pc respondents said Pakistan was heading in the right direction. The direction of the country score has fallen to -60pc, down 13 percentage points compared to the previous quarter.
“There is an overall decline in the future business and direction of country scores” between the third quarter of 2023 and first quarter of this year, the report observed.
Like the previous survey, inflation was the most cited problem as more than two out of four businesses would want the new government to control. The proportion of those who want the government to arrest the devaluation of the rupee has also increased. 
“Political instability and taxes have taken a backseat in concern relative to the past quarter, while utility bills and business-related legislation have become more of a concern,” the report said. Asked whether business conditions during past three months induced a decrease in the workforce, three out of 10 businesses surveyed said yes. This number shows 6pc decline over the previous quarter.
Given the still backbreaking inflation and a slow economic activity in the country, businesses were asked about their sales this Ramadan and more than half of them said it had worsened. Only 18pc said they are doing better. 
Moreover, a majority, 73pc, of the businesses surveyed do not have the hope that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will address business problems. The survey reveals that while majority of businesses, 74pc, did not make such complaints some service providers and manufacturers 
said they had to pay bribes in past six months ending March to run their businesses.
About half of the businessmen, 45pc, think of the government as irrelevant for their business, while 23pc look at it as a facilitator and 33pc consider it a hurdle, according to the survey report. Despite government’s claims to have reduced loadshedding, the number of businesses braving power outages has increased by seven per cent to 45pc this quarter compared to the previous one.
“After many quarters more businesses perceive that their current situation is better than before which is a positive news, said Bilal Ijaz Gilani, executive director at Gallup Pakistan. He, however, said pessimism about the country’s economic future as well as the direction of the country has deteriorated.
Majority of businesses surveyed are not very optimistic about the new government, citing the latest survey results.
“Engagement and actively resolving business community issues should be therefore top priority of the federal and provincial governments,” said Mr Gilani.

“As far as the maintenance of plaintiff no.1 (daughter) is concerned, the defendant is paying maintenance of minor,” says a written reply on behalf of the secretary to a suit for maintenance filed by his second wife Ambreen Sardar and daughter Eiliya Noor. 
The reply, filed through Advocate Zahid Iqbal, stated that the defendant (Mengal) divorced Ambreen Sardar on June 15, 2020, and the certificate of the divorce was issued on Jan 26, 2021. 
Therefore, it argued, there was no question of payment of any maintenance to the plaintiff. 
It said the defendant had been paying maintenance allowance of Rs30,000 to Rs35,000 per month to the minor. The amount is sufficient for meeting the expense of the minor, it added. 
The home secretary also submitted documentary proof of his monthly salary of Rs460,735. 
The defendant stated that he had to meet expenses of first wife and four children as well. He said he was ready to take the custody of the minor if the plaintiff was unable to maintain her properly. 
The plaintiff’s counsel, Mian Dawood, sought time to submit proof of the source of income of the defendant and medical record of the minor for fixation of interim maintenance allowance. 
Judge Shazia Kausar adjourned the hearing till April 18 for pretrial reconciliation proceedings between the parties and fixation of the interim maintenance of the minor. 
The judge has already restrained the defendant from taking any illegal action to disturb the custody of the minor from her mother. 
Ms Sadar, who denies the claim of divorce, contended that she married Mr Mengal in 2018 and a daughter, namely Eiliya Noor, was born out of this wedlock on Nov 19, 2019. She said the minor was born in a private hospital and all expenses (Rs250,000) incurred on the delivery were paid by her. She said her relationship with her husband started getting strained after the birth of the daughter. The plaintiff asked the court to recover maintenance allowance from the defendant bureaucrat from the past years and also ordered him to regularly pay the allowance in the future.

-Dawn

 
GUJRAT: Around 100,000 residents of Jalalpur Jattan, the second largest town of Gujrat district, have to rely on the Civil Hospital, the lone public healthcare facility, which has just 20 beds and only three doctors, against the approved posts of 14 medics. 
The locals have been demanding establishment of an emergency block and a trauma centre at the Civil Hospital since long but to no avail.
The town was once known for its power looms and was called ‘mini Manchester’ for being an industrial hub. 
“Even the towns like Kunjah, Sara-i-Alamgir, Tanda and Dinga, which are smaller in population as compared to Jalalpur Jattan, have better public healthcare facilities since long,” a local social worker deplored, holding the elected representatives of the area s well as successive governments responsible for the dismal situation. 
Official sources say that only one male and two women medical officers are performing duties in the hospital, whilethere is hardly any doctor available in the night shift, and the patients  are mostly handled by the nursing staff, who usually refer them to  Gujrat DHQ hospital.
They say that the issue has been brought into the notice of the district administration time and again, but no remedial step has so far been taken to improve the situation. 
They say that the construction of the hospital’s emergency block had been launched around three years ago, but even its grey structure was lying incomplete due to the unavailability of funds. The officials mainly attribute this situation to the frequent change of the provincial governments during that period. 
They say that an old building on a piece of land adjacent to the Civil Hospital was demolished a couple of years ago for the construction of a ‘state of the art’ trauma centre approved by the Punjab government, but the work could not start on the project. 
The town residents also lamented unavailability of free medicine at the Civil Hospital in most of cases. However, they say, the needy people are helped by the patients welfare association that depends on the donations given by local philanthropists. 
They demand the Punjab government to take notice of the situation and take measures for upgrading the hospital to the THQ facility. 
Though Jalalpur Jattan had been notified as a new tehsil of Gujrat district back in 2022, it is yet to become functional as tehsil headquarters. 
Sources say the health Cheif Executive Officer Dr Zakir Rana, who visited the hospital a couple of days ago, was informed of the issues by some concerned citizens. 
Deputy Commissioner Safdar Virk told Dawn that the shortage of doctors would be overcome immediately through transfer of doctors to the Civil Hospital from nearby public healthcare facilities.
He says the provincial health authorities would be sent a reminder for the resumption of construction work of the emergency ward and trauma centre projects.

The villagers, led by lawyer Ijaz Gilani, protested in front of the DPO office, chanting slogans against the policemen and demanding action against them, as well as the recovery of the looted items described in the first information report.
KILLED: Three people shot dead a 13-year-old daughter of their rival allegedly over a land dispute in village Sandarky near Mandi Ahmadabad on Thursday night.  
According to the FIR, Muhammad Zafar had a land dispute with Atif, who, along with Amjad and another unidentified suspect, entered Zafar’s uncle Sardar Ali’s house on Thursday night and shot at Zafar, but he remained unhurt.  
Meanwhile, Atif allegedly shot Zafar’s 13-year-old daughter Mubeen Bibi, who was killed on the spot.  The alleged killers, under the cover of their weapons, managed to escape.  
A few days ago, there had been a scuffle between these suspects over the land.  
Following a report from Zafar, the Mandi Ahmadabad police registered a case under sections 302 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code and arrested Atif and Amjad.
