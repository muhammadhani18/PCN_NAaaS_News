0,CPNE calls for lifting curbs on media,Information minister says social media needs to be regulated due to its constant misuse,"In a meeting with Minister for Information Attaullah Tarar, a delegation of the Council of Pakistan Newspapers Editors (CPNE) has expressed concern over the curbs on the freedom of press and expression particularly in Balochistan province.
According to a press release issued on Friday, the delegation led by CPNE Senior Vice President Anwar Sajidi urged the newly elected government to take notice of this situation.
CPNE Secretary General Ejazul Haq noted that the media as the fourth pillar of state has been playing its role in strengthening democracy and ensuring economic progress.
The delegation assured the information minister that the media will continue to play its role in helping the newly elected government in its efforts to find a solution to the economic issues facing the country. It emphasized that restrictions imposed on the media must be lifted so that it may play its role effectively.
Minister Tarar told the delegation that the government is cognizant of the importance of the print and electronic media and wants to strengthen them.
He said the government believes in freedom of expression and press and cannot even think about imposing restrictions on the media.
However, social media, he said, has emerged as a major challenge as it is adversely affecting the morals of the new generations. ""There is a need for new rules and regulations to regulate social media,"" he said.

1,DSP among four cops martyred in K-P attacks,"Three police officials martyred in Lakki ambush, one in Bajaur IED attack","Terrorist violence continues unabated in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, especially in the regions near the border with Afghanistan, where the TTP appears to have been given a free rein by the Taliban regime. Analysts fear that the impending TTP “spring offensive” could further exasperate violence in the volatile province.
The K-P police are bearing the brunt of the terror resurge as the TTP is increasingly targeting ill-equipped policemen. In the latest attack, a senior police official and his two guards were martyred in an ambush in the southern K-P district of Lakki Marwat.
Gunmen ambushed the vehicle of DSP Gul Muhammad Khan near Manjiwala Chowk on a link road of Indus Highway with automatic weapons late Friday night, a police spokesperson told The Express Tribune. DSP Gul Muhammad and his two guards named Naseem Gul and Salamat Khan were critically injured in the assault.
The spokesperson added that DSP Khan and Constable Naseem Gul succumbed to their injuries en route to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Sarai Naurang, while Constable Salamat died while being driven to Peshawar for treatment of his life-threatening wounds.
The funeral for the martyred cops was held at Police Lines in Bannu. Bannu DPO Ziauddin, Lakki Marwat DPO Taimur Khan and other senior police and military officials attended the funeral. A police contingent presented a guard of honour to the martyrs as floral wreaths were laid on their coffins.

DSP Gul Muhammad was promoted in March 2024 and assumed his new assignment in Lakki Marwat last week. Prior to this appointment, he had served as SHO at different police stations across the district.
The security situation in K-P districts bordering Afghanistan remains extremely volatile. In Lakki Marwat, police have stopped patrolling after evening hours for over a year now for fear of TTP attacks.
In other violence, a police officer was martyred while another cop was injured in a roadside bomb blast in the Mamond tehsil of Bajaur district of K-P. “ASI Bakht Zada and Constable Ehsan were returning from Malik Shah Jehan Cricket Stadium when their vehicle hit an improvised explosive device,” SHO Zareef Khan said.
ASI Bakht Zada was martyred, while Constable Ehsan was critically injured in the blast, SHO Khan added. The injured was rushed to the District Headquarters Hospital for treatment.
The funeral of the slain ASI was held at the Police Line Bajaur. Commandant Bajaur Scouts Brigadier Mohsin Javaid, DPO Sajjad Ahmed, civil administration officials, and a large number of people attended the funeral. Later he was laid to rest with full official honours at his ancestral village.
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur condemned the deadly attacks on police and offered condolences to the families of the martyrs.
He directed the top police officials to take all necessary steps for the immediate arrest of the perpetrators. “Targeting police officials who work towards public safety is sad and condemnable,” the chief minister said in a statement, adding that police had made huge sacrifices for law and order in the province.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the attack and offered condolences to the families of martyred police officials. “The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa police have always stood like a wall against terrorism. Cowardly acts of terrorists cannot shake our resolve,” he wrote in a post on microblogging site “X”.

2,Imran likens current crisis to 1971 debacle,Says erosion of democratic mandate mirrors events of East Pakistan,"PTI founder and former premier Imran Khan on Saturday likened the prevailing “erosion of democratic mandate” to the tumultuous events in erstwhile East Pakistan.
Drawing parallels to the historical debacle in erstwhile East Pakistan, Imran lamented the purported hijacking of his party's mandate.
The founder of PTI made the remarks during an informal conversation with journalists during the hearing of the Toshakhana (gift repository) reference in Adiala jail.
He claimed that the real value of the jewellery set was Rs18 million and not what was claimed in the reference.
Imran also claimed that when he was arrested, police officials seized his passport and chequebook from his bedroom and alleged that it was an intelligence agency which enlisted an employee of Toshakhana and Inam Shah as witnesses in the reference
Citing the involvement of a part-time salesman in Dubai, Imran alleged that he was the one who estimated the value of the Graff jewellery set that implicated him in the Toshakhana case.
The former PM also expressed his intent to file a case against the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman and Inam Shah for their roles in the Toshakhana reference and asserted that the incumbent army chief targeted his wife to undermine him in the reference.
""Fawad Chaudhry held a press conference, yet he was still coerced into becoming a witness. If Pervez Elahi and Shah Mehmood Qureshi hold a press conference today, all their cases will vanish,"" Imran claimed.
Imran also talked about an alleged assassination plot against him at the judicial complex on March 18, indicating that the complex was overtaken by numerous individuals in plain clothes 24 hours prior to his arrival.
""Why is the CCTV footage of the judicial complex not being brought forward?""
The former premier asserted that the 'London plan' was orchestrated between General Asim and Nawaz Sharif and indicated the involvement of judges in its execution.
""Mujeebur Rahman's majority would have ended Yahya Khan's power,"" he emphasized that the plan resulted in the ""theft"" of the country's mandate, drawing parallels to historical events in East Pakistan.
Imran referred to Mujib's election victory as documented in the Hamudur Rahman commission report and alleged that currently there are ongoing attempts to steal the nation's democratic mandate.
""The king is sitting back and Mohsin Naqvi has become the viceroy. Shahbaz Sharif is cutting ribbons but he has no power. The country's economy is sinking.""
""On the other hand, judges are saying that the agencies are threatening them and there is lawlessness in the country,"" Imran added.
Imran asserted that Asif Zardari's accusation regarding a 'political party tarnishing the army's image' contrasted with the PTI's previous high regard for the army.
""We were informed by the ISI and General Bajwa about corruption within the Sharif family, including the acquisition of cars from Toshakhana. Why haven't their case been pursued?""
""The entire nation is aware that Asim Munir is wielding significant control over the country."" He recounted prior communications, stating, ""Before General Asim Munir's appointment, I conveyed through Arif Alvi that we harboured no animosity towards him. I contacted Asim Munir via Arif Alvi, who assured me of his awareness regarding the 'London plan.' Ali Zaidi also relayed a message, urging neutrality for the country's stability.""
""I firmly believe that death is preferable to servitude.""
Read Imran predicts 'Sri Lanka-like debacle'
Responding to inquiries about expectations of justice from Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Imran said, ""The nation observes closely, and I refrain from commenting. Today, the country has transformed, and people are becoming more aware. We were labelled as traitors, ensnared in the events of May 9. The results of February 8 revealed where the nation stands.""
Regarding alleged judicial involvement in the 'London plan,' Imran acknowledged, ""Many judges, Mohsin Naqvi, chief election commissioner, and the caretaker government were implicated. Despite our grievances, we didn't resort to confrontation with the army."" He added,
""Although General Bajwa's actions felt like a betrayal, we refrained from convening a committee to confront him.""
When questioned about Bushra Bibi being 'poisoned', Imran Khan responded, ""Until Bushra Bibi undergoes an endoscopy, it's premature to ascertain anything. When something is ingested, mere observation may not reveal the full extent of the situation.""
""Rising inflation may spell the demise of the PML-N. The ruling elite, indifferent to domestic affairs, stash their wealth abroad,"" said the former prime minister and appreciated the integrity shown by the six IHC judges.
He added that the judiciary should uphold the rule of law, as investors are unlikely to commit capital to a nation where judicial authorities are under threat.
When questioned about the restructuring of party committees, Imran clarified, ""The committees primarily handle routine political affairs, with the core committee vested with final decision-making authority.""

3,PM grants bonuses amid financial woes,Hints at initiating reward programme for high-performing bureaucrats by making a 100% raise in salaries,"Just days before leaving for Washington to request the International Monetary Fund for a new bailout package to avoid a default, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has approved four salaries in reward for officers working in the Prime Minister’s office.
The decision belies the claim of austerity and is tantamount to rubbing salt into the wounds of people bearing 27% hike in overall prices and multiple increases in their utility bills.
The honorariums have been approved for the officers for making extra efforts in completion of the official tasks, said the sources. The government approved the rewards just after one month in office.
The sources said that no extraordinary job has been completed by these officers that could have made them eligible for such rewards.
The rewards will be paid by taking loans from the banks at 23% interest rate.
Last week, the prime minister said every cup of tea that is offered in his office is also bought with borrowed money. Yet, he not only approved the proposal to give up to four salaries in reward but also asked his finance minister to concur with it.
The Prime Minister Office’s employees are already getting higher than the standard pay packages.
The finance minister also approved two salaries in reward to the officials of the PM’s office - from grade-1 to -16 - taking their total reward to five salaries in just two months, according to the sources.
Former prime minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar had also granted three salaries in reward to the employees of the PM Office. Aurangzeb took these decisions as the chairman of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet.
The Express Tribune requested the finance minister for his comments on the development. He was also asked whether his action would bode well for a government that is going to request the IMF for another bailout package to avoid the sovereign default.
The minister did not respond till the filing of the story.
Aurangzeb and Secretary Finance Imdad Ullah Bosal are set to depart for Washington to attend the Spring Meetings of the IMF and also formally request the IMF management for a new bailout package.
Pakistan remains afloat only because of dole-outs by regional countries, the IMF, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the domestic commercial banks.
The country is adding on an average Rs48 billion per day in its already unsustainable debt pile. This debt consumes Rs8.5 trillion per annum in interest payments –equal to 90% of the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) tax collection.
The decisions of generously giving rewards to the bureaucrats indicate a lack of appreciation of the grave economic situation.
The doling out of honorariums is also contrary to the austerity policy announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during his second cabinet meeting.
The sources said a proposal for offering additional salaries had been initiated by the PM’s Office and was first approved by Shehbaz himself.
They said the PM approved a fresh one-month salary in honorarium for his grade-17 to -21 officers.
Shehbaz Sharif also restored three salaries in honorariums for the officers, which the former caretaker PM first approved and then withheld after The Express Tribune approached the PM office for a version.
The secretary to the PM did not respond to a request for comments.
In his capacity as ECC chairman, the finance minister gave approval to grant four salaries in honorariums to grade-17 to -21 officers, including three that were restored by the PM. The total impact of the fresh decision would be around Rs51 million, said the sources.
The ECC chairman also gave two salaries as reward to grade-1 to -16 officials of the PM Office. Earlier, the former PM had given three salaries to all the officials (from grade-1 to -16) as a departing gift, which cost another Rs51 million. This brings the total honorarium awarded to the officials of the PM’s Office to five salaries.
The federal government’s budget deficit widened more than 50% during the first half of this fiscal year, requiring prudent fiscal management and leaving no room for any kind of rewards.
Compared to the private sector, the low-paid employees are getting higher salaries and enjoying job security. In the first half, the federal government’s total expenditures surged by 58% compared to the same period of the previous year.
The total expenses amounted to Rs6.7 trillion – higher by Rs2.5 trillion. There was also a 50% increase in the current expenditures that amounted to Rs6.6 trillion in six months.
Reward programme
According to sources, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif in a recent meeting of his cabinet indicated initiating a “reward programme” for high-performer bureaucrats in ministries by making a 100 per cent increase in salaries.
The PM appreciated the role of proactive secretaries heading divisions for their depth of sector-specific knowledge and professional calibres.
He said high performers would get suitable rewards while the underperformers would be answerable for their inefficiency. The premier urged civil servants to do away with the attitude of red-tapism and to work on simplifying processes.
The role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) was applauded in this regard, which he said provided a robust mechanism to address hurdles in implementation effectively and to facilitate the ease of doing business.
The premier also observed that there was too much emphasis on paperwork-driven processes in the ministries and that out-of-the-box problem resolution was only marginal.
He emphasized the need to develop mechanisms that encouraged creative thinking to achieve targets and new tools and strategies focused on outcomes. Automation across all Government departments was also stressed.

4,Five officials to be punished over Bisham attack,Minister says PM’s orders came after Shangla inquiry found them guilty of negligence,"Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered action against five officials over their “negligence” in light of an inquiry report on the suicide attack on March 26 in which six people, including five Chinese engineers, working on the Dasu Hydropower Project lost their lives in the Bisham area of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla district.
Addressing a news conference in Lahore, Tarar said the premier had directed to take disciplinary action within 15 days against the Hazara Division regional police officer; Upper Kohistan district police officer (DPO), Lower Kohistan DPO, security director for the Dasu Hydropower Project and commandant of the K-P Special Security Unit.
“The inquiry report found that these security officials were negligent in their duties and should have remained alert on the day of the [attack],” he added.
The minister explained that the action being taken on the inquiry report was an example for taking the security of Chinese nationals more seriously in the future and no lapse would be tolerated in this connection.
Tarar said Pakistan wanted peace in the region but its desire should not be misconstrued as a weakness.
“We are taking the matter of the security of the Chinese nationals very seriously. The prime minister is personally overseeing the security of the Chinese projects and engineers.”

The minister continued that an effective system was being chalked out for this purpose.
“We pay homage to all those who sacrificed their lives in war against terrorism.”
In response to the Chinese government’s demand to immediately investigate the attack and bring the perpetrators to justice, the government formed a joint investigation team to probe into the incident.
The minister said Pakistan valued its friendly ties with China.
He pointed out that after the attack, PM Shehbaz immediately went to the Chinese embassy and met with its envoy.
He added that the premier also personally visited Dasu to boost the morale of the Chinese engineers and offered his condolences to them.
In a related development, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi ordered foolproof security steps for the Chinese nationals in the country.
According to a news statement issued by his ministry, Naqvi issued these orders while presiding over a meeting in Islamabad on the security arrangements for Chinese citizens.
He emphasised the protection of foreigners, especially Chinese citizens, in Pakistan “at all costs”.
The minister directed the implementation of standard operating procedures for the security of foreigners, particularly Chinese nationals.
“The enemies of the state do not want Pakistan to prosper, but they are mistaken. We will not let the nefarious motives of the miscreants be successful,” the statement quoted him as telling the huddle’s participants, who included Interior Secretary Khurram Agha and other senior officials of the ministry.
The attack had forced Power China and the China Gezhouba Company to suspend work on two dam projects.
Hundreds of Chinese people are employed at the Dasu and Diamer Bhasha dam construction sites. Operations by Power China have resumed at Diamer Bhasha. However, the China Gezhouba Group Company’s operations at Dasu remain suspended.

5,Pakistan slams Indian defence minister’s war talk,"Brands minister's statement as 'admission of guilt', warns of 'befitting response' to any misadventure","Pakistan strongly condemned on Saturday the ""provocative"" comments made by Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh during a televised interview, branding them as an ""admission of guilt.""
Islamabad issued a stern warning to New Delhi, cautioning of a befitting response should there be any misadventure against the country.Singh, in an interview with broadcaster CNN News18, declared India's readiness to cross into Pakistani territory to eliminate individuals attempting to flee after engaging in terrorist activities within India.
He stated, ""If they run away to Pakistan, we will enter Pakistan to kill them.
""The Indian defence minister's remarks came hot on the heels of The Guardian's damning investigative report, revealing the involvement of India's intelligence agency RAW in orchestrating the murders of at least 20 individuals in Pakistan since 2020.
The report drew upon insights from intelligence officials from both nations and documents shared by Pakistani investigators.
In a statement on Saturday, the Foreign Office said that Pakistan stood resolute in its intent and ability to safeguard its sovereignty against any aggression and that the international community should hold India accountable for its heinous and illegal actions.
“India’s assertion of its preparedness to extra-judiciously execute more civilians, arbitrarily pronounced as ‘terrorists’, inside Pakistan constitutes a clear admission of culpability,” the FO said.
“It is imperative for the international community to hold India accountable for its heinous and illegal actions.”
The statement added that on January 25, Pakistan provided irrefutable evidence of Indian extrajudicial killings and transnational assassinations on Pakistani soil.
It further recalled that in Feb 2019, India received a strong response to aggression and that the move exposed New Delhi's hollow claims of military superiority.“Indian rulers are resorting to hateful rhetoric for electoral gains and this irresponsible behaviour harms regional peace,” the FO said.“Pakistan has always demonstrated its commitment to peace in the region.
However, our desire for peace should not be misconstrued. History attests to Pakistan’s firm resolve and ability to protect and defend itself,” the FO statement said in conclusion.
On Feb 26, 2019, Indian planes violated Pakistani airspace and conducted air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Responding to the Indian aggression the next day, the Pakistan Air Force shot down two Indian fighter jets and captured Indian pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman. Later, the government decided to release the pilot as a peace gesture.
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned India of a tit-for-tat response, saying New Delhi will have to bear the consequences in case it resorted to any aggression against Islamabad.
Read Pakistanis ‘fed up’ with India rivalry
Asif noted that the fiery rhetoric by Indian ministers these days was merely tactics employed for electioneering in the country. “India's anti-Pakistani statements are aimed at gaining attention from the public.”He stated that India was sponsoring terror activities both inside Pakistan and abroad.
He urged India to exercise caution in making such statements and refrain from taking any actions during the election period that could lead to unfavourable consequences.
In a pun, the defence minister said the return of Indian pilot was an “act of charity”.The Foreign Office, in an earlier statement on Friday, stated that the Indian network of extra-judicial and extra-territorial killings was now a “global phenomenon” and warned that India’s assassination of the Pakistanis on Pakistani soil was a clear violation of the country’s sovereignty and a breach of the UN Charter.
The statement highlighted a news conference by Foreign Secretary Syrus Sajjad Qazi in January, in which he had said that there was “credible evidence” of links between Indian agents and the assassination of two Pakistani nationals in Sialkot and Rawalakot.“These cases exposed the increasing sophistication and brazenness of Indian-sponsored terrorist acts inside Pakistan, with striking similarities to the pattern observed in other countries, including Canada and the United States,” the FO said.“It is critical to bring to justice the perpetrators, facilitators, financiers and sponsors of these extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings. India must be held accountable internationally for its blatant violation of international law,” the Foreign Office added.
