0,Tel Aviv to allow ‘temporary’ aid shipments into Gaza,"Move comes after US warned of sharp policy shift over deaths of civilians, aid workers.","GAZA STRIP: Israel announced on Friday that it would allow “temporary” aid deliveries into famine-threatened northern Gaza, hours after the United States warned of a sharp shift in its policy over Israel’s war against Hamas.
Germany on Friday said Israel had “no more excuses” to delay the entry of aid, after nearly six months of war.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza reported at least 54 more people killed in Israeli strikes over the previous day.
In a tense, 30-minute phone call on Thursday, US President Joe Biden told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that United States policy on Israel was dependent on the protection of civilians and aid workers in Gaza, the first hint of possible conditions to Washington’s military support.

Move comes after US warned of sharp policy shift over deaths of civilians, aid workers

Just hours later, overnight in Jerusalem, Israel announced it would open more aid routes into the coastal Palestinian territory which Israel placed under siege at the start of the war nearly six months ago.
“Israel will allow the temporary delivery of humanitarian aid” through the Ashdod Port and the Erez land crossing, as well as increased deliveries from neighbouring Jordan at the Kerem Shalom crossing, Netanyahu’s office said.
Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 33,091 people, according to the health ministry in Gaza, while the United Nations has warned of “catastrophic” hunger.
‘Unacceptable’
Palestinians in northern Gaza have eaten an average of just 245 calories per day — less than a can of beans — since January, according to the charity Oxfam.
Charities have accused Israel of blocking aid, but Israel had defended its efforts and blamed shortages on groups’ inability to distribute aid once it gets in.
The dangerous work of trying to stem a famine was underscored this week by an Israeli strike that killed seven humanitarian workers — an Australian, Britons, a North American, a Palestinian and a Pole.
Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong told Britain’s The Guardian newspaper, in comments published on Friday, that Netanyahu’s initial comment on the deaths was “deeply insensitive”.
The Israeli leader had said: “It happens in war.” He said the killings were unintentional and pledged an investigation “right to the end”.
Wong said Australia does “not accept any suggestion that this is just something that can be brushed aside as just something that happens in war”.
In his call with Netanyahu, Biden “made clear that US policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel’s immediate action” to improve the humanitarian situation, according to a White House summary.
Allies have been pressing Biden to leverage the billions of dollars in military aid sent by Washington.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, writing on social media platform X, said the people of Gaza “need every aid package now… We expect the Israeli government to implement its announcements quickly”.
 






US top diplomat Antony Blinken told reporters after the leaders’ phone call that “if we don’t see the changes that we need to see, there’ll be changes in our own policy”. He did not elaborate.
Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin said the deadly strike on the World Central Kitchen staff had “reinforced the expressed concern over a potential Israeli military operation in Rafah”, Gaza’s southern city.
‘No rules’
Relentless Israeli bombardment has reduced much of Gaza to rubble, collapsed the hospital system and spawned a humanitarian crisis, with all of the 2.4 million Palestinians “experiencing acute food insecurity and malnutrition,” a World Bank report said on Tuesday.
Despite the dire need, relief work has become almost impossible in Gaza, major international aid groups, including Oxfam and Save the Children, said after Israel killed the World Central Kitchen staff.
Spanish NGO Open Arms, which along with World Central Kitchen was working to establish a maritime aid corridor, announced it was suspending operations after the strike.

1,Blinken says US wants to strengthen ties with Pakistan,WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday and reiterated the...,"WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday and reiterated the commitment to strengthening the partnership between the United States and Pakistan, the State Department said. 
In a statement issued in Washington, the department’s spokesperson Matthew Miller said Secretary Blinken “reaffirmed our commitment to a robust partnership between the United States and Pakistan that advances the prosperity of both nations”. 
Secretary Blinken, he said, also “stressed the importance of continued cooperation on counterterrorism, expanding our trade and investment partnership, and advancing women’s economic security and empowerment”. 
As the statement indicates, central to this commitment is the prioritisation of cooperation in counterterrorism efforts, trade, and investment expansion. 
Pakistan faces a serious threat from terrorist groups based in Afgha­nistan, like the TTP, and at a recent briefing Mr Miller made it clear that the United States did not want Afghanistan to allow terrorists to carry out cross-border attacks from its soil. 
He also expressed the desire to further expand the counterterrorism partnership between the two countries. 
Last week, US President Joe Biden also emphasised the need for strengthening the US-Pakistan partnership in a message he sent to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. 
The conversation bet­ween the top diplomats of the two countries was the first since Ishaq Dar took the oath as new foreign minister. 
A notable aspect of the discussion was the focus on advancing women’s economic security and empowerment. Secretary Blinken stressed the impor­tance of gender equality in fostering inclusive economic growth.

2,FO avoids comment on report of Indian role in assassinations,Says official responses are not issued on media reports,"ISLAMABAD: A day after the UK newspaper, The Guardian, reported the Indian government’s involvement in assassinating individuals in Pakistan, the Foreign Office said on Friday it does not make official statements on media reports.
When journalists approached the FO for a response to the report, they were referred to past comments made by Foreign Secretary Syrus Sajjad Qazi and Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch on the issue.
At a press conference on Jan 25, Mr Qazi presented “credible evidence” of India’s orchestrated assassinations of two citizens last year inside Pakistan.
He had described Indian operations as sophisticated and multi-jurisdictional, involving the recruitment and financing of a diverse array of participants, including criminals, terrorists, and unsuspecting civilians. 

Says official responses are not issued on media reports

The foreign secretary mentioned that although there were numerous instances where Indian involvement was under suspicion, he was particularly presenting two cases where Indian involvement had been definitively confirmed.
In her remarks on Feb 1, Spoke­sperson Baloch said the Indian network of extra-judicial and extra-territorial killings was “a global phenomenon requiring a coordinated international response”.
She said India must be held accountable internationally for its “blatant violation of international law”.
The Guardian’s report, published on Thursday, cited intelligence officials from both countries and documents shared by Pakistani investigators. It said India’s foreign intelligence agency “allegedly began to carry out assassinations abroad as part of an emboldened approach to national security after 2019”.
India has rejected the claims.
The report added that while India has previously been unofficially linked to the deaths, this was the first time “Indian intelligence personnel have discussed the alleged operations in Pakistan, and detailed documentation has alleged Research Analysis Wing’s (RAW) direct involvement in the assassinations”.
The report, quoting Pakistani investigators, said these killings were orchestrated by Indian intelligence sleeper cells “mostly operating out of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)”.

3,UK rail services hit by drivers’ strike,Five main train operating companies due to be hit by the first day of the latest Aslef strike.,"LONDON: Rail services were hit to large parts of the UK, including key tourist routes, as train drivers launched a new strike amid cost-of-living pressures and decades-high inflation. 
Members of the Aslef union representing train drivers are taking part in a three-day rolling strike which will also affect express services to London’s Gatwick, Stansted and Heathrow airports. 
Union chief Mick Whelan blamed the industrial action on the “cost of living crisis created by the economic ineptitude of the Tories (Conservatives) that have been in power for 14 years”. 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to call a general election later this year with current opinion polls putting his government on course for a drubbing at the hands of Keir Starmer’s main opposition Labour party. 
Workers across the economy from doctors and nurses to lawyers, teachers and dock workers have taken strike action for pay hikes. 
Five main train operating companies were due to be hit by the first day of the latest Aslef strike. 
More train drivers at different companies would walk out on Saturday and again on Monday with overtime bans also being implemented. 
Last November members of the RMT rail union, which represents various types of rail workers, voted in favour of a pay deal that ended more than a year of walkouts.

4,In-person classes in Philippine schools suspended due to heat,"Many schools have no air-conditioning, leaving students to swelter in crowded, poorly ventilated classrooms.","MANILA: Thousands of schools in the Philippines suspended in-person classes on Friday, the education department said, as parts of the tropical country endured dangerously high temperatures.
The months of March, April and May are typically the hottest and driest in the archipelago nation, but conditions this year have been exacerbated by the El Nino weather phenomenon.
Many schools have no air-conditioning, leaving students to swelter in crowded, poorly ventilated classrooms.
“Even my smartest student is not in the mood to answer questions because it’s very hot,” said Mayette Paulino, who teaches a grade two class of around 27 children near Manila.
She said “students feel tired and seem sleepy” as the heat intensified in the afternoon.
The Department of Education, which oversees more than 47,000 schools nationwide, has issued an advisory giving school heads the power to decide when to switch to remote learning “in cases of extreme heat and other calamities”.
Official figures for Friday showed 5,288 schools had suspended in-person classes, affecting more than 3.6 million students, after 4,769 schools on Thursday.
Nearly 300 schools in Manila alone had remote learning on Friday, while the central regions of the main island of Luzon were the hardest hit, with more than 1,600 schools suspending in-person classes.
Some schools have reduced class hours to avoid teaching during the hottest times of the day.
The heat index was expected to reach the “danger” level of 42 or 43 degrees Celsius in several areas of the country on Friday, the state weather forecaster said.
In Manila, the heat index was forecast to hit the “extreme caution” level of up to 40C (104F), when heat cramps and exhaustion are possible.
The country’s heat index measures what a temperature feels like, taking into account humidity.

5,"4.8-magnitude quake hits New York, New Jersey","NEW YORK: A 4.8-magnitude earthquake struck near New York City on Friday morning, the US Geological Survey said,...","NEW YORK: A 4.8-magnitude earthquake struck near New York City on Friday morning, the US Geological Survey said, shaking buildings up and down the east coast and surprising residents in an area that rarely experiences notable seismic activity.
The quake’s epicenter was in Tewksbury, central New Jersey, 64 kilometres west of New York City. It occurred just after 10.20am ET (1420 GMT) at a depth of 4.7 kilometres, the USGS said.
No major damage was reported, but New York Governor Kathy Hochul warned of the possibility of aftershocks at a news conference. Engineering teams are inspecting roads and bridges.
“This is one of the largest earthquakes on the east coast in the last century,” she said.
New York City Mayor Eric Adams said at a news conference that no injuries had been reported, but urged city residents to take cover under furniture, in a doorway or next to an interior wall if they feel any aftershocks.
“New Yorkers should go about their normal day,” he said.
People from Baltimore to Boston reported feeling rumbling and shaking, with some running outside to try to detect the source.
Charita Walcott, a 38-year-old resident in the Bronx borough of New York, said the quake felt “like a violent rumble that lasted about 30 seconds or so”.   
“It was kind of like being in a drum circle, that vibration,” she said.
James Pittinger, mayor of Lebanon, New Jersey, near the quake’s epicenter, said there were no reports of injuries or significant damage but that people were unnerved.
“I was sitting in my home office when things started to fall off the walls and shelves,” Pittinger said. “It was a crazy experience.” 
President Joe Biden spoke with New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy about the earthquake, and the administration will provide assistance if needed, the White House said in a statement.
At the United Nations in midtown Manhattan, the Save the Children CEO abruptly stopped addressing the Security Council on the Gaza crisis as cameras began shuddering.
“You’re making the ground shake,” Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour quipped.
Flights were held at area airports in the aftermath of the earthquake, but resumed after two hours, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Residual delays were expected.
Friday’s tremor was the largest felt in the city since the 2011 5.8-magnitude earthquake in Virginia that prompted evacuations of the city hall and other buildings and caused damage in Washington.
Earthquake magnitudes are measured on a logarithmic scale, which means the amount of energy released by a quake increases by more than 30 times for each whole number.
The 1989 earthquake that disrupted baseball’s World Series and rocked San Francisco was measured at a 6.9 magnitude, which would have made it more than 1,000 times more powerful than Friday’s quake.
Earthquakes in the eastern US are felt across a far broader area because the bedrock is much older and harder, transferring seismic energy more easily, according to the USGS. The rocks in the western US are younger and contain more faults that absorb earthquake energy.

6,"Taiwan rescuers face threat of landslides, rockfalls",Quake death toll rises to 12; about 50 aftershocks reported,"

HUALIEN: Rescuers in Taiwan faced the threat of further landslides and rockfalls in Friday’s search for a dozen people still missing from this week’s earthquake, as the death toll rose to 12 while some of those stranded were brought to safety.
Searchers discovered two more bodies after Wednesday’s quake of magnitude 7.2 struck the sparsely populated, largely rural eastern county of Hualien, stranding hundreds in a national park as boulders barrelled down mountains, cutting off roads.
About 50 aftershocks rattled the area overnight, some felt as far away as Taipei. Rescuers said about 400 people cut off in a luxury hotel in the Taroko Gorge national park were safe, with helicopters ferrying out the injured and bringing supplies.
“Rain increases the risks of rockfalls and landslides, which are currently the biggest challenges,” said Su Yu-ming, the leader of a search team helping the rescue effort, pointing to expectations for rain.

Quake death toll rises to 12; about 50 aftershocks reported

“These factors are unpredictable, which means we cannot confirm the number of days required for the search and rescue operations.” Taiwan’s fire department said two bodies were found in the mountains, but wanted to confirm their identities before updating the death toll.
It put the number of missing at 13, three of them foreigners of Australian and Canadian nationality.
Aid supplies are arriving at the scene, while senior politicians such as President Tsai Ing-wen said they were donating a month’s salary to relief efforts.
Japan will provide $1 million in aid to Taiwan for rescue and recovery effort, its foreign minister, Yoko Kamikawa, said.
Hotel workers found
A group of 50 hotel workers marooned on a road to the national park are now mostly safe.
“I am lucky to survive,” said David Chen, 63, a security manager at the hotel, after his rescue. “We were terrified when the earthquake first happened. We thought it was all over, all over, all over, because it was an earthquake, right?” Rocks were still tumbling down nearby slopes as the group left, he added. 
“We had to navigate through the gaps between the falling rocks, with the rescue team out front.” Chen’s 85-year-old mother wept in relief on being reunited with her son, as the family had not known for some time if he had survived.
“I was happy when he returned,” said the mother, Chen Lan-chih. “I didn’t sleep at all last night and couldn’t eat anything.” 
The quake came a day before Taiwan began a long weekend holiday for the traditional tomb sweeping festival, when people head to their homes to spruce up ancestral graves.
Many others visit tourist spots, like Hualien, famed for its rugged beauty, but the earthquake has crushed business, with many bookings cancelled, some businesses said.
“This is a disaster actually for us because no matter (whether) hotel, hostel, restaurants (everything) really depends on tourism,” said hostel owner Aga Syu, adding that her main concern was the well-being of guests.
“I hope this won’t destroy their image of Hualien.” Taiwan lies near the junction of two tectonic plates and is prone to earthquakes. More than 100 people were killed in a 2016 quake in its south, while one of magnitude 7.3 killed more than 2,000 in 1999.
