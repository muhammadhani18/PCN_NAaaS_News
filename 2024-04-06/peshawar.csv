0,Construction of commercial building begins at site of Khyber temple,Officials insist land records have no mention of mandir in Landi Kotal Bazaar.,"KHYBER: Construction of a commercial building has begun at the site of a historical temple in Landi Kotal Bazaar here after the demolition of the Hindu place of worship closed since the country’s independence in 1947.
The development comes as the district administration expresses ignorance about the temple’s demolition.
Located in the centre of the Landi Kotal bazaar, the temple was closed in 1947 after the local Hindu families migrated to India.
It was partially damaged by some clerics and seminarians in 1992 following the demolition of the 16th century Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, India, by Hindu fanatics.

Officials insist land records have no mention of mandir in Landi Kotal Bazaar

Authorities find no “illegality” in the approval of the construction of a commercial building at the temple’s site and insist that there was no mention of a “mandir” at that site in official records.
When asked by Dawn on Thursday evening, workers at the site refused to name the builder(s).
Landi Kotal assistant commissioner Irshad Mohmand claimed the land in the entire Landi Kotal Bazaar was owned by the state, but there was no mention of the Hindu temple in the old land revenue records.
He told Dawn that a no objection certificate was issued to the builder for the renovation and repair of some old shops in front of the temple.
His staff members told Dawn that it was the responsibility of the auqaf department to maintain and preserve historical non-Muslim places of worship, but the department had no office or employees in Khyber tribal districts.
They added that the tehsil municipal authorities granted permission to put up commercial buildings or shops at all commercial and trade centres in tribal districts.
Tehsil municipal officer Shahbaz Khan, who took charge of his office on Friday, told Dawn that the local government was authorised to give the go-ahead for the construction of all commercial structures in the area only after their maps or drawings were approved and the requisite fees were deposited.
He said that approval was granted only after all conditions set by the TMA were fulfilled, which included the site visit by the engineer, the production of a report by patwari, tehsildar and the building inspector, and its thorough examination to see if the applicant possessed original ownership documents.
“We do not have authentic and organised revenue records—a hurdle to the approval of the construction of commercial buildings,” he said.
The TMO also said a notice was served on the owner of the plaza that was under construction.
“Our notice was received by some workers at the construction site, but they refused to disclose the identity of their employer,” he said.
Abdus Samad, the former TMO during whose tenure in the office, the deal for the construction of a commercial building was struck, expressed complete ignorance about any such orders issued by his office.
He, however, said it was the responsibility of the building inspector and engineer of the TMA to first pay a visit to the site and then approve the map or drawing of the new building after learning about the ownership of the site that was duly okayed by the local tehsildar and patwari.
Landi Kotal patwari Jamal Afridi claimed he was not aware of the construction activity at the temple’s site. He added that the revenue records had no mention of a mandir at that site. Tehsildar Taimur Afridi wasn’t available for comments.
Leaders of religious minorities resented the temple’s demolition, saying the act would deal a blow to the cause of interfaith harmony and tolerance towards non-Muslims.
Haroon Sarabdiyal of the Pakistan Hindu Mandir Management Committee insisted that it was the responsibility of the district administration and relevant government departments to ensure the protection and rehabilitation of historical buildings of religious importance to non-Muslims.
He said the archeology and museums department, police, culture department, and local government were bound by the 2016 antiquity law to protect such sites, including places of worship.
“If the government fails to fulfil its obligations towards religious minorities, all their places of worship and other historical buildings will vanish soon,” he said.
Mr Sarabdiyal suggested that the places, which were either not used by minorities or in a dilapidated condition, could be utilised for any social welfare activity to the collective benefit of the local communities.

“Our ultimate goal is to develop this important department along modern lines. All possible steps will be taken for it,” Mr Gandapur told a meeting of the excise and taxation department at the Chief Minister’s House.
The CM ordered officials to determine the role and responsibilities of the proposed directorates, according to an official statement issued from the Chief Minister’s Secretariat on Friday.
He also said necessary amendments should be made to the relevant legal framework for enhancing revenue collection by the department.

Says excise dept’s vehicles used by unauthorised people should be withdrawn

Mr Gandapur said the excise department’s vehicles being used by unauthorised people should be withdrawn, and notices should be served on all of them.
“Legal action will be taken against those who fail to return those vehicles within the stipulated time,” he said.
The CM ordered the documentation of all “authorised” people with official vehicles.
He said those vehicles would be handed over to police and other provincial departments on a need basis.
Mr Gandapur said defective and useless vehicles, currently parked at the warehouse of the excise department, should be auctioned in a transparent manner and that the vehicles should not be handed over to anyone on political recommendations.
He ordered the introduction of a “viable mechanism” for collecting commercial tax on residential rented properties and said the excise department should come up with a geographical information system to ensure property tax collection in a more efficient and transparent manner.
“We need to work hard with a concerted and result-oriented approach in order to expand our tax net,” he said.
The CM ordered authorities to take the necessary steps to strengthen the performance assessment mechanism within the department.
He said officials with good performance should be encouraged, whereas those neglecting their professional obligations should be held accountable.
Meanwhile, the provincial cabinet on Friday approved the provision of Rs859.8 million supplementary grant to tehsil municipal administrations in the settled and merged tribal districts of the province for their salary and pension expenses and liabilities.
The funds will be provided to TMAs in 86 settled and 25 merged districts, according to an official statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Secretariat.

He made this statement during a meeting at the health department. 
He said under the policy, pharmacy services would be integrated with the health centres. He said doctors would prescribe medications based on formulas rather than brands for patients, aiming to eliminate price manipulation and supply constraints from the drug market.
“Implementation of the policy is expected to reduce medication expenses for patients. Hospital pharmacist appointments under the policy will ensure the availability of standard medications at lower rates for the public,” he said.
Additionally, Mr Ali said assistance would be provided to reduce the harmful effects of medications through pharmaceutical vigilance and antimicrobial resistance in hospitals.
“A drug information and poison control centre will be established to provide guidance on poisoning and medication overdoses. “Establishment of a drug testing laboratory at the divisional level is also proposed in the policy, along with the recommendation for the appointment of a drug inspector at the district level,” the minister said.

5,Govt withdraws challenge to ATC orders for release of PTI leader,MNA Ali Mohammad was held over May 9 violence in Mardan,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Friday withdrew from the Peshawar High Court its petition against the orders of an anti-terrorism court for the release of PTI central leader and MNA Mohammad Ali Khan in a May 9 violence case registered by Mardan police. 
A bench consisting of Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Syed Arshad Ali disposed of the petition after provincial advocate general Shah Faisal Uthmankhel submitted an application to it for the withdrawal of the government’s plea. 
The AG said Mr Ali Mohammad was arrested in a case registered in connection with the May 9 violence protests in Mardan district. 
He added that Mardan’s ATC had ordered the immediate release of the PTI leader after “discharging” him from the case on June 9, 2023, due to a lack of any evidence against him. 

MNA Ali Mohammad was held over May 9 violence in Mardan

The AG said the then caretaker government had challenged the orders of the ATC in the high court. 
He contended that the current elected government had decided to withdraw its plea after finding no evidence against Mr Ali Mohammad in the case. 
Mr Ali Mohammad was repeatedly arrested by the police and anti-corruption establishment. 
He remained in detention for around 80 days before being freed on July 27, 2023. 
While issuing orders for his release, the ATC judge observed that the records revealed that the accused was not directly charged for offences mentioned in the FIR and was charged on the basis of hearsay. 
“On the record, there is no direct or circumstantial evidence that could connect the said accused with the commission of the offence,” he had ruled. 
The judge also noted that despite having already spent a significant amount of time in police custody, no incriminating evidence implicating him in the incident had been presented. 
During the preliminary hearing into the petition last year, an additional advocate general argued that the counter terrorism department had arrested the accused and produced him before the ATC seeking his physical remand, but the court, instead of remanding him into the custody of the CTD, had discharged him in the case. 
He had requested the court to set aside the ATC’s verdict and order the arrest of the accused. 
However, after the present government was installed, it decided to withdraw its plea. 
ECL CASE: The bench also ordered authorities to remove the names of PTI leaders and MNAs Junaid Akbar and Mujahid Ali Khan from the Exit Control List and Provisional National Identification List. 
It issued the order over a petition filed by the two lawmakers seeking it to declare that the placement of their names on the two lists was illegal and that they could travel abroad freely. 
The lawyers for the petitioners insisted their clients were PTI leaders and abided by the law. 
They added that the petitioners were named in concocted cases registered for political reasons. 
The counsel added that they had learned that the names of their clients were placed first on the PNIL and then on the ECL and were not allowed to go outside the country. 
They said the petitioners won elections on Feb 8 and represented their respective areas in the National Assembly. 
Director (legal) of the Federal Investigation Agency Abdur Rehman said the names of the petitioners were placed on the ECL at the request of the caretaker provincial government.
