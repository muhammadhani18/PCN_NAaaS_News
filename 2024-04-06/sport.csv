Manchester United, meanwhile, went into meltdown at Chelsea.  
This was a latest reminder of the gulf that separates English football’s fiercest rivals ahead of their clash at Old Trafford on Sunday.  
Liverpool are back on top after a 3-1 win against Sheffield United, while United conceded two goals in stoppage time in a stunning 4-3 loss at Chelsea.  
Liverpool’s win further demonstrated the resolve of Jurgen Klopp’s team and the growing influence of Alexis Mac Allister, whose stunning second-half strike set up victory.  
Anfield erupted as the Argentina international unleashed an unstoppable drive from the edge of the box in the 76th minute.  
The atmosphere had been getting increasingly tense before that with the game locked at 1-1. Substitute Cody Gakpo added a third for Liverpool in the 90th to make the win look more routine than it was.  
“We needed Macca’s wonder goal to turn it around. The impact he can have is massive,” Klopp said of Mac Allister, who is the first Liverpool midfielder to score or assist in six consecutive games since Steven Gerrard in 2013. “We had to dig very deep, but that is normal. It’s tricky, they had such a low block, but you have to do better. Our attitude was good, the football was not great in a lot of moments.”  
While Liverpool could be knocked off the top again by the time it heads to United on Sunday, the Merseyside club keeps on coming up with the answers as it stares down the challenge of Arsenal and Manchester City.

By contrast, United’s season descended deeper into crisis after losing in dramatic circumstances at Chelsea.  
Chelsea staged a last-gasp comeback with Cole Palmer bagging a hat-trick to turn a match on its head after United seemed to have staged their own unlikely turnaround in a thriller.  
It doesn’t get any easier for Erik ten Hag’s team, which has to pick itself up for the challenge of facing a Liverpool team that is growing in confidence in its pursuit of the title.  
Chelsea had raced into a 2-0 lead inside 20 minutes with a strike by captain Conor Gallagher and a Palmer penalty.  
Goals by Alejandro Garnacho — after a Moises Caicedo error — and Bruno Fernandes before halftime and another in the 67th minutes by Garnacho turned the tide towards United, who are chasing qualification for next season’s Champions League.  
But with the Blues looking beaten, Diogo Dalot brought down Noni Madueke in the box and after a nail-biting VAR check Palmer stroked home from the spot for the second time on the night to level the match at 3-3 in the 10th minute of added time.  
A minute later, he blasted a shot that deflected off United midfielder Scott McTominay into the net to claim his 16th league goal of the season and send the home fans into raptures.  
United’s 12th league defeat of the campaign was played out in front of new co-owner Jim Ratcliffe at Stamford Bridge and came after Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Brentford.  
The pressure on Ten Hag is growing.  
“Definitely a setback and now we have to deal with this and get up,” said Ten Hag. “We are resilient and you have seen that today. The quality of our football is really high, but football is about results and you have to bring it over time.”  
United have struggled this season but they have been a thorn in Liverpool’s side -- drawing away in the league and claiming a 4-3 win in an unforgettable FA Cup quarter-final to end the Anfield side’s hopes of an unprecedented quadruple. 
The tension is also likely to be ramped up on Liverpool assuming Arsenal and City both win on Saturday when they are away at Brighton & Hove Albion and Crystal Palace respectively, although pressure appears to be something Klopp’s side’s thrive on. 
“I am happy we play on Sunday, we cannot change that,” he said. “I don’t see the problem. The game we played tonight was nothing to do with yesterday, and Sunday will be nothing to do with the other results.” 
Mac Allister insisted avenging their FA Cup loss was not the primary motivation with so much already at stake. 
“I don’t know if it’s revenge but for sure it will be an important game for us because if we want to win something we have to win every game and that’s the aim,” said Mac Allister. 
PALMER HAT-TRICK 
Chelsea came into the match without a win against United in 12 Premier League meetings but were ahead in just the fourth minute through captain Gallagher.  
Palmer doubled the home side’s lead with his first penalty in the 19th minute after Anthony felled Marc Cucurella in a torrid opening for the visitors.  
But United were handed a lifeline in the 34th minute when Caicedo inexplicably gave the ball away to Garnacho, who burst forward and coolly slotted home.  
Five minutes later they were all square when Dalot’s cross found Fernandes, who headed home at the back post.  
Play swung wildly from end to end in a thrilling second period but Garnacho headed home a pinpoint cross from the outside of Antony’s left boot to put United ahead.  
The visitors appeared set for all three points but the officials signalled there would be eight minutes of added time and boyhood United fan Palmer turned the game on its head.  
Chelsea coach Mauricio Pochettino, whose grip on the job at Stamford Bridge has been questioned with the club stuck in mid-table, paid tribute to Palmer.  
“The impact is amazing. He is doing a fantastic job, it is difficult to talk more about him. Today he showed the mentality and the quality,” the Argentine told the BBC, adding he had urged Palmer on in the closing minutes. “I said, ‘Cole, two minutes more’ and to believe.”  
The victory took Chelsea up to 10th, five points behind United with a game in hand and still hoping to snatch a Europa League spot despite their stop-start season.  
Liverpool’s win moved it two points clear of second-placed Arsenal and three ahead of City in third, but Sheffield had threatened to spring a surprise in the race for the title.  
A bizarre opener by Darwin Nunez after 17 minutes when he closed down keeper Ivo Grbic and blocked his attempted clearance into the net looked set to open the floodgates as Liverpool sought the win they needed to dislodge Arsenal from top spot.  
But the Reds were way below their best and an adventurous United side stunned the Anfield crowd shortly after halftime when a when Gustavo Hamer met a cross with a header which glanced in off the leg of the unfortunate Connor Bradley.  
Liverpool were struggling to quell a lively United side but Mac Allister took matters in to his own hands with a finish that sent the home crowd into raptures — his fierce shot spinning and rising into the top corner past a helpless Grbic.  
Sheffield are 10 points adrift of the safety zone and look set for a swift return to the Championship.

The Challenge Cup, the first men’s tournament conducted by the FIFA-appointed PFF NC lead by Haroon Malik, kicked off in January last year but only the group stage of the country’s cup football event was played.
The PFF NC failed in organising the knockout round for the whole of last year but has now finally decided on a window from May 1 to 12 to complete the tournament, starting with the round of 16.
“The Round of 16 of the National Challenge Cup 2023 will be held in Lahore from May 1 to 12,” read a PFF NC news release. 
“The top two teams from each of the seven groups, along with the two best third-positioned teams, have secured their places in the Round of 16.
“The details of the teams are as follows: Khan Research Laboratories, Pakistan Army, Pakistan Air Force, Pakistan Navy, WSTC, Otto Crain, SA Farms, Wapda, SA Gardens, Higher Education Commission, Pak-Afghan Clearing Agency, NIMSO, Asia Ghee Mills, Pakistan Railway, Pakistan Police and Masha United.
“To ensure a smooth organisation of the final round, the PFF has already sent invitations to all the participating teams. After receiving the teams’ confirmations, the draws will be conducted and the schedule for the matches will be announced in due course.”
The participating teams have been asked to submit their confirmations by April 10.

England and Wales are set to host the 2026 Women’s T20 World Cup while England, Scotland and Ireland will host the 2030 men’s edition, with Sunak saying the domes will help participation in cricket throughout the year at the grasroots level.
The domes are being built in communities where “figures have indicated low levels of physical activity” in an attempt to inspire more children to take up what is essentially a summer sport and play it the year round.
“For young people watching their first match today, the draw of getting outside and enjoying the game is just as strong, particularly as we look forward to hosting the women’s and men’s T20 World Cups,” Sunak said in a statement.
The investment is set to be delivered over the next five years while 14 million pounds will go to three different charities - Chance to Shine, Lord’s Taverners and ACE.

3,Ex-world champion Quartararo extends deal with Yamaha,PARIS: France’s 2021 MotoGP world champion Fabio Quartararo boosted the morale of the ailing Yamaha team on Friday...,"PARIS: France’s 2021 MotoGP world champion Fabio Quartararo boosted the morale of the ailing Yamaha team on Friday by extending his contract for another two years with the Japanese outfit.
The 24-year-old has won eight MotoGP races and been on the podium 21 times since his debut for them in the elite level in 2019.
He finished runner-up in the title race in 2022 but the team’s performance slipped markedly last year with the Frenchman making the top three just three times and ended up 10th.
“I am super happy to announce that I am going to continue my adventure in BLUE!” said Quartararo in a Yamaha team statement.
“Last winter Yamaha proved to me that they have a new approach and a new aggressive mindset.
“My confidence is high: we will be back at the front together!  “We still have a long way ahead of us to start fighting for victory again.
“I will work hard, and I am sure that, together, we will achieve our dream once more!”
This season has shown little sign of a revival with the French rider — nicknamed ‘El Diablo’ — in 11th spot after two races and garnering just 15 points.
Lin Jarvis, managing director of the team, admitted  “there is much work to do to get back to the competitive level we were at in 2021 and the first half of 2022”.
However, Quartararo’s decision to commit to the team showed he had confidence the team can return to its best.

4,‘Thrilla in Manila’ shorts up for auction,NEW YORK: The shorts worn by Muhammad Ali in his legendary ‘Thrilla in Manila’ boxing match are up for grabs at...,"NEW YORK: The shorts worn by Muhammad Ali in his legendary ‘Thrilla in Manila’ boxing match are up for grabs at Sotheby’s in New York, part of a growing sports memorabilia market eyed by auction houses.
Bids — including the latest for $3.8 million — have been rolling in since late March for the Everlast-brand shorts, which are white with black stripes and are signed by Ali.
The auction is open until April 12.
The sale comes as Sotheby’s is auctioning off a slew of sports lots, including a uniform from NBA star Victor Wembanyama.
Despite a growing interest in historic sporting items, Sotheby’s said that, as of Thursday, the minimum price agreed to by the seller of Ali’s shorts has not yet been reached.
Sotheby’s estimates the shorts could eventually fetch $4-6 million.
Ali’s 1975 ‘Thrilla in Manila’ fight against Joe Frazier was held in the Philippines and followed his ‘Rumble in the Jungle’ bout in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then called Zaire) the year before.
Ali’s fight in the Philippines went to 14 rounds before Fra­zier’s coach threw in the towel.
“It was like death. Closest thing to dying that I know of,” Ali said of the fight, which was held amid stifling heat and humidity, with temperatures heightened by TV lights.
Ali, born Cassius Clay in the southeastern state of Kentucky, is known as both a sporting great and for his role in fighting for civil rights for African Americans. He died in 2016.
Also for sale is a raft of NBA jerseys, including French player Wembanyama’s complete uniform from an exhibition game held earlier this year.
Interest in the game day goods also apparently extends to items from Wembanyama’s locker — including a chair, water bottles and a towel.
For those who don’t have the cash for the jersey, estimated to sell for $80-120,000, the locker contents are estimated to go for $5-7,000.

The former Wimbledon finalist has played just one ATP Tour match since late 2022 after suffering wrist and knee injuries.
However, the 28-year-old told the Australian Open Show podcast he will soon be practising again, having previously hinted his tennis career could be over.
“I’m hitting for the first time next week, so as soon as I get back out on court, I guess it’s just going to be starting up, getting that load back through my wrist and my body,” he said.
Kyrgios, who lost the 2022 Wimbledon final to Novak Djokovic, didn’t give a date when he will be back playing on the ATP Tour.
“I’m going to take my time, come back and just enjoy being back out there,” he said.

“I hope he will be able to play at the Olympic Games,” Macron said when asked by pupils during a visit to a school in the French capital.
Mbappe has previously made clear his desire to represent France at the Games, but that possibility dissipated when Real Madrid recently warned they would not release any of their players to take part in the Olympics.
The 25-year-old World Cup-winning forward is currently at Paris St-Germain but has told the Ligue 1 side he intends to leave when his contract expires at the end of this season, with Real his expected next destination.
The Olympic football tournament — which is for Under-23 players with three overage players allowed per squad — does not fall during FIFA dates for international matches, which means clubs have no obligation to release their players for the competition.
Mbappe will lead France at Euro 2024 which runs from June 14 to July 14 in Germany.
The Olympic football competition begins on July 24 and runs to Aug 9, with France in a group alongside the United States, New Zealand and ano­ther side still to be determined.
Macron also stated that he would go to Germany for the semi-finals and final of Euro 2024 should Les Bleus get there.
“I will go if we are in the semi-finals or in the final,” he said, pointing out that the final in Berlin falls on France’s national day, July 14.

7,Usman Khan banned from UAE cricket for five years,"The 28-year-old was “found to have breached his obligations owed to Emirates Cricket Board”, said a statement from the UAE governing body.","DUBAI: UAE-based batsman Usman Khan was banned from Emirati cricket for five years on Friday after he joined a Pakistan training camp in an apparent bid to play for the country of his birth.
Usman, who has been living and playing in the United Arab Emirates with the intention of representing the Gulf country, was called up to the Pakistan camp after blazing back-to-back centuries last month in the Pakistan Super League.
The 28-year-old was  “found to have breached his obligations owed to Emirates Cricket Board”, said a statement from the UAE governing body.
“After a detailed investigation, Usman was found to have misrepresented to the ECB about his decision to play for the UAE team and has used the opportunities and development provided by the ECB to him to seek out other prospects.”
The decision rules Usman, who was reportedly 14 months from satisfying the residency requirement to play for the UAE, out of the ILT20 and Abu Dhabi T10, both played in the country.
He will now target Pakistan’s T20 series against New Zealand and a ticket to the T20 World Cup in June, which will be held in the United States and the West Indies.

8,Pakistan series ‘awesome opportunity’ for depleted NZ: Allen,"First-choice players like Devon Conway, Will Young, Tim Southee, Colin Munro and Tom Latham are also missing for various reasons including injuries.","NEW DELHI: Despite eight of their senior players set to miss the upcoming five-match Twenty20 International series against Pakistan, New Zealand opener Finn Allen believes the BlackCaps would still be a handful for the Babar Azam-led hosts.
New Zealand will be without the likes of Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner and Kane Williamson, with all engaged in the ongoing Indian Premier League, when they land in Rawalpindi ahead of the first T20, scheduled for April 18.
“It is an awesome opportunity with players being away at the IPL, for young guys such as Tim Robinson, who have shown their talent and had a good Super Smash tournament here in New Zealand during the summer,” Allen was quoted as saying by Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency on Friday.
“… it is rewarding for those guys and allows them to get an opportunity at the top level to see where they stand against a formidable Pakistan side,” he said.
All-rounder Michael Bracewell will be leading the side. He has not been seen in international cricket since March last year following a ruptured Achilles and a broken finger and returned to domestic engagements only recently.
“I guess with the upcoming series, we batted out with them at home not too long ago but it is on their turf now and we know from tours in the past, that they are pretty tough to beat at home,” the 24-year-old said.
“Hopefully, Mark Chapman can pull through for the boys again like last time, but I think it will be a good challenge and a good series,” he added.
Other first-choice players like Devon Conway, Will Young, Tim Southee, Colin Munro and Tom Latham are also missing for various reasons including injuries.
The big-hitting Allen, who has played 43 T20Is and has the highest score by a New Zealander in the format, all-rounder Jimmy Neesham and veteran spinner Ish Sodhi would be expected to be the guiding force for the side.
“… conditions will definitely be different, every game is a new game, and you have to start again, so I am looking forward to the challenges and different conditions, and seeing what we can come up with,” he said of his own role.
Allen hoped that a solid performance against Pakistan would also help him in T20 World Cup selection.
“Every chance you get to play for New Zealand or represent your country is a try-out, and an opportunity to showcase your skills…hopefully, selection takes care of itself, just clear minded on going over to Pakistan and trying to contribute to winning a series,” he said.

The 29-year-old has not played for England in any format since March 2023 because of an elbow injury.
“The whole plan with Jofra is he is going to play white-ball cricket this summer,” Key told Sky Sports on Friday.
Archer’s England career has been plagued by injuries and he has not played a Test match since the tour of India in 2021.
“Jofra’s been out at Sussex’s pre-season in India and bowled quickly out there. He bowled really well,” Key said.
“He’s now just gone back to the Caribbean, where he will play a little bit of club cricket, stuff like that.
“It’s all about getting himself ready for that T20 World Cup. He’ll hopefully play the Pakistan series [in May], but it’s all fingers crossed with Jofra at the moment.
“We’re taking it slowly so we get him back for not just a short period, but a long period.”
The T20 World Cup begins in West Indies and US on June 1.

10,Sami-ul-Hasan returns as PCB media director,"LAHORE: In a surprising turn of events, Aalia Rasheed, the media and communications director of the Pakistan Cricket...","LAHORE: In a surprising turn of events, Aalia Rasheed, the media and communications director of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), tendered her resignation on Friday. Shortly thereafter, Sami-ul-Hasan, the board’s former media director, was announced as her replacement.
Aalia announced her resignation on social media without providing any explanation for her sudden departure. Sami, who had been previously ousted from the position by former PCB chairman Zaka Ashraf, now finds himself back at the helm of the department.
This revolving door of leadership is not new to the PCB, with rapid changes often accompanying shifts in chairmanship. Over the past 14 months alone, there have been four different individuals holding the position of media director; Sami, Umar Farooq, Aalia, and now Sami once again.
Despite attempts by Dawn to obtain a statement from Aalia regarding her resignation, she remained unresponsive. This trend of high-ranking officials departing following a change in leadership is consistent within the PCB.
Recently, the appointments made by current chair­­man Mohsin Naqvi have raised eyebrows. Several government officers, including Rafiullah, have been brought into key positions within the organisation, despite lacking significant cricketing backgrounds. 
It’s rumored that Mohsin intends to appoint another journalist, Amir Mir, as a media consultant, further deviating from traditional cricketing expertise in top roles.
The potential appointment of Amir, who previously served as an information minister under Mohsin’s tenure as caretaker chief minister of Punjab, suggests a trend of favoritism over competence. 
Similarly, the inclusion of Bilal Afzal, another former member of Mohsin’s cabinet, in the national selection committee as an analyst, despite lacking a notable cricketing profile, raises concerns.
In this environment, it is likely that Sami, with his extensive experience as media director, will find himself relegated to a subordinate role under Amir and Rafiullah. 
Despite his decade-long tenure at the ICC in a similar capacity, Sami may now serve merely as an assistant, overshadowed by individuals with closer political ties rather than cricketing expertise.

The International Weightlifting Federation’s (IWF) official website called 20-year-old Juniansyah’s triumph at the men’s 73 kg category  “one of the biggest upsets in weightlifting history”.
Juniansyah lifted 164kg in snatch and 201kg in clean and jerk to achieve a total of 365kg, breaking the previous record of 364kg set by China’s Shi Zhiyong when he won gold at the Tokyo Olympics.
“I can’t believe it, I don’t know what to think,” Juniansyah said. 
“I had appendix surgery about six months ago and I didn’t start training properly until January the first... I can’t take it all in. It’s crazy. I’m so proud.”
Abdullah lifted 165kg in snatch and 195kg in clean and jerk, finishing with a total of 355kg and losing Indonesia’s sole Olympic berth in the weight category to Juniansyah.
Shi also qualified for the Paris Games to defend his gold medal, lifting 165kg in snatch and 191kg in clean and jerk to finish second with a total of 356kg.

12,"Cycling ‘still killing people’, says UNCP chief","PARIS: The president of French professional cyclists’ union (UNCP) on Thursday called on the UCI, the world...","PARIS: The president of French professional cyclists’ union (UNCP) on Thursday called on the UCI, the world governing body, to take “responsibility” for making the sport a safer place. 
Pascal Chanteur said he was “angry” about the recent spate of high-speed crashes which have seen three of the world’s top riders land in hospital in the last week. 
“Do we have to wait for the umpteenth death? For a rider to have both legs cut off and lose his life, so that people become aware? If that’s the idea, we’re not far off,” Chanteur told AFP. 
After Wout van Aert broke his collarbone and several ribs in a high-speed mass fall during last week’s Around Flanders one-day race, there was further carnage on the Tour of the Basque Country on Thursday. 
Two-time Tour de France champion Jonas Vingegaard was taken to hospital after suffering broken bones and lung damage during a crash which also took out Remco Evenepoel, who also suffered a broken collarbone. 
With the race still reeling from the horrific mass crash, Mikel Landa broke his collarbone in Friday’s stage five, where Soudal Quick-Step riders Landa and Gil Gelders were forced out. 
Spaniard Landa, who finished second in the race last year and in 2018, was pictured on a stretcher being put in an ambulance. 
“I’m not saying that the UCI is responsible but they do have a responsibility to take the full measure of our recommendations to make progress on safety,” said Chanteur. 
“For example, we’re perfectly capable of reducing speeds by changing tyres. Why can Formula 1 do it and we can’t? We’re the only sport that doesn’t know how to adapt, and we’re still killing people.” 
Chanteur said the increased number of crashes was in part due to an increasing amount of “street furniture” but was caused principally by the  “increasingly avant-garde” materials used in making the bikes. 
“Carbon is light and very rigid, so there’s no room for error,” he said. “Wheels and tyres are nothing like those used in the past. Drama can happen at any moment. Disc brakes in racing are too dangerous. The same applies to the gear ratios used. Today, we use 56x10. They’re going 80 km/h downhill, even though they’re almost naked. When there’s a fall, you have no way of escaping.” 
UCI president David Lappartient told AFP that the question of disc brakes was one that deserved discussion. 
“It’s a subject we want to put back on the table,” he said. “There’s no such thing as a taboo subject. Equipment is obviously an issue. Bikes have made an extraordinary leap forward.” 
Lappartient, however, also intimated the riders were themselves partly to blame for the crashes. 
“Fifty percent of the falls are due to their attitude,” he said. “I’m not here to say it’s their fault. It could be a moment of inattention. But that’s also why we want to introduce a principle of yellow and red cards this year, like in soccer, so that dangerous attitudes are better punished.” 
Dutchman Mathieu van der Poel, aiming to retain his Paris Roubaix title this weekend, also feels that riders are the main danger when it comes to race safety. 
“I think the most dangerous part of cycling is the riders themselves,” Van der Poel told a press conference before Sunday’s race. “We take the risks and that’s the main problem, everyone wants to be at the front in the same place and it’s not possible. We can change a lot of things to make it better, but it’s never going to be completely secure.” 
World champion Van der Poel won his third Tour of Flanders last Sunday, and this Sunday he is favourite to successfully defend his Paris Roubaix title. 
Race organisers have implemented a chicane in an effort to slow the riders down as they head into the notorious cobbled Trouee d’Arenberg, one of the most dangerous sections of the Hell of the North. 
Chanteur, meanwhile, said the peloton has been “angry” at the current situation since Fabio Jakobsen’s life-threatening accident at the 2020 Tour of Poland but the cyclists were powerless to speak out. 
“It’s not easy for a rider to say what I say,” said the 56-year-old former journeyman professional cyclist. “They’re salaried employees and the main financial backers of cycling are still the cycle brands. 
“I’m pointing the finger at these people [the cycle manufacturers]. It’s up to them to decide whether they want to continue having accidents on their conscience, or even deaths.”

13,Verstappen fastest before rain spoils Japanese GP practice,Verstappen and Perez were among several drivers who stayed in the garage as the teams tried to preserve their tyres in the tricky conditions.,"SUZUKA: Max Verstappen went fastest on Friday in the first practice for the Japanese Grand Prix, with the second session badly affected by rain.
Triple world champion Verstappen, who failed to finish the race in Australia a fortnight ago, edged Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez in dry conditions in the first session in Suzuka.
But it was a different story later in the day when only five drivers recorded a timed lap in on-off showers, with McLaren’s Oscar Piastri going quickest ahead of Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton.
Verstappen and Perez did not come out for the second practice.
They were among several drivers who stayed in the garage as the teams tried to preserve their tyres in the tricky conditions.
“In FP2 we couldn’t do anything, which was a shame as this means that we don’t know the long-run pace, but we can’t do anything about the weather,” said Verstappen.
“In general, it looks like everyone is a bit closer compared to last year and I don’t expect the same kind of gaps here at this track.”
Verstappen won the first two grands prix of the season but the Dutchman retired from a race for the first time in two years in Melbourne after a brake issue.
Normal service resumed in the first practice, in a session that was red-flagged for around 10 minutes after Williams driver Logan Sargeant crashed into a wall of tyres.
Verstappen clocked a fastest lap of 1min 30.056sec — 0.181sec quicker than Perez.
“There are a few things that we still want to look at tomorrow [Saturday] but overall I felt quite happy with what we had and the laps that we did,” said Verstappen.
Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz, who won in Australia after returning from appendicitis surgery, was third-fastest at 1min 30.269sec.
George Russell was fourth-quickest followed by Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc coming home in sixth.
Hamilton, who has had a difficult start to the season, said it was  “a great session” for Mercedes.
“It was the best session for us so far this year and the best the car has felt,” said the seven-time world champion.
“I felt very positive and excited heading into FP2 as this is a circuit that every driver loves to drive.
“It was a shame not to get much running in, therefore.”
The second session saw very little action until a late flurry of activity.
Australian Piastri ended up on top, clocking 1min 34.725sec to finish 0.501sec clear of Hamilton.
Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc was third ahead of RB pair Yuki Tsunoda and Daniel Ricciardo, but no other driver managed to record a timed lap.
“Not a lot going on in FP2 but I was able to get a couple of laps in at the end in tricky conditions,” said Piastri, who finished third at last year’s race.
“I think it’s been an OK day. It’s difficult to get a good reading on everybody’s pace.”
Sargeant did not take part in the second session after crashing earlier in the day.
The American came skidding off the track at a corner and spun across the gravel before slamming into a barrier midway through the session.
He walked away unhurt and his car was carried off by a crane.
Williams boss James Vowles said the damage to Sargeant’s car was  “extensive”.
“He struggled to see where his position was on the track, so it fundamentally looks like he didn’t quite realise where he was,” said Vowles.
