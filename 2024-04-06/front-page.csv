• Set to depart for Saudi Arabia today in first foreign trip since assuming office
• Reaffirms support for Palestinians, condemns Israeli oppression
ISLAMABAD: Amid resurgence of terrorist activities in the country, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced on Friday his intention to regularly review and audit the country’s security standard operating procedures (SOPs).
The prime minister decided that he would himself monitor the security situation in the country and the audit of SOPs, and called for foolproof security for Chinese nationals working on different projects in Pakistan.
“The prime minister also instructed (officials) to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for the regular audit of the security SOPs,” the Prime Minister Office said in a statement after a meeting on the security situation.
“The prime minister decided to personally review the meetings with respect to the overall security of the country, especially the security of the Chinese citizens,” it added.
Mr Sharif, who chaired the meeting, said war against terrorism would continue until its eradication and directed the interior ministry to root out the menace from the country and increase collaboration with provinces to improve the provincial anti-terrorism departments.
The interior ministry briefed the prime minister about its performance and the country’s overall law and order situation.
The meeting was attended by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, top brass of the security agencies and other top officials concerned.
A source privy to the meeting told Dawn that the prime minister will chair the meeting on the audit of security SOPs on a monthly basis.
The premier expressed satisfaction over the already devised security procedures, but directed the authorities concerned to implement them vigorously.
The meeting also stressed the need to prevent cross-border terrorism from Afghanistan and noted that leftover arms and ammunition of US forces were being used by militants against Pakistan. “We all know that from where these arms and ammunition is coming and where it is being dumped,” the sources quoted Mr Sharif as saying.
During the meeting, interior ministry officials presented several proposals to beef up security in the country.
Visit to Saudi Arabia
In a separate development, Prime Minister Sharif is set to start a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia today (Saturday), marking his first foreign trip since assuming office last month, during which he is expected to pursue economic support from the kingdom.
The premier is visiting Saudi Arabia from April 6 to 8, during the last days of Ramazan, the Foreign Office said in a statement, adding that this would be his first foreign visit since his election.
The prime minister would be accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising Foreign Min­ister Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Cheema.
Mr Sharif will meet Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh.
The Foreign Office said the prime minister’s discussions with the Saudi leadership would be focused on “issues of mutual interest” besides the exchange of views on regional and global developments.
Given Saudi Arabia’s history of financially assisting Pakistan, the economic crisis facing the country, and the composition of the delegation, it’s obvious that Mr Sharif would seek economic assistance from Saudi Arabia.
“The leadership of both countries is committed to advancing the fraternal ties and mutually rewarding economic and investment relations,” the Foreign Office said. The prime minister will also perform Umrah in Makkah and visit Madina.
Al Quds Day
In a message on Al Quds Day, annually observed on the last Friday of Ramazan, PM Sharif reiterated that Pakistan would continue its moral and diplomatic support to the people of Palestine until their liberation and the establishment of an independent Palestine state according to pre-1967 borders.
He said the entire nation condemned Zionist oppression and expressed solidarity with Palestinian people.
Fir the past seven decades, Israel had illegally occupied Palestine and Jerusalem and continuously violated international laws and human rights to maintain its occupation while the international community acted as a silent spectator, the PM added. The Israeli atrocities spanned over the last seven decades, but its intensity “increased manifold” since October last year.
He demanded the international community to play its role to pressure Israel to stop the oppression. He requested Muslims in Pakistan and all over the world observing the last Friday of Ramazan to pray for their Palestinian and Kashmiri brothers and sisters.

1,More judges receive letters with ‘toxic’ powder,"Four suspicious letters addressed to PM, Punjab CM found in Rawalpindi letterbox.","• Four suspicious letters addressed to PM, Punjab CM found in Pindi letterbox
• Guidelines issued for postal staff to handle suspicious mail
ISLAMABAD: Ten more suspicious letters, some of them laced with “toxic” powder and threatening writings, addressed to judges of the higher courts as well as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz were found by the authorities on Friday.
Sources said that of the 10 letters recovered on Friday, six were addressed to the Supreme Court judges, including Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, one to Justice Ali Baqar Najafi of the Lahore High Court (LHC), two letters addressed to Maryam Nawaz and one to Mr Sharif.
The five other letters received at the Supreme Court were addressed to Justices Mohammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Irfan Saadat, and Munib Akhtar.
The letter to the LHC judge was received by his personal staff, whereas the four other letters were detected by the staff of a post office in Dhoke Gujran, a locality in Rawalpindi. However, no chemical or powder was found in the envelopes recovered from the letterbox of the post office in Rawalpindi.
Police officers told Dawn that after getting information from the Supreme Court’s staff about the receipt of the suspicious letters, a police team reached the court and took the letters into custody for further legal action.
They said these letters were received in the routine mail to the top court’s Receipt and Issue (R&I) branch the same day as the letters to four other judges — Chief Justice Isa, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, and Justice Aminud Din Khan — and were forwarded to the judges’ staff. However, these envelopes were opened on Friday.
The police officers said there was no need to register a fresh case after receiving five more letters; it would be mentioned in a supplementary statement in the FIR already registered at the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD).
The FIR, containing Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act and Section 507 of the Pakistan Penal Code, was lodged on the complaint of Mohammad Iqbal, the duty in-charge at the Supreme Court’s R&I branch.
The police said it had collected a sample of powder from all five letters and would send it to the National Forensic Science Laboratory, Islamabad, for toxicological and chemical tests and analyses.
“Welcome to Bacillus anthracis!!!” were the words written in the letters, which also contained a photo of a human skull.
Bacillus anthracis is a bacterium that causes anthrax, a rare but serious infectious disease that affects people and animals.
LHC judge
Justice Ali Baqar Najafi has become the sixth judge of the LHC to receive the suspicious letter. The staff of the senior judge found a letter during the scrutiny of daily mail received at the high court. The staff did not open the envelope and alerted the police authorities who took possession of the letter and handed it over to the CTD for investigation.
Before this, five judges of the LHC, including Chief Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed Khan, Justice Shujaat Ali Khan, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, Justice Aalia Neelum and Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh had received threatening letters with suspicious powder.
An initial investigation by the security and forensic experts revealed that the letters sent to the LHC judges did not contain anthrax or any other toxic powder, rather “carbohydrates having arsenic traces”. However, the authorities have not so far traced the alleged dispatcher(s).
The security officials are using the surveillance cameras of the Punjab Safe City Authority to trace the dispatchers of the suspicious letters. The home department and other agencies have decided that the judges’ staff should be provided with scanners to scan suspicious letters or envelopes before opening.
The department has also decided to give necessary training to all LHC judges’ staff, equipping them with gadgets to handle suspicious letters and articles in an safe manner.
Suspicious letters found in Rawalpindi
The four suspicious letters add­ressed to the prime minister, the Punjab chief minister and the CJP were found in a letter box outside the post office of Dhoke Gujran area of Naseer­abad Police Station in Rawalpindi.
According to the sources, the letter box had been opened by the staff for collection of mail as per the routine on Thursday night. There was no address or any identity of the senders on the envelopes.
A senior police officer said the post office staff, as per the policy, informed the higher officials of the postal department after finding the suspicious letters, after which experts reached the spot and inspected the letters.
He said there was a newspaper clipping in the letter in which an appeal was made to abolish the food authority. “There was nothing serious, only fake news,” he said.
The official in charge of the post office later told the police that he did not know as to who had dropped these envelopes in the letter box and at what time. The staff came to know about it only after they sorted out the mail, he told the police.
Guidelines for postal staff
Meanwhile, the office of the Director General Pakistan Post on Friday issued instructions to its staff regarding the handling of mail addressed to high-profile personalities.
The office directed all postmasters general to circulate an alert to all offices countrywide to take due care and be vigilant while handling mail addressed to high-profile offices in the wake of the suspected letters being delivered to the higher judiciary.
Moreover, it stressed that the safety and security of the postal operational staff is the prime responsibility and the first priority.
Besides, every necessary mat­erial which is required in such circumstances i.e., gloves, masks etc., should be provided to the staff involved in handling mail, and the mail articles brought in post offices after clearance of letter boxes should be carefully handled, the instructions issued by the office said.
If any unattended and suspected material is observed in the mail articles, it should immediately be reported to the supervisor on duty, local administration and the head of the unit and circle concerned.
Staff posted at counters and delivery post offices should also be directed to remain vigilant while booking, sorting, transmitting and delivering mail, it said.
It said the mail for the judges of Supreme Court, high courts, diplomats and other high-profile personalities should be examined carefully and should be delivered in the R&I section of the relevant office.
The directives have been issued to the postmasters general in Lahore, Multan, Rawal­pindi, Karachi, Hyderabad, Islamabad, Peshawar, Quetta and Muzaffarabad.

3,UN rights body demands halt in arms sales to Israel,Guterres regrets Tel Aviv brings relentless death and destruction to Gaza.," 

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres speaks to the press in New York on Friday.—AFP

UNITED NATIONS: The UN Human Rights Council on Friday demanded a halt in all arms sales to Israel, highlighting warnings of “genocide” in its aggression in Gaza, which has killed more than 33,000 people.
Meanwhile, UN Secre­tary General António Guterres condemned the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, noting it has only brought “relentless death and destruction” to the besieged Palestinian enclave.
In Geneva, the 47-member UNHRC in a resolution presented by Pakistan on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation noted that Israel was “using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare” in Gaza.
The resolution was adopted by 28 to 6 votes and 13 abstentions. The council backed a call “to cease the sale, transfer, and diversion of arms, munitions, and other military equipment to Israel, the occupying Power…to prevent further violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights”.

Guterres regrets Tel Aviv brings relentless death and destruction to Gaza

The resolution also underscored the need for stopping egregious human rights violations in the occupied Palestinian territory.
Co-sponsors of the text included Bolivia, Cuba, and the State of Palestine, ahead of the vote which saw support from more than two dozen countries, including Brazil, China, Luxembourg, Malaysia, and South Africa.
Death, destruction
At a news briefing in New York, UN chief Guterres said: “Over the last six months, the Israeli military campaign has brought relentless death and destruction to  Palestinians in Gaza.”
More than 33,000 people were reportedly killed and over 75,000 others injured — the vast majority women and children, he regretted.
He declared that ‘nothing can justify the collective punishment’ in Gaza and urged Israel to allow “a quantum leap” in aid. “Lives are shattered. Respect for international law is in tatters,” Mr Guterres told journalists at the UN Headquarters.
The resulting humanitarian disaster, he noted, was unprecedented, with more than a million “facing catastrophic hunger”.
He pointed out that children in Gaza were dying due to a lack of food and water. “This is incomprehensible and entirely avoidable,” the UN chief said, reiterating that nothing can justify such collective punishment.
Weaponising AI
Mr Guterres said he was deeply troubled by reports that the Israeli military has been using artificial intelligence to help identify targets during its relentless bombing of densely populated areas of Gaza.
“No part of life and death decisions which impact entire families should be delegated to the cold calculation of algorithms,” he said.
AI should only be used as a force for good, not to wage war “on an industrial level, blurring accountability”, the UN chief added.
Branding the war “the deadliest of conflicts” in decades, he highlighted that 196 humanitarians, including over 175 UN staffers, have been killed, the vast majority serving with the Palestine relief agency UNRWA.
“An information war has added to the trauma — obscuring facts and shifting blame,” said Mr Guterres, noting that Israel was denying journalists entry into Gaza, encouraging disinformation to spread.
‘Tactics must change’
Commenting on the appalling killing of seven staffers of the World Central Kitchen, he said the main problem was not who made the mistakes but “the military strategy and procedures in place that allow for those mistakes to multiply time and time again.”
Emphasising the need to change the military strategy, he said: “Fixing those failures requires independent investigations and meaningful and measurable changes on the ground.”
Mr Guterres said Israel had told the UN that it was now planning to allow a “meaningful increase” in the flow of aid to Gaza.
Hoping that the increase in aid would materialise quickly, he warned that the failure to do so would be disastrous.
“Dramatic humanitarian conditions require a quantum leap in the delivery of life-saving aid — a true paradigm shift,” he added.
Recalling last week’s Security Council resolution, he said: “All those demands must be implemented. Failure would be unforgivable.”

4,Pakistan Bar Council proposes sitting SC judges’ commission on ‘meddling’ issue,"Condemns social media campaign against CJP, IHC chief justice.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Bar Council — the premier regulatory body of lawyers — on Friday demanded a judicial commission comprising sitting Supreme Court judges to look into complaints about the alleged meddling of intelligence agencies in judicial affairs.
In its 242nd meeting held here at the SC building, the PBC stated that the formation of a judicial commission was necessary for an impartial investigation, devoid of any external interference, which was crucial to find the truth.
The demand came on a day when former Sup­reme Court Bar Associ­ation (SCBA) presi­dent Abid Shahid Zuberi also approached the apex court to become a party in the suo motu proceedings on the issue.
The PBC at its meeting, which was presided over by council’s vice chairman Riazat Ali Sahar, also took notice of the demand for the resignation of Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and condemned the social media campaign against them.

Condemns social media campaign against CJP, IHC chief justice

In a resolution adopted at the meeting, the PBC stated that the trolling was uncalled for, as such demand amounted to strengthening the hands of those who wanted divisions in the judiciary. Calling for their resignation would not only undermine the judiciary but also fail to resolve the existing issues, the PBC stated, adding that it would rather worsen the situation.
The meeting discussed in detail the issue of alleged interference by the intelligence agencies in judicial affairs in the wake of the March 25 letter written by six IHC judges to the Supreme Judicial Coun­cil (SJC).
While the government constituted a one-man commission comprising retired Justice Tassaduq Jillani to probe the allegations, he recused himself from it. Subse­quently, a seven-judge SC bench took  suo motu notice of the case. At its hearing, the CJP hinted at establishing a full court bench to proceed with the matter.
In its resolution, the PBC urged the SC to decide the present suo motu case as expeditiously as possible. It stated the judges held highest esteem in the nation, carrying significant responsibility of adjudicating cases and meticulously deliberating allegations before reaching verdicts.
According to the resolution, judges epitomise legal system’s foundation, embodying independence and impartiality, free from political or external pressures to administer justice untainted by extraneous moral, internal or external influences. When judges express concern through a written letter, it is a moment of great significance and concern to independent working of judicial system of Pakistan, the PBC pointed out.
To safeguard law, constitution and fundamental rights of citizens, a comprehensive investigation into the allegations was “not only justified but necessary”, the council asserted.
The PBC feared that the fact that judges raised the issue implied they had been “cornered” by the agencies, leading them to cry for assistance from the highest legal forum in hierarchy of judicial system.
On the other hand, former SCBA president Zuberi filed a petition to become a party in the case, urging the SC to direct the SJC to prescribe guidelines to be observed by judges during instances of blackmail, coercion and harassment in future.
The ex-president of the SCBA also asked the SC to also pass a restraining order requiring the executive, including intelligence agencies, from interfering in the functions of the judiciary.
The SC was further requested to issue an order for the prosecution of the members of the executive responsible for such interference to hold them accountable.
The petitioner demanded that the court ensure that strict notice be taken, at an institutional level, of the concerns raised by the six IHC judges and fix responsibility for alleged interference in the affairs of the judiciary across all levels including lower and superior judiciary.

5,ECC’s indecisiveness leaves wheat growers in limbo,"‘Inexperience, confusion’ mar meeting, new members given basic briefing on wheat operations.","ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet has failed to approve a clear-cut cash credit limit to the provinces and other stakeholders for wheat procurement despite two days of lengthy meetings.
Informed sources claimed that a lack of experience in handling public interest matters appeared to be the key factor, as the ECC, led by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, was itself confused as to why the government should approve credit covers instead of allowing wheat operations to market forces.
This indecision comes despite expectations of a bumper wheat harvest this year, with projections safely surpassing 28 million tonnes, and some estimates even pointing towards a record 29m tonnes.
The ECC members, many of whom are new to the committee, were briefed by bureaucrats about the very basics of the wheat operations on technical grounds, and political angles that may come up in the following meeting of the federal cabinet.

‘Inexperience, confusion’ mar meeting, new members given basic briefing on wheat operations

Most participants were unaware of the wheat prices in the market. Various wheat prices were quoted, starting from Rs3,200 per 40kg, although official support price fixed by various provincial governments were higher than Rs4,200 per 40kg.
The procurement rate set by Passco, the country’s agency responsible for maintaining strategic food stocks, would be Rs3,900 per 40kg, followed by Rs4,000 of Sindh and Rs4,300 of Balochistan. On the insistence of the secretaries of finance and food, it was decided that incidental charges would be borne by the respective provincial governments.
A participant told Dawn that the ECC finally approved about Rs275 billion cash credit limit for wheat operations of smaller stakeholders to ensure procurement of 2.45m tonnes in the public sector.
This, however, did not include the largest producer and stakeholder, Punjab, that last year procured 4.5m tonnes alone — almost more than double the procurement by all other participants. This time around, it neither committed any procurement target nor sought a cash credit limit.
Of the total 2.45m procurement targets with Rs274.7bn credit requirement, Passco would pick 1.4m tonnes from the farmers with a credit limit of Rs169bn, followed by one million tonnes by Sindh worth Rs100bn and 50,000 tonnes by Balochistan with Rs5.7bn. This apparently meant the bumper wheat output had put the farmers in a difficult position and being exploited by financially strong market forces.
Minister for Industries Rana Tanveer Hussain, who has also been given the additional portfolio for the Ministry of National Food Security, also attended the ECC meeting on the second day in view of the challenging discussions on the first day.
Mainly because of this, the ECC could not find a way forward on Thursday on the issue and decided to call provincial governments for their advice and input. The provinces joined the extended ECC meeting on Friday, marred by inordinate delay on part of the finance minister to attend the meeting.
The two-day ECC meeting schedules kept on rolling because of interventions by the Prime Minister’s Office for other engagements. As a result, the Ministry of Finance could not issue a customary concluding statement about the ECC decisions on both days which would now be “checked” by the PM Office. It would be first time that the public as well as the farmers would remain unaware about their fate in meetings held at their expense and attended by public representatives.
The ECC approved about Rs200bn cash credit limit to the Sindh government, half of that for the procurement of about one million tonnes of wheat and the remaining half for past rollovers. Another official explained that fresh Rs100bn approval was only for one million out of fresh crop.
Punjab declined to seek credit limit, stressing that it would intervene into the market when it finds reasonable evidence about farmers being fleeced and to come to their aid for official stocks at approved wheat support price.
The new ECC members were told that cash credit limits were approved by the committee for the provinces and federal agencies to raise funds from the financial sector and the State Bank of Pakistan to keep a cap on public loans and guarantees.
In the absence of such an arrangement, the provinces had created huge liabilities and overdrafts in commodity operations a couple of years back. With the intervention of the finance ministry and the international Monetary Fund (IMF), these commodity operations and liabilities were gradually brought to sustainable levels.
The Ministry of National Food Security warned the ECC that even the proposed targets for this year by Sindh, Balochistan and Passco at 2.45 million tonnes were “insufficient to mitigate the provincial requirements despite the presence of carry-forward stocks of 3.25m tonnes as of last month. It put on record that public wheat procurement target for last year (2023) was set at 7.8 million tonnes, including 4.5m tonnes of Punjab.
The meeting was told that the public sector, comprising Passco and provincial governments, procures local wheat on the profitable support price announced by the federal cabinet to stabilise wheat prices and to ensure fair returns to farmers during the post-harvest period.
Passco procures wheat from Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan and supplies it to deficit provinces, areas and agencies. Simi­larly, provincial food departments procure wheat from their growers and release it to the flour mills of the respective province as per the release policy appro­ved by provincial cabinets.
