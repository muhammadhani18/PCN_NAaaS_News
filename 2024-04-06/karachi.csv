0,Concerns raised over ‘flawed’ selection boards in KU syndicate meeting,KARACHI: A meeting of the syndicate of Karachi University (KU) held on Friday after a gap of more than four months...,"KARACHI: A meeting of the syndicate of Karachi University (KU) held on Friday after a gap of more than four months saw senior teachers raising serious reservations over the recently held selection boards and the “distorted minutes” of the last meeting presented for approval before the forum.
Sources said the two-hour meeting could only take up a few items of the 300-page agenda that included a list of actions taken by the vice chancellor over the year.
The teachers, they said, objected to the minutes of the last meeting of the forum, describing it as flawed and called for corrections. 
During the last meeting held in November, the sources said, the forum led by the vice chancellor approved the budget without providing a copy of the complete document to its members prior to the meeting and time to review it.
The sources said the 10-page summary given to the members during the meeting didn’t reflect the actual financial situation.
“The budget was approved in haste on the ground that the Sindh government would be approving Rs1 billion budget for the university. But there was no mention of this amount in the minutes of the last meeting,” shared senior KU teacher Dr Riaz Ahmed, also member of the university syndicate.
According to him, when the members raised their voice over the matter, the vice chancellor told them that no such amount was mentioned in the last meeting.
“We also raised serious concern over the selection boards. Many qualified internal and external candidates are being deprived of promotions and appointments because of the flawed selection process adopted by the KU administration,” he said, adding that the vice chancellor refused to entertain those complaints.
He also criticised the vice chancellor for not calling the syndicate meeting on a monthly basis and taking administrative decisions without approval from the statutory body.
The way the university was being run would only aggravate the crisis it was already facing, he said.

3,Comments sought on PTI man’s plea against victory of PPP candidate in NA-241,KARACHI: An election tribunal on Friday issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and other...,"KARACHI: An election tribunal on Friday issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and other respondents in a petition filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Khurram Sher Zaman, impugning the victory of a Pakistan Peoples Party candidate on the National Assembly constituency NA-241 in the metropolis.
Led by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhry of the Sindh High Court (SHC), the tribunal asked the ECP, returning officer (RO), returned candidate Mirza Ikhtiar Baig of the PPP and others as well as the federal and provincial law officers to file comments till April 19.
Submitting that he had contested the Feb 8 general elections as independent candidate from NA-241 (Karachi South-III) after his party lost its electoral symbol, the petitioner asked the tribunal to set aside the impugned result/notification and declare him as returned candidate.
He contended that as per Form-45s, obtained by his polling agents from the presiding officers at all the polling stations of the constituency, he had secured 79,530 votes and Mr Baig could get only 20,303 votes.
However, the petitioner alleged that the respondents robbed him of 30,920 votes as his votes were brought down to 48,610 and those of the PPP’s aspirant increased by 32,153 votes through tampering and forgery, declaring him the winner with total votes of 52,456. 
Meanwhile, the same tribunal on Friday issued notices to the election watchdog and others for April 19, in an identical petition filed by another PTI-backed candidate.
Fauzia Siddiqui contended that she had run in the election from PS-125 (Karachi Central-IV) and as per Form-45s, she got the highest votes.
However, the petitioner alleged that the elections were rigged and Adil Askari of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan was declared successful with over 63,800 votes and her votes were reduced to around 39,500 votes. 
Notice issued to Saeed Ghani
Another election tribunal on Friday put the ECP, Sindh Minister Saeed Ghani and others on notice in an election petition filed by Grand Democratic Alliance’s candidate Irfanullah Marwat, challenging the result of a provincial assembly seat.
The tribunal headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha of the SHC also issued notices to the advocate general of Sindh and deputy attorney general, directing them assist the tribunal on the question of maintainability of a petition as well as terms of electoral laws.
It also issued notice to Mr Ghani, returned candidate from PS-105 (Karachi East-IX), through the Sindh Assembly speaker for May 10.
Marwat submitted that he had run in the elections from PS-105 (Karachi East-IX) and alleged that the process in several polling stations were rigged by rival Pakistan People Party candidate Saeed Ghani as the results of those polling stations showed that 90 per cent of votes were cast there.
According to Form-47 issued by the ECP, Mr Ghani secured 26,168 votes and Mr Marwat stood as runner-up with 20,111 votes.

4,"Victim of domestic violence, abuse buried silently in Lowari Sharif: police","Badin court orders exhumation, constitution of medical board","BADIN: A 35-year-old mother of three children, who died reportedly after having suffered months of abuse and domestic violence in virtual detention in Hyderabad by several suspects, including her brother, was silently buried in Lowari Sharif graveyard on March 26, according to police officials. 
Police came to know about the incident after a video went viral on social media a day ago in which the victim, who gave her name as Anna Unnar, could be heard relating to her anonymous rescuer that her brother Khadim Unnar and his associates had dumped her on a roadside somewhere in Hyderabad after subjecting her to inhuman violence and abuse in confinement, which left her nearly dead, they said. 
They said that preliminary investigations showed the victim and her family originally belonged to Lowari Sharif and later moved to Larkana. The woman was given in marriage to her relative Rafeeq Unnar under the outdated custom of addo-baddo or watta satta with Rafeeq having given the hand of his sister to Saddam (Anna’s brother) 17 years ago, they said.
They said that Anna, who had moved with her husband to his village, Chibbar Unnar, near Sita Road town in Dadu district left her husband’s house about seven months back due to maltreatment at the hands of her husband and took refuge with her brother Khadim in Hyderabad where, according to her own statement, she was allegedly imprisoned, abused and tortured, which led to her death.

Badin court orders exhumation, constitution of medical board 

She could be heard telling her rescuer in answer to his queries that he and his friends had found her in a serious condition at an abandoned place in Hyderabad and that she had suffered untold amounts of abuse and torture for the past seven months at the hands of her brother and his associates.
Sources in Lowari Sharif said that the victim’s husband Rafeeq and her brother Khadim brought her body to the town on March 26 and secretly buried it in the graveyard without informing anybody.
Senior Superintendent of Police Sheeraz Nazeer took notice of the incident and wrote a letter to the court concerned seeking permission for exhuming the victim’s body at the Lowari Sharif graveyard and having its post mortem conducted. 
Court grants exhumation 
The court of civil and judge and judicial magistrate-I, Badin, allowed exhumation of the victim’s body on an application filed by Police Inspector Mehmood Pathan, SHO of Badin police station, on Friday. 
The court further directed the SHO to set up a picket at the graveyard and make correspondence with Director General of Health Services Sindh with reference to this order asking him to constitute a medical aboard for carrying out exhumation of the victim’s body and determining cause of her death.

6,Teenager shot dead in employers’ bungalow in Latifabad,Co-workers tell police he was killed by his masters’ visiting friend,"HYDERABAD: Two brothers — owners of some agricultural lands in Rahuki and a bungalow in Qasimabad — were booked along with one of their friends on Friday after murder of formers’ 15-year-old domestic servant sometime during the previous night at their residence.  
The victim, Mahmood Mallah, belonged to a peasant family and was hired by the landowners, Hassan and Hussain, sons of late Ejaz Magsi. 
Qasimabad SHO Sajjad Jatoi quoted two other domestic servants, Shahid Mallah and Atar Mallah, who are cousins of the deceased and also worked at the bungalow, as telling the police that Mahmood was serving his employers, Hassan and Hussain, and their visiting friend, Muntazir Shah, while they were probably enjoying drinks on Thursday night. According to the Mallahs, they heard gunshot sound and rushed to the room where they [Hassan, Hussain and Muntazir] were present. The Mallahs stated that they saw Mahmood lying in a pool of blood on carpet and Muntazir Shah holding a gun in his hands.
The SHO said that Muntazir Shah hailed from Moro. He also quoted the Mallahs as saying that the Magsi brothers [Hassan and Hussain] asked Atar Mallah to take away the body and that they would handle the police on their own.

Co-workers tell police he was killed by his masters’ visiting friend 

When the body was taken to the home of Mahmood Mallah in Allah Bachayo Mirbahar village of Tando Qaiser, his shocked relatives and neighbours gathered there. Atar Mallah narrated the episode to them, and said that before Mahmood was shot, the Magsi brothers and Muntazir Shah kept calling him into the room and later vented their anger on him.
Mahmood’s mother, Maddam Mallah, wife of Laloo Mallah, lodged a murder FIR at the Latifabad police station on Friday against the three suspects. She stated in the FIR that Hassan Magsi wanted her son to accompany him to his Latifabad residence from his Rahuki lands but Mahmood was reluctant. She further stated that Hassan forcibly took him to his residence, located in Muslim Society, Latifabad.
According to the SHO, Mahmood had succumbed to his gunshot wounds as he was not taken to any hospital. He said the matter was not reported to the police until the deceased youth’s mother approached the Latifabad police station to lodge the FIR. 
The body was brought to the Qasimabad police station on Thursday night and sent to the Liaquat University Hospital (LUH), Hyderabad, for a postmortem examination.

9,Inflation fails  to dampen Eid shopping spirit,"After clothes, time comes for buying footwear, jewellery and, lastly, make-up."," 

Clockwise from top left: Eid shoppers throng Hyderi Market; dangly earrings and jhumkas glitter at a Jama Cloth Market stall; shopping for cosmetics and make-up items underway at Hyderi; at Tariq Road, women buy bangles to match their Eid outfits; and look for matching footwear at the Gulf Shopping Mall in Clifton.—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

KARACHI: “Everything is so expensive. I inquired about the price of just one or two things before coming out here. Then I needed to sit down and breathe,” Farida, middle-aged shopper, who was sitting on one of the entrance steps of the Gold Mark II shopping Centre on main Korangi Road in DHA Phase I, told Dawn.
“My children are inside doing their shopping. But not me. The joy of Eid is for the young after all,” she added as a vendor selling waistband bundles and elastic rolls walked up to her. And she got busy bargaining with him though not finding much success there as well.
“True, things are expensive, but we are also coping with the situation. Where we used to buy many pairs of earrings or sets of bangles to go with different dresses, looking at the prices, we now look for something which would go with different outfits, Eid clothes and others in the cupboard,” said another shopper checking out the earrings, rings and lockets.
“You cannot run from the rising costs. Inflation follows you everywhere,” a decked up transgender person, who introduced herself as Gulabo, observed.

After clothes, time comes for buying footwear, jewellery and, lastly, make-up

The jewellery she wore, she said she had shopped from Tariq Road. “It’s slightly more reasonably priced there with more variety too,” she added.
The shoppers were found crowding the footpaths on Tariq Road with so many vendors selling bangles, jewellery, bags, footwear and clothes off their carts or racks. Most brands with huge clear glass windows offering a look inside their outlets looked quite empty. Still, a young shopper, Safina, coming out of a mall with bags that had some label or the other printed on them, said that they went to the high-end shops because they didn’t want to venture into the crowds though the stuff there looked interesting.
As the young shopper got into her car, a mother and daughter busy selecting un-stitched voile suits from a cart, who had heard her were seen shaking their heads. “But she should have made an effort to come to this side and explore. This city teaches us to make an effort, to dare,” said the mother. “See, we found such good bargain deals,” she showed off her purchases. Asked if she was worried about finding a tailor for her purchases with Eid so close, she shook her head and smiled. “I can stitch clothes. It saves me and my daughter the tailoring bills.”
Tariq Road also had more of something else … lots and lots of police, both regular police and traffic police. There were police mobiles, fork-lifters and tow trucks keeping a watch over. Any traffic violation would meet with a warning or action.
Police camps were also present to help the public. A little daughter was found roaming around on a footpath looking for her mother and brought to a camp to be promptly reunited with her frantic mother after several announcements on the public address system, someone double parked to give way to a lot of inconvenience for others. Quite deservedly he also faced inconvenience after his vehicle was towed away.
At the Gulf Shopping Mall in Clifton, most shoppers were found selecting jewellery. There was no shortage of shops selling their preferred items, too. Many ladies said that their Eid clothes were already sorted. Farhan Ali, shopkeeper selling cosmetics, and longingly looking at the rush around the jewellery shops, shared some wisdom with Dawn. “In my 16 years’ experience I have seen people shopping for clothes after the 20th fast, then comes time for footwear shopping, then jewellery and then cosmetics. It’s okay. I, too, will get my sweet fruit of patience,” he said.
At Jama Cloth Market, all shopkeepers were already getting their fruits of patience. There were shoppers in every shop and stall. The police had cordoned off the lane between the markets to keep cars from entering. Lines of rickshaws awaited passengers to shuttle them from here to there. So there was more walking involved, not that anyone minded that. Some footwear was slightly more expensive than in DHA’s Gold Mark so someone inquired the reason for it. “Those must be third or fourth copies of the original. We have here the first and second copies,” explained one footwear shopkeeper.
All these markets had shoppers from all segments of society unlike in the big air-conditioned malls where the rich shopped without worrying about their finances and the middle-class only window-shopped.
Out of all the busy markets in the city, Hyderi Market had to be the busiest by far. In fact, the hordes of people there were so closely pressed against each other that it was even difficult to move. Another thing seen here were the men. The other markets had very few men and mostly women shoppers. But here the women were with their husbands who helped build space for them in the crowds, carried the dozing babies on their shoulders or helped in carrying the many shopping bags. Still, the market was the most congested.
“Oh, I can’t breathe,” exclaimed one woman in the crowd. She was ushered by her husband to a quieter corner for a breather. Then after taking in several gulps of air, she looked around to decide where she wanted to go next. Then she dived back into the crowds for more Eid shopping.

10,ECP order to recount votes on PS-112 suspended,"The matter will be examined on Monday in view of the court’s interim order, says ECP official.","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday suspended an order of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) about the recount of votes of candidates on a provincial assembly seat, PS-112 (Keamari-II).
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-backed independent candidate Sirbuland Khan had secured 16,287 votes and won the election against Pakistan Peoples Party aspirant Asif Khan who got 10,784 votes.
The ECP had on April 1 ordered recounting of votes of 26 polling stations in the constituency.
An ECP official told Dawn that the recounting of votes was conducted on April 4 and PPP’s Asif Khan had emerged victorious.
In the meantime, the PTI candidate challenged the recounting order of the ECP before the SHC.
Advocate Ali Tahir argued that the petitioner had won the seat and had already taken oath as an MPA. Despite this, the ECP had ordered the returning officer (RO) for a recount on an application of rival candidate Asif.
The counsel submitted that the ECP had further asked the RO to complete the recounting process within three days and prepare Form-49 accordingly.
He stated that under Section 95(6) of the Election Act, 2019 the ECP had no jurisdiction to recount the votes after consolidation of the results.
After a preliminary hearing, a two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi ordered, “Let pre-admission notices be issued to respondents as well as advocate general Sindh and deputy attorney general, to be served through first three modes, for 18.04.2024, when comments/reply, if any, shall be filed with advance copy to the learned counsel for petitioner. In the meanwhile, the operation of the impugned order shall remain suspended till the next date.”
The ECP official told Dawn that the matter would be examined on Monday in view of the court’s interim order.

12,"KMC authorises KE to deduct service fee, Rs1.5bn dues from MUCT collection",Details hidden from public surface after KMC lawyer files in court document signed between civic entity and power utility,"KARACHI: An agreement between the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation and K-Electric that allows the latter to collect the controversial Municipal Utility Charges and Taxes (MUCT) for the KMC is designed in such a manner that the power utility is authorised to deduct a major chunk of the tax collection in the heads of its service fee, current month of KMC electricity bills and dues already outstanding against the corporation.
According to the agreement, the KMC has authorised the KE to deduct ‘at source’ 7.5 per cent service fee from the monthly MUCT collection. The KE is also authorised to deduct the monthly power bills of the KMC from such collection. The power utility is also entitled to deduct 50pc in the head of its outstanding electricity dues against KMC from the remaining monthly collection of the MUCT.
The information came to light on Friday when a lawyer for the KMC placed the agreement before the Sindh High Court in compliance with the court’s earlier order on a set of petitions filed against the provincial government’s move to outsource the MUCT to the KE.
The agreement, signed in June 2022, stated that the KMC acknowledged a total of Rs1.562 billion on account of outstanding electricity dues as on July 2022 and the same will be deducted by the KE at source in the manner prescribed in the agreement.

Details hidden from public surface after KMC lawyer files in court document signed between civic entity and power utility 

According to the agreement, the KE will collect MUCT from its domestic and non-domestic consumers of electricity through their monthly power bills on behalf of the KMC and to be charged as per consumer category as notified by the KMC from time to time.
The agreement states, “(a) KE to deduct at source 7.5% on total monthly collect of MUCT. (b) KE to deduct at sources KMC monthly electricity bills from monthly collection of MUCT. (c) After deduction of (a) and (b) from the monthly collection of MUCT, 50% from the remaining monthly collected MUCT amount shall be deducted against the outstanding electricity dues of KMC. After deduction of (a), (b) and (c), the remaining amount shall be transferred to the designated account of KMC.”
It stated that in case the processing of any bill of KE was delayed due to any reason beyond its control, the power utility would not be liable to make timely payment to the KMC.
The levy and collection of the MUCT did not extend to the jurisdiction of the respective cantonments within Karachi and if such tax was inadvertently charged from any consumer falling within the jurisdiction of cantonment boards the same will be corrected by the KE in its sole discretion, it added.
About termination of the agreement, it said that the power utility will have the right to terminate the agreement without assigning any reasons thereof by giving a 30-day advance written notice at any time.
The SHC will take up the matter again on April 24.
At a previous hearing, senior lawyer Munir A. Malik, who was appointed as amicus curiae to assist the SHC on the subject matter, had informed the court that the government was required to follow the contract rules and could not nominate KE to collect the MUCT for KMC through the electricity bills.
He added that under the relevant laws, the KE also may not use its coercive powers to collect such a tax.
In 2022, JI-Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman and others had filed separate petitions and submitted that after approval of the then Sindh chief minister, the chief secretary had issued a notification on Jan 21, 2022 allowing the provincial energy department and KMC to engage KE for collection of the MUCT under the Sindh Local Government Act (SLGA), 2013.
The petitioners further maintained in the petitions that the MUCT was imposed in the light of a resolution, passed by Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab, which was illegal and without following the provision of law.
In Sept 2022, the SHC through an interim order had restrained the power utility from collecting MUCT through electricity bills and appointed former attorney generals Mr Malik and Khalid Jawed Khan as amicus curiae to assist the court on the subject issue and advance their opinion.

13,People in Sindh express solidarity with Palestinians on Youm Al-Quds,"Muslim states urged to break ""criminal silence"" over Israeli atrocities.","KARACHI: Rallies and demonstrations were held across Sindh on Friday to mark Youm Al-Quds in solidarity with the people of Palestine and condemn the atrocities of Israel against the oppressed Arab nation, demanding strong reaction from the Muslim world for immediate help to the people in Gaza.
A large number of people, who attended the events across the province, also rejected the “so-called normalisation of terms with Israel” from the Islamic countries and warned the rulers of those states that their move could lead to devastating consequences.
In Karachi, the major rally was staged by the Imamia Students Organisation (ISO) from Numaish to Tibet Centre on M.A. Jinnah Road, attended by a large number of people, including women and children, vowing to continue their support for an independent Palestinian state with Al-Quds as its capital.
The key speakers at the rally included Hasan Arif of the ISO, Dr Mairajul Huda Siddiqi of the Jamaat-i-Islami, Shamim Naqvi of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and senior leaders of other political parties. 

Muslim states urged to break ‘criminal silence’ over Israeli atrocities 

Condemning the Israeli brutalities against the humanity, they also questioned the “criminal silence” of the world in general and Muslim countries in particular which has disappointed the faithful as an Ummah.
The Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) also staged demonstrations in different parts of the city in connection with Youm Al-Quds. The main protest by the party was held outside Jamia Masjid Noor Iman where Allama Baqir Abbas Zaidi, Allama Mubasher Hassan and Allama Hayat Abbas Najafi addressed the demonstrators.
“The history of Pakistan suggests that the countrymen and respective governments from those of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah to Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto agrees on this ideological point that Pakistan will never accept or recognise the illegitimate existence of Israel,” said Allama Zaidi in his address.
He lauded the freedom fighters of Palestine fighting against the Israeli occupation and asked the government of Pakistan to take a step forward and become party in the International Court of Justice against the war crimes of the Zionist state.
The Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) also expressed solidarity with Palestinians against the Israeli brutalities. A statement issued by the party said that dozens of protest demonstrations were held outside mosques in several areas after Friday prayers against Israel and its supporters across the world.
The participants, it said, carrying placards and banners, chanted slogans against the Zionist regime and its supporters. The party also collected “Gaza Fund” where people “donated generously for their brothers in Gaza”.
The speakers at the JI protests lambasted the Muslim world leaders for their “cowardice and dual face”, it said.
In Nawabshah and Naushahro Feroze, members of Shia Ulema Council, Majlis-i-Wahdatul Muslimeen, Imamia Students Organisation and Jafria Students Organisation took out processions to mark Yaum al-Quds on Friday.
Maulana Kifayat Hussain Karimi, Zawar Mohammad Hussain Chandio and others addressed participants in the processions and strongly condemned brutal Israeli attack on innocent Palestinians. Thousands of unarmed humans, including children and women, had been killed so far with complicity of United States, they said.
