The military's media wing said terrorists attempted to attack PNS Siddique in Turbat on the night of March 26. The attempt was foiled due to the “swift and effective response by the troops ensuring the safety and security of personnel and assets”.
The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), the most prominent of several separatist groups in Balochistan, claimed responsibility for the assault in a statement.
The martyred soldier was identified as 24-year-old Sepoy Noman Fareed from Muzaffargarh, serving with FC Balochistan.

1,Lawyer urges swift iddat case verdict,Court to resume Imran and wife’s appeals against sentence on 9th,"The lawyer representing former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, requested a court on Saturday to set aside the seven-year sentence handed down to his clients in the Iddat case before Eidul Fitr. However, the matter was postponed until April 9, likely the first day of Eid.
In February of this year, Senior Civil Judge Qudratullah sentenced the couple to seven years in jail, along with a fine of Rs500,000 each, for tying the knot during Bushra’s Iddat – a mandatory waiting period that a Muslim woman must observe on account of the death of her husband or dissolution of her marriage before she can remarry.
District and Sessions Judge Shahrukh Arjumand heard the couple’s appeals against the sentence on Saturday. The judge noted that the appeals had been largely heard but added that the complainant, Bushra's ex-husband Khawar Maneka, should also be given an opportunity to present his arguments. The court called for arguments from Maneka’s lawyer at the next hearing.

Salman Akram Raja, the lawyer representing the couple, argued that, according to the Supreme Court's decision, a marriage could take place 39 days after divorce. He further contended that 48 days had passed since Maneka divorced Bushra on January 1, 2018, when Imran and Bushra married.
Raja also emphasized that Imran and Bushra’s Nikah was not solemnized again in February 2018 but only a prayer ceremony was organized. He referred to verses in the Holy Quran’s Surah Al-Baqarah about Iddat and the SC verdict in the Rashida Akhtar case, stating that the court would have to adopt that judgment.
Additionally, Raja argued that Imran had already informed the trial court that the prayer ceremony was held after informing his sons about the Nikah. He asserted that there could be 10 ceremonies after the marriage.

Raja pointed out that Maneka had remained silent for six years after the marriage and highlighted Islam's encouragement for men to respect women’s privacy. He mentioned that Maneka himself had declared in a video message after the divorce that he had not seen a woman as pious as Bushra.
Furthermore, Raja stated that Imran had informed the trial court that his former confidante, Awn Chaundhry, was rewarded with a National Assembly ticket for testifying against him in the Iddat case. The court adjourned the hearing till April 9.
Similarly, the hearing of the £190 million scam reference against the couple was adjourned till April 17. During the hearing presided over by accountability court judge Nasir Javed Rana inside Adiala jail, the statement of one witness was recorded, and the initial statement of another witness was also recorded.
The defence lawyers completed the cross-examination of three witnesses and filed an application for Bushra’s medical examination and tests.

2,'K-P govt stands with security forces',Adviser to CM clarifies no cabinet meeting held at Peshawar's Corps Commander's House,"Waving away rumours, Adviser to the chief minister on information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif on Friday appeared to be striking a conciliatory tone, asserting that the provincial government – led by PTI – and the security forces had a united front against the security threats in the province.
""If we won't stand with our own army to safeguard our people's lives and properties, would we choose to ally with the Indian army?"" he questioned while addressing the media.
He quashed murmurs of a provincial cabinet meeting held at the Peshawar's Corps Commander's House, labelling them as nothing more than political smoke and mirrors.
Reflecting on the significance of collaboration between the government and security institutions, Saif stressed the shared responsibility in maintaining security.
He further expressed his commitment to proactive engagement and cooperation with the military, particularly in navigating the prevailing security challenges faced by the province.
Barrister Saif categorically denied any cabinet gathering and clarified that the cabinet members were invited to an Iftar dinner at XI Corps, a customary practice during Ramazan, which they accepted in accordance with Islamic traditions.
Following the Iftar, cabinet members were briefed on the prevailing security situation in the province.
Clarifying the venue choice, Saif said that 11 Corps have a specialised briefing room for security matters available, prompting the cabinet members' relocation.
Furthermore, the provincial information adviser underscored that the authority to call for a cabinet meeting rests solely with the chief minister, reiterating that no such meeting took place at the Corps Commander's House.
Saif elaborated on the events of the evening, highlighting a comprehensive security briefing followed by a question and answer session, which saw active participation from Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.
During his address, Gandapur shed light on the security landscape of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and governmental efforts in addressing pertinent issues.
Touching upon the border dynamics with Afghanistan, Saif stressed the heavy responsibilities borne by security agencies and pledged to work closely with them to safeguard the lives and property of the masses.
He said that in the face of such baseless allegations, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remains resolute in its commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of its citizens through collaborative efforts between the government and the security apparatus.
The advisor's clarification follows reports indicating the attendance of Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and provincial ministers at an Iftar event, where they received a comprehensive briefing on the peace and security landscape in the province.
According to these reports, an extensive discussion unfolded regarding the security scenario in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the aforementioned briefing.
Furthermore, it was noted in the reports that Imran Khan, the founder of the PTI, was fully briefed during the gathering, including the Iftar and subsequent briefing, wherein he expressed unwavering confidence in Ali Amin Gandapur.
However, it is important to highlight that on Thursday, circulating reports suggested that a cabinet session of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was convened at the Corps Commander House in Peshawar, where the provincial government provided military leadership with an overview of provincial affairs.

3,PBC wants IHC letter probe by serving judges,Lawyers file plea with SC seeking formation of full court on matter,"The Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) Executive Committee on Friday demanded the formation of a commission, comprising serving judges of the Supreme Court, to investigate into the letter written by six Islamabad High Court judges wherein they claimed that the country’s intelligence agencies were “meddling” in judicial affairs.
According to a statement, an Executive Committee meeting, chaired by the PBC vice chairman, reviewed the judges’ letter. It added that the participants of the huddle noted that judges were held in very high esteem by the people as they were responsible for deciding cases.
The statement read that demanding the resignation of the chief justice of Pakistan and IHC as well as the campaign against them on social media was “unnecessary”.
It continued that the moves were tantamount to strengthening the hands of those who wanted division in the judiciary.
A new application has been filed by the lawyers to seeking to become a party to the letter case and to form a full court on the matter.
Besides, six members of the PBC have also requested to become parties to the suo motu notice case concerning the letter.
On Tuesday, senior lawyer Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan and the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) moved the SC seeking its own investigation into the letter.
Last month, six judges of the IHC -- Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz -- penned a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), expressing their concerns about the ""interference"" of the intelligence agencies in the affairs of the court.

6,IHC questions curbs on inmate rights,The judge instructed the Islamabad advocate general to furnish relevant legal precedents on the issue,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has directed a state law officer to justify why restrictions should be placed on a prisoner's ability to express political opinions, considering that an ordinary citizen enjoys this right under the Constitution.
A single-member bench led by Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan issued this directive during the hearing of a petition challenging Section 265 of the Jail Rules, which prohibits political discussions by inmates.
Present in court were the petitioner, Sher Afzal Marwat Advocate, Islamabad Advocate General Iyaz Shaukat, and Court Assistant Zainab Janjua Advocate.
Justice Khan questioned, ""If individuals outside of prison face no constraints in expressing their political views, why should such limitations exist within prison walls?""

Court Assistant Zainab Janjua argued that it cannot be asserted that prisoners lack political rights as they retain the right to vote. The court adjourned the hearing until April 26.

7,Bilawal advises PTI to shun confrontation,PPP chief says contacts should be established so that politicians could work within institutions,"Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari advised the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) to develop an environment of cooperation instead of continuing with its old strategy of offensive tirades against the opponents in the assembly.
Speaking at an Iftar event in Larkana district on Friday, Bilawal said that together the parliamentarians could accomplish the goals of national reconciliation, a Charter of Economy and judicial reforms in the country.
“Even if political reconciliation can’t be achieved, at least some contacts should be established so that politicians may work within their limits and the institutions, work within their own limits,” he said, advising the opposition have a sense of its responsibilities.
He told the gathering that he felt sad when he saw mudslinging in parliament, where some politicians seem to be preoccupied with the issues of personal nature. He added that people elected lawmakers to represent them in parliament, and not to hurl abuses or indulge in ruckus there.
Bilawal underlined that the people of Pakistan did not give a clear majority to any party in the February 8 general election. “By doing so, they have given the message through their vote that the political parties, instead of fighting, should sit together and find solutions to the country’s problems.”
He asked the PPP’s members of the National Assembly and the provincial assemblies not to forget their electors, and feel the burden of the service. He reiterated that the Sindh government had been asked to hold public hearings in all districts of Sindh about the development projects.

8,UN projects over 2% GDP growth rate in Pakistan,Economic Survey predicts inflation to come down to 12.2% from 26% by next fiscal year,"The United Nations has projected accelerated economic growth, and reduction in inflation by more than half in Pakistan, in line with similar predictions made recently by the World Bank and other international financial institutions about the country.
The 2024 Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific region, released by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP) on Thursday, predicted real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 2% and 2.3% in the current and next fiscal years, respectively.
“In Pakistan, the economy faced political unrest that had adverse impacts on business and consumer sentiment while a massive flood disrupted agricultural production,” the survey said, adding that in the wake of fiscal pressure across the region Pakistan resorted to external assistance.
“In the case of Pakistan, the country secured an IMF [International Monetary Fund] agreement in mid-2023 which would help with further assistance from such bilateral partners as China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,” it noted.
The UN survey said that Pakistan's economic growth was accelerating in the current fiscal year 2023-24 and the real growth rate would increase by more than 2% in the next fiscal year, while the inflation rate was likely to decrease from the current 26% to 12.2% in the next fiscal.
UN-ESCAP said that despite the low tax levels, tax gaps in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were moderate and not necessarily small if measured as a share of current tax revenues rather than as a share of GDP.
“This suggests that better tax policies and administration alone may not help bridge the vast development financing gaps in low-tax countries. Overall improvements in socioeconomic development and public governance would be needed as well as tax revenue enhancement on a larger scale.”
Earlier, the World Bank had also made similar assessment of Pakistan’s economy, saying that GDP growth rate would increase and the inflation rate would some down. Besides the World Bank, Bloomberg reports had also confirmed that the “signs of economic stability in Pakistan are significant”.
About the Asia-Pacific region, the UN survey stressed that developing countries needed adequate and long-term resources and that they must choose whether to pay off their previous expensive debts or spending resources on education, health and social improvement of their peoples.

9,Extraterritorial killings by India need ‘coordinated response’,Foreign Office says terrorist acts inside Pakistan a clear violation of UN Charter,"The Foreign Office said on Friday said that the Indian network of extra-judicial and extra-territorial killings was now a “global phenomenon” and warned that India’s assassination of the Pakistanis on the Pakistani soil was a clear violation of the country’s sovereignty and a breach of the UN Charter.
The Foreign Office statement came a day after London-based daily newspaper, The Guardian, in a report detailed how the Indian government assassinated individuals in Pakistan, citing intelligence officials from both countries, as well as documents shared by Pakistani investigators.
The Foreign Office statement highlighted a press conference by Foreign Secretary Syrus Sajjad Qazi in January, in which he had said that there was “credible evidence” of links between Indian agents and the assassination of two Pakistani nationals in Sialkot and Rawalakot.
“These cases exposed the increasing sophistication and brazenness of Indian-sponsored terrorist acts inside Pakistan, with striking similarities to the pattern observed in other countries, including Canada and the United States,” the Foreign Office said.
“It is critical to bring to justice the perpetrators, facilitators, financiers and sponsors of these extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings. India must be held accountable internationally for its blatant violation of international law,” the Foreign Office added.
In October last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revealed that there was a link between Indian agents and the murder of a Sikh leader in Canada.
The next month, the US Justice Department had said an Indian government official directed an unsuccessful plot to assassinate a Sikh on US soil.
The Guardian report said that India had been publicly accused by Washington and Ottawa of involvement in the murders of activists on their soils, whom it considered hostile. It added that the fresh claims related to almost 20 killings since 2020, carried out by unidentified gunmen in Pakistan.
