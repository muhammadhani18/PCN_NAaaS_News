0,Setting up of car bazaar in Islamabad on the cards,"Sites in I-11 sector, Lehtrar Road proposed; showrooms to be housed on temporary basis","ISLAMABAD: City managers are planning to establish the first-ever dedicated car bazaar to facilitate car showroom owners, and two sites – one in I-11 sector and the other along Lehtrar Road –have been identified, sources said.
They said both options would be presented before the Capital Development Authority (CDA) board for final approval. However, the sources were of the view that the 33-kanal site along Lehtrar Road was congested compared to I-11 sector. Therefore, the CDA management is likely to opt for I-11 sector option.
“Both sites will be presented before the CDA board which will pick the better option,” an official of the planning wing said, adding that approximately 60 to 80 showrooms would be housed on the proposed site.
Earlier, a committee of CDA officials suggested that a dedicated car bazaar should be set up in the suburban area of Islamabad - on 33 kanals along Lehtrar Road. However, the CDA management was of the view that there were chances of traffic congestion on Lehtrar Road therefore the I-11 sector site should also be reviewed.

Sites in I-11 sector, Lehtrar Road proposed; showrooms to be housed on temporary basis

While explaining the need for establishing a dedicated showroom site, sources in the planning wing said the CDA had sealed showrooms operating on commercial plots due to non-conforming use in various Marakaz of the capital.
They said the operators of the showrooms had filed a writ petition with the Islamabad High Court, which decided in their favour and directed the civic agency to de-seal the showrooms. However, the sources said, the showrooms had occupied the parking lots in commercial areas, which caused inconvenience to various businesses.
The CDA chairman, therefore, directed the planning wing to identify sites exclusively for establishing car bazaars on temporary basis within the sectoral area of Islamabad.
The matter was then taken up in the CDA Board meeting on Oct 5, 2023, and the options of three sites, proposed by the planning wing, were deliberated upon. It was agreed that no permanent structure would be allowed at the site and car parking lot would be used purely on temporary basis. Uniform fibre design and demountable structures would only be allowed with 20pc covered area. The parking lots will be allocated through open auction on rental lease basis.
After due deliberation and information input on the summary, the board principally approved the proposals. However, for viable solution, the board formed a committee under the chairmanship of member planning and design, tasking it to submit a report within two weeks.
The sources said the committee had proposed setting up a car bazaar along Lehtrar Road, but the CDA management, after getting input from various stakeholders, insisted that the road was already a busy artery and setting up showrooms there would add to the traffic load. Therefore, the I-11 sector site was also suggested.
The sources said the matter was on the agenda of the next board meeting likely to be held in the next few days.
They said solar panels would be installed at the site to promote self-sustainable green energy solution to meet the energy requirements of the allocated space.
They further said to provide shelter from weather, entities might be allowed to erect solar panel-based shades, which would contribute to production of green energy and also fulfill the necessary shelter requirements.
According to the proposal, the space for showrooms will be offered on rent-based model, whereby the allottee would be required to pay a monthly rent to the CDA.

According to a notification issued by Establishment Division on April 4, “Tariq Salam, a BS-19 officer of Pakistan Administrative Services, presently serving as Member (Estate) Capital Development Authority under Interior Division, is transferred and directed to report to Establishment Division, with immediate effect and until further orders.”
Tariq Salam was appointed as member estate in September last year.
A few days ago, BS-19 officer of Secretariat Group Qaiser Khan Khattak, who was serving in CDA on deputation basis as DG HRD, was also transferred back to the Establishment Division before completing this three-year term.
However, sources said his services were required by his parent department, therefore, it was the prerogative of the Establishment Division to transfer him from the CDA. He was among the 20 deputation officers serving in CDA - the others are still working in the civic agency.
During his tenure, Mr Khattak played an instrumental role in getting several mega inquiries done in CDA amid a tussle with the land mafia, whereas he also remained active in deciding the years-long promotion and seniority cases of several officers. He had also started a campaign to remove paper mulberry trees from Islamabad, starting with F-9 Park.

3,Eid shopping sees dip in enthusiasm amid rising inflation,"RAWALPINDI: With a few days left for Eid, bazaars and markets in the garrison city appear to be buzzing with crowds...","RAWALPINDI: With a few days left for Eid, bazaars and markets in the garrison city appear to be buzzing with crowds of people, but for the city’s traders, there is a drop in business activity compared to previous years. And, they blame it on the reduced purchasing power of people.
Eid shopping remained dull in the first weeks of the holy month of Ramazan but it is now gaining momentum, but at stalls and small shops trading in readymade dresses, shoes, shirts, cosmetics and various other articles.
As far as businessmen with shops in main shopping malls are concerned, sales have dropped.
Shopping malls such as Zarkoon Plaza, Ghakar Plaza and Shahbaz Plaza on Bank Roadas well as in Chota Bazaar, Moti Bazaar, Bara Bazaar, China Market as well as Rabi Centre and Dubai Centre witnessed a slump in sales whereas smaller shops or stalls in Chota Bazaar, Moti Bazaar, Bara Bazaar and Commercial Market drew huge number of customers belonging to lower income groups. Affordable prices at these outlets are attracting buyers of limited means.
Vendors on the roadsides of busy roads and intersections are also doing brisk business this year as due to financial constraints, people of modest income have cut down their budget while the affluent section of the society has nearly completed their shopping.
Sheikh Umer, owner of a garment shop in Saddar, told Dawn that less activity had been witnessed in the bazaars as mostly people engaged in online shopping. “Most people visited the shops for window shopping,” he said, adding that in the past, they closed the shops late at night but this time they only work till 11pm.
A shopkeeper at Moti Bazaar, Junaid Saleem, said people had started visiting bazaars in the last two to three days, and that too late in the night to avoid traffic congestion.
Farkhanda Butt, a housewife, said that she did not like visiting the bazaar late at night but her children insisted as they enjoyed the hustle and bustle. “But, there is less activity in the market compared to past years; people do not have the budget to do Eid shopping this time around.”
Rawalpindi Cantonment Traders Association General Secretary Zafar Qadri told Dawn that this year less rush was witnessed in the markets for Eid shopping as purchasing power of people had reduced.
“There are two main reasons of less activity in Saddar this year - traffic and inflation. Less people visit the market in the last days of Ramazan as there is issue of parking. Besides, the cantonment authorities have dug up roads to carry out development work,” he added.

4,Four Paws is back to treat eight rescued bears in Islamabad,Animal welfare body says it aims to end illegal bear keeping practices in Pakistan.,"ISLAMABAD: In an important development for wildlife conservation, Four Paws, an international animal welfare organisation, has returned to Islamabad to provide crucial medical treatment to eight bears rescued since 2021.
On a five-day visit, Four Paws went to work immediately and put Aneela (female bear) under anesthesia to remove the nose ring and gave it a complete health check-up. About seven years old, Aneela had had the nose ring for five years and removing it required delicate procedure which was performed by Dr Frank Goritz, head veterinarian at Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin.
Four Paws returned on the urgent request of Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB). The team of veterinarians and wildlife experts will support the wildlife authorities with the treatment and neutering of eight resident bears at the rescue and rehabilitation centre (old Islamabad zoo). The team would also assist in planned rescue and relocation of new confiscated bears from bear baiting, dancing and breeding activities.
Teaming up with the IWMB came after Punjab Minister for Wildlife Maryam Aurangzeb ordered all wildlife departments to raid districts in Punjab and confiscate dancing bears. Aneela, the female bear, was confiscated by Gujranwala wildlife department and handed over to IWMB’s wildlife rescue centre for rehabilitation.

Animal welfare body says it aims to end illegal bear keeping practices in Pakistan

“Aneela was treated by expert veterinarians from Four Paws. She underwent a comprehensive medical examination during which the team removed a nose pin and treated broken teeth and injuries inflicted by poachers. Other injuries were identified and successfully treated, ensuring Aneela’s well-being and future health,” IWMB Chairperson Rina Saeed Khan told Dawn. 
According to the official, Four Paws was set to examine the remaining seven bears rescued by IWMB in coming days, providing them with the necessary medical attention and care. Four Paws had recommended establishing a permanent sanctuary for bears at the site of the old zoo, providing a safe and suitable environment for the rescued animals in the near future, she said. 
“They will now be working with IWMB to establish a permanent sanctuary at the site of the old zoo. This collaboration between Four Paws, IWMB and the Punjab Wildlife Department marks a significant step forward in wildlife conservation efforts in Pakistan. It highlights the importance of cooperation between governmental and non-governmental organisations in protecting and preserving the country’s precious wildlife,” she said.
Four Paws maintained that the cruel practices violated local animal welfare regulations and caused massive animal suffering. In cooperation with the Pakistani government, it aimed to end illegal bear keeping practices in the country.
After arriving at the rescue and rehab centre, the experts said they would examine and treat the bears already located at the rescue centre. The focus would be on implementing measures to prevent breeding among the rescued bears. The team would also provide recommendations to ensure the future high quality and species-appropriate care of all the bears. Moreover, Four Paws was awaiting a pending court decision that would decide the fate of four Asiatic black bear cubs in Punjab.
“It is crucial to assess the health of all bears and our priority to neuter them to prevent unwanted breeding. That way we can ensure ethical wildlife management going forward. We are grateful for the trust of the Pakistani authorities in our expertise and committed to improve the lives of as many bears as possible. We will also support the preparation of enclosures for the new arrivals at the rescue centre and ensure proper care for all animals going forward,” said Four Paws veterinarian Dr Amir Khalil, who leads the action in Pakistan.
IWMB’s rescue and rehabilitation centre is housing eight Asiatic black bears rescued from illegal private keeping as dancing bears.
“In our decades-long work to help exploited and abused bears around the world, we have seen the terrible suffering of bears mistreated for human entertainment such as baiting or dancing. Four Paws welcomes the action the Pakistani government is taking against such cruel practices, and we are happy to work together on this important cause. Our collaboration aims to find sustainable long-term solutions for the animals and help law enforcement to effectively put an end to the illegal practices of dancing bears and bear baiting in Pakistan,” said Josef Pfabigan, the CEO and president of Four Paws.
The IWMB chairperson said that her office was considering a forever home for the rescued Asiatic black bears at the rescue and rehab centre where there was ample space.  “These bears are captured as cubs and cannot be released back into the wild due to old age or injury – many die of starvation as they never learned how to hunt for food or had their claws and teeth removed,” she said.

5,Body formed to probe attack on food chain franchise in AJK,Six-member fact-finding committee to submit report within 15 days.,"MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government on Friday constituted a six-member fact-finding committee to probe the incident in which a mob attacked an international food chain franchise in the lakeside city of Mirpur and submit its report within 15 days.
Headed by senior minister Waqar Ahmed Noor, the committee includes cabinet members Chaudhry Qasim Majeed and Chaudhry Yasir Sultan, all hailing from Mirpur division, information secretary Ansar Yaqoob, deputy inspector general of Rangers and reserve police Dr Liaquat Ali and additional home secretary Surriya Khanum as members.
Ms Khanum would also act as secretary of the committee, which had been empowered to co-opt any other member, if required.
On March 29, a mob of around 250-300 people, chanting anti-Israel and pro-Palestine slogans, marched from a mosque to a street dotted with outlets of various Pakistani brands and some multinational fast-food franchises in Mirpur.
The fast-food restaurant franchise that was particularly targeted is owned by a local PML-N leader and former AJK minister Chaudhry Mohammad Saeed.
According to a notification issued by the services and general administration department here, the fact-finding committee would ascertain specific information about the threat to the property reportedly circulating on social media platforms prior to the attack.
In addition, it would find out that when the owner of the franchise had shared specific concern about possible attack on his property with the district administration a day before the actual incident, why was not that threat alert properly analysed and assessed, followed by due pre-emptive actions on the part of the concerned authorities.
Since a security order was also supposedly issued for handling such a situation, the committee would ferret out specific measures taken to ensure security of the property and handling of the mob.
The committee would also determine which official or authority was responsible for implementation of the security order, apart from digging out whether the security order was properly coordinated for implementation among the district administration, police and other relevant authorities.
The committee would also report about the level of supervisory coordination among the divisional heads of administration and police in Mirpur — the divisional commissioner and deputy inspector general of police.
It would identify the lapses in handling this incident at various levels and fix responsibilities.
Based on its findings, the committee would frame specific recommendations to address the lapses observed in handling such law and order situations in the future, the notification concluded.

9,Snow leopard habitat threatened by road construction: report,"ISLAMABAD: Rapid infrastructure development, primarily roads, potentially degraded the snow leopard habitat,...","ISLAMABAD: Rapid infrastructure development, primarily roads, potentially degraded the snow leopard habitat, disrupting the big cats’ movement and increasing human-wildlife conflict in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB).
This was revealed in a WWF-Pakistan’s baseline research study undertaken through a project, ‘Building ecological and sustainable transport/linear infrastructure for now leopards in the Hindu Kush Karakoram Himalaya landscape in Pakistan (BEAST)’.
The project was supported by With Snow Leopards Small Grant (SLSG) initiated by Tencent Foundation and Shan Shui Conservation Centre with support from Huatai Foundation, Amity Foundation and Pecking University Centre for Nature and Society.
The study said prey species of the snow leopard such as the Himalayan ibex and domestic livestock were also killed due to heavy traffic on highways. It recommended striking a balance between boosting infrastructure development and conservation of threatened wildlife such as snow leopards in the region.
The report stated that the GB region was home to diverse wildlife, including vulnerable snow leopards, pointing out that the linear infrastructure development that cut through the landscape such as roads had fragmented the snow leopard habitat and their prey species.
The study gathered evidence on infrastructure-related threats to snow leopards and their habitat in GB. It collected data on wildlife-vehicle collisions, investigated the impact of increasing infrastructure on human-wildlife interaction and analysed land use changes in known snow leopard hotspots over the past 20 years.
It covered two major roads – Karakoram Highway (KKH) and Gilgit-Shandur Road – which bisect snow leopard habitat. In the backdrop of the surging infrastructure growth in the region, WWF-Pakistan launched the sustainable infrastructure initiative in 2019 aimed at building the capacities of relevant stakeholders, raising awareness and advocating for sustainable and green infrastructure planning and development in the Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) region.
Commenting on the study, WWF-Pakistan Director General Hammad Naqi Khan said infrastructure development projects helped boost trade and tourism but they should not overlook the environmental and species conservation aspects.
He noted that the detrimental impacts of the development projects could be avoided through meticulous planning, sustainable infrastructure, and an integrated approach that promotes biodiversity conservation and protection of the natural ecosystem.
The report indicated that large-scale transport infrastructure development and burgeoning hospitality projects had posed a threat to the local biodiversity and pristine landscape in GB.
It proposed that following the current laws regulating wildlife, linear development, and human encroachment should be prohibited in the protected areas. It also recommended that the construction of wildlife corridors and crossings in potential wildlife habitats could help minimise the access of wildlife to high-traffic roads and could reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions.
It suggested that the deployment of devoted law enforcement and traffic personnel along wildlife hotspots could help thwart the hunting and poaching of snow leopards and their prey species. Besides, infrastructure-related development projects should take proactive mitigation steps to safeguard the native ecology and wild species.
Various studies indicated that the snow leopard was an elusive animal, and it was difficult to record its exact population in the distribution range across Central and South Asia. However, in 2020, WWF research indicated that fewer than 7,000 snow leopards remained globally of which approximately 200 to 420 inhabited the northern mountain ranges of Pakistan, including GB, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK).

PTI candidate Chaudhry Umair Wasi Zafar was declared the winner with a lead of about 4,000 votes and the notification of his success was also issued. However, on the application of the losing PML-N candidate, Khan Bahadar Dogar, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) ordered a recount, which was held on March 12 at the ECP office in Faisalabad. Following the recount of vote, the PML-N candidate turned out to be the winner.
After the conclusion of the Feb 8 general election and the consolidation process on Feb 10, Chaudhry Umair Wasi Zafar was declared winner with 48,928 votes. His rival, Khan Bahadur Dogar, obtained 44,433 votes as per Form-47.
The Election Commission notified the election results, following which Umair Wasi Zafar took oath as member of the Punjab Assembly on Feb 22.
In the meantime, Dogar filed an application with the ECP, contending that the consolidation proceedings had been conducted in his absence. The said application was decided and the returning officer was directed to recount the votes, including rejected ones, in the presence of the applicant and other contesting candidates within three days.
Justice Imtiaz heard the counsels for petitioner Umair Wasi Zafar, Khan Bahadur Dogar and the ECP and concluded that the petitioner “has failed to point out any illegality or infirmity or jurisdictional defect in the Impugned Order”.
“It is also not out of place to mention that recount has taken place since the filing of the instant writ petition. The petitioner has invoked the equitable jurisdiction of this court but has not pointed out any error in the result of such recount whereby the Respondent No. 3 [Dogar] has been declared the successful candidate nor has the petitioner instituted any legal proceedings before any other forum to challenge the same,” the court order said.

11,Rallies call for Muslim unity against Israeli aggression,"ISLAMABAD: Like other parts of the country, Al Quds Day was observed in Islamabad and Rawalpindi with...","ISLAMABAD: Like other parts of the country, Al Quds Day was observed in Islamabad and Rawalpindi with religio-political parties taking out rallies and calling for Muslim unity against the aggression of Israel. 
The main rally in the federal capital was held from G-6 to D-Chowk while Jamaat-i-Islami also took out a rally at Aabpara Chowk in solidarity with the people of Palestine.
The announcement to observe the last Friday of Ramazan as the day for liberation of Al Quds and highlight the sufferings of the Palestinians was made by the founder of Islamic revolution of Iran Ayatollah Khomeni in early 1980s.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman and newly-elected Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas in his speech at the Al Quds rally said Israel had been defeated in Gaza. 
“Despite all might and the backing from the world powers, the spirit of Palestine is high and despite months of relentless bombings and media propaganda no one is accepting Israel’s narrative.” He said it had been proven that Israel was terrorist and murderer of innocent women and children.
“Israel has been disgraced at every forum and if it would not have been for US and Nato international sanctions would have been imposed on Israel,” he added.
Mr Abbas said today Israel was fighting for its survival and surviving on the backing of Western powers, but the masses in those countries were observing the International Day of Al-Quds. 
The rally was also attended by women and children and the participants burnt the flags of America and Israel.
The Al Quds Day was also observed in the National Press Club on the last day of a Ramazan family festival. The NPC office-bearers and guests slammed Israel for blatant violation of international laws and killing scores of media persons.
NPC President Azhar Jatoi and Secretary Nayyar Ali expressed solidarity with the media community of Palestine and condemned the Israeli brutality against civilians in Gaza. Prayers were held for the people of Palestine.
Rawalpindi 
In Rawalpindi, the main procession was taken out from Imambargah Ashiq Hussain Teli Mohallah under the auspices of District Youm Al Quds Himayat Mazloomin Committee of Tehreek Nifaz Fiqa-i-Jafrriya (TNFJ).
The procession was led by Shaukat Abbas Jaffri, central convener of TNFJ; Syed Farzand Ali Kazmi, Allama Syed Shabih-i-Hassan Kazmi, Allama Syed Mohsin Ali Hamdani and others. The participants were carrying banners and placards inscribed with slogans in favour of Al Quds and against the American-Zionist-Hindu colonial trio.
The rally turned into a public gathering after reaching Committee Chowk. 
A resolution adopted on the occasion said though Muslim states were gifted with wealth and mineral resources, colonial powers had made the life of Muslims miserable. Kashmir and Palestine have been under the occupation of Hindus and Zionists for decades.
The resolution lamented that the United Nations resolutions did nothing for the subjugated people of Kashmir and Palestine. The Muslim Ummah has lost its identity because most of their rulers are following the colonial agenda just to grab or prolong power, the resolution said. 
Attock
MWM also took our rallies in Attock and Taxila to express solidarity with the people of Palestine.
The protesters were carrying banners and holding placards inscribed with slogans against Israel which has been committing atrocities against the people of Palestine.
Speakers urged the international community to take notice of the Israeli atrocities. 
A rally was taken out from Imambargah Hussainia under the banner of Muhafiz-i-Quds Committee in Attock. Workers of different political parties, human rights organisations, religious groups and human rights organisations participated in the rally.
Addressing the participants, MWM Attock President Maulana Niaz Bukhari called for Muslim unity and joint struggle for the emancipation of the world from the subjugation of colonial powers and Al Quds from the Israeli occupation.
Tahafuz-i-Azadari district president Syed Tehseen Naqvi said the late Imam Khomeini had initiated the Quds Day as an integral part of the holy month of Ramazan so that Muslims would never forget their responsibility and duty towards Palestine and all oppressed people in the world. 
President Anjuman Jan Nisaran-i-Hussain Syed Raza Haider Naqvi said the struggle of Muslims will continue till the abolition of the discriminatory policies towards Muslims.
In Taxila, a rally was taken out from Imambargah Fatimia Hattar Road that concluded at Taxila Chowk. The protesters torched flags of US and Israel and chanted slogans against them. Special prayers were offered for the liberation of Palestine. — Amjad Iqbal in Taxila also contributed to this story
