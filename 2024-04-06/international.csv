“A kamikaze drone attacked a military base of the ministry of defence of the Transnistrian Moldovan Republic in the district of Rybnitsa, six kilometres from the Ukraine border,” the ministry for state security in the self-declared breakaway region said in a communique.
“The target was a radar station that suffered minor damage. A group of investigators is on site,” it added, without directly blaming Ukraine.
On March 17, Transnistria claimed that a drone fired from Ukraine hit a military base in its capital Tiraspol, accusations that Moldova denounced as an attempt to provoke panic.
Meanwhile, Ukraine had accused Russia of being behind the attack with the aim of destabilising Moldova.

1,Bosnia remembers  Sarajevo victims with shoe trail,"SARAJEVO: Thousands marched through Sarajevo on Friday following a “memory” path made up of over 11,500 pairs of...","SARAJEVO: Thousands marched through Sarajevo on Friday following a “memory” path made up of over 11,500 pairs of shoes, each representing a victim of the siege of the Bosnian capital which started 32 years ago.
The commemoration began with a tribute to several hundred children killed during the 44-month siege, with youngsters laying flowers around a monument in the city centre.
“Behind each pair of shoes is a lost life,” Ahmed Kulanic, director of the Sarajevo Memorial Centre, told reporters.
Only the funeral music of trumpets from a balcony could be heard as cars stopped for half an hour on the city’s main road.
Participants proceeded down one of Sarajevo’s main streets towards the old town, passing 1.5 kilometres of rows of shoes belonging to children, men, women and soldiers.
The shoes were donated by local residents and will later form a memorial exhibit that is currently under construction, Kulanic added.
Over 11,000 people were killed and more than 50,000 injured by Bosnian Serb forces during the siege, the longest in the history of modern warfare, according to official figures.
“I had forgotten the day when I unconsciously let a tear roll down my cheek. And now, this morning, it has happened,” Zlatko Dizdarevic, editor-in-chief of the award-winning daily Oslobodjenje during the siege, said.
The exhibition “makes me understand how we forget certain extremely important things that determined our lives”, Dizdarevic added.
For Sarajevo’s mayor Benjamina Karic, commemorating the start of the siege is about “building a culture of remembrance” and “teaching” young people “what happened in Sarajevo and Bosnia, so that they can appreciate the value of peace and freedom”.
“We want to send a message of peace, we want to send a message to Europe and to the world that we do not want any more children to be killed in the year 2024 in Gaza or Ukraine,” said Karic, who was born a year before the siege of Sarajevo began. Bosnia’s 1992-1995 war claimed over 100,000 lives.

2,Meta to start using ‘Made  with AI’ labels next month,"Would also apply more prominent labels to digitally altered media posing “particularly high risk of materially deceiving public"".","NEW YORK: Facebook owner Meta announced major changes to its policies on digitally created and altered media on Friday, ahead of US elections poised to test its ability to police deceptive content generated by new artificial intelligence technologies.
The social media giant will start applying “Made with AI” labels next month to AI-generated videos, images and audio posted on its platforms, expanding a policy that previously addressed only a narrow slice of doctored videos, Vice President of Content Policy Monika Bickert said in a blog post.
Bickert said Meta would also apply separate and more prominent labels to digitally altered media that poses a “particularly high risk of materially deceiving the public on a matter of importance”, regardless of whether the content was created using AI or other tools.
The new approach will shift the company’s treatment of manipulated content. It will move from one focused on removing a limited set of posts toward one that keeps the content up while providing viewers with information about how it was made.
Meta previously announ­ced a scheme to detect images made using other companies’ generative AI tools using invisible markers built into the files, but did not give a start date at the time.
A company spokesperson said the new labelling approach would apply to content posted on Meta’s Facebook, Instagram and Threads services. 
Meta will begin applying the more prominent  “high-risk” labels immediately, the spokesperson said.
Impact on elections 
The changes come months before a US presidential election in November that tech researchers warn may be transformed by new generative AI technologies. Political campaigns have already begun deploying AI tools in places like Indonesia, pushing the boundaries of guidelines issued by providers.
In February, Meta’s oversight board called the company’s existing rules on manipulated media “incoherent” after reviewing a video of US President Joe Biden posted on Facebook last year that altered real footage to wrongfully suggest he had behaved inappropriately.
The footage was permitted to stay up, as Meta’s existing  “manipulated media” policy bars misleadingly altered videos only if they were produced by artificial intelligence or if they make people appear to say words they never actually said.

3,Congress pledges to ‘protect minorities’ if voted back to power,"“It’s a close election and we are going to fight an excellent election and we are going to win the election,” says Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi.","NEW DELHI: India’s main opposition party Congress vowed in its manifesto released on Friday to protect religious minorities — generally seen as a reference to Muslims — and backward castes through “affirmative action”, meaning reservations in jobs and admissions if voted to power after elections.
Congress, which had ruled India for more than 50 years with centre-left policies, has struggled in the past decade to compete with Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which counts the country’s Hindu majority as its main vote base.
The seven-phase election starts on April 19, with vote counting on June 4.
 
 

More help for so-called backward castes and the poor irrespective of caste were among Congress pledges in its election manifesto, including assured jobs for the young, guaranteed prices for farm produce and higher health insurance payouts.
“Congress has been the most vocal and active champion of the progress of the backward and oppressed classes and castes over the last seven decades,” said the manifesto released by party president Mallikarjun Kharge, who himself is from one of India’s most backward castes.
“However, caste discrimination is still a reality.”
Kharge listed some of the key pledges with only a feeble response from party workers at a press conference, leading him to comment: “No claps, nothing!”
Many analysts say morale is low in Congress because of the BJP’s dominance of the country’s politics. An opinion poll released on Wednesday predicted Modi’s National Democratic Alliance coalition could win 399 of the 543 seats in the lower house of parliament while the BJP alone is projected to win 342.
Congress could fall to 38 seats, a record low, it said.
Close election
Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said the election is  “much closer than being propagated”.
“It’s a close election and we are going to fight an excellent election and we are going to win the election,” he said at the event.
Should it be voted back to power, Congress said it would conduct a socio-economic and caste census to  “strengthen the agenda for affirmative action”, guaranteeing a constitutional amendment to raise the 50 per cent cap on reservations for backward castes in government jobs and education.
The party said such groups make up nearly 70 per cent of India’s 1.42 billion people, but “their representation in high-ranking professions, services and businesses is disproportionately low”.
The caste system has set out hierarchies in the Hindu religion for thousands of years, but it has been countered by affirmative action policies in recent decades albeit with uneven effect.
Average monthly spending by marginalised castes from so-called scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and other backward classes lagged privileged castes by 27 per cent in rural and 30 per cent in urban India in 2022/23, according to a government survey released last month.

“In a written message, the Islamic Republic of Iran warns US leadership not to get dragged in Netanyahu’s trap. Stay away so you won’t get hurt. In response US asked Iran not to target American facilities,” Iranian presidential aide Mohammad Jamshidi said on X on Friday.

5,Bollywood film panned for maligning Muslims,"“Secular Kerala will stand united in resisting such subversive attempts aimed at fostering communal discord,” Kerala’s chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.","MUMBAI: A Bollywood film about young Indian women recruited by the militant Islamic State group has sparked renewed controversy before India’s elections, with the opposition saying its screening on national TV could “sow seeds of religious animosity”.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is widely expected to win multi-phase national elections that begin on April 19, partly thanks to his consistent wooing of the majority community.
The BJP has also fielded many actors in the elections, votes from which will be counted on June 4.
But Bollywood’s involvement in the election took a complicated turn on Friday night when The Kerala Story, set in the southern coastal state of the same name that is run by an opposition party, was aired on government-owned national broadcaster Doordarshan.
The small-budget movie, a surprise hit since its release last summer, follows three women who are indoctrinated and convert to Islam from Hinduism and are then sent to IS camps in Afghanistan.
Critics say the film incites negative sentiments against India’s Muslim community.
As Doordarshan is free for consumers, the channel reaches many homes right across the country.
“Doordarshan is not an agency to undertake communal campaigns for BJP candidates,” Kerala’s chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, said in a statement regarding the airing of the film.
“Secular Kerala will stand united in resisting such subversive attempts aimed at fostering communal discord.” 
The Congress party also spoke out against the airing.
The federal ministry for information and broadcasting, which runs Doordarshan, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A BJP minister said the screening had nothing to do with politics.
“A movie is a piece of art and the expression of art is guaranteed in the constitution,” V. Muraleedharan, a junior foreign minister who is also from Kerala, told reporters.
The BJP has little presence in many southern Indian states like Kerala but is keen to win more seats there in its bid to secure more than 400 in total for its coalition out of the 543 seats in the lower house of parliament.
The movie, which Modi has praised publicly, is among a string of Bollywood films released since last year and which have appealed to BJP’s Hindu nationalist base.
In the run-up to the vote, several nationalistic films,  including a biopic on Hindu ideologue Vinayak Savarkar,  have been released in theatres this year.
“Things are changing,” Randeep Hooda, who directed, produced and acted in the biopic, said. “It’s a different country; these are different times and therefore there are different movies being made,” he said, adding:  “Nationalistic films have done well in the past.” 
Another film, The Sabarmati Report, focuses on an incident where a suspected Muslim mob set fire to a train carrying Hindu pilgrims in Gujarat in 2002, sparking one of India’s worst riots since 1947.
It is due to be released next month, in the middle of the nationwide voting period.

6,Prosecutors interrogate Peru’s president over Rolex scandal,"LIMA: Peruvian President Dina Boluarte on Friday appeared before prosecutors for questioning over her Rolex watches,...","LIMA: Peruvian President Dina Boluarte on Friday appeared before prosecutors for questioning over her Rolex watches, expensive jewellery, and unexplained bank deposits, in a scandal that has shaken the country’s fragile government.
Attorney General Juan Carlos Villena “initiated the process of taking statements” from Boluarte, who has been ordered to present the undeclared luxury timepieces to investigators, his office wrote on X. She has also been asked to produce receipts and explain the origin of her valuables as part of the probe into illegal enrichment.
The questioning could last several hours and comes after the police raided her home and presidential office on March 30 in search of the alleged collection, which is said to include three high-value Rolex watches, according to photographs published by local media.
The government hopes Boluarte’s statement will put an end to a scandal that provoked two motions to impeach her, both defeated by the right-wing majority in Congress on Thursday.
“I presume that after this explanation there will be no choice for the prosecutor’s office but to close this investigation,” Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzen said on Thursday.
He said Boluarte “will know how to explain what happened”. The attorney general is also seeking an explanation for Boluarte’s possession of a “$56,000 Cartier bracelet” and other jewellery valued at more than $500,000. Bank deposits of about $250,000 from her time as a minister in 2021 and 2022 are also being investigated.

7,Russian forces  step up pressure in Ukraine’s east,"“If before there were moments when you could hear silence in the town, now there is no silence […] There is constant fire,” says the head of the Chasiv Yar military administration Sergiy Chaus.","KRAMATORSK: Ukraine warned on Friday that a key frontline town was coming under “constant fire” from advancing Russian troops as Moscow said it had captured another small village.
Russia’s advances on the battlefield came as Ukraine said it had destroyed at least six military planes at a Russian airbase in one of its largest overnight drone attacks in weeks.
Buoyed by their advantage in manpower and arms, Russian forces are on the offensive.
The Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar in the eastern Donetsk region appears to be their next major target.
“The town has become even more dangerous,” the head of the Chasiv Yar military administration, Sergiy Chaus, said on Friday during an interview in the nearby city of Kramatorsk.
“If before there were moments when you could hear silence in the town, now there is no silence… There is constant fire,” he said.
Both Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers with links to the armed forces said on Friday that Russian troops had reached the outskirts of the town.
Chaus declined to comment on those reports. He said there were around 770 people still living there.
“There is not a single building left intact,” he added. Chasiv Yar is an important logistics hub for Kyiv’s forces and sits a few kilometres west of Bakhmut, which was flattened by months of artillery fire before it was captured by Russia last May.
Russia has recently secured its first territorial gains since seizing Bakhmut and is now trying to press onwards against Ukrainian units hobbled by delays in the supply of vital Western military aid.
Further to the south, Russia’s military claimed on Friday to have captured the small village of Vodiane, on the outskirts of Donetsk city.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday that his forces had “managed to stabilise our positions” and had halted Russian advances, despite a  “shortage of shells and a significant slowdown in supplies”.

8,"Israel admits errors in strike on aid workers, fires two army officers",World Central Kitchen demands an independent commission to investigate the incident.,"JERUSALEM: The Israeli military dismissed two officers and formally reprimanded senior commanders on Friday after an inquiry into the killing of seven aid workers in an air strike in Gaza this week found serious errors and breaches of procedure.
The inquiry found Israeli forces mistakenly believed they were attacking Hamas fighters when drones hit the three vehicles of the World Central Kitchen aid group late on Monday night, and that standard procedures had not been followed.
“The strike on the aid vehicles is a grave mistake stemming from a serious failure due to a mistaken identification, errors in decision-making, and an attack contrary to the standard operating procedures,” the military said in a statement issued on Friday.
The killing of the seven aid workers, who included citizens of Britain, Australia and Poland, a dual US-Canadian national and a Palestinian colleague, stirred global outragethis week.
In a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, US President Joe Biden threatened a shift in US policy towards Israel unless it reduced harm to civilians in Gaza, which had depended on aid even before the war. Hunger has spread since fighting began six months ago.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday Washington was carefully reviewing Israel’s inquiry and would look very carefully at what steps Israel was taking.
“It’s very important that Israel is taking full responsibility for this incident. It’s also important that it appears to be taking steps to hold those responsible accountable. Even more important is that steps are being taken going forward to ensure that something like this can never happen again,” Blinken told reporters in Brussels.
After publication of the findings, World Central Kitchen demanded an independent commission to investigate the incident.  “Without systemic change, there will be more military failures, more apologies and more grieving families,” said a statement published by WCK.
The Israeli army (IDF) had already acknowledged that the seven WCK employees were killed in an air strike but the unusually swift investigation underlined the impact the incident has had on world public opinion.
Jose Andres, the chef who founded World Central Kitchen, said this week the seven workers had been targeted  “systematically, car by car” as they scrambled to seek shelter when their vehicles were hit in succession.
The military said it had dismissed a brigade chief of staff with the rank of colonel and a brigade fire support officer with the rank of major, and formally reprimanded senior officers, including the general at the head of the Southern Command.
The case was also handed over to the military advocate general to consider a possible criminal investigation, the military said.
200 tons of food
The convoy hit was the second of four planned missions to deliver some 200 tons of food brought to Gaza by sea last month under WCK management as part of efforts to increase the amount of aid getting into Israeli-besieged Gaza.
The military said that as the aid convoy which the light vehicles were accompanying was travelling down the coastal road in Gaza towards a logistics point late on Monday, armed suspects had climbed onto at least one of the trucks.
The army showed reporters drone footage of a man on top of a lorry firing a rifle, which a spokesperson said had prompted the military to try, unsuccessfully, to contact WCK coordinators.

9,"Iran pays homage to fighters killed in Syria strike, vows revenge",TEHRAN: Thousands of people chanted against Israel and the United States at Friday’s funeral for seven Iranian...,"TEHRAN: Thousands of people chanted against Israel and the United States at Friday’s funeral for seven Iranian Revolutionary Guards, two them generals, who were killed in an air strike in Syria, which Iran blamed on Israel.
Guards chief General Hossein Salami warned that Israel “cannot escape the consequences” of Monday’s strike, which levelled the five-storey consular annex of the Iranian embassy in Damascus.
Israel has not commented on the strike, but analysts saw it as an escalation of its campaign against Iran and its regional proxies that runs the risk of triggering a wider war beyond the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip.
Friday’s ceremony coincided with annual Quds (Jerusalem) Day commemorations, when Iran and its allies organise marches in support of the Palestinians.
Quds Day rallies also took place in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain while in Lebanon the head of the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement delivered a speech.
Iran has said among the dead were two brigadier generals from the Guards’ foreign operations arm, the Quds Force, Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi and Mohammad Reza Zahedi.
A Britain-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Zahedi, 63, was the Quds Force commander for the Palestinian Territories, Syria and Lebanon.
He had held several commands during a career spanning more than 40 years, and was the top Iranian soldier killed since a United States missile strike at Baghdad airport in 2020 killed General Qassem Soleimani, who headed the Quds Force.
The coffins of the seven were placed on the trailers of two trucks in one of the largest squares in Tehran.
Israel ‘will be punished’ 
Mourners held Iranian, Palestinian flags and Hezbollah flags, chanting “Death to Israel!” end  “Death to America!”.
Ziyad al-Nakhalah, leader of Palestinian group Islamic Jihad which fights alongside Hamas in Gaza, attended the funeral, Iran’s Fars news agency reported. President Ebrahim Raisi and his predecessor Hassan Rouhani were also present.
Guards chief Salami said Tehran was determined to make Israel pay for the raid. “The Zionist regime cannot escape the consequences of the harm it does,” he said, adding: “It is exposed and knows very well what is going to happen.” Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Israel “will be punished” for the killings.
Israel said Thursday it was strengthening its defences and pausing leave for combat units following Iran’s threats to retaliate.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Iran would inevitably retaliate.

10,French schoolboy  dies after assault,"PARIS: A French schoolboy died on Friday from wounds sustained in a violent assault, as President Emmanuel ...","PARIS: A French schoolboy died on Friday from wounds sustained in a violent assault, as President Emmanuel Mac­r­on warned schools should be protected from  “uninhibited violence” among some youths.
The 15-year-old teenager was badly beaten Thursday near his school in a town south of Paris and rushed to hospital following a cardiac arrest. 
He died of his wounds early on Friday afternoon, a prosecutor said.
It was the second such assault this week, after a 13-year-old girl was left temporarily comatose after being attacked outside her school in the southern city of Montp­ellier on Tuesday.
“We have a form of uninhibited violence am­­ong our teenagers and sometimes among increasingly younger ones,” Macron said earlier in the day before the teenager died, as he visited a primary school in Paris.
In the latest beating, several people attacked the 15-year-old as he left school Thursday afternoon in a low-income district of Viry-Chatillon, a town around 20 kilometres south of Paris.
The schoolboy suffered cardiorespiratory arrest, according to a police source, leading to his death the following day.
Police on Friday afternoon detained a 17-year-old as part of a probe into murder and gang assault.
