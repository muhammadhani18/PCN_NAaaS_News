0,Government borrows record Rs4.7tr from banks,Analysts predict Rs7tr accumulation by June; advances to private sector plunge by 70pc.,"KARACHI: The government’s borrowing from banks reached Rs4.7 trillion, with an addition of Rs700 billion within the last two months.
The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) latest data showed that the government borrowed Rs4.69tr during July-March, marking record borrowings during the current financial year.
The huge borrowing has already sidelined the private sector, as the sector’s borrowing fell by 70 per cent, making it a hard time for economic growth.
Despite significant revenue collections, the record borrowing indicates excessive spending by the government without consideration for the cost of borrowing. The government is borrowing at record-high rates.

Analysts predict Rs7tr accumulation by June; advances to private sector plunge by 70pc

In the previous auction held on Wednesday, the government increased the six-month T-bills rate by 100 basis points to 21.39pc. Most of the borrowings have been made at the same rate during the fiscal year FY24.
The caretaker government had already set a record by borrowing Rs4tr, but the new government could not stop this borrowing trend. From Jan 19 to March 22, the government’s borrowings were Rs700bn.
In FY22 and FY23, total government borrowings from banks were Rs3.448tr and Rs3.716tr, respectively.
Some analysts believe that the current borrowing trend could lead to a total of around Rs6.5tr to Rs7tr by the end of June 2024. The government has been increasing energy prices to generate more revenue, but the borrowing from banks shows that the revenue being generated is not enough to meet the spending requirements.
The reckless borrowing has not only increased debt servicing, which accounts for almost 50pc of the budget outlay, but has also slashed public sector development funds (PSDP). The reduced spending for PSDP has slowed down economic growth.
The growth rate was negative in FY23, and the current trend indicates that growth could be similar to the previous year. The private sector has been relying on its own resources to continue at the minimum level, while domestic investment has decreased to an insignificant level.
The country’s economy has been experiencing the lowest growth in the region, with the highest inflation still around 27pc during the first nine months of the fiscal year FY24. Inflation has begun to decrease over the last three months, but the interest rate remains at 22pc, the main reason for extremely low private sector borrowings. Some experts were certain that the interest rate would see a significant cut in the next monetary policy scheduled at the end of this month.
The trade and industry have been urging for several months to lower the interest rate as it has made the cost of doing business too high. However, the central bank’s main target is inflation. In order to counter high inflation, the SBP has kept the interest rate unchanged at 22pc during FY24.

1,Yellen calls Beijing’s industrial might ‘threat’ to global economy,"""Western nations have been doing that for centuries, when it comes to China, it becomes an ‘overcapacity problem’ threatening the world,” says Chinese state media.","GUANGZHOU: US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Friday that concerns are growing over the global economic fallout from China’s excess manufacturing capacity, making the issue the main focus of four days of economic meetings with Chinese officials.
China is too large to export its way to rapid growth and would benefit by reducing excess industrial capacity which is pressuring other economies, Yellen said in remarks to an audience of about 40 representatives of the American Chamber of Commerce in Guangzhou.
“Overcapacity isn’t a new problem, but it has intensified, and we’re seeing emerging risks in new sectors,” Yellen said in China’s southern export hub of Guangzhou, where she met with Vice Premier He Lifeng and Guangdong Province Governor Wang Weizhong.
Yellen and other Biden administration officials are growing increasingly concerned about China’s overproduction of electric vehicles, solar panels, semiconductors and other goods that are flooding into global markets in the face of a demand slump in China’s domestic market.
She said that this is not healthy for China and is hurting producers in other countries, urging Beijing to shift away from state-driven investment and return to the market-oriented reforms that fuelled growth in past decades.
Financial cooperation
While Sino-US tensions over a range of issues have been escalating, Yellen highlighted areas of mutual interest in a dialogue launched during her first visit to China last July, including fighting climate change and illicit finance.
She said a financial working group representing both sides had been working on steps to contain the financial risks from a potential bank failure in either economy.
“We’ve held technical exchanges between our sides, including an exercise on how we would jointly deal with the failure of a large bank in the US or in China,” Yellen said, without providing additional detail on the findings of that review.
China has set an ambitious economic growth target of five per cent for 2024, fuelled in part by more investment in new high-technology sectors as the economy struggles to overcome a property crisis and weak consumer demand. But many economists say China’s growth model needs a major overhaul to boost domestic consumption and reduce its traditional heavy reliance on investment.
Yellen started her meeting on Friday with He by saying the two countries needed to communicate closely on difficult issues such as overcapacity and national security-related economic restrictions.
“It is what the world and our citizens expect from us,” she said.
Tariff groundwork
Some trade experts see the increased US criticism of China’s production-focused, subsidy- and debt-driven economic model as an initial step towards raising US tariffs on Chinese EVs and clean energy goods to protect US
industry.
Yellen has shied away from raising any threats of new trade barriers, but said during her journey to Guangzhou she will not rule out more actions to protect a fledgling American supply chain for EVs, batteries, solar power and other goods from cut-price Chinese imports.
The Treasury is not expecting a major shift in Chinese policy as a result of Yellen’s visit, but US officials believe it was important to explain the risks that overinvestment in some sectors — and relatively weak consumer demand in China — present to both China’s economy and its trading partners.
Yellen said on Friday that part of her aim on the trip was to cement a US-China relationship that could  “withstand shocks and challenging circumstances.”  In addition to factory overcapacity, Yellen also said she would raise concerns about a deteriorating business climate in China for foreign companies, citing an AmCham survey that found one-third of American firms in China reported unfair treatment compared to local competitors.
These include  “imposing barriers to access for foreign firms and taking coercive action against American companies,” she said, adding that ending such practices would benefit China.
China state media pushes back
Chinese state media have pushed back against Yellen’s excess capacity message, saying it was an example of a double standard.
“While it is just basic economics that surplus products naturally seek out markets elsewhere once domestic demand is met, and Western nations have been doing that for centuries, when it comes to China, it becomes an ‘overcapacity problem’ threatening the world,” the China Daily said.
Yellen’s meetings, which continue in Beijing on Saturday through Monday, come just after US Comm­erce Department and Chinese Commerce Ministry officials met in Washington on Thursday.

2,PSX scales new peak in robust week,World Bank estimates country’s GDP growth target at 1.8pc for current fiscal year and below 3pc for  following two years.,"KARACHI: Amid ongoing economic optimism, the stock market maintained a robust outlook, extending a surprise record-breaking spree in the last days of Ram­azan by scaling a new peak in the outgoing short week.
Arif Habib Ltd (AHL) said the market continued its positive momentum throughout the four-day trading week, hitting an all-time high above the 68,000 level. The market sentiment was fuelled by a sharp deceleration in inflation and rising expectations of an interest rate reversal. 
Moreover, cut-off yields on treasury bills remained unchanged in the three- and 12-month tenors while increasing by 101 basis points in the six-month tenor. In addition, the petroleum sales witnessed a jump of 4pc year-on-year and 3pc month-on-month. 
The rupee remained stable at Rs277.93 against the dollar, adding just two paise week-on-week. 
As a result, the KSE 100-share index closed at a record 68,417 points after adding 1,412 points or 2.11pc week-on-week.
AKD Securities Ltd said the bullish momentum stemmed from easing inflation to 20.68pc in March, which turned the real interest rate positive for the first time in 38 months. Furthermore, foreign investors and institutions injected additional liquidity through buying, supporting the market’s bull run. 
Foreign buying continued during the outgoing week, clocking in at $3.9 million compared to a net buy of $3.6m last week. Major buying was witnessed in commercial banks ($2m) and fertiliser ($0.9m). On the local front, insurance companies reported selling ($5.6m), followed by broker proprietary ($1.7m).
However, the trade deficit widened by over 56pc to $2.17bn in March. With Eidul Fitr approaching, remittances are expected to increase, which will help control the current account balance. 
In addition, the Federal Board of Revenue missed its monthly tax collection target for the third consecutive month, although the 9MFY24 numbers were within the target. 
The World Bank estimated the country’s GDP growth target at 1.8pc for the current fiscal year and below 3pc for the following two years, resulting in an overall combined GDP growth for three years that remains lower than the population growth rate. 
Reports suggest that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is interested in purchasing shares of OGDC and PPL, in addition to an expected investment of $1bn in the Reko Diq project. 
The average trading volume eased 7pc to 307m shares and the average value traded settled at $42m week-on-week.
Meanwhile, other major news included sugar millers seeking permission to export ‘expensively produced’ sugar, cement despatches rising 3.85pc in March, and exports leapt 38.02pc. The Competition Commission of Pakistan issued notices to urea makers. 
AKD Securities Ltd said the market is expected to return its focus to negotiations with the IMF regarding the fresh Extended Fund Facility, the upcoming monetary policy committee meeting, and the corporate results season following the Eid holidays. 
Despite the market reaching its highest levels, the forward price-to-earnings ratio remains below 4x, instilling positivity regarding the market’s fundamentals.

3,CCP launches study  on digital economy,"Aims to understand the impact of digital markets and services on competition, economic growth, and employment opportunities.","ISLAMABAD: The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has launched a competition assessment of digital markets and services to make policy recommendations to help the government ensure global regulatory harmonisation.
The study aims to understand the impact of digital markets and services on competition, economic growth, and employment opportunities. 
At the end of this research study, the CCP aims to propose a draft bill on digital markets. Other countries such as Russia, the UK, the USA and India have already done so to regulate their markets.
Pakistan’s shift towards digital markets necessitates proactive policies to promote competition. This requires establishing and enforcing clear rules to prevent anti-competitive behaviour by major digital platforms and service providers.
Digitalisation has created new markets and transformed existing ones, changing the nature of competition. The study will analyse the opportunities and challenges presented by the digital economy for competition and suggest pro-competition policies that account for these markets’ unique dynamics.
The emergence of a few powerful platforms, the centrality of data (both personal and organisational), and the use of algorithms have given rise to significant competition concerns.

4,Short-term inflation edges up on petrol price hike,Real impact of petrol price rise on essential commodities will be visible in next week’s review.,"ISLAMABAD: Short-term inflation, measured by the Sensitive Price Index (SPI),  surged year-on-year by 29.45 per cent in the week ending April 4 primarily due to an increase in petrol prices, official data showed on Friday.
It witnessed a 0.96pc week-on-week increase.
The real impact of the petrol price rise on essential commodities will be visible in next week’s review. However, transportation costs caused a slight increase in the price of perishable products.
The SPI has remained above 30pc for the past 18 weeks.
In March, the decline in SPI came after a consistent 11-week period of inflation above 40pc, which surged from 29pc recorded on Nov 8, 2023. The weekly inflation hit a record 48.35pc year-on-year in early May 2023, but then decelerated as low as 24.4pc in late Aug 2023 before surging past 40pc during the week ending on Nov 16, 2023.
The items whose prices saw the increase week-on-week included ladies sandal (12.52pc), tomatoes (11.93pc), gents sandal (8.70pc), petrol (3.45pc), chicken (2.99pc), long cloth (2.23pc), onion (1.30pc), bread (1.03pc), beef (0.75pc), garlic (0.70pc), mutton (0.41pc) and rice basmati broken (0.14pc).
The items whose prices decreased the most over the previous week included bananas (3.57pc), wheat flour (2.68pc), eggs and LPG (1.89pc) each, diesel (1.18pc), gur (0.63pc), sugar (0.41pc), mustard oil (0.26pc), pulse masoor (0.25pc) and potatoes (0.23pc).

In contrast, the prices of bananas dropped 26.68pc followed by cooking oil 5-litre (20.53pc), vegetable ghee 1 Kg (17.61pc), vegetable ghee 2.5 Kg (17.28pc), mustard oil (14.22pc), wheat flour (5.86pc), diesel (3.61pc), and cigarettes (0.06pc).
The SPI stood at 326.29 compared to 323.20 in the preceding week and 252.06 a year ago.
The index, comprising 51 items collected from 50 markets in 17 cities, is computed weekly to assess the prices of essential commodities and services at shorter intervals. Data showed that the prices of 16 items increased, those of 13 items decreased and those of 22 items remained stable compared to the previous week.

5,Tesla scraps low-cost car plans amid fierce Chinese EV competition,The decision represents an abandonment of a longstanding goal that Tesla chief Elon Musk has often characterised as its primary mission: affordable electric cars for the masses.,"TEXAS: Tesla has cancelled the long-promised inexpensive car that investors have been counting on to drive its growth into a mass-market automaker, according to three sources familiar with the matter and company messages seen by Reuters.
The automaker will continue developing self-driving robotaxis on the same small-vehicle platform, the sources said. The decision represents an abandonment of a longstanding goal that Tesla chief Elon Musk has often characterised as its primary mission: affordable electric cars for the masses. His first master plan for the company in 2006 called for manufacturing luxury models first, then using the profits to finance a low-cost family car.
Tesla shares were down about three per cent in early afternoon trading after the Reuters report.
Musk has since repeatedly promised such a vehicle to investors and consumers. As recently as January, Musk told investors that Tesla planned to start production of the affordable model at its Texas factory in the second half of 2025, following an exclusive Reuters report detailing those plans.
Tesla’s cheapest current model, the Model 3 sedan, retails for about $39,000 in the United States. The now-defunct entry-level vehicle, sometimes described as the Model 2, was expected to start at about $25,000.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.
After the story was published, Musk posted on his social media site X that “Reuters is lying (again).” He did not identify any specific inaccuracies.
The stark reversal comes as Tesla faces fierce competition globally from Chinese electric-vehicle makers flooding the market with cars priced as low as $10,000. The plan for driverless robotaxis, which could take longer to deliver, presents a stiffer engineering challenge and more regulatory risk.
Two sources said they learned of Tesla’s decision to scrap the Model 2 in a meeting attended by scores of employees, with one of them saying the gathering happened in late February.
Elon’s directive is to go all in on robotaxi, that person said.
The third source confirmed the cancellation and said new plans call for robotaxis to be produced, but in much lower volumes than had been projected for the Model 2.
Several company messages reviewed by Reuters about the decision included one on March 1 from an unnamed programme manager for the affordable car discussing the projects demise with engineering staff and advising them to hold off on telling suppliers about programme cancellation.
A fourth person with knowledge of Tesla’s plans expressed optimism about the decision to pivot away from the cheap-car strategy in favour of robotaxis, a segment Musk has envisioned as the future of mobility. The source cautioned that Tesla’s product plans could change again based on economic conditions.
Squeezing profits from entry-level vehicles is a challenge for any automaker. But Tesla’s delay in pursuing the car Musk once called his dream made it much tougher because it now faces far more competition in that price range.
While Tesla spent years developing its highly experimental Cybertruck, a pricey electric pickup, Chinese automakers have raced ahead on affordable EVs, grabbing market share, gaining economies of scale and offering consumers bargain prices that Western automakers are struggling to match.
As Chinese EVs surged to challenge Tesla’s dominance, Musk was tending to his sprawling empire, which includes rocket-maker SpaceX, brain-chip developer Neuralink, and social media giant X, which Musk acquired in 2022. Formerly called Twitter, the platform has foundered under Musk’s volatile management, shedding most of its value as the company has lost revenue and advertisers.
