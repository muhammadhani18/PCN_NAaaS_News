0,Farmers threaten protests over wheat price stagnation,Say CM Maryam fails to deliver on the agriculture front.,"• Say CM Maryam fails to deliver on the agriculture front
• Demand support price of Rs5,000 per 40kg to sustain growers’ interest
LAHORE: Farmers across Punjab have voiced their disappointment following Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s decision to retain the previous year’s wheat support price and threatened legal action and protests if the government failed to address the issue.
The chief minister “has failed her first trial on the agriculture front in the province”, Kisan Board Pakistan President Sardar Zafar Hussain said at a press conference on Friday.
“She has decided to maintain the last year’s minimum support price of Rs3,900 per 40kg of wheat, while the Sindh province has enhanced it to Rs4,600 per 40kg.”
Flanked by Sardar Ashfaq Dogar, Akhtar Farooq Meo, and Rashid Minhala, Mr Hussain demanded that the government fix the minimum support price at Rs5,000 per 40kg to maintain farmers’ interest in the all-important crop.
He argued that considering the rise in the prices of fertilisers, pesticides, electricity, diesel and other inputs, the farmers deserved an increase of at least Rs1,100 per 40kg in the grain support price.
Otherwise, he warned, the farmers might shift towards alternative but more profitable crops, compelling the government to import wheat at much higher costs.
He regretted that the interests of the rural population were being sacrificed at the altar of “feared reaction” by the urbanites in case of an increase in the rates of wheat flour.
He said the alternative and better route for controlling flour prices is providing subsidies to the farmers on farm inputs.
He announced that if the government did not revise the wheat support price, the Kisan Board would not only approach a court of law against the injustice with the farming community but also come out on roads to force the rulers to accept their demand.
Responding to a query, he said the difference in the support prices between Sindh and Punjab would encourage grain smuggling from Punjab to other provinces, creating a crisis in the local markets.

1,Punjab govt to open transgender schools in each division: CM,"Eight of 11 divisions already have such schools, established by previous government.","LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has announced the establishment of a transgender school at division level and also directed the relevant authorities to provide educational facilities to special children in at least one government school in each district.
These decisions were ta­­ken at a meeting held to re­­­view proposed school education reforms in the province.
While chairing the revi­­ew meeting, CM Nawaz said: “Schools for trans­ge­nder [community] will be established at divisional level.”
Interestingly, nine of the 11 divisions in Punjab already had schools for the transgender community in the past. The initiative was taken by the previous PTI government under the supervision of the then Punjab Minister for School Education Murad Raas.

Eight of 11 divisions already have such schools, established by previous govt

When contacted, Trans Educational School Sys­t­­em, Multan, Principal Ali­sha Sherazi told Dawn that no one from the government had contacted them for the establishment of transgender schools, as such schools already exis­ted in D.G. Khan, Gujran­wala, Rawalpindi, Sargo­dha, Faisalabad, Gujrat, Multan and Bahawalpur. Only the one established in Lahore was later closed, she added.
Alisha Sherazi, a trans­gender and a former cons­u­ltant of UNDP who did her MPhil in Education, Planning and Manage­m­ent from Burhanuddin Za­­kariya University, expl­ai­ned that three of the scho­ols including D.G. Khan, Multan and Bahawalpur were giving vocational tr­­a­ining to members of the transgender community. Four labs for IT, stitching, cooking and make-up classes were established in those schools, while other schools were focusing on academics, according to the principal.
The government did not have the exact figures of transgender community’s population in the Punjab, Alisha added.
At the meeting, CM Maryam Nawaz directed relevant officials to implement a new comprehensive procedure, in line with the international best practices, for the selection of CEOs, DEOs, and DDEOs in each district.
She also took notice of delay in the delivery of textbooks to schools. How­ever, the officials present at the meeting assured the chief minister that textbooks would be provided to all schools by May. They said the supply of 41 per cent textbooks had alrea­­dy been completed. She was told that from next year, textbooks would be made available at schools by February.
They also presented the CM a new storybook on en­­vironmental pollution and climate change for schools.
Minister for School Education Rana Sikandar Hayat, senior minister Mar­riyum Aurangzeb, inf­ormation minister Azma Zahid Bukhari, Senator-elect Pervaiz Rashid, MPA Sania Ashiq, chief secretary and other relevant of­­ficers attended the meeting.

2,Facebook briefly deletes popular women-only group,Founder says group was deleted after Facebook warned her of an unspecified “intellectual property violation” linked to a post.,"LAHORE: Facebook briefly deleted a women-only group in Pakistan with more than 300,000 members who used it to freely discuss taboo topics, its founder Kanwal Ahmed told AFP on Friday.
Soul Sisters Pakistan, created in 2013, acts as a support group for women who share information about sex, divorce, and domestic violence — issues often deemed inappropriate to discuss publicly in Muslim-majority Pakistan.
Ms Ahmed said Face­book deleted the group late Wednesday after warning her of an unspecified “intellectual property violation” linked to a post.
“They didn’t even show which post it was,” said Ms Ahmed, who Facebook made a community leader in 2018 for her work on the group, adding that it is devoted to “personal stories and anonymous posts”. The group was reinstated late Friday, she said.
The group enables members to offer each other informal help, ranging from legal advice to emotional support, on topics that might otherwise draw abuse if posted about publicly. “The suspension of Soul Sisters Pakistan speaks to the arbitrary and non-transparent ways in which social media platforms operate and subtle ways in which community guidelines of these platforms can work against users in the Global South,” Shmyla Khan, a digital rights researcher, told AFP.
Soul Sisters Pakistan has previously come under fire from critics who accused it of promoting divorce and “wild” behaviour challenging tradition and patriarchal norms.
Digital activists have long complained of creeping censorship in Pakistan.
The Pakistan Telecomm­unications Auth­o­rity has taken down more than one million pages from TikTok, Instagram, Face­book and YouTube for obscene or indecent material.

3,MQM-P seeks compensation for families of mugging victims,"Resolution calls for swift action, tough measures on ineffective policing.","KARACHI: Expressing concern over the killing of people during street crimes in the city, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Friday submitted a resolution in the Sindh Assembly and demanded compensation for the victims.
The resolution, submitted by MQM-P lawmaker Taha Ahmed Khan, expressed concern over the rising incidents of street crimes in the city, stating that more than 50 people have lost their lives since the start of the year.
It said, “The house understands that most of those killed at the hands of street criminals were youth belonging to the underprivileged section of society, which is already under economic stress due to the financial situation of the country.”
The resolution acknowledged that most of those who lost their lives were the sole breadwinners of their families and proposed that compensation be given to the next of kiln of the victims.

Resolution calls for swift action, tough measures on ineffective policing

“Since the provincial government of Sindh has failed to protect the lives of its citizens, therefore the house hereby resolves and recommends a compensation of Rs5 million to the family of the deceased, a government job to one heir of the family as per their qualifications, and educational expenses for the children, if applicable,” the resolution said.
It further expressed concern that Karachi is deprived of a “safe city project”, noting that other major cities of the country have such a project in place to monitor the city through CCTV cameras.
“The house hereby recommends the immediate initiation of the ‘safe city project’ in the city, starting from districts of the city more vulnerable to street crimes, rather than the Red Zone of the city where the already protected VIPs reside,” said the resolution.
It suggested that strict action be taken against police officials, including SHOs, if they “fail to curb the crime rate in their relevant areas”.
The resolution also recommended strict actions against police officials, including the SHOs concerned, if they fail to curb the crime rate in their respective areas.

4,PTI demands thorough probe into threat letters to judges,Says party “stood firmly with the judiciary” and would not tolerate any attempt to attack the institution or pressurise the judges.,"ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Fri­day demanded a thorough investigation into threatening letters, laced with toxic chemicals, sent to apex courts judges and the identification of culprits behind this act.
In a statement, a PTI spokesperson said the party “stood firmly with the judiciary” and would not tolerate any attempt to attack the institution or pressurise the judges.
 






“Sending threatening letters to judges is part of the government’s plot to intimidate and scare them so they could not give decisions based on justice and law,” the spokesperson alleged.
He said that since the Supreme Court had initiated suo motu notice of the matter, an alarming upsurge had been witnessed in the number of threat letters received by the judges.
The PTI spokesperson added that the letters were laced with a chemical as part of a “well-thought-out plan” to create an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty in courts.
He asserted that after the judges raised their voices against the unconstitutional pressure and meddling in the affairs of the judiciary, it was inevitable for them to be pressurised by some quarters to make decisions of their choice.
The PTI spokesperson went on to add that the sole purpose of sending these letters to judges hearing cases related to the PTI was to influence the decisions. The threat letters to judges of the highest courts were “a very serious matter” and a direct attack on the judiciary, the PTI spokesperson said, and demanded special measures for the safety and security of all judges of the Supreme and high courts along with their families.
Meanwhile, PTI founder Imran Khan has formed a 14-member political committee, which “shall take all decisions and inform the core committee”, the party said in a statement on Friday.
The committee’s members include Omar Ayub Khan (chairman), Barris­ter Gohar Ali Khan, Sena­tor Shibli Faraz, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, Asad Qaiser, Shah Farman, former GB chief minister Khalid Khursheed, Senator Aon Abbas Buppi, Raoof Hasan, Hammad Azhar, Mian Aslam Iqbal, Atif Khan, Hafiz Farhat and Sher Afzal Marwat.

5,Fawad Chaudhry released from Adiala Jail,"Sources say more than 28 cases have been registered against the former IT minister in Lahore, Rawal­pindi, Multan, Attock, Faisalabad and Jhelum.","RAWALPINDI: Former information minister in the PTI government Fawad Chaudhry, who had been granted bail by the Islamabad High Court (IHC), was released from Adiala Jail on Friday.
On Monday, an IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri granted bail to Mr Chaudhry in a case related to alleged corruption in acquiring land for a dual carriageway project in Jhelum.
The National Accountability Bureau had accused him of receiving “illegal gratification” from a contractor in the Lilla-Pind Dadan Khan-Jhelum dual carriageway project.
The bureau also accused him of approving a petrol pump along the dual carriageway road project “for his personal interest” and misusing his authority and influence to help his relatives and others with the purchase of land along the dual carriageway.
Mr Chaudhry’s counsel argued that the case against his client was politically motivated and brought just for political victimisation and to stop the petitioner from contesting the general elections. The lawyer said nothing was recovered during his client’s physical remand.
Sources said more than 28 cases have been registered against Fawad Chaud­hry in Lahore, Rawal­pindi, Multan, Attock, Faisalabad and Jhelum.

7,Bilawal calls for dialogue on judicial reforms to overcome challenges,"Urges opposition to respect mandate, not disrupt parliament.","LARKANA: PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Friday called for a National Charter of Reconciliation and judicial reforms to find solutions to economic and security problems.
While addressing a gathering at the president’s camp office at Naudero House, the PPP leader emphasised the need for political parties to sit together and play their role in finding solutions to the issues faced by the country.
He added that out of respect for the people’s mandate, his party decided to support the incumbent government.
“People, through their vote, gave a message to work together and make Pakistan a modern country.”
According to Mr Bhutto-Zardari, opposition members should also realise that people have voted for them, and they should play their role in overcoming the challenges instead of disrupting the parliament.

Urges opposition to respect mandate, not disrupt parliament

“I observe whenever I go to the parliament that politicians talk of their egos,” lamented the PPP leader, who is also a member of the National Assembly.
“With political reconciliation — where all institutions remain within their realm of responsibilities — we could do much more to effectively address the economic issues.”
“We must jointly work to pull people out of poverty,” the PPP leader said and vowed that the PPP would play its role in solving economic problems and other issues.
He also thanked people for their “unflinching support and struggle,” which allowed his father, Asif Ali Zardari, to become president for the second time.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari also talked about the reference filed by his father — during his first term as the president — in the Supreme Court regarding the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto case.
The Supreme Court has issued a short order — declaring the former prime minister’s trial unfair — but “we are waiting for the detailed order,” said the PPP chairman.
He said the PPP would hold a historic congregation in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh on April 14 to mark the death anniversary of the former prime minister and pay homage to his “dynamic leadership”.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said people from all over the country would participate in the event, which has been moved from April 4 — the death anniversary of the ex-PM — due to Ramazan.
He also urged the voters to set priorities and work with consensus for the development of his constituency NA-194 in  Larkana and PS-11, where his political secretary, Jamil Soomro, won the election with a thumping majority.
The PPP chairman also urged his party’s MNAs and MPAs to serve their constituents.
PPP Sindh President Nisar Khu­hro, PPP Women Wing Chairperson Faryal Talpur, Aijaz Jakhrani, local PPP leaders and workers also attended the Iftar party.
