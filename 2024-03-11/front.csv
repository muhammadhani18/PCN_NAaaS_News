1,Shehbaz’s ‘lean cabinet’ to be unveiled today,New federal govt aims to commence work on tasks outlined in first 100-day agenda,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has finalized a ""lean cabinet,"" which will be sworn in on Monday (today) to commence work on the tasks outlined in the first 100-day agenda.
Two key PML-N leaders confirmed to The Express Tribune that the prime minister has finalized his team. They disclosed that the names of these ministers, along with their portfolios, will be unveiled on Monday. ""The names will be announced tomorrow [March 11]; just a few more hours to go,"" one of them stated.
They elaborated that the prime minister has opted for a compact federal cabinet this time, believing that portfolios should be entrusted to individuals capable of diligent work, delivery, and steering the country out of multifaceted crises.
During his 16-month tenure as the PM between April 2022 and August 2023, Shehbaz had an excessively large federal cabinet, drawing widespread criticism with some describing it as a financial burden on taxpayers amidst economic challenges.
PML-N sources disclosed that in the initial phase, PM Shehbaz intends to appoint only a select few ""competent individuals"" as ministers to oversee key ministries.
They indicated that more inductions might follow later, with members from the MQM-P, the PMLQ, and the IPP eyeing cabinet berths.
The PPP has already declared its abstention from joining the forthcoming federal cabinet.
Nevertheless, PM Shehbaz extended another invitation to the party leadership to join the cabinet. ""The PPP politely declined the offer but will continue to provide input on policy formulation,"" one of the sources revealed.
Certain PML-N leaders, potentially cabinet members, emphasized the party's focus on achieving the tasks outlined for the first 100 days.
Their objective is to address economic challenges, attract investment, curb inflation, and ensure optimal utilization of time. ""Governance, economic revitalization, national security, agriculture, and climate change remain paramount,"" one source affirmed.
""In addition, commitments related to education, healthcare, employment, and the party manifesto will be fulfilled,"" the source added. The PML-N manifesto also pledges to abolish the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and restore Article 62 & 63 to their original form.
In the backdrop discussions, some PML-N leaders hinted at the privatization of underperforming entities, emphasizing the urgency of the matter.
They also underscored the need to renegotiate a fresh deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to address ongoing economic challenges.
The sources indicated that the initial cabinet is expected to comprise just over a dozen ministers. In the first phase, portfolios such as finance, foreign affairs, energy, planning, interior, information, and privatization will be assigned.
Moreover, federal ministers may be assigned additional portfolios to maintain a lean cabinet size. Expected inclusions in the federal cabinet include Ishaq Dar, Khawaja Asif, Ahsan Iqbal, Attaullah Tarar, and banker Muhammad Aurangzeb.
The newly formed federal cabinet will be administered the oath by newly-elected President Asif Ali Zardari, who himself was sworn in on Sunday.
The duo of PM Shehbaz and President Zardari, returning to their previous roles, represents the new face of the coalition government, seemingly poised for stability.
Previously, PM Shehbaz led a coalition government following the ouster of the PTI-led federal government, while Zardari completed his first five-year term as President of Pakistan in 2013.

2,PTI calls for scrutiny of police officials' accounts,"Amid ongoing crackdown, Omar Ayub demands immediate unblocking of social media platforms","Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan on Monday cautioned against the crackdown on Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) workers, stating that parliamentary committees will scrutinise the accounts of several officers, including IGs of Punjab and Islamabad.
Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad amid the alleged crackdown on PTI leaders and workers, Omar said, ""We are striving against electoral rigging. At present, there is a surge in human rights violations in Pakistan. PTI workers are being subjected to human rights abuses. We appeal to the Supreme Court to take notice of this.""
He condemned the crackdown against PTI’s peaceful protests across the country, adding that over 100 party workers were arrested and terrorism cases were lodged against them.

""We strongly condemn this. The IG, on Maryam Nawaz's orders, is facilitating this. The IG has now become a domestic servant of the PML-N,"" he added.
Omar Ayub mentioned that cases were filed against Sher Afzal Marwat, Shoaib Shaheen, Amir Mughal and other party leaders in Pakistan. ""The faces of Islamabad's IG, SSP, DC, and others should be exposed. The police's only mission was to crush PTI,"" he said.
The opposition leader vowed to scrutinise the accounts of officials through the National and Provincial Assemblies' Public Accounts Committees.""We will summon all these officers to any committee and question them.
All of them will be held accountable. We will also audit the caretaker government. We will check the accounts of every government department to see where the expenses are being made,"" he stated.

Omar Ayub expressed concern over the continued blocking of various social media platforms. ""All this is being done so that Pakistan's youth do not receive timely information. We demand that these websites be unblocked,"" he urged.
Ayub said that in the modern era, Pakistan cannot advance without the use of social media and demanded the immediate restoration of these sites without any hindrance or blockade.
Regarding the detention of Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, and other PTI workers, he said efforts would be made for their release. ""Bushra Bibi is not being provided sufficient facilities. She should not be considered as Imran Khan's weakness,"" he added.
He further commented on President Asif Zardari's health, stating, ""His health does not permit him to be the head of the state. He is unwell and not fit to become the supreme commander. I advise him to focus on his treatment rather than reconciliation,” he concluded.

3,SC castigates FIA for harassing journalists,Notes that neither any judge nor court registrar moved any complaint against any social media campaign,"The Supreme Court has castigated the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for harassing media personnel, while noting that authorities issued notices to journalists under the guise of investigating an online campaign against the superior judiciary—an investigation that the SC never ordered.
A three-member bench led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa on Monday took up a joint petition filed by the Press Association of the Supreme Court and the Islamabad High Court Journalists Association on February 29.
In their petition, the journalist organizations had requested the apex court to strike down a notification issued by the last interim government on January 16 to constitute a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to identify people behind a “malicious campaign” against SC judges.
They had contended that the FIA has no jurisdiction to inquire into or investigate the so-called “explicit and malicious campaign against judges of the SC” or “derogatory remarks against the superior judiciary of Pakistan”.
During the hearing, when the court asked officials if the FIA filed the First Information Report (FIR) against the alleged campaign on the basis of a complaint moved by any SC judge or the court’s registrar, the FIA replied in the negative.
“The inquiry notice [sent to various journalists] states that a campaign was launched against the judiciary, while there is no mention of a campaign against the judiciary in the FIR. In this case, the judiciary has been used as a pretext,” Justice Isa noted.

The CJ said neither did any Supreme Court judge file a complaint with the FIA, nor did the registrar register a complaint.
He said the Supreme Court's name was used to create an impression as if the action was taken upon the judiciary's directive, damaging the image of the judiciary in the eyes of the public.
“Why not take action against the FIA for defaming the judiciary? The relevant officers of the FIA themselves are becoming the cause of defamation of the judiciary,” he added.
In their petition, the journalistic organization had also requested the SC to declare Rule 17 of the PECA Investigation Rules 2018 and Section 30 of PECA 2016 ultra vires, and strike it down, “insofar as it allows the inclusion of intelligence and other government or public sector organisations/ agencies in a JIT”.
The CJ also noted as to how officials of intelligence agencies could be included in the JIT. “Intelligence agencies are not an enforcing agency; they do not have the authority to enforce the law. The enforcement of the law is not within their purview,"" he said.
The petitioner’s lawyer Barrister Salahuddin stated that the FIA initiated 115 inquiries and issued 65 notices. He said laws against contempt and disrespecting the judiciary are already in place. If the judiciary delegates its authority to the FIA, it would be misused.
The Supreme Court later rejected the reports compiled by the FIA and the police. The court ordered detailed reports from both as it adjourned till March 25.

4,New-look cabinet with old faces,PM Shehbaz sets the tone for the 'perform or perish' approach,"In a blend of fresh faces and seasoned members, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif introduced his 19-member federal cabinet, before conveying to them to either 'perform or perish' as the nation faced pressing issues requiring a 'surgical operation' instead of experimenting with 'antibiotics' once again.
Shortly after the oath administered by the newly-elected President Asif Ali Zardari, the prime minister not only explained the roadmap but also outlined the challenges ahead, emphasising economic revival and tackling inflation as the government's ""biggest challenge and test.""
The inaugural cabinet meeting took place at the Prime Minister House, where the ministers formally began addressing the tasks outlined in the first 100-day agenda.
The members of the cabinet include Ishaq Dar, Azam Nazir Tarar, Attaullah Tarar, Khawaja Asif, Ahsan Iqbal, Ameer Mukam, Owais Leghari, Jam Kamal, Salik Hussain, Riyaz Pirzada, Rana Tanveer, Mohsin Naqvi, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Shaza Fatima, Qaiser Sheikh, Ahad Cheema, Musadiq Malik, and Muhammad Aurangzeb.

Ministerial portfolios were assigned as follows: Asif – defence, defence production, and aviation; Dar – foreign affairs; Ahsan Iqbal – planning; Tanveer – industries and production; Azam Nazeer Tarar – law & justice and human rights; Salik – overseas Pakistanis & HR development; Aleem Khan – privatization & Board of Investment; Jam Kamal – commerce; Leghari – Railways; Ata Tarar – information & broadcasting; Siddiqui – science & technology, education & professional training; Qaiser Sheikh – maritime affairs; Pirzada – housing & works; Musadik – petroleum & power; Aurangzeb – finance & revenue; Cheema – economic affairs & establishment; and Naqvi – interior & narcotics control.

Apart from inflation, the prime minister said that electricity theft, elite subsidy, full recovery of taxes without imposing any additional taxes, privatisation, curbing Rs5,000 billion circular debt of electricity and gas sectors and addressing the climate change issues were key tasks for the government.
“What is the fault of a poor man that he has to bear the brunt of Rs400 billion electricity theft annually,” PM Shehbaz regretted.
In his inaugural speech to the cabinet members, PM Shehbaz conveyed that the path ahead is marked by blood, sweat, and sacrifice. Now, he emphasised, it was the opportune moment to join forces and combat the common adversaries of poverty, corruption, and inflation, steering clear of internal discord.


In his call to action, PM Shehbaz stressed the importance of recovering already imposed taxes to bid farewell to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. He underscored the need to eliminate leakages, citing a figure where only a fraction of collected funds reached the national treasury.
At present, he provided a rough explanation of leakages, suggesting that if Rs1,000 billion were being collected, Rs3,000 were not contributing to the national treasury—hinting that it was finding its way into certain individuals' pockets. Emphasizing the government's duty to recover the entire sum, he called for unwavering commitment from the cabinet members.
Commenting on the SIFC, PM Shehbaz said that it was an effective forum and mechanism that will continue to be supported as it helps create an investment climate, cut delays and red tapism.
Giving a recipe for getting rid of seeking monetary support from different countries, the PM said that he would only talk about investment in his meetings with his counterparts and envoys.
Despite eying big targets, PM Shehbaz revealed that he had to extend the time for the bidding process of outsourcing airports, which had started in his previous stint, till May as otherwise everything was needed to start from scratch.
He said getting rid of the Rs840 billion annual losses of PIA alone could pave the way for several hospitals, universities and other development projects.
Among the key decisions taken during the maiden meeting, the Prime Minister directed that a committee should immediately be established to control the prices of food and other daily items in the country.
The PM said that the committee will closely monitor the prices of food and other daily commodities in collaboration with the provincial governments.
Meanwhile, the federal cabinet approved the ban on the export of bananas and onions till April 15, 2024, on the recommendation of the ministry of commerce. The ban has been imposed to ensure the abundant availability of bananas and onions in the market during the month of Ramadan.
On the recommendation of the Ministry of Interior, the federal cabinet approved the application of a Dutch citizen, Muhammad Aurangzeb – the one sitting in the federal cabinet, to regain citizenship of Pakistan.
Moreover, the federal cabinet approved the appointment of Major General Abdul Moeed as the Director General of the Anti-Narcotics Force on the recommendation of the Ministry of Narcotics Control.

5,Aseefa's nomination as first lady sparks debate,Legal experts believe president has power to appoint any female member of his family as the first lady,"President Asif Ali Zardari has decided to confer the title of the first lady upon his daughter, Aseefa Bhutto. Traditionally, the role of the first lady has been reserved for the wives of presidents or prime ministers, prompting questions about the legitimacy of appointing a daughter to the position.
Some legal experts, when contacted, confirmed that the president holds the authority to confer the title upon any female member of his family. They said there are no legal barriers preventing such an appointment.
The president's entitlements and privileges mentioned in the act of 1975 do not include any mention of the first lady. On the other hand, the Warrant of Precedence issued by the Ministry of Interior does not mention the first lady or first husband.

The Warrant of Precedence is a formal document or list that outlines the order of precedence or ranking of individuals in a particular context, such as official ceremonies, diplomatic events, or state functions. It establishes the protocol for seating arrangements, introductions, and other formalities based on the relative importance or status of individuals or their positions.
Under constitutional provisions and existing laws, all privileges and benefits enjoyed by the president extend to his immediate family members, including children, spouses, and other relatives.
