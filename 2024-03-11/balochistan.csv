0,Curtain falls on women’s film and art fest,WIFF’s largest edition closes at event celebrating women creators’ impact,"The Women’s International Film & Arts Festival (WIFF) came to a close in a ceremony hosted by the Embassy of Spain in Islamabad on March 8 – aptly coinciding with International Women’s Day.
The film festival, in its 8th year running, featured various cultural expositions through women-directed films sourced from around the world. With a line-up of 31 short films from 19 different countries including Pakistan, Iran, Russia, Turkey, Spain, Japan and others, this was Women Through Film’s (WOTF) most elaborate and expansive edition of WIFF to date.
Following a two-day public screening of the films at the Pakistan National Council of Arts (PNCA), screening sessions at different institutions, a workshop hosted by renowned Spanish filmmaker Elena Molina and other events centred on the role of women creators, the festival wrapped up at the residence of the Spanish ambassador.
The closing ceremony started with screenings of two short films followed by a reception hosted by the Ambassador of Spain. The first film that was showcased was Pakistani directors Esha Shakil and Haris Ahmed Khan’s ‘Explicit’, a story highlighting the struggle of a girl trying to adhere to society's oppressive standards for women. The second film was Spanish director Elisa Puerto Aubel’s ‘The Barn’, which was a critical commentary on the environmental crisis and politicians’ failure to act accountably.
This year, the Embassy of Spain in Islamabad joined the Embassies of Germany and France, the British Council, the Foreign Ministry of Ukraine and others in supporting the film festival to enable cultural exchange alongside women empowerment.
In his closing remarks at the ceremony, the H.E. Ambassador of Spain to Pakistan, Jose Antonio de Ory, emphasised Spain’s stance on the importance of supporting women by stating that, “For us, feminism, protection, empowering women is a nexus of our foreign policy in Spain. For the Foreign Minister and all of us, what we call the feminist foreign policy is a tenet for our ministry of foreign affairs.”
The ambassador went on to congratulate the founder of WOTF and curator of WIFF, Madeeha Raza for her efforts towards providing women a platform to amplify their voices. Madeeha, while speaking to The Express Tribune, recounted her journey when, 8 years ago she had started on her own by bootstrapping the initiative and then encountering people such as the EU ambassador who saw the significance of her work and pledged their support.

1,Shoppers throw traffic out of gear,"Commuters suffer owing to power outages, dysfunctional traffic signals","The people of Rawalpindi city and outskirts spent the last two days in traffic gridlocks as a good number of motorists have thronged commercial hubs for Ramazanul Mubarak shopping.
The traffic flow was severely interrupted from 10am to 10pm on all city roadways because of pre-Ramazan wholesale and retail shopping. Traffic halted for hours on all roads and at intersections. The downtown areas including Raja Bazaar, Nirankari Bazar, Kashmiri Bazar, Ganj Mandi, Iqbal Road Bazar Talwaran, Bohar Bazar, Mochi Bazar, Dingi Khoi, Jamia Masjid Road, Bani Chowk, Kalan Bazar, Vegetable Fruit Market, City Sadar Road Sadiqabad witnessed worst traffic jams.
The traffic wardens were seen as helpless in regulating the traffic flow as school pick and drop vans and ambulances were also stuck for hours. The announcement by the City Traffic Police (CTP) to improve the traffic system before the start of the holy month failed to materialise. In addition to locals, several families from the surrounding areas of Rawalpindi travelled to the city for wholesale pulses, grocery and spice markets including the dates market.
The massive presence of shoppers in city shops and wholesale markets aggravated the traffic problem. Motorcyclists also continued to violate one-way traffic because of less presence of wardens at intersections.
The dysfunctional traffic lights and power outage from 9am to 3pm further added fuel to the fire as motorists were seen taking advantage of manual traffic handling by wardens.
Traffic remained fully blocked on Murree Road from Committee Chowk and Liaquat Bagh to Chandni Chowk. The flow of traffic on Rawal Road was also halted.
According to a city traffic police officer, some roads will be converted into one-way with the help of barriers for smooth traffic flow during Ramazan. He said that a restriction is being imposed on pushcarts for standing together in one place in the inner city, adding parking won’t be allowed at commercial centres situated in the inner city.

2,Cheap Ramazan bazaars project shelved,Pindi embraces unbridled food inflation before the holy month,"While the prices of essential commodities and grocery items have reached a historic level and shattered the purchasing power of consumers, the Rawalpindi district administration has abandoned the successful execution of subsidised rates and cheap Ramazan bazaars during the holy month.
The District Market Committee has refused to set up cheap Ramazan bazaars after the provincial government avoided providing subsidies for vegetables, fruits, chicken, meat and iftaar items. At least 16 cheap Ramazan bazaars and 27 cheap vendor bazaars have been abolished.
The Punjab Livestock Department’s announcement of giving beef and mutton at discounted rates has also turned out to be a drama.
Even cheap chicken stalls could not be set up so far in the city markets. Around 100 price control magistrates of the district are still present in their offices and have yet to check and control rising prices.
The prices of all iftar items have also been increased by 50 to 60%. In the open market, potatoes are being sold at Rs90 per kg, onions Rs400 per kg, garlic Rs750 per kg, ginger is Rs900 per kg, chicken meat at Rs450 per kg, beef Rs1,200 per kg, mutton meat Rs2,200 per kg, and dates Rs750 to Rs850 per kg.
The livestock department officials claim that the department is unable to sell subsidised beef because of no funds and the absence of cattle at its disposal.
Due to the devastating inflation, citizens who buy five kilos of iftar items every Ramazan have to buy one kilo and those who buy one kilo of items now buy a quarter of every item.
All vegetables and fruits have become almost out of reach of the consumers. In open wholesale and retail markets and Sunday bazaars, live chicken is being sold at Rs510 per kg, red beans Rs510 per kg, lentil gram Rs300 per kg, high-quality rice Rs450 per kg, ghee Rs480 per kg, oil Rs490 per kg, sugar Rs160 per kg, besan Rs320 per kg, bitter gourd Rs350, green coriander Rs80 per kg, tomatoes Rs200 per kg, Lemon China Rs200 per kg, green chilli Rs300 per kg, cabbage Rs100 per kg, peas Rs200 per kg, and eggplant Rs130 per kg.

3,Beggars flood Rawalpindi markets,"Citizens have expressed their dismay, highlighting that the rampant beggary tarnishes the image of a society","Professional beggars have rushed into markets of the garrison city ahead of the holy month of Ramazan. The issue has notably intensified this season.
Among the beggars, eunuchs have become a common sight, seeking alms across various parts of the city, while the local authorities appear to remain passive observers amidst this growing concern.
The streets and busy roadways of Rawalpindi are now scenes of persistent begging, with a notable presence of children, women and the elderly employing various tactics to draw sympathy and donations from the public.
These individuals often engage in activities such as offering to clean vehicle windows at traffic stops, actions that suggest coordination with the so-called ‘beggar mafia’.
Citizens have expressed their dismay, highlighting that the rampant beggary tarnishes the image of a society that prides itself on civility and order.
Criticism has been particularly directed towards the Child Protection Bureau, an entity that, despite its mandate to safeguard children’s rights, seems to turn a blind eye to the exploitation of young beggars.
