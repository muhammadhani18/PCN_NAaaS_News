0,Tax troubles of salaried class,"In upcoming budget, this class should be relieved of paying high taxes","“In this world, nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes,” a famous quote by Benjamin Franklin. This quote squarely applies to the registered taxpayers of Pakistan, particularly the salaried class.
If you are in the tax net and pay your taxes on time, then your life will remain miserable not only due to harassment during enforcement but also due to the levying of further taxes to meet revenue targets.
Meanwhile, those who are out of the tax net will continue to live as they please. The exorbitant cost of commodities, high inflation, reduced purchasing power, and the imposition of huge taxes will not only impact the lives of citizens but also force professionals to seek jobs outside Pakistan, resulting in a brain drain that has been observed for quite some time.
Those who are unable to find opportunities elsewhere and cannot make ends meet may engage in activities that could lead to a law and order situation in the country.
Tax is usually defined as a sum of money demanded by a government for its support or specific facilities or services, levied upon incomes, property, sales, etc. In general, it is the right of every law-abiding citizen and taxpayer to know what kind of facilities they are receiving because of this mandatory contribution.
The broken roads, constant power breakdowns, gas load sheds, poor infrastructure, law and order situation, lack of availability of resources, substandard education system, unemployment, and what not – all these issues will lead one to question: why should these people be registered under the tax net and pay the government the due share of taxes?
Although this doesn’t justify their contention, the situation worsens when the government lacks willingness to tax those who contribute more towards GDP, either not taxing them at all or taxing them at very low rates. On the other hand, those who are paying their taxes on a timely basis are penalised for those who aren’t.
The perfect example for this case is the salaried class of our country, which gets targeted whenever there is a tax revenue shortfall. However, the time has come when this class should be relieved from taxes in the upcoming budget.
Legislators of Pakistan should not only focus on short-term policies but also consider the long-term outcomes of their measures. Each year, we witness the salaried class being further burdened by increased taxes or the withdrawal of tax benefits.
It was just last year when the government significantly raised salary tax rates, citing pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to meet revenue targets for the ongoing fiscal year.
Among various options, the salaried class became an easy target, as most of their taxes are collected at source by their employers under Section 149 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.
Read: Govt mulls help to expand tax base
Previously, the government had revoked certain tax credits and deductible allowances, resulting in the same net position of paying higher taxes. These included deductible allowances for profits on debt financing for the construction or acquisition of a new house, tax credits for investments in shares and Sukuks, and life and health insurance.
While this impacted individuals beyond the salaried class, salaried individuals were the most affected. Legislators must consider that if the government cannot provide essential facilities to its citizens, then at least these modest tax benefits in the form of rates, credits, deductible allowances, etc should not be withdrawn.
It’s essential to consider that sectors contributing more to the GDP, such as agriculture, retail, construction, and development, are also taxed based on their contribution. Failure to do so could lead to resentment among taxpayers.
The upcoming government, while presenting the budget for 2024, should consider measures to provide relief to the salaried class. This could include waiving taxes for senior citizens and disabled persons, as there used to be a reduction in tax liability available for them.
Moreover, senior citizens and disabled persons should be exempt from taxes, at least to the extent of their salary income. Additionally, the tax on salary income should be exempt if it’s equal to or below Rs1,200,000 per annum, currently set at Rs600,000 per annum.
Considering that interest-free loans by employers do not generate salary income for employees, taxes on such notional incomes should be removed. Furthermore, the salaried class should receive tax refunds automatically within 120 days of filing a return if applicable.
The government could also introduce additional benefits, such as tax credits for employers who provide provident fund benefits to their employees, thereby supporting the salaried class during challenging times.
Another important amendment to propose is that withholding tax rates should be lower than the rates of recipients, ie, salaried individuals, which they use to calculate their liability at the time of filing their return.
This practice is not new; it’s already implemented in many cases where the tax rates of the withholding tax agent are lower than the rates at which the recipient would pay taxes when filing the return.
This adjustment would assist the salaried class in avoiding the accumulation of refunds, especially in cases where employers may not facilitate claiming advance taxes or tax credits.
Additionally, there’s a pressing need to compare tax rates with those prevailing in other countries in the region and worldwide, considering factors such as tax deductions and rebates they allow.
It’s often said that where there’s a will, there’s a way. The time has come for the upcoming elected government to consider the principles of levying taxes and the objectives to be achieved through taxation, especially for the salaried class of our country.
Many times, tax benefits are omitted from the law due to inadequate enforcement by officers, highlighting the need to strengthen our tax machinery for enforcement rather than depriving taxpayers of benefits. Moreover, there’s a necessity to broaden the tax base and bring more people into the tax net using available data, which would also help achieve short-term revenue targets.

1,Economic growth is like magic potion,"Pakistan needs pro-growth policies such as tax cuts, freer trade, minimal regulations","The gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Pakistan has consistently underperformed growth in the region as well as in the rest of the world.
The magnitude of the discrepancy (ie, the difference between real GDP per capita elsewhere and in Pakistan) has not only been increasing but is also extraordinarily consequential when combined with the explosive population growth.
Pakistan’s standard of living is on the wane. Putting population and US dollar GDP together as of 2019, Pakistan ranked 183rd in prosperity (standard of living) out of 215 countries in the world.
GDP growth has been shown to be very powerful in improving lives of all classes of citizens. Pakistan needs to grow at a sustainable rate of 7-9% per annum over the next decade in order to get out of its current morass.
The answer to Pakistan’s underperformance is a simple, straightforward set of supply-side economic policies. Pakistan needs to adopt pro-growth policies such as tax cuts, sound money, freer trade, spending restraint, minimal regulations and privatisation.
A total rationalisation of the tax system should be prioritised above all six pillars of supply-side economic policies. There should be fewer taxes, where those taxes that are chosen to remain have low rates on broad tax bases. Exemptions, deductions, exclusions, credits and write-offs should be kept to a bare minimum. Low tax rates provide the least incentive for people and business to evade, avoid or otherwise not report taxable income.
People earn income after tax to save and consume. The lower the tax rate, the more willing the people are to work. After-tax income is the return on labour for the rich and poor alike.
Evidence shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid. High rates inevitably put pressure on the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest in other non-productive assets (ie, property, etc).
The more taxes increase, the more they undermine the market economy. Every specific tax as well as a nation’s whole tax system becomes self-defeating above a certain height of rates.
Countries where supply-side economics were practiced, real GDP growth has shown to be high and during anti-growth policies, real GDP growth has shown to be low.
Unfortunately, Pakistan being subjugated by the umpteenth anti-growth IMF programmes centered on raising taxes, devaluations and balancing the budget at all costs to “stabilise” the economy, has never seen the way forward. No serious economist would consider these measures to attain rapid GDP growth.
Economics is all about incentives and taxes have consequences. The history of income tax has lessons. High tax rates can bring the economy to heels, while low or reduced tax rates can yield phenomenal bursts of economic productivity and prosperity – these findings comport with common sense.
There is no economic theory, be it classical, neoclassical, Keynesian, supply-side or Marxist, that promotes higher taxes as a stimulus to economic activity. Thus, under a tax increase, the numerator, revenues, will rise less than forecast, and GDP, the denominator, will also advance less than forecast – but quotient, the percentage collected, will be the same.
Pakistan is a perfect example of this paradox. Its tax-to-GDP has remained constant at around 9% per annum with a GDP growth rate of less than 5% per annum over the last two decades.
To make matters worse, federal expenditures, dangerously, keep on increasing year-on-year. Currently, they stand at a shocking 22% of GDP.
Persistent higher deficits, excessive borrowing and overstretched debt service payments have led to higher and higher tax burden on citizens. No nation on earth has taxed itself to prosperity and Pakistan is no exception.
Pakistan is suffocating. The World Bank recently warned in its Global Economic Prospects report, published in January, that high borrowing costs have “changed dramatically” the need for developing nations to boost sluggish economic growth aimed at speeding up the process of getting overstretched debt-distressed countries back on their feet.
If Pakistan’s growth remains weak and financing conditions worsen, it will not see an easy path out of this problem.
Pakistan will continue to sink deeper, heading towards an inevitable “disorderly” default and a full-blown economic meltdown.
Economic growth is like a magic potion – a cure for many illnesses and good for our homeland’s wellness.

2,Gaining economic independence,"From steel sector setbacks to educational neglect, country needs swift action","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been making headlines recently due to a political party’s request for its intervention in conducting a third-party audit of February 8 elections.
This move is being criticised by their opponents as against the national interest. Interestingly, it brings to mind an independent audit I’m also advocating for regarding a national project, but that’s a discussion for another day.
With debts now reaching approximately 91% of gross domestic product (GDP), the recent letter highlights the stark reality of power dynamics, revealing who truly holds sway despite the rhetoric we often hear from our leaders. Over the past six years, despite various parties taking the helm, the economy continues to decline rapidly, with little tangible progress made towards achieving economic independence beyond mere slogans.
In many other nations, the public would have already formed their own political party and ousted the incompetent rulers. However, our citizens have lost faith in their own ability to effect change, repeatedly voting the same leaders into power. This is unsurprising in a country where spending on education has consistently remained below 2% of GDP over the past six years, compared to a global average above 4% and over 5.5% in first-world countries.
No wonder, we lack rational discourse with many clinging to hollow romanticism, steeped in feudal rhetoric, as they place their hopes on self-proclaimed saviours.
Regarding the incompetence of our leaders, consider the steel industry as a prime example. It took us 38 years to establish our first large-scale steel mill, which operated for a mere 30 years before heavy debts forced its shutdown in 2015. Despite promises from the new government since August 2018 to recommission it, there has been no progress to date.
Eliminating our dependence on debt demands significant effort, planning and implementation, requiring the professionalisation of relevant sectors and challenging entrenched vested interests.
However, authorities show great reluctance to take even the smallest steps that might disrupt the existing status quo. For instance, our annual public procurement volume averages around $70 billion, with the potential for annual savings of $4-5 billion. Yet, despite data science driving modern economies, it seems from the PPRA website that they ceased compiling annual progress reports a decade ago.
Similarly, professionalising the economy is crucial for its advancement. However, out of a board of 10 members, seven positions are occupied by bureaucrats, while the remaining slots, allocated for private members, remain vacant indefinitely. Why are we not appointing professionals to manage institutions that require expertise in tendering, contracting, negotiations, logistics, and experience in leading large supply chains?
Amidst the election fervour, a significant event in December 2023 went unnoticed – Tuwairqi Steel lost its arbitration case in The Hague. Behind this seemingly ordinary news lies a profound tragedy.
Read: Shehbaz promises economic revamp
Tuwairqi Steel, a foreign investor, poured $340 million into establishing a steel mill in Pakistan during a time when the country was plagued by terrorism and suicide bombings. After operating for a few months in 2013, they were forced to shut down due to the government reneging on its promise to provide natural gas at the agreed-upon price.
This steel mill had the capacity to produce over 1.1 million tonnes of high-quality steel, leading to import substitution and utilising substantial volumes of local iron ore.
Had a more prudent approach been taken regarding the gas price, the first phase of the project would have been completed years ago, paving the way for reaping the rewards of the second phase – an additional investment of approximately $900 million.
It’s ironic that despite possessing over 1.5 billion tonnes of iron ore reserves, the steel industry relies primarily on scrap. Accounting for roughly 50% of steel needs, it generates a mere annual revenue of around $0.6 billion, a stark contrast to India’s $128 billion and South Korea’s $96 billion.
Even our current demand of approximately 14 million tonnes per year likely represents a suppressed figure. An indirect indicator of unmet demand is our annual import expenditure, totalling around $10 billion for iron, steel, machinery, and related equipment.
The industry faces numerous challenges, including high power costs and gas shortages, severely constraining both its technical capabilities and fiscal capacity.
The only solution to the steel industry’s challenges lies in maximising the use of existing resources, including Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM), Tuwairqi Steel (now National Steel), and the scrap-based rerolling sector. Here are some suggestions:
1. Integrate Tuwairqi Steel into the provisions of the recently introduced Foreign Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act, 2022, granting it similar waivers given to associated investors for expedited commissioning.
2. Revitalise PSM with a professional board and explore potential synergies with Tuwairqi.
3. Establish a dedicated steel ministry managed by professionals, along with a comprehensive steel policy and regulatory framework akin to the petroleum industry.
4. Facilitate the sustainable supply of indigenous iron ore to Tuwairqi and establish steel banks to finance the modernisation and capacity enhancement of private sector rerolling mills. Additionally, establish pig iron industries to substitute scrap imports with local iron ore, potentially saving around $2 billion annually.
Implementing these steps is crucial for achieving true economic independence and reducing reliance on the IMF. Until then, taking offence to any call for its intervention is meaningless. However, further delays in implementing these steps may leave us with no room for error.

3,Cheaper Chinese EVs dominate world markets,"Environmental fears, tech advancements drive shift towards sustainable transportation","Chinese electric vehicles (EV) are gaining immense popularity throughout the world because of their cheaper rates and amusing features, flooding and astonishing the US and European markets despite tough competition with local industries in the West.
China has knuckled down to do far more work on research and development with a view to having a full command over technologies, manufacturing new products, revamping cutting-edge technologies and providing the world with cheap and attractive goods.
EVs are getting cheaper and abundant and as people are eager to meet global climate goals, climate-friendly technologies such as EVs are becoming the future of global industry. A deluge of cheap Chinese EVs might dent sales of US auto giants including Ford and General Motors to a great extent.
US President Joe Biden has swung into action and issued directives to the US Department of Commerce to investigate potential national security risks from imported Chinese vehicles and address concerns about dependence on foreign supply chains, particularly in critical industries like automotive manufacturing.
This investigation aims to assess any risks posed by Chinese vehicles, including potential threats related to technology, cybersecurity and intellectual property infringement.
US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said rising sales of Chinese EVs in the West were a national security risk for the US and the European Union.
“A sophisticated EV, and then an autonomous vehicle, is filled with thousands of semiconductors and sensors. It collects a huge amount of information about the driver, the location of the vehicle and surroundings of the vehicle,” Raimondo said at an event hosted by US think tank Atlantic Council, according to a report.
Earlier, she noted how Beijing had banned the passage of vehicles made by US EV giant Tesla in certain parts of the country, citing national security concerns.
About 70% EV cars and over 95% EV motorbikes of China are dominating the international market, while the US, Europe, Canada, Japan and other countries have lagged behind in cheaper technology.
Although the US and Europe bristle with far better and costly technologies, yet China’s sales volumes are so high that the West cannot compete on prices.
China is fully capable of covering production costs due to high volumes, but the US and European car volumes are decreasing quickly and their industries could face the spectre of closure.
A decade ago, China was notorious for producing the replica of everything, but this is for the first time that it is manufacturing good-quality, cheaper products in competition with market leaders including the US, Germany, South Korea and others. “That is why, the West is coerced to take some initiatives, while impeding progress of China’s growing economy,” said auto sector analyst Muhammad Sabir Sheikh.
According to media reports, BYD sold 3 million electrified vehicles in a year, more than any other company, and it now has production capacity to manufacture 4 million cars. China’s state-owned shipping giant Cosco [China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company] has ordered 24 large vehicle carriers.
“I think we should not look at the perspective of the US being narrow-minded towards other countries but look at the cost of such policies to its own consumers. The average price of EV in the US has increased significantly in recent years, making it out of the reach for many. Political representatives are more likely to introduce policies that benefit their own constituents and lobby groups rather than foreign producers and consumers,” he said.
Chinese automakers, especially BYD, are now the largest producers of EVs in the world. Although their access to the US market is limited, they may route their production through other countries such as Mexico.
One benefit of globalisation is that it provides innovative companies with different avenues to access their target markets and grow. “We see a potential increase in foreign direct investment in third markets with better linkages with the US,” said Sheikh.
“One key factor in EV growth is the evolution of battery technology. Also, we are seeing that cars are becoming more autonomous over time. With net zero emission targets, investment in EV is likely to grow,” said auto maven and IBA Assistant Professor Aadil Nakhoda.
Furthermore, “as technology for EV improves, it is likely that consumers will become more attracted towards this as an alternative, even in the developing world. The idea is to make it more accessible and cheaper.”
Concerns over economic competition, national security and regulatory disparities contribute to the perception that the US and Europe resist the progress of China in the EV industry. Protective measures, trade tensions and intellectual property issues may reflect a desire to safeguard domestic interests.
Critics argue that such policies hinder global collaboration and the potential consumer benefits from cheaper and quality EVs. However, perspectives can vary widely and decisions are often influenced by complex geopolitical and economic considerations.
If the US actively hinders Chinese companies due to perceived competition, China may face challenges in expanding its global market share.
“Determining the superiority of EV technology between China and the US/Europe is nuanced. China has rapidly advanced in EV production and battery technology, while the US and Europe have made substantial contributions to innovation,” said EV expert and Mehran University of Engineering and Technology Professor Dr Qasim Arain.
“Each region has unique strengths, with China excelling in production scale and affordability, and the US/Europe focusing on high performance and cutting-edge technology. Comparisons should consider factors like battery efficiency, charging infrastructure and regulatory environments. In essence, the question doesn’t have a definitive answer, as both regions contribute valuable elements to the evolving landscape of EV technology.”
The future of EVs appears promising globally. Increasing environmental concerns and advancements in technology are driving a shift towards sustainable transportation.
Governments worldwide are promoting EV adoption through incentives and infrastructure development ass battery technology improves, offering longer ranges and faster charging.
The automotive industry is investing heavily in EV development, indicating a long-term commitment to this transformative shift. EVs are likely to play a significant role in the future of global transportation.

4,Reforms in Planning Commission-II,"Semi-reform, evolutionary process of PC may be uphill task, but it must be pursued","If there is a desire to commence the initial reform process and rid the Planning Commission (PC) of myriad anomalies, a number of key changes and interventions will need to be pursued with reform-oriented and impartial mindset.
First four key points have already been discussed in the first part of the article published on February 26, 2024. Further steps include:
Fifth, reform of the ecosystem: It ought to be fully appreciated that at least a semi-reform of the PC may be needed today as the commission did not evolve with changing economic realities. While the PC is relaunched in the existing ecosystem, it should be understood that it still has to interact with the existing system to deliver, which may not change quickly in tandem.
As such while there may be a spectrum of changes which can be introduced at the new entity, they may not work effectively unless the existing system, which interacts with the existing PC, also begins to reorient slowly with the new entity.
As such creating a new entity will do little good unless key ministries, departments, and provinces are nudged to align with the updated and upgraded mandate of the new entity.
This appears a demanding task but remains achievable if small nudges to the overall ecosystem are made with the clear vision to have an entity which is empowered to not only produce quality documents and intellectual ideas but also to have the force of law to execute, implement and ensure economic and financial resources are in hand to deliver policies in play.
Fiscal discipline, revenue generation and expenditure, national debt, commerce and trade are some of the important areas which require re-orientation in the medium to long run evolution to make the new PC a truly effective entity.
Sixth, data access and driven: The new entity must be facilitated by full automation and digital platforms making it efficient, transparent and data-driven for improved decision-making.
While the above is needed to help it operate as a world-class planning entity, limited planning can be done if the new entity does not have access to valuable economic, commercial, energy and other deposits of databases across federal and provincial ministries and departments.
For example, presently the PC has to reach out to ministries for any data relating to energy, mining, trade or companies amongst others in order to carry out detailed and in-depth analysis to offer informed advice. Most of the time this inhibits the PC to offer any meaningful and independent advice to the government as it continues to rely on draft summaries generated by relevant ministries for views and feedback.
This is a major challenge to support data-driven research and advice for informed decisions as databases are hoarded within various ministries and departments. The enactment of the new entity must ensure this aspect is addressed.
Read: Integrated planning to help resolve energy crisis
Seventh, organisational structure: The organisational structure of the new entity needs to be reimagined in order to work well with the prevalent ecosystem and private sector.
The organisational structure has to be such that it ought to build-in better representation and coordination with provincial representatives. At the moment, policies and provincial Annual Development Plans (ADPs) are seldom discussed in detail, which leads to lack of coordination, activity duplication, and waste of resources.
Apart from strong HR and administration departments, the new entity must have a strong research and policy department, which should house some of the best-in-class researches and professionals.
The new entity must have on-ground representation in the provincial P&D departments in order to better coordinate planning activities at the federal level. There ought to be a few high-powered working party forums where all federal and provincial policies need to be discussed and debated.
The role of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) should be housed within the new entity so all economic and financial matters are better aligned with existing policies.
Further, all provinces should present their ADPs for in-depth debate and discussion to the relevant working party so there is a clear understanding and alignment of federal and provincial objectives, resource allocation and policy harmonisation.
Working parties may decide to raise any matter to National Economic Council (NEC), as appropriate.
Eighth, human resource: Presently, the Planning Commission has 14 members including the PC deputy chairman and the prime minister. Officers within each technical section are regular government employees of MoPD&SI.
These officers are seconded to the PC by MoPD&SI and attached with each member of the PC according to their sector expertise. This mode of human resource deployment must end.
The new entity must be able to recruit its own staff, independent of MoPD&SI. This would mean having a strong human resource department, which is empowered to recruit the most appropriate human resource from the market at market-based packages.
Senior officers of the new commission must be fully responsible and accountable for their teams and must have a meaningful say in human resource development, retention, compensation and career progression.
In the existing PC, while Annual Confidential Report (ACR) is signed by relevant members, real authority remains enshrined in the office of the Principal Accounting Officer.
Given the commission’s nature of work and one of its roles as an apex think tank, it must be able to attract the best-in-class human resource and retain it, both locally and internationally. This will require a commission, which works nimbly and operates similar to a private sector organisation given it has to attract people from the private sector.
The new entity should be headed by a professional; it must never be open to political leaders, present or past, and should have the force of the law to protect it from political appointees.
Ninth, reporting: The new commission should report to the prime minister and the NEC and should be positioned as not only a planning body but also a premier think tank to the NEC and the PM.
In summation, it must be understood that semi-reform and subsequent evolutionary process of the PC may be an uphill task, however, it is an undertaking which must be pursued. It should also be appreciated that the PC has a vast overarching mandate with interactions with myriad government ministries and departments; it holds a centre stage.
As such, changes to the PC will inadvertently require adjustments in the workings of key ministries that work closely with the PC or areas where the mandate of the PC has sway. Those ministries will also need to adjust, which can be done in phases.
Semi-reform and evolution of the PC is not of the PC only, but if the journey is commenced with intent, it may well be the nucleus which ushers in ecosystem’s reform and evolution, which has been sought for some time now.
