Upon receiving information, PMSS Rehmat was able to achieve major breakthrough in the search operation today, reports the press release of Directorate General PR of Naval Headquarters.
The recovered bodies were handed over to the concerned authorities. The four bodies that were recovered earlier were laid to rest today.
""The ongoing search and rescue operation by PN and PMSA is a clear demonstration of PN's commitment to providing assistance during any unfortunate incidents at sea""
Initially, fellow fishermen attempted to rescue those in distress, followed by coordinated efforts from the Maritime Security Agency, Pakistan Navy, and Fishermen's Cooperative Society. These efforts led to the successful rescue of 43 fishermen, while two remained missing, prompting continued search operations. They were fished out by another launch and dropped at jetty on Thatta coast.

1,Women lawyers move SHC against Aurat March,"High court issues notices to provincial government, PEMRA, others; seeks response by March 19","The Sindh High Court (SHC) issued notices on Monday to the provincial government and other concerned parties in response to a petition against the annual Aurat March held last week. 
The petition was filed by a group of women lawyers who claim that movements detrimental to society and Islamic Shariah were being promoted in the Aurat March. They alleged that ""dance and nudity were being promoted in the name of women's freedom, and organisations such as the Arts Council were allowing it to happen"".
A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice SHC Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi heard the case. The bench observed that the plea was filed prior to March 8. 
The counsel for the petitioners argued that they had sought an early hearing of the petition, but their request was not heard. 
The court, while maintaining that women have complete freedom according to Islamic law, observed that certain negative acts have a negative impact on society.

The petitioners argued that cultural centres and parks are being used for the Aurat March and similar events and prayed that the practice should be stopped.
Following the arguments, the SHC issued notices to the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA), the federal and provincial governments, the Arts Council and other organisations linked to Aurat March. It instructed the concerned parties to submit their response by March 19. 
The march has been a topic of controversy in Pakistan in recent years. The organizers have been accused of promoting vulgarity and obscenity, while supporters argue that it is a peaceful way to raise awareness about women's rights and equality.
The issue has sparked a debate on the freedom of expression, women's rights, and the use of public spaces for events.
The Aurat March was held for the first time in Karachi, Hyderabad, Islamabad, Peshawar, Quetta, and Lahore in 2018 to mark International Women’s Day, a universally celebrated day to raise awareness about women’s rights.
The event gradually evolved into a social movement with women and transgender people from all spheres of life joining hands to work for women and trans rights. Lawyers, doctors, artists, engineers, homemakers, trade union activists and students have all joined the annual event.

2,Justice Munib Akhtar joins key three-judge panel,Jurist's inclusion in committee important as PTI plans to approach SC for relief in poll case,"In a development following the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, Justice Munib Akhtar has been appointed as a member of the three-judge committee under Section 2 of the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act 202.
Legal experts view this as a positive step, as the committee plays a crucial role in forming benches and handling cases filed under Article 184 (3) of the Constitution.
Justice Munib Akhtar's inclusion in the committee gains significance amid Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) plans to approach the apex court, seeking relief regarding alleged electoral rigging.
The committee will also be responsible for forming a new, larger bench to hear the government's intra-court appeals against the judgment declaring trials of civilians in military courts as unconstitutional. The composition of the bench is crucial in handling politically sensitive cases.
Yasser Kureshi, a lecturer in South Asian Studies at Oxford University, said that the presence of Justice Munib on the committee will be a positive development.
The reason the committee was originally formed was to limit the CJ’s discretion in bench formation, and the presence of a strong dissenting voice like Justice Akhtar will help realise the committee’s purpose to constrain the CJ’s discretion and produce fewer partial benches, and hopefully more larger benches for important cases""
Kureshi also hoped that upcoming important election-related cases would not only heard by the same three-member bench that has been hearing them so far; and that the committee is consulted for the formation of benches for these important cases.
Advocate Abdul Moiz Jaferii said that the “one-way traffic” that has been ongoing since Justice Ijazul Ahsan resigned will come to an abrupt halt.
""I think even when Ijazul Ahsan was around, his opposition to matters he considered wrongly handled was tepid and weak. I feel that Justice Munib will be a fundamentally different proposition,"" he reckoned.
It is pertinent to note that Justice Munib Akhtar – known for using the term 'master of roster' for the CJP to form benches in his judicial opinions – was part of several special/larger benches during the tenure of ex-CJP Umar Ata Bandial.
He was one of the minority judges who withheld approval for the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act 2023.
Despite strong opposition from powerful circles, Justice Munib Akhtar stood firm on his stance to conduct elections for the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Assemblies within 90 days. He was also a member of the larger bench that declared trials of civilians in military courts unconstitutional and has faced criticism for his ruling on the interpretation of Article 63 A of the Constitution.
However, a section of lawyers is drawing parallels between this decision and a recent judgment. In that judgment, it was affirmed that the SJC could continue proceedings against any judge even after their resignation or retirement.
Read: Ex-SC judge found guilty of misconduct
During the tenure of ex-CJP Bandial, there were visible divisions among judges, which were reduced after the resignations of Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Sayyad Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, both belonging to the same camp.
Now, Justice Munib Akhtar's inclusion in the committee adds an interesting dynamic. Justice Ijazul Ahsan, who also ruled against the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act 2023, fulfilled his responsibilities as a member of the three-judge committee until his retirement.
Even during his tenure on the committee, Justice Ahsan raised objections to the composition of the larger bench in the military courts case and the special bench assigned to hear Judge Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi's petition.
Following his sudden retirement in January, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah took over as a member of the committee. Senior lawyers believe that with the inclusion of Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Shah's opinion will be crucial in the committee led by CJP Isa.
According to the law, decisions in the committee are made by a majority. Similarly, Justice Munib Akhtar has also become a member of the Supreme Judicial Council, a constitutional body responsible for addressing complaints of misconduct against superior court judges. During the tenure of the incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan, Isa, the influence of judicial politics cannot be disregarded.
Both Ijazul Ahsan and Munib Akhtar expressed dissent regarding the establishment of a subcommittee tasked with proposing amendments to the rules of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), a constitutional body responsible for considering the appointment of judges to superior courts.
It has been observed that Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Ayesha Malik, and Justice Shahid Waheed did not participate in larger benches following their decision declaring trials of civilians in military courts as unconstitutional.
Nevertheless, several important election cases were presented before the bench presided over by Justice Munib Akhtar before the elections.
Meanwhile, the swearing-in ceremony for Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan as a Supreme Court judge is scheduled for Monday (today). His appointment is expected to enhance the position of CJP Isa, who currently faces two vacant seats in the Supreme Court.
Moreover, legal bodies continue to advocate for amendments to the JCP rules, expressing concern over the delay in convening a commission meeting to discuss amendments to the JCP Rules of 2010.

4,SCBA condemns arrests of PTI lawyers,Apex body of lawyers decides to convene an emergency meeting,"The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has vehemently condemned the arrests of prominent lawyers including Latif Khosa, Salman Akram Raja, Mumtaz Mustafa, and others, demanding their immediate release.
In response to the arrests, the apex body of the lawyers also announced plans to convene an emergency meeting of its executive body to decide the next course of action in this critical situation.
The decision came amid the backdrop of countrywide protests staged by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) against alleged rigging in the February 8 general elections.
Supporters and activists took to the streets in Rawalpindi, while protests erupted in Karachi, Kandhkot, Tank, and other cities in response to the PTI's allegations of election result manipulation.
SCBA President Shahzad Shaukat and Secretary Syed Ali Imran, along with the 26th executive committee, issued a strong condemnation of the arrests, expressing dismay over reports of several other lawyers being detained while peacefully protesting against alleged electoral malpractices.
“Similar reports of several other lawyers being taken in custody while peacefully protesting against the alleged electoral malpractices in the recent general elections have also received from every nook and corner of the country,” a statement read.While demanding the immediate release of all arrested lawyers, the president and the secretary said that as senior advocates of the Supreme Court and life members of the association. It viewed the arrests with grave concern. “All of them have always represented the highest standards in the legal profession,” they commended.

He further lambasted that despite this association, on numerous occasions, having called upon the authorities to respect the legal and democratic rights of citizens, including lawyers, the recent trend of targeting and arresting members of the legal fraternity is alarming.
“It reflects a blatant disregard for constitutional rights, rampant lawlessness, and an abuse of power.”
Furthermore, to address the escalating aggression against the legal community, the SCBAP has decided to summon an emergency meeting of its executive committee to chart out a course of action.
“Let no one be mistaken, SCBAP reiterates its commitment to defending the rights of lawyers and upholding the fundamental rights, democratic principles, protection of human rights and rule of law,” it asserted.
Meanwhile, the HRCP also condemned the ongoing high-handedness of the state in suppressing PTI protestors and detaining several key party figures in Lahore during a protest against alleged electoral malpractice.It stated that all citizens, irrespective of their political affiliation, possess a constitutionally protected right to assemble freely and peacefully.

5,Vawda predicts more arrests for PTI leaders,Former PTI leader says party digging itself into a hole from which 'even a crane could not rescue it'," 
Former senator Faisal Vawda on Sunday predicted that all named accused individuals, including Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ali Amin Gandapur, would face arrest in the May 9 case.
Speaking on a private news channel, Vawda insisted that the state, akin to a mother, must protect itself from harm. ""All of them have to be tried by army courts. The state is a mother; it is not injured like this,"" he asserted.
Asserting that those involved in the May 9 riots should not be allowed to escape arrest, he said that their legal proceedings should take place in military tribunals. He stressed that no one should be permitted to evade the law.
Vawda also expressed concern about the potential fragmentation of the country if the state's authority was questioned.
Concerning the political landscape, when asked about the political future of the Pakistan Tehreek-Insaf (PTI), the former PTI leader doubted the party’s ability to return to power.
“The party can form a government on the moon, but they cannot form it in Pakistan,"" he quipped and anticipated further legal challenges for the party.Vawda predicted a troubled legal path for the PTI and criticised its past political strategies, suggesting that it was digging itself into a hole from which even a crane could not rescue it.
He urged PTI to reconsider its actions, adding that the party inflicted harm on both democracy and Pakistan.
Reflecting on PTI's recent engagement with JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Vawda advised a broader approach to dialogue.
He urged the party to engage with various political figures, stressing the need to move for the greater good of the country.
“If you can go to Maulana, then you will have to talk to all and move forward for the country,"" he added.

6,PML-N bags 9 more NA reserved women seats,Slots from Punjab allotted to party after ECP denied them to SIC-PTI,"An additional list of nine women belonging to the PML-N has been released for the reserved seats in the National Assembly from Punjab.
The party women to which these seats have been allotted include Saira Tarar, Bushra Anjum Butt, Shamalia Rana, Maryam Ikaram and Syeda Amnah Batool from Lahore; Huma Akhtar Chughtai from Rawalpindi; Mahjabeen Abbasi from Bahawalpur; Gulnaz Shahzadi from Sialkot; and Shazia Farid from Gujranwala.
As the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), a small party in which the PTI independent lawmakers found refuge was denied these seats, they were allocated to the PML-N.
Recently, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), in a 4-1 majority verdict, dashed the SIC's hopes for a quota of reserved seats, citing ""non-curable legal defects"" and a violation of mandatory provisions in submitting party lists for them.
The SIC moved the Peshawar High Court, which on March 6 stayed the ECP notification.
The party also moved the Lahore High Court against the order but on Friday it failed to convene the court to stop the ruling parties’ candidates for the reserved seats from being sworn in.
The LHC rather deferred the matter till March 13 while issuing notices to respondents.
These oath-taking ceremonies were marred by loud protests by the SIC lawmakers, who described the move as illegal and a contempt of court.
PTI-SIC leader Omar Ayub said: “We condemn those who are forced upon us through Form-47 elections and will continue to do so until our full 180 members arrive at the assembly.”
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan seconded Ayub and argued that his party’s members in the NA and provincial assemblies joined the SIC, expecting that the reserved seats based on their quota would be given to them. However, he regretted that it did not happen.
The NA speaker, while clarifying that the PHC order had not reached his office yet, asked the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman to explain the matter further.
The AGP while speaking on the floor of the House said the PHC order was limited to the extent of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa lawmakers’ oath and it could not be applied to other provinces, especially when similar matters were pending before the courts there.
Admitting that it would have been a contempt of court had the speaker administered oath to the lawmakers elected on reserved seats from K-P, the AGP said no violation was committed by swearing in the lawmakers belonging to other areas.
In the Punjab Assembly, the provincial legislature’s speaker also administered oath to 24 new reserved seats lawmakers by virtue of the ECP’s March 4 order amid protests by the SIC members.
The MPAs who took oath on women’s seat were Sadia Muzaffar, Fiza Maimoona, Abida Bashir, Maqsoodan Bibi, Amira Khan, Somia Atta, Rahat Afza, Rukhsana Shafiq, Tahseen Fawad, Farzana Abbas, Shagufta Faisal, Uzma Butt, Maria Talal, Sajda Naveed, Nasreen Riaz, Afsheen Hasan, Amna Parveen, Shahr Bano, Zeba Ghafoor, Rubina Nazir, and Syeda Sameera.

7,"PML-N, PPP both deny Naqvi is ‘their man’",New federal cabinet members expected to be sworn in today,"Former caretaker Punjab chief minister Mohsin Naqvi will be sworn in as the interior minister on Monday (today) when the new federal cabinet members will be administered their oath of office, a source within the PPP confirmed.
A senior PML-N leader, who is en route to becoming a federal minister, also indicated that the oath-taking ceremony was expected on Monday.
A close aide of Naqvi also corroborated that the oath-taking ceremony was being held on Monday at around 3pm when the ex-interim CM would be sworn in as the interior minister.
A PPP leader said Naqvi was being sworn in as the interior minister but this did not mean that his party was effectively becoming part of the cabinet.
He continued that the PPP’s position was very clear about joining the cabinet.
The PPP leader maintained that Naqvi was “Rawalpindi’s man”, who would become the interior minister with PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s blessings.
Naqvi extended all kinds of favours to the PML-N but not to the PPP’s provincial chapter – so much so that it had complained to the party leadership of ex-interim CM’s “discriminatory” attitude towards them.
The PPP leader claimed that according to his information, Naqvi was not being appointed as a special assistant or adviser to the PM.
He continued that the ex-interim Punjab CM would take up his assignment under Section 91(9) of the Constitution that permitted a minister to function without being a member of parliament.
He claimed that the PPP, whose co-chairperson was elected as the president of the country just a day earlier, did not even have the numbers to make a senator on its own.
He said the PML-N would support Naqvi during the Senate elections as without its backing, the former Punjab caretaker minister could not become a senator..
A senior PML-N leader, who had on Saturday termed Naqvi’s accession to the interior ministry an unfortunate development, said the ex-interim Punjab CM was not his party’s man.
He said his party would welcome a PPP leader in the cabinet. He continued that with Naqvi, the PPP was formally becoming a part of the cabinet.
When asked about his views that he had expressed a day earlier, the PML-N leader said indeed it would be unfortunate for this government to have Naqvi as the interior minister. However, he continued but more importantly, it was for Naqvi to think that with him becoming the interior minister, how much credibility would left of the election process that he oversaw as a caretaker CM.
When asked why the PML-N was making Naqvi the interior minister if it believed it was not in the interest of democracy, he replied that this was a coalition government and his party had to honour its coalition partners’ choice. He claimed that Naqvi was the PPP’s choice.
To the query about Naqvi being the pick of the ‘powerful circles’ for this slot, he laughed and said he would stick to him being the PPP’s choice.
To the question if the PPP lacked the numbers to have Naqvi elected as a senator, the PML-N leader said they were in a coalition arrangement.
“If the PPP asks us for support to make him [Naqvi] a senator, we [PML-N] will have to consider it.”
To another query, the PML-N leader said Ishaq Dar was happy with being the foreign minister as far as his knowledge was concerned.
He refuted the rumours of Dar being made the deputy premier.
He continued that total size of the cabinet would be limited to 18 members.
Naqvi’s close aide denied that the former caretaker CM was seeking anyone’s support for the Senate elections. He claimed that Naqvi would become a senator with the support of independent lawmakers. When reminded that these lawmakers were no longer independent after the general elections, he replied that all the details could not be shared at this stage.
When PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira was told that a PML-N leader had claimed that Naqvi was his party’s man in cabinet, he said the PPP had categorically decided not to become a part of this cabinet.

8,CPNE condemns curbs on press freedom,Urges newly elected govts to resolve issues confronting print media,"The Council for Pakistan Newspaper Editors (CPNE) has expressed concern about the state of media freedom and the challenges confronting the print media in the country.
It has noted that announced and unannounced restrictions on the freedom of press and expression are against the Constitutions which bestows upon the citizens the basic right to know the truth.
The CPNE stated this in a long press release issued after a meeting of its standing committee on Sunday in Karachi.  CPNE President Irshad Ahmed Arif chaired the meeting attended by the council’s office-bearers from all over the country.
 It said freedom of expression is every citizen’s right under Article 19 of the Constitution.
“Registration of FIRs against journalists for performing their professional duties, the arrest of Imran Riaz Khan and Asad Toor under the black law of PECA [Prevention of Electronic Crime Act, 2016] and suspension of internet and X are condemnable of the [outgoing] caretaker government,” it said.
During the meeting, the standing committee members also passed a resolution urging the newly elected government to review the restrictions imposed on the freedom of press and expression and immediately take corrective measures.
“The media is the fourth and most important pillar of the state. It should not be undermined. Ill treatment meted out to the media must stop.
“The media is playing an important role in strengthening democracy. It is playing its role despite all restrictions. The new government must ensure press freedom,” it said.
During the meeting, the members also lamented that the caretaker governments both in the centre as well as in provinces did not pay much attention to payment of dues to newspapers.
CPNE Secretary General Ejazul Haq noted that during the rule of interim governments, the matters related to payment, quantum of advertisements and issuance of government advertisements to regional newspapers were put on the backburner.
“The interim government cancelled ads a number of times after issuing them,” he added. The standing committee asked the newly elected government to resolve the issues faced by print media.

9,Gandapur urges judicial probe into cypher,Calls upon CJP to form judicial commission for cypher case investigation,"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has called upon Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa to form a judicial commission to investigate the cypher issue.
Expressing concern over a perceived conspiracy against PTI’s government in 2022, Gandapur asserted, ""One day, all conspirators will be exposed”.
Citing discrepancies in Form-45s, the chief minister claimed that, according to the official documents, the PTI had emerged victorious in the general elections.
To address concerns of result tampering, Gandapur demanded the formation of a judicial commission to thoroughly investigate the electoral process.
He also criticised the distribution of reserved seats, designated for the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), among various political parties, deeming it unconstitutional.
