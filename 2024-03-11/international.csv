The marchers demanded the Muslim rulers for military, political and financial assistance to Palestinians. The protestors, carrying placards and banners, chanted slogans against the Zionist regime of Israel and it’s supporters, including the rulers of the Muslim World. JI Karachi Ameer Engr Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said Israel was defeated by Hamas several months ago, it was only the United States and unfortunately leaders of the Muslim World that have been enabling the Zionist regime to continue the massacre. He urged the civil and military leaderships to play their due role as Pakistan did in the past against Israel.
On the occasion, he said that Ramzan is the month of struggle and the JI will increase the pressure on the government to play it’s due role in the days to come. JI leader Dr Osama Razai, MPA Farooq Farhan, Al-Qudas Foundation President Sabir Abu Maryum, labor leader Khalid Khan and others also addressed the march. Rally in Hyderabad Jamaat Islami Hyderabad staged a protest rally in front of the Hyderabad Press Club to express solidarity with Palestinian Muslims and protest against Israeli atrocities. JI District Ameer Aqeel Ahmed Khan led the rally in which a large number of JI activists participated.
Leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, Dr Mustansar Billahand Faisal Mughal Advocate, also participated, and apart from addressing the protesters, District General Secretary of Jamaat-e-Islami Adnan Danish and President of JI Youth, Irfan Qaimkhani, also addressed the crowd. On this occasion, the participants expressed emotional solidarity with their Palestinian brothers and raised slogans against Israel in a fervent manner.
Addressing the participants, District Amir Aqeel Ahmed Khan expressed sorrow over the insensitivity of the Muslim Ummah and said that Israel is bombing residential areas of Gaza, targeting children and women, yet international organizations remain silent spectators.
We strongly condemn all forms of aggression against Gaza in the strongest terms and demand from the international community to take decisive action against Israel for its crimes against humanity. Meanwhile, in Tando Adam, JI activists came out to show unity and express solidarity with oppressed Palestinian Muslims and the people of Gaza against the atrocities of the Israeli army.

1,Women of substance tell stories of perseverance,Demand reserved seats for women in assemblies be increased from 16% to 23%,"The reserved seats for women in the federal and provincial legislatures should be increased from 16% to 23%. Moreover, 5% to 20% of general seats should be allocated specifically to women. It is crucial for political parties to ensure the representation/women in decision-making bodies.
These demands were made during the inaugural Sindhi Women’s Day ceremony in Karachi on Sunday.  Attendees at the event included prominent women from various fields, including sports, law, journalism, and other walks of life, who shared their remarkable achievements.
Mahreen Baloch, a gold medalist in boxing who had represented Pakistan in combat sports at Commonwealth Games, said that even men feel intimidated when women enter the boxing arena. Hailing from Lyari, where men are renowned in boxing, Baloch has played a pivotal role in ensuring women’s inclusion in the sport.  Verun Pirzado, a sports teacher, expressed her aspirations to elevate football as the first female referee in football. She stressed the need to empower women not only in academia but also in sports.
Fahmeeda Riaz Shewani, a member of the organizing committee for Sindhi Women’s Day, pointed out that in recent elections, women were mostly confined to reserved seats, despite some contesting on general seats like Maryam Nawaz and Shazia Marri.
However, the 5% condition set by the Election Commission of Pakistan for women candidates on general seats is deemed insufficient.  Given that women are 50% of the population, their representation should also be equitable across all seats in assemblies, the Senate, judiciary, and police.
The underrepresentation of women in various fields stems from both administrative policies and the fear and apprehension associated with pursuing employment beyond sunset. The state needs to address these issues to facilitate women’s meaningful contributions to the country. Outdated tribal norms and customs act as barriers, and efforts are required to overcome them.
Despite the challenges, women in Sindh continue to break barriers, from Karachi to  Karunjhar  and Kashmore. Rabiya Ejaz Sheikh, a designer on YouTube from Khairpur, learned her craft from YouTube, built her channel, and earned enough to construct her own house. She encourages young girls to enter their preferred fields and take advantage of the current era, allowing them to earn from home.
Activist Najma Maheshwari shared her story of defying societal norms. Despite facing criticism when she entered politics, she was eventually supported by her husband, a political activist himself. She works against forced conversions, emphasizing the need to protect young girls from being taken away forcibly and subjected to a life of suffering.
Marvi Kalhoro, a young lawyer, highlighted her journey as the first educated girl in her family. Despite the absence of political awareness in her parents, they supported her education. Today, the literacy rate of girls in her family remains zero.  Choosing law as her profession, Kalhoro feels a deep sense of purpose in helping women.
Laila Nasir, a host on a Sindhi channel, discussed the baseless notions that discourage girls from joining the media.  She emphasized that with self-confidence and a commitment to one’s rights, there is no danger. Parents should trust their daughters and encourage them to pursue their passions.
Parh Ijaz, who runs her own website, initially wrote columns before shifting her focus to training and guiding women for participation in the media field. Prof Shahnila Zardari said that women should be given safe environment in the universities. All women have the right to get education without fear of any intimidation.
Lok singer Nahid  Mallani  and Alghoza Nawaz Arbab Khoso performed at the event, which also featured speeches from Wahida Mahesar, Shazia Nazamani, Rubina Chandio, and others.
They all advocated for the enforcement of laws against violence towards women, ensuring the implementation of maternity leave laws in the private sector during pregnancy, and translating education slogans into actionable measures to increase the literacy rate among girls.

2,Bodies of four fishermen found,Their families stage protest at jetty over delay in search operation,"The families of the missing fishermen aboard the launch Al Asad Ali, missing in the sea near Hijamaru Creek staged a protest. The families of fishermen missing in the sea for six days staged a protest.
According to Spokesman Coastal Media Centre Ibrahim Hydari Kamal Shah, the fishermen families protested in Ibrahim Hydari due to delay in the search of their loved ones and lack of information. He said that each day the families of the missing fishermen wait at the jetty with the hope of that they would come back.
According to Kamal Shah, fishermen families are complaining that more than a dozen fishermen are still missing, but proper measures are not being taken at the government level to search for them.
Fishermen’s children, wives and other relatives participated in large numbers in the protest. It should be noted that the dead bodies of three fishermen were claimed to be found yesterday, but surprisingly, these dead bodies could not be transferred to Keti Bandar port in Thatta till now.

3,"Baba, Bhit locals engulfed in misery","Gas, water, and health resource shortages continue to plague families of the isolated communities","Islands and archipelagos, the world over, are distinctly developed and commercially advanced in the hopes of bolstering the tourism sector of the native country however, far from reaching the luxurious standard of popular holiday destinations, the islands of Baba and Bhit, outlining Pakistan’s coastal hub, Karachi, present a devastating picture, as thousands of indigenous households suffer endlessly in the absence of rudimentary necessities for survival like gas, water and healthcare.
Since their discovery during the colonial era, the twin islands of Baba and Bhit, lying a boat ride away from the port city, are home to a large community of fishermen, who predominantly rely on marine fisheries for maintaining their day-to-day livelihood. These fishermen and their families, known colloquially as the ‘Katchi’ communities, have been deprived of basic human and civil rights like tap water, education and even healthcare since time immemorial, presenting a challenge for locals, who require any of these facilities.
“There are no maternity facilities available for pregnant women in these islands. Therefore, any woman who requires a prenatal checkup or is in labor, has to first travel to Kemari on a boat before she can reach a hospital in the city,” revealed Razia Bibi, who urged the government to invest in adequate healthcare facilities in the islands, so that locals do not have to travel to the city for treatment.
According to Hasan Ali Bhatti, a social leader, the three centuries old islands of Baba and Bhit, which house a sizeable population of 35,000 people, have no state provided healthcare, education or tap water facilities.
“There is no laboratory, big hospital or maternity home in both these islands. Furthermore, only one school exists in each island, while colleges are entirely out of sight. The two islands have the worst water crisis, since water has to be supplied by boats, which sell the commodity at high prices,” informed Bhatti. Quite expectedly, the lack of sanitation facilities was evident in the high rate of infectious disease reported among the island’s locals, as Dr Rano Lohana, a doctor at the Bhit Shah Dispensary in Bhit Island, disclosed that skin and stomach diseases were highly common due to poor hygiene practices.
“Apart from the water crisis, our gas supply has also been suspended since over a year while electricity too had not been available over the past two weeks since we could not pay the bills. Over the past few years, due to sea pollution, the scale of our catch has decreased, landing us in a financial quandary. Therefore, we cannot pay exorbitant utility bills,” shared Muhammad Kachhi, a local fisherman, who anticipated what Ramazan would look like without the fundamental utilities.
Sympathizing with the fisherman, Salman Bhatti, Chairman of the Union Council of Bhat Island, agreed that the life of poor fishermen had become miserable due to the recent suspension of electricity and long-term unavailability of gas. “In the houses where earlier the electricity bill was Rs2000 to Rs2500, now the bills are RS10,000 to 15,000. How can a poor person be expected to pay such a huge amount,” questioned Bhatti. Even though, the supply of electricity was restored in recent times, the gas crisis continues to haunt locals, forcing many to adopt environmentally harmful practices like burning mangrove trees for fuel. “This is truly alarming. Mangrove trees help in reducing marine pollution, and deforestation will definitely threaten marine life,” warned, Moazzam Khan, Technical Advisor at the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF).
Speaking to the The Express Tribune on the matter, the spokespersons of K-Electric and the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), maintained that Rs729 million were due in electricity bills while 95 percent of the locals of the Baba and Bhit islands had not paid their gas bills. “The responsibility of determining the rates of electricity bills is not under the jurisdiction of the electricity distribution company,” justified the official from K-Electric. The administration only disconnects the connections of those households that have not paid their bills for a long time,” asserted the official from SSGC.

4,Larkana police rescue girl from child marriage,"Parents say were giving away 13-year-old in marriage due to poverty, SSP arranges Rs50,000 cash for the family","The Larkana police barged into a wedding ceremony and rescued a 13-year-old girl from child marriage on Sunday. On learning that the girl’s family was giving her away due to abject poverty, the Larkana district police chief authorized a grant of Rs50,000 on his discretion to provide some temporary support to the family.
The Larkana police took action on the report of marriage of 13 years old girl Aliya daughter of Khalid Hussain. Larkana district police chief SSP Syed Abdul Rahim Shirazi directed DSP Headquarters Sarfraz Ahmed and SHO Abdul Malik Bhutto and SHO Women Police Station to raid the house of Khalid Hussain to stop the wedding taking place in violation of the Sindh Child Marriage Act.
Police checked the B-Form of Aliya Khalid Hussain confirming her official age. The parents of the teenager girl told the police that they were giving away her child in marriage due to poor economic condition. On this, the SSP Larkana gave financial support of Rs50,000 to the girl’s parents. The Sindh Child Marriage Act enacted in 2013 prohibits the marriage of any child under the age of eighteen years and provides penalties for a male contracting party, the person who solemnizes the marriage as well as the parent or guardian concerned.
Sindh is the first province in Pakistan that passed the ’Sindh Marriage Restraint Act 2013’ with an aim to prevent solemnization of children’s marriages. However, eight years on, implementation of this law is still a great challenge for the authorities. Child rights expert Sarah Zaman has said that the operational gaps and challenges in the implementation and added that there are lacunas in the act, but its legitimacy is still there.
""Pakistan is in trauma due to the flood disaster, but on the other hand we face several cases of trafficking, rape, and child marriages,"" she said, adding that poverty is not the main reason for child marriages, other socio-political issues also need to be kept in mind while proposing amendments. Meanwhile, in March 2023, the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) in Islamabad, dismissed a petition challenging the vires of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013, which set the minimum age of marriage for both girls and boys at 18 years in the province. A full bench heard the petition filed by a citizen. The petitioner had claimed that the Act was un-Islamic and violated the injunctions of Islam.
