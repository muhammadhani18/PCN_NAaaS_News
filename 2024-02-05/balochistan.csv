0,Citizens slam CDA’s zoo revival bid,Wildlife experts say re-establishment of Islamabad zoo would violate IHC verdict,"Citizens and experts expressed their concern about the Capital Development Authority (CDA) moving to re-establish the Islamabad zoo in what they believe is a violation of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) verdict, in a meaningful discussion held on an online forum.
Their main objection was that in the absence of technical and financial capacity to regain the land required to establish a proper zoo facility, the CDA would attempt to keep the zoo animals caged in improper conditions, which they described as “the worst form of cruelty”.
The online discussion was organised by Development Communications Network (Devcom) Pakistan and DTN on Saturday afternoon.
During the discussion, the well-known biodiversity expert, Zahid Baig Mirza said, “The CDA cannot fool the cabinet to take a favourable decision on its summary in the presence of IHC verdict that had asked to end the cruelty against animals, and free the animals in their habitats”.
“The CDA’s attempt to re-establish the zoo in Islamabad by grabbing the land is a ‘mischievous’ act by the officials. They know they cannot do it except by misguiding the Federal Cabinet, but the biodiversity lovers will not support any uncalled-for decision by the CDA Board or the Federal Cabinet.”
Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) chairperson, Rina Saeed Khan, was of the view that the reopening of Islamabad Zoo should not be included in the agenda of the cabinet meeting without thoroughly consulting law and climate change ministries.
The now-closed Islamabad Zoo was handed over to Islamabad Wildlife Management Board in July 2019 by the Federal Cabinet by the IHC’s orders which were given following the deaths of almost all animals inside the old zoo.
She said, “In 2020 when the Islamabad Zoo was shut down by the landmark judgment of the IHC, the IWMB converted the site into the only wildlife rescue centre of its kind in Pakistan, helping all species of wild animals in distress.”
Since its formal inception in 2021, the centre has successfully rescued and rehabilitated approximately 381 animals. IWMB rescues orphaned and injured wildlife to implement the IHC order the specifically states that “No animal (shall be) treated in a manner that subjects it to unnecessary pain and suffering”.
Another senior biodiversity expert, Dr Ejaz Ahmed said, “Though zoos play an important role in education and awareness regarding different species and their behaviour, it is only the case if animals are kept with care.”
“But we have seen that due to poor management and lack of care, the majority of species are depressed and kept in a very unhygienic environment, which results in poor health conditions and abnormal behaviour in animals,” he explained.

1,Distribution of polling material begins in Pindi,"Police devise plan for transfer of materials from ICT to Pindi, Murree","The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has initiated the distribution of election materials in the Rawalpindi district in preparation for the upcoming 2024 elections.
The materials were initially transported to designated locations – a complex within the City police station’s jurisdiction and a government school in Murree, both under stringent police surveillance.
The ECP has said elections will be held on February 8, come what may.
Ensuring the safety of election materials, the Rawalpindi police has deployed officers in three shifts. The security duties are divided between Rawal SP Faisal Saleem overseeing Rawalpindi, and Saddar SP Nabil Khokhar responsible for Murree.
As the general election draws near, the final stages of preparation involve delivering polling materials to district returning officers. Rawalpindi police have devised a security plan, outlining specific points for the safe transfer of materials from Islamabad to Rawalpindi and Murree. Subsequently, the plan ensures secure delivery to polling stations and the return of materials to the returning officers on polling day.
Under the security plan, police officers, supervised by Rawal SP and Saddar SP, are assigned to safeguard the election materials. Regular technical sweeps will be conducted at both locations by the special branch.
A senior police officer confirmed to The Express Tribune that the Election Commission has commenced the delivery of election materials, with the initial consignment securely handed over to Rawalpindi. Security measures have been implemented during the delivery to the designated locations, ensuring the safe storage of the materials.

3,Stage set for NA-57 electoral showdown,Political bigwigs fail to ensure citizens’ campaign participation,"As voters brace for the upcoming general elections on February 8, the electoral landscape of the NA-57, spanning Rawalpindi’s urban, cantonment, and rural areas, promises an intriguing battle among candidates from various political affiliations.
The contest features candidates from Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), an independent female candidate supported by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Awami Muslim League (AML), Jamat-e-Islami (JI), and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), setting the stage for a closely watched electoral showdown.
Remarkably, this election marks a historic departure from conventional political fervour.
Notably absent are the flags of political parties adorning the rooftops, motorcycles, or vehicles across Rawalpindi city and cantonment. Equally striking is the absence of dedicated electoral offices, despite enticing offers. Previously, the election rallies at Liaquat Bagh have faltered in pulling huge crowds.
The public's non-participation in corner meetings has prompted candidates to try wedding-party-style gatherings with delectable food for participants.
With a total of 29 candidates in the fray, key contenders include Barrister Daniyal of PML-N, Mukhtar Abbas of PPP, independent woman candidate Seemabia Tahir Satti with PTI's backing, Sheikh Rashid Shafiq of AML, Mirza Khalid Mehmood of JI, Abdul Majid Hussain of JUI, Syed Rashid Hussain Shah of Pakistan Falah Party, and Chaudhry Rizwan Younis of TLP.
NA-57 boasts a voter count of 0.43, with 222,434 male voters and 209,077 female voters. The constituency encompasses 326 polling stations—156 for men, 155 for women, and 15 combined stations—supported by 780 polling booths, 398 for men and 382 for women. A team of 326 presiding officers, 1,560 assistant presiding officers, and 780 polling officers will oversee the electoral process.
Geographically, NA-57 includes sections of Chak Lala Cantonment, Tumhasimabad, Rahmabad, Scheme 3, Railway Colonies, City areas, Muslim Town, Khurram Colony, Chah Sultan, Duhok Khaba, Duhok Farman Ali, Chamanzar Colony, City, Shakrial one, two, and three, Khanna Dak one and two, and surrounding settlements.
While no indigenous community resides here, the constituency is home to a diverse population, including Rajas, Abbasis, Sattis, Chaudharys, Maliks, Sheikhs, and Kashmiris. Former PML-N adviser Chaudhry Sarfraz Afzal and Sheikh Arsalan Hafeez have expressed discontent over ticket distribution.
A unique aspect of this election is the candidates' individualistic approach, with many seeking votes for themselves rather than their party panels. Even candidates for provincial seats are individually campaigning for their positions. The electoral landscape is marked by various incentives, including flour, sugar, monetary gifts, and pots of biryani delivered to households.
However, candidates express astonishment at the overall lack of cooperation from the public, evident in the non-participation in corner meetings and the reluctance to offer services for polling agents. Door-to-door campaigns face challenges, with voters barely opening their doors to accept manifesto brochures without engaging fully with candidates' speeches. This election stands out in history as the first where candidates collectively experience a palpable sense of apprehension.
Previous winners of this seat include Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, Sheikh Rashid Shafiq, Imran Khan, and Hanif Abbasi.

4,Neck-and-neck fight expected in Pindi’s NA-56,AML’s Sheikh Rashid will contest polls from Adiala jail,"The National Assembly (NA) 56 constituency of Rawalpindi city is anxiously awaiting a neck-and-neck electoral contest among 31 candidates including political big guns Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, Hanif Abbasi and Shehryar Rizwan on February 8.
The constituency, labelled as the Lal Haeli constituency and is a hub of commercial activities, will have Sheikh Rashid of the AML, Hanif Abbasi of the PML-N, Shehryar Riaz of [the PTI], Sameera Gull of the PPP, Sajjad Akbar Abbasi of the TLP, Imran Shafiq of the JI, Sharjeel Mir of the IPP, and 21 independent candidates in the electoral fray.
Since 1985 Sheikh Rashid has completed a double hat-trick of electoral wins from this constituency, but this time the situation doesn’t look favourable for the former federal minister who is incarcerated in Adiala Jail and will contest the polls while remaining in jail.
The NA-56 has 523,683 voters, of which 272,459 are male voters and 251,274 are female voters. A total of 326 polling stations including 156 for men, 155 for women, and 15 joint polling stations have been established. As many as 31 polling stations have been declared sensitive. There are 780 polling booths out of which 398 are for men and 382 for women. A total of 371 Presiding Officers (POs), 1.880 Assistant Presiding Officers (AOs), and 940 Polling Officers (POs) have been appointed.
Major communities in the constituency are Sheikh, Chaudhary, Malik, Kashmiri, Khan, Rajgan, and Sadat, while religious voters are in good numbers. Locals don’t seem enthusiastic about political activities as corner meetings by candidates are seen without active participation, while residential and commercial properties lack displays of flags and banners. Even motorists and motorcyclists are not displaying flags of their favourite parties.
No large convoys from commercial centres participated in public rallies of the PML-N and the PPP at Liaquat Bagh. Business leaders and leading traders in the markets are seen avoiding physical contact with the candidates.
The AML chief will face the toughest election this time as he “lacks active political support”. His nephew Sheikh Rashid Shafique, who is contesting elections from NA-57, is burned with electoral campaigns of himself and Sheikh Rashid.
This is the first time the PML-N candidates have filed cases against their opponents during the campaign. PPP’s Samira Gill, who got her bail suspended in 2018, is trying her luck again.
PTI-backed Shehryar Riaz, who was elected MPA on the PML-N’s seat, quit the Nawaz-led party around seven years ago. He also organised PTI rallies in 2018, but this time he is contesting elections as an independent candidate because of a symbol issue. Though the JI and the TLP also have a reasonable vote bank in the constituency.
For the first time, Markazi Anjuman-e-Tajran president Sharjeel Mir is contesting on the ticket of the IPP, but his voters’ circle is limited to a few commercial markets.

5,Overcrowding forces bus route closure,Authorities said buses dedicated to the express route have been operationalised on normal routes,"The express route of the Rawalpindi Metro Bus service, which plies between Rawalpindi and Islamabad, has been closed to facilitate the increasing number of commuters on the normal route. The route earlier covered stoppage at seven designated bus stations.
Authorities said buses dedicated to the express route have been operationalised on normal routes for the convenience of passengers.
Some time ago, the Metro Bus service started operating the Express route from Saddar Rawalpindi to Pak Secretariat Islamabad. The buses stopped only at six to seven specific stations Chandni Chowk, Rahmanabad, Faizabad, and Faiz Ahmed Faiz, to pick up and drop passengers to reach their destination.
There are reports the route has been shut down because of a financial crisis. However, an officer of the Punjab Masstranist Authority (PMA) told The Express Tribune that the decision had been taken to cope with an increasing number of passengers travelling through the normal route covering all bus stops was continuously increasing.

7,Quest for change: Pind Dadan Khan at a crossroads,The transformative journey of region’s most backward tehsil is fraught with challenges,"Nestled amidst the heart of Punjab, the tehsil of Pind Dadan Khan has seen its population growth nearing 0.7 million.
Often labelled as the most backward tehsil in the region, Pind Dadan Khan is now at the centre stage of a transformative narrative, shaped by both challenges and aspirations.
At the epicentre of this tale stands the ambitious dual carriageway Jhelum Road project, a vision set in motion three years ago by the then federal minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain better known as Fawad Chaudhry. Backed by a substantial budget of Rs16 billion, this venture, though commendable, faced a stumbling block — a shortfall in funding that cast a shadow over its completion.
Championed by Chaudhry, the road project, along with the trauma centre in Toba, the passport office, and the EOBI office in Pind Dadan Khan City, symbolises the vigour of his leadership.
The wheels of development also set in motion with the initiation of the Jalalpur-Kundwal Canal during Chaudhry’s tenure, marking a promising chapter in the region’s progress. Yet, the journey to completion of these endeavours has been fraught with challenges.
Despite the commendable efforts, projects linger in delays, awaiting the release of full funds. Only the Jalalpur-Kundwal canal, with the backing of the World Bank, forges ahead, signalling hope for the tehsil’s future.
Beyond the infrastructure hurdles, the tehsil grapples with the critical issues of drainage and clean drinking water. The failure of the sewage system, introduced by former MPA Chaudhry Nazar Hussain Gondal, reveals a need for larger pipes. The absence of a sanitation and drainage system compounds the woes, highlighting the collective responsibility of the community and the Municipal Committee.
The Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, a vital lifeline for the community, faces its own set of challenges. A lack of specialist doctors, attributed to inadequate accommodations, leaves residents without essential medical care. Outdated medical equipment further exacerbates the situation, leaving the hospital functioning as more of a “post office” than a healthcare facility.
As one navigates through the myriad issues plaguing the city – from Wapda hanging wires to the precarious drop in gas pressure – it begs the question: Who shoulders the responsibility for the tehsil’s backwardness?
The call to action resonates – it is time to select representatives committed to eradicating backwardness, representatives who transcend mere photo sessions and embody true sincerity.
Amidst the shadows of neglect, Pind Dadan Khan’s potential flickers. A reflection in the neighbouring districts of Mandi Bahauddin and Chakwal serves as a stark reminder of what is achievable.
It beckons the residents to look beyond political affiliations and make informed choices, for in the power of their votes lies the transformative key to propel Pind Dadan Khan into a future unbound by backwardness.

8,Call to transform agri trade with innovation,SDPI report terms digital solutions crucial for food security,"In a recent report launch, speakers emphasised the critical role of innovative indigenous solutions and the digital integration of agricultural data in unlocking the potential of regional agriculture trade.
This approach is seen as crucial for supporting progress towards food security and the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG2). The report, titled “Potential of Innovation for Food Security and Regional Trade in Agriculture,” was unveiled by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in collaboration with the Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI).
SDPI Joint Executive Director, Dr Vaqar Ahmed, addressed the audience and highlighted the impact of recurrent climate events, pandemics, and supply chain disruptions on food security in Pakistan and the broader region. He stressed that agricultural productivity and regional food security can be enhanced through technological innovations and the strengthening of regional agricultural trade.
Dr Ahmed pointed out that the 2022 floods had severely affected the ability of 73% of households in flood-affected areas to afford basic nutrition, impeding progress towards SDG2. The situation was even direr in Afghanistan, where 95% of the population struggled to meet their nutritional demands. The hackathon, organised by SDPI, provided a platform for start-ups to network, showcase their ideas, and contribute to advancing regional agriculture trade integration and food security.
Dr Haroon Sarwar, Economic Consultant at the Ministry of National Food Security & Research, commended SDPI’s initiative to host a Hackathon in 2023 focused on start-ups working in food security. He highlighted the positive signs of participation from start-ups in Balochistan and Afghanistan, indicating a promising outlook for food security. Dr Sarwar emphasised that addressing the challenges faced by agriculture in Pakistan and the region, particularly the poor access of smallholding farmers to finances, could significantly improve profitability and reduce food insecurity. He called for bridging the gap between small farmers and financial institutions.
Dr Sarwar also emphasised the untapped potential for agriculture trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan, acknowledging existing barriers and proposing collaborative efforts between SDPI and the Ministry of Food Security and Research to overcome these obstacles.
Dr Samreen Babar, Associate Professor at Bahria University, applauded the Hackathon organised by SDPI for providing a platform for students and start-ups to present their innovative ideas and connect with mentors. She stressed the importance of bridging the gap between academia, start-ups, mentors, and partners to foster innovative indigenous solutions.
Dr Babar proposed the development of a mobile application facilitating bilateral agriculture trade by connecting buyers and sellers, thereby boosting food security and supporting economic development.
Rija Tayyab, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Manager at Roshan Packages emphasised the significant stake that the youth have in addressing the climate crisis. She highlighted the need to enhance the capacity of youth to propose indigenous solutions for climate-induced challenges.
Tayyab stressed the importance of developing mechanisms to scale up these solutions for effective implementation.

9,"Chicken, egg prices continue to rise",Prices of poultry items have increased by 20 per cent in the twin cities,"The price of poultry chicken reached Rs460 per kg and the price of poultry eggs reached Rs415 per dozen in the open market in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
The meat of the poultry chicken has reached Rs800 to Rs810 per kg in the open market, according to a survey. The price of poultry chickens and eggs has been going above Rs415 to Rs420 per kg and dozen for the past few months, which is getting away from the purchasing power of consumers day by day.
The prices of poultry items have increased by 20 per cent in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi during the last month, which has created huge volatility in the market.
According to the market survey, during the last three in the twin cities, a 25 per cent increase was witnessed in the price of poultry chicken, while as same as 35 per cent increase in the price of poultry eggs in the same period.
Meanwhile, former Pakistan Poultry Association (PPA) Chairman, Dr Sajjad Arshad, said the increase in the current prices of poultry was due to demand and supply issues. He said the increase in poultry business inputs and cost of doing business was seen across the country due to which the market was in crisis.
He added that many people related to the chicken business in the country were affected by the current crisis and especially small businesses and poultry farms were closed. Sajjad said that the country’s economic conditions were also an important issue and the poultry feed ingredients imported from foreign countries were very expensive, in which soybean is important. He said many soybean ships stopped at Karachi port, which had an inevitable impact on poultry prices.
The PPA has also called for a further increase in the prices of chicken and there was an increase observed in the prices of poultry items in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
