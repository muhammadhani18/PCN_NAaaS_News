0,Fazl criticises Imran’s prison requests,"Claims ex-PM wants exercise bike, AC unit and jail wall","At a significant political rally held in Bannu Sports Complex, Maulana Fazl Rehman, the Central Amir of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazal (JUI-F), criticized former prime minister Imran Khan, alleging that he had requested special amenities like an air-conditioning unit and an exercise bike in prison, likening him to a delicate ‘rooster’ incapable of enduring harsh conditions.
Fazl also accused former chief minister of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pervaiz Khattak, of amending accountability laws to evade potential arrest under the same legislation.
He stated that PTI’s chief minister initially introduced an accountability law in K-P, but later amended it when he feared potential repercussions, thereby altering the accountability act.
Asserting his party’s vision, Fazl pledged to transform Pakistan into a true Islamic state if voted into power, contrasting it with the current perception of the country as secular. He emphasized JUI-F’s commitment to inclusive politics, extending support even to non-Muslims, and highlighted the party’s longstanding presence and influence in Bannu over the past six decades.

3,Mardan prepares for battle of titans,ANP’s Amir Haider Hoti squares off against PTI’s Atif Khan,"Election fever grips Mardan as the district braces for a highly anticipated showdown between political heavyweights in the upcoming 2024 general elections.
The spotlight is on the fiercely contested national assembly constituency NA-22 Mardan-II, where former Chief Minister Ameer Haider Khan Hoti squares off against PTI-backed former Provincial Minister Atif Khan.
With a mere six days remaining until polling day, political parties and independent candidates have kicked their campaigns into high gear, engaging in a flurry of rallies, corner meetings, and door-to-door canvassing efforts. Leveraging the power of social media and national newspaper advertisements, they vie for the attention and support of Mardan’s electorate.
All eyes are fixed on the electoral battleground of NA-22 Mardan-II, where ANP has pinned its hopes on former chief minister Hoti, while PTI rallies behind the candidacy of Atif Khan.
The contest is expected to be intense, given Hoti’s previous victories in 2013 and 2018, where he secured the seat with 44,769 and 78,911 votes, respectively, narrowly defeating his PTI rival by a slim margin of 35 votes in the latter election.
As the political rivals vie for support from influential clans and communities, the electoral landscape of Mardan unfolds with multiple contenders across various constituencies.
In NA-21 Mardan-I, former MNA Mujahid Khan, now an independent candidate, faces off against candidates from ANP, PPP, and JUI-F. Mujahid Khan’s previous victories in 2013 and 2018 underscore his electoral prowess, having secured successive wins against competitors from JUI-F and ANP.

4,Democratic exercise : Election day turnout in K-P may dwindle,"Terrorism threat, cold weather, and crackdown on PTI will discourage voters from showing up","With barely a few days left in the general election, turnout for the democratic exercise in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) is expected to be lower compared to previous elections owing to multiple factors.
Populace of the northwestern province, which is home to sixteen per cent of National Assembly seats of the country, might not turn out to vote in large droves come February 8th due to an increase in terrorism, target killings, and large scale arrests of the supporters and leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
K-P was rocked with 631 instances of terrorism in the preceding year, 2023, and so far this year 23 incidents of terrorism have been reported in the southern and tribal districts of the province. In this regard, a retired official of the armed forces, Mehmood Shah, who is an independent security expert, told The Express Tribune that increasing attacks in the province, especially by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), suggest that election day will be violent.
“Even in the last general election, the TTP targeted ANP, and this time around we have seen the organisation target Jamiat-e-Ulema Islam Fazl (JUI-F). Therefore elections will need to be conducted with a foolproof security plan to avoid any untoward incident,” he elaborated.
However, whether the security plan is foolproof or not, the security expert predicted that due to the threat of terrorism, the populace in the southern and tribal districts of the province would not turn out in large numbers.
Apart from the terrorism threat, the crackdown on PTI, after the May 9th protests, might serve as a deterrent for voting as well, especially for those who support the party and wish to vote for it. This deterrence might also have exacerbated ever since the founding chairman of the party, Imran Khan, was convicted in two separate criminal cases. In this regard, Dr Shah Nawaz, assistant professor in the political science department of Islamia College, Peshawar, was of the view that turnout in the election would indeed decrease in the upcoming general election compared to the 2018 general election. “There are other reasons for why the turnout may be low as well. Firstly, the extremely cold weather in the upper regions. Secondly, people have lost hope in the system and might not wish to vote,” Dr Nawaz explained.
It is pertinent to mention that election turnout has already seen a downward trend in the province. As per the Election Commission of Pakistan, the turnout in the elections held in the country in 2013 was more than 55 per cent, however, in the 2018 general elections, the turnout decreased to between 50 to 51 per cent.
