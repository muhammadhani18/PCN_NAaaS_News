1,Series of Kashmir solidarity events lined up,Competitions organised in University College of Art and Design on eve of Kashmir Solidarity Day,"A series of events has been organsied by the Islamia University of Bahawalpur to express solidarity with the Kashmiri people.
Painting and poster competitions were organised in the University College of Art and Design on the eve of the Kashmir Solidarity Day marked on February 5.
Bahawalpur Division Commissioner Dr Ehtesham Anwar, who was the chief guest on the occasion, appreciated the creative work of teachers and students depicting the spirit of freedom of the Kashmiri people on the canvas in a beautiful way. He said art is one of the best ways to highlight the issue of Kashmir at the global level, through which serious violations of human rights can be brought to international forums.
Vice Chancellor Dr Naveed Akhtar said that Kashmir’s struggle for self-determination is recognised at the international level. The people of Pakistan will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of the region until the conflict is resolved according to the UN resolution through a census.
Pakistanis have pledged to support Kashmiris in their struggle for freedom. The 700,000 soldiers deployed in Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir cannot suppress the struggle of Kashmiris. Kashmiris will get their right to self-determination for which the entire Pakistani nation stands behind them, he added.

2,Jumping on the bandwagon : Parties go big on campaigning anthems,Large number of mainstream parties have fervidly invested in composing catchy campaigning tracks,"Anthems, through their poetic lyrics and memorable melodies, are a discreet yet enterprising way of delivering a captivating political message to the balloting citizenry.
Thus, in recent times, a large number of mainstream parties in the country have fervidly invested in the composition of catchy campaigning tracks that are sure to have brainwashed voters subconsciously dancing to their tunes come Election Day.
With the preparations for the General Elections 2024 in full swing, many political parties including the Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N), Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) have followed suit of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) by orchestrating an expansive music production arrangement, which includes live and recorded song performances by renowned singers and lyricists like Sahir Ali Bagga, Malkoo, Farhan NTF and Mazhar Rahi, whose quirky hip-hop party anthems played repeatedly during election gatherings, rallies and advertisements, hold the potentiality to not only elevate the spirits of the listeners but also to surreptitiously alter their political allegiances with striking subtlety by leaving them in a partially hypnotic state.
“Since music is a highly effective tool for brainwashing people, it has been used extensively across time and space by leaders and revolutionists, who hoped to unite people under a special cause or social movement. A look back at history shows that music has played an important role in the success of many revolutions and movements in the world,” analyzed Dr Hannan, a psychologist.
According to sources of The Express Tribune, special arrangements have been made by parties for playing the anthems in their rallies and campaigns at the appropriate time in order to amplify the effect of a particular word or phrase spoken by the leader during their speech.
Adeem Anwar, a connoisseur of the arts, expressed his belief that tunes and melodies have a profound effect on the human mood. “There is a reason that music is called the food of the soul.
If a person listens to a sad song, they might start feeling depressed. Conversely, if someone listens to an upbeat song with a fast melody, a transfer of energy occurs, and the person feels uplifted. Hence, it is seen how the loud music and sentimental lyrics of songs played during election rallies, keep the supporters ‘charged’ for the elections,” observed Anwar, who felt that music was a smart way of attracting the youth of the country, which comprised 63 per cent of the population, to the polls.
Precedent supports Anwar’s assessment when one looks retrospectively at the PTI’s journey towards gaining popularity among the youth of the country. Indeed, PTI was the first mainstream party to introduce the use of originally produced music in Pakistan’s politics during its rally in October 2011 at the Minar-e-Pakistan and from there on it has continued to produce several party anthems featuring the voices of famous musicians like Abrarul Haq, Salman Ahmad and Ataullah Khan Esakhelvi.
Imtiaz Sheikh, former President of PTI Lahore proudly rejoiced that PTI had given a new color to political rallies and processions in Pakistan through its usage of revolutionary songs.
“Initially, people were criticizing PTI for promoting the music and dance culture (indecency), but now all major parties are using a similar strategy,” scoffed Sheikh.
Talking to The Express Tribune on the matter, Khawaja Imran Nazeer, the central leader of PML-N Lahore, which has organized the biggest music campaign this year, said, “Playing songs during election campaigns helps in increasing the enthusiasm of the voters, especially the youth.”

3,Seat adjustment causes complication in NA-88,PML-N makes way for former PTI leader representing IPP,"The National Assembly constituency NA-88 comprising of the Noorpur Thal and Quaidabad tehsils of Khushab district is witnessing a contest among 14 candidates in this week’s general elections.
The Pakistan Muslim League-N has not issued a party ticket for the constituency because of seat adjustment with the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP). Malik Gul Asghar Baghwar, a former member of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, is contesting for the IPP.
However, former MPA Malik Moazzam Sher Kallu, who had sought the PML-N ticket, decided to run independently after not receiving the party endorsement.

The constituency has 451,000 voters, including 236,000 women and 215,000 men, for whom 936 polling booths will be set up.

The key contenders include Sardar Ali Hussain Baloch of PML-N, Ehsanullah Tiwana of IPP, Amjad Raza Gujjar backed by PTI, Waris Jasra of Jamaat-e-Islami and Sher Muhammad Sialvi of Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan. Ehsanullah Tiwana, who had been elected MNA on PTI's ticket in 2018, is now contesting for the provincial assembly under the IPP banner. Ali Hussain Baloch, once his ally, is now a rival. PP-83 has 237,293 voters.

7,‘Gender equality to boost economy’,PFC CEO says gender gap harming national as well global growth,"Countries with greater gender inequality can increase their economic output by 35 per cent on average by closing the gap in women's participation in the labour force, Pakistan Furniture Council (PFC) Chief Executive Officer Mian Kashif Ashfaq said on Sunday.
Talking to a delegation of women entrepreneurs, he said, ""We have to narrow the gender gap, which is harming the national as well global growth.""
He said keeping women out of economic opportunities is unfair and also hampers growth and resilience for all.""Over time, gender-sensitive macroeconomic and financial policies will result in higher growth, greater economic stability and resilience, and lower income inequality -- a dividend not just for women but for everyone,"" he added.
He said that out of 190 countries surveyed, the World Bank had found that women had equal legal standing with men in just 12 states, which spoke of the sorry state of affairs worldwide.
Mian Kashif mentioned that according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the gender-based discrimination in social institutions costs the world economy $6 trillion but in recent years countries have reduced these costs through social and legal actions such as curbing underage marriages, criminalizing domestic violence and increasing the number of female elected officials.
