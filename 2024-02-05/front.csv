0,Shrine families: Gaddi Nasheens’ hold on voter base slipping away,Traditional shrine families face challenges as social media alters voting dynamics,"At the crossroads of electoral change, Gaddi Nasheen Pirs, traditionally seen as architects of the nation’s political story, are now redefining their roles with socio-economic transformations. A journey that dates back to the Mughal era is undergoing recalibration by these spiritual leaders.
Traditionally aligned with power centres, the heirs of the saintly lineage, representing the traditional Barelvi school, face the challenge of syncing with evolving public sentiments. The historic sway they held over ‘mureeds’ (disciples) is now encountering a reshaped political terrain, necessitating direct engagement with voters.
Many prominent Gaddis have shown a tendency to switch electoral allegiances when deemed necessary. Their influence has traditionally hinged on the unwavering support of their ‘mureeds’ who adhered to the voting recommendations of their spiritual leaders. However, as the population grew and constituency sizes expanded, Pirs found themselves compelled to actively engage with voters to secure their support.
In electoral politics traditionally, their sphere of influence extended to rural areas, primarily in Punjab and Sindh provinces, where most major Gaddis are located.
While historically rooted in rural strongholds, the political landscape has morphed, turning villages into towns and rural spaces into semi-urban hubs. The proliferation of social media, economic prosperity, and improved education accessibility have redrawn the contours of influence.
While there hasn’t been an independent study to precisely gauge the impact of these socio-economic changes on the Pirs’ vote bank, a closer look at the country’s recent electoral history reveals potent challenges in maintaining their political influence alongside spiritual standing.
These challenges have intensified, particularly since the last general elections, with the emergence of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a hardline Barelvi party founded to tackle the issue of preserving the Namoos-e-Risalat (ensuring the utmost respect for the Prophet PBUH) and protect the country’s blasphemy laws – issues that are highly sensitive for Barelvis.

The rising influence of TLP poses a serious threat to the traditional stronghold that Gaddi Nasheens have maintained over their followers in electoral matters. The transformation in the political landscape, coupled with the growing resonance of TLP’s messaging, prompts an exploration into whether Gaddi Nasheens’ historical influence on the electoral choices of their followers is now under renewed scrutiny.
In the last elections, TLP presented a significant surprise. The party, founded in 2015 on the back of support for the issue of hanging Mumtaz Qadri, a serving police bodyguard of sitting Punjab governor Salman Taseeer, TLP secured 2.2 million votes in the 2018 general elections and won two provincial assembly seats in Sindh.
Moreover, it altered the outcome in around 20 National Assembly seats, where winning margins were less than TLP votes. The hardline party also influenced results in another 17 constituencies, securing second place in three National Assembly constituencies and standing at number three in around 70 constituencies for the National Assembly and provincial assemblies of Punjab and Sindh.
These results showcased an unprecedented influence of the Barelvi vote that had never been pronounced in the past like this. While Jamiat Ulma-e-Pakistan (JUP) and some other Barelvi parties in the past secured few seats and influenced voting patterns in certain pockets, TLP demonstrated a much broader countrywide impact.
As the upcoming elections approach, questions arise about TLP’s performance without a singular agenda item, unlike in 2018 when they campaigned to protect the country’s blasphemy laws and the finality of prophethood.
Reports suggest that TLP back then also enjoyed tacit support from influential quarters to challenge PML-N, which had fallen out with the powers that be of the country.
This time PML-N seems to be the first choice of powerful quarters to form the next government. It has made alliances and seat adjustments with a number of parties and groups to ensure its dominance in the centre and Punjab.
TLP has fielded 223 candidates for the national assembly, more than PML-N’s 212 and PPP’s 219 across Pakistan for the 266 directly elected seats. In the absence of their firebrand leader Allama Khadim Rizvi and the aforementioned issues, it is yet to be seen if TLP will act as a fringe party in this month’s polls or if it emerges as a serious player capturing the votes of major parties and the majority Barelvi vote on which Pirs traditionally had their banking.
Amidst the prevailing uncertainty, spiritual leaders, the Pirs, are delicately navigating the intricate balance between tradition and contemporary dynamics. The backdrop of this electoral scenario witnesses a significant shift in traditional patterns of choices of Pirs. Below is a summary of influential Gaddis and their party preferences for the upcoming elections.
Shrine Bahu Sultan – Central Punjab (Jhang)
This shrine holds considerable sway in Jhang’s political landscape. Notable Pirs: Sahibzada Mehboob Sultan and Sahibzada Amir Sultan and contesting for National Assembly seats NA-108 and NA-110 respectively.
Shah Jeevna – Jhang
The Gaddi Nasheen of a significant shrine in Jhang former federal minister Faisal Saleh Hayat is contesting for National Assembly and Punjab Assembly seats NA-108 and PP-125 on a PML-N ticket after leaving PPP a few weeks back.
Shrine of Sial Sharif – Sargodha
In the court’s electoral politics especially in Punjab’s politics, this shrine has historical significance. Gaddi Nasheens of this shrine have also been elected multiple times for the National and Provincial legislatures. Pir Naeem Uddin Sialvi is contesting for the Punjab Assembly seat in the upcoming elections. He was PTI’s candidate for National Assembly in 2018 but he joined PPP in January 2022.
Taunsa Sharif – South Punjab
Khawaja Sheraz and other members of this significant Gaddi in South Punjab are contesting for the National Assembly and Punjab Assembly. Sheraz would be contesting for National Assembly seat NA-183. He is backed by PTI. His uncle Khawaja Salah Uddin Akbar is contesting from PP-285, another close relative Khawja Nizam ul Mehmood is contesting on the PML-N ticket while another family member Khawja Muddasir is contesting for the National Assembly seat on JUI-F ticket.
Dargah Jalalpur Sharif – Central Punjab
Central Punjab shrine with political importance has also played an important role in the country’s politics in the past, however no direct descendant in the current race for the national legislature.
Gilanis of Multan
PPP’s face in South Punjab, former prime minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani is contesting from NA-148, while his sons Ali Musa Gillani from NA-151, and Abdul Qadir Gillani from NA-152.
Shrine Bahauddin Zakariya Multan
Former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi is currently in jail and has been convicted along with PTI founder Imran Khan under the official secret act in the Cypher case.  His son Zain Qureshi is contesting from NA-150, while his daughter Mehr Bano Qureshi will be facing Ali Musa Gillani in NA-151. They are independent candidates backed by PTI.
Shrine Khawaja Fareed Pakpattan
Two important politicians who derive their support from Gaddi Nasheens of this shrine, the brothers of Khawar Manika, former husband of Imran Khan’s wife, Ahmed Manika and Farooq Manika are contesting on PML-N ticket for NA-139, and PP-193 respectively.
Dargah Hazuri Kasuri – Central Punjab
Gaddi Nasheen of this shrine, Pir Imran Ahmed Shah is contesting for the National Assembly on PML-N ticket from Sahiwal.
Pir Amin ul Hasnaat of Bhera Sharif who contested the last election on the PTI platform is not in the race this time.
Important Gaddi’s of Sindh province in the run for 2024 elections:
Bharchundi Dargah, Ghotki
Mian Abdul Haq Mitthu who is widely accused of forced conversions of non-Muslims is contesting for the National Assembly seat from Ghotki.
Gaddi Nasheens from Khairpur
Pir Niaz Hussain Shah representing Gaddi of Pirs of Rani will be facing Pir Sadaruddin Shah Rashdi of Pir Pagara family for NA-203. Two other members of the Pagara family Pir Ismail Shah Rashdi are running for Sindh Assembly’s seat PS-28 and Pir Rashid Shah Rashdi for PS-31 on GDA tickets.
Hala Shrine
Sajada Nasheeen of this shrine Makhdoom Jamil ul Zaman is contesting from NA-216 Mityari while Makhdoom Mehboob Zaman is in the contest for PS-56 on PPP tickets.
The diverse range of political parties on whose platforms these Gaddi Nasheens are vying for seats illustrates a shift in traditional political dynamics. Historically, political parties would seek the endorsement of Pirs for their support. However, the current scenario reflects a reversal, indicating that Pirs now actively seek party tickets to maintain their relevance in the evolving political landscape.
The choices of these influential Gaddi Nasheens are poised to shape the political landscape after the elections, providing a nuanced interplay between tradition, spirituality, and contemporary political dynamics.
Sabookh Syed, a journalist and researcher closely monitoring issues related to religious parties and extremist groups, notes that Gaddi Nasheens have traditionally aligned themselves with the powers that be, playing on their whims.

At the same time, these Pirs have typically prioritized local interests over any party’s national ideology. They often sided with a party that caters to their local concerns, given that their economic ties revolve around local groups and parties.
More organised religious parties of the Deobandi school of thought, such as Jammat-e-Islami and JUI-F, have been criticising the Pirs for using the Namoos-e-Risalat issues publicly while supporting secular parties like PPP and PML-N, who, at times make attempts aimed to amend laws on matters dear to Barelvis.
He believes the emergence of TLP has posed a challenge for many Pirs. TLP, by championing the cause of Khatam-e-Nabuwwat, has shifted the dynamics by becoming the self-proclaimed sole guardian of laws related to the finality of the Prophet (PBUH).
Instead of making any other traditional Gaddi as the centre of their politics, they propagated Mumtaz Qadri’s ideology, with his shrine at the centre, and after the demise of the party founder Allama Khadim Rizvi, they integrated his shrine into their assertive political stance.
Dr Adeel Malik, an academician at Oxford University, offers a different perspective. He suggests that the power of traditional shrine families is increasingly contested due to the penetration of social media and the breakup of household votes.
“The upcoming elections provide an important avenue to test how these new influences are eating into the vote banks of powerful Gaddis,” says Dr Malik.

1,10 cops martyred in brazen DI Khan attack,Terrorists target police station in Daraban tehsil on Monday morning,"In an escalation of violence days before the upcoming general elections, at least ten policemen including members of an elite force were martyred on Monday in a brazen attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s (K-P) restive Dera Ismail Khan district.
According to officials, dozens of terrorists attacked the Chaudhwan police station located in the district’s Daraban tehsil first with sniper guns. The attack started at 3 am, as reported by Reuters.
""More than 30 terrorists launched the attack from three directions,"" K-P provincial police chief Akhtar Hayat Gandapur told AFP. ""There was an exchange of fire for over two-and-a-half hours.""
The attackers later entered the building, firing with automatic weapons and lobbing hand grenades, resulting in the deaths of ten policemen and injuries to at least six others. The Chaudhwan police station’s station house officer (SHO), however, remained unharmed.
Daraban Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Malik Aneesul Hassan told Reuters that most of the police casualties occurred due to grenade blasts.
Speaking to Express News, the DSP identified the martyred as four personnel of the K-P Elite Police Force— Assistant Sub-Inspectors (ASIs) Kausar, Ihtiram, Rafiullah, and Hamidul Haq. A platoon of Elite Force from Swabi was deployed at the police station, he added.
Other martyred policemen were Muhammad Islam, Ghulam Fareed, Muhammad Javaid, Muhammad Idris, Muhammad Imran, and Mansoor. The injured included Ahmad Hussain, Akbar Zaman, Anayatullah, Sohrab Khan, Ibrahim, and Nasib Khan.
Upon receiving reports of the attack, heavy contingents of police rushed to the police station. Security forces cordoned off the area and initiated a search operation in surrounding areas, including forests.
They established pickets on roads leading to South Waziristan, Drazanda, and Dera Ghazi Khan. The Pakistan Army was later deployed for the security of the police station.
Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar ""strongly condemned"" the attack. ""The entire nation stands with the police and security forces and salutes the martyrs,"" he said in a statement.

A senior government official informed AFP about the ""severe threat"" in southern areas of the K-P, where Monday's assault took place.
""Terrorists have now begun to blend in with civilian populations in urban areas, making it difficult to conduct operations against them,"" the official said, requesting anonymity.
It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack and whether it was related to the election. On Wednesday, a National Assembly candidate was shot dead elsewhere in K-P, while another political leader was shot dead in his party's election office in Balochistan.
On Tuesday, a bomb attack following an election rally killed four people in Balochistan. The Islamic State terrorist group claimed responsibility.
In December, at least 23 soldiers were killed when a six-man suicide squad drove an explosive-laden truck into a military camp set up in a police station complex, also in Daraban.
Pakistan has seen a resurgence of attacks by terrorists, especially targeting security personnel, since 2022, when a ceasefire between the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the government broke down.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) last week confirmed that general elections would proceed as planned after holding an urgent meeting with security officials following a spate of violence in the K-P and Balochistan provinces.
Daraban lies in an area considered a stronghold of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F). The party chief, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, traveled last month to Afghanistan to meet the Taliban's supreme spiritual leader, one of his few known meetings with foreign dignitaries.
The party has also called for a delay in Pakistan's polls due to security concerns.

2,"Rain or shine, Bilawal vows to wash away Karachi’s woes",PPP chairman says city will be given representation it deserves in Sindh cabinet," 
As the downpour showered both criticism and opportunity on PPP's decade-long rule, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Monday sought to inject vigour into his rain-battered campaign, offering an umbrella of promises to remedy the metropolis’ long-festering governance issues – a problem laid bare once again by showers amid electioneering heat.
The Bhutto scion promised that if Karachi elected PPP candidates from 20 National Assembly seats, the city's landscape would be unrecognisable within five years, turning its fortunes around.
His statement came as Karachi – his party’s fortress – came to a standstill due to rain amid the electoral campaign. Three people lost their lives due to the heavy rainfall, which also resulted in flooding in both residential and commercial areas of the city. This led to power outages and the failure of the traffic management system.
Reacting to Karachi's urban flooding, PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, earlier taunted by Bilawal on governance, quipped that if Lahore mirrored Karachi's situation after rain, he would have withdrawn from the electoral race!
Thank you Kemari! I am a son of Karachi and want to do great things for our city. The people of Karachi want an end to the ethnic and religious division and hatred that has held the progress of this city ransom for decades. A vote for the Peoples Party is a vote to end it once… pic.twitter.com/Pu4FENNzZu
‘Change for 20 NA seats’
As part of his electoral campaign, Bilawal addressed the public in various areas of Karachi on Monday, delivering speeches in the form of rallies.
Speaking at a gathering in Keamari’s PT Ground, he expressed his vision for the city, emphasising the potential changes that would take place if the people choose PPP representatives.
""If the people of Karachi elect my representatives, then like local government, the provincial government will also be in our hands, and with your votes, even the federal government will be in our hands,"" Bilawal declared during his speech.
""Give 20 [NA] seats to PPP, and then within five years, we will change Karachi. We will form our government at the federal level and work on historic projects in Karachi. This city will be given representation as it deserves.""
Bilawal assured that the provincial cabinet of Sindh would grant Karachi its due rights, and together, they would serve the city. He urged the residents of the city to be aware and not vote for those who seek to divide and spread hatred based on religion or language.
The PPP chairman remarked that on February 8th, people should vote against all elements that indulge in politics of hatred and violence. He expressed confidence that their elected representatives would work in the city, providing opportunities for progress and ensuring equal opportunities for women.
""My and my mother's birth took place in Karachi. This city is like my home, and serving Karachi means serving my home. I will serve my home in the best possible way, and I will instruct your representatives to stand by you in every joy and sorrow,"" Bilawal added.

‘No alliance post-polls’
Separately, the former foreign minister ruled out the possibility of forming an alliance with PML-N following polls.
“It [PML-N] is no longer a party that says [the slogan] respect the vote (vote ko izzat do) or that agrees to Charter of Democracy but rather it has become the one which was part of IJI,” Bilawal said in an interview with Voice of America
IJI or Islami Jamhoori Ittehad was an alliance formed in 1988 to oppose the PPP in the elections that year. It comprised nine parties including the PML-N, which at that time was called PML.
""This is the PML-N that dreams of becoming 'Amir-ul-Momineen,' so it is very difficult for me to continue with the PML-N.""
He accused Nawaz of exerting pressure on the administration to manipulate the elections, alleging that the caretaker government and administration were favouring the former prime minister.
“The caretaker prime minister was appointed following deliberations between Shehbaz Sharif and Raja Riaz and now Raja Riaz was contesting elections on a PML-N ticket,” he added.
Expressing concern over the arrest of their supporters in Sindh by FIA, Bilawal said that attempts by PML-N to divide the political structure would fail.

To reduce the role of the establishment in politics, Bilawal suggested that the first step must be taken by politicians themselves, urging political leaders to confine their differences within the political arena.
The former foreign minister emphasised that politicians should adhere to the rules and principles of politics. “If we don’t work within our limits and cross it then we should not expect others not to cross their limits as well,” he said in an apparent reference to the military establishment.
Bilawal pointed out that the May 9 incident was not within the boundaries of politics and stressed the need for politicians to establish a code of conduct and all should adhere to it.

""If Nawaz Sharif becomes the prime minister, we will see what ideology he pursues. The PML-N is currently pursuing politics of hatred and division. If Nawaz Sharif wants to leave this path, he should abandon this policy,” he said.
Bilawal said that the party wanted transparent elections and hoped that despite Nawaz Sharif's pressure, the caretaker government would not interfere in the elections.
