0,Karachi grapples with rain havoc,Citizens stranded on inundated roads; electioneering disrupted,"Saturday's downpour in the metropolis wreaked havoc, literally paralysing the routine life. The repercussions lingered into Sunday, witnessing thousands stranded overnight on rain-drenched streets, leaving behind damaged vehicles and disrupted routines.
The deluge crippled Karachi for several hours, with flooded roads and accumulated sewage creating widespread difficulties. Election activities took a back seat as political parties shifted focus to door-to-door campaigning amidst the chaos.
The one-hour rain on Saturday swamped the entire city, affecting both main roads and inner streets. Pedestrians faced challenges navigating waterlogged areas, with thousands forced to abandon their vehicles, leading to extensive damage to motorcycles.
Disturbingly, exorbitant rickshaw fares, reaching up to Rs2,000 for short distances, added to citizens' plight.
Despite the dire situation, the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) failed to implement adequate water drainage measures. The city mayor's visits to different areas revealed a scene of destruction, highlighting the inefficacy of local government representatives, including town supervisors from various political affiliations.
Rescue services, especially Rescue 1122, were conspicuously absent during the crisis, exacerbating the challenges faced by citizens. Sindh Solid Waste Management Board's failure to provide relief further compounded the situation.
The rain not only disrupted daily life but also cast a shadow over political activities. Political parties postponed scheduled events, while the TLP convened a meeting to assess the situation.
Elected local government representatives found themselves in a challenging position as citizens criticised their response, opening opportunities for rival political parties to exploit the situation.
As Karachi gears up for the upcoming general elections, the rain-induced difficulties pose a challenge for political parties seeking votes. While the long-term impact on the political landscape remains uncertain, the immediate aftermath paints a grim picture of the citizens' plight after enduring 10 to 12 hours of hardship.
Despite the predicament, local government-affiliated political parties face an uphill battle as they strive to connect with the public for votes amidst the aftermath of the rain. The coming days will reveal the lasting impact of this rain-induced crisis on the city and its political dynamics.
Wall-less nullah annihilates another life

1,PPP faces backlash from rivals,"MQM-P, JI claim recent rains exposed PPP govt’s poor performance","The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), led by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, is facing intense backlash from political opponents as Karachi, the capital of Sindh, witnessed severe traffic jams and multiple power outages during the unprecedented winter rains over the last two days.
Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) Convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui accused the PPP of neglecting Karachi's welfare, asserting that the city was under the rule of 'enemies' after the rain.
Siddiqui criticised the caretaker Sindh government for allegedly prioritising PPP's interests. He pointed out that Mayor Murtaza Wahab, elected after what he referred to as 'sham' elections, received substantial funds from the federal government, but the state of Karachi did not reflect the investment.
Siddiqui further lamented that the rains exposed the PPP government's performance over the past 15 years and highlighted the extensive traffic delays he personally experienced. He claimed that Karachi was crying under the rule of its enemies.
Jamaat-e-Islami's (JI) Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman echoed the sentiment, blaming the mayor's poor performance for the chaos during the rains.
Rehman criticised the lack of arrangements made by the mayor despite prior predictions of rain by the meteorological department. He asserted that the newly constructed roads and sewage systems had been destroyed in the downpour, challenging the PPP's claim of transforming Karachi into Paris before the general elections slated for February 8.
Rehman also highlighted the timely response of Jamaat-e-Islami and Al-Khidmat volunteers in different areas for rescue efforts immediately after the rain. This comes as a counterpoint to the perceived failures of the PPP-led administration in managing the aftermath of the heavy rainfall.
As the criticism intensifies, the PPP finds itself in the midst of a political storm, facing questions about its governance and preparedness for weather-related challenges in one of Pakistan's most populous cities.

2,"No home, no vote: Flood victims far removed from polling process",Displaced affectees with missing CNIC’s will be unable to cast their votes in the upcoming elections,"As parties and patrons remain engrossed in their campaigning drives for the upcoming General Elections 2024, many seem to have forgotten that the multitudes of displaced flood victims spread across the country, with devastated homes and lost identification documents, are also eligible voters.
Abdul Jabbar, a resident of a village located in Larkana had his house completely destroyed during the heavy rainfall and massive flooding in 2022. “Our home has still not been reconstructed, and my family continues to be displaced. Therefore, we cannot cast in our votes in the elections,” shared Jabbar, who was still awaiting the financial assistance announced by the last PPP government.
Similar to Jabbar, Gulab Jamali, another flood victim from the katcha area of Larkana, revealed that all of his family members had lost their CNIC’s during the flooding. “All our belongings including major identification documents were swept away by the flood water,” bemoaned Jamali, who could not obtain a new CNIC since the NADRA center was located far away from his village.
“Almost 10 to 15 percent of the flood affected population will be unable to cast their votes in the forthcoming elections since they do not possess their CNICs, which were misplaced during the floods,” validated Rehmatullah Buriro, an analyst and social worker based in Sukkur.
According to a recent survey conducted by the Center for Peace and Development Initiatives, in the aftermath of the 2022 floods in Khairpur and Naushahro Feroze, which witnessed the displacement of 1,500,000 people and the destruction of over 400,000 houses and a road network spanning 1349 kilometers, many flood affected families have still not been able to return to their native areas, where their votes are registered.
Since polling stations are usually set up in government schools and at least 40 percent of the government school buildings in Sindh have been damaged as a result of the floods, it is evident that the polling process will be downsized in flood affected areas. Even though, the current caretaker government has released funds worth Rs3.3 billion last December to repair the buildings of 9901 schools in the province, the state of the road network is such that it will be difficult for the voters of the affected areas to reach the polling stations on time.
Naseer Memon, a renowned columnist and social activist, after a recent visit to the flood affected areas, confirmed that it will be difficult for the voters to access the polling stations due to the destruction of the road network.
“A large number of people have still not been able to recover from the catastrophe even after the passage of 18 months. Many families are still displaced from their homes. The damaged road network in the affected areas is yet to be restored. The effects of this situation will be seen in the upcoming elections on February 8th,” seconded Riaz Sohail, a senior journalist, while speaking to The Express Tribune.

3,TLP urges youth to be part of political process,Rizvi says oppressive forces will resurge if people fail to exercise their democratic right,"Thousands of people from diverse sectors of the society actively participated in the election gathering organised by the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) Karachi Division.
Notable figures, including scholars, businessmen, members of the legal community, as well as TLP nominees and party leaders in Karachi, addressed the gathering.
TLP Chief Saad Hussain Rizvi asserted that several political parties, including PML-N, PPP, and MQM, are strategically aligning in mutual support. He voiced concerns about the apparent collusion, stating that while the match may seem fixed, TLP is steadfast in preventing any pre-election manipulations.
Saad Rizvi urged the youth of Karachi to rise and actively contribute to the political process. He emphasized the critical role of citizens casting their votes on February 8, highlighting the potential resurgence of oppressive forces if they fail to exercise their democratic right.
Saad Rizvi criticized past political tactics that exploited Karachi’s residents in the name of ethnicity and questioned the efficacy of parties that have been in power for three decades without improving the city’s conditions.
Addressing the audience, Saad Rizvi urged Karachi’s residents to place their trust in TLP, emphasizing a shared Muslim identity over linguistic affiliations. He raised concerns about international agreements, specifically those with the IMF, questioning their lack of transparency and public disclosure. Saad Rizvi criticized the practice of taking loans for the rulers’ luxury, burdening the public with increased taxes. He advocated for the implementation of Nizam-e-Mustafa, asserting that TLP aims to establish a corruption-free and interest-free system, propelling Pakistan towards development.
Expressing gratitude, the TLP chief thanked the people of Karachi for their active participation, making the rally a resounding success.

7,CM irked over PDMA performance,Takes strong exception to failure of authorities to help people during rain emergency,"Caretaker Chief Minister Justice (retd) Maqbool Baqar during a rain emergency meeting at CM House decided to issue displeasure letters to the Deputy Inspector General of Police and Director General of Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) for failing to respond in time. As a result, the public suffered losses.
CM Baqar, as the incumbent chief executive of the province, has put all the civic agencies and local bodies, PDMA, traffic police, and the water and sewerage corporation on high alert to deal with heavy rains.

PTI supporters have established election offices for their candidates, displaying banners and conducting wall chalking to garner support. Overnight, a plethora of PTI candidate banners has emerged on central highways, intersections, roads, and neighbourhoods of Latifabad, featuring election symbols and utilizing the signature red and green colours of the PTI flag. Additionally, PTI workers are actively distributing pamphlets and small-sized sticky posters to promote their candidates.
Interestingly, the banners put up by PTI do not explicitly mention Imran Khan's name but prominently display the PTI acronym, adopting the party's distinct red and green colour scheme.
Conversely, the PTI Hyderabad spokesperson has raised concerns about the continued harassment of their candidates by individuals in uniform and plain clothes. Allegedly, on Friday night, individuals in black uniforms attempted to forcefully enter the residence of National Assembly candidate Dr. Mustansar Billah in the Kohsar area. The intruders surrounded the house, beat on the main gate, and damaged CCTV cameras by cutting their wires. Despite no reaction from the occupants, the intruders eventually left.

9,Pakistan Markazi Muslim League coverts election offices to relief centres,PMML workers responded to the call to help people in distress as a religious obligation,"Heavy rainfall in Karachi has exposed the inefficiencies of the administration and municipal authorities, said Pakistan Markazi Muslim League President Ahmed Nadeem Awan.
Speaking at the rescue operation site, Awan said PMML has converted its election offices into rescue centres in the city. Workers of the PMML rescued citizens stranded in floodwaters at various locations in the city.
On self-help basis, PMML workers responded to the call to help people in distress as a religious obligation and a service in the way of Allah Almighty. They pushed stranded vehicles out of flooded roads, and helped people reach safe places. Moreover, mechanics in PMML fold braved cold and wet weather to start stranded vehicles free of cost, a service which may cost thousands of rupees in emergency situations.

Along with extracting submerged vehicles, the blocked water supply lines were also opened. The process of pumping out the accumulated water through suction pumps is ongoing. Inhabitants of low-lying areas were also provided with cooked meals during the rescue operation.
Awan stated that the authorities are engaged in a power struggle, and Karachi is sinking. Besides a limited area, the administration failed to take any noteworthy action. Mayor Karachi should know that Karachi is inundated not only on Shahra-e-Faisal but also in other areas.
The party that has held control over Sindh for the past 15 years remains unable to provide a proper drainage system to the people of Karachi. Those asking for votes from the public with the threat of drowning Karachi should be questioned. Now is the time for the public to reject the incompetent ones and use the power of their vote for a cleansing of the incapable.
