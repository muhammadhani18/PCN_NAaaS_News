0,Seven keys to good tax policy,"PML-N, PPP fail to articulate business, people-friendly tax policy in manifestos","In “A Template for Understanding the Economy”, Arthur Laffer cautions rightly that “Next to a bad money, I know of nothing that will bring an economy to its knees faster than an unjust, inefficient, anti-growth, excessive system of taxation. This principle is universal.”
I add its corollary here: Pakistan’s tax system is unjust, inefficient, anti-growth and excessive. Pakistan’s economy has been brought to heels.
Echoing the same principle, PIDE Reform Manifesto concludes that “the (Pakistan) tax regime is highly complicated and primarily revolves around meeting tax-to-GDP targets, often sidelining fundamental principles like fairness, certainty, efficiency, and convenience.”
It is disappointing to see that both PML-N and PPP, which are leading contenders for the government in Islamabad, have failed to articulate a business and people-friendly tax policy in their manifestos. The Jamaat-e-Islami, on other hand, has made a clear commitment to reduce tax rates and increase the tax base, while withdrawing tax exemptions available to the elite.
PPP’s New Peoples Economy Plan is slightly better on one account: fairness. It promises to eradicate untargeted subsidies and tax expenditures and reduce reliance on exemptions to broaden the tax base and achieve a fairer system.
It also accords right emphasis on leveraging provincial and local taxation and harmonisation of general sales tax.
Similarly, one good thing in PML-N tax-related manifesto is that it has promised to keep tax regime unchanged for five years for stability. Hopefully, this does not mean maintaining the current tax regime!
Without clarity on tax policy, reforms and mechanism, no economic reform can work. Ambiguity also results in ad hoc measures which only aim to increase tax revenue or tax exemptions for selected sectors which distort competition.
Both PPP and PML-N have promised to increase tax-to-GDP ratio, a misguided target which has achieved the status of gospel, thanks to bad economics we teach and poor advice we receive.
Read: Revenue shortfall to be met with more taxes
We need to break down this consensus. For this, we need a tax policy, and here is a framework.
In his book, Laffer attributes the following text to Rizwan Rawji, as “Seven Keys to a Good Tax Policy”. It is worth to share these pillars:
i – Tax these items most that can escape the least, and conversely tax those least that can easily escape. It makes no sense to tax something that then flees the jurisdiction, goes underground, or stops working. You not only don’t get the revenue, but you also lose the benefits of productive services.
ii – Tax those things most that you least like (sin taxes). An additional benefit or sin tax is that they do reduce the activity being taxed.
iii – Tax those things least where the collection costs are highest.
iv – Broad-based, low-rate taxes provide people with the least incentives to evade, avoid and otherwise not report taxable income and the least number of places where they can escape taxation.
v – Tax people fairly. People in like circumstances should have similar tax burdens. The perception of fairness is the key to voluntary compliance.
vi – Make sure that taxation is not arbitrary or easily subject to discretionary changes. The power to tax in the wrong hand is an ugly weapon for exploitation.
vii – Lastly, collect only as much as you really need. Wasteful spending will always rise to the level of revenues.
We believe that these principles can offer starting point to develop a tax policy, which will be just, efficient, and pro-growth. These principles can lead to a new tax policy, which has been outlined already by writers Ikramul Haq and Huzaima Bukhari in their publication “Towards Flat, low-rate, broad and predictable taxes” by PRIME, which presents a roadmap towards tax reform.
There is an urgent need for Pakistani institutions, taxpayers, think tanks, and academics to sit down and develop consensus on tax reforms soon after the new government assumes office. While political dynamics will take their own turn, we should all strive together to debate and agree on these points.
If we can sign on a “Fair Tax Charter”, it can produce decent pressure on the new government to agree on this charter before it goes into the exercise of its first annual budget.
Tinkering and incrementalism will not work. We need a Milei effect in Islamabad.

1,Can Pakistan capitalise on the EV boom?,"Inviting Chinese manufacturers, nurturing local EV ecosystem can position Pakistan on global map","In 2011, Elon Musk, Co-Founder, and CEO of Tesla, laughed at the prospects of China’s BYD effectively competing with his company in the electric vehicle (EV) market. Now, BYD has surpassed Tesla, becoming the leading seller of battery-only vehicles. In the final quarter of 2023, BYD sold 41,500 more cars than its American rival. This reflects the major shifts occurring in the global EV industry, highlighting the need for Pakistani policymakers to recognise and leverage these trends for economic advantage.
Pakistan has long faced financial challenges, notably a significant trade imbalance that burdens its economy. In the second half of 2023, Pakistan’s imports of goods exceeded exports by $11.3 billion, data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics show. A substantial portion of this trade deficit stems from the costly imports of energy products, including crude oil, liquid fuels like petrol and diesel, LPG, and LNG.
Pakistan’s limited domestic crude oil production meets only 15% of its demand and leads to heavy reliance on imports. Rising population and urbanisation are increasing energy needs, particularly in the transportation sector. However, the shift towards EVs could mitigate some of the energy import requirements, besides offering notable environmental benefits.
The global EV market has surged in the last three years, with the US, China, South Korea, Japan, and European nations experiencing rapid growth. BloombergNEF projects a 21% increase in EV sales in 2024 to 16.7 million units, with EVs representing one-fifth of all cars sold this year. However, Pakistan has yet to contribute to this boom. High-end EVs from Tesla or BYD remain out of reach for most Pakistanis, with limited availability due to no official presence and steep prices.
Despite this, the evolving landscape of the EV market could favour Pakistan. Although EV sales in the developed world are growing, they’re not as strong as initially anticipated, which could be due to potential market saturation and consumer hesitancy amid tough economic conditions. With increased competition and price cuts from giants like Tesla and BYD to boost sales, EVs may become more accessible worldwide. This shift offers Pakistan an opportunity to bring affordable EVs into its market.
Read: Tesla plans to build new electric vehicles in mid-2025
Pakistan, positioned right next to China—the epicentre of the world’s EV market forecasted to represent 60% of global EV sales in 2024—has a strategic opportunity to dive into the EV boom. China’s burgeoning EV scene is getting crowded with both traditional automakers like GAC Motor and new entrants like the tech giants Huawei and Xiaomi, which are launching their own EV models. Amid intensifying competition, many Chinese companies, including BYD, are eyeing global expansion, offering Pakistan an opportunity to draw in these EV pioneers.
Note that the Government of Pakistan’s National Electric Vehicle Policy, launched in 2019, set ambitious targets: by 2030, EVs should make up 30% of new car and heavy truck sales, and 50% of sales for two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and buses. However, progress towards these goals has been sluggish, with EVs barely making their mark in overall vehicle sales.
A handful of Pakistani companies have ventured into the EV space, hinting at potential demand, especially in the two and three-wheeler segments. Yet, the government’s actions have fallen short of the policy’s aspirations. None of the major Chinese EV makers are present in the country, and local investors have been hesitant to fully commit without clear, supportive measures from the government.
To accelerate growth, Pakistan should offer better, long-term-oriented incentives that include tax breaks for investors, affordable financing options for EV buyers, and subsidies for manufacturers to establish assembly and production facilities locally, alongside developing the requisite charging infrastructure. The government must also work with the private sector to establish vocational training centres to cultivate a skilled workforce that is crucial for the local EV industry’s development.
By inviting Chinese EV manufacturers to Pakistan and nurturing a local EV ecosystem, policymakers can position Pakistan on the global map of sustainable mobility.
To decisively slash Pakistan’s energy imports, the government must adopt a comprehensive strategy that goes beyond the EV space. It’s imperative to boost local refinery operations as well to their utmost potential, aiming for a utilisation rate above 90% from the current near 60%. Such an enhancement in refinery productivity would increase the volume of domestically produced fuels, cutting reliance on expensive imported petrol and diesel.
Moreover, revitalising the faltering oil and gas exploration and production sector is crucial. This sector has been marred by dwindling foreign investment and a steady decline in production. Equally important is the push towards renewable energy initiatives, aiming for a transition from fossil fuels to cleaner, sustainable sources for electricity generation. These steps represent a holistic commitment to redefining Pakistan’s energy narrative.
In short, the government must not only look inward but also outward, aligning with global trends to catalyse economic growth.
Such a holistic strategy requires more than just policy tweaks—it demands a bold commitment to innovation and a willingness to forge new paths in the face of traditional challenges. The pivotal question then arises: Do our policymakers possess the courage to embark on such transformative initiatives?

2,Complex supply chain of cyber warfare,Digital arms producers are now considered mainstream defence contractors in 2024,"At the 37th Chaos Communication Congress (37C3) held in December 2023, a team of researchers unveiled Operation Triangulation – a new Pegasus-styled iPhone attack that exploits over thirty previously unknown vulnerabilities affecting all devices not upgraded to the latest iOS 17 version. From using Galileo RCS for government interception to attacking power plants, digital arms producers are now considered mainstream defence contractors in 2024. Cyber products, such as Cobalt Strike, used by threat actors to generate malicious payloads, are regulated by US export control regulations and require licenses for export to more than 40 countries. Hacking is no longer an endeavour involving a single individual or team; instead, it has evolved into a complex supply chain with different suppliers specialising in their niches.
There are primarily three types of covert cyber weapons used in high-precision surgical attacks: malware (implants), listening posts, and C2 (command & control) systems. Additionally, there are DoS (denial of service), DDoS (Distributed DoS), and botnets that use a network of computers to flood a public service. However, all types of weapons have an integrated supply chain.
Similar to the C3 conference that exposed vulnerabilities in the public domain, the cyber supply chain begins with a fully-fledged market for discovering vulnerabilities in commonly used software on PCs and mobiles. While some cybersecurity companies, such as runZero, Inc., publish vulnerabilities and exploits for public awareness, there exists a vast grey market for zero-days or undisclosed exploits. Companies like Zerodium (formerly Vupen) sell unpublished exploits to government agencies and offer substantial bounties to individuals reporting exclusive exploits related to web browsers, iOS, and Android. Some companies act as retailers of zero-days, while many have extensive research staff and are original producers of new exploits. It is noteworthy that the US government doesn’t crack down on zero-day grey markets, given that agencies like the National Security Agency (NSA) stockpile zero-day vulnerabilities and payloads for exploitation.
Read: ‘Cybersecurity requires global cooperation’
Two types of markets then emerge from these zero-day vulnerabilities: one for security products such as firewalls, IDS, NDR, EDR, and antiviruses that incorporate defences against newly known exploits, often leading to the release of patches from respective vendors. Many antivirus companies retrain their AI-based behavioural models on payloads based on newly known exploits, with the expectation of countering other variants of such attacks.
Similarly, there is a market for cyber weapons benefiting from both the white and grey markets of zero-days, although the time window to weaponise already published exploits in the public domain is relatively small. Corporations like Memento Labs offer tools for monitoring communication mediums and targeted surveillance of political figures on behalf of government agencies. Simultaneously, corporations like Cambridge Analytica and YouGov have exploited social media for managing public opinion in line with hybrid warfare.
Then, there is a black market for code generators that use current exploits to auto-generate trojans, viruses, and other “weaponised” malware. North Korean and Russian hackers weaponise these exploits to attack large organisations, stealing and encrypting data with demands for payments in crypto as a ransom. In 2023, the average ransom payment is now touching the $1.5 million mark and has become a menace for administrators of government, educational, and commercial establishments. For example, the Moscow-based Medusa group (with proxy servers in the Netherlands) hit numerous universities last year and released sensitive data related to student psychological, financial, and other assessment reports on the dark web.
Unfortunately, unlike nuclear and missile programmes, cyber weapons pose a serious proliferation risk as they are challenging to regulate and retain, and even employees who developed them can easily exfiltrate copies of software without leaving any trace. Government hackers who acquire such weapons often sell their services in black markets, as they are willing to pay millions for weapons based on undisclosed zero-days. In a nutshell, gone are the days when hacking was a sport for some rogue teenager or tech geek – it has now evolved into a complete ecosystem and, particularly, a lethal one.

3,Trade strategies to turn a new leaf,New govt should come out with all guns blazing to tackle challenges,"As Pakistan enters into a new political era with the upcoming elections, the new government will need to come out with all guns blazing to tackle the surmounting economic challenges.
Pakistan has been in the grip of an economic slowdown as political uncertainty has reduced business and investor confidence in the country. The recent monetary policy statement, published by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), highlights the slowdown in the decline in inflation as sizeable adjustments in energy prices have been made in recent months.
The fuel price hike in early February continues to pose challenges as domestic energy prices keep on rising.
Although the statement does note the improvement in foreign exchange reserves of the central bank and the current account surplus reported for December, it also suggests that recent tensions in the Red Sea and the Middle East and the rise in global freight rates may create challenges for Pakistan.
At a time when high inflation is a major concern, the adverse impact on the cost and flow of global trade will add further complexities for the policymakers. The central bank has continued with its tight monetary policy but also expects that its consolidation will help achieve the inflation target of 5-7%.
The new government will have a mountain to climb as it tackles the economic challenges and reduces inflation to the target set by the central bank. A right mix of trade strategies will become ever more crucial.
The balance of payments crisis, which is often exacerbated with the indecision of the government to approach multilateral and bilateral creditors for financial assistance, aggravated the economic conditions.
Import restrictions imposed to curtail the trade deficit led to shortages, raising prices and reducing the level of production in the country, particularly of goods that are heavily dependent on imported inputs.
Although the trade deficit decreased by 43% in FY23 over the value reported in FY22 and by 39% year-on-year in the first seven months of FY24, it did not necessarily alleviate the economic challenges the country was facing. Imports declined by 31% in the same time period, while exports decreased by 13%.
Exports had surpassed $31 billion in FY22 but decreased to $28 billion in FY23. Workers’ remittances also declined in a similar fashion, reducing from $31 billion to $27 billion.
The current account deficit was curtailed due to the reduction in imports, which decreased by approximately $20 billion in the same period.
Furthermore, the government was able to get loans rolled over from both China and the UAE recently, providing some respite as the central bank accumulates the much-needed foreign exchange reserves.
Policymakers will have to reconsider import-related restrictions to revive growth and reduce the rate of inflation. Policies that enhance the development and sustainability of trade networks, both regionally and globally, will be crucial if the economy must turn a new leaf.
Read: Trade deficit shrinks to $13.1b
First, it is essential to ensure that trading relationships are not only reestablished but also expanded. Improved trading relationships across borders will allow firms to not only procure their inputs from the more efficient sources, regionally and globally, but increase consumer welfare through lower prices and increased variety.
Negotiations with the IMF for a future package must include strategies to avoid restrictions on imports.
Second, it is essential for the government to pursue measures to improve trade and customs infrastructure. Electronic Single Window and paperless cross-border trade procedures and processes that reduce the cost and time to trade are essential.
The Pakistan Single Window is an excellent resource to boost the capabilities of trade-related infrastructure and ensure maximum participation of businesses in international trading activities.
Digitalisation processes should also ensure better access to information for smaller businesses that often face barriers due to information asymmetries, which lock them out of potential export markets.
Lowering the cost of shipping and transportation through a more efficient domestic infrastructure, both physical and digital, will become increasingly important if the Middle Eastern crisis prolongs and creates blockades in transportation.
Third, it is imperative to ensure that domestic production and processes meet international standards, particularly those set by our major export market destinations.
For instance, the EU is likely to impose carbon taxes on exports in certain industries in the near future, while several major trading partners are imposing higher quality standards, certification requirements, conformity assessments and product quality testing requirements that could potentially create challenges for the non-compliant exporters.
The government must also push for adopting greener technologies as it not only reduces reliance on imported fossil fuels but also encourages exporters to avail of incentives offered by export destination markets related to using green technology in their production procedures and processes.
Lastly, it is imperative for the policymakers to realise that the balance of payments crisis is due to the lack of productivity and capabilities of our producers. The trade deficit is a symptom of inefficiencies in the economy and restricting imports may only temporarily solve the balance of payments crisis.
It is unlikely to cure the disease, which is caused by low productivity levels and poor capabilities. Hence, the government must instead focus on improving the productivity levels of businesses and providing opportunities to boost their capabilities.
In essence, the new government will need to undertake several measures to improve the economic conditions. Trade strategies must evolve in order to tackle the surmounting challenges.

4,Developing an Islamic finance benchmark,Supporters call for more customised benchmark aligning with unique requirements and values,"With the global Islamic financial sector approaching close to $4 trillion in assets and having surpassed the Rs8 trillion assets milestone in Pakistan, a common question in Islamic finance revolves around the use of conventional benchmarks like Kibor or Libor when pricing an Islamic finance transaction or Sukuk. Considered one of the common myths is the belief that using a conventional benchmark rate to calculate rental for an asset or to determine the profit amount in a credit sale of goods in an Islamic financing contract makes the transaction impermissible.
This question gains significance in the context of the ongoing conversion in Pakistan’s banking sector. In light of the Federal Shariat court’s decision, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) aims to transition from an interest-based banking system to a more just and ethical Islamic banking system by the end of 2027. Additionally, concerns arise about what Islamic financial institutions will do when conventional benchmarks cease to exist after the conversion of the financial system in Pakistan. There is a strong desire among supporters of Islamic finance for the pricing mechanism to move away from benchmarks rooted in conventional banking, advocating for a more customised benchmark for Islamic finance that aligns with its unique requirements and values. Regulators also support the development of benchmarks that reflect the economy, create a positive economic impact, and are less prone to market manipulation, as seen in the case of Libor.
To understand the answers to these questions, we need to examine the issue in three dimensions: Shariah compliance, customer perception, and market competition.
From a Shariah compliance perspective, the majority of Shariah scholars, jurists, and Shariah standards issued by The Accounting and Auditing Organiaation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) Bahrain allow the use of conventional benchmark rates for pricing an Islamic transaction, provided that the transaction follows all the requirements of Islamic rules of contract. These rates are considered a measure or a number to calculate the return of a permissible transaction. Scholars clarify that the permissibility depends on the mode of finance, process, and steps followed. If all the required steps of a valid transaction are followed, it cannot be considered impermissible merely because the profit earned in the Islamic deal is similar to the interest earned in a loan transaction.
For instance, providing an interest-based loan at 10% to a customer is not permissible. However, earning a profit of 10% in a valid sale of raw material to a factory is allowed. Even if someone uses the Islamic rate of Zakat at 2.5% or the rate of Ushr at 10% to provide an interest-based loan, that act would remain impermissible as per Islamic rules.
Read: BankIslami calls for more Islamic banking
In addition, scholars strongly advise Islamic financial institutions that, while the use of conventional benchmarks is permissible, it is not preferable in Islamic finance to determine profit using conventional banking rates and benchmarks. They recommend exploring options for developing benchmarks based on Islamic banking markets or linked to some real economic parameter, aligning with the objectives of Shariah. In 2011, Thomson Reuters introduced the Islamic Interbank Benchmark Rate (IIBR) as a potential solution, addressing concerns related to interest-based benchmarks. The methodology involves contributions from a panel of Islamic banks, ensuring Shariah-compliant funding costs are reflected.
Secondly, customer perception related to the use of benchmarks is crucial. From a behavioural economics point of view, understanding the perception created by the use of an interest-based benchmark is essential. Many customers perceive it negatively when Islamic banks use conventional benchmarks, creating a hurdle in spreading the share of Islamic finance. Introducing a new benchmark is not just about rules; it could remove confusion for the common man and create a positive image for industry growth. A separate benchmark can enhance trust among stakeholders and help differentiate Islamic financial products. The SBP has acknowledged the need for a separate benchmark for the Islamic banking industry to boost public confidence.
The third dimension of the Islamic benchmark is market dynamics and competition. It will be interesting to observe how much the Islamic benchmark will differ from conventional benchmarks. The difference will depend on market dynamics, calculation methodology, and underlying factors such as linking to economic factors, market share of Islamic banks, and the activity of the Islamic inter-bank market. In markets allowing both conventional and Islamic banking, benchmarks may be closer, while in markets exclusively permitting Islamic banking, the benchmark may evolve differently.
Based on the above deliberations, developing an Islamic pricing benchmark merits serious efforts. For successful development and wider acceptability of such a benchmark, stakeholders need to ensure Sharia compliance, industry collaboration, transparent underlying methodology, wider dissemination, and close monitoring within the Islamic finance community. As the industry progresses, it is the right time for policymakers, regulators, industry players, and academics to sit together with the guidance of Shariah scholars to explore working models for Islamic pricing benchmarks. The development of an Islamic benchmark will not only foster confidence and trust in customers but also fuel the growth of Islamic finance in Pakistan.
