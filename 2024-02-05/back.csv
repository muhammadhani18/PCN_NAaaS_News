1,ECP asks govt to stop PIA privatisation,Requested the federal government not to enter into any kind of agreement related to the PIA privatisation,"The Election Commission of Pakistan has asked the caretaker provincial government to stop the privatisation process of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) in view of the upcoming general elections on Thursday, next week.
The ECP also requested the federal government not to enter into any kind of agreement related to the PIA privatisation, seeking the plan documents prepared by the federal cabinet for the privatisation of the PIA.

Last week, Privatisation Minister Fawad Hasan Fawad said the interim government was making “binding plans” for the incoming government after the Feb 8 elections to privatise the loss-making PIA.
In the past, elected governments shied away from undertaking unpopular reforms, including the sale of the national-flag carrier. However, in June, the then coalition government led by the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz President Shehbaz Sharif agreed to overhaul the loss-making state-owned enterprises under a deal with the International Monetary Fund.

2,Zardari vows to change Talagang’s fortunes,"At polls rally, PPP leader pledges to develop its infrastructure","PPP co-chairperson and former president Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday pledged to bring prosperity to Talagang by developing its infrastructure and giving its farmers their due income for their crops if its people voted for his party.
""These rulers do not want to give the due prices of your crops,” Zardari said while addressing an election rally held in connection with its candidate for NA-59 Talagang-cum-Chakwal, Malik Hassan Sardar.
He added that the district’s people would not have to leave the country to earn money after the district’s farmers received their fair share of income from their crops.
Talagang district was carved out of Chakwal in 2022. As it could not independently qualify for a National Assembly seat, it shared one with Chakwal.
He told the rally that he had arrived in Talagang because of the love with which he was invited there by its people.
“I will never forget the love and affection shown to me by the people of Talagang in these two days.”
Zardari underscored the PPP government's achievements, particularly the initiation of the Benazir Income Support Programme and the doubling of government employees' salaries.
However, he acknowledged the current challenges faced by the people, citing high inflation that outpaces salary increments.

The former president maintained that the PPP, being a representative party of labourers and farmers, understood the problems faced by the poor.
He promised to launch development projects in Talagang aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions, infrastructure and overall well-being of the backward region, including the provision of gas as well as clean drinking water once a PPP government was established.
Zardari highlighted the PPP’s commitment to the progress of the underdeveloped region by promising to appoint administrative officers who were aware of the challenges faced by the residents.
He said that he would take all the people of the country forward together.
“The PPP has always talked about improving the condition of the common man.”
The former president told the partcipnats of the rally that the PPP in its current election manifesto had kept a rich package for workers, labourers, farmers and the poor.
The PPP co-chairperson started his speech by chanting the “Jeay Bhutto” slogan.
As soon as Zardari reached the stage, the participants of the rally welcomed him with applause.

3,ECP begins ballot paper delivery,260 million ballot papers printed despite various challenges,"The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has commenced the delivery of 260 million ballot papers across 859 National Assembly and provincial assembly constituencies nationwide as the general election nears, stated a spokesperson for the oversight body on Sunday.
Printing was finalized at three government presses, with some papers necessitating reprinting following court decisions on candidacy-related petitions.
This election cycle marks a substantial increase from 2018, with 2,170 tons of paper utilized for the printing process. The heightened number of printed ballot papers, totaling 260 million for the February 8 vote, reflects a 40 million increase from the previous election, indicative of the scale and significance of the upcoming electoral process.
“Despite limited time and challenges, the ECP fulfilled its responsibility, by completing the printing of ballot papers on time,” the spokesperson said. “The process of delivery of ballot papers has started all over the country and it will be completed by tomorrow (today),” the spokesperson added.

4,"Siraj points gun at PML-N, PPP",JI chief likens their current verbal duel to scripted wrestling,"Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) chief Sirajul Haq has urged people to bury the politics of traditional parties—the PML-N and the PPP—forever in the upcoming general elections, vowing to struggle for the freedom of Kashmiris, Palestinians, and Dr Aafia Siddiqui if his party is elected to power.
""On February 8th, vote for Tarazu—the JI’s election symbol—if you want education and employment for your children, a corruption-free Pakistan, and an interest-free financial system,"" Haq said during an election rally on Sunday at Rawalpindi’s historic Liaqat Bagh.
During the speech, the JI chief criticized both the PML-N and the PPP for their alleged failure to deliver significant progress to the people despite ruling the country multiple times.
According to Haq, the PML-N leaders—Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif—always keep praising each other whenever it comes to presenting their past performance, while PPP Chairman Bilalwal Bhutto Zardari tells people that he should now be elected as the prime minister as both his mother and grandfather have already served as the country’s PMs.
Referring to the ongoing verbal duel between the former ruling parties ahead of the general elections, the JI chief claimed that this apparent confrontation was staged for public consumption, likening it to scripted wrestling.
He said, ""February 8 will bring an end to corruption; it will bring an end to ignorance, poverty, and lawlessness.""
Haq noted that after Makkah and Medina, Pakistan is the most sacred state in the world. ""Pakistan possesses all resources, including gold, silver, and fertile land. Pakistan is abundant with talented youth, so why are we in such a miserable state?"" he asked.

He noted that both the PPP and the PML-N had ruled the country four times each but failed to deliver.
""If they could not deliver in the last 35 years, then how could they deliver anything now? The president, prime minister, and establishment were with them. What have they done? They have given the country inflation, unemployment, and lawlessness.
""It is because of the PPP and the PML-N that the country is burdened with trillions of rupees in debt. The people do not have access to clean water, they do not receive justice, and there is no education system for the poor. And then they say, 'One more chance',"" he added.
He said the economic policy of these parties is to borrow loans and spend them. Voting for the PPP and PML-N, he said, means voting for the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
""Every year, Rs5,000 billion is lost due to corruption. However, if they are elected to power this time, corruption will increase to Rs10,000 billion per year,"" he claimed.
The JI chief reminded the people that it was during the rule of Nawaz Sharif that Pakistan handed over Aimal Kansi to America and executed Mumtaz Hussain Qadri.
Kansi was a Pakistani national who was convicted of the 1993 shootings at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and subsequently executed in the US in November 2002.
Qadri was a police constable who assassinated Punjab former governor Salman Taseer in January 2011 after the latter publicly supported a blasphemy accused Aasia Masih.

5,In 135 constituencies ECP fails to ensure less than 10% population variation,"FAFEN says varying voter-to-population ratios among NA, PA constituencies weakens equal suffrage","The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) failed to meet the legal requirement of keeping the variation in population to less than 10 per cent in a total of 135 constituencies – 70 National Assembly and 65 provincial assembly seats, it emerged on Sunday.
Shocking as it may seem, voters in these 135 constituencies would be electing a member of the National Assembly each but the difference between the highest and lowest number of registered voters in some constituencies is so huge that, in one case, one constituency equals to almost five.
For instance, NA-67 Hafizabad has the highest number of registered voters – 810,723 – while NA-244 Karachi West-I has the lowest number of registered voters 155,824; showing that varying voter-to-population ratios among NA, PA constituencies weakens the equal suffrage.
The disparity has been detected by the Free & Fair Elections Network (Fafen) in its report pertaining to delimitation of constituencies. It was released on Sunday, just four days before the country is all set to go to the Feb 8 general elections.
“Equality of population among the constituencies in an assembly also needs to be adhered to in the spirit of Section 20 (3) of the Elections Act 2017 (Principles of Delimitation), which restricts the population variation to 10 per cent,” Fafen said.
Notwithstanding Rule 10(5) of the Elections Act, 2017 that enables the ECP to restrict the population variation among the constituencies in a district, Fafen holds the population variation must be seen on the basis of the constituencies in an assembly as specifically provided in the law.
On that basis, it said, at least “70 NA and 65 PA constituencies did not comply with the legal requirement of Section 20 (3) of the Elections Act 2017”.
It said that Punjab has the highest number of National Assembly constituencies (28) with a variation in population of more than 10 per cent, followed by 21 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 18 in Sindh, and three in Balochistan.
Of the 65 provincial assembly constituencies that did not fulfil the legal requirement, it reads, 20 are in K-P, 18 in Punjab, 16 in Balochistan and 11 in Sindh.
In K-P, the report reveals, NA-18 Haripur has the highest number of registered voters (724,915), while NA-12 Kohistan Upper-cum-Kohistan Lower-cum-Kolai Pallas Kohistan has the lowest (196,125).
In Sindh, NA-209 Sanghar-I has the highest number of registered voters (607,638), whereas NA-244 Karachi West-I has the lowest number of registered voters (155,824).
In Balochistan, NA-255 Sohbatpur-cum-Jaffarabad-cum-Usta Mohammad-cum-Nasirabad has the highest number of registered voters (532,537), while NA-264 Quetta-III has the lowest number of registered voters (196,752).

In Punjab, NA-67 Hafizabad has the highest number of registered voters (810,723), while NA-124 Lahore-VIII has the lowest number of registered voters (310,116). Among the three NA constituencies in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), NA-47 ICT-II has the highest number of registered voters, with 433,202, while its neighbouring constituency, NA-48 ICT-III, has the lowest 292,380 voters.
Examining the provincial assembly constituencies also reveals similar trends.
In Punjab, it reads, PP-7 Rawalpindi-I has the highest number of registered voters (386,073), while PP-11 Rawalpindi has the lowest number of registered voters (125,852).
In Sindh, PS-110 Karachi South-V has the highest number of registered voters (315,655), whereas PS-116 Karachi West-I has the lowest number of registered voters (43,045).
In K-P, PK-93 Hangu has the highest number of registered voters (325,951), while PK-33 Kolai Palas Kohistan has the lowest number of registered voters (43,481).
In Balochistan, PB-51 Chaman has the highest number of registered voters (194,081), and PB-45 Quetta-VIII has the lowest number of registered voters (50,160).
The voter-to-population ratio across different regions and constituencies also exhibits a diverse pattern.
Punjab leads in voter registration, with 57 per cent of its total population registered as voters, while Balochistan has the lowest voter registration, with only 36 per cent of its total population registered.
K-P shows a 53 per cent voter registration rate, Sindh follows closely with 48.5 per cent voter registration, and Islamabad records a voter registration rate of 45.8 per cent.
Of the 216 NA constituencies with available population statistics, 45 constituencies have over 60 per cent of their population registered as voters.
Additionally, 114 constituencies fall within the range of 51 to 60 per cent of their population being registered as voters, while 52 constituencies have voter registration rates between 30 and 50 per cent.
Notably, five constituencies, including one in K-P and two each in Sindh and Balochistan, have less than 30 per cent of their population registered as voters.
Across NA constituencies, NA-51 Rawalpindi-cum-Murree has 84.3 per cent of the constituency’s population registered as voters, which is the highest across Pakistan.
Conversely, NA-244 West-I has only 16.5 per cent voter-to-population ratio.
In K-P, NA-16 Abbottabad-I has 79.3 per cent population registered as voters, while NA-12 Kohistan Upper-cum-Kohistan Lower-Cum-Kolai Pallas Kohistan has only 18.8 per cent population registered as voters. In Punjab, the registered voters in NA-51 Rawalpindi-cum-Murree are 84.3 per cent of the constituency’s population, while in NA-125 Lahore-IX, the share of registered voters in the constituency’s population is only 37.9 per cent.
In Sindh, NA-241 South-III has 60.7 per cent of population registered as voters, while NA-235 East-I and NA-244 West-I, the share of voters in the population is only 16.6 per cent and 16.5 per cent, respectively.
In Balochistan, the constituencies with the highest and lowest share of registered voters are NA-263 Quetta-II (46.9 per cent) and NA-274 Quetta III (21.6 per cent).
Revealing the reason behind the disparities, Fafen said that multiple factors may contribute to these disparities, including the presence of Afghan, Behari, Bengali, Burmese, etc, populations in specific geographical pockets; internal migration patterns play a role, as individuals may be counted in one geographical area based on their residence for work or other reasons, while their voter registration remains in their native areas; and under-registration plausibly of women.
However, it said, “The ECP may dwell into specific reasons in an effort to ensure the principle of equal suffrage in its true spirit.”
The report has come on the heels of Fafen’s previous report where it found that the number of registered voters constitutes 53.2 per cent of the 241.49 million population.

6,Kashmir Solidarity Day today,"Hurriyyat leaders reiterated unwavering support of people of Pakistan and AJK, for Kashmiris","Kashmir Solidarity Day will be observed on Monday to express whole-hearted support of the Pakistani nation to the just struggle of Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination under the UN resolutions.
The Ministry of Kashmir Affairs said in a statement on Sunday that arrangements had been made to observe the day at home and abroad in a grand manner. A one-minute silence will be observed at 09:30 am to pay homage to the Kashmiri martyrs, it added.
To mark the day, the ministry said, solidarity walks would be organised across the country. In Islamabad, it added, a rally would be held in solidarity with the Kashmiri people on the Constitution Avenue to be led by cabinet members.
The event would be joined by the parliamentarians and people belonging to different walks of life. Posters and billboards would be displayed on important roads, airports, and railway stations to highlight the plight of Kashmiri people.
In connection with the day, debate and declamation contests as well as essay writing competitions will be organised in educational institutions. The media will broadcast special programmes to express solidarity with the oppressed Kashmiris of IIOJK.
In his message on the eve of Kashmir Solidarity Day, Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar said that India’s illegal and unilateral actions of August 5, 2019 were a blatant violation of international law including the UN Charter, 4th Geneva Convention and the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.
“India has since been engaged in efforts to further entrench these illegal measures through a series of steps aimed at altering the demographic structure and political landscape of IIOJK [Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir],” the prime minister said.
He said that the ‘Kashmir Solidarity Day’ was an occasion to pay rich tribute to the sacrifices made by their Kashmiri brothers and sisters during the last 76 years, he added. “Pakistan will continue to extend its unstinted moral, diplomatic and political support for this just cause,” he added.
Meanwhile, Special Assistant to Prime Minister for Human Rights and Women Empowerment Mushaal Hussein Mullick has said that Kashmir Solidarity Day serves as a reminder that the people of Jammu and Kashmir are not alone in their struggle against the Indian illegal occupation.

Addressing a press conference along with senior Hurriyyat leaders Farooq Rehmani, Ghulam Muhammad Safi and Mehmood Ahmad Saghar, the SAPM reiterated the unwavering support of the people of Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), for their Kashmiri brethren in their just struggle.
She described the people of Jammu and Kashmir as a barrier against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attempts to create an Akhand Bharat. She likened the Hindutva regime of India to the Zionist regime of Israel, terming them significant threats to world peace.
She asserted that both Modi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were in a race to committee genocides – with Modi pursuing a brutal genocide in Kashmir and Netanyahu in the Palestine territory of Gaza.
Expressing deep concern over the situation in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), Mullick lamented the Indian government’s ban on representative political parties that voice the aspirations of the people in IIOJK.
She expressed the fear that her husband, Yasin Malik, a prominent figure in IIOJK, might be unfairly targeted and made a scapegoat for Modi’s electoral triumph. She asserted that India was actively altering the demographics of the IIOJK by granting Kashmiri domiciles to non-Kashmiris.
She highlighted the historical stance of the people of IIOJK in boycotting farce elections in the region.
She cautioned that any potential increase in turnout during the upcoming September elections could be attributed to the illegal settlements and the illegal issuance of Kashmiri domiciles to non-Kashmiris.
Mullick expressed concern about the eradication of Muslim heritage under the auspices of the Modi government. She said that the inauguration of the Ram Mandir by Modi at the site where the historic Babri Masjid once stood was seen by the RSS and extremist Hindus as a triumph for Hindutva.
She further said that the RSS had a transnational terror network, actively conducting operations in various countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, the UK and Pakistan. She urged the international community to make concerted efforts to curb the expansion of the RSS terror network.
Mullick mentioned the establishment of the Kashmir Consultative Committee under her leadership, aimed at formulating recommendations on Kashmir issue for the upcoming administration’s consideration.
She also highlighted her collaboration with the Higher Education Commission (HEC) to establish Kashmir cells in universities throughout Pakistan and AJK. She also highlighted the creation of district-level Kashmir committees, designed to raise awareness about the Kashmir issue at the grassroots level.

9,"Pakistan Navy, PMSA save 9 Indians at sea","Professional, timely response by PN, PMSA was highly acknowledged and lauded by salvaged crew of Tug SAS-5","The Pakistan Navy in coordination with the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) saved the lives of nine Indian seamen at sea.
An Ocean Tug SAS-5 registered at St Kitts & Nevis was disabled for last few days near the Indian coast at a position 167 NM South East of Karachi. The tug suffered a failure of its electric generators and had no electrical supply, a Pakistan Navy news release on Monday said.
In early morning of February 4, Pakistan Navy Joint Maritime Information and Coordination Center (JMICC) received a distress signal from the Ocean. The Tug began its voyage from Indian port of Debhol at Maharashtra on February 1 and was heading to Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.
Upon receipt of information, the Pakistan Navy in coordination with HQ PMSA generated response to initiate a search and rescue operation to provide assistance to the stranded Tug. Initially, PN Long Range Maritime Patrol Aircraft was tasked to locate the tug at sea followed by a search and rescue operation by Pakistan Maritime Security Ship (PMSS) KASHMIR which was deployed on routine maritime security operations in the area.
Upon reaching the distressed Tug, PMSS KASHMIR secured the Tug alongside and after three hours of strenuous repair efforts the defect was rectified. Besides technical assistance, medical facilities, fresh water and cooked meals were also provided to the fatigued crew of the Tug. Upon completion of SAR operation, the tug successfully resumed its voyage towards next port of call at Sharjah.
The professional and timely response by PN & PMSA assets was highly acknowledged and lauded by the salvaged crew of the Tug.
