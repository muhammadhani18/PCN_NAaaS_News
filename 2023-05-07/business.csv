0,Debt servicing surges to Rs3.58tr,Costly domestic borrowings account for 87pc of the total in July-March.,"KARACHI: The surging domestic debt servicing has left no option for the cash-strapped government but to borrow more amid higher spending and low revenue collection.
The government paid a whopping Rs3.107 trillion in domestic debt servicing during the first 9 months of the current fiscal year. 
According to the latest report of the Ministry of Finance, the government spent an overall Rs3.582tr for both external and domestic debt servicing during the July-March period of 2022-23.
The volume of domestic debt servicing was 87pc of the overall total debt servicing.
However, the staggering increase in domestic debt has overburdened the government due to very expensive domestic borrowing at a rate of 22pc.

Costly domestic borrowings account for 87pc of the total in July-March

The government spent Rs3.582tr during 9MFY23 compared to Rs2.122tr in the same period of last year showing an increase of 69pc.
However, the increase in domestic debt servicing was obvious since the government has been borrowing at much higher rates from banks compared to the last year.
The rising inflation invited the attention of the IMF and the government was forced to increase interest rates but the inflation did not show any signs of easing and hit an all-time high exceeding 36pc in April.
Last Wednesday, the government raised Rs705bn through auctions of market treasury bills mostly at the rate of 21.99pc. Such a high return has created an attraction for cash particularly when banks are not ready for lending to the private sector.
Bankers said another big reason for the corporate sector to invest in the government papers was extremely poor activity in the property and construction industries. 
At the same time, the overall economy has sharply fallen to grow with an estimated half per cent in FY23 which means cash has limited options to earn profits.
This high-interest rate of 21pc resulted in very high debt servicing. The IMF has once again reportedly asked Pakistan to increase interest rates to counter the ever-increasing inflation. The trade and industry leaders have already rejected the prevailing interest rate as they find it impossible for any business to sustain it.
Budgetmaking is now a tough task for the government facing pressure from IMF to increase the interest rate, reduce expenditure to curtail fiscal deficit, withdraw more subsidies to improve revenue and impose more taxes to collect higher revenues. 
The next budget is considered an election budget and the PDM government is willing to provide some relief to win votes but the IMF is going tough as the country needs another loan agreement for the next fiscal year.

1,Dwindling payouts amid rising corporate earnings,Stockbrokers ask SECP to ensure dividend distribution.,"KARACHI: The corporate sector seems reluctant to dish out dividends even though its earnings are growing regardless of the tough economic conditions.
The thinning of payouts has led to “decreased investment” in the stock market and undermined “investor confidence,” forcing the stockbrokers to seek immediate intervention from the apex regulatory authority.
In a May 5 letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) Chairman Akif Saeed, Pakistan Stockbrokers Association Secretary General Bilal Farooq Zardi said the drying up of dividends has been detrimental to the interest of minority shareholders.
“We request you to intervene and introduce policies/codes mandating companies to pay dividends to their shareholders,” he said, demanding that special guidelines be issued to ensure fair and consistent dividend payments.

Stockbrokers ask SECP to ensure dividend distribution 

Speaking to Dawn on Saturday, Mr Zardi said about half of the major listed companies have been refraining from paying out dividends without stating any reason.
“It’s essential for companies to pay dividends to their shareholders regularly in order to ensure a fair distribution of profits,” he said.
The proposal is in line with the international best practices as many countries require companies listed on their stock exchanges to maintain a certain dividend pay-out ratio, he said. “In some jurisdictions, companies are required to pay a minimum dividend or face penalties. This encourages them to maintain a regular dividend payment schedule to avoid any legal complications,” he said.
In the last calendar year, companies belonging to the KSE-100 index declared cash dividends of Rs404 billion, down 4pc from 2021, according to data compiled by Topline Securities.
This translates into a dividend pay-out ratio of 39pc in 2022 versus 45pc a year ago. In simpler words, blue-chip companies paid Rs39 out of every Rs100 they earned to their stockholders in the shape of dividends in 2022.
In contrast to a year-on-year decrease in the dividend pay out ratio, after-tax earnings of the same firms increased 10pc over the same 12-month period to Rs1.03 trillion.
The lack of enthusiasm for doling out dividends has led to the piling up of cash reserves on the balance sheets of blue-chip companies. One of the favoured uses of this excess liquidity in the eyes of company sponsors is share buybacks, transactions in which the majority owners use distributable profits to purchase shares of their own companies from the open market.
The total number of shares goes down once a company conducts a share buyback for cancellation. As a result, its break-up value and profit per outstanding share go up. However, many analysts oppose the practice on the pretext that the exercise deprives the stock exchange of valuable shares.
Firms that recently announced or completed share buybacks include Maple Leaf Cement Factory Ltd, NetSol Technologies Ltd, JDW Sugar Mills Ltd, Bank Alfalah Ltd, Lucky Cement Ltd, Engro Corporation Ltd, Synthetic Products Enterprises Ltd, Kohat Cement Ltd and Kohinoor Textile Mills Ltd.
Mr Zardi said share buybacks should be discouraged because the accumulated profits being used for the exercise belong to the minority shareholders as well.“The SECP should make it mandatory for listed companies to either announce dividends or explain why they’re not declaring the same despite posting earnings. This will ensure transparency and fairness,” he said.

2,Economic slowdown triggers massive unemployment,"Industries suffer from imports curbs, foreign exchange crisis and rising input costs.","KARACHI: Millions of jobs in formal or informal sectors of the economy across the country have been lost due to a massive decline in industrial production so far this fiscal year.
The ongoing restrictions on the import of raw materials, the foreign exchange crisis and rising costs caused by surging power and gas bills have severely hampered production activities.
In four industrial sectors of Karachi and the countrywide auto vending units, stakeholders claimed that “over 500,000 people have faced joblessness.”
However, an official from the Sindh government’s Directorate of Manpower Labour Human Resource, who asked not to be named, said that the businessmen are exaggerating the figures.

Industries suffer from imports curbs, foreign exchange crisis and rising input costs

“I think joblessness in the industrial sector is in the range of 15-20pc,” he said, attributing the job crisis to various reasons, including the exchange rate problems.
When one of the analysts/report contributors at the Bureau of Statistics, Planning and Development Department of the Sindh government was approached for comment on unemployment in industries, he suggested checking the Bureau’s Monthly Industrial Production and Employment Survey (MIPE) of February.
As per MIPE, the total number of employees in 18 categories of industries in February stood at 202,663 as compared to 221,163 in February 2022. Similarly, production workers in the above categories of industries in February 2023 plunged to 151,194 from 164,791 in February 2022.
The overall number of production workers in large-scale units in February was 155,000 as compared to 165,000 in February 2022, while the total number of employees in February 2022 was 205,000 as compared to 220,000 in February 2022.
Site Association of Industry (SAI) president Riazuddin said except for the food sector, around 100,000 people out of the 500,000 in the Site area had lost their livelihood in different categories of industries, mainly from October 2022 to date.
He said that industrial activities in the area had dropped by 30-40pc with some industries either closed or suspending their one shift during the current fiscal year.
“I think 50pc more industries will close down after the withdrawal of the Rs19.99 power tariff and $9 per mmBtu gas tariff,” he feared.
Riazuddin said that the federal government’s departments, like the Sindh Bureau of Statistics (SBS) and various departments of the Sindh government, have become active since July 2022 in seeking unemployment data from industries. Businessmen are reluctant to provide any job loss data fearing any harassment from these departments, while listed firms might be presenting their workers’ data every month.
He suggested that the various provincial government departments should defer their targets of collecting taxes and levies until the revival of industrial activities.
North Karachi Association of Trade and Industry (NKATI) Chairman Faisal Moiz Khan said the area comprises nearly 5,000-6,000 small and medium-sized units of which 60pc are export-oriented, providing working opportunities to five to six million workers.
Amid an unfavourable economic situation, around 25pc of the industries have shut down their units rendering more than 100,000 contractual employees unemployed while 75pc of the industries scaled back their productions, he said.
“Nearly 30-50pc of the textile Industry in Sindh have partially shut down and their numbers will increase,” he added.
The $19.3bn export-focused industry is expecting a downward trend in global shipments in the current FY23 as loyal foreign buyers are now reluctant due to delays in order completion and shipments, he said.
Moiz said the estimated cotton production losses have been worth more than $2bn.
The domestic cotton production is significantly shorter this year than the textile sector requirements which consumed nearly 15m bales last year. The current season’s anticipated demand indicates that the textile sector will need to import 10 million bales, he added.
Chairman of the F.B. Area Association of Trade and Industry (FBATI), Haroon Shamsi, said that “currently, around 15pc of the workforce has been spared out of 320,000-380,000 workers in 1,800 units since the textile exports have been falling for many months.”
President Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI), Faraz Ur Rahman said “Over 50,000 workers have lost their jobs directly and indirectly of which 10,000 are only in pharmaceutical sectors in the Korangi industrial area due to raw material shortage as a result of import restrictions.”
Senior Vice President of the Pakistan Association of Auto Parts Accessories (PAAPAM), Usman Aslam Malik, said that the countrywide vending industry has experienced the loss of around 250,000-300,000 direct and indirect jobs due to frequent auto plant shutdowns since August 2022.
The Large-Scale Manufacturing shrank by 11.6pc in February compared to the same month 2022, while it posted a negative growth of 5.56pc in 7MFY23 on a year on year basis.

3,AJK govt looks towards centre for promised funds,Dar remains non-committal in a meeting with AJK premier Anwarul Haq.,"ISLAMABAD: Newly elected Prime Minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Anwarul Haq on Saturday met Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and reiterated the demand for the release of stuck-up funds promised by the centre for budgetary support for the current fiscal year.
The reluctance of the centre to release committed funds has put the AJK government in a tough situation to deal with the brewing financial crisis. Former AJK premier Tanveer Ilyas also met Mr Dar on Feb 25 but failed to convince him to release the funds.
A well-placed source privy to the meeting told Dawn on Saturday that the finance ministry had released Rs5 billion each for AJK, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan under the head of development funds.

Dar remains non-committal in a meeting with PM Anwarul Haq

The source said that Mr Haq also met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to secure commitment for the release of funds. The meeting with Mr Dar was a follow-up but the AJK premier failed to secure any assurance for the release of the budgetary funds related to increases in salaries and pensions, releases of development grants and a subsidy amount on wheat flour.
The PMLN-led coalition government in Budget 2022-23 reduced the recurrent budget of the AJK government by Rs15bn against the committed amount of Rs74.32bn. However, the PTI government agitated against this unlawful reduction. As a result, the federal government agreed to take the burden of an increase in salary and pensions.
As per agreement with the federal government, the financial impact of an increase in salaries and pension is Rs15bn for employees of AJK. Despite several requests, the finance ministry has yet to release this amount to AJK.
According to the source the newly appointed AJK premier also apprised the finance minister of the AJK’s economic health in the wake of non-releases of the committed amount. “We urgently need Rs11bn from the centre to pay salaries and pensions,” the source said, adding that Mr Dar was non-committal in the meeting.
On the development grants, the finance ministry has released only Rs14.2bn in the first 10 months of FY23 against the total amount of Rs28.5bn. This amount did not include the inflation factor, which would add another Rs7bn to the total Annual Development Plan for 2022-23.
The AJK government has requested the finance ministry for Rs26bn over and above the released amount to fulfil its budgetary requirements.
AJK government allocated Rs3.8bn to provide subsidised wheat flour in FY23. However, Pakistan Agricultural Storage & Services Corporation (Passco) has provided imported costly wheat pushing up the subsidy amount by Rs10bn. At the same time, AJK is still awaiting the 4G auction proceeds amounting to Rs5bn from Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.

4,"SECP issues guidelines for mergers, acquisitions",The guidelines will not apply to the mergers and acquisitions of banking companies.,"ISLAMABAD: The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has issued the first-ever guidelines related to mergers, acquisitions and amalgamations of registered companies.
The guidelines have been issued as the number of mergers and offloading shares by the companies to other entities was increasing.
However, these guidelines will not apply to the mergers and acquisitions of banking companies, as they are governed under the Banking Companies Ordinance 1962, under the State Bank of Pakistan.
A senior official of the SECP said that all mergers and amalgamations are technically known as “arrangements” therefore the guidelines have been formulated with the view to streamline all the procedures that have already been followed by entities but the relevant rules were scattered at various sets of rules.
“The cases of mergers or acquisition are increasing as the number of registered companies has increased significantly in the country,” the official said adding that the guidelines may not cover every issue or circumstance which may arise in review of a scheme of arrangement. The guidelines have listed 27 general principles providing a framework within which all the schemes of mergers are to be finalised.
All the schemes will have to be submitted to the SECP and the Commission will assess each scheme of arrangement on its merits according to the specific nature of the transaction, the industry and the potential impact in each case.
The guidelines have pointed out that the proposed scheme should not be intended to resort to monopolistic trade practices, and it should not violate any provision of law or be in conflict with the economic interest of the country or in any manner contrary to public policy or interests of the general public.

5,PSX extends weekly gains,KARACHI: Trading on the stock market commenced on a positive note in the outgoing week owing to robust financial...,"KARACHI: Trading on the stock market commenced on a positive note in the outgoing week owing to robust financial results announced by companies in major sectors.
Arif Habib Ltd said the announcement of a second buyback of shares by Lucky Cement Ltd along with the purchase of additional shares by the sponsor of Habib Bank Ltd further boosted the sentiment.
The trade deficit came down 40 per cent year-on-year to settle at $24 billion in the first 10 months of 2022-23, keeping the momentum bullish.
However, inflation for April rose to a historic high of 36.4pc year-on-year. The rupee appreciated by 0.01pc from the preceding week to settle at 283.59 against the dollar. Meanwhile, reserves of the central bank arrived at $4.5bn, down $6 million from a week ago.
As a result, the benchmark index of the stock market closed at 42,242 points after gaining 661 points or 1.6pc from the preceding week.
Sector-wise, positive contributions came from commercial banking (252 points), cement (247 points), fertiliser (67 points), food and personal care products (64 points) and paper and board (60 points).
Sectors that contributed negatively were exploration and production (86 points), technology (51 points) and auto assembling (36 points).
According to AKD Securities, any positive development on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) front and political stability will further boost the confidence of investors.
However, the upside is expected to remain limited owing to record high interest rates and rampant inflation, it added. “We advise that investors should take a cautious approach while building positions in the market,” it said, adding that stocks with dollar-denominated revenue streams, like technology and exploration and production, should be in focus.

6,Millers for cheaper wheat imports,Ask govt to allow import of wheat as it is available at cheaper rates due to the arrival of fresh crops.,"ISLAMABAD: Slamming bureaucracy for its utter failure in ensuring fair prices to consumers by nabbing the exploiters, the flour millers have asked the government to allow the import of wheat as it is available at cheaper rates due to the arrival of fresh crops.
Addressing a news conference on Saturday, Pakistan Flour Mills Association, Punjab Chapter, Chairman Asim Raza Ahmed slammed the traders and bureaucracy, whom he called the exploiters for raising the price of wheat within a few hours after the news of bumper wheat crop broke out.
He said that wheat was currently cheap on the international markets due to the arrival of fresh crops whereas it was getting expensive in Pakistan.
“There is no smuggling to Afghanistan, it is the wrong and unfair notion and the bureaucracy is deceiving the whole nation,” he said, adding that the official reports were categorising the movement of wheat from one city to another city in Punjab as smuggling.
Responding to a query if the food department officials were to be blamed for the high prices of wheat flour in the country, Mr Raza said, “Yes. Our problems cannot be solved unless the bureaucracy stops extending a free hand to market exploiters who are running their unfair businesses without any fear.”
“The best solution is to import wheat this will hit the hoarders and the consumers will get cheaper flour,” Mr Raza suggested.
The flour miller also demanded that the government should allow free transportation of wheat, flour and other by-products throughout Pakistan.
They said that not only the flour mills but even the general public were facing financial trouble as well as accessibility issues related to wheat flour – which was the basic diet in Pakistan.
Vice-Chairman Syed Raza Shah highlighted that wheat flour was not available in Peshawar even at Rs180 per kg and there is a shortage of flour even now after the arrival of fresh wheat crop and more than 130 flour mills in Rawalpindi alone have been closed.
He added that as the country was suffering from political instability the wheat flour crisis was created by the hoarders themselves to exploit the situation and make windfalls. 
He, however, warned that the situation will become irreversible if urgent steps are not taken by the government.
