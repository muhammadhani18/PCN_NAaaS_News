About 30 feet wide breach occurred on Friday night that was partially filled by the local farmers on Saturday but not before the water had inundated farms of vegetables, turmeric and fodder.  
According to the farmers, the crops that were already under threat due to the recent spell of rain would be badly damaged by the water that entered their fields from Rajba.  
The farmers blamed the irrigation department for not plugging the canal to control the water flow. They also alleged that despite repeated complaints, the officials concerned did not reach the spot to minimize the damage.  
SHOT: Robbers shot a man on resistance at village Jaggat Singh in the limits of Sara-i-Mughal Police Station.  
According to complainant Abdul Sattar, two unidentified robbers were searching a car parked at a petrol pump. When they found nothing, they put a pipe in the car tank and started drawing petrol from it.

1,Wasa launches Leh Nullah desilting project,RAWALPINDI: The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) has launched a month-long Leh Nullah and trunk sewer desilting in...,"RAWALPINDI: The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) has launched a month-long Leh Nullah and trunk sewer desilting in the downtown through wench machines with an estimated cost of Rs30 million to avoid flood like situation in the garrison city in coming monsoon.
The campaign will end by June 30.
The caretaker Punjab government has released the amount to Wasa in March and directed to start the work. The government wanted to complete the work without any further delay.
Wasa spokesman Umer Farooq told  Dawn on Friday that the agency would spend Rs30 million to clear the obstacles in the nullah to avoid flood like situation in the coming monsoon.
He said that there were reports that the coming monsoon will be aggressive and there was a dire need to remove the mud and any other obstacle in the smooth flow of rainwater coming from the capital city and adjoining nullahs.
He said that the drive started in May and it would be completed by end of June. He said that the dredging would improve the water flow up to two feet. He said that the target would be achieved within stipulated timeline.
“Apart from Leh Nullah dredging, Wasa also launched the work to desilt secondary and trunk sewer through Wench Machine before the advent of monsoon,” he said.
He said through the cleaning of sewer in the garrison city, total population will be served 1.7 million and total lateral sewer measuring 190km, secondary sewer 49km and trunk sewer 35km will be cleared.
He said that these sewage lines installed in Fauji Colony, Khayaban-i-Sir Syed, Mohanpura, Bhabra Bazaar, Satellite Town and  Arya Mohallah.
The last flood that Leh witnessed was on July 23, 2001. Just a few hours of 620mm rain resulted in the worst floods in the city’s history. Thirty-five people lost their lives while many slums were swept away resulting in financial loss worth millions.
If heavy rains occurred in the twin cities then the Nullah Leh water level would raise 18 feet touching dangerous level. 
Leh Nullah was full of hundreds of thousands of polythene bags that adversely affect the water flow.
Leh Nullah has a length of about 30km, stretching from Islamabad to Rawalpindi. 11 big nullahs of the city also discharged into Leh Nullah from different areas. Leh Nullah discharged in Soan River near the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench.

2,Rankers in Islamabad police ‘deprived’ of due promotion,Only one ex-cadre officer appointed as 14 seats reserved for rankers remain vacant,"ISLAMABAD: The ex-cadre officers of the capital police are being deprived of their due right of promotion, as instead of promoting them against the vacant seats in the capital police, concerned authorities have been deputing officers from other departments.
Due to the violation of rights to promotion, 14 seats reserved for the ex-cadre officers out of 15 were left vacant. Officers of the capital police told Dawn that there were 38 seats from grade-18 (Superintendent of Police) to grade-21 (Inspector General of Police).
As per the quota, 15 seats are reserved for rankers while the remaining seats are meant for the Police Services of Pakistan (PSP), they added. Out of the 15 seats, there was only one officer of the SP rank in the capital police, they said, adding that the capital police had 20 seats for the grade-18 officers, and out of the total, 11 were occupied by PSPs.
Regarding the 18 other seats from grade-19 (SSP) to grade-21, at least 11 were occupied by PSPs, including an SSP whose encadrement in the PSP group was made by the establishment division from the ex-cadre group earlier after a year of his promotion to grade-18.

Only one ex-cadre officer appointed as 14 seats reserved for rankers remain vacant

An officer cannot be promoted from grade-18 to grade-19 (SSP) until his encadrement is made in the PSP group, they said, adding that after one year of promotion to grade-18 (SP), the IGP is required to recommend these officers to the establishment division for induction into the PSP group.
Meanwhile, the 15 seats reserved for the ex-cadre officers cannot be given to the PSP officers in any case, they said, adding that the eligible officers would be promoted to grade-18 (SP) from grade-17 (DSP) by a promotion board constituted by the interior ministry. In light of Police Order 2002, the police chief can also promote eligible officers to vacant seats, they added.
The last promotion of ex-cadre officers to grade-18 took place in 2021, they said adding that recently, two SPs from the PSP group were transferred to the capital police; both were from the Pakistan Railways and after reaching grade-18, the establishment division made their encadrement in the PSP group.
Currently, only one ex-cadre officer of grade-18 is working in the capital police, they said, adding that last month one ex-cadre SP Tahir Khan was transferred to Balochistan on deputation, while the rest of the 13 seats reserved for rankers were either vacant or given to the PSPs in violation of the quota system. On some seats, DSPs were working via shoulder promotion.
SP Tahir Khan was transferred to Balochistan on deputation by the establishment division at the request of the IGP, despite the fact that he was not a PSP officer, they said. The IGP made SP Khan a scapegoat to save his skin along with the DIG Operations and SSP CTD after the quarters concerned expressed displeasure for not getting the desired result in a case registered against PTI leaders in connection with violence outside the judicial complex on March 18.
The officers said that despite the availability of eligible officers, quota, and seats, the procedure to promote the grade-17 officers to grade-18 is yet to be initiated, adding that five DSPs are given shoulder promotions despite rulings of the SC. The word ‘officiating’ is used to give the five officers the rank of SP, keeping in view of the SC ruling against the shoulder promotion, the officers said.
Besides, there were 50 seats for grade-17 officers in the capital -- 41 for DSPs (ex-cadres) and nine for ASPs (Assistant Superintendents of Police), the officers said, adding that out of the total 41 seats, as many as 12 DSP seats were laying vacant, besides, some inspectors are also working on the DSP seats too.
Despite the availability of the eligible officers, the procedure has yet to start for the promotion of a grade-16 officer (inspector) to a grade-17 (DSP), they said, adding that however, the IGP Islamabad brought two DSPs from the Punjab police on deputation.
Former DSP Legal Azhar Shah, talking to Dawn, said that as per the Federal Services Act 1973, a 40 per cent quota was reserved for ex-cadres and a 60 per cent quota was reserved for the PSPs. PSPs cannot be appointed on the quota reserved for rankers, he added.
As per the Services Rules, an officer of the Federal Service (CSS) could be appointed or transferred anywhere in Pakistan, the retired DSP said, adding that SP Khan was an officer of Islamabad, having a status of a province, but he was not an officer of the federal.
The rule of transfer on deputation – as per Estacode transfers on deputation can only be made through the process of selection – was violated in SP Khan’s case, as the demand of the officer from Balochistan by the province’s IGP and the selection procedure were not mentioned in the notification issued by the establishment division, the former police officer, who is now a high court lawyer, added.
When contacted, Police Publication Branch head DIG Headquarters Awais Ahmed replied that these were policy issues and only the IGP could reply. Jawad Taqi is PRO, he replied when asked if he was not the in-charge of the PPB. PRO Jawad Taqi was also approached for comments, but he did not reply. The IGP was also not available for comments despite attempts.

3,Task forces to ensure functioning of dams,RAWALPINDI: Commissioner Rawalpindi Liaquat Ali Chattha has formed task forces to identify and resolve issues...,"RAWALPINDI: Commissioner Rawalpindi Liaquat Ali Chattha has formed task forces to identify and resolve issues creating hurdles in the smooth functioning of dams.
Presiding over a meeting held to discuss issues related to small dams, he said steps were being taken to activate the dams across the division on the special instructions of the Punjab chief secretary.
Director Development Nazia Sudhan, Project Director Irrigation Tabriz Elahi, Project Director Small Dams Hamza Sheikh and other officers attended the meeting.
The task force formed on each dam will include concerned assistant commissioner as the convener, assistant director agriculture, assistant director water management, deputy director irrigation and four notables from the area benefiting by the dam.
The commissioner said he will start visiting the dams from the coming week.  He the task force after completing homework would brief him about the ground realities.
Mr Chattha said the government had spent billions of rupees on the dams built in Rawalpindi division.  
Now, if these dams are not fully functional due to minor issues or negligence of the department it is a matter of an extreme abuse.
Mr Chattha said construction of new dams and functioning of existing dams was the urgent need of the hour.  Since Pakistan is an agricultural country, water is needed not only for drinking and general use but also for agriculture.
Unfortunately, Pakistan is one of the countries that will face severe water shortage in the near future.  
In such a case, thousands cusecs of water is lost every year in rains which can be stored by increasing the capacity of existing dams and constructing new dams.  
This can also reduce the risk of flooding.
Giving a briefing on the existing dams, the meeting was told that there were 23 dams in  Chakwal and Talagang with a gross storage of 185,576 cusecs out of which 19 dams had been completed and made operational while four were under construction.
Khokhar Zaman Dam, Walana Dam, Surya Dam, Dhoke Qutbuddin, Nika Dam, Kot Raja Dam, Khai Dam, Ghazial Dam, Dhoke Thalian, Mandi Dam, Dhoke Jhang, Manwal Dam and Arar Mughal Dam of Chakwal are complete.  Similarly, completed dams in Talagang included Gharabi Dam, Dharnal Dam, Bhagtal Dam, Para Fathal Dam, Mial Dam and Dhoke Hum Dam. Dharabi Dam and Uthwal dams in Chakwal and Taman Dam and Ghabir Dam in Talagang are under construction.
About Rawalpindi, the commissioner was told that there were a total of nine dams in the district, out of which four were in Rawalpindi tehsil and five in Gujar Khan.  Rawalpindi district has Misriot Dam, Khasala Dam, Jawa Dam and Chahan Dam - all are functional.
Gujar Khan tehsil has Narali Dam, Dungi Dam, Philina Dam, Ughan Dam and Jamal Dam.  All of them except Jamal Dam are functional.
The commissioner directed that a detailed report should be submitted after evaluating the problems faced in activation of Jamal Dam.
After its completion, it will undoubtedly meet the shortage of domestic, agricultural and industrial water. Also, the construction of Mahuta Dam is being given importance because it will not only save abundant rainwater every year but will also reduce the risk of flooding.
An official from Small  Dam Organisation said five dams in Rawalpindi district had been included in the annual development programme (ADP).
Physical progress on Mahotah Dam worth Rs3,891 million is currently 35pc and on Mujahid Dam worth Rs1,790 million it is 85pc. The physical progress on Mehra Shera Dam worth Rs1,128 million is 71pc and Daducha Dam 15pc. Moreover, PC-I of Papin Dam worth Rs14,480 million was also approved recently.

4,PAC divided over taking up case against SC judge,Justice Mazahar Ali Naqvi is facing allegations of keeping assets beyond means.," 

Mushahid Hussain Sayed

ISLAMABAD: The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the parliament is divided over the issue of taking up the case of Supreme Court (SC) judge Justice Mazahar Ali Naqvi, who is facing allegations of keeping assets beyond means, Dawn has learnt.
The resentment within the PAC members, including those belonging to the ruling coalition, came to the surface at a time when the National Assembly Secretariat has already issued notices to them for a meeting scheduled to be held on Monday (tomorrow) to take up the case against the SC judge.
The matter had been referred to the PAC by Deputy Speaker Zahid Akram Durrani on the demand of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader and federal minister Sardar Ayaz Sadiq during the National Assembly’s sitting on May 4 with the directive to come up with a report within 15 days.
The PML-N leader had raised the issue on a point of order during the Question Hour as lawmakers continued their assault on the superior court judges in the wake of ongoing executive-judiciary tussle over the issue of elections to the Punjab Assembly.

Registrar already summoned on May 16 over alleged failure of apex court to audit its accounts in last 10 years

Headed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) dissident Noor Alam Khan, the PAC has already summoned the SC registrar on May 16 over the alleged failure of the apex court to audit its accounts in the last 10 years.
When contacted, a number of PAC members stated that they believed that the case of the SC judge did not fall in the domain of the PAC and if the government had any evidence against a judge, it should properly file a reference against him in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
 

Dr Ramesh Kumar

“This is not the domain of the PAC. The Constitution provides a mechanism for the judges’ accountability through the SJC,” said PML-N Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed while talking to Dawn.
The PML-N senator said the government should not repeat the same mistake committed by the previous PTI regime which had moved a similar reference against Justice Qazi Faiz Isa and which backfired. He said they should simply follow the constitution, instead of setting new and wrong precedents.
Similarly, Dr Ramesh Kumar of the PTI said he had already discussed the matter with a number of PAC members and some of them were of the view that taking up the individual cases did not fall in their domain. He, however, said there were many members in the 28-member PAC, who believed that they could take up the matter as it was related to the financial benefits which the judges were availing through the national exchequer.
Dr Kumar said if there was any wrongdoing in the tax returns of the judge, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) should intimate the cabinet, which could then recommend formally moving a reference against that judge in the SJC.
 

Saleem Mandviwala

Senator Saleem Mandviwala of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) also said it was not the domain of the PAC to take up individual cases. The job of the PAC, according to Mr Mandviwala, was only to examine the audit reports sent to it by the auditor general of Pakistan.
Mr Mandviwala said he might not be able to attend the Monday’s meeting, but would convey it to the PAC chairman that they should refer the case to some other department.
It may be recalled that while raising the issue in the National Assembly, Mr Sadiq had stated that various bar councils had already filed references with the SJC against Justice Naqvi, adding such allegations were tarnishing the image of judiciary.
Mr Sadiq, who served as speaker of the National Assembly under the previous PML-N government, had said the PAC should seek assistance from the FBR and the Accountant General Pakistan Aevenue to probe the matter.
He said the investigation must find out sources of the judge’s income “to purchase a plot worth over Rs100 million and carrying out construction on it.” Besides conducting special audit of the matter, he added, the FBR should be asked to also provide details of taxes paid by the judge.
The minister said it was unfortunate that people were pointing fingers at judges of superior courts because of such allegations, adding the proposed investigation would provide an opportunity to the judge to come clean on the matter.
The deputy speaker referred the matter to the PAC for investigation and audit under Rule 199 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly 2007 with the directive to complete the task within 15 days.
Rule 199, ‘Reference to Standing Committee’ reads: “Except as otherwise provided in these rules, the Assembly or the Speaker may remit to the standing committee any subject or matter with which it is concerned and the standing committee shall study such subject or matter with a view to suggest legislation or making recommendations to the Assembly.”
Four references are pending against Justice Naqvi in the SJC in which he has been accused of “misconduct”, “misuse of authority” and keeping assets beyond known sources of income.

5,33 people arrested after ‘stray bullet’ grazes police officer,RAWALPINDI: Rawal Division SP Faisal Saleem was injured in a firing in the air incident on Friday night prompting ...,"RAWALPINDI: Rawal Division SP Faisal Saleem was injured in a firing in the air incident on Friday night prompting the police to launch a massive crackdown against those involved in jubilation fire and use of fireworks in the vicinity of Holy Family Hospital.
In the operation that followed the incident, at least 33 people were detained in the limits of the New Town police station for their alleged involvement in a fireworks display and jubilation fire during a wedding ceremony.
Police said the episode occurred after SP Faisal Saleem visited the Holy Family Hospital in connection with an investigation into a firing incident that occurred in Pirwadhai area. Around midnight, a stray bullet grazed his head, injuring him critically.
The SP sustained a head injury and was immediately removed to the emergency ward where he was given first aid and later different medical tests were conducted. After his condition was described as stable and out of danger, he was allowed to go home.
A police spokesman said that a grand operation was started late at night in the areas located around the Holy Family and 33 people were detained in connection with firing in the air and fireworks display. 
The police claimed the accused resisted the police and fired at the police to avoid arrest.
During the raid, one Kalashnikov, one 12-bore rifle, two pistols along with bullets and cartridges were recovered from the accused, the police said, claiming fireworks and ‘liquor bottles’ were also recovered from the accused.
CPO Syed Khalid Mahmood Hamdani said, “Those people who play with the lives of citizens for their temporary pleasure cannot escape from the grip of the law.” Rawal Faisal Saleem’s health is now improving and he is undergoing treatment, said the CPO.
It may be mentioned here that jubilation fire in the garrison city has claimed the lives of innocent people and left many injured in the past. 
Ahead of Eid, the Nur Khan Air Base authorities also asked the police and district administration to impose Section 144 and launch a search operation in the surrounding areas of the base to curb firing in the air.
An incident which caused the closure of flying operation by the PAF at Nur Khan Airbase on February 24, 2023 and disturbed the prime minister’s departure to Lahore due to flight safety situation had been reported and led to the removal of two DSPs and three SHOs for their failure to keep a lid on jubilation fire.
An FIR had been registered with the airport police on the complaint of the chief protocol officer under relevant sections of the law. 
But aerial firing still continues unabated in the garrison city.
A car in the security detail of the prime minister was also struck by an aerial stray bullet that penetrated through its roof when it was parked in the base terminal. However, the driver remained unhurt.
After such an incident happens in which human life is lost or injured, the police repeat the same old tactics — launch raids, detain several people, recover some weapons — to curb the practice, but so far they have not been unable to control incidents of firing in the air.

6,Police detain over 20 PTI supporters in Islamabad,JIT summons Imran to appear before it at Police Lines on May 10 and 11.,"ISLAMABAD: Police on Saturday detained more than 20 Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers, including three women, for allegedly creating a law and order situation and getting into a physical confrontation with the officials during a rally taken out by the party to express solidarity with the Supreme Court.
Police sources said 12 supporters, including three women, were arrested by the Saddar Zone police while over a dozen were detained by the Rural Zone police and kept at various police stations.
According to the police, they were ordered to remain lenient with the participants of the rally in order to avoid a confrontation with participants during the movement of the visiting Chinese delegation. Some of the participants, who violated Section 144 and blocked traffic, were subsequently detained after the Chinese delegation left.
At least 11 participants were arrested from outside Mehran Gate of F-9 Park, they said, adding that later nine men and three women were shifted to the Margalla and Women police stations, respectively. In Rural Zone, over a dozen participants were detained and moved to police stations.

JIT summons Imran to appear before it at Police Lines on May 10, 11th

They were being kept on the premises of police stations as the authorities concerned have not decided how to proceed against these protesters: to formally arrest them after registration of FIR or let them go with a warning. 
There is a possibility that a case may register against those who were involved in a physical confrontation with the police, they added.
Earlier, the capital administration denied permission to PTI to hold the Public rally, the officers said, adding that the PTI took out the rally without permission. 
The letter issued to PTI’s Islamabad President Ali Nawaz Awan said that it was observed that the visit of the foreign minister along with the delegation coincided with the proposed rally. 
“Allowing the rally on this route will disrupt the security of the VIP movement.” It also mentioned that in the past, the PTI had not complied with the terms of the administration despite the submission of an affidavit, leading to a law and order situation.
Meanwhile, the police summoned PTI’s chief Imran Khan on May 10 and May 11 concerning four separate cases registered at the Counter Terrorism Department of Ramna and Golra police stations. Imran Khan was asked to appear before the JIT at 2pm at Police Lines Headquarters, Sector H-11, on both days. The said cases against Mr Khan were lodged in Feb and March.
He was asked to appear before the JIT for investigation, and bring evidence and witnesses in his favour, the police officials said, adding that legal action would be taken against him in case he failed to appear before the JIT.
‘Civil martial law’
PTI Islamabad President Ali Nawaz Awan lashed out at the government for not permitting the party to hold its rally in the federal capital and alleged that a ‘civil martial law’ was enforced in Pakistan.
Addressing a press conference along with PTI leader Babar Awan, the former MNA said that the rally had to start from Zero Point and culminate at F-9 Park. 
Ali Awan claimed that they submitted an application to the district administration for permission but the admin refused to grant permission despite the judge’s order.
Speaking on the occasion, PTI leader Babar Awan said that his party would seek contempt of court action against the deputy commissioner for not allowing permission for the rally despite a high court order.
Babar Awan said that they were also going to file a petition to the Supreme Court against this “civil dictatorship”. The decision of the apex court regarding the Punjab polls on May 14 was in accordance with the Constitution, he said, suggesting that strict action should be taken against those who violated the Constitution. Similarly, he said that action should be taken against all those officials who were called and asked to release election funds by April 27.
While mentioning a joint investigation team formed to interrogate Imran Khan, Mr Awan said that the JIT asked ‘funny’ questions. He added that the questions were not prepared by the JIT team; hence the PTI did not accept the investigation team. The PTI would challenge its constitution, he added.
He sought the intervention of the Supreme Court, saying “citizens have been under siege in the federal capital because public gatherings and rallies” were not allowed in the capital for the last 13 months.
Separately, the PTI women’s wing in Wah also took out a rally in solidarity with the Supreme Court and Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial amid a standoff between the superior judiciary and the government. Addressing the rally, PTI leader Kalsoom Chaudhury said that the PTI was taking to the streets to express solidarity with the Constitution and Supreme Court. — Amjad Iqbal from Taxila also contributed to this report

12,NA committee set to take up 20 bills on Tuesday,"Prohibition of kite flying, Pakistan citizenship bills up for discussion.","ISLAMABAD: A National Assembly committee has a heavy legislative agenda on May 9 during which it will take up nearly 20 bills and also discuss matters of public importance and calling attention notices.
Besides deliberating on the Pakistan Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2022 and The Pure Food Authority Bill, 2020, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Interior will discuss amendment to section 6 in the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.
The bill’s mover, PPP MNA Qadir Khan Mandokhail, sought insertion of the expression, “use of corrosive substance which is deleterious to human body”.
The mover maintained that acid throwing burn crimes were increasing day by day. Hundreds of women and children had been harmed as a result of this horrendous act. Because of the socio-economic situation pertaining to victim, the fear and stigma they confronted, as well as highly complex nature of acid and burn injuries, a deterrent legislation was requested.

Prohibition of kite flying, Pakistan citizenship bills up for discussion

The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997 had as its primary goal the prevention of terrorism as well as the speedy trials of heinous offence. It was critical to include use of corrosive substance in Anti-terrorism Act, he said in the statement of objectives.
Similarly, another crucial legislation will be discussed seeking complete ban on kite flying in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) and suggesting stern punishment to the violators.
The Prohibition of Kite Flying Bill 2021 that had been moved by James Iqbal, a minority member belonging to Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), as a private member bill some two years ago, had been placed on the agenda of the committee meeting.
Mr Iqbal had stated that he was tabling the bill with an aim to save precious human lives as well as public and private properties of the residents of the capital city by ensuring strict ban on manufacturing of kites and its metallic strings, sale, purchase and usage.
According to him, the bill had been introduced in accordance with Article 9 of the Constitution, which ensured that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty.
The MNA was of the view that by introducing exemplary punishments, the law enforcing departments would perform better to eliminate illegal kite flying under the zero-tolerance policy.
Through the bill, the mover had suggested that those found manufacturing kites or chemical string (Maanjha) could face imprisonment of up to 10 years, which shall not be less than five years or a fine from Rs500,000 to Rs1 million.
Likewise, another important legislation to be discussed is ‘The Employment of Children Amendment Bill 2022’ moved by MNA Kesoomal Kheal Das.
The mover argued that the intent behind the amendments were not to promote child labour but prohibit employment of children. This amendment bill therefore proposed change of title of the act to fix lacunae in the existing law.
The meeting will also be seeking amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill 2022, moved by MNA Qadir Khan Mandokhail, the Criminal Laws Amendment Bill 2020, moved by MNA Chaudhry Faqir Ahmad, and the Provincial Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill 2020 moved by MNA Mohsin Dawar.
The meeting will also take up a matter of public interest, following directives from the prime minister regarding fixing responsibility for death of children due to non-admission in burn centre.

13,National police hospital project revived,"In 2018, its estimated cost was Rs2 billion, which has now been increased to over Rs6 billion","ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives has revived the national police hospital project which was abandoned in 2019, a year after its approval.
In 2018, its estimated cost was Rs2 billion which has now increased to over Rs6 billion.
Officers of the capital police said the hospital was a brainchild of former inspector general of police (IGP) Islamabad Dr Sultan Azam Temuri, who requested the then interior minister Ahsan Iqbal to approve the project. 
In April 2018, Ahsan Iqbal, during a police meeting (Darbar) announced that the government would allocate Rs2 billion in 2018-19 budget for the hospital. 
In 2018-2019, an amount of Rs1 billion was allocated for the project, but Central Development Working Party (CDWP) or Dvisional Development Working Party (DDWP) did not approve it.

In 2018, its estimated cost was Rs2 billion, which has now been increased to over Rs6 billion

During the tenure of the previous government, the project was shelved after the then IGP asked the government that there was no need for the hospital and the amount reserved for it should be diverted to other projects, they said. As a result, the project was abandoned and not included in the new and ongoing schemes/projects announced in the budget of 2019-20.
After coming into power last year, PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal, who is now Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, again got it approved.
According to an office memorandum issued by Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, the PC-I has been received and the CDWP in its meeting held on March 2 approved the project with the direction that sponsors shall consolidate and work out final firmed up cost of the project as per current CSP for issuance of authorisation accordingly, the memorandum said. An oversight committee with representation from project wing of the ministry and relevant stakeholders shall be constituted to keep check on quality and progress of the project.
The minister directed the authorities concerned to issue authorisation, “if sponsors submit final cost estimates”.
In compliance with the Islamabad IGP in a letter addressed to planning secretary certified that final firmed up cost of the project is Rs6479.879 million and submitted the modified PC-I accordingly which is examined by health section and endorsed the issuance of authorisation of the project in light of above directions of the minister.
As per the summary of the approved cost of the project, including Rs3,166,807 million for hospital buildings is followed by Rs1,812.678 million for equipment and furniture cost, Rs254.145 million for escalation, Rs216.345 million for consultancy cost, supervision charges and third party validation, Rs197.738 million for doctors’ accommodation, Rs170.027 million for entrance check post, cafeteria and CCTV room, Rs164 million for services/infrastructure works, Rs129.616 million for external electrification and street lights, Rs118.006 million for contingencies, Rs105.360 million for external development work and Rs46.210 million for departmental charges,
The sponsor agency may issue administrative approval of the project at a total cost of Rs6,479.879 million in accordance with CDWP decision, the memorandum said, adding the implementation period of the project is 36 months which may also be reflected in administrative approval.
The hospital will provide state of the art health facilities to over 10,000 personnel of the capital police. The 100-bed National Police Hospital will have treatment facilities including surgical and medical intensive care units, cardiac care intensive unit and departments of cardiology, neurology and medicine.
