0,SC imposes fine on defence ministry in food contract case,"Petitioner wasted court time by filing ""frivolous claim"", bench observes.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Friday imposed a fine of Rs100,000 on the Ministry of Defence for abusing the process of law for filing a vexatious and frivolous claims and thus wasting the precious time of courts.
A three-judge bench comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Shahid Waheed rejected the plea moved by the defence ministry against the dismissal of their plea by the Lahore High Court on Sept 7, 2020.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, in a four-page order he authored, imposed a fine of Rs100,000 and directed the petitioner to deposit the costs in a charitable organisation of their choice within a month from the receipt of the order and acknowledged the same to the Supreme Court registrar for perusal of judges in chambers.
The case concerns filing of a suit by the defence ministry for the recovery of Rs912,801 against Ms Farrukh International (Pvt) Ltd through its proprietor Mrs Firdous Munawar (respondent) on account of breach of a contract awarded to for the supply of certain food items. 

Petitioner wasted court time by filing ‘frivolous claim’, bench observes

A civil judge of Rawalpindi through a Feb 22, 2014 decree had dismissed the suit, holding that the petitioners had failed to prove their claim. The appeal filed against the judgement and decree of the trial court was also first dismissed by additional district judge of Rawalpindi and then by the Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi bench.
The SC in its order observed that the petitioners had relied on a contract that admittedly pertains to financial and future obligations and therefore the initial burden of proving the case and the documents was on the petitioner. 
Despite the fact that the defendant was proceeded against ex-parte, the trial court in order to satisfy itself with regard to the execution of certain documents to prove the case, exercised its discretion by asking the petitioner to produce evidence in their support, the judgement recalled. 
It said the law provided a procedure for production of documents through the person concerned along with its original record. If the procedure for production of the document was not followed in the manner prescribed by law, the same could not be taken into consideration, the apex court explained.
According to the court order, the petitioner produced the document through their representative who neither prepared nor attested the same. Even the original record of the documents was not produced in the trial court for comparison. Besides, production of the marginal witnesses of the documents in the court is a condition but the needful was not done. Thus, the petitioners have failed to prove the execution of the documents relied upon, the order said, adding the courts below after proper adjudication of the matter concurrently refused to grant relief to the petitioners and dismissed the suit.

1,Face-off with PBC leaves SCBA fragmented,A majority of the SCBA has restrained the association’s president and secretary from taking unilateral decisions.,"ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: One of the country’s premier lawyers bodies, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), stands fragmented as a majority group has restrained the association’s president and secretary from taking unilateral decisions.
The group also disapproved the move to challenge the show-cause notices and de-seating of the SCBA secretary and additional secretary by the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC). Ten of the 17 members of the SCBA executive committee passed a resolution stating that they will not support any proceedings against the PBC, which was a regulator of all bar associations, including the SCBA.
Earlier on Friday, an online meeting by the group expressed no confidence in the association’s president Abid S. Zuberi. The move, which could have resulted in Mr Zuberi’s removal, was stayed by the Sindh High Court (SHC) on Saturday.
In its interim order, the SHC suspended the SCBA resolution to de-seat its president till May 18. Justice Nadeem Akhtar also suspended till the next hearing the PBC order to summon some SCBA officer-bearers for not complying with the resolution passed by its executive committee to remove Mr Zuberi.
The order was issued after Mr Zuberi and other SCBA members filed two suits against the resolution and the PBC order. 
This was the latest development in the tussle that has pitted the PBC and the SCBA against each other after the former issued show-cause notices to and de-seated two SCBA secretary Muqtedir Akhtar Shabbir and additional secretary Malik Shakeelur Rehman. 
In a tit-for-tat move, SCBA also suspended the membership of seven PBC executive committee members and even took the matter to the Supreme Court.
On Saturday, the plaintiffs’ lawyers argued before the SHC that the resolution following the May 4 meeting was politically motivated, against the rules and illegal. 
They contended that the PBC had summoned the administration officer and other SCBA representatives on May 9 to explain their non-compliance with the resolution passed by 10 of the 17 SCBA executive committee members.
The PBC’s action was coram non-judice as it has no right to interfere in the affairs and management of the SCBA, the lawyers argued, adding that the order was arbitrary, discriminatory and against the principles of justice.
Following the arguments, the bench issued notices to the defendants to appear on May 18.

2,Landslide cuts off Balochistan’s road link with KP,Officials say landslide occurred near Dhanasar area of Dera Ismail Khan.,"QUETTA: Balochistan’s land route with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was cut off on Saturday after a landslide on the highway connecting Zhob to Dera Ismail Khan.
According to officials, the lan­dslide occurred near Dhanasar area of D.I. Khan, leaving a large number of vehicles, including passenger coaches, trucks and cars stranded on both sides.
A senior official of Balochistan Levies told Dawn that passengers, including women and children, are stuck due to the landslide which started suddenly despite no rainfall. No loss of life has so far been reported.
The National Highway Autho­rity North General Manager Inayatullah Agha said machinery and NHA staff had reached the site and started removing the boulders.
He said traffic was expected to be restored by late at night once the highway is cleared.
In April, the Kuchlak-D.I. Khan N-50 highway connecting the two provinces, was blocked after torrential rains caused landslides in Balochistan’s Sherani district.
The torrential rains in KP’s bordering mountains and the Koh-i-Sulaiman also caused intense flooding in the border areas, leaving a large number of passenger buses and smaller vehicles stranded.

3,"After botched raid on Parvez Elahi’s house, Lahore police operations chief replaced","Official says Lahore DIG Operations Afzaal Kausar ""sacrificed"" to shield Model Town Division SP Ammara Sherazi.","LAHORE: The Punjab caretaker government on Saturday transferred Lahore DIG Operations Afzaal Kausar days after the police raid on the residence of Chaudhry Parvez Elahi that also spilt over into the adjoining house of Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, causing an outcry from the key government ally.
The transfer order came days after interim chief minister of Punjab Mohsin Naqvi visited the PML-Q president’s residence and assured him that action would be taken against those responsible for misuse of authority during an ‘unreasonable police raid’ for the arrest of the former CM.
However, a police official told Dawn that DIG Kausar was made a scapegoat for the botched raid on Mr Elahi’s residence. He said that the incident had brought embarrassment even for the PML-N ruling in the Centre after some reports emerged that the armed police personnel forcibly entered the adjoining residence of Chaudhry Shujaat.
In order to pacify Shujaat Hussain, the federal government had also distanced itself from the operation.

Official says DIG Kausar ‘sacrificed’ to shield Model Town Division SP

‘Scapegoat’
Lahore Model Town Division SP Ammara Sherazi who was leading the police operation at that time initially came on the radar for mismanagement and excessive use of force during the raid, but she was ‘rescued’ by some senior police officers in Lahore and the Central Police Office, official sources said.
These officers urged the police chief to tip the scales in SP’s favour and the entire blame was shifted on DIG Afzaal Kausar, who was not on good terms with Lahore police chief Bilal Siddique Kamyana, the police official told Dawn.
He said the Lahore capital city police officer (CCPO) was already unhappy with the “poor command” of DIG Kausar during the ‘failed operations’ at Zaman Park to arrest PTI chief Imran Khan.
Similarly, the CCPO and Lahore Investigation DIG Sohail Akthar Sukhera, too, were not on good terms when the former questioned the latter for not achieving targets he had assigned him for the completion of the challan pertaining to the old criminal cases.
New Lahore Ops chief
The raid on Elahi’s residence provided the caretaker government with a much-needed chance to intervene and put the police department in order, starting with DIG Kausar’s, who has been replaced by DIG Ali Nasir Rizvi.
The Punjab police chief considered the names of DIG IT Ahsan Younis, DIG Zeshan Asghar, Gujranwala CPO Rana Ayaz Saleem and Mr Rizvi for the appointment. Mr Younis and Zeeshan Asghar categorically refused to serve in Lahore, landing Mr Rizvi in the position

4,"LHC accepts apology of ACE, police",Disposes of Elahi's petition seeking contempt proceedings against ACE and police for conducting a raid on his residence.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has accepted the unconditional apologies tendered by officials of the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) and the police and disposed of a petition of former chief minister Parvez Elahi seeking contempt proceedings against ACE and police for conducting a raid on his residence.
Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh announced the reserved verdict on Saturday. Mr Elahi had sought contempt proceedings against the officials for alleged violation of a court’s order of granting pre-arrest bail to him. He also sought action against ACE Additional DG Waqasul Hassan for uttering “derogatory remarks” about the court.
The judge had issued show cause notices to the officials for contempt proceedings.
The replies filed by the officials revealed that there were two FIRs against the petitioner. They said the high court granted the petitioner bail in one FIR while the ACE proceeded against him in the other case.
In his order, Justice Sheikh observed the respondents were not inclined to proceed against them on the allegation of contempt of the bail order. However, the judge said the petitioner would be free to avail appropriate legal remedies if the respondents made any excesses.
As regards the second allegation, which was against Mr Hassan in particular, the judge observed that all the respondents submitted their unconditional apologies and placed themselves at the mercy of the court. “Their apology is accepted,” the judge said in the order and disposed of the petition.

5,Hospital on outskirts of Quetta approved,QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo has approved the construction of a new 30-bed hospital ...,"QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo has approved the construction of a new 30-bed hospital on the outskirts of the provincial capital.
The chief minister approved the acquisition of land and funds for the construction of the hospital on the health department’s summary, which was presented to him on Saturday.
The hospital’s construction was pending for a long  time due to unavailability of land in the city. 
However, keeping in view the growing population, the health department officials said an additional 30-bed urban hospital was needed and a summary was moved to the chief minister for approval of the project and funds.

6,Lahore shooting claims life of Sikh community member,"Paramjit Singh Panjwar, 50, was shot while he was taking an early morning walk.","LAHORE: A person belonging to the Sikh community was killed by unknown assailants in a drive-by shooting in Lahore’s Nawab Town neighbourhood on Saturday, police said. 
The man, identified as Paramjit Singh Panjwar, 50, was shot by gunmen riding a motorcycle. When the attack happened, he was on a morning walk at around 6:30am, accompanied by his bodyguard near his residence in the Sunflower Housing Society, police said.
Mr Panjwar received a fatal gunshot to the head, a police official said. The bodyguard was also wounded in the attack and shifted to a local hospital, where his condition was said to be critical. The assailants fled the scene after the attack.
An official said police rushed to the site and cordoned off the area to collect evidence. The police also issued a high alert to intensify patrolling and snap-checking to round up the suspects.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
The police official said it would be premature to say anything about the motive behind Mr Panjwar’s killing and teams were working on all possible leads.
He refused to comment on reports that one of the shooters was also injured in the crossfire.
Mr Panjwar’s body was shifted to the city morgue for autopsy and police experts were trying to get access to CCTV footage of the crime scene to get more details about the suspects.
