The suspected patients — a nine-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy — had arrived at the Jinnah International Airport, Karachi, from Jeddah, a day earlier.
Pakistan has reported three cases of mpox, two in Islamabad and one in Karachi, since a national alert has been declared at airports and other entry points over the viral infection last month.
Officials state that there is no evidence of localised transmission.
According to experts, mpox cases in Pakistan, suspected or otherwise, are generally originating from Saudi Arabia because people from around the world, including parts of central and west Africa where the disease has been re-emerging in recent years, arrive for religious pilgrimage, increasing risk for infection.
Mpox, they say, has low mortality risk and more than 90 per cent of survivors have no complications. However, the viral infection is highly contagious and can spread to anyone through close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact. Even the last lesion can infect and contaminate.
According to the WHO, people can contract mpox from contaminated objects such as clothing or linens, through sharps injuries in health care, or in community setting such as tattoo parlours.

• Polling will also be held on 37 seats in 19 other districts of Sindh today
KARACHI: All arrangements have been finalised for polling in 11 union committees of Karachi on Sunday (today), where candidates belonging to the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), along with many others, are contesting the by-election on 26 local government seats.
Officials at the Election Commission of Pakistan said that a large number of polling staff on Saturday were moved to over a hundred polling stations designated for 11 UCs, which fall in Central, Korangi, West, South and Keamari districts of Karachi division. 
A total of 6,707 policemen would be deployed for security. 
With a total of 246 UCs in seven districts of Karachi, the elections were held in 235 UCs on January 15 after the polling in 11 constituencies were postponed due to deaths of candidates over the past few months. 
In district Central, the voting would be held in UC-4 and UC-13 of New Karachi and UC-6 of North Nazimabad. 
Similarly, the officials said, polling would also be held in UC-2 of Korangi, UC-3 of Shah Latif Town and UC-8 of Landhi of Korangi district. 
“In West district, polling is scheduled for UC-1 and UC-2 in Orangi Town and UC-8 of Mominabad while in districts South and Keamari, there is only one UC each, UC-2 in Bihar Colony and UC-2 in Baldia Town, where the by-elections are due on Sunday,” said an official. 
Other parts of Sindh
In other parts of Sindh, 19 districts of four divisions — Hyderabad, Sukkur, Shaheed Benazirabad and Larkana — will witness the local government elections on 37 different seats, where a large number of candidates are contesting polls from different political platforms and as well as independently. 
“There are a total of 690,295 registered voters for these by-elections of local bodies across Sindh, who will exercise their right to vote on Sunday,” said as official. 
“There are 449 polling stations across the province and none of them is being treated as normal. Some 292 polling stations among them are highly sensitive while the rest are sensitive. At all the highly sensitive polling stations, CCTV cameras have been installed for security reasons.” 
The contesting parties, their leaders and candidates are gearing up for mobilising their voters and workers even at the eleventh hour. 
The ruling PPP, marginally leading the January 15 polls, is appeared to be confident to win the majority in the by-polls. 
“The people of Karachi have posed trust in the PPP in January 15 polls and that tradition will be revived on May 7 when our candidates will emerge as victorious for development, peace and prosperity of this city,” said Sindh Labour Minister and PPP Karachi president Saeed Ghani. 
On the other hand, the Jamaat-i-Islami reiterated its claim of wining the people’s trust again in the by-polls. JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman also accused the ruling PPP of using the government machinery in all 11 UCs of Karachi to influence the electoral process and illegally help its candidates. 
“For instance, the state machinery is used against political opponents of the ruling party and in favour of the PPP in Baldia Town and other areas of the city,” the JI leader said. 
“A large number of transfers and postings have been ordered to manipulate the results,” he claimed while addressing a press conference at Idara Noor-i-Haq. 
He said that mayorship in the city was dependent upon the results of polls in the 11 union councils and urged the people of Karachi to vote and support the JI in an overwhelming manner as they did on January 15. 
The PTI also vowed that by-polls of the local bodies would be a reflection of the support party was enjoying in Karachi which made it the largest single party in 2018 general elections with 14 MNAs and over 20 MPAs. 
“We appeal voters of all these 11 UCs to come out of their homes and show their support for a true democracy, bold and honest leadership and save this city from corrupt leaders and urban feudals,” said PTI Karachi president Aftab Siddiqi.

4,SHC orders lifting of garbage from Malir riverbank,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) has directed the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) and other ...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) has directed the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) and other authorities concerned to lift garbage from the banks of the Malir river near Korangi causeway.
Over 40 residents of the adjoining areas, along with an non-governmental organisation, had petitioned the SHC in 2017 against dumping of garbage, including industrial, municipal and hospital waste and its disposal through open burning/smouldering. They had stated that it was a permanent threat for the locality and also hazardous for public health.
When a two-judge bench, headed by Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, took up the matter for hearing, a lawyer for the Cantonment Board Faisal submitted that the cantonment had neither dumped garbage at the subject area nor lifted it. However, he said the SSWMB had been authorised to lift the garbage from the locality in question.
An additional advocate general requested for a short adjournment to call a fresh report with regard to the prevailing situation in the subject areas about lifting of garbage. 
The bench directed him to file the report on the next date to be fixed after four weeks.
“In the meanwhile, the concerned authorities, including Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, are directed to ensure that the garbage shall be lifted from the subject area regularly and no one shall be allowed to put the garbage on the subject land, which creates serious hazard for the residents of the area,” the bench ruled.
The petitioners submitted that such practice was not only against their fundamental rights but also in violation of relevant environment protection laws.
They also stated that the river bank was being illegally used for dumping and burning of garbage and sought directives for respondents to immediately stop such practice as well as for legal action against them.

6,"‘All over the world, we don’t move a lot anymore’",Hannah Gaff hopes to give her students physical tools to tell stories using their bodies,"KARACHI: One of the studios at the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi, is abuzz with activity. A dozen or so acting students are avidly listening to, and following instructions of, an American movement teacher Hannah Gaff — given with a great deal of artistic flair in English translated to them into Urdu by one of their fellow pupils. 
“Give each other a high-five,” she exclaims, and a few minutes later, “Look into each other’s eyes and don’t say anything.” The young boys and girls stand still in pairs, looking at one another quietly, some with a fair degree of shyness, others concentrating hard. 
The teacher takes a 10-minute break, a gap enough for Dawn to catch up with her. An amiable person that she is, she answers all the questions with the kind of eagerness that only artists show. 

Hannah Gaff hopes to give her students physical tools to tell stories using their bodies

“I’m a physical theatre artist from the US, based mostly in San Francisco. I do a lot of international work. I have a theatre company called Uplift Physical Theatre. We make acrobatic theatre,” she says.
On the collaboration for which she is in Karachi, Ms Gaff said, “I had contacts with the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi. I’m a Fulbright specialist, so we were matched up. They wanted a specialist to teach physical theatre.”
This is her first time in Pakistan, though she does a lot of work internationally, so how has her experience been so far? “I haven’t seen a lot Pakistan yet but I have spent a lot of time here [Arts Council] and everyone’s been so kind and welcoming. I’m very impressed with the range of classes and events they have.”
Answering a question about the key things that she wants to impart to the students, Ms Gaff said, “They already have three years of acting training. The part that I’m hoping to bring is to give them physical tools to find characters and tell stories using their bodies. We’ll be doing theatre, physical clowning, acrobatic theatre, images etc… different ways.”
The students at the end of the training session will show some of the work that they will have learnt.
When asked, since her focus is on movement, whether South Asians have a different body type, the theatre practitioner said, “I don’t think so. People have bodies everywhere and they’re all the same. Somehow we’re uniquely different. I think all over the world we don’t move a lot anymore. We’ve stopped moving… We spend less of our time being physical or outside and more time on our computers and devices. I think we’re more challenged than we used to be.”

KARACHI: A large number of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and supporters took out a rally on main Sharea Faisal and marched on the Numaish intersection on Saturday as a part of the nationwide call from their chairman Imran Khan to show solidarity with the Supreme Court.
Riding on motorbikes, cars, vans, buses, trucks and different modes of transport, the charged participants were carrying placards and PTI flags and dancing to the tunes of party songs while moving to the rally destination.
After converging on main Numaish intersection near Mazar-i-Quaid, the leaders of the party in their addresses vowed to continue their struggle and give sacrifice for the dignity, regard and supremacy of the apex court. They blamed “imported government” for deliberately undermining the respect of Supreme Court and its judges for the vested political interests and desired judgments.
“But the people of Pakistan have never allowed anyone to attack the judiciary and its judges, and they will resist against such moves again,” said PTI Karachi president Aftab Siddiqi while addressing the rally. 
“Pakistan is united under Imran Khan and that day isn’t very far when the beloved and the most popular leader of the Pakistan’s history would come into power through vote and by the will of the people. That day would restore respect and dignity of our judiciary.”
The general secretary of the party’s Karachi chapter, Arsalan Taj Ghumman, said that Karachi proved again that it only wanted Imran Khan as the prime minister of Pakistan as whenever a call is given by the party chairman, the people of the metropolis respond with zeal and passion.
“This is the reason which prevents this corrupt government from calling general elections, to stop Imran Khan from becoming the prime minister. For their evil objectives, they are now finally targeting the Supreme Court to bring down the justice system for once and all,” he added.

9,‘Karl Marx is still relevant in our society’,"KARACHI: Social science experts, trade unionists and workers gathered to remember Karl Marx during a seminar titled...","KARACHI: Social science experts, trade unionists and workers gathered to remember Karl Marx during a seminar titled ‘Dialogue with youth on Marx and his works’, organised by Alternate, a youth organisation, in collaboration with the National Trade Union Federation (NTUF) and Home Based Women Workers Federation (HBWWF) at the Arts Council. 
The speakers concluded that the fast changing mode of production has created a new working class that has resulted in a new socio-economic matrix which was not present in Karl Marx’s time.
SZABIST Dean of Social Sciences Dr Riaz Shaikh said Marx believed that the mode of relations in a feudal system were somewhat flexible, though they became rigid in the capitalist mode of economy. 
“Change in the mode of production changed the way of exploitation of the working classes,” he said. 
“Following the creation of a unipolar world, the theory of alienation of Marx is now being understood in a new light. In this new period, trade unions weakened and a new class of urban people named modern conservatives was born. Meanwhile, ultranationalist movement got new strength instead of globalism. Instead of doing politics on basic ideological issues, petty issues such as roads and civic infrastructure got central place in the political arena,” Dr Shaikh added. 
Noted scholar Dr Syed Jaffar Ahmed delivered the keynote address. He said that Karl Marx should be read under a methodology of the development of his own thought to see how his ideas changed and developed with the course of time. 
“The fall of the Soviet Union was not the fall of an ideology, but the  fall of a state that invested more in defence than social sector to  cater the basic needs of its citizens. Karl Marx is still relevant in  our society and our political workers, thinkers and intellectuals should  read his works,” he said.
“Marx is accused of sacrificing individuality of the man for the cause of collectivity, but they forget that the centre of the ideology of Marx is the relation of a person with his society,” he said.
“In order to understand this relation, Marx sought help from history. He came to the conclusion that the class-based system is the main barrier in the creative production process of a person,” he said, adding that Marx was of the view that the production mode and its relationships shape the other aspects of a society. 
“Many predictions of Marx could not prove true about changes in Europe and India, but his debate was scientific and based on information and knowledge available to him at that time,” he said.

11,"Judge summons Jacobabad civil surgeon, two hospitals’ heads over public woes","Patients complain of doctors’ absence, denial of available medicines and lack of essential facilities.","LARKANA: The Jacobabad district and sessions judge on Friday summoned civil surgeon of Jacobabad Civil Hospital and medical superintendents of taluka hospitals, Thull and Garhi Khairo, to court on May 15 and directed them to submit report on the absence of doctors and paramedical staff, lack of facilities and the hospitals’ refusal to provide quality drugs to patients.  
The judge Abdul Ghafoor Kalhoro issued notices to the health officers after he learnt that poor patients were not being provided multinational companies’ drugs despite availability of the same at the hospitals’ stores. 
He said that most of the doctors and paramedics remained absent from their duties at Thull and Garhi Khairo taluka hospitals. There was no woman medical officer at the hospitals to handle gynecological issues of women, he said in the letters.  
In a letter addressed to the MS of Garhi Khairo taluka hospital, the judge impressed upon the MS that it was his duty to ensure provision of medical facilities to patients regardless of their social and financial status. 

Patients complain of doctors’ absence, denial of available medicines and lack of essential facilities

He said in another letter to the civil surgeon of Jacobabad Civil Hospital that patients were not only denied multinational companies’ medicines but also X-ray and other costly tests as the machines installed at the hospital were found out of order.  
The court asked the civil surgeon and MS’s of the two taluka hospitals to appear in person along with a detailed report on provision of medicines, punctuality of doctors and health of equipments installed at their facilities on May15. Failure to appear and submit report on the fixed date would result in legal action, he warned. 
Administrator, mukhtiarkar and CMO also summoned 
The judge, who is also chairperson of criminal coordination committee, asked in another letter to chief municipal officer, administrator and mukhtiarkar of Jacobabad to appear in court on May 27 and inform the court about the state of supply of drinking water to people through Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant and legal status of the piece of where the RO plant had installed.  
It was brought into the notice of the court that the plot in question near Juria Chowk had been encroached upon by land-grabbers, who had stopped supply of drinking water to citizens through the RO plant constructed with millions of rupees. The plot was a public property, said the letter. 
In the letter to the chief municipal officer, the judge said: “It is your responsibility and duty to ensure the plant’s protection, preservation as well as smooth supply of sweet drinking water regularly to citizens of Jacobabad”.  
The court would specifically want to know if any action had been taken against the encroachers and the steps had been taken to supply sweet drinking water to citizens through the RO plant, said the letter.  
The judge summoned mukhtiarkar (revenue) of Jacobabad taluka to the court and directed him to produce record in his possession so as to determine legal status of the plot of water supply and RO plant.
