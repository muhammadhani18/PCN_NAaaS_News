0,Being captain of World Cup winners will be sweet: Babar,Says he wants to lead Pakistan to World Cup glory.,"KARACHI: Batting sensation Babar Azam is currently enjoying a purple patch with the willow while his team reached the top of ODI cricket rankings the other day.
The 28-year-old skipper, who is going to play his 100th One-day International here at the National Bank Stadium on Sunday when Pakistan face New Zealand in the fifth and final ODI, is now eyeing the biggest prize — the World Cup — as his next goal.
He is plain in his desire, and wants to lead Pakistan to World Cup glory.
“Being the captain of a World Cup-winning side would be sweet,” Babar said while speaking to PCB Digital.
 






Pakistan, after reaching the top ODI team ranking during the fourth ODI victory against New Zealand in Karachi on Friday, can hope to do well at this year’s 50-over World Cup being staged in India during October-November.
Babar reflected on his journey and eight-year international career thus far, recalling several career highlights including the first time he was called upon to the team.
“It was a different feeling altogether,” Babar said.
“There was some talk about me being selected, but when I got the call, there was a lot of excitement. I was sitting with my family and it made them happy.
“When I entered the Gaddafi Stadium as a Pakistan player, I reminisced my journey of how I used to come here as a ball picker and how I had come here before Inzamam-ul-Haq’s final Test, which was against South Africa, as a net bowler,” Babar recalled.
 






The Pakistan skipper also recalled how he wasn’t picked to the national academy for top performers after his first season as an under-15 regional player and the many sacrifices he made on the road to becoming an international cricketer.
Once in the national team, Babar had a good start to his career but struggled to convert starts to big knocks. He recalled the role of former head coach, and now team director, Mickey Arthur in him turning around this trend with three centuries on the trot against West Indies in 2016 in the UAE.
“I want to mention Mickey as he played an integral role in my transformation,” Babar said.
“As a cricketer, there’s a feeling that if you are not up to the mark, you might get dropped from the side, but he gave me the confidence.
“He asked me to give my best to the side and not worry about getting axed from the side and that helped me a great deal. He did not only do it with me but with every player in the side and that is why we have eight to nine players in the side currently from that lot.”
In 2019, Babar was elevated to captaincy, and his numbers took an instant spike as he enjoyed the additional responsibility. In ODIs, he averages over 75 as captain (after the fourth ODI against New Zealand) and has seven tons in 25 matches.
All three of his T20 Internationals tons also came as skipper of the side. In Tests, the difference was profound with his average going over 50 as captain.
“The first year was a little overwhelming as there were a lot of things to deal with simultaneously as a Pakistan captain,” Babar spoke of taking on captaincy.
“But, I learned how to manage that. I also learned a lot from how Saifi bhai [Sarfaraz Ahmed] managed the team. I used to see his demeanour on and off the field and used to ask him questions that helped me.
“The most crucial bit in leading a team is to provide clarity to each and every player and have honest and open communication with the players. This breeds positivity in the team environment and brings everyone together as a team.
“As a captain, you have a kind of a dual responsibility because as a non-captain, you only focus on your field and batting, but now you also have to run a team. I enjoy taking responsibility and it brings the best out of me.”
Meanwhile, fast bowler Matt Henry hopes New Zealand can avoid a series whitewash in Pakistan by producing an improved display in the fifth ODI.
New Zealand landed in Pakistan without regular skipper Kane Williamson, who is likely to miss the World Cup with a knee injury, while several frontline players are busy honouring franchise commitments in the Indian Premier League.
The team under Tom Latham managed to draw the preceding T20 series 2-2 but Pakistan have taken an unassailable 4-0 lead in the one-day series.
In the fourth ODI, skipper Babar smashed 107 to help Pakistan post a commanding 334-6. In reply, New Zealand were all out for 232 in the 44th over to succumb to a 102-run defeat.
“It’s a shame we really haven’t had the success that we wanted to … “ Henry told reporters after the loss.
“Even though it’s not nice not to have won, we’re definitely taking some positives out of this tour so far.
“We’ve still got one game to go and hopefully we can put that performance together.”

1,Mehran shines as Shaheens hammer Zimbabwe ‘A’,KWEKWE: Pakistan Shaheens secured a comfortable eight-wicket victory over Zimbabwe ‘A’ in the first four-day...,"KWEKWE: Pakistan Shaheens secured a comfortable eight-wicket victory over Zimbabwe ‘A’ in the first four-day match at Kwekwe Sports Club on  Saturday. The match was dominated by Pakistani spinner Mehran Mumtaz, who took a total of 11 wickets across both innings to help his side to victory.
After Zimbabwe ‘A’ was dismissed for 189 in their first innings, Pakistan Shaheens posted a commanding 428 thanks to a double century by Omair Bin Yousuf.
In their second innings, Zimbabwe ‘A’ fought back with a century from Joylord Gumbie, but Mehran’s six-wicket haul ensured the hosts were all out for 296, setting Pakistan a target of 106 to win.
Opening batsmen Imran Butt and Omair started the chase in style, putting on a quickfire 65-run partnership in just 9.4 overs before Omair was dismissed for 33. Kamran Ghulam came and went cheaply, but Imran continued his assault on the Zimbabwean bowlers, finishing unbeaten on 62 off just 54 deliveries.
Hussain Talat joined Imran at the crease and together they scored the remaining runs needed for victory, with Hussain hitting a six to seal the win in the 19th over.
It was a clinical performance from Pakistan Shaheens, who will be hoping to continue their winning form in the second four-day match at the Mutare Sports Club from 10 May.
Scores in brief:
PAKISTAN SHAHEENS 521-3 decl in 115.3 overs (Omair Bin Yousuf 250 not out, Mohammad Huraira 178, Hussain Talat 51 not out) and 111-2 in 18.2 overs (Imran Butt 62 not out, Omair Bin Yousuf 33)
ZIMBABWE ‘A’ 225 in 76.3 overs (Dion Myers 56, Roy Kaia 47; Mehran Mumtaz 5-47, Mohammad Ali 2-56) and 401 in 104.4 overs (Joylord Gumbie 115, Tanaka Chivanga 58, Tanunurwa Makoni 57, Faraz Akram 48, Brandon Mavuta 41; Mehran Mumtaz 6-110, Mir Hamza 2-64, Mohammad Ali 2-98).

3,SAFF announces start of club championship from next year,Pakistan delegates miss Congress,"KARACHI: The South Asian Football Federation took some major decisions on Saturday, announcing the start of the club championship while electing the region’s representative at the Asian Football Confederation, but no delegates from Pakistan were present in-person as its Congress met in Dhaka.
The club championship, a long-cherished dream of SAFF president Kazi Salahuddin, will begin from next year, it was disclosed at the news conference following the Congress meeting which saw All India Football Federation secretary Dr Shaji Prabhakaran elected as the AFC executive committee member.
Since becoming SAFF president in 2009, Kazi had been looking at launching the club competition but its inception was delayed since there had been little interest from sponsors. But he told reporters in Dhaka that the “SAFF executive committee has decided in principle to hold the championship from next year”.
“My dream was to get this started,” said Salahuddin. “It will start from the middle of next year on a home and away basis. The details of it will be chalked out following research and discussions among the member associations.”

Pakistan delegates miss Congress

The new development is that the championship will be on a home-and-away basis after Dhaka was last year touted as the venue for the inaugural edition this year. Now, it is set for a 2024 start.
SAFF had announced last year that Pakistan Premier Football League side Wapda would be Pakistan’s representatives in the first edition. The format disclosed had one side each from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan and two teams each from India, Bangladesh and the Maldives.
Prabhakaran’s election to the AFC executive committee comes a year after he was appointed AIFF secretary.
“I would like to express my thanks and gratitude to members of the SAFF and AIFF for giving me this honour by electing me to the AFC Executive Committee,” he said in a statement.
“It is an honour for me to represent SAFF in the AFC Executive Committee, and I will try to play my part being a member for the continuous development of football in Asia by working closely with the AFC president and his team.”
India is set to host the SAFF Championship, the showpiece tournament for the region’s national teams, in Bangalore from the end of June. With Sri Lanka suspended by FIFA, Kuwait have joined as the seventh team. Another team will be invited to make it an eight-team tournament.
VISAS DENIED
Two members of the Pakistan Football Federation Normalisation Committee, Shahid Khokhar and Saud Hashmi, were due to travel to Dhaka for the Congress but couldn’t do so after they were denied visas by the Bangladesh authorities.
The duo attended the Congress virtually and Khokhar said that the non-issuance of visas to the Pakistan delegation was damaging to football in the region.
“It is hurting the beautiful game,” he told Dawn in a statement. “Football brotherhood and development of the game must not suffer due to such hurdles. I would not reiterate the importance of the subject matter in the context of people to people contact and relationships, but as a football promoter I must say that it is not in the favour of the spirit of the game.”
He stated that there is a huge collective potential to be explored if Pakistan, India and Bangladesh are on the same page and added that he feared that “if participation of SAFF members in events remains difficult, there will be demands to shift events [like these] to neutral venues.”
Neither Salahuddin nor SAFF general secretary Anwarul Haque Helal responded to queries by Dawn on why visas weren’t issued to the Pakistan delegates.
Khokhar, however, was hopeful that Pakistan’s national team will receive visas to travel to India for the SAFF Championship, which runs from June 21 to July 4.
“The AIFF secretary has assured us multiple times that he will make his best efforts in this regard,” he said, adding that he felt that the SAFF club championship will be a “game-changer for football in the region.”

According to a press release issued by the PBF, the decision was taken at an executive committee meeting held in Lahore on Saturday.

Russian, Belarusian golfers allowed to return as neutrals
LAUSANNE: The International Golf Federation (IGF) has said Russian and Belarusian athletes can return to competing in international competitions as neutrals.
The IOC sanctioned Russia and its ally Belarus after Moscow invaded Ukraine in Feb 2022 but in March recommended that their athletes be allowed to return to international competition as neutrals.
Table tennis, pentathlon, fencing, judo and taekwondo are among the Olympic sports to have readmitted athletes from the two countries.
“... the IOC has not made a decision regarding the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the 2024 Paris Olympics, and as such the IGF board has deferred any decision on their participation at the Olympic golf competitions,” the IGF said.—Reuters

In Sunday’s title clash, the top-seeded Spaniard will face off against lucky loser Jan-Lennard Struff who battled from a set down to beat qualifier Aslan Karatsev 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the other semi-final.
Alcaraz has enjoyed a spectacular start to his career, becoming the youngest man to top the world rankings after his US Open win last September and has already claimed three Masters 1000 titles as a teenager.
He took a big step towards another Masters crown and stamped his credentials as one of the favourites for this month’s French Open on a warm afternoon at the Manolo Santana Stadium with six-times Roland Garros champion Bjorn Borg watching on.
World number two Alcaraz heaped the pressure on Coric in their first career meeting and faced stiff resistance from the Croatian 17th seed before drawing first blood with a searing forehand in the fifth game of a physical opening set.
After wrapping up the first set, Alcaraz grabbed an early break and despite a wobble on his own serve, raced to a 4-2 lead in the next as he dictated terms against a fading Coric. He swiftly closed out his 28th win in 30 matches this year.
Struff lost to Russia’s Karatsev 10 days ago in the final round of qualifying but was added to the main draw after a late withdrawal. He has since enjoyed a fine run, ousting world number five Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-final.

Cracks Man’s last success came on March 19 and he failed to maintain the form in the following two runs and was among those who also ran.
He is drawn alongside half-a-dozen contenders in the race under scale order II, III, IV and V being run over four furlongs. It is the last race of a four-race card. The other three races will also run over the same distance.
Cracks Man is expected to be challenged by bay horse Golden Step while another bay horse Azeem Choice, if on job, can lower the colours of Cracks Man.  
At the outset, gelding Faisal Choice looks a better choice to dominate the opening race by overcoming victory jinx.
He is likely to be opposed by bay horse Canadian King under scale order VIII race which also has seven acceptors.
Bay horse Thakur, who is yet to open his account, can bring an element of surprise.
Bay horse Faisal King, stable-mate of Faisal Choice, looks poised to return with flying colours in the next race also classified under scale order VIII.
With a win under her belt, mare Baby Champion is expected to pose a serious threat to Faisal King in the race which has a field of seven horses.
Mare Basanti, who has failed to finish on the board in her last five runs, may pull off an upset.
Grey horse Flag Of Champion may excel in the third and supporting race under scale order V, VI and VII.
The horse could not make it to the race last week as he was scratched in the morning declaration for being unfit.
He may be chased by bay horse Epsom to attain second place on board.
The first race starts at 1:00pm.

9,Verstappen top as Leclerc crashes in Miami GP practice,MIAMI: Red Bull’s championship leader Max Verstappen was comfortably fastest while Charles Leclerc crashed his...,"MIAMI: Red Bull’s championship leader Max Verstappen was comfortably fastest while Charles Leclerc crashed his Ferrari into the barriers in second practice for the Miami Formula One Grand Prix on Friday.
Leclerc went off at turn eight, the car snapping and locking up as it went nose first into the barriers and wrecked the front suspension.
The incident brought out the red flags with 10 minutes remaining, the Monegasque stepping out and walking away with his session over.
Verstappen had already made it business as usual at the top with a 1:27.930 effort on an improving track after George Russell had led seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton in a Mercedes one-two in the first session.
“I think it was a good day,” said the Dutch double world champion, whose team have won all four races so far this season with three one-twos.
Red Bull’s Mexican Sergio Perez, second in the championship and six points adrift of Verstappen, was fourth and nearly half a second slower.
Russell’s best time of one minute 30.125 seconds came after the Briton experienced steering issues that cost him some time in a hot and steamy session.
A team spokesperson said the Briton was using a test item that proved too heavy so they changed the steering rack back to the old one.
“Part of the reason we’re up there is we were the last car on track doing new tyres and they got clean laps,” said Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin.
“But we’ve had races this year where no matter what we did we could never get up near the top of the timesheets. So I think it’s encouraging but one to keep in perspective.”
Russell was 15th in the second session and Hamilton seventh.
Leclerc was third fastest in both sessions while team-mate Carlos Sainz was second in practice two, 0.385 slower than Verstappen.
Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso ended up fifth on the 3.36 mile (5.41km) temporary street circuit around Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins, with McLaren’s Lando Norris sixth.
Verstappen, the winner of the inaugural Miami Grand Prix last year, was nearly a half-second off the pace in the first session.
Perez, six points behind and a double winner last weekend in Azerbaijan with the first sprint of the season, was well down the timing sheets in 11th in that opening practice.
Haas’s Nico Hulkenberg spun and slammed into the wall, bringing out the red flags in that session.
Until then Hulkenberg had been enjoying a lively practice for the US-owned outfit, sitting second behind Verstappen when the session was paused.
Logan Sargeant, the only American on the starting grid who grew up in nearby Fort Lauderdale, could not give the fans much to cheer. The Williams rookie finished 19th and 20th respectively.

10,"City close in on Premier League coronation, Chelsea end losing streak",Tottenham's Harry Kane moves to second place in Premier League’s all-time scoring list.,"LONDON: Manchester City moved a step closer to the Premier League title with a 2-1 win against Leeds United on Saturday as Chelsea finally won for the first time under caretaker boss Frank Lampard.
Just hours after the pomp and ceremony of the coronation of King Charles III in London’s Westminster Abbey, City underlined their desire to extend their own reign as they chase a fifth Premier League title in six seasons.
Ilkay Gundogan scored City’s goals in the first half, before missing a late penalty that set up a tense finale when Rodrigo got one back for Leeds.
City held on to climb four points clear of second placed Arsenal.
In tribute to the King, the national anthem was played before kick-off at all four afternoon Premier League games.
But it is Pep Guardiola who lords it over the Premier League and the City boss is on the brink of a leading his team to a third successive title.
Arsenal can close the gap on City to one point if they win their tricky trip to third placed Newcastle United on Sunday.
However, Guardiola’s men will have a game in hand on Arsenal after that fixture and need three wins from their last four matches to be certain of retaining the title.
Relentless City have won their last 10 league games and are unbeaten in 20 matches in all competitions.
“We played an exceptional game. We were maybe not as clinical as we should be. But we cannot forget it is three games in six days with a lot of mental pressure,” Guardiola said.
Defeat in Sam Allardyce’s first match in charge left Leeds one place above the relegation zone on goal difference.
With Tuesday’s Champions League semi-final first leg at Real Madrid on Tuesday in mind, Guardiola made seven changes to his starting line-up.
City went ahead in the 19th minute after pinning Leeds deep inside their own half in a blistering start.
Riyad Mahrez was the catalyst with an incisive pass that picked out Gundogan and the German midfielder netted with a fine low finish from just inside the penalty area.
The same pair were at the heart of City’s second goal eight minutes later.
Mahrez cut his pass back to Gundogan, who took a touch before sweeping a clinical strike into the far corner from 20 yards.
After Gundogan hit the post with a penalty awarded for Pascal Struijk’s foul on Phil Foden, Guardiola was furious that Erling Haaland did not take the spot-kick.
Guardiola’s angst grew when Rodrigo punished a mistake from Manuel Akanji to slot home in the 85th minute, but Leeds couldn’t complete the comeback.
“If it is 4-0 with 10 minutes left, OK. But at 2-0? Erling is the best penalty taker right now so he has to take it. This is a business, not a situation where we cannot forget it,” Guardiola said.
Meanwhile, Chelsea won for first time in Lampard’s second spell in charge, beating Bournemouth 3-1 to end a six-match losing streak.
Conor Gallagher headed Chelsea into a ninth minute lead, diverting N’Golo Kante’s cross beyond Neto.
Matias Vina equalised with a 21st minute curler, but Benoit Badiashile volleyed in Hakim Ziyech’s free-kick for his first Chelsea goal in the 82nd minute.
Joao Felix’s 86th-minute strike wrapped up Chelsea’s first victory in 10 matches in all competitions.
Chelsea are up to 11thbut are still in danger of finishing in the bottom half of the 20-team table for the first time since 1996.
In the nights other game, Harry Kane moved into second place in the Premier League’s all-time scoring list as his goal sealed a 1-0 win against Crystal Palace.
The England captain broke the deadlock in first half stoppage-time with a powerful header from Pedro Porro’s cross.Sixth placed Tottenham are six points adrift of the top four after winning for the first time in five games.
Elsewhere, Toti Gomes’ first goal for Wolves — a ninth minute header from Ruben Neves’ corner — sealed a 1-0 win against Aston Villa.

11,Torch relay for 34th National Games starts in Karachi,"The torch will now head to Peshawar from where it is scheduled to travel to Islamabad, Azad Jammu Kashmir and Lahore before going to Quetta.","KARACHI: The launch of the nationwide torch relay for the 34th National Games made a sunny day even brighter here at the mausoleum of Quaid-i-Azam on Saturday. This tradition was started by none other than Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, way back in March 1948, and it continues to this day.
The relay, which started at the mausoleum in a simple ceremony, went to Iqra University (Main Campus), where Sindh Minister of Information, Labour and Human Resources Saeed Ghani inaugurated the event.
The torch’s final stopover in the metropolitan city was the Sir Syed University. It will head to Peshawar from where it is scheduled to travel to Islamabad, Azad Jammu Kashmir and Lahore before going to Quetta, which is hosting the national gala for the first time in 19 years from May 15 to 23.
Over 6,500 national and international athletes are set to compete in 32 games, with 450 contestants from Karachi alone.
A number of dignitaries attended the ceremony of Karachi torch relay at the mausoleum, including Sindh Chief Secretary Sohail Rajput, who emphasised promoting sports in the country through commercial investments.
Following his official address at the event, Sohail presented the torch to Islahuddin Siddiqui, the winning captain of the 1978 hockey World Cup, who then handed it over to the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics gold medallist Nasir Ali.
Chief Minister’s spokesman Babar Yousafzai declared that the Games would demonstrate that Balochistan is a completely safe place.
“We are a loving nation. I assure you that Balochistan, while keeping its customs and traditions, will host the event to the best of its ability,” he said.
The theme of the National Games is ‘harmony, peace and faith’, and the aim is to utilise the abilities of Pakistan’s young population in positive ways.
Olympian and Pakistan’s top female badminton player, Mahoor Shahzad, commended the occasion, saying the National Games provide a good platform for athletes to enhance their skills.
“It [National Games] is Pakistan’s biggest sporting event enabling the participants to produce a higher level of competition,” Mahoor, who counts Chinese Tai Tzu-ying as her inspiration, told Dawn.
Speaking on the occasion, Mahoor, currently ranked 117th in the world, underscored that there is dearth of international-standard badminton academies and coaches in Pakistan, which hinders the growth of sports. “I am pushing for the top-100 but it is not an easy feat.”
Highlighting the significance of sports, Saeed underlined the importance of providing more and more playing opportunities for athletes to polish their skills. He urged the youth to participate in sports and showcase their abilities on national and international levels.
The National Games, which are being held after four years, will feature 32 disciplines, including archery, athletics, badminton, boxing, football, golf, hockey, judo, karate, shooting, squash, swimming, table tennis, taekwondo, tennis, volleyball, weightlifting, wrestling, and fencing. Additionally, four exhibition sports, including futsal, throwball, canoe and kayak, and cricket for women, will also be staged during the national sports gala.

12,Cologne end Leverkusen’s unbeaten run,LEVERKUSEN: Bayer Leverkusen slumped to a 2-1 home loss to Cologne on Friday to end their 14-game unbeaten run ...,"LEVERKUSEN: Bayer Leverkusen slumped to a 2-1 home loss to Cologne on Friday to end their 14-game unbeaten run across all competitions and put their European spot in danger with three Bundesliga matches remaining.
Cologne’s Davie Selke struck twice in the first half -- either side of Amine Adli’s equaliser -- to give them their third straight away win, their longest winning run away from home in 31 years.
It was not the dress rehearsal that Xabi Alonso’s Leverkusen team had been hoping for ahead of next week’s Europa League semi-final first leg against AS Roma.
They are on 48 points in sixth place, which would be good enough to secure a spot in next season’s Europa Conference League, two ahead of Mainz 05 and VfL Wolfsburg, who face Borussia Dortmund on Sunday.
Selke stunned the hosts in the 14th minute, easily beating defender Jonathan Tah to head in and give Cologne the lead with their first chance of the game.
Leverkusen levelled with a perfectly executed counter attack that ended with Adli slotting in.
The hosts were in full control of the game when Cologne struck again as Selke stabbed in his second goal of the evening in the 36th minute against the run of play.
Meanwhile, Schalke recorded a 3-2 victory at Mainz with the deciding goal coming through a last-minute penalty from Marius Bulter in the stoppage time.
The victory lifted Schalke outside the relegation zone for now, albeit having played one more game than their rivals.
Bulter and Tom Krauss twice put Schalke ahead only for Leandro Barreiro and Aaron Caricol to equalise but a penalty 12 minutes into stoppage time converted by Bulter earned the visitors a priceless three points.

13,Richardson wins 100m in Doha Diamond League,DOHA: Sha’Carri Richardson left her rivals in the dust as the American streaked to 100 metres victory in the first...,"DOHA: Sha’Carri Richardson left her rivals in the dust as the American streaked to 100 metres victory in the first Diamond League meeting of the season in Doha on Friday.
Richardson, who was expected to be one of the biggest draws at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 before she accepted a one-month ban after testing positive for cannabis, set a meet record in Doha with a time of 10.76 seconds.
The 23-year-old beat Jamaica’s world 200-metre champion Shericka Jackson (10.85) while Briton Dina Asher-Smith was third (10.98) in a field that featured five Americans on the start line.
“I’m so blessed and thankful, I feel at peace. All I do is the best I do and I’m excited to do it,” Richardson said.
“Like I said it before, I had to be kicked out from another 100-metre race, so I had to do my best no matter what. Peace, love and life.”  Asher Smith, who won the world 200-metre title in Doha in 2019, said she was happy with her third-placed finish.
“The whole point about my season is to race against the best and I did that tonight. I am really happy with my race, third place is a good start and the time is decent,” she said.
In the men’s 200 metres, American Fred Kerley stormed to victory in lane seven, clocking 19.92 seconds, using his long strides to his advantage in the final 40 metres.
The American, who won the silver in the 100 metres at the Tokyo Olympics, reeled in compatriot and Tokyo 200-metre silver medallist Kenneth Bednarek (20.11) who finished second while Canadian Aaron Brown (20.20) was third.
“I was comfortable, but I know I still got work to do. The most important was to win and I did,” Kerley said. “I was happy with the competition, it was a good one, the guys gave me a fight. Next is Japan, (I will) open up my season in the 100 [metres].”
Fellow Canadian and reigning Olympic champion Andre De Grasse was in lane eight and could only manage a sixth-placed finish despite a season best time.
India’s Neeraj Chopra and Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon, reigning Olympic champions in the men’s javelin and women’s 1,500 metres, began their Diamond League title defences with wins in their respective events.
With several Indian fans in attendance, Chopra set the tone for the competition with his very first attempt even though he showed disappointment with his throw, a world-leading 88.67 metres. The Czech Republic’s Jakub Vadlejch, who won silver in Tokyo, finished second again — four centimetres shy of Chopra’s mark.
The pair were the only two athletes to breach the 88 metres-mark with Grenada’s Anderson Peters third (85.88).
In the final event of the night, Kipyegon became the fifth athlete to set a world-leading mark when she finished the 1,500 metres in 3:58.57 to beat the Ethiopian duo of Diribe Welteji, who finished less than a second behind, and Freweyni Hailu.
