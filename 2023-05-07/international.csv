0,25-year jail term for Oath Keepers founder sought,WASHINGTON: The US Justice Department asked a federal judge on Friday to sentence Oath Keepers founder Stewart ...,"WASHINGTON: The US Justice Department asked a federal judge on Friday to sentence Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes to 25 years in prison for his conviction on seditious conspiracy and other charges over the 2021 attack on the US Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump.
The Justice Department is also seeking a sentence of 21 years for another Oath Keepers leader, Kelly Meggs, who was also found guilty in November of seditious conspiracy by a Washington, DC, jury.
Rhodes and Meggs are among 10 members of far-right groups found guilty of seditious conspiracy — a plot to oppose the government with force — for their roles in the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, which was an attempt to overturn Democratic President Joe Biden’s 2020 election win.
If fully imposed, the recommended sentences would be the longest so far for anyone convicted in connection with the Capitol riot. Prosecutors said the defendants  “played a central and damning role” in the attack and should be sentenced more severely than other rioters because their conduct was comparable to domestic terrorism.
Earlier on Friday, Peter Schwartz, a Pennsylvania man with a lengthy criminal history, was sentenced to more than 14 years in prison for storming the Capitol, the longest prison term handed down so far.

2,UN chief urges armed groups in DRC to lay down arms,BUJUMBURA: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Saturday urged all armed groups in eastern Democratic Republic ...,"BUJUMBURA: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Saturday urged all armed groups in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo to lay down their weapons, saying their presence was causing  “humanitarian tragedies” and threatening regional security.
Guterres was speaking at a meeting of regional leaders in Bujumbura, the commercial capital of Burundi, convened to discuss the security situation in Congo where armed groups have been blamed for violence and mass displacement of civilians.
Eastern Congo has for years been plagued by widespread violence that has included killings, rapes and mutilations by armed insurgents from various groups including M23 and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).
“The presence of these armed groups...leads to humanitarian tragedies and serious human rights abuses, including sexual violence,” Guterres said, adding there were over 100 armed groups in eastern Congo and that their presence was threatening regional security.
“It is time for the violence to end. I reiterate my call to all armed groups (to) lay down your arms immediately and join the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration process.”  A resurgence of the M23 since November 2021 has displaced at least 500,000 people, Guterres said.
Congo accuses neighbouring Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebels, which are made up of mostly Tutsi ethnic group members from Congo’s east.
Rwanda denies the accusation and accuses Congo of persecuting its Tutsi population and fanning ethnic hatred against them.
Guterres also called on political leaders  “to end hate speech and incitement to violence.”

3,Ukraine downs hypersonic Russian missile in ‘historic first’,Ukrainian Air Force says missile had been taken down by a US Patriot air defence system.,"KYIV: Ukrainian air defences shot down a Russian hypersonic missile for the first time during an attack on the capital Kyiv this week, the Air Force said on Saturday, in a potentially major setback for the Kremlin’s campaign of long-range air strikes.
The Kinzhal, which means  “dagger” in Rus­si­an, is one of six  “next generation” weapons unveiled by President Vladimir Putin in 2018 when the Russian leader boasted that it cannot be shot down by any of the world’s air defence systems.
Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Olesh­chuk said the Kh-47 Kinzhal had been shot down on Thursday night over the region outside Kyiv. The Air Force said it had been taken down by a US Patriot air defence system.
“I congratulate the Ukrainian people on the historic event. Yes, we shot down the ‘unparalleled’ Kinzhal,” he said on the Telegram app.
The US Patriot system is one of an array of sophisticated air defence units supplied by the West to help Ukraine repel a months-long Russian campaign of air strikes that has targeted critical infrastructure, power facilities and other sites.
Hundreds of civilians have been killed in the attacks that Russia stepped up in October ahead of winter. The strikes failed to cripple the power grid but caused sweeping power cuts and other outages. Russia denies targeting civilians.
Russia, which did not immediately comment on Ukraine’s statement about the Kinzhal, has in the past boasted that the missile has no equivalent in the West.
The air-launched ballistic missile, which can reach speeds of up to Mach 10 (12,350 kilometres per hour), is capable of carrying nuclear or conventional warheads. It has a reported range of 1,500 to 2,000km.
Ukraine said the missile was fired during a drone attack on Kyiv and other cities in the early hours of Thursday.
The Air Force had not previously disclosed that a Kinzhal was used for the attack, although Kyiv officials said immediately that a ballistic missile had been involved.
The Thursday air strike came less than a day after Russia accused Ukraine of a failed attempt to assassinate President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack on the Kremlin citadel in Moscow and threatened to retaliate. Moscow has since accused Washington of involvement in allegations denied by both Ukraine and the United States.
Russia has already intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian regions over the past week as Kyiv prepares to launch a counter-offensive against Russian forces who have dug in across swathes of occupied land in the south and east.
US Patriot missiles were only delivered to Ukraine last month, officials said.
Kinzhal missiles have been used on several occasions in Ukraine. The first known use of the weapon in combat was when Russia said it had fired the missile at a munitions dump in southwestern Ukraine on March 19, 2022.
Ukraine’s Air Force was previously seen as unable to shoot down ballistic missiles, which Russia used to strike residential areas and Ukraine’s power infrastructure.
The Air Force on Satur­day said it shot down eight Shahed drones launched by Russia on the eastern and south-east Ukrainian regions in an overnight attack.

4,Israelis protest against judicial reforms for 18th week,Protesters say Netanyahu govt waiting to turn Israel into a “messianic and dangerous dictatorship”.,"TEL AVIV: Thousands of Israelis protested for an 18th straight week against the hard-right government’s controversial judicial reforms, despite Prime Minister Benjamin Netan­yahu shelving the overhaul more than a month ago.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the central city of Rehovot, waving Israeli flags and blocking a major road junction.
Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv’s Habima Square as they prepared to march across the city to Kaplan Street waving Israeli flags and chanting anti-Netanyahu slogans.
One protester held aloft a large picture of far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir with a caption dubbing him  “the minister of national failure”. Israeli police did not immediately release any estimates for the number of demonstrators.
In a statement released earlier, protest organisers said the Netanyahu government was waiting to turn Israel into a  “messianic and dangerous dictatorship”.
They underlined what they said was the economic cost of the government’s refusal to ditch the reforms altogether, inste­ad holding talks with opposition representatives hosted by President Isaac Herzog for the past month.
“As long as the deliberations in the president’s house continue, no investment is entering Israel and the Israeli economy is cra­shing,” the organisers said.
Proponents of the judicial reforms claim they are necessary to rebalance power between the branches of government. Critics say they represent a threat to democracy.
Netanyahu announced a  “pause” in legislation for the reforms on March 27  “out of a desire to prevent a rift in the nation”, following weeks of mass protests and a general strike. There has been no let-up in the protests since.

5,"Philippines rescues over 1,000 trafficking victims",MANILA: Philippine authorities have rescued over a thousand people from several Asian nations who were trafficked...,"MANILA: Philippine authorities have rescued over a thousand people from several Asian nations who were trafficked into the country, held captive and forced to run online scams, an official said on Saturday.
International alarm has grown in recent months over internet scams in the region often staffed by trafficking victims tricked or coerced into promoting bogus crypto investments.
Michelle Sabino, a spokeswoman for the Philippine national police force’s anti-cybercrime group, said officers raided a cluster of buildings in Mabalacat city, about 90 kilometres north of Manila.
A total of 1,090 people were rescued who had been recruited to run online scams.
Sabino said the victims were forced to target unsuspecting people in the United States, Europe and Canada.
Their passports were confiscated and they were made to work up to 18 hours a day, with salary deductions for interacting with colleagues or taking extended breaks.
“You’re like a prisoner without a cell. You’re not even allowed to talk to your roommates,” Sabino said.
“They’re not allowed to leave outside the bounds of the gate. After 18 hours of work, they’re brought to their dormitory.” The victims were mostly Chinese nationals, Vietnamese, Filipinos and Indonesians, police said in a separate statement.
Authorities also rescued people from Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, Myanmar, Hong Kong and Nepal.
Sabino said the workers were trained to entice strangers into buying cryptocurrency or depositing money into bogus bank accounts after establishing fake romantic relationships.
“They will build up a promise of a good future together. Let’s buy a house, buy a car, let’s invest money or let’s do business together,” she said.
At least 12 suspected ringleaders of the scheme have been arrested and are set to be charged with human trafficking. They include seven Chinese nationals, four Indonesians and a Malaysian, Sabino said.
Sabino also said the police operation was the result of a plea by the Indonesian ambassador in Manila for help locating distressed nationals. A Philippine immigration official also warned on Saturday against trafficking risks while international events are underway.
“In the past we have recorded victims who claimed they were set to join beauty pageants, shows, only to find out that they were being trafficked abroad,” immigration commissioner Norman Tansingco said in a statement.
The warning comes as Cambodia hosts the Southeast Asian Games, which began on Friday and runs until May 17.
The immigration bureau said Philippine sports officials were asked to warn Filipino athletes of the  “risks of trafficking” in the country. A report last year found people from around Asia have been pulled into cryptocurrency scams in Cambodia, some trafficked and beaten by scam operators.
Last month, Philippine senator Risa Hontiveros warned that  “scam call centres” were operating in the Philippines and employing foreigners trafficked into the country.

6,US F-16 jet crashes during training in South Korea,"The jet’s pilot safely ejected before the crash and was taken to the nearest hospital, US Air Force says.","SEOUL: A US F-16 fighter jet crashed in a farming area south of Seoul during a training exercise on Saturday, said the US military, but appeared to have caused no casualties or property damage.
The jet’s pilot safely ejected before the crash and was taken to the nearest hospital, the US Air Force said in a statement. “An F-16 Fighting Falcon assigned to the 8th Fighter Wing crashed in an agricultural area near Osan Air Base at about 9:45 am” in Gyeonggi province, the statement said.
The crash occurred during a routine training exercise, it said, adding an investigation was underway.
The local fire department was dispatched to the crash site and extinguished the fire, Gyeonggi Governor Kim Dong-yeon said on his Twitter account. Local media said the crash involved no casualties or damage as it took place in a rural area.
“There are no civilian homes nearby the crash, causing no further damage (other than the jet),” a police official was quoted as saying by the Yonhap news agency.
Washington is Seoul’s key security ally and stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea to help protect it from the North.

7,Rohingya say will not go home to Myanmar to be stuck in camps,DHAKA: Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh said on Saturday they would not return to Myanmar to  “be confined in...,"DHAKA: Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh said on Saturday they would not return to Myanmar to  “be confined in camps” after making their first return visit as part of efforts to encourage their voluntary repatriation.
Nearly a million Rohingya Muslims live in squalid camps in the Bangladeshi border district of Cox’s Bazar.
Most have been there since fleeing a military-led crackdown in Buddhist-majority Myanmar in 2017 and had not returned until now, although Bangladeshi officials have made several trips to Myanmar as they seek to repatriate the refugees.
Twenty Rohingya Muslim refugees and seven Bangladeshi officials visited Maungdaw Township and nearby villages in Rakhine State on Friday to see the arrangements for resettlement.
Rohingya have questioned the preparations for repatriation and said they will only go back on a permanent basis if their security is guaranteed and they will be granted citizenship.
We don’t want to be confined in camps. We want to get back our land and we will build our own houses there, Oli Hossain, who was among the refugees who visited Rakhine State, said.
“We’ll only return with citizenship and all our rights,” said the 36-year-old Hossain, father of six children.
Myanmar is offering Rohingya national verification cards (NVC), which Rohingya refugees regard as inadequate.
Myanmar is our birthplace and we are citizens of Myanmar and will only go back with citizenship, said refugee Abu Sufian, 35, father of three children.
Well never accept NVC. This will effectively identify Rohingya as foreigners, he told Reuters. The authorities had  “even changed the name of my village in Rakhine,” he added.
Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, Bangladesh’s refugee relief and repatriation commissioner in Cox’s Bazar, said repatriation was the only solution. “We want nothing but a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable repatriation, he said.
He also said a team from Myanmar would come to Bangladesh within a week as a follow-up to build confidence among Rohingya. A Myanmar junta spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment.
Myanmar’s military had until recently shown little inclination to take back any Rohingya, who have for years been regarded as foreign interlopers in Myanmar and denied citizenship and subjected to abuse.
A Myanmar delegation, however, visited the camps in March to verify a few hundred returnees for a pilot repatriation project.
A Bangladesh official said the project would involve about 1,100 refugees but no date had been set. Attempts to begin repatriation in 2018 and 2019 failed as the refugees, fearing violence, refused to go back.
The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said every refugee had  “an inalienable right” to return to their home country, but that returns also had to be voluntary.
UNHCR maintains that dialogue with the Rohingya refugees is a must to make an informed decision, the agency said in a statement.
Visits are an important part of voluntary refugee returns, providing a chance for people to observe conditions in their home country first-hand ahead of return and contributing to the making of an informed decision on return, it said further.

8,50 aftershocks shake Japan after Friday quake,"TOKYO: Aftershocks shook Japan a day after a powerful earthquake left at least one person dead, with officials...","TOKYO: Aftershocks shook Japan a day after a powerful earthquake left at least one person dead, with officials assessing damage on Saturday from the jolt that destroyed several buildings.
The 6.5 magnitude quake hit the central Ishikawa region mid-afternoon on Friday at a depth of 12 kilometres (seven miles), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.
More than 50 aftershocks, some of them strong, had occurred by Saturday morning, the agency said, as it warned that heavy rain could trigger landslides in the area.
At least 29 people had been injured, Japan’s disaster management agency said.
“Our staff are out checking damage from the quake,” an official from Suzu in Ishikawa prefecture, the hardest-hit city, said. Two people trapped inside destroyed buildings were rescued, he said.
An evacuation order was issued for 1,630 residents of Suzu, with about 250 taking shelter in evacuation centres, Jiji news agency reported. More than 100 households were without running water as of Saturday afternoon, and roads were closed in many areas, the agency added. The city had provided temporary public supplies after running water had turned brown in parts of the region, officials said earlier.
TV footage showed a grocery shop strewn with broken wine bottles and other products that had fallen from shelves. Some residents were seen clearing rubble in the rain after their wooden houses were partially destroyed.
“I asked a carpenter for a makeshift fix of the house, and the house is now covered with a blue tarp to protect it from rainwater,” one man told public broadcaster NHK.

9,52 arrested during King Charles’ coronation,"Since Charles became king last September, there have been protests at royal events.","LONDON: Police arrested the leader of the anti-monarchy group Republic and 51 others at King Charles’ coronation on Saturday, with officers saying their duty to prevent disruption outweighed the right to protest.
Hundreds of yellow-clad demonstrators gathered among the 10-deep crowds lining the procession route in central London to stand out from those clad in red, white and blue, and to hold up signs saying  “Not My King”.
The Republic campaign group said its leader Graham Smith had been detained before the procession began and photos circulated on social media showing police officers seizing the demonstrators’ placards.
“We absolutely understand public concern following the arrests we made this morning,” Commander Karen Findlay of the London Metropolitan police said in a statement.
“Over the past 24 hours there has been a significant police operation after we received information protesters were determined to disrupt the Coronation procession.”
Republic had vowed to mount the biggest protest against a British monarch in modern history and protesters booed as King Charles and Queen Camilla made their way to Westminster Abbey, and as the service was relayed publicly on large speakers.
“It is disgusting and massively over the top,” said Kevin John, 57, a salesman from Devon who was among the protesters.
“It is also hugely counterproductive by the police because all it has done is create a massive amount of publicity for us. It is completely crazy.”
Police did not confirm Smith’s arrest. They said they had acted because they believed protesters would seek to deface public monuments with paint and disrupt  “official movements”.
“All of these people remain in custody,” Findlay said.
Protests also took place in Glasgow in Scotland and Cardiff in Wales, with participants holding up signs saying:  “Abolish the monarchy, feed the people.” On social media, many contrasted the cost of living crisis in Britain with the pomp and pageantry on display at the coronation.
Although the protesters were in a minority compared with the tens of thousands gathered on London’s streets to support the king, polls suggest support for the monarchy is declining and is weakest among young people.
With the crown passing from Queen Elizabeth to her less popular son, republican activists hope Charles will be the last British monarch to be crowned.
“It has a hereditary billionaire individual born into wealth and privilege who basically symbolises the inequality of wealth and power in our society,” said Clive Lewis, an opposition Labour Party lawmaker.
In London, protesters demanded an elected head of state. They say that the royal family has no place in a modern constitutional democracy and is staggeringly expensive to maintain. “Don’t you think this is all a bit silly,” said one placard.
Most of the anti-monarchy protesters on Saturday had congregated in Trafalgar Square next to the bronze statue of King Charles I, who was beheaded in 1649, leading to a short-lived republic.
Since Charles became king last September, there have been protests at royal events. He was heckled at a Commonwealth Day event at Westminster Abbey in March and targeted with eggs in York in November.
The death of the queen has also reignited debate in Australia, Jamaica and other parts of the commonwealth about the need to retain Charles as their head of state.
The state government of New South Wales said it had decided not to light up the sails of the Sydney Opera House to mark the coronation in order to save money. Events to mark the coronation in other countries where Charles is head of state were also low key.
While many other European monarchies have come and gone, or are far diminished in scale and importance, the British royal family has remained remarkably resilient.
In Britain, polls show the majority of the population still want the royal family, but there is a long-term trend of declining support.
A poll by YouGov last month found 64pc of people in Britain said they had little or no interest in the coronation. Among those aged 18 to 24, the number voicing little or no interest rose to 75pc.

10,UK blends old and new traditions as public’s appetite for British monarchy is shrinking,"WHAT could one expect at the coronation ceremony of a King in the year 2023, at a moment the public’s appetite for...","WHAT could one expect at the coronation ceremony of a King in the year 2023, at a moment the public’s appetite for the monarchy is shrinking and there are global calls for the United Kingdom to apologise for its role in colonialism and the slave trade? 
Less than six months after the release of Harry and Megan’s Netflix documentary, in which the monarchy was painted out to be racist, misogynistic and insensitive, the world watched as the new King of the United Kingdom tried to hit the right political notes in a ceremony steeped in longstanding tradition and pageantry.
“There were very significant efforts to recognise that the Britain of 2023 versus 1953, which was the last time the world saw a coronation, is different,” said Sunder Katwala, director of think-tank British Future. “It was tricky — a balancing act — as they did not change anything formally about the tradition which is inherently a Christian tradition. Yet there were efforts to recognise the multi-faith nature of our society.”
Mr Katwala was referring to the inclusion of Jews, Muslims and Sikhs who played a historic role in the King’s coronation ceremony on Saturday. “Rather than faith leaders, members of the House of Lords who are from different religions handed King Charles his regalia. It showed that these items are part of the state and the state belongs to every faith.”
Muslim Conserva­tive Party Peer Lord Kamall was seen carrying the armills — a set of gold bracelets — to the king. Baroness Merron, a Jewish peer, Lord Singh, a Sikh, and Lord Patel, a Hindu, delivered a robe, glove and ring.
The ceremony, it seemed, reflected a lot of the King’s own outlook on what the monarchy means in today’s world  — especially at a time when religious and sectarian differences are rife in many parts of the world.
British Pakistanis also participated in the ceremony.  Sara Yasin, a 17-year-old Sea Cadet from Southampton, said the moment was “surreal”.
Speaking to Dawn, Ms Yasin said, “It’s been fantastic! Really exciting and so surreal. We had to march down to the foreign commonwealth offices, then opposite Westminster Abbey and Parliament Square. We saluted the King as he came past.”
Ms Yasin said it was a “privilege to be chosen for this role as a Pakistani”. “I haven’t met other hijab-wearing cadets like myself. It’s so encouraging for Muslim girls to even see that I was a part of this procession. It shows that the parade was a true representation of Britain.”
Ms Yasin said she added that she saw people of different faiths not just watching the event, but also participating. “It was a coronation for everyone.”
Saquib Yasin, Ms Yasin’s father, said he received an email some weeks earlier from the Southern Commander to her unit asking if she could participate. “Sara had been part of Sea Cadets marching competition last year and won the national award. Because of that, the military command remembered how good she was. They contacted Southampton to invite Sara — they hand picked her — saying she is an exemplar and that they don’t want anyone else.”
British Pakistani youth Atif Ali, who in 2021 was awarded the British Empire Medal in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list for his services to the community in Birmingham during Covid-19, was also among the 2,000 people invited to attend the ceremony.
“I was invited to the ceremony out of the blue. The atmosphere was fantastic and it was a really nice feeling. At first I thought the invitation was a spam email,” Mr Ali said in an interview, expressing his disbelief at being invited.
Mr Ali was recognised for his work with disabled children and adults during the pandemic. “My father came here in 1980s. He was a factory worker. He never thought that a member of our family would be at Westminster Abbey to attend the coronation. My cousins keep asking me to send photos of Kate, William and Harry. I told them 
we can’t take photos inside, they should watch it on TV!”
The inclusion of British Pakistanis in the ceremony was not just a nod to the community’s representation in the United Kingdom, but also to the King’s personal interest in the region.
Hitan Mehta of the British Asian Trust in an interview described the King’s concern for the floods in Pakistan. “It must have been nine o’clock on a Friday night and I get a phone call from him saying: ‘I’ve just heard about the floods in Pakistan. What are we doing?’ It’s not as if he’s not a busy person. But he’s heard of the problem and he’s on it. He really does care,” Mr Mehta said.
There were moments that could have been planned more thoughtfully, like when Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, a Hindu, was made to read an Epistle from the New Testament which Mr Katwala described as a “strong profession of the Christian faith as opposed to reading something about multi-faith harmony”. But overall, Mr Katwala said the new King was trying deliberately hard not to “rock the boat”.
The internet could not get enough of the sword-wielding moment featuring Conservative MP Penny Mourdant, who became the first woman to carry and present the ceremonial sword to the king. There was also the choice of the gospel choir, which brought a fresh, modern twist to the ancient ceremony. At the end, Mr Katwala said, “There was a lot of goodwill, but it was a balancing act.”
