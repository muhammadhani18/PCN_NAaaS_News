1,Recommendations sought for revival of Lumberdari system,DC says job description of headmen needs to be updated,"LAHORE: Local administration has intensified efforts to reactivate the Lambardari system in a bid to improve revenue collection, service delivery and resolve petty issues within territorial limits of the Lahore City District, seeking recommendations from all five assistant commissioners of Lahore with regard to filling the vacant posts of lambardars (village headmen), and assigning jobs (with some change to the job description as per current needs) to them under the relevant rules and regulations, Dawn has learnt.
“The work on reactivating the system in Lahore has been accelerated [and] we, in a recent meeting, directed the Lahore commissioner to improve revenue collection and delivery of services through village headmen and others concerned. Hopefully, they (the officers concerned) will take keen interest in this regard,” Board of Revenue (BoR) Senior Member/Punjab Chief Commissioner (relief) Mr Nabeel Javed told Dawn on Saturday.  
“We are also going to revamp the Chokidari [watchman] system in Lahore and other parts of Punjab,” Mr Nabeel revealed.
Under the Land Revenue Rules-1968, the duties assigned to the village headmen under the law have been explained. The rules state that the headmen will “collect, by due date, the land revenue and all sums recoverable as land revenue from the estate, or subdivision of any estate in which he holds office, and pay the same personally or by revenue money order or by remittance of currency notes through the post or at place where treasury business is conducted by the State Bank of Pakistan, or any other bank, by cheque, on a local bank, at the place and time appointed in that behalf, to the tehsildar concerned.

DC says job description of headmen needs to be updated

“The headmen are supposed to collect rents and other income of the common land and account for these to the persons entitled thereto and issue receipts to the land owners and others through Form-1 in token of having recovered the government dues from them. Under the rules, the government is liable to appoint a sufficient number of headmen in every estate and this number, when once fixed, shall not be increased or reduced except by or under the orders of commissioner.”
The BoR chief said: “There are various taxes, fees etc liable to be collected by the Lambradars and other revenue officials. These include Agriculture income tax, Abiana (charges related to water supply to agriculture land, irrigation etc), stamp duty and mutation fee. We are also set to introduce an online system (called E-Abiana) for the collection of water charges.”  
He added that the activation of Lambardari system will also help improve service delivery and resolve various petty local issues arising in villages.
According to a letter written to the ACs of Lahore City, Raiwind, Cantonment, Model Town and Shalimar tehsils, the city administration has sought information regarding vacancies of Lambardars for creation of a comprehensive database and fresh recruitment against the vacant posts.  
As per the administration the total sanctioned posts of headmen in Lahore are 406 that included four in Lahore City, 91 in Raiwind, 147 in Lahore Cantt, 72 in Model Town and 92 in Model Town tehsils. Of these, 207 headmen are permanent, while 64 are temporary, while 135 posts are yet to be filled.
“You are requested to send proposals/recommendations for appointment of suitable candidates against the vacant posts of Lambardars under Rule 17 of the Punjab Land Record Rules 1968,” the letter written by the additional deputy commissioner (revenue) to the ACs says.
Talking to Dawn, Lahore Deputy Commissioner Ms Rafia Haider said the Lambardari system in Lahore has almost become non-functional because of speedy urbanisation. She is of the view that since Lahore’s most parts are urban now, the system also needs to be updated through introducing changes in the job description of these headmen.
“There are many villages in Lahore that, currently, have been converted into urban areas. So, keeping in view this factor, the job description of a headman — the last tier of the revenue department — needs to be changed considering the public issues,” she said.  
She said once she received recommendations from the ACs, she would not only ensure appointment of headmen on all vacant posts, but also make working of these officials beneficial to the public at large, as well as the government.

2,Harking back: The forgotten Punjabi ‘martyrs’ in lands faraway,Just over 50 years ago when my oldest childhood friend Asad and I hitchhiked from Lahore to London and back on a...,"Just over 50 years ago when my oldest childhood friend Asad and I hitchhiked from Lahore to London and back on a six-month crazy adventure, our stop in Belgium was, probably, the most memorable. Wherever we went Lahore, and the Punjab, glared us in the face.
In Belgium we visited the Ypres Salient, a set of trenches that have been conserved as a ‘museum’. Among these trenches was a Punjab Trench Museum, which is near the Menin Gate (Menenstraat) memorial. This piece will deal with the trench museum, the Menin Gate Monument, and, lastly, how it relates to the old walled city of Lahore. It was a memory that strongly remains in my mind.  
As we climbed down into the trench, one could feel like we were entering a narrow dark world. The thought came to our minds just how could humans remain here for over a year, fighting an “entrenched” battle. The age of the sniper was born.
Down in Turkey the Turks had pinned down Australian and New Zealander invaders in a battle over possession of Gallipoli, a war to control the Dardanelles to re-establish control over sea routes to Russia that led to the end of the Ottoman Empire. The current war in Ukraine is somewhat similar in objectives with the biggest power now being the invisible villain.
In the Punjab Trench we read hundreds of postcards (brown ones of those days) in which Punjabi soldiers had written back home, trying to describe the battle situation. The British colonialists had, naturally, imposed a strict censorship on information flow (you might wonder what has changed), so our soldiers used their own version. One card stood out. “Over the last few days the chillies have become hotter,” wrote this soldier from Jhelum. His letter was deemed as letting out too much detail. To the wall it ended up.
But then there was a Pritam Singh from Lohari Bazaar of Lahore who wrote: “We cannot waste a single bullet to kill a dog, let alone a German, for one does not feel like killing a ‘goora’”. What a laugh we had then on this letter, which was understandable. For three long hours we read scores of such letters. One read: “It’s so cold even my real gun is dead,” said Mian Bakhtiar of Baghbanpura, Lahore. Trust an Arain to get his gun correct. His letter was censored for being rude. Imagine.
But colourful that most descriptions were, the sadness was clear. We walked over to the Menin Gate War Memorial and on the walls names such as Muhammad, Abdul, Khan, Mian, Singh, and other such sub-continental names glared out. We made a note of many of them. A few historic plaques informed that Indian soldiers were led by the 24th Punjab Infantry, which had served their ‘masters’ in Cyprus, Egypt, China, the Persian Gulf, Africa, Burma and Afghanistan, as well as in Tibet and Abyssinia. It seems the Punjabis served the British with immense honour.
The most soldiers in the half a million fighting soldiers were Punjabi Muslims, followed by Punjabi Sikhs, then come the Pathans, the Dogras, Indian Muslims and Jats. One does not wish to classify them on communal grounds, for a bullet of an enemy does not seek religious targets. When WW1 started the then British Indian Army had 152,496 combat soldiers, of which over 100,000 were from the Punjab.
By the time the November 1918 Armistice was signed, these numbers of combat Indian soldiers had risen to 563,091, of which over 400,000 were Punjabi combat soldiers. Of the non-combatants were porters, sweepers, ‘bhishtis’ and ‘syces’, with the majority from the United Provinces (UP). One research breaks down the combat soldiers as being 190,078 Muslims, 97,016 Punjabi Sikhs, and 83,515 Hindu Jats.
In terms of origin of the Punjabi soldiers the Rawalpindi Division of Pakistan supplied the most soldiers, followed by Jullunder, Ambala and the Lahore Division. Here we see the Lahore supplied the most officers, with the lowest being Bengalis a mere 7,117 combat soldiers. Apparently the British had doubts about the fighting abilities of Bengalis.
We see that three Punjabis out of 16 soldiers won the Victoria Cross, 22 out of 99 the Military Cross and 125 Punjabis won the Order of British India. Nearly 200 Punjabis received land as ‘jagirs’, with officers getting 50 acres and soldiers 25 acres each. The class segregation was well in place.
But then in WW1 we see over 36,000 Indian soldiers were killed which comes to 2.6 per cent of the total, mostly in the initial phase of the war in 1915 when fierce hand-to-hand fighting took place. The Germans labelled Punjabis as ‘mad fighters’. A Sikh soldier classified the feeling as if it was a “war which Hanuman made”. The details of this war can fill up many a book that is if we are interested in our collective non-communal past.
Now on to how on our return from a crazy, but highly-educating six-month trek, I set about using my notes to track down the ancestors of the martyrs of Ypres, let alone a few hundred other battlefields. It makes one sad just how our brave soldiers of years past are ignored. In past columns one has advocated Monuments to Unknown Soldiers in Lahore, and other relevant places, but to no effect.
If we go back just 165 years when during the 1857 Uprising, nearly 1,600 persons, soldiers included, were blown up by cannons placed outside the Lahore Fort, outside Lohari Gate, Delhi Gate and Taxali Gate for the slightest whim of opposition. For example a poor man carrying a long staff was caught in Old Anarkali Bazaar, and on pleading that it was a walking stick, the soldiers dragged him to a nearby cannon and he was blown up. The record says: ‘He made a good example’.
But then the WW1 and WW2 soldiers were ‘recruited’ martyrs, and they deserve to be remembered. The British certainly did a reasonable job looking after them, and in many a way still do recall them in monuments and special occasions. But what went wrong with a highly communal sub-continent? It is time we all woke up and look at our history.
Imagine in India the name of Tipu Sultan is also being erased. In Pakistan our history starts once the Afghan invader Mahmud murdered thousands of local people and sold as slaves over 200,000 women from Lahore and surroundings in faraway markets.
Surely our combat soldiers deserve to be shown some respect. Life for senior officers is now the most sought position people dream of. Will this dream ever end? One has serious doubts.

Covering approximately three acres, the aviary was previously home to a diverse range of bird species from various origins. However, in response to the overwhelming public interest, the management of Lahore Safari has made the exciting decision to dedicate the entire space to peacocks. Visitors can now marvel at peacocks of different hues and colours, including stunning white, mesmerising blue, regal black shoulder, and captivating pied varieties.
Deputy Director Ghulam Rasool of Lahore Zoo Safari says, “We have acquired a substantial number of peacocks, with around 100 being sent to Lahore Safari from Jallo Wildlife Park and Lahore Zoo. Witnessing over 200 peacocks gathered in one place will truly be a sight to behold. That is why we have made the decision to re-designate the bird aviary as ‘Peacock Paradise.’”
In addition to the peacocks, the aviary will also house various waterfowl species, which will thrive in the safari’s picturesque water pond.
Currently, the aviary boasts an impressive population of 128 peacocks, accompanied by 67 mallards, 20 pheasants, 14 cranes, 67 Muscovy ducks, 16 common geese, and three black swans. To facilitate the transformation, several birds from the safari have been relocated to new enclosures. Looking ahead, Mr Rasool revealed exciting plans for the aviary, including the allocation of Rs50 million from the Annual Development Programme to procure new animals and birds. This will enable the introduction of exotic parrots and other fascinating bird species into Lahore Zoo Safari, housed within state-of-the-art enclosures.
Mr Rasool said that in their commitment to continual improvement, Lahore Zoo Safari is undertaking various upgrades. Four previously non-functional security checkpoints have now been made operational, and the guards have been equipped with modern weapons to ensure enhanced safety and security throughout the safari.
He affirmed, “We are dedicated to elevating the safari’s standards, which includes introducing new and captivating bird and animal species.” In line with this vision, a project for a natural history museum is in progress, which will undoubtedly serve as a valuable resource for wildlife researchers and zoology students. Furthermore, tram service is currently being finalized, which will provide visitors with a comprehensive tour of each cage while an official imparts fascinating insights about the animals and birds encountered along the way.

11,Caretakers solicit NAB probe into flour scam charges,Naqvi says govt has decided to go for audit of scheme,"LAHORE: Sensing that corruption allegations worth billions of rupees in the free flour distribution programme in Punjab may haunt the incumbent caretaker set-up especially its head Mohsin Naqvi after elections, it has requested the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to carry out a probe into the matter “to verify if anything of the sort has been done by any nefarious elements.”
Although the provincial caretaker government had declared over Rs20 billion corruption allegations made by PML-N leader and former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi regarding free flour scheme “false and fabricated,” it was advised by some ‘friends’ in the federal coalition to ‘get a clean chit’ from the anti-graft body before its tenure comes to an end.
“We have sent a request to the Chairman NAB to check into the (free flour) programme to verify if anything of the sort has been done by any nefarious elements,” Punjab caretaker chief minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a tweet on Saturday.
He further said: “We have decided to go for an immediate audit through the Auditor General Pakistan office, and simultaneously through a private audit firm of established international repute.”  

Naqvi says govt has decided to go for audit of scheme 

Mr Abbasi recently alleged that Rs20bn were embezzled during the free floor distribution scheme. “Recently, Rs84bn worth of free flour was distributed. I am sorry to say that approximately Rs20bn were looted,” he said.  
The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had demanded an independent investigation into the allegations of Mr Abbasi saying “the easy and transparent way of cash distribution was deliberately ignored. The cat is out of the bag after Abbasi’s allegations and now this scheme should be thoroughly investigated by NAB.”
Although the caretaker government had demanded apology from Mr Abbasi for maligning it but the latter [instead] stood by his statement saying he had talked about ‘systematic corruption’ in such schemes.  
“Mr Naqvi had complained to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif about Mr Abbasi’s glaring allegation and requested him to ask him (Abbasi) to withdraw it but he did not,” a source in the government told Dawn.  
He said seeing it a ‘potential case’ if his opponents come to power after its departure, Mohsin Naqvi has been advised to get his and his government’s name cleared through the NAB with the help of the federal coalition.

15,Imran again seeks video-link facility for hearing of cases,"In fresh plea, PTI chief says a plethora of “false” cases have been registered against him.","LAHORE: As a Lahore High Court larger bench is set to resume the hearing on Monday on a petition of former prime minister Imran Khan seeking quashment of as many as 121 cases registered against him, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chief has made a fresh request for allowing him appearance in these cases through video-link facility.
In a civil miscellaneous application filed in the pending main petition, Khan says a plethora of “false” cases have been registered against him and he is required to appear repeatedly before various judicial forums to defend himself.
The PTI chief pleads that on each occasion of his appearance before a judicial forum, he faces a serious threat to his life due to the lack of security being provided to him despite his entitlement as a former prime minister.
He submits that permitting him to appear through video-link for the hearings will be cost-effective and viable for the administration of the criminal justice system, as there will be no need to deploy thousands of security officials on the occasion of his court appearance.
Therefore, the petitioner asks the court to allow him to participate and appear in all cases against him within the jurisdiction of the LHC through video-link with the aid of modern and scientific devices in the interests of justice.
He also urges the court to direct the respondents/authorities to facilitate him and make necessary arrangements in this regard.
Headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, the five-judge larger bench on May 2 directed the PTI chairman to join the investigation of the cases against him. The bench had also directed the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to present its report on Monday.
Justice Aalia Neelum, Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh, Justice Anwarul Haq Pannun and Justice Muhammad Amjad Rafiq are the other members of the bench.
A JIT on Friday visited the Zaman Park to record the statement of the former prime minister and to collect evidence of the violence and attacks by the PTI workers on the police teams.

16,Sher-i-Mysore – revisiting the legend of Tipu Sultan,"LAHORE: Tipu Sultan was killed during the Battle of Seringapatam or Siege of Seringapatam on May 4, 1799. A play,...","LAHORE: Tipu Sultan was killed during the Battle of Seringapatam or Siege of Seringapatam on May 4, 1799. A play, Sher-i-Mysore, was enacted at the Government College University (GCU) to commemorate the fall of Mysore and killing of Tipu Sultan by the British who were supported by the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas.  
The objective of the play, as told by a character at the start, is to revisit the story because the historical version of Tipu Sultan’s legend tells only what happened but not why it happened. Most of the cast included the students of the GCU; however, the lead role of Tipu was played by an old Ravian, Dr Salman Bhatti, the chairperson of the Department of Urdu at the University of Education. The character of Lord Wellesley was played by Dr Sameer Ahmed of the GCU English Department who was also the writer of the play. 
The play is a take on the circumstances that led to the debacle of 1799 and the fall of the last fort against the British capture of India. At the start of the play, the spirits of the characters, who conspired against Tipu Sultan and secretly supported the British, talk about retelling the story and their versions of it, interpreting it in their own way.  
In the flashbacks, Tipu’s childhood is revisited where the wisdom of his father, Hyder Ali, in the act of war is shown. The character propagates accepting defeat when one is surrounded and there is no way out. The dialogue is repeated at the end of the play too.  
The play retells the background story at what transpired the fall of Tipu Sultan who had lost all the friends in the region and made enemies of the Marathas and Nizam who had fought against the East India Company in support of his father, Hyder Ali. All his efforts to get the support from the French and the Ottomans didn’t bear fruit.  
The character of Tipu Sultan appears as an isolated man, very stubborn and looking backwards while other characters around him like his Wazirs and his wife play his foils, trying to talk some sense into him. The dialogues of his wife in a scene appear more prophetic who tries to make him realise that the British are not going to leave. She urges him to deliberate on the situation, which is ‘inevitable.’ The inevitability looks like the leitmotif as it recurs in the play, propagated by Tipu’s wife, Wazirs and Lord Wellesley. The dialogues of the characters in Tipu’s opposition, including his wife’s, look more convincing than Tipu’s even if it might not be the intention of the playwright. The last scenes of the play try to retrieve the situation in favour of the character of Tipu with the famous dialogues like “to live like a lion for a day is far better than to live for a 100 years like a jackal” but then it’s too late to revive the image of the Sultan who finds himself isolated at the end. 
In real life too, Tipu Sultan when defeat became ‘inevitable’ at Seringapatam was asked by his French advisers to escape the fort to fight against the British from his other fronts but he had refused to do so.  
The set design of the play was magnificent, depicting the summer palace of Tipu Sultan in Banglore (Bangaluru). Playwright Asghar Nadeem Syed on the opening of the play was all praise for it, saying it depicted exactly the same scenes as were the palaces of Tipu Sultan in Mysore that he had seen during his visit to the city.
The play raises some pertinent questions including whether it was possible for Tipu Sultan to evade his complete downfall as the victory of the British was ‘inevitable’ or whether he could find a middle way, of course by striking a deal with the invaders. However, it’s also important to note that it’s hard for a 21st century post-colonial mind of this region to understand the mind of the ruler of Mysore with all his inherited grandeur. 
The comic relief was provided by the two darbans, Qutbuddin and Raja Khan, who at times appeared like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of Shakespeare’s Hamlet. However, they did succeed in making the historical tragedy somewhat light for the audience. The acting of all the actors was flawless with some exception with one odd hyperbolic performance here and there. There was a tinge of stereotyping of Purnaiah, the Hindu statesman who was an important figure in the court of the Sultan but who also betrayed him like Mir Sadiq. The actor in the lead role, Dr Salman Bhatti, deserves accolades for his performance despite the somewhat subdued character of Tipu Sultan.  
The team of directors was led by Muzammil Shabbir. Today (Sunday) is the last day of the play.

17,Theft of railway steel goes unchecked,"RAHIM YAR KHAN: The theft of unserviceable sleeper blocks for steel extraction, including some track material along...","


 
RAHIM YAR KHAN: The theft of unserviceable sleeper blocks for steel extraction, including some track material along the main railway track of ML-I between Khanpur and Rahim Yar Khan, has been on the rise for the last few months, posing a constant life threat to rail passengers.
Railway sources have revealed that gangs from Chak 72-P and other villages along the railway line are stealing the material with the connivance of the permanent way inspector (PWI) of Khanpur staff and Kotsamaba police.
A new PCS sleeper block costs Rs36,000 and is replaced with unserviceable sleepers on the railway track. There are thousands of unserviceable sleepers along both sides of ML-I between Khanpur and Dahirki railway stations. Up to 13 kilograms of steel is used in a sleeper. The thieves sell the steel for Rs3,500 to Rs4,000 to scrap dealers.  
Sources also said a significant quantity of precious timber from old sleepers at two big depots of Sahja and Kotsamaba railway stations has been the target of thieves with the connivance of the railway staff. They sell it to people to make doors and windows of houses. The sources added that every sleeper, either of steel or timber, is documented in the PWI office.
On April 21, the Sahja police registered a case against four people for stealing railway installations from the main railway track ML-1 near Kotsamaba railway station on Friday. The suspects not only damaged the railway track but also put the lives of railway passengers at risk.
According to the FIR, keyman Abdul Razaq intercepted a man at kilometer No 5/673-4 near Chak 72-P, stealing T-bolt clips. Razaq tried to catch him but the thief fled towards nearby Chak 72-P.  
Meanwhile, Chaudhry Abdul Ghafoor with two people rescued the thief with stolen railway material and escaped. Gangmen Nazar Hussain and Nasir Abbas arrived there and checked the railway track and found 12 T-nut bolts and clips were missing. By this act of theft, the suspects not only damaged the railway track but put the lives of railway passengers at risk.
When some railway employees complained about this practice to Kotsamaba police, it said that this was in the jurisdiction of Sahja police. It is also learnt that two railway officials of Sukkur division visited the Kotsamaba railway station on April 21 to inquire about the matter. 
Khanpur Assistant Way Inspector Muhammad Iqbal said that the incidents of theft were a regular matter, and they had informed the PWI about these cases, but not a single criminal had been arrested yet. He said that when the PWI staff caught a thief red-handed on April 21, the railway staff received threats from them after they rescued the thief. However, a new machine has arrived, which will start stocking sleepers to avoid theft.
Railway spokesperson Babar Ali said that the railway police will take a stance on the issue. Railway Police spokesperson Muhammad Umair told Dawn that the area of the railway network is wide enough, and with each passing day, the number of employees is getting smaller. To overcome the shortage of employees, no new inductions took place in the railway police.  
The railway department conducts round-the-clock push trolley track patrolling in the area where railway material is stored to prevent theft of the same. If the incident of theft comes to the attention of the railway police within its jurisdiction, prompt action is taken.  
The railway police and railway staff are experiencing an acute shortage of staff, which could be the reason for the rising theft. But we are leaving no stone unturned to deal with this issue under the incumbent command of the railway police.  
As far as the police is concerned, strict directions are being passed by high-ups from the Central Police Office to take immediate action and every possible measure in the form of assistance to the railway to prevent the theft of railway material.
