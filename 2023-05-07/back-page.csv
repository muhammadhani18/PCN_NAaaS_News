• Fresh challenge filed against newly enacted legislation 
ISLAMABAD: As the top court is set to resume hearing petitions on Monday against a newly enacted law aimed at limiting the chief justice’s powers, the government has requested the Supreme Court to form a full court to consider important questions regarding the judiciary’s independence and parliament’s powers to regulate court’s procedure.
Separately, the government has also asked the court to dismiss the challenges to the law — the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023. However, on Saturday, a Lahore-based lawyer filed a fresh petition, asking the court to strike down the piece of legislation as it allegedly violated the basic structure of the Constitution.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, an eight-judge Supreme Court bench will on Monday resume hearing the challenges to the law.
In its request seeking a full court, the federal government has argued that the April 13 suspension of the law reflected that the apex court apparently believed that the proposed legislation was a serious encroachment upon, interference with and intrusion into the independence of the judiciary.
It insisted that it had full confidence in every judge of the Supreme Court and did not want any particular judge to hear the petition. But considering the paramount importance of the questions involved in the matter, the petitions against the law should be heard by all the SC judges.
The government said in the application that it was “fully conscious” that it was its duty to uphold the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law and that it had “never wavered” in performing this duty.
The government said it was also conscious of the doctrine of trichotomy of powers and the independent role of three pillars of the state, as expounded by the Supreme Court.
It noted that any encroachment in the domain of another institution had been frowned upon by the apex court. “Therefore, keeping in view these principles in mind, the parliament in its wisdom as the representative body of the people of Pakistan and being well aware of the constitutional scheme of separation of powers passed the Supreme Court (Practise and Procedure) Act, 2023,” the petition said.
The government insisted that the law had been passed by the parliament regulating the practice and procedure of the judicial organ of the state in the exercise of its powers under the Constitution.
“The importance of the case at hand is not any less but equally critical as it requires the power of the legislature to regulate the practice and procedure of the judicial organ on the one hand and the constitutional command to secure the independence of the judiciary on the other,” the petition said.
“To deviate from the precedent law will cause unnecessary controversy, though may be unfounded, and will not be conducive for the image of both the organ of the state,” it said.
New petition
Meanwhile, a new petition has been filed in the Supreme Court by Advocate Mudassar Hassan Jura through his counsel Hasan Irfan Khan, seeking to strike down the law.
The petition argued that the constitutional rule-making powers conferred by Article 191 of the Constitution and already exercised by the Supreme Court could not be taken away, nullified, amended or rescinded by sub-constitutional legislation or an act of parliament, especially when passed by a simple majority.
It said that constitutional powers were conferred by at least a two-thirds majority of the parliament, and they had the force of the Constitution and were superior to any law circumventing such powers.

1,Israeli forces kill two more Palestinians in occupied West Bank,Israeli army says the two were involved in a shooting earlier this month.,"RAMALLAH: Israeli troops killed two Palestinians on Saturday in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said, as the army claimed to have targeted the perpetrators of a “shooting attack”.
“Two martyrs, shot by the occupation (Israeli forces) arrived at Thabet Thabet government hospital,” in the city of Tulkarm, the health ministry said in a statement.
In a separate statement, the ministry named the two men as Hamza Khrewish and Samer al-Shafei, both 22, and said that one other person was injured in the raid.
The Israeli army said the pair were “involved in the shooting attack in Avnei Heftz on May 2, 2023 during which an Israeli civilian was injured”.
“The two gunmen were shot and killed after attempting to flee the scene,” an army statement said, adding that two others were arrested in the operation.
“Two M-16 rifles, military vests and magazines” were confiscated during the raid, the army said.
Hundreds of mourners later gathered for the funerals of the two men whose bodies, shrouded in the Palestinian flag, were carried through the streets of Tulkarm.
Avnei Heftz is a settlement in the West Bank deemed illegal under international law.
The Tulkarm Brigade, a local militant group linked to the Al- Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade, the armed wing of the ruling Fatah party, claimed the two men as members.
The group also took responsibility for the Avnei Heftz attack, calling it a “revenge operation,” according to a statement.
A comprehensive strike was called in the Tulkarm governorate by local authorities in response to the operation.
On Thursday, Israeli security forces shot dead three Palestinians blamed for killing a British-Israeli woman and two of her daughters last month in the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967.
Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, said all three men killed in what it termed an “assassination” were from its ranks, hailing them as “heroes of resistance”.
Earlier in the week, Israel traded air strikes and fire with Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza following the death in Israeli custody of Khader Adnan, a Palestinian prisoner on hunger strike.
The latest violence brings to 108 the number of Palestinians killed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so far this year.

2,Over 50 dead as ethnic clashes flare up in India,"Churches, schools, houses set ablaze in India’s northeastern Manipur state.","NEW DELHI: India’s northeastern Manipur state remained tense on Saturday after clashes broke out between predominantly Hindu Meitei and Christian Kuki groups on Wednesday over moves to accord tribal status to the dominant Meiti group, reports said.
Vehicles, houses, schools, churches and commercial properties were set ablaze by protesting mobs after the Tribal Solidarity March, organised by the All Tribal Students’ Union of Manipur, to protest against the Meitei community’s demand to be included in the list of Scheduled Tribes.
Manipur DGP said the situation in the state improved after the intervention of security forces. As many as 54 people have lost their lives in the violence, officials told Press Trust of India.
A paramilitary commando on leave was shot dead by armed assailants in his village in Manipur’s Churachandpur district on Friday, officials told Press Trust of India. In the wake of constable Chonkholen Haokip being killed, the CRPF directed its personnel hailing from Manipur and on leave in their home state to “immediately” report to their nearest security base with family members.

Churches, schools, houses set ablaze in Manipur

A defence spokesperson said a total of 13,000 people were rescued and shifted to safe shelters.
On Wednesday, violence ensued in the Bishnupur and Churachandpur districts of Manipur leading to destruction of homes, temples and churches that quickly escalated to other districts over the following days.
The Scheduled Tribes Demand Committee of Manipur recommends the parameters to accept or deny tribal status that grants affirmative action. It has said that the Meiteis, who are included in the Other Backward Class category, were excluded from the Scheduled Tribe list without any constitutional safeguards, thereby marginalising them in their ancestral land.
In opposition to their demands for inclusion, the United Naga Council has argued that the inclusion of Meiteis would defeat the purpose of the Scheduled Tribes list, which is to provide protective discrimination for groups that require it.
Manipur comprises 34 recognised Scheduled Tribes, broadly falling under the Naga and Kukichin or Kuki tribal groups. The hills, inhabited by the tribals, amount to around 90 per cent of Manipur’s total area whereas the Imphal valley, where the dominant Meitei community primarily resides, makes up the remaining 10pc of the state’s area. The tribals are largely Christian, while the majority of Meiteis identify as Hindus.
Of the state’s projected population of 3.649 million in 2023 (2.856 million in the 2011 census), of whom about 53pc are Meiteis, an estimated 70pc are settled in the Imphal valley, and the remaining 30pc live in areas that belong to the tribal community.
The majority Meiteis inhabiting 10pc of the state’s landmass, coupled with their inability to buy land in the remaining 90pc of tribal protected hill areas, which is declared as belonging Scheduled Tribes, has contributed to their demands to be included in the list of Scheduled Tribes. But their demand is opposed by the tribal community in the state on account of its apparent dominance in terms of population and political representation, with 40 of the 60 lawmakers in the state assembly belonging to the Meitei community.
The United Naga Council argued that the Meiteis are an advanced community in India.

3,"Bilawal, Jaishankar’s exchange termed ‘normal’ for current state of relationship",US scholar Michael Kugelman notes that FM Bilawal appears to have accomplished what Islamabad sought.,"WASHINGTON: While India and Pakistan did not hold bilateral talks on the sidelines of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation foreign ministers’ meeting, their sparring at a multilateral stage has underlined the need for South Asia’s two nuclear powers to stay engaged with each other.
Pakistan did not request, nor did India offer, bilateral talks in Goa, though observers noted these multilateral talks “could lay the groundwork for future interactions between the archrivals,” as a report in the German media outlet DW pointed out.
India strictly maintained a safe distance from the Pakistani delegation, with Minister for External Affairs S. Jaishankar reminding Pakistan not to assume that “we are on the same boat”. But his comments on Pakistan’s alleged involvement in a recent attack in the occupied Jammu and Kashmir and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) showed India still have issues to discuss with Islamabad.
 
 

The Pakistani foreign minister responded to India’s claim by urging New Delhi to undo the merger and resolve the Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions. Mr Bhutto-Zardari later also spoke about CPEC at a joint presser with his Chinese counterpart Qin Gang in Islamabad, saying that the project had accelerated socio-economic development.
In an earlier briefing in Goa, Mr Bhutto-Zardari reminded his Indian counterpart that the issue of terrorism should not be raised for “diplomatic point-scoring”.
These back-and-forth comments on Kashmir, terrorism and CPEC did exactly what India wanted to avoid: raising its problems with Pakistan at a multilateral meeting.
Apparently, that’s why a US scholar of South Asian affairs, Michael Kugelman of Wilson Center, Washington, noted in a tweet that while there was much criticism of the Pakistan FM’s visit to India for SCO, “he appears to have accomplished what Islamabad sought.”
He defined Pakistan’s goals as “participation in the SCO deliberations, and separate sideline meetings with all SCO members except India. Multilateral engagement w-bilats on the side.”
 






In another tweet on Saturday, Mr Kugelman explained why he believed the Pakistan FM accomplished his goal in Goa. “It’s an accomplishment when expectations are as modest as they were. Doubtful he went seeking/expecting a meeting w/Jaishankar.”
 






He described comments by the Pakistani and Indian foreign ministers as “pedestrian stuff”, normal for (such relationships and mostly targeting domestic audiences). Such comments, he wrote, “will have little impact on India-Pak ties.”
Mr Kugelman’s comments, however, irked India’s former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal.
“How is participation and having bilateral meetings with SCO members an accomplishment?” he tweeted. “This is normal in such meetings. Real issue was a possible meeting with the Indian FM which didn’t happen,” he said.

4,Russia’s known writer wounded in car blast,"Zakhar Prilepin is a vocal supporter of Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine, where he fought alongside pro-Russian separatists in 2014.","MOSCOW: In the latest string of attacks blamed on Ukraine and the West, a car explosion wounded one of the Russia’s best-known writers and nationalists, Zakhar Prilepin, and killed another person on Saturday, authorities said.
The explosive device detonated in an Audi Q7 car carrying Mr Prilepin in the Nizhny Novgorod region, said the Russian Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes.
Mr Prilepin is a vocal supporter of Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine, where he fought alongside pro-Russian separatists in 2014. “The famous writer was injured, and the person driving died,” the committee said.
The blast comes on the heels of alleged drone strikes and sabotage attempts in Russia, which is gearing up for the popular May 9 celebrations of the Soviet victory over the Nazis.
It published images of a partly destroyed, overturned car and said the writer had been taken to a medical facility.
The committee opened an investigation for terrorism after the attack, and the interior ministry said it detained a man who “may be involved” in the explosion.
Shortly after the blast, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Ukraine and the West. “Washington and Nato fed another international terrorist cell — the Kyiv regime,” Zakharova said on Telegram. She said the blast was the “direct responsibility of the United States and Britain.”

5,US-Saudi govts hail Jeddah talks for Sudan peace,Around 190 children among 700 killed so far despite multiple efforts to quell fighting.,"

KHARTOUM: The US and Saudi governments confirmed direct talks between the warring Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces would start in Jeddah on Saturday, even as fighting showed little signs of abating in the Sudanese capital.
A joint US-Saudi statement welcomed the “start of pre-negotiation talks” and urged sustained global support to quell fighting.
“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States urge both parties to take in consideration the interests of the Sudanese nation and its people and actively engage in the talks towards a ceasefire and end to the conflict,” the statement said.
Hundreds have died in nearly three weeks of fighting between forces aligned with Sudan’s de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who leads the regular army, and his deputy-turned-rival Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who commands the paramilitary RSF.

Around 190 children among 700 killed so far despite multiple efforts to quell fighting

Multiple truces have been reached since the fighting erupted on April 15, but none has been respected.
The army confirmed late on Friday it had sent envoys to Saudi Arabia to discuss “details of the truce in the process of being extended” with its paramilitary foes.
Burhan had given his backing to a seven-day ceasefire announced by South Sudan on Wednesday, but early on Friday the RSF said they were extending by three days a previous truce brokered under US-Saudi mediation.
The US-Saudi statement noted the efforts of other countries and organisations behind this weekend talks, including Britain, the United Arab Emirates, the League of Arab States, the African Union and other groups.
In Khartoum, witnesses reported continued air strikes and explosions, including near the airport. The fighting raged despite a threat of sanctions from US President Joe Biden against those responsible for “threatening the peace, security, and stability of Sudan” and “undermining Sudan’s democratic transition”.
The north African country suffered decades of sanctions during the rule of autocrat Omar al-Bashir, ousted in a palace coup in 2019 following mass street protests.
“The violence taking place in Sudan is a tragedy — and it is a betrayal of the Sudanese people’s clear demand for civilian government and a transition to democracy. It must end,” Biden said.
Children at risk
The conflict has killed about 700 people so far, mostly in Khartoum and the western Darfur region, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project.
The UN children’s agency, Unicef, earlier on Friday warned, “the situation in Sudan has become fatal for a frighteningly large number of children”. Spokesman James Elder said Unicef had received reports from a trusted partner — not yet independently verified by the United Nations — that 190 children were killed and 1,700 wounded during the first 11 days of the conflict.
He said the figures had been gathered from health facilities in Khartoum and Darfur since April 15, indicating that they only cover children who actually made it to facilities in those areas. “The reality is likely to be much worse,” Elder said.
Aid workers have struggled to get much-needed supplies to areas hit by violence.
According to the International Medical Corps, at least 18 aid workers have been killed amid the fierce urban fighting. The UN Human Rights Council said it would hold a special session next Thursday “to address the human rights impact of the ongoing conflict”.
Earlier, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told a Senate hearing that Washington expected the conflict to continue for a long time. The fighting was “likely to be protracted as both sides believe that they can win militarily, and have few incentives to come to the negotiating table,” she said.
International mediation
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said it was preparing for an outflow of 860,000 people, adding that $445 million would be needed to support them just through October.
Haines said the conflict had exacerbated already dire humanitarian conditions, “raising the spectre of massive refugee flows and aid needs in the region”.
The UN warned that if the fighting continued, it could raise the already large number of Sudanese threatened by hunger and malnutrition by as many as 2.5m.
“That raises the number to a total of 19m people in the next three to six months,” said Farhan Haq, a spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres.
Mediation efforts have multiplied since the conflict began.
Burhan’s envoy Dafaallah al-Haj, speaking from the Ethiopian capital, vowed that “shortly the government of Sudan is going to put an end to this rebellion”, referring to the RSF.
After a joint coup in October 2021 that upended a fragile transition to civilian rule, Burhan and Daglo have engaged in a power struggle — most recently over the RSF’s integration into the regular army — which has now flared into bloody violence.
