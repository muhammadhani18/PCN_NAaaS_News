0,Preventive measures afoot as dengue cases start surfacing in KP,Officials say they need early release of emergency fund to buy essential items.,"PESHAWAR: The health department has started taking preventive measures against Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever as cases of the disease have begun to emerge in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Officials told this scribe that they were waiting for emergency fund to ensure procurement of essential items as early as possible because the hot and humid season was approaching during which cases could swell.
So far 19 confirmed dengue patients have been recorded in the province with Mardan reporting 10 cases, Peshawar and Bajaur three each and Kohat, Chitral Lower and Bannu districts one each case. Two of the patients had travel history to Saudi Arabia.
Officials said that the chief secretary approved a request by the health department for release of the Rs171 million funds to augment the preparations and save the situation from going last year’s way when the disease infected more than 23,000 people and killed 18 of them.

Officials say they need early release of emergency fund to buy essential items

Last year, the government had sanctioned Rs275 million emergency funds for prevention of the outbreak of the mosquitoes-borne aliment in August but only Rs104 million was released by the finance department and the rest of 171 million was not released.
Officials said that health department had spent half of the 104 million because it had been released in August when the disease was heading towards peak season. However, they said that the chief secretary had directed for release of the reaming amount as procurement had been started.
“We have already buffer stock of larvicides, which can be used to take preventive measures but the department requires release of the emergency money left over from last year. In case of upswing in cases, we would need more money,” officials in health secretariat told Dawn.
They said that as no emergency was declared in the province, therefore, all the procurements would be made as per normal procedure that took at least three months. “In order to strengthen preparatory work, we need the amount to ensure full-scale anti-dengue activities including public awareness, surveillance and monitoring and case diagnosis and management,” they added.
Meanwhile, a district health officer in one of the high-risk areas told Dawn that the health department was required to pay the amount to the staffers, who had already spent on fuel and other activities from their own pockets. “The chief secretary has recently chaired a meeting of administrative secretaries wherein he has categorically directed them to adopt multisectoral approach to ensure prevention of the ailment,” he added.
He said that they demanded of the local government, education and other departments to play their part in prevention of the outbreak of the disease. He added that the recent rains had left pools of stagnant water, which needed to be sprayed because those were potential breeding sites for mosquitoes, the transmitters of the disease.
“Similarly, education department should start awareness sessions in morning assemblies in schools to scale up students’ knowledge about the causes of dengue and its prevention,” said the district health officer.
He feared that cases would surge next month if they failed to take preventive measures, especially elimination of standing water pools and urging the people not to store water in open pots so the mosquitoes’ production could be stopped.
Physicians at the hospitals say that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been home to the vector-borne sickness for the past few years mainly due to delayed allocation of funds, which hampers steps to prevent its outbreak.
Training of doctors and other professionals to ensure effective surveillance and investigation of suspected people and management of the cases at hospitals is in progress but early procurement is most important because cases rise during July to September.
The Dengue Action Plan 2023 has already been approved. The plan is meant to ensure prevention of the disease as well as manage the infected patients.

3,LB chairmen threaten protests over ‘denial’ of uplift funds,Call on caretaker govt to release Rs42 billion in development funds.,"MANSEHRA: Chairmen of the village and neighbourhood councils here on Saturday demanded of the caretaker government to release Rs42 billion development funds earmarked by its predecessor for local governments across the province.
They warned that if their demand wasn’t met, they would stage street protests across the district.
“Almost a year has passed since the local governments were installed in the province but no funds have been provided to them. The Supreme Court chief justice should take a suo motu notice of this matter to order payments by the government,” chairman of the Lassan Thakral village council Malik Mumtaz told a meeting of local body heads here.
Mr Mumtaz said both federal and provincial governments were not sincere about the people’s welfare.
He said if Rs42 billion earmarked by the previous PTI government were released, the work on development projects that had been suspended since last year would resume.
Chairman of the Safada village council Basharat Ali Swati told the meeting that if the development funds were not released within a week, the local body heads would stage street protests against the government across the province.
“Local body elections were held in the province on the orders of the Supreme Court but unfortunately, the successive governments denied development funds and other perks to the elected councils,” he said.
The participants also demanded an inquiry into the alleged corruption in the recent distribution of free flour in the district by the government.
“If the chairman of Mansehra tehsil council makes any attempt to impose a presiding officer of his choice by bulldozing the LG Act, we [local body members] will resist move as majority of the council members wants free and fair elections for the office,” said councillor Nasira Bibi, who was elected on a seat reserved for women.
Ms Bibi said that the Election Commission of Pakistan should hold election to the office of the tehsil council presiding officer in accordance with the LG Act.
UNPAID FOR MONTHS: Contractual teachers of the Girls Degree College, Oghi, haven’t received salary for the last 10 months.
“The government has appointed teachers to the only degree college for girls in the tehsil almost a year ago to address the shortage of faculty members but they are still unpaid,” former councillor of the Oghi union council Mohammad Haroon told reporters on Saturday.
Mr Haroon, who led a group of locals, said that the teachers, who were appointed on the contractual basis and had yet to receive salary, would boycott classes causing a learning loss to students.
“We took up this issue with authorities for action, but to no avail,” he said.
The former councillor said record inflation had hit government employees, who received fixed salaries, really hard and that if the prices of essential goods weren’t controlled, they would quit their jobs.
He said the caretaker chief minister should take notice of the matter and ensure the payment of salaries to the contractual college teachers.

5,Farmers seek compensation for rain-hit  wheat crop,"SWABI: Ittehad Kashtkaran, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday demanded of both the federal and provincial governments to...","SWABI: Ittehad Kashtkaran, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday demanded of both the federal and provincial governments to provide financial assistance to the farmers, whose harvested wheat crop has been extensively damaged during the recent rains and hailstorms.
The demand was made at a meeting of the forum held here.
The participants said the government claimed agriculture was the backbone of Pakistan’s economy, but took no practical steps to uplift the lot of farmers, especially when their crops were hit by natural calamities. They said the growers were seriously thinking about quitting the farming and switching to other income-generating sources.
On the occasion, Arif Ali Khan, the forum’s central president, said last year the flash floods washed away the standing maize crop and hailstones damaged sugarcane, tobacco and vegetable crops, while rains and hailstones had damaged the harvested wheat crop this year. He said while farmers were in hot waters, the rulers had no time to provide relief to them.
Daud Khan, the forum’s senior vice-president, said the United Nations provided assistance to those countries having been badly affected by the climate change phenomenon, but Pakistani rulers had failed to sensitise the world community to the massive effects of climate change on the country’s farming community to get financial support for them.
Iqbal Shewa, vice-president of the farmers’ body, said poor farmers won’t survive in present period of economic difficulties.
SUICIDE: Akhtar Khan, 20, a resident of Maneri Bala village, committed suicide on Saturday, the police said.
SHO Swabi city police station Ajab Durrani said Mohammad Shirab Khan, father of the deceased, told them the deceased went inside a room and shot himself in the abdomen. He said he was taken to the District Headquarters Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. 
The complainant told the police the deceased had clashed with the family in the morning over some issue.
Meanwhile, a 13-year-old boy, son of Sher Ali Khan, drowned in Pehur High Level Canal while bathing with his friends on Saturday.
Later, divers retrieved his body and handed him over to family.

“Our teams are searching for the body, but flooding in the river hampers our efforts,” Amir Khadam, an official of Rescue 1122, told reporters.
Three Afghan boys were playing at the riverside when the water flow in the river suddenly swelled amid heavy rains and swept them away.

High-altitude parts of Kaghan valley, Babusar Top, Barawai, Musa Da Musalla and Malka-i-Parbat continued to receive snowfall, turning the weather cold.
The Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road, which links Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with Gilgit-Baltistan via Kaghan valley, couldn’t be reopened to traffic as its portions, which were blocked following snow avalanches last week, couldn’t be cleared as yet owing to rough weather.
The arrival of nomads to the upper parts of Kaghan valley, which usually begins in the last week of April, has been delayed because of blockade of the MNJ Road due to continued rains and snowfall.

The campaign will end by June 30.
The caretaker Punjab government has released the amount to Wasa in March and directed to start the work. The government wanted to complete the work without any further delay.
Wasa spokesman Umer Farooq told  Dawn on Friday that the agency would spend Rs30 million to clear the obstacles in the nullah to avoid flood like situation in the coming monsoon.
He said that there were reports that the coming monsoon will be aggressive and there was a dire need to remove the mud and any other obstacle in the smooth flow of rainwater coming from the capital city and adjoining nullahs.
He said that the drive started in May and it would be completed by end of June. He said that the dredging would improve the water flow up to two feet. He said that the target would be achieved within stipulated timeline.

The SP sustained a head injury and was immediately removed to the emergency ward where he was given first aid and later different medical tests were conducted. After his condition was described as stable and out of danger, he was allowed to go home.
A police spokesman said that a grand operation was started late at night in the areas located around the Holy Family and 33 people were detained in connection with firing in the air and fireworks display. 
The police claimed the accused resisted the police and fired at the police to avoid arrest.
During the raid, one Kalashnikov, one 12-bore rifle, two pistols along with bullets and cartridges were recovered from the accused, the police said, claiming fireworks and ‘liquor bottles’ were also recovered from the accused.
CPO Syed Khalid Mahmood Hamdani said, “Those people who play with the lives of citizens for their temporary pleasure cannot escape from the grip of the law.” Rawal Faisal Saleem’s health is now improving and he is undergoing treatment, said the CPO.
It may be mentioned here that jubilation fire in the garrison city has claimed the lives of innocent people and left many injured in the past. 
Ahead of Eid, the Nur Khan Air Base authorities also asked the police and district administration to impose Section 144 and launch a search operation in the surrounding areas of the base to curb firing in the air.

17,Rankers in Islamabad police ‘deprived’ of due promotion,Only one ex-cadre officer appointed as 14 seats reserved for rankers remain vacant,"ISLAMABAD: The ex-cadre officers of the capital police are being deprived of their due right of promotion, as instead of promoting them against the vacant seats in the capital police, concerned authorities have been deputing officers from other departments.
Due to the violation of rights to promotion, 14 seats reserved for the ex-cadre officers out of 15 were left vacant. Officers of the capital police told Dawn that there were 38 seats from grade-18 (Superintendent of Police) to grade-21 (Inspector General of Police).
As per the quota, 15 seats are reserved for rankers while the remaining seats are meant for the Police Services of Pakistan (PSP), they added. Out of the 15 seats, there was only one officer of the SP rank in the capital police, they said, adding that the capital police had 20 seats for the grade-18 officers, and out of the total, 11 were occupied by PSPs.
Regarding the 18 other seats from grade-19 (SSP) to grade-21, at least 11 were occupied by PSPs, including an SSP whose encadrement in the PSP group was made by the establishment division from the ex-cadre group earlier after a year of his promotion to grade-18.

Only one ex-cadre officer appointed as 14 seats reserved for rankers remain vacant

An officer cannot be promoted from grade-18 to grade-19 (SSP) until his encadrement is made in the PSP group, they said, adding that after one year of promotion to grade-18 (SP), the IGP is required to recommend these officers to the establishment division for induction into the PSP group.
Meanwhile, the 15 seats reserved for the ex-cadre officers cannot be given to the PSP officers in any case, they said, adding that the eligible officers would be promoted to grade-18 (SP) from grade-17 (DSP) by a promotion board constituted by the interior ministry. In light of Police Order 2002, the police chief can also promote eligible officers to vacant seats, they added.
The last promotion of ex-cadre officers to grade-18 took place in 2021, they said adding that recently, two SPs from the PSP group were transferred to the capital police; both were from the Pakistan Railways and after reaching grade-18, the establishment division made their encadrement in the PSP group.
Currently, only one ex-cadre officer of grade-18 is working in the capital police, they said, adding that last month one ex-cadre SP Tahir Khan was transferred to Balochistan on deputation, while the rest of the 13 seats reserved for rankers were either vacant or given to the PSPs in violation of the quota system. On some seats, DSPs were working via shoulder promotion.
SP Tahir Khan was transferred to Balochistan on deputation by the establishment division at the request of the IGP, despite the fact that he was not a PSP officer, they said. The IGP made SP Khan a scapegoat to save his skin along with the DIG Operations and SSP CTD after the quarters concerned expressed displeasure for not getting the desired result in a case registered against PTI leaders in connection with violence outside the judicial complex on March 18.
The officers said that despite the availability of eligible officers, quota, and seats, the procedure to promote the grade-17 officers to grade-18 is yet to be initiated, adding that five DSPs are given shoulder promotions despite rulings of the SC. The word ‘officiating’ is used to give the five officers the rank of SP, keeping in view of the SC ruling against the shoulder promotion, the officers said.
Besides, there were 50 seats for grade-17 officers in the capital -- 41 for DSPs (ex-cadres) and nine for ASPs (Assistant Superintendents of Police), the officers said, adding that out of the total 41 seats, as many as 12 DSP seats were laying vacant, besides, some inspectors are also working on the DSP seats too.
Despite the availability of the eligible officers, the procedure has yet to start for the promotion of a grade-16 officer (inspector) to a grade-17 (DSP), they said, adding that however, the IGP Islamabad brought two DSPs from the Punjab police on deputation.
Former DSP Legal Azhar Shah, talking to Dawn, said that as per the Federal Services Act 1973, a 40 per cent quota was reserved for ex-cadres and a 60 per cent quota was reserved for the PSPs. PSPs cannot be appointed on the quota reserved for rankers, he added.
As per the Services Rules, an officer of the Federal Service (CSS) could be appointed or transferred anywhere in Pakistan, the retired DSP said, adding that SP Khan was an officer of Islamabad, having a status of a province, but he was not an officer of the federal.
The rule of transfer on deputation – as per Estacode transfers on deputation can only be made through the process of selection – was violated in SP Khan’s case, as the demand of the officer from Balochistan by the province’s IGP and the selection procedure were not mentioned in the notification issued by the establishment division, the former police officer, who is now a high court lawyer, added.
When contacted, Police Publication Branch head DIG Headquarters Awais Ahmed replied that these were policy issues and only the IGP could reply. Jawad Taqi is PRO, he replied when asked if he was not the in-charge of the PPB. PRO Jawad Taqi was also approached for comments, but he did not reply. The IGP was also not available for comments despite attempts.
