• China assures continued support for Pakistan’s economic stability
ISLAMABAD: At “productive” trilateral talks on Saturday, Pakistan and China assured Afghan­istan of their cooperation so that the conflict-torn country begins its journey towards stability.
The fact that the Chinese foreign minister visited Pakistan shows Islamabad and Beijing’s keen interest to ensure peace and prosperity in the region. The development attains significance when seen in the backdrop of China’s role as Beijing has recently successfully worked to bring bitter rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia closer.
On the bilateral front, Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari appreciated China’s “principled and just stance” on the issue of India-held Kash­mir and hailed Beijing’s support for Islamabad.
At the 5th Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialo­gue, Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and his Chinese and Afghan counterparts Qin Gang and Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, respectively, held productive discussion on matters of mutual interest, including political engagement, counter-terrorism, trade and connectivity.
Mr Muttaqi has been subjected to travel bans, asset freezes, and arms embargoes under the Sec­u­rity Council sanctions for a long time. A UN Sec­u­rity Council committee agreed on May 1 to allow him to travel during May 6-9 for the meeting on a req­uest from Pakistan’s UN mission, diplomats said.
The trilateral dialogue was followed by the 4th round of Sino-Pak strategic dialogue.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari while speaking at a joint stakeout with Mr Qin after the strategic dialogue stressed that peace and stability in Afghanistan remained vital for the socioeconomic development, connectivity and prosperity of the region.
“We will continue to work together with all sta­k­eholders for peaceful, stable, prosperous and united Afghanistan,” he said.
The foreign minister said engagement with the Afghan authorities was must and it was their consistent message to them ‘help us help you.’
He said unlocking Afghanistan’s potential is crucial for the benefit of its people, and that achieving stability and peace in the country is essential.
He said the core issue and red line was terrorism, which posed a serious threat to regional peace and was a stumbling block in the way of prosperity for the Afghan people.
He said that during his recent SCO-CFM meetings in India, they discussed different projects within the framework of SCO including CASA, Trans-Afghan railways, but all these projects hinged upon addressing the security issues in Afghanistan.
One-China policy
While referring to the long-standing ties between Pakistan and China, he said the two countries had been supporting each other for decades and would continue to do so in the decades to come.
The minister reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for China on all its core issues, including the One-China policy, Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and the South China Sea.
“We are committed to remaining engaged with China to promote south-south cooperation, especially in light of emerging global concerns like human-induced climate change,” he added.
The minister termed Pakistan-China friendship as irreversible, ‘a historic reality and a consensus choice of the two nations’.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari also expressed gratitude to the Chinese leadership for its generous and timely assistance as their country was facing the meltdown effects of the global economy.
He termed CPEC ‘a win-win economic initiative, open to all investors around the world’.
He said CPEC remains a shining example of the Belt and Road cooperation, which spurred socioeconomic development, job creation and improvement in the livelihoods of the people of Pakistan.
Chine reaffirms support
Mr Qin assured that that China will continue to support Pakistan in maintaining foreign exchange and financial stability, especially during challenges like geopolitical conflicts, international turbulence, and natural disasters.
The visiting dignitary said China will always support Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and national dignity. He said China firmly supports Pakistan in exploring a development path compatible with its national conditions.
He praised Pakistan’s significant sacrifices in the fight against terrorism and expressed his firm belief in Islamabad’s ultimate victory in counter-terrorism operations.
He stated that both sides had agreed to hold the perpetrators of terrorism against Chinese workers in Pakistan accountable and to deepen their security cooperation.
Mr Qin said both sides expressed satisfaction with the progress made on projects under the CPEC.
“We also agreed to expedite major projects, including ML-1 and the Gwadar port,” he added.
He stated that the leadership in China encourages Chinese companies to invest in Pakistan and welcomes high-quality products from Pakistan into China.
He emphasised the importance of exploring new areas of cooperation in agriculture and energy.
The foreign minister reiterated that China and Pakistan were committed to an even closer partnership and building a shared future as all-weather strategic and cooperative partners in the new era.
He highlighted the importance of the strong and enduring friendship between Pakistan and China, which was built on a shared history and the consensus of the people of both countries.
Mr Qin appreciated Pakistan’s support on issues of China’s interest and major concerns. He also mentioned that commercial flights between Pakistan and China have been restored to pre-pandemic levels and that the China-Pakistan joint exhibition of Gandhara art at the Palace Museum in Beijing was popular among the Chinese people.
He emphasised the need to explore new areas of cooperation in agriculture and energy, and reiterated the commitment of both countries to strengthen their strategic and cooperative partnership.
He stated that President Xi Jinping has proposed Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilisation Initiative, which provide Chinese solutions and proposals to the world. He mentioned that both countries have agreed to prioritise the implementation of these initiatives. He also stated that they are against the mentality of the Cold War and bloc confrontation.
Mr Qin said that the all-weather cooperation and friendship between the two countries had been forged by history and consensus. He noted that the increasingly fortified and deepened cooperation between the two countries was contributing to global peace and development.
Referring to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit, he said frequent interactions between the two countries would strengthen strategic cooperation.
In response to a question about the China-Pakistan-Afghanistan talks, he stated that the dialogue would help uphold peace and stability in the region.
He expressed China’s readiness to support Afghanistan in its economic reconstruction and expressed the hope that the interim Afghan government would embrace inclusive governance and moderate policies while maintaining friendly relations with its neighbours.
He also urged the international community to take concrete actions to help the Afghan people and alleviate their sufferings.
During the 4th round of strategic dialogue co-chaired by the two foreign ministers, they welcomed the completion of a decade of CPEC in 2023 and hailed CPEC as a shining example of Belt and Road cooperation that has accelerated socio-economic development, job creation, and improved people’s livelihoods in Pakistan.
Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the high-quality development of CPEC and expressed satisfaction with the steady progress of CPEC projects.

1,"Imran plans more rallies, warns against breach of SC order",Takes a dig at Indian FM over remarks about Bilawal; questions utility of PM’s visit to London,"LAHORE: PTI Chairman Imran Khan on Saturday announced that his party would organise rallies from next week till May 14 to demand elections, as more than half of the country’s population was without representation.
“Do not forget that if the Sup­reme Court gets defied, the Consti­tution would collapse. It means the end of the rule of law and the beginning of law of the jungle. We would not let it happen,” Mr Khan warned.
Addressing a rally in Lahore staged to express solidarity with judiciary, the former prime minister said, “I will organise jalsas (rallies) from next week; will start from here [Lahore] and by May 14, will lead rallies up to Attock. I will go out in public and prepare people…to demand elections.”
The rally lasted less than two hours and featured a ten-minute speech by Mr Khan. “I am on the roads now. Come join me for the sake of posterity. The country is in the throes of deep crises: six soldiers were martyred a day before yesterday, seven teachers got gunned down…and inflation has shot through the roof,” the PTI chairman told his supporters.

Takes a dig at Indian FM over remarks about Bilawal; questions utility of PM’s visit to London

In the middle of these existential crises, what is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif doing in the UK, he questioned. “The premier is there because his wealth is stashed away in Britain. His kids are abroad. This country is only a ruling pastime for the family,” he claimed, before going on to blame former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa for imposing the current rulers on Pakistan.
“No one has damaged the country more than Bajwa,” Imran Khan insisted in his brief speech, delivered from his bomb-proof vehicle.
He also took a dig at the Indian foreign minister, S Jaishankar, for his remarks about Foreign Minister Baliwal Bhutto-Zardari. “Have Indians forgotten all diplomatic mannerisms and etiquettes? You either do not invite people or you do not misbehave with them. Though the Indian attitude leaves much to be desired, Pakistan’s foreign minister should have calculated the cost-benefit ratio before embarking on this diplomatically risky journey,” Mr Khan added.
“The PTI will lift Pakistan out of the current mess to make it a powerful and respected country by ensuring the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law. In order to achieve that goal, I am out on the streets. Come and join me. Join me for the sake of the next generations.”
“I am on the roads despite verifiable threats to life. I have already escaped an assassination attempt once. On the second occasion, I was able to sniff out murder planning,” the PTI chairman claimed and accused a senior intelligence official of orchestrating plans to murder him.
“Despite these murder plans, I am protesting on the roads for the sake of this country. It is your duty to join me because it is not politics but jehad: fight for real freedom is never politics,” Mr Khan claimed.
On Friday, the Punjab government allowed a rally from Zaman Park to Lakshmi Chowk rally – a 4.5-kilometre route – between 2pm to 7.30pm.
The admin had promised to facilitate the rally on certain conditions, like avoiding speeches against the judiciary and the military – a condition Imran Khan violated by directly naming a serving general.
The police party took measures to keep the route safe by blocking all exit and entry points till the end of the rally after 6:20pm. The PTI official social media claimed that rallies at 4,000 different points were taken out on Saturday. It kept streaming footage from Rawalpindi and Islamabad and other places.

2,King Charles III crowned in Britain’s first coronation since 1953,"Shehbaz, other world leaders attend lavish ceremony","

LONDON: Charles III was crowned monarch of the United Kingdom and 14 Common­wealth realms on Saturday at Britain’s first coronation for 70 years, during a ceremony steeped in a millennium of ritual and spectacle.
Charles, 74, became the oldest sovereign yet to be crowned at London’s Westminster Abbey after a lifetime as heir to his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II. At 12:02pm local time (5:02pm PST), Archb­i­shop of Canterbury Justin Welby placed the solid-gold St Edw­ard’s Crown on Charles’s head as a sacred and ancient sym­­bol of the monarch’s authority.
Welby also crowned Charles’s wife, Camilla, 75, capping a remarkable transformation from her role as royal mistress to queen consort and now queen.
Cries of “God Save the King” rang out from the 2,300-member congregation, which included royalty and government leaders from worldwide.

Shehbaz, other world leaders attend lavish ceremony

Trumpet fanfare sounded at Westminster Abbey, along with gun salutes across Britain and beyond.
Returning to Buckingham Palace in the day’s second horse-drawn parade, the royal family appeared on the balcony to applause and more chants of approbation from tens of thousands of well-wishers braving a spring downpour.
Some had camped out for days. A ceremonial fly-past was scaled down due to the weather.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also joined a galaxy of foreign royals, officials and heads of the states and governments at the coronation.
The premier, who arrived at the Westminster Abbey along with other foreign dignitaries, met different world leaders on the sidelines, including the presidents of Brazil, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Zambia, Mauritius, Malta, the secretary general of Commonwealth, and UK Minister of State (Development and Africa) Andrew Mitchell.
On Twitter, Mr Sharif said that during his address at the Commonwealth leaders’ meeting on Friday, he made a case for reenergising Commonwealth with a focus on youth empowerment.
“I shared with the world leaders the details of our Youth Programme that is based on four Es: Education, Employment, Engagement and Environment. Women and members of minority communities are a special focus of the loan scheme,” he tweeted on Saturday.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said that during the Friday event, Mr Sharif had extended an invitation to King Charles to visit Pakistan.
Changes
King Charles pledged “I come not to be served but to serve” during the Anglican service, much of which would have been recognisable to the 39 other monarchs crowned at Westminster Abbey since William the Conqueror in 1066.
But while many of the intricate rituals and ceremony to recognise Charles as his people’s “undoubted king” remained, the sovereign sought to bring other aspects of the service up to date.
Female bishops and choristers participated for the first time, as did leaders of Britain’s non-Christian faiths, while its Celtic languages — Welsh, Scottish Gaelic and Irish Gaelic — featured prominently.
As king, Charles is the supreme governor of the Protestant Church of England and has described himself as a “committed Anglican Christian”.
But key elements of the service recognised that Charles heads a more religiously and ethnically diverse country than the one his mother inherited in the shadow of World War II.
In another change, the coronation themes mirrored his lifelong interest in biodiversity and sustainability.
Ceremonial vestments from previous coronations were reused, and the anointing oil — created from olives on groves on the Mount of Olives and perfumed with essential oils — was vegan.
Charles was anointed out of sight of the congregation behind a three-sided screen in front of the abbey’s High Altar, to the strains of Handel’s soaring anthem “Zadok the Priest”, sung at every coronation since 1727.

3,Polls only in Punjab not in Pakistan’s interest: PM,"Premier meets Nawaz in London, says all provinces are equal and elections will take place on a single day."," 

LONDON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif meets Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland on the sidelines of the coronation, on Saturday.—Online

LONDON: Prime Minis­ter Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said elections in the country will take place on the same day.
Speaking to reporters after meeting his brother, the party’s supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, at Stanhope House, the premier said, “Elections will happen on one day. In Punjab in the past there was a wrong impression that it is the big brother of the provinces. All provinces are equal. Only doing an election in Punjab is not in Pakistan’s interest.”
 






Mr Shehbaz met his brother after attending the coronation ceremony of King Charles, where he also interacted with leaders of other Commonwealth nations.
He said, “Parliament’s constitutional rights will be protected, and parliament has one voice on this matter. There is no doubt that parliament within its limits will assert its authority”.
He hit out at ex-chief justice Saqib Nisar. “The former chief justice played a central role in disqualifying Mian Nawaz Sharif on baseless allegations. Day and night he would use suo motu, but was any case of his in the public interest? He was only doing it to make Imran Khan successful. He behaved not as the CJP but as an agent of PTI.”
 






He added that the purported audio leak of the former judge’s son shows that “there was a conspiracy to bring IK to power”.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz said that for the previous PTI government everything, including the conduct of interstate relations, was a plaything, adds APP.
Reacting strongly to the PTI leadership’s attempt to create controversy over Pakistan’s participation in the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in India, the prime minister on his Twitter handle, said it was deeply troubling how the PTI had tried to generate a controversy around Pakistan’s participation.
“It shouldn’t be surprising though as Imran Niazi has had no qualms about imperiling the country’s vital foreign policy interests in the past too. This is what they did when they were in power. For the PTI, everything including the conduct of interstate relations is a plaything,” the tweet read.
 






Separately, Information Minister Aurangzeb said PTI chief Imran Khan should not worry about next fiscal year’s budget as “the facility of getting selected was no more available and the facilitators had also gone”.
The [PTI] government which destroyed economy, and caused unprecedented inflation and unemployment for four years will never come to power again, she alleged.

4,"Situationer: Convoluted saga of recording, leaking conversations","The game of recording audio — and in selective cases, even leaking them — is played by both civilian and military sides.","Over the past few months, elections are probably the only issue that dominated the political discourse more than leaked audio clips. With politicians, apparently, at the receiving end, there have been widespread concerns over who’s snooping on these conversations and how they are coming out.
The second part is easier to answer. Most of these conversations were leaked on Twitter. Anonymous accounts first give a forewarning that a conversation is about to be leaked. Then comes the bombshell — a video with a black background and green soundwaves with subjects’ pictures. Captions are also added to them for easier comprehension.
Now comes the trickier part of the question. Who is recording them? The answer could be anyone’s guess. While many suspect it to be the handiwork of spy agencies, some also blame professional hackers. The saga gets further convoluted as all spy agencies, without the distinction of civil or military have the ability and the legal cover to pry on the conversations.
Editorial: It is high time an investigation homed in on the culprits behind audio leaks
A report submitted before the Supreme Court in 2015 stated that the army’s Inter-Services Intelli­gence and Military Intelligence and civilian Intelligence Bureau and police have the power to tap phone calls under Section 24 of the Telecommunication Act, 1996; Section 5 of the Telegraph Act, 1885 and Investigation for Fair Trial Act, 2013. Additionally, cellular companies, under the clause of “legal interference” in their licence, are bound to share phone call data with law enforcement agencies if required.

Civil, mly agencies and police could listen to phone calls; politicians are ‘the disproportionate target’

Under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, intruding on the privacy of an individual through electronic means is a serious offence. Section 21 of the law states that the use of electronic means to cause reputational damage or breach privacy could land a person in prison for up to seven years or up to a Rs5 million fine.
Politicians ‘the victims’
Yet these conversations are recorded and leaked, with politicians apparently the disproportionate target of these leaked conversations. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PTI chief Imran Khan, former Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Pervez Elahi, former finance minister Shaukat Tarin, KP’s ex-finance minister Taimur Jhagra are a few names on this unwanted list.
The conversations of the family members of some politically-exposed persons have also surfaced. A recent leak purportedly was of a conversation featuring the mother-in-law of Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial. Another purportedly featured the ex-CJP Saqib Nisar’s son.
According to PTI leader Maleeka Bukhari, the audios are being leaked systematically with politicians “the sole target”.
She added that under the law, intelligence agencies can record audio but with the permission of the relevant court.
“I am against maligning politicians through such tactics and in case PTI will form its government I will make efforts to curb this menace,” said Ms Bokhari, who served as the minister for state on law and justice during the previous PTI government.
Interestingly, when Mr Khan was the prime minister, he defended the ISI’s powers to record phone calls and even justified the bugging of the PM’s Office. However, during a recent interaction with the court reporters, he said that he never defended the breach of privacy rights.
The purpose of these leaked conversations is also questionable as they have no legal standing in any court of law, thanks to the parameters chalked out by the former CJP Asif Saeed Khan Khosa. In the case pertaining to the leaked videos of former accountability judge Arshad Malik, the ex-CJP set tough standards for the admissibility of electronic evidence.
Talking to Dawn, former chief justice Saqib Nisar said that he heard a case of phone tapping and also set some parameters for using these conversations as evidence. He said he also summoned relevant officials and worked out the restrictions for phone tapping to protect privacy.
Since the hearing was in-camera, the ex-CJP said he could not divulge more details.
The ‘sordid’ history
The history of Pakistan has seen numerous instances in which leaked call recordings stirred a political story. Most were in the time when telephones were the only source of communication. Some believed that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was the first prime minister to have ordered the ISI to tap the phones of his political opponents after protests broke out against his government in 1977.
In 1996, tapping phones was one of the reasons for the ouster of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. The then chief justice, Sajjad Ali Shah took suo motu notice after he found that his phone was bugged. Later, during the proceedings of a case against Ms Bhutto’s ouster, the counsel of former president Farooq Ahmed Leghari justified his client’s actions by stating that Ms Bhutto’s government was taping the phones of Supreme Court judges.
In 2001, the sitting judge of Lahore High Court, Justice Malik Qayyum, had to resign after his audio recordings with Shehbaz Sharif  surfaced.
In 2015, late Senator Mushahidullah Khan referred to an audio tape of former ISI DG Lt Gen Zaheerul Islam recorded by the IB. In the audio clip, Lt Gen Islam could be heard inciting PTI’s protestors to take over the PM House during the party’s sit-in of 2014, as per Mr Khan’s claims who added that the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had played it to the then ex-COAS Gen Raheel Sharif.
All in on it
The game of recording audio — and in selective cases, even leaking them — is played by both civilian and military sides.
An IB official said spy agencies, his own, have the resources to record audio conversations. However, he claimed that spy agencies never use their resources to breach the privacy of citizens as recording gadgets were purchased from the taxpayers’ money and to be used for national security purposes.
According to an official of a spy agency, provincial governments have also acquired the equipment for tapping phone calls. He said that since intelligence agencies are capable of recording audio, therefore, they provide it to the government.
The military’s spokesperson did not respond when Dawn contacted him for comments.
Some of these conversations are even acquired from cellular networks. A senior official of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority said they have no oversight on service providers if they share data with intelligence agencies.
Some spy agencies official Dawn talked to also hinted at the involvement of novice hackers who have bugged people’s devices using inexpensive software and applications available online. But cyber security experts say these carefully curated leaks bear the signs of a systematic campaign and not of any immature sleuth. They say civil and military commands are capable of managing this.
There are several steps an individual could take to avoid any intrusion and subsequent bugging. Cyber security experts suggest users to not click on any link coming from an un-trusted source or hand over their cell phones to any stranger.
