• ROs reject 12.5pc of 25,951 nomination papers
• Fafen asks ECP to be transparent with rejection decisions
ISLAMABAD: Retur­ning Officers (ROs) appo­inted for the Feb 8 elections have rejected around 12.5 per cent of nomination papers submitted by the candidates from across the country for the national and provincial assemblies.
An analysis of the statistics about the nomination papers accepted and rejected by ROs and released by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) reveals that almost one-eighth of the papers were rejected.
In all, 25,951 papers had been filed for the 859 general seats of national and provincial assemblies, out of which 3,240 (12.49pc) were rejected by the ROs.
Out of the total 7,473 nomination papers filed for the 266 general seats of the National Assembly, 1,024 (13.70pc) papers were rejected. Thus 6,094 men and 355 women are now left in the field for the NA constituencies. How­ever, the situation is likely to change as the process of filing of appeals, that started on Monday and will continue till Jan 3, may result in some of the hopefuls coming back to the arena.
The highest ratio of rej­ec­tions — 45pc — was seen in the federal capital, where 93 nominations out of the total 209 stood rejected.
Among the provinces, the highest proportion of rejections for the NA’s general seats Balochistan tops with 14.58pc. Out of the 631 papers filed in the province, 92 were rejected by the ROs.
In Punjab, 3,621 nomination papers were filed against the NA’s general seats, out of which 521 (14.39pc) were rejected.
 
 

In Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, 152 (11.42pc) out of the total 1,331, while in Sindh 166 (9.88pc) of the total 1,681 nomination papers were rejected.
Provincial assemblies
For 593 seats of the four provincial assemblies, 18,478 aspirants had submitted their nominations, out of which 2,216 (11.99pc) have been rejected.
The rejection level remained highest in Balochistan as far as nominations for the general seats of provincial assemblies are concerned.
In Balochistan, a total of 1,788 nomination papers had been filed, out of which 386 (21.59pc) have been rejected. A total of 520 (12.11pc) nominations out of 4,294 in Sindh, 367 (10.60pc) out of 3,461 in KP and 943 (10.55pc) out of 8,935 papers in Punjab have been rejected.
As many as 22,711 validly nominated candidates are left in the run for the general seats of National Assembly and four provincial assemblies, after clearing the scrutiny phase.
They include 6,449 aspirants for the National Assembly and 16,262 hopefuls for provincial assemblies.
 
 

The ROs declared nominations of 15,590 male and 672 female candidates as valid and their total number for PAs stands at 16,262.
Hence, nomination papers of a total of 21,684 male candidates were declared valid, including 6,094 for NA, whereas a total of 1,027 female aspirants are now left in the electoral arena, including 355 for NA and 672 for PA seats.
Appellate tribunals
Under the law, those declared invalid for Feb 8 elections have the option to move the appellate tribunals appointed in the federal capital and the four provinces for the possible relief.
The ratio of rejection is slightly higher than the 2018 general elections, but lower than the 2013 polls. In 2018 and 2013, 10.4pc and 14.6pc of nomination papers were rejected during the scrutiny process, respectively.
Though details of the nominations accepted and rejected in 2018 is not available on the ECP’s website, a report about the 2013 elections shows that Sindh was on top in terms of the ratio of rejected nominations, both for the national and provincial assembly seats, coming to 19.33pc and 20.47pc, respectively.
Fafen’s call
In a related development, the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) urged the ECP to publish the ROs’ decisions about objections to nominations and rejections of nomination papers on its website, noting that it will contribute to a more informed discourse and strengthen electoral transparency. Section 62(11) of the Elections Act, 2017 requires the ROs to endorse their decision on each nomination paper, either accepting or rejecting it, and in the case of rejection or objection to acceptance, record brief reasons for their decisions.
Although the Elections Act, 2017 does not contain any specific provisions that warrant publication of such decisions, Fafen believes that Section 4(3) empowers the ECP with expansive authority to undertake any measures necessary to fulfil its constitutional mandate of conducting elections honestly, justly, fairly, and in accordance with the law, while safeguarding against corrupt practices. “By sharing ROs’ decisions, the ECP will empower citizens to comprehend the reasons behind these decisions, and encourage informed opinions about the electoral process.
“This measure will not only reinforce the transparency of the electoral process, but also serve as a safeguard to its credibility against the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation that often stems from incomplete information,” Fafen said in a statement.
As per Section 62(9), the ROs may reject the nomination papers for defects in a candidate’s qualifications to be a member of the national or provincial assembly; defects in qualifications of proposer or seconder to subscribe to nomination papers; material deficiencies or falsehood in declarations and documents required to be submitted with the nomination papers; or ungenuine signatures of the proposer or seconder.
However, the ROs cannot reject nomination papers for defects that are not of a substantial nature, and may allow any such defects to be remedied forthwith, including an error in regard to the name, serial number in the electoral roll or other particulars of the candidate or their proposers or seconders so as to bring them in conformity with the corresponding entries in the electoral roll.
The ECP needs to look into whether these provisions have strictly been complied with. In case of non-compliance, the ECP may use its powers under Section 55 to proceed against the officials concerned. Moreover, the ECP may review an order passed by an officer under the Act or the Rules, as provided in Section 8(e) of the Elections Act.

1,SC to settle disqualification question today,"Seven-judge bench will decide whether duration of ineligibility is five years, or life.","ISLAMABAD: A seven-judge Supreme Court is set to determine, once and for all, whether electoral disqualification for life under Article 62(1)(f) of the constitution as commanded by the court earlier will prevail or the Elections Act 2017 that later reduced the ineligibility to five years.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, the larger bench also consisting of Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Yahya Afridi, Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel, Justice Muham­mad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali will commence the hearing on Tuesday (today).
Earlier on Dec 11, the court had referred an electoral disqualification dispute to the three-judge committee formed under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023 to constitute a larger bench for deciding the matter for all times to come.
The matter was referred for final adjudication in view of a legal dilemma that may arise in view of the SC’s April 13, 2018, judgement in the Samiullah Balcoh case when it shut the doors of parliament permanently for politicians disqualified under Article 62(1)(f) through a unanimous verdict that such ineligibility was for life.

Seven-judge bench will decide whether duration of ineligibility is five years, or life

But on June 26, 2023, an amendment was inserted in the Elections Act 2017 through Section 232(2) specifying that the period of electoral disqualification will be for five years, and not for life.
Since the amendment to the Election Act has not been challenged, this matter may create confusion in the upcoming elections whether to rely on the SC judgement or the Elections Act.
Such a situation is not conducive for democracy, the CJP had obser­ved then during the hearing.
The controversy surfaced when a three-judge bench — comprising the CJP, Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan and Justice Athar Minallah — was hearing an election dispute instituted by Sardar Confcius Imam Qaisarani against Sardar Mir Bashah Khan Qaisarani.
The appeals pertain to the disqualification of candidates who wanted to contest elections. One appeal was about a provincial assembly seat while the other related to a National Assembly seat. Though the parties were different, the issue was the same.
The general elections that were held in 2008 required candidates to have a minimum graduation qualification. Some candidates made mis-declarations in their nomination papers, some produced degrees from unrecognised institutions and yet others submitted fake degrees to show eligibility for participation in the elections.
According to the last order, the apex court had disqualified all such candidates with some even facing criminal prosecution. Since a criminal appeal was pending adjudication before a high court, the court decided to intervene only in the matter concerning the question of disqualification. The issue of disqualification cropped up when the court noted that Sardar Mir Badshah Khan Qaisarani, who had filed nomination papers from NA-189 and PP-240 Taunsa (Dera Ghazi Khan) constituencies during the 2008 and 2018 elections, respectively, was disqualified for producing a fake degree. His appeal is still pending before the Lahore High Court.
During the hearing, the SC bench had made it clear that the pendency of the present case should not be used as a tool or a pretext to delay the Feb 8, 2024 general elections, either by the Election Commission of Pakistan or any other entity.
The court then even went on to caution that those airing apprehensions regarding delay in the elections will be exposing them to the contempt of court charges also affirming that the polls will be conducted positively on Feb 8. The court had also sought assistance from Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, provincial advocate generals as well as ECP and ordered for the publication of a public notice through prominent newspapers of English and Urdu languages so that anybody or political parties become party to the case if they wish so.

2,"Islamabad, New Delhi share prisoner and nuclear site lists","The two countries also exchanged lists of pri­soners held in each other’s custody, as per the Cons­ular Access Agreement of 2008.","ISLAMABAD: India and Pakistan on Monday continued their decades-long practice of exchanging lists of nuclear installations and prisoners on the first day of the new year.
These exchanges reflect a rare instance of cooperation between the two nuclear-armed nations.
Under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Atta­cks against Nuclear Insta­llations and Facilities, signed on Dec 31, 1988, which took effect from Jan 27, 1991, both countries have committed to annually share information about their nuclear installations and facilities.
These lists were excha­nged for the first time on Jan 1, 1992.
According to a Foreign Office (FO) statement, the list of nuclear installations and facilities in Pakistan was officially handed over to a representative of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad at the Minis­try of Foreign Affairs.
Simultaneously, the Indian Ministry of Exter­nal Affairs provided their list to the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi.
In addition to the nuc­l­e­ar lists, the two countries also exchanged lists of pri­soners held in each other’s custody, as per the Cons­ular Access Agreement of 2008.
This agreement requ­ires the sharing of prisoners’ lists twice a year, on January 1 and July 1. The government of Pakistan submitted a list of 231 Indian prisoners (47 civilian prisoners and 184 fishermen) to the Indian High Commission in Islamabad. Conversely, the Indian government shared a list of 418 Pakistani prisoners (337 civilian prisoners and 81 fishermen) in Indian jails with the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi.
Pakistan on this occasion called on India to release and repatriate Pakistani civilian prisoners and fishermen, who have completed their sentences and whose nationalities have been confirmed.
Further, Pakistan requested consular access to missing defence personnel from the 1965 and 1971 wars, and special consular access to 77 civil prisoners.
These exchanges highlight the ongoing complex relationship between the two neighbouring countries, marked by conflicts since their independence in 1947.
Despite tensions, these exchanges demonstrate a commitment to upholding long-standing agreements and maintaining a measure of diplomatic engagement.

3,"Mass rejection of PTI leaders’ papers to harm democracy, says PML-N senator",Senate unanimously adopts PPP resolution seeking punishment for anti-armed forces propaganda.,"ISLAMABAD: As Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) lawmakers in the Senate appeared to be making out a case for the last-minute postponement of the general elections, a PML-N senator on Monday flabbergasted many by saying that mass rejection of nomination papers of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) candidates was detrimental to democracy.
“If you weaken the political parties, you weaken the federation,” Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed of PML-N warned while speaking in the Senate.
Stressing that old mistakes must not be repeated, he said elections should not be of the kind held in 2018. He said the 2018 elections were manipulated and engineered by intelligence and security agencies. He also referred to the result transmission system (RTS) fiasco and said “if we have to move forward, the process should not be repeated”.
Mr Syed also said that the practice of enforced disappearances was not acceptable because human rights and democracy were part of Pakistanis’ DNA. He stressed that rule of law must prevail in the country.
He was of the view that if somebody has committed a crime, he should be charged, brought before a court of law and tried there. He said the people against whom evidence is available should be punished and others against whom there is no evidence, should be freed.

Senate unanimously adopts PPP resolution seeking punishment for anti-armed forces propaganda

Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haidri of JUI-F in his speech termed peace an essential prerequisite for elections and referred to the worsening law and order situation with particular reference to the recent armed attack on Maulana Fazalur Rahman’s convoy in D.I. Khan.
He said that northern parts of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) will remain in the grip of severe cold in January and February. He, however, said his party will take part in the elections if institutions, including the court, remained firm in getting polls held on Feb 8.
Senator Maulana Faiz Muhammad of the same party said if elections were to be held, provision of security was the responsibility of the government.
Another party Senator Attaur Rahman said it was not possible for his party leaders to travel in D.I. Khan and Tank.
“Should we understand that an attempt is being made again to hijack elections?” he asked.
Senator Tahir Bizenjo of National Party said enforced disappearances in Balochistan were a reality and, instead of crafting a counter narrative against voices of concern, a permanent solution should be found out.
Haji Hidayatullah of ANP said as many as 1,200 leaders and workers of his party had become victims of terrorist attacks since 2008 and the same game was played against it in 2018. He said his party leader Aimal Wali Khan was receiving threats ahead of 2024 polls again.
Senator Humayun Mohmand of PTI said that transparent and fair elections were badly needed to ensure stability in the country. He, however, regretted that not only PTI candidates, but their proposers and seconders were also being picked up.
PPP’s pro-armed forces resolution passed
Meanwhile, the Senate on Monday unanimously passed a resolution seeking severe punishment for those making malicious and negative propaganda against the armed forces.
The resolution, moved by PPP Senator Bahramanad Khan Tangi as placed on the agenda, called for a 10-year disqualification from public office for those “found involved in negative and malicious propaganda against the armed forces and other security agencies of Pakistan”.
However, during the session on Monday, Mr Tangi informed the House that he has amended the resolution to remove the demand for a decade-long disqualification and sought action in accordance with the law.
The resolution expressed deep concern over the “negative and malicious propaganda against the armed forces and other security agencies on various social media platforms”.
It highlighted the “huge sacrifices of armed forces and other security agencies in the war against terror and for the defence and protection of the country’s borders” and acknowledged that a “strong army and other security agencies are indispensable for the defence of the country especially in view of the hostile neighbourhood”.
“The Senate of Pakistan, therefore, recommends that the government takes necessary steps to award severe punishment as per law for all those found involved in negative and malicious propaganda against the armed forces and other security agencies of Pakistan,” the resolution said.

4,PTI leaders move election tribunals against rejection of their candidatures,"LHC orders ROs to issue attested copies of their decisions to Elahi, family.","PESHAWAR / LAHORE / KARACHI: PTI leaders approached election tribunals on Monday against the decisions of the returning officers regarding the rejection of their nomination papers for the February 8 elections.
In Sindh, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Haleem Adil Sheikh, and Firdous Shamim Naqvi were among around 20 appellants who approached the tribunals established at Sindh High Court’s principal seat in Karachi.
The election tribunals issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan, returning officers concerned, and other respondents with directions to file comments by Jan 4.
Barrister Ali Tahir filed the appeals on behalf of the PTI vice chairman and his son and submitted that the rejection from NA-214 (Tharparkar) was based on the absence of a no dues certificate of agricultural income tax and no dues certificate from the ‘mukhtiarkar’ (revenue administrative offi­cer) concerned. The appellant argued that such reasons were politically motivated and not sustainable.

LHC orders ROs to issue attested copies of their decisions to Elahi, family

They also contended that under Section 60(2) of the Elections Act 2017, the candidates were not legally required to provide such certificates. The lawyer asserted that the RO had not relied upon any objection or the report of any institution while rejecting the nomination papers.
He also submitted that the PTI leader was unaware of liable dues with regards to the telephone bill which was used during his tenure as an MNA. About the verification of the authority letter, the lawyer argued that the PTI vice chairman was incarcerated in jail and the administration had not let the appellant sign any authority letter.
Thereafter, he submitted that an application in this regard was filed on Dec 20 and the judge directed the jail authorities to do the needful.
The lawyer said the authority letter was signed by the appellant in the name of an authorised representative and such application and order were shown to RO, but he acted in complete defiance of law.



 
Another PTI incarcerated leader Haleem Adil Shaikh also filed an election appeal through his attorney since the RO had rejected his nomination papers from NA-238 (Karachi East-IV). The appellant said his candidature was rejected on politically motivated grounds.
Former PTI lawmaker Firdous Shamim Naqvi, who is currently confined at his house in connection with a case related to the May 9 incidents, through his lawyer filed an election appeal against the order of RO. The nomination papers of the PTI leader were rejected from NA-236 (Karachi East-II) and impugned the same before the election tribunal.
Representing the appellant, Jibran Nasir advocate was of the view that Mr Naqvi had filed three identical nomination papers from the same constituency as a precautionary measure after incidents of harassment and abduction of seconders and proposers were reported, especially from Punjab.
However, he maintained that all such papers were rejected by the RO on the ground that the appellant’s party had lost the electoral symbol without perusing the order of the Peshawar High Court (PHC), which had suspended the decision of the Election Commission of Pakistan against the election symbol of PTI.
Khurram Sherzaman also approached the election tribunal against rejection of his nomination from NA-241(Karachi South-III). Appeals were also filed by former PTI MNAs Attaullah and Aftab Jahangir since their nomination papers were also rejected from NA-245 (Karachi West-I) and NA-244 (Karachi West-II).
PTI’s Dr Masroor Sial (NA-230 Malir-II) and Saeed Afridi (NA-245 & 246) were also among the appellants who approached the tribunal on Monday. The tribunals issued notices to respondents directing them to file comments by Jan 4.
Punjab
PTI ticket aspirant Barrister Shahid Masood filed an appeal before the appellate tribunal challenging the rejection of his nomination papers from NA-131, Kasur. The appellant alleged that the RO rejected his papers only for his affiliation with the PTI.
Mansoor Sabir Ansari of PTI and Zaigham Abbas of PML-Q also filed appeals against the rejection of their nomination papers from PP-176 in Kasur and PP-131 in Gujrat, respectively.
Separately, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi of the LHC directed the ROs of different national and provincial constituencies in Gujrat and Mandi Bahauddin to issue attested copies of their decisions regarding the rejection of nomination papers of PTI President Parvez Elahi, his wife Qaisera Elahi, son Moonis Elahi and others.



 
Mr Elahi and others filed petitions pleading that the ROs dismissed their nomination papers but had not issued attested copies of the impugned decisions allegedly to delay the filing of the appeals before the appellant tribunals. Justice Najafi ordered the ROs of NA-64, NA-69, PP-32, PP-34, and PP-42 to provide the petitioners with attested copies of the decisions.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, several PTI members challenged the rejection of their nomination papers at the election tribunals of the PHC and its Abbottabad circuit bench. Nine PTI leaders challenged the returning officers’ decision to turn down their nomination papers in the high court while three others filed writ petitions at the PHC Abbottabad circuit bench.
Muhammad Atif Khan, PTI Peshawar region president, filed a writ petition at the PHC against the rejection of his nomination papers from NA-22 (Mardan) and PK-69. Similarly, Ali Muhammad Khan also challenged the rejection of his nomination papers at the PHC. Besides, Mujahid Khan from Mardan district also challenged the rejection of his nomination papers.
PTI candidates Zahir Shah for PK-58 and Abdul Salam Afridi for PK-58 also approached the PHC against the rejection of their nomination papers. Besides, Iftikhar Mashwani and Amir Farzand Khan also filed writ petitions in the PHC against the rejection of their nomination papers for the PK-60 and PK-61 constituencies.
Similarly, Aftab Alam, PTI candidate for the NA-35 (Kohat) approached the PHC election tribunal while Yousaf Khan approached the court against the rejection of his nomination papers from NA-31 (Hangu).
Abu Turab also petitioned the election tribunal against his disqualification. PHC judge Justice Syed Shakeel Ahmed will hear the petitions at the election tribunal.
In Manshera, the PTI challenged the disqualification of Senator Azam Khan Swati and others at the PHC Abbottabad circuit bench.
“We have separately moved our writ petitions challenging the returning officers’ orders in which they disqualified me, Senator Azam Khan Swati and others from contesting Feb 8 general elections,” Kamal Saleem Swati, PTI’s divisional spokesperson told reporters. The PHC CJ gave the Abbottabad circuit bench the authority to act as the regional election tribunal under Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel to hear election-related issues in the Hazara division.
A PTI lawyers panel led by Munir Hussain Lughmani advocate and including Barrister Mudassar Usman and Waqar Khan advocate moved separate petitions for Mr Swati whose nomination papers were rejected by the RO in NA-15 (Mansehra-II), Kamal Saleem Swati whose nomination papers were rejected in NA-14 (Mansehra-I) and PK-37, and Sardar Khan whose nomination papers were rejected by in PK-38. Separately, Nooruddin Khilji, Sardar Khadim Hussain Wardak, Abdul Ghafar Kakar and Adil Bazi of the PTI challenged the rejection of their nomination papers in Balochistan.
Nisar Ahmed Khan in Mansehra and Saleem Shahid in Quetta also contributed to this report

5,PM Kakar ‘loses his cool’ over Baloch protests in capital,"Claims those protesting are relatives of ""people fighting against the state"".","LAHORE: Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Monday took exception to the support lent to Baloch protesters, who have been staging a sit-in in Islamabad for more than a week for the recovery of their loved ones and extra-judicial killings in the province.
The caretaker premier, who spent more than 15 minutes of a 20-minute press conference on the issues of Balochistan at Lahore’s Central Business District, appeared visibly irked.
Speaking about those who are supporting the Baloch protest, Mr Kakar said they could go join the Baloch militants.
 






“Advocates of terrorists in Balochistan should go and join them if they are convinced on the veracity of their issue and fight the state along with them, so that we know where they stand and how to deal with them,” he said, alluding to rights activists and journalists standing with the Baloch marchers.

Challenges those championing rights of Baloch to ‘go and join the militants’; claims those protesting are relatives of ‘people fighting against the state’

Responding to the media on the issue of police violence against Baloch protesters in Islamabad, the caretaker premier said that some of the people — media persons included — were trying to “mislead everyone, turning themselves into fake heroes of human rights and damaging the state”.
The caretaker PM insisted that those protesting in Islamabad are the “relatives of those fighting against the state” in Balochistan. He, however, added that the state had a beef with militant outfits, not the Baloch people.
“We still respect their right to protest because their dear and near ones disappeared. But they should also know that they [militants] were fighting against the state, with the help of RAW funding and aided by India. It is an armed rebellion, with foreign help,” he said.
Mr Kakar said those trying to create human rights issues out of the use of water cannons against protestors should also explain who is killing common people in Balochistan.
“Who is engaged in armed mutiny against the state of Pakistan? I am sure if these so-called advocates go to Balochistan, they would be killed as well. But please, go and join the BLF or BLA so that the state knows where you stand. The state is clear on how to deal with this menace. Please clarify your position,” he demanded.
“Should we ignore the fact that over 90,000 innocent people have been killed and not even nine criminals have been convicted so far? Our criminal justice is weak, and cannot punish terrorists. Should we let them go on a rampage? Have these false advocates [of human rights] tried to unmask those who are behind this carnage? Who is doing it? Isn’t investigative journalism part of their duty? If they are turning the handling of protestors into a human rights issue, taunting me about my Balochis­tan origin, and raising an uproar about how can it happen right under my nose, they must also bring out the other side of the picture,” he added.
“There are organised attacks taking place on security forces on a daily basis. Why not demand the arrest of killers of security forces and innocent people? Drawing a one-sided picture and then trying to take social, professional and political mileage out of it will not be allowed because it damages the state,” the caretaker PM added.
“I insist and support their right to protest for their dear ones. My problem is with those trying to project the wrong interpretation of the issue and exploiting it for their ends,” he added.
According to Mr Kakar, protest within the ambit of law was everyone’s right, the state has to respond if a limit is crossed. “After all, what happened on May 9? The PTI people were also protesting. Why are they taken to task? They crossed the legal limit. Everyone can protest but only with legal limits,” he added.
Known for his soft-spoken demeanour, Mr Kakar did not hold back on the first day of the new year and, at certain points, his tone was bordering on hostile. During the talk, he also told a journalist to stay quiet as they tried to interject with a question while he was speaking.
