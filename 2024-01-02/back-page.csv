0,Massive Japan quake triggers tsunami waves,"Destroys buildings, knocks out power to thousands of homes and disrupts travels; no irregularities confirmed at nuclear power","

Wajima (Japan): People stand next to large cracks in the pavement after evacuating into a street in this city in the Ishikawa prefecture on New Year’s Day. A major 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Noto region in the afternoon, sending tsunami waves over a metre high crashing into the coastline of central Japan, prompting authorities to urge people to evacuate to higher grounds.—AFP

 
TOKYO: A powerful earthquake struck central Japan on Monday, triggering warnings for residents to evacuate some areas on its west coast, destroying buildings, knocking out power to thousands of homes and disrupting travel to the region.
The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.6 triggered waves of around one metre along parts of the Sea of Japan coast, with authorities saying larger waves could follow.
The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued tsunami warnings for the coastal prefectures of Ishikawa, Niigata and Toyama. A major tsunami warning — the first since the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that struck northeastern Japan — was initially issued for Ishikawa but later downgraded.
Russia also issued tsunami warnings in its far eastern cities of Vladivostok and Nakhodka.

Destroys buildings, knocks out power to thousands of homes and disrupts travels; no irregularities confirmed at nuclear power plants

Several houses have been destroyed and army units have been dispatched to help with rescue operations, top government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, adding that authorities were still assessing the extent of the damage.
More strong quakes in the area, where seismic activity has been simmering for more than three years, could occur over coming days, JMA official Toshihiro Shimoyama said.
In comments to the press shortly after the quake struck, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also warned residents to prepare for more disasters.
“Residents need to stay on alert for further possible quakes and I urge people in areas where tsunamis are expected to evacuate as soon as possible,” Kishida said.
“Run!” a bright yellow warning flashed across television screens advising residents in specific areas of the coast to immediately evacuate their homes.
Images carried by local media showed a building collapsing in a plume of dust in the coastal city of Suzu and a huge crack in a road in Wajima where panicked-looking parents clutched their children. There have been reports of at least 30 collapsed buildings in Wajima, NHK reported, citing the city’s fire department.
The quake also jolted buildings in the capital Tokyo, some 500 km from Wajima on the opposite coast.
More than 36,000 households had lost power in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures, utilities provider Hokuriku Electric Power said.
High speed rail services to Ishikawa have been suspended while telecom operators Softbank and KDDI reported phone and internet service disruptions in Ishikawa and Niigata, according to their websites.
Japanese airline ANA turned back planes headed to airports in Toyama and Ishikawa, while Japan Airlines cancelled most of its services to Niigata and Ishikawa regions and authorities said one of Ishikawa’s airports was closed.
Nuclear plants
Japans Nuclear Regulation Authority said no irregularities have been confirmed at nuclear power plants along the Sea of Japan, including five active reactors at Kansai Electric Powers Ohi and Takahama plants in Fukui Prefecture.
Hokuriku’s Shika plant in Ishikawa, the closest nuclear power station to the quake’s epicentre, had already halted its two reactors before the quake for regular inspections and saw no impact from the quake, the agency said.
The 2011 earthquake and tsunami killed nearly 20,000 people and devastated towns and triggered nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima.
Another quake, known as the Great Hanshin Earthquake, hit western Japan in 1995, killing more than 6,000 people, mainly in the city of Kobe.
Monday’s quake struck during the Jan. 1 public holiday when millions of Japanese traditionally visit temples to mark the new year.
In Kanazawa, a popular tourist destination in Ishikawa, images showed the remnants of a collapsed gate strewn at the entrance of a shrine as anxious worshippers looked on.
Kanazawa resident Ayako Daikai said she had evacuated to a nearby elementary school with her husband and two children soon after the earthquake hit. Classrooms, stairwells, hallways and the gymnasium were all packed with evacuees, she said.
“I also experienced the Great Hanshin Earthquake, so I thought it would be safest to evacuate,” she told Reuters when contacted by telephone.
“We haven’t decided when to return home yet.” The jolt was also felt by tourists who had flocked to Japan’s mountainous Nagano region for the start of the snow sports season.
Johnny Wu, a 50-year-old Taiwanese snowboarder, was waiting for a shuttle bus back to his hotel in the resort town of Hakuba when the quake hit, rattling windows and shaking snow of roofs and overhead electric wires.
“Everybody was panicked at that time. I’m a little bit better because, I come from Taiwan, so I’ve experienced a lot. But still, (I’m) still worried about (the quake) getting more serious,” he said.

1,"Gaza war to continue through 2024, warns Tel Aviv","Death toll rises to 22,000 as Israeli tanks withdraw from certain areas amid shift to ""lower-intensity operations"".","

Istanbul: Tens of thousands of people demonstrate to show solidarity with the Palestinian people amid the Gaza crisis, at the Galata Bridge, on Monday. They gathered around the bridge to denounce the ‘terrorism of the PKK and Israel’ and to support the Palestinians in Gaza, the official Turkish agency Anadolu said.—AFP

 
• Death toll rises to 22,000 as Israeli tanks withdraw from certain areas amid shift to ‘lower-intensity operations’
• Ceasefire talks underway in Cairo
GAZA STRIP: Israel warned on Wednesday that its war in Gaza would continue throughout 2024 as unrelenting strikes killed at least 25 people in the beseiged enclave on New Year’s Day.
Israel’s military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a New Year’s message that some of the 300,000 army reservists would get a break in order to prepare for the “prolonged fighting” ahead.
“The army must plan ahead, understanding that we will be required for additional tasks and warfare throughout this year,” Hagari said.
“We are also currently adapting the planning of the force deployment in Gaza and the reserve system. Some of the reservists will return to their families and employment this week.
“This will significantly ease the burden on the economy and allow them to gather strength for the upcoming activities in the next year, as the fighting will continue and they will still be required,” Hagari added.
Heavy artillery fire again pounded targets in Gaza, killing 25 people on Monday, health ministry officials there said, with attacks reported across the length of the territory.
The Gaza health ministry said 15 dead bodies from the same family were recovered Monday from the rubble of a bombed house in Jabalia, in the northern part of the territory.
The Israeli offensive has reduced vast areas of Gaza to a ruined wasteland and killed 21,822 people, mostly women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry.
Tel Aviv pulled tanks out of some Gaza City districts on Monday, residents said, as it announced plans to shift tactics and cut back on troop numbers, but fighting raged elsewhere in the Palestinian enclave along with intense bombardment.
“This appears to be the start of the gradual shift to lower-intensity operations in the north that we have been encouraging,” the official said.
Residents of Sheikh Radwan district in Gaza City, in the northern part of the enclave that Israel’s offensive focused on first, said tanks had withdrawn after what they described as the most intense 10 days of bombardment since the conflict began.
Israel’s decision to withdraw some troops from Gaza appears to signal the start of a shift to lower-intensity operations in the north of the Palestinian enclave, although there was still fighting going on there, a US official said
“The tanks were very near. We could see them outside the houses. We couldn’t get out to fill water,” said Nasser, who lives in Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhoods.
Tanks also pulled out of Gaza City’s Al Mina district and parts of Tel Al Hawa district, while retaining some positions in the suburb controlling the enclave’s main coastal road, residents said.
“We are exhausted... We were displaced five times during this war,” said 29-year-old Bassam Hana.
“We hope things improve in 2024 and that we live just like any other human being. Currently, we live like animals.”
At least 48 Palestinians were killed in strikes on Gaza City over the weekend, the territory’s health ministry said, with many still buried under the rubble.
Regional fears
International mediators have continued efforts toward a pause in fighting.
A Hamas delegation from Qatar visited Cairo on Friday to discuss an Egyptian three-phase plan proposing renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of Israeli prisoners for Palestinians, and ultimately an end to the hostilities, sources close to Hamas said.
Their allies Islamic Jihad said on Saturday that Palestinian factions were evaluating the proposal and would give a response “within days”.
The Israeli army claimed on Sunday night that it had intercepted two ‘hostile aircraft’ launched from Syria towards northern Israel.
It had spoken earlier of launches toward Israeli territory from Lebanon.

2,Bangladeshi Nobel winner convicted of violating labour laws,"“I have been punished for a crime that I haven’t committed,” says Muhammad Yun­us.","

Muhammed Yunus

 
DHAKA: Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yun­us was convicted on Mon­day of violating Bang­ladesh’s labour laws in a case decried by his supporters as politically motivated.
Yunus, 83, is credited with lifting millions out of poverty with his pioneering microfinance bank but has earned the enmity of longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has accused him of “sucking blood” from the poor.
Hasina has made several scathing verbal attacks against the internationally respected 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who was once seen as a political rival.
Yunus and three colleagues from Grameen Telecom, one of the firms he founded, were accused of violating labour laws when they failed to create a workers’ welfare fund in the company.
A labour court in the capital Dhaka convicted and sentenced them to “six months’ simple imprisonment”, lead prosecutor Khurshid Alam Khan said, adding that all four were immediately granted bail pending appeals.
All four deny the charges. Dozens of people staged a small rally in support of Yunus outside the court.
“I have been punished for a crime that I haven’t committed,” Yunus told reporters after the hearing. “If you want to call it justice, you can.”
Yunus is facing more than 100 other charges over labour law violations and alleged graft.
He told reporters after one of the hearings last month that he had not profited from any of the more than 50 social business firms he had set up in Bangladesh.
“They were not for my personal benefit,” Yunus said at the time.

3,Putin vows to ‘intensify’ attacks on Ukraine,Four killed by shelling in Moscow-held Done­tsk on New Year’s eve,"MOSCOW: President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Moscow would intensify strikes on military targets in Ukraine, after an unprecedented Ukrainian attack over the weekend on the Russian city of Belgorod.
The Ukrainian attack on Saturday, which killed 25 people including five children, came after Moscow launched a large-scale attack on Ukrainian cities.
“We’re going to intensify the strikes. No crime against civilians will rest unpunished, that’s for certain,” Putin said during a visit to a military hospital. He said Russia would continue to hit what he called “military installations”.
“We are doing that today and tomorrow we will continue doing it,” Putin announced, speaking almost two years into Moscow’s military offensive in Ukraine.

Four killed by shelling in Moscow-held Done­tsk on New Year’s eve

Ukrainian shelling of the Moscow-held city of Donetsk on New Year’s Eve killed four people and wounded 13, Russian-installed authorities said on Monday.
The shelling came at the end of a deadly week in Ukraine, with both sides hitting each other with large-scale attacks.
“As a result of Ukrainian shelling of central Donetsk on New Year’s Eve we can say that there are four dead and 13 wounded,” the Russian-installed head of Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, said in a video on Telegram, adding that Ukraine used cluster munitions.
Pushilin said the attack hit the Voroshilov district in central Donetsk.
He accused Ukraine of “having an aim to cause as much harm as possible to the civilian population because it used cluster munitions.” The US has supplied Kyiv with cluster munitions, in a move that was criticised even by its own allies.
Cluster munitions are a controversial weapon designed to disperse or release tiny explosives. They explode mid-air and scatter bomblets over a wide area, and also pose a lasting threat.
Meanwhile, Kyiv said Russia had targeted the country with a “record” number of drones on New Year’s Day.
“What happened in Belgorod is a terrorist act,” Putin told wounded Russian soldiers sitting near him in hospital pyjamas and sanitary masks. “There is no other way to call it.”
He accused Ukrainian forces of targeting “right in the city centre, where people were walking around, before New Year’s Eve” and alleged they had “purposefully hit the civilian population”.
Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said that the death toll had risen to 25, saying medics were unable to save a toddler who was seriously injured in the attack.
“Today in the local children’s hospital a four-year-old girl, who was in a serious condition with severe injuries to the chest and internal organs, died,” Gladkov said.
Her death brought the number of child victims of the attack to five. “This is an irreparable loss for all of us,” Gladkov said.
He said a total of 109 people were wounded, 45 of which are still in medical facilities.
Speaking about the situation on the battlefield, Putin said he believed the “strategic initiative” in the drawn-out conflict in Ukraine was on the Russian side. “In any case, that is how I am being briefed,” he said.
He also claimed Moscow wanted to end the conflict — which has dragged on for almost two years — “as quickly as possible” but “only on our terms”, according to Russia’s state-run TASS news agency.

4,SC to take up PTI’s petition against ECP tomorrow,"CJP Qazi Faez Isa will head the bench, while Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali will be its other members.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court will take up on Wednesday (tomorrow) the PTI’s petition seeking initiation of contempt charges against the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for alleged violation of its Dec 22 directives.
Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa will head the bench, while Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali will be its other members.
On Monday, PTI leader Shoaib Shaheen appeared before the bench to request early fixing of the case but was told to wait till the tea break.
Instead, the counsel went to the Islamabad High Court’s premises to file an appeal before the election tribunal against the rejection of his nomination papers two days ago.
Mr Shaheen returned after filing his election appeal, but instead of entering the courtroom, he got himself busy talking to the media inside the Supreme Court’s premises.
The court then fixed the PTI’s petition for hearing on Wednesday before a three-judge bench. It was moved on behalf of PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan through Advocate Shoaib Shaheen seeking a directive from the Supreme Court to the authorities for ensuring a level playing field by not arresting PTI candidates, workers and leaders.
The Supreme Court had directed the ECP on Dec 22 to hear grievances of the party on an urgent basis and resolve these expeditiously in order to ensure that the electoral process remains smooth, open, transparent, free and fair.
“Let this exercise be completed by ECP promptly,” the top court had ordered, without disturbing the timelines given in the election schedule because voters must have “faith in the electoral process for our democracy to succeed”, the order had stated.
The contempt of court petition named as respondents Interior Secretary Aftab Akbar Durrani, ECP Secretary Omar Hamid Khan, the chief secretaries and the police chiefs of the four provinces.
The petition pleaded that contempt proceedings be initiated against the respondents for non-compliance with the apex court’s Dec 22 orders.
The SC was requested to issue orders to the authorities concerned to ensure that ROs and DROs carry out their duties with impartiality, in accordance with the Constitution and do not discriminate against the PTI.

5,China willing to work with US for stable relationship: Xi,Exchanges greetings with President Biden on 45 years of diplomatic ties.,"

Xi Jinping

 
BEIJING: China’s President Xi Jinping on Monday said he was willing to work with the United States to promote stable bilateral ties, exchanging congratulations with his US counterpart Joe Biden on the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations, state media said.
Xi, in his message, said both countries have “weathered the storms and moved forward in general”, which has enhanced the well-being of their peoples and contributed to world peace, stability and prosperity, according to the ministry statement.
Xi called China and US forming ties “a major event” in the history of bilateral relations and in international relations.
China-US ties have been frosty but Biden administration officials have visited Beijing and met with their counterparts to rebuild communications and trust in the months leading up to a high-stakes summit between Xi and Biden in San Francisco in November, deemed an opportunity to cool tensions between the world’s two largest economies.

Exchanges greetings with President Biden on 45 years of diplomatic ties

Xi said the summit has pointed out the direction for both nations’ ties, under a future-oriented vision.
“I am willing to work with President Biden to continue to steer and navigate the China-US relationship for the benefit of China and the US and the two peoples, and to promote the cause of world peace and development,” Xi said.
The US is due its presidential election in November, in which former president and outspoken critic of China Donald Trump is campaigning against Biden to come back for a second term.
New Year’s wishes


Joe Biden

 
Xi also exchanged New Year’s messages with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un, and both announced 2024 to be a “friendship year” for both countries, launching a series of activities for that, the Chinese foreign ministry said separately.
Xi said China is willing to work with North Korea to deepen strategic mutual trust, enhance exchanges and cooperation, promote greater bilateral ties and make new contributions to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region.
On New Year’s Eve, the Chinese leader exchanged greetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin as well. This year is the 75th anniversary of China and Russia establishing diplomatic relations.
Russia’s economic reliance on China has grown as the country becomes increasingly isolated, hit by sanctions especially from Western countries since its invasion of Ukraine, a war which will enter its third year come February.
Xi said China and Russia should “continuously consolidate” and develop ties “featuring permanent good-neighbourly friendship”, along with comprehensive strategic coordination and mutually beneficial cooperation that would serve both countries’ interests.
This year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China by Mao Zedong, who defeated Republic of China forces led by Chiang Kai-shek in a bloody civil war.
