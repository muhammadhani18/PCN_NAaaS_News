The event was organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) at the Islamabad Club on Saturday, which brought together distinguished individuals, colleagues, friends and family, says a press release on Saturday.
PIDE Vice Chancellor Dr Nadeemul Haque, in his opening remarks, said Sartaj Aziz, a towering figure in Pakistani politics and a dedicated public servant, passed away recently, leaving behind a legacy of unwavering commitment to the betterment of his country.
The commemoration served as a platform for speakers to reflect on Mr Aziz’s profound impact on Pakistan and to acknowledge his enduring contributions, he said.
Dr Nadeem further noted that Mr Aziz, a distinguished statesman, served as the foreign minister of Pakistan with notable dedication and expertise.
Born in 1928, Aziz played a crucial role in shaping Pakistan’s foreign policy during his tenure. His extensive experience and diplomatic acumen positioned him as a key figure in international relations. As an economist by training, Aziz brought a unique blend of skills to his role, fostering diplomatic ties and representing Pakistan on the global stage.
Throughout his career, Mr Aziz addressed regional and global issues, and his contributions to diplomacy have left a lasting impact as his legacy continues to be recognised in the realm of international affairs.
The participants underscored Sartaj Aziz’s tireless efforts toward the economic development of Pakistan and emphasised that Aziz was not just a statesman; he was a visionary leader who dedicated his life to uplifting the socio-economic landscape of the nation, and his contributions will continue to inspire generations to come.
The speakers highlighted that Aziz held various important positions, as he served as the national security adviser to the prime minister and held key positions in economic and financial planning, contributing to the overall development of the country.
Besides, Sartaj Aziz played a crucial role in shaping the country’s security policies, showcasing his commitment to ensuring the well-being and stability of Pakistan.
His multifaceted career reflects a deep commitment to public service and a comprehensive understanding of the complex challenges facing Pakistan on both domestic and international fronts.
Mr Aziz was a dynamic speaker and a prolific writer. His books and monographs included ‘Industrial Location Policy of Pakistan (1969); ‘Hunger, Politics, and Markets: the Real Issues in the Food Crisis (1976); ‘Rural Development: Learning from China’ (1978); ‘Agricultural Policies for the 1990s, published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 1990; and ‘Hunger, Poverty, and Development: The Life and Work of Sartaj Aziz’, edited by Anwar Adil (2009). In 2009, Sartaj Aziz’s autobiography, ‘Between Dreams and Realities: Some Milestones in Pakistan’s History’, was published by Oxford University Press, whose updated version was published in 2019.
Moreover, prominent figures from various sectors, including government officials, academics, and members of the diplomatic community, were present at the event.
The memorial provided a platform for sharing anecdotes and memories that showcased Mr Aziz’s warmth and the impact he had on those around him.
The former foreign minister’s family members expressed gratitude to PIDE and Dr Nadeem for organising an event to pay tribute to the legendary Sartaj Aziz for his contributions to Pakistan.
Dr Nadeem expressed heartfelt condolences to the family of Mr Aziz and emphasised the importance of continuing the work he started.
“Mr Aziz’s legacy will live on through the institutions and policies he helped shape. It is now our responsibility to carry forward his vision for a prosperous and thriving Pakistan,” said PIDE vice chancellor.

3,Two ex-PMs of AJK urge civil society to review strike call for Feb 5,Say joint action committee should avoid any activity that may distract attention from our basic cause of Kashmir,"MUZAFFARABAD: Two former prime ministers of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Saturday called upon a joint action committee of the civil society activists to review their strike call for February 5 which is observed as “Kashmir Solidarity Day” across the country.
In their separate statements, Sardar Tanveer Ilyas, the regional president of Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP), and Raja Farooq Haider, central vice president of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N), said the action committee should avoid causing any divide on this national event when people from all shades of life zealously express their unwavering support and solidarity with the struggling Kashmiris and instead choose some other day for its strike call.
On Sunday last, a meeting of the Jammu Kashmir Joint Action Committee, which represents the civil society with business community people in the forefront, was held in Kotli where “different aspects of the ongoing movement for the rights of people as well as negotiation process with an official ‘reconciliatory committee,’ comprising cabinet members,” were reviewed.
It was there the committee had declared that a complete shutter-down and wheel jam strike would be held across the state on February 5 against the “non-implementation of the agreement of December 19, 2023 by the official reconciliatory committee within the stipulated period, continuation of unjustified load-shedding during the negotiation process, non-determination of the production cost of electricity from Mangla Dam, non-issuance of the notifications of the agreed-upon points of the charter of demand and other delaying tactics of the government.”

Say joint action committee should avoid any activity that may distract attention from our basic cause of Kashmir

“… Each year on February 5, we give a joint message that we are all one on the issue of Kashmir and while standing shoulder to shoulder with each other and forming human chains we reiterate our resolve to stand firm like a lead wall with our struggling brethren under illegal Indian occupation,” said Mr Ilyas in his statement.
“As prime minister, I initiated special efforts to involve other countries in expression of solidarity on this day and it makes me feel great that to see that justice loving nations and people have begun to acknowledge the legitimacy and rightfulness of the heroic struggle by the oppressed Kashmiris. It’s why I stress upon the joint action committee to avoid any activity that may distract attention from our basic cause,” he said.
Mr Ilyas, who was removed from the prime minister’s office by the AJK high court on an alleged commission of contempt, pointed out that usually shutter-down and wheel jam strikes in the state were held to condemn India’s unparalleled crimes against humanity in occupied Jammu and Kashmir and it would be “extremely inappropriate to relate this day with the crises created by the incompetent and amateurish Anwarul Haq led [AJK] government.”
“It’s the right of every citizen to hold peaceful protests for his rights and there is no harm in carrying on the ongoing peaceful rights movement. But on February 5, the whole nation should be united on a single point agenda to draw international attention towards India’s perpetual denial of the internationally acknowledged right to self-determination of the Kashmiri nation,” he said.
“Such kind of activity, however pure and pro-people may be the intentions of the organisers, will be exploited by India and other enemies of Pakistan and Kashmiris to the core and therefore it must be avoided on February 5,” he added.
Echoing his views, Mr Haider said February 5 was not a governmental even but a public activity during which Pakistanis and unfettered Kashmiris across the globe rose above their political, religious, ethnic and cultural affiliations to send a message of unflinching support and solidarity with their valiant brethren in the occupied territory waging a heroic struggle for freedom in face of the worst ever repression by despotic Indian regimes.
Mr Haider said peaceful protest was every citizen’s right but “solidarity with the occupied Kashmiris should not be sabotaged under its cover.”
“We may have grievances against the governments of Pakistan, but we salute the people of Pakistan who have always put Kashmir first and did not allow any government to strike a deal on it,” he said.
The PML-N leader pointed out that Pakistan was the only nation that had not given up the support for the Kashmiris even in the most adverse situations and that’s why the Kashmiris on both sides of the divide considered it as a holy land.
Mr Haider was of the view that the role of the AJK based political parties had become almost negligible over the past few years which was subsequently denting the national interests.
“Whether one speaks or not, I consider it my responsibility, regardless of its repercussions to my political interests, to warn all stakeholders to think sensibly at this crucial juncture. India has turned occupied Kashmir into a large prison and is carrying out its nefarious agenda there in an organised manner. In such a situation, any intentional and unintentional attempt to sabotage expression of solidarity on this national day will be tantamount to strengthening India’s devilish designs.”

7,Police ‘mistakenly’ raid house of PTI chairman in Islamabad,"Gohar claims son, nephew roughed up; police say house raided due to ""confusion"" about house address","ISLAMABAD: The capital police on Saturday raided the house of PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and later claimed it to be a result of ‘confusion’ over the residence’s address.
The police also raided the house of PTI’s Secretary General Omar Ayub Khan, as per a statement shared by the PTI leader on his social media account. The police, however, denied the raid.
Initially, the police denied that any raid was conducted at the residence of Gohar Ali Khan, but later a video went viral on social media after which the police issued ‘contradictory statements’ about the raid. Over the raid, the Supreme Court also took notice and summoned the chief of the capital police.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The raid at the PTI chairman’s house, located in F-7, was conducted when Barrister Khan was in the Supreme Court for the hearing on the petition against the restoration of the party’s electoral symbol. After getting information, he informed the apex court about the raid and left for his house.

Gohar claims son, nephew roughed up; police say house raided due to ‘confusion’ about house address

Later, he returned to the court and informed the bench that his son and nephew were tortured by the police. Besides, the police took a computer and documents from his house.
Police officers on condition of anonymity told Dawn that the raid was conducted on the directives of the senior officers. A police team reached the house of the PTI’s chairman in four vehicles for the raid, they stated. The team entered the house and left after confiscating a computer and some documents, they added.
Earlier, the police claimed that the house was raided on a tip-off regarding the presence of proclaimed offenders in the residence. But the contingent returned after learning that the house belonged to the PTI chief. The police denied confiscating any item, contrary to the claims made by Gohar Ali Khan.
In a statement, the police said the PTI chairman’s house was raided due to confusion about the address.
A police spokesperson said that the residence was raided to arrest proclaimed offenders. Replying to a question over the contradictory statements issued by the police, the PRO replied that the police entered the house of Barrister Gohar Ali Khan due to some confusion about the house address. The spokesperson, however, could not share the information about the alleged presence of POs. He, however, added that a team had been constituted to probe the matter.
Police chief visits residence
Talking to the media outside the PTI chairman’s house, the police chief said that under the directives of the top court, he came over to the house of Barrister Gohar Ali Khan to meet him and hear his complaint.
“A police team is also examining the crime scene because of his complaint,” he said, adding that the SP City was supervising the team investigating the incident.
There was information about the presence of proclaimed offenders in a house on the same street, the IGP said, adding that it happened due to confusion over the house address. However, the IGP ignored the question about the identification of proclaimed offenders.
In a tweet, PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub Khan claimed that the “Islamabad police have raided my house in Islamabad without a warrant”.
On the other hand, the police tweeted that they did not go to Omar Ayub’s house. The spokesperson also denied that the police raided the house of the PTI leader.
In a statement, the PTI condemned the raid on the residence of PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan. Reacting to the “unlawful raid” on the house of the PTI chairman, the PTI spokesperson said that the unidentified masked men roughed up Barrister Gohar’s son, nephew, and watchman. He pointed out that the unknown attackers not only ransacked Barrister Gohar’s house but also confiscated valuables.
The spokesperson said that it was the responsibility of the top court to bring to justice the criminal facilitators involved in the “ongoing state operation and repression against PTI’s candidates and to expose the conspiracy” to exclude the country’s largest party from the election.

9,Rawalpindi’s 6th Road metro station likely to get functional tomorrow,Station was damaged following arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan.,"RAWALPINDI: Eight months on, the 6th Road Metro Bus Station that was damaged on May 9 by protesters following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan will become functional on Monday.
Punjab Caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi is scheduled to visit the garrison city tomorrow to inaugurate three projects: the Business Facilitation Centre, the upgradation of the Rawalpindi Municipal Library, and the repair work at the 6th Road Metro Bus Station.
The renovation of the metro station by the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) was supposed to be completed by December-end at the cost of Rs99 million, but the project faced slight delays.
The bus station was damaged by the protestors on May 9 after the arrest of former premier Imran Khan in a corruption case. The protestors had entered the station during the riots and set it on fire.
Accordingly, a committee was constituted by the commissioner to inspect the metro stations damaged on May 9. The inspection committee submitted its report on May 14, 2023.
Based on the inspection report, Punjab Masstransit Authority (PMA) approached the RDA with a request to proceed with the restoration of the 6th Road Metro Bus Station.
Caretaker CM’s visit
Sources said the renovation was likely to be completed by Sunday and on Monday, the station would be inaugurated by the caretaker chief minister. According to Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chatha, the caretaker chief minister would also inaugurate the business facilitation centre in the garrison city. “The aim of setting up the centre is to provide the regulatory procedures carried out by various departments under one roof. The formalities before starting any business will be fulfilled here, as part of this one-window operation,” he said. He expressed hope that this would not only save them from the hassle of visiting various departments but would also save their time in obtaining NOCs.
He said this would be the first business facilitation centre in Rawalpindi. “It will help generate economic activities in this area which will eventually help people in getting employment opportunities at the local level,” he claimed. He said that with the establishment of this centre, people who want to do business in other divisions, can also get NOC by applying at the centre.
Speaking about the third project, Mr Chatha said that the 145-year-old Rawalpindi Municipal Library was being upgraded for Rs9 million. An e-library is also being set up to help the students. “Books for ‘competitive’ exams are also being provided and the students preparing for the Public Service Commission exams would able to prepare their exams without any hurdle,” he said, adding that there would be computers available at the library.

10,Capital’s 49 polluting brick kilns turned into zigzag technology,"Four traditional kilns dismantled and remaining 10 also being shifted to environment-friendly technology, says official.","ISLAMABAD: As many as 49 of the total 63 conventional brick kilns located within the federal capital territory, which were mainly responsible for air pollution, have been converted into zigzag technology, said a senior climate change ministry official.
“This will help mitigate air pollution woes in the capital and surrounding areas.” He said four traditional brick kilns had been dismantled and the remaining 10 were presently being shifted to the environment-friendly zigzag technology.
Talking to Dawn, Mohammad Saleem, deputy director and spokesperson Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, said the traditional brick manufacturing sector significantly contributed to the country’s breath-choking air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
Such brick kilns relied on dirty energy sources for baking bricks, mainly coal, rubber and shoe soles as fuel, emitting lethal black carbon emissions into the atmosphere, he said.

Four traditional kilns dismantled and remaining 10 also being shifted to environment-friendly technology, says official

The conversion to the zigzag technology would help reduce levels of the suffocating carbon emissions by 60pc and save their owners’ energy expenses by 30pc, he added.
“It’s an important achievement by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination and Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) supported by the Islamabad administration and other stakeholders to achieve the milestone with well-coordinated efforts despite various bottlenecks to fight escalating problem of air pollution in the capital city and its rural areas,” he added. 
While most of the air-contaminating brick kilns were located in rural areas of the capital city, these adjoining areas would particularly benefit from the cleaner air after the conversion of the traditional kilns to the cleaner brick-making zigzag technology.
Explaining the traditional brick-making process, which was damaging for health and environment, he said such brick producing process consisted of handmade bricks, which were baked in Fixed Chimney Bull’s Trench Kilns (FCBTK). It was a widely used brick firing technology in South Asian countries, including Pakistan, and ranked as the most contaminating techniques for brick production, resulting in adverse social and environmental effects, including air pollution, climate change, cardio-respiratory diseases, land use impacts and deforestation.
The traditional kiln type and fuels burned made it difficult to accurately identify the make-up of air pollutants emitted by the sector. They likely included sulfur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide (CO2), forms of particulate matter (PM) including black carbon and additional compounds released by burning coal and other fuels, the official added.
He said the black carbon, a major component of soot from the brick kilns, was produced as a result of the incomplete combustion of fossil fuel and biomass. Besides, it was also notoriously known for planet-warming impact on climate for being 460 to 1500 times stronger than CO2.
The official explained that the black smoke emitted by the traditional brick kilns, transport and industrial sectors was highly polluting and toxic, which was extremely dangerous for the public health and environment as well as key cause of blinding and suffocating smog. The black smoke was among the main causes of asthma, respiratory diseases, eye infections and other various lungs-related diseases in humans.
Mr Saleem said, “Given the backdrop of adverse health and environmental impacts, efforts were taken by the ministry for introducing the zigzag technology to mitigate the issues of not only the emission black carbons that cause black smog but also overall air pollution in the federal capital and its adjoining rural areas.”

11,Stalled water project gets rolling with philanthropist’s help,"TAXILA: The dream of over 20,000 villagers of the remote Thatta Khalil village of Taxila to get clean and affordable...","

Workers prepare to install an electricity transformer to enable pumps to supply water to the inhabitants of the area. The scheme has remained non-functional for the last 10 years. — Dawn

 
TAXILA: The dream of over 20,000 villagers of the remote Thatta Khalil village of Taxila to get clean and affordable water is near fulfillment thanks to a local social figure and philanthropist.
A project worth Rs36.449 million was approved by the Punjab government in Jan 2013 and was to be completed in three years but only building and structure could be completed on an 18 marla land donated by a villager.
Almost 10 years passed since the initiation of the project and only 70 per cent of the work could be completed and the rest, including power supply and installation of transformers, is yet to be done. Those who can afford boring have arranged their own water supply while the rest of the population has no option but to fetch water from different sources.
“Although we have donated free land for the execution of the water supply scheme, the fate of the project still hangs in the balance,” said Ghulam Fareed, a local resident. 
Mohammad Zaheer, another resident of area, said they were disappointed with the bureaucratic attitude of government officials and performance of the elected representatives.
“Water is the basic necessity of life and its availability should be ensured at all cost, but successive governments kept this public welfare project on the back burner ignoring the problem of thousands of people of poor and backward areas,” said Asif Malik, a resident of the area.
Now social figure and philanthropist Malik Sohail Akhtar has taken the responsibility of getting the water project completed. 
When contacted, Mr Akhter said it was disappointing that women and girls of the area fetched water twice a day from far off locations even in today’s modern era. He said being son of the soil he had decided to work for resolution of public issues in the backward area through his personal resources. 
He said he had provided necessary infrastructure, electric equipment and other resources to supply clean drinking water to the inhabitants of the area.
It may be noted that a study was undertaken to categorise the suitability of groundwater in Taxila by soil fertility survey and testing institute at Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi. During the study, a total of 628 water samples were collected from nine union councils in Taxila, analysed and categorised according to the suitability criteria of water quality evaluation. 
Sixty-six per cent of the samples were fit, 21 per cent were marginally fit and 13 per cent were found unfit. In the majority of the union councils, water was fit for irrigation except Thatta Khalil where 20 per cent of water samples were unfit due to higher electrical conductivity (EC). Residual sodium carbonate (RSC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were also higher in water samples.

13,JI rules out electoral alliance,ISLAMABAD: Unlike previous elections Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) has decided to contest elections on its own symbol...,"ISLAMABAD: Unlike previous elections Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) has decided to contest elections on its own symbol --weighing scale -- without entering into any alliance and has fielded candidates  in all the three constituencies of the federal capital.
As the Muttahida Majlis-i- Amal (MMA) was revived ahead of the 2018 election, JI was part of the alliance that included almost all the religo-political parties belonging to Shia, Barelvi and the Deobandi schools of thought.
The JI has decided that it will not enter into electoral alliance with any party in the forthcoming election.
However, the new entrant into politics at that time was the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) which entered the polls independently.
For the upcoming elections Naib Emir Mian Mohammad Aslam will be contesting from NA-46.
The constituency NA-46 starts from the Islamabad limits at Tarnol and it includes Golra Sharif, and the urban sectors up to Islamabad Expressway including I-8 to I-11 and E-8 up to E-11 and F-8 to F-11, G-8 to G-11, etc.
Mian Aslam was elected MNA from the same constituency in 2002 from the platform of MMA, by defeating Barrister Babar Awan of Pakistan People’s Party, Ahmed Raza Kasuri of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and Syed Zafar Ali Shah of the PML-N.
Mian Aslam is striving to contest the elections backed by his influence among the local religious circles as well as developing a considerable goodwill among the non-Muslim voters residing in Islamabad.
The JI candidate for NA-47 is Kashif Chaudhry, who is a local business leader and was previously in Shabab-i-Milli of Jamaat-i-Islami, while the JI candidate from NA-48 is Malik Abdul Aziz.
He is participating in the election for the first time.
The TLP candidates for Islamabad are all relatively new entrant. Sajid Mehmood is contesting from NA-46, and in the last elections the TLP candidate obtained 3,641votes from this constituency that was NA-54.
The TLP candidate from NA-47 is Hafiz Khawar Ikhlas, and in the 2018 elections when the same area was in constituency NA-53 the TLP candidate Muhammad Afnan Baloch obtained 5,147 votes.
In the last constituency of Islamabad NA-48, the TLP candidate is Chaudhary Azhar Mahmood, whereas the party candidate was Rizwan Ahmed in 2018 elections when the constituency was NA-52 by getting 11,996 votes.
The TLP chief Hafiz Saad Rizvi has announced to contest elections from NA-50, his home district Attock.

ISLAMABAD: A solo exhibition opened in the capital which is showcasing paintings by an artist who has drawn inspiration from American singer Bob Dylan’s music.
The Line Green Visual Art Space inaugurated the exhibition,Don’t think twice, It’s all right, that exhibited the works by Islamabad-based artist Samiya Mahir Sheikh.
Sheikh has displayed her works in Turkey, the United Kingdom and throughout Pakistan.
Curator and Founder of Line Green Alina Akbar said: “Samiya’s magnetic figurative paintings convey a sense of mystery and an atypical resolve in her playful, personal universe. Her compositions are known for their witty, whimsical, and impulsive nature. Although the subjects of her compositions vary from abstract bodies to mutated animals to illusory backgrounds, Samiya’s point of view remains consistent, where certainty is a myth and realities are rewritten over and over again.”
“Samiya focuses on transforming ideas and pre-conceived notions by infusing a psychedelic dream-like quality aided by expressive mark-making like tremors on canvas. She combines bold colours and forms while using acrylics and mixed media,” she added.
The founder of Line Green further commented that in this exhibition, Samiya had portrayed the conflict between what’s experienced in life and what’s largely perceived, what comes schemed in life and what comes instinctively, and what’s branded in contrast with what’s unknown to us. Besides, her paintings have this sense of familiarity, yet they contain a certain kind of unease, Ms Akbar said.
The artist draws her inspiration mainly from Dylan’s music, reflections on societal behaviour in times past and today, and standards of human nature.
Samiya remarked that the event is basically a collaboration between Bob Dylan’s music and art, as the idea behind her art is to use some of Dylan’s signature lyrics and poetry and integrate them with the art pieces.
“You can see a lot of different line work that represents the 1960s, which shows the flexibility of thought and the social shift at that time against the backdrop of the political turmoil and the questions raised by the Vietnam War and all the other movements happening around the world,” she added.
Samiya further said, “It also mimics what is happening today, where if we discuss the role of gender, society, the government, and ideologies, we see people drifting away from what used to be the norm and discussing a different recourse altogether. So there is nostalgia while remaining relevant to today.”
Mentioning the immersive creative experience, Samiya added, “For the 15 pieces that I worked on, the whole process enveloped Bob Dylan as I was constantly listening to Bob Dylan and his interviews, along with things from his era. His poetry has always struck a chord with people, and I wanted to use that backdrop to work towards an art form that represents not only the type of work that he has done but also the world we live in today.”
Zohair Waheed remarked: “This was an amazing solo show by Samiya, as she is redefining the notions of art by pushing the limits of imagination and creativity. Her use of artificial intelligence (AI) to amalgamate art and technology was a treat for the senses. She is surely a pioneer in the art industry of Pakistan.”
Usama Khilji noted: “A beautiful pop of much-needed colour by Samiya. What stood out most for me was the AI montage of the artwork on display that fluidly mashed the diverse art pieces into a short film with music. Such innovative use of technology that amalgamates beautiful hand-minted canvases shows how technology can aid the visual experience of art.”
Natalya Kamal commented, “Absolutely loved the show! Samiya is a true artist, and her work is truly amazing, thought-provoking, and an experience. I can’t wait to see more of her talent and work!”
Aleem Arif stated: “It was my first time attending a Samiya show, and I was blown away by the concept and the colours. Vivid forms materialise in Samiya’s broad, messy brush strokes that make her art truly stand out. I look forward to seeing what she does next.”
