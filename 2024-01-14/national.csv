1,"Without holding intra-party polls, ANP gets ‘lantern’",ECP allows the party to fulfil legal requirement even after general elections.,"ISLAMABAD: Only a day after delisting 13 political parties over their failure to conduct the mandated intra-party elections, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in its decision announced on Saturday allowed the Awami National Party (ANP) to contest polls on its election symbol of “Lantern” despite its failure to fulfil the legal requirement.
While announcing its reserved verdict, the ECP imposed a fine of Rs20,000 on the ANP with the direction to hold intra-party polls till May 10, some three months even after the Feb 8 general elections.
The order made many wonder under which law the ECP could allow one party, and not the other, to participate in general elections on its election symbol without intra-party election. Why the concession was not available to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, they question.

ECP allows the party to fulfil legal requirement even after general elections

The ECP had earlier noted that ANP’s last intra-party polls were conducted in May 2019, and since the term of office-bearers was four years according to its constitution, the same had already expired over eight months back.
The verdict, which was reserved on Dec 21, on the intra-party polls of ANP was announced on the last date for allocation of symbols to the contesting candidates by the returning officers.
Sections 208, 209, and 210 of the Elections Act, 2017, have been invoked to delist over a dozen political parties for failure to meet the legal requirement to be eligible to get poll symbol. 
A five-member bench of the ECP, headed by chief election commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, had earlier turned down ANP’s plea for a six-month time for conduct of intra-party elections, leaving a hint that ANP might not be able to contest the upcoming general election with its poll symbol. 
The list of election symbols recently sent to the returning officers also did not include the symbol of “Lantern”.

2,"LHC reserves verdict on Elahi, Qureshi pleas","Full court dismisses challenge to Nawaz’s nomination; decision on Imran’s papers for Lahore, Mianwali seats expected today.","• Full court dismisses challenge to Nawaz’s nomination
• Decision on Imran’s papers for Lahore, Mianwali seats expected today
LAHORE: A full bench of the Lahore High Court on Saturday reserved decisions on the petitions of PTI leadership Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Parvez Elahi as well as former minister Fawad Chaudhry and others against the rejection of their nomination papers for the Feb 8 election.
Headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, the three-judge bench allowed an appeal of Qaisera Elahi, the wife of Mr Elahi, gave a ruling in favour of the acceptance of her nomination papers for the four national and provincial assembly seats of NA-64, NA-69, PP-32 and PP-32 of Gujrat.
The bench, which also comprised Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan and Justice Jawad Hassan, dismissed an appeal of ex-minister Moonis Elahi against the rejection of his nomination papers from the same constituencies besides PP-34.
The court reserved its verdict on Mr Elahi’s challenge to the rejection of his nomination papers from seven national and provincial constituencies including NA-59, NA-64, NA-69, PP-23, PP-42, PP-32 and PP-34.
Also, the court reserved its decision on the petition of Mr Qureshi against the rejection of his nomination papers from NA-150, NA-151 and PP-218 constituencies of Multan, though it dismissed appeals against the acceptance of nomination papers of his son Zain Qureshi and daughter Mehar Bano Qureshi from NA-150 and PP-218.
Imran papers for Mianwali, Lahore 
The LHC bench will take up on Sunday (today) the petitions of imprisoned PTI founding chairman Imran Khan challenging the rejection of his nomination papers from Mianwali and Lahore constituencies of the National Assembly (NA-89 and NA-122).
Also on Sunday, the court is expected to decide the petitions of Fawad Chaudhry, Hammad Azhar and PTI social media activist Sanam Javed against the dismissal of their appeals by the appellate tribunals.
Nawaz Sharif 
On the other hand, the LHC on Saturday dismissed a petition challenging the acceptance of former premier Nawaz Sharif’s nomination papers from NA-130 constituency of Lahore.
Pakistan Awami Mahaz chief Advocate Ishtiaq Ahmad Chaudhry had filed the petition after the dismissal of his appeal by an appellate tribunal.
The petitioner pleaded that Mr Sharif was not eligible to contest the election due to a lifetime disqualification held by the Supreme Court for a person disqualified under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution. He said Mr Sharif was disqualified for being not righteous and sagacious.
However, when the bench observed that the Supreme Court had recently annulled the lifetime disqualification, the lawyer argued that the decision of the apex court came only after the submission of the nomination papers by Mr Sharif. 
Therefore, he added, Mr Sharif could not benefit from the SC decision in a retrospective manner. The bench dismissed the petition and upheld the decisions of the RO and the appellate tribunal in favour of Mr Sharif. 
The bench then also accepted a petition of Advocate Chaudhry to allow him to contest from NA-130.

4,ECP had no power to take away PTI’s ‘bat’: PHC,"In detailed order on PTI petition challenging ECP decision of revoking electoral symbol, court says commission can’t question intra-party elections.","PESHAWAR: The Election Com­mission of Pakistan (ECP) has no jurisdiction to issue a decision on political parties’ intra-party elections, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) has ruled.
On Saturday, PHC issued a detailed order on PTI’s petition challenging ECP’s decision of not allotting the party its election symbol ‘bat’.
The detailed verdict came three days after a two-member bench, comprising Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Syed Arshad Ali, overruled ECP’s decision.
In their order, the judges ruled that a political party has the right to contest elections under a common symbol and this constitutional right can’t be denied to it on the basis of an “absurd provision of law”.
“The impugned decision of the ECP is backed by no legal provision either under the Act [Elections Act] or under the Constitution. Therefore, the same is illegal,” said the 26-page detailed judgement.

In detailed order, court says commission can’t question intra-party elections

While setting aside the ECP’s order of Dec 22, the bench had also directed the ECP to publish ‘bat’ as PTI’s symbol on its website.
Overruling the ECP’s objection about PHC jurisdiction, the bench discussed different judgments of the superior courts and concluded that the PTI’s party elections took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; therefore, PHC and the Islamabad High Court have concurrent jurisdictions in the matter.
Referring to past precedents set by superior courts, the bench ruled: “The survey of the case law stated above and the enabling provision of the Constitution, as well as the Act, lead us to the conclusion that it is the fundamental right of every citizen of Pakistan not only to form political party but the political party should be provided a conducive atmosphere to contest election for the Parliament, Provincial Assembly, Senate and to form a Government.”
The judgement, authored by Justice Ali, added that different provisions of the Constitution and the Elections Act were discussed, and the outcome of that discussion was that ECP’s action of refusing PTI its symbol has “the effect of depriving the petitioners and its members to freely participate in the affairs and governance of Pakistan through political activities as guaranteed through Article 17(2) of the Constitution”.
“Indeed, the Constitution of 1973 has ensured that every citizen in Pakistan has the right to form or to be a member of a political party subject to any reasonable restriction imposed by law in the interest of sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan.”
The bench also discussed ECP’s jurisdiction to question, probe and issue an order on intra-party election disputes.
About section 208 of the Elections Act, dealing with intra-party polls, the bench observed: “The verbiage of Section 208 does not authorise the ECP either to supervise the intra-party election or entertain any complaint regarding any irregularity in the said election”.
However, it added that under Section 209, a political party is bound to submit a certificate signed by office-bearers with the ECP within seven days of the intra party polls to establish that they were held in accordance with the party’s constitution of a political party and the Elections Act.
The court further ruled that it was ECP’s “statutory duty” to publish the party’s symbol on its website within seven days of the submission of intra-party documents.
“Section 209 of the Elections Act, 2017 does not confer any jurisdiction on the ECP to question the intra-party election process.”
The bench added that any party who has complied with sections 202, 206, 209 and 210 of the Elections Act 2017 “becomes eligible for an election symbol for contesting election” for national, provincial and local assemblies.
The said sections deal with the enlistment of political parties with the ECP, intra-party elections and declaration of funding sources.
The order added that Section 215(5) — outlining the condition for not allocating an election symbol to a party — “can be invoked only when a political party, despite a show-cause notice, fails to comply with provision of sections 209 or 210 of the Elections Act, 2017”.

5,ECP orders ROs to ‘checkmate’ PTI’s ‘Plan B’,• Watchdog says bid to ‘deceive’ commission will be seen as breach of law • PTI-N’s Dar refutes agreement with Imran’s party,"• Watchdog says bid to ‘deceive’ commission will be seen as breach of law
• PTI-N’s Dar refutes agreement with Imran’s party
• Raoof vows not to back off from contesting elections
ISLAMABAD  / LAHORE: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has barred  returning officers (ROs) from allotting election symbols of a party to  the candidates of another party.
The orders were issued on Saturday to counter PTI’s plan to forge an alliance with its splinter group, PTI-Nazriati (PTI-N), and use the latter’s symbol, ‘batsman’, for its candidates.
“Whoever  has PTI-Nazriati tickets should immediately submit them and take any  kind of hindrance to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and high  courts,” a post on PTI’s official X account said on Saturday. 
In its  order, the electoral watchdog prohibited candidates from seeking  election symbols affiliated with parties other than their own.
“Numerous  applications from candidates, attempting to manipulate the system, have  flooded the Election Commission, prompting concerns of deception and  violations of electoral laws,” it said.
The order stated that any attempt to deceive the ECP would be tantamount to a breach of law.
Referring  to the Election Act, the commission highlighted that a candidate must  present a party affiliation certificate and added that an individual  cannot simultaneously belong to more than one political party.
In a  related development, PTI leader Shoaib Shaheen submitted a request to  the ECP to accept PTI-N’s tickets awarded to his party’s candidates.
The  plea stated that PTI’s candidates were facing troubles in filing PTI-N  tickets and urged the ECP to give instructions to the ROs.
PTI-N’s ‘change of heart’
However,  PTI’s manoeuvring apparently hit a snag as  PTI-N chief Akhtar Iqbal Dar denied his party allowed any other group to  use its electoral symbol.
“PTI-N has nothing to do with PTI  candidates, and any tickets issued using my party’s election symbol  [batsman] are fake, and the ECP should take notice of this forgery,” Mr  Dar said while speaking at a news conference at the Lahore Press Club on  Saturday.
When Mr Dar was shown his party’s ticket issued to a PTI  candidate at the presser, he denied that the document carried his  signatures.
Answering a question, the PTI-N leader denied that he was doing the presser under pressure from any quarter.
Mr  Dar also distanced himself from an alleged seat adjustment agreement on  seven seats reached between the two parties last month and claimed he  hadn’t met any PTI leader in the recent past.
Under the alleged  agreement, both parties’ candidates were supposed to contest the  election on PTI-N’s election symbol and follow PTI founder chairman  Imran Khan’s instructions.
Stating that the party’s slogan is “death  for corruption”, Mr Dar labelled all three major political parties —  PTI, PML-N and PPP — as corrupt.
He said he had joined the PTI in 2007 and, in a matter of few years, found the party to be “corrupt”, and thus, he parted ways.
PTI’s reaction
PTI has termed Mr Dar’s presser a continuity of such press talk “under duress from the powers that be”.
The PTI announced that it will contest the Feb 8 elections whether it gets ‘bat’ as a symbol or not.
“I  want to make it clear that we will be in the election as a party or  independent candidates. We will not announce the boycott of the election  come what may,” the party’s central information secretary Raoof Hasan  said while talking to Dawn.
“It is unfortunate that we saw several  press conferences during the last eight months which were a clear  example of the collapse of the constitution and ineffectiveness of our  judiciary,” he alleged.
Mr Hasan claimed his party had signed the agreement with Mr Dar some 15 days ago, and both party’s leaders signed it.
At  the time of the agreement, Mr Dar had said that PTI was striving for a  noble cause and assured his full support for the cause, claimed the PTI leader.

6,"Two policemen, Levies official martyred in Quetta in 24 hours","In one of the attacks, Constable Afzal was fatally shot; another constable Muhammad Iqbal shot on polio campaign duty.","QUETTA: Two police constables and a Levies official were martyred in separate incidents within a span of 24 hours, officials said on Saturday.
In one of the attacks that occurred in the Satellite Town area of the provincial capital, a Balochistan Constabulary constable, Muha­mmad Afzal, was fatally shot.
Police officials said Constable Afzal was on his way to Balochistan University for his duty when he was ambushed by unidentified armed motorcyclists on Makran Road.
“The assailants used automatic weapons, killing him (Constable Afzal) on the spot,” police officials said.
Following the attack, police units promptly arrived at the location, transferring the deceased officer’s body to the civil hospital. 
Constable Afzal, who suffered multiple bullet wounds, was deployed on security duty at Balochistan University.
This incident marked the second fatal shooting of a police officer in Quetta within a day.
Another police constable, Muhammad Iqbal, who was on polio campaign duty, was shot and critically injured by armed individuals. Constable Iqbal, originally from Dera Ghazi Khan, later died of injuries in the hospital on Saturday. “We are investigating both the attacks,” a senior police officer said.
In a related incident, a Levies official was martyred by armed assailants in Pishin. The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pak­istan clai­med responsibility for the attack.
Since the start of the year, militants have targeted security forces, especially those deployed for the protection of anti-polio vaccination teams. On Monday, an explosive device targeted a vehicle carrying police personnel for escorting polio vaccinators in Mamond tehsil.
Six cops were martyred and 28 were wounded in the attack. The truck was carrying cops from the police line for deploying them to perform duty with vaccinators on the first day of the anti-polio campaign when it was hit by a roadside improvised explosive device in the Billoot area.
The incident was the deadliest single act of terrorism against the people involved in vaccination. The incident, the first of its kind in the current year, marks the list of endless series of killing of police and vaccinators.
