0,Gohar Ejaz eyes $100bn exports with new zone,Caretaker commerce minister says new industrial zone to be aligned with international standards.,"KARACHI: Caretaker Commerce Minister Gohar Ejaz has said that exports will cross $100 billion in the next five years if the 10,000-acre new industrial zone in Karachi is materialised, which will also create three million new jobs.
Addressing the business community at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) on Saturday, Mr Gohar said the new industrial zone would be aligned with international standards.
The business community can simply triple its earnings if it plays its due role in the accomplishment of targets set by the economic team of the government,  he said, adding that it is a win-win situation. 
According to FPCCI’s press release, Mr Gohar shared his deep concerns over the state of Pakistan’s economy; specifically, trade deficit, rupee depreciation, low number of active tax filers, anomalies in Afghan transit trade, reliance on the external sources of financing and dearth of the active participation of the business community in the policy-making.
The minister also offered his full support in taking top economists on board as advisers of FPCCI to formulate its policy recommendations.
Provincial Caretaker Minister of Commerce for Punjab S.M. Tanveer stressed that FPCCI should establish a credible, functioning and productive research and development (R&D) structure so that the federal and provincial governments incorporate its recommendations in budgetary, industrial, trade, agricultural, monetary, taxation, SME and infrastructure development policies.
FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh said the apex chamber has decided to support the government’s initiatives for achieving the $100bn export target, documentation of the economy and stabilising rupee-dollar parity.
“The FPCCI is going to announce its R&D structure in the next 10 days to turn the chamber into a top consultative body for the government,” he said.
Mr Atif also proposed that the business community should embark on a mission to accelerate exports by being competitive, holding single-country exhibitions for major export destinations, diversifying its export basket and creating an effective liaison and consultative process with the government.

1,Volatile period for exchange rate: experts,"“We expect the local currency to be anchored around the Rs280 level till before the elections with temporary outruns on both sides,” says analyst.","KARACHI: The election period is challenging for the government to maintain the exchange rate since the political uncertainty would cast its shadow over it, said financial experts.
“Pakistan has somewhat salvaged the cash flow crises, courtesy of IMF’s fresh tranche, but navigating around the election period will prove to be a challenge,” said Tresmark CEO Faisal Mamsa.
There are lots of positives in the first few days of the new year including improved remittances, prospects of current account surplus, seriousness in privatisation and tax reforms, etc. Markets are calmer with price action in the bond markets reflecting a cut in interest rates, a rally in Eurobonds and a stronger rupee.
“But what happens in the next couple of months is anyone’s guess, some of which can be reflected in Pakistan’s CDS (Credit Deposit Swap) which though lower is still amongst the most elevated in the world,” he said.
The exchange rate, inflation and interest rate remained top of the agenda of discussions in the financial sector. Most of the speculations remained around the general elections scheduled to be held on Feb 8.
The rupee is expected to strengthen around Rs280 against the dollar in the interbank market. It was witnessed the appreciating PKR has compelled exporters to sell their holdings and whatever they would earn in the coming days and weeks.
One of the main reasons for the rupee strength was the inflows of export proceeds which provided enough support to the interbank market.
The main driver was exporters selling dollars in forward in large volumes. This was further accelerated by stronger SBP reserves and IMF’s approval for the release of $700m tranche. From the price action last week, analysts are of the view that the central bank is supporting the Rs280 level and any time it trades below it may only be temporary. Even during the last period of rupee consolidation, the dollar remained below Rs280 for only 12 days.
“We expect the local currency to be anchored around the Rs280 level till before the elections with temporary outruns on both sides,” said Mr Faisal.
Bankers said despite stability in the exchange rate, the confidence of overseas Pakistanis in the economy is shaky. The inflow of remittances increased year-on-year by 13.4pc in December 2023 but declined 6.8pc in the first half of 2023-24. So far the caretaker government has not paid attention towards the declining remittances despite making an effort to increase the foreign exchange reserves of the country through borrowing from multilateral lending agencies.

2,Uncertainty dampens sales of election-related items,Manufacturers face challenges; PTI’s absence cuts production by 35pc; PPP leads in placing orders.,"KARACHI: With the general elections just 24 days away, the sale of campaign-related items, such as panaflex, cloth banners, buntings, caps, and badges, has remained dull owing to the looming uncertainty regarding whether the polls will be held on the announced date, manufacturers said.
They said, perhaps, the political parties and even the people are also uncertain about the February 8 elections. 
Sheikh Nisar Parchamwala, Chief Executive of VIP Flags at the Paper Market, mentioned that while some orders have started arriving in the last few days, but the “election environment is lacking compared to the 2018 polls, amid anxiety among stakeholders in the printing industry and perhaps among candidates from various political parties regarding the holding of elections”.
However, printing work for flags and other items has been ongoing for the past month in a few constituencies in the city and in the interior of Sindh.

Manufacturers face challenges; PTI’s absence cuts production by 35pc; PPP leads in placing orders

“Our production capacity has been hit by 30-35 per cent in the 2024 polls due to absence of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) from the election scene owing to the issue of [its electoral symbol] ‘bat’, which has not yet been handed over to the party,” he said, fearing the potential waste of investment made in making PTI’s symbol-related election items without even getting any advance order from the PTI.
Currently, the ongoing work on producing flags, buntings, caps, badges, etc, sees the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) taking the lead in placing orders or acquiring finished items.
“This year, the orders for various items from the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) have arrived, which was nominal last year,” he said.
“Our sales of flags will only improve in case the PTI gets its bat symbol back,” he hoped.
He mentioned that preparation for elections and related items usually begins six to eight months before the elections. The manufacturers will face a deep financial loss if sales of finished items fail to pick up or remain unsold.
Another main issue contributing to lacklustre sales is the lack of political rallies by the contesting parties. If these activities resume, it will have a positive impact on the sales of election-related items, he said.
Mr Nisar noted a new trend among political parties, with orders being placed for the “mufflers or scarves” introduced by the PTI last year. Each muffler costs Rs80-90.
In the flag category, the popular size is 2x3ft, priced at Rs80-90 each, compared to Rs60-65 last year; its double size is available at Rs130-140. Caps are now priced at Rs50-55, up from Rs30-35 in 2018, while badges are priced at Rs10-20, an increase from Rs5-7 per badge.
Mr Nisar claimed that campaign-related items are 30-35pc cheaper in Punjab due to low quality. However, manufacturers in Karachi are facing a deep gas crisis and a significant rise in gas tariffs.
He claimed that he has over 50,000 of different size of PTI flags and other items carrying symbol of bat. “We will face a huge loss in case the PTI fails to get relief from the Supreme Court,” he added.
M. Altamash Feroz, Proprietor of Al Baqi Graphics at Burns Road, mentioned that only 10-15pc of panaflex sales activities are ongoing.
“Currently, only seven to eight customers arrive to order panaflex banners, compared to 100 a day prior to the 2018 elections,” he said.
“We are receiving orders solely for PPP panaflex items, with almost no orders from other parties, and hardly any orders for PTI panaflex,” he said.
Mr Feroz noted a decline in the political interest of young boys aged 20-22. He explained, “The high cost of living, including elevated food prices, utility bills, and house rents, has created numerous problems in many homes. Parents are urging the younger generation to focus more on securing jobs to meet increasing household expenses rather than participating in political activities.”
“Elections typically bring substantial business prospects, but in the 2024 polls, we are losing every opportunity for good sales,” he added.Mohammad Dawood Khan of Decent Printers at Al Karam Square, Liaquatabad, mentioned that the screen printing of banners has accounted for only 20pc, as most of the work has shifted to machines. However, there is minimal work for PTI, while banner production is ongoing for PPP and other parties.

3,Fed posts worst loss ever,"Fed’s expenses exceed estimated earnings by 114.3 billion, central bank announces.","WASHINGTON: The US Federal Reserve posted its biggest ever operating loss last year, it announced Friday, as the impact of higher interest rates caused its interest expense to surge.
The Fed began rapidly raising the benchmark lending rate in March 2022 as policymakers looked to puncture a surge in prices that pushed inflation well above its long-term target of two percent.
Policymakers swiftly lifted rates to a 22-year high, and have held them steady since then, leading to a sharp rise in the cost of interest the US central bank pays out to banks that store their money at the Fed.
As a result, the Fed’s expenses exceeded its estimated earnings by 114.3 billion, the central bank announced in a statement.
However, although the Fed incurred its worst-ever operating loss in 2023, it does not need to ask the Congress — or the Treasury Department — for more money to make ends meet.

4,Amendments proposed to NBFC regulations,"Proposed changes based on comprehensive review of regulations, considering advancements in NBFC ecosystem.","ISLAMABAD: To ensure a more conducive regulatory framework, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has proposed amendments to the Non-Banking Finance Companies (Establishment & Regulations) Rules 2003 to solicit public feedback.
The proposed changes are based on a comprehensive review of the regulations, considering the advancements in the NBFC ecosystem and the effectiveness of mandatory approval requirements.
The modifications include the removal of approval processes for the rate of profit on subordinated loans and the repayment of subordinated loans.
While the provision mandating the application for a licence within six months of the rules’ notification has been omitted being obsolete.
The necessity for the submission of an undertaking by the company’s promoters or majority shareholders for the sale or transfer of shares without prior approval from the Commission has been eliminated as it is no longer deemed necessary.
The requirement for furnishing evidence of qualifications and experience for individuals occupying “executive positions, research, or other related functions” within both existing and new companies is considered excessive and has been omitted.
As technological advancements have been achieved to a considerable level within financial services, the SECP has said that digital-specific licencing requirements have been introduced for lending and microfinance services through digital channels including mobile applications.
The other additional requirements include identifying major shareholders and funding sources and providing an undertaking on fund sources.
The rules once amended will require an NBFC to maintain membership in the relevant microfinance association, while providing a conducive environment Schedule-I has been amended, allowing existing company(s) an opportunity to convert to an NBFC.

5,Political turmoil mars economic positivity on PSX,"KSE-100 index closes at 64,638 points after gaining 123 points or 0.2pc week-on-week.","KARACHI: Growing uncertainties amid renewed calls by lawmakers seeking a delay in general elections kept fuelling investor nervousness and overshadowed positive developments on the economic front in the outgoing week. However, the equities managed modest gains to close the second consecutive week of the new year on a positive note.
After adopting a resolution by a thinly-attended Senate session on Jan 5 seeking a delay in general elections on security grounds, the Senate Secretariat on Friday received a fresh resolution demanding a three-month delay on similar grounds.
Arif Habib Ltd, however, said the local market maintained a range-bound trajectory throughout the week. Positive economic developments included the approval of the second Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) tranche by the IMF’s Executive Board, amounting to $700m. This approval is expected to provide crucial economic stabilisation to the country.
Furthermore, the remittances for December 2023 reached $2.4bn, reflecting a substantial 13 per cent year-on-year and 5pc month-on-month increase. Furthermore, there was a notable decline in cut-off yields for the three-year, 5-year, and 10-year Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) by 45 basis points, 44bps and 59bps, respectively.
Meanwhile, the SBP’s reserves declined by $66m to $8.1bn during the week ended on Jan 5. However, the rupee continued its bullish spell against the US dollar closing the outgoing week at Rs280.36 appreciating 0.37pc week-on-week.
As a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,638 points after gaining 123 points or 0.2pc week-on-week.
Sector-wise positive contributions came from oil & gas exploration companies (242 points), fertiliser (214 points), automobile assemblers (56 points), miscellaneous (38 points), and engineering (9 points). Meanwhile, the sectors which mainly contributed negatively were commercial banks (173 points), cement (88 points), technology and communication (84 points), oil and gas marketing companies (38 points), and refinery (27 points).
Scrip-wise positive contributors were Engro Corporation (111 points), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (106 points), Mari Petroleum Ltd (103 points), Engro Fertisers Ltd (75 points) and Indus Motor Ltd (70 points).
Meanwhile, scrip-wise negative contributions came from United Bank Ltd (58 points), Meezan Bank Ltd (49 points), TRG Pakistan Ltd (35 points), Systems Ltd (32 points), and D.G. Khan Cement (25 points).
Going forward, Arif Habib Ltd expects the index to remain positive in the coming week. The prime minister has written a letter to the UAE government requesting the rollover of a $2bn loan, which is scheduled to mature in the upcoming week. A successful rollover would improve SBP’s foreign reserves position which will boost investor confidence.

6,"ANALYSIS: The ‘need’ to fix violations of gas royalties, NFC award",Business community eyes election manifestos to end fiscal uncertainty.,"The major political parties are set to unveil their election manifestos in the coming week, merely three weeks before the general elections on Feb 8. Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are not receiving their rightful gas royalties from the federal government and there is a recurring violation of the constitutional National Finance Commission (NFC) Award. 
However, politicians are focused on winning over constituents through popular rhetoric, while other stakeholders, including the business community, are highlighting these violations.
Political parties use catchy slogans like building houses and generating jobs, not constitutional infractions to protect provinces’ rights to resources and the level playing field for businesses. Manifestos are the litmus test for major political parties—PTI, PPP and PML-N. Manifestos will disclose whether there is a discussion or a way to resolve these issues, rather than simply paying lip service. 
After the 18th Amendment, the two provinces protested about not receiving enough oil and gas royalties. The federal government is reluctant to settle this issue. Since 2018, the 7th NFC Award has been violated by depriving the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of their rights. The spirit of NFC was tarnished by the federal government’s decision to impose a petroleum development levy (PDL) while ceasing to collect sales taxes since 2022 on petroleum products. The decision also reduced the transfer of resources to provinces under the NFC award.

Business community eyes election manifestos to end fiscal uncertainty

Gas royalty
Article 158 mandates that in the case of natural gas, as against the mineral and oil, the province in which a well-head is situated shall have precedence over other parts of Pakistan in meeting the requirement from the well-head situated in that particular province.
Contrary to this, the federal government has fixed a uniform rate for Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Ltd (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Ltd (SSGCL). The price of gas for industry has been hiked from Rs1,238 mmBtu to Rs2,400 mmBtu. Both provinces—Sindh and KP – produce more gas than they need, and the choice to mix imported RLNG has driven up the cost significantly. As a result of the decision to supply blended gas to enterprises in KP and Sindh, the price of industrial gas further went up to Rs3,200 mmBtu for industries.
Many businesses, notably those involved in textile production, were forced to shut down as a result of this constitutional infringement in these two provinces. The caretaker government of KP and the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry were vocal in their opposition to these infractions.  
First violation
Concerns exist that the devolution plan and NFC Award will be undone. It was feared under the PML-N from 2013 to 2018 and then PTI from 2019 to 2022. The only major political party supporting decentralisation while in opposition was the PPP. After joining the PDM in 2022, the PPP did not make any effort to enforce the constitution during its 16-month rule.
Since May 2021, the government has steadily cut sales tax on petroleum, which was abolished in Dec 2021. Sales tax on POL products ended in February 2022, effectively denting the revenue share of provinces.
To compensate, the federal government collects PDL, with an FY24 target of Rs1 trillion. If petroleum goods have a sales tax, provinces should have received half of this money. Since the PDL levy, PPP has made few statements when remained in power. 
Second violation
After the 25th Amendment, the federal government is reluctant to increase the province’s divisible pool share from 14.62 to 19.64pc in the wake of Fata-KP merger. Previously, KP owned 14.62pc and Fata 5.02pc. JUI-F was the only political party opposed to this merger, but it showed that the government’s plan was bad for the region’s development and NFC contribution. The major parties ignored this infringement, but the KP caretaker government frequently raised it with the PDM and eventually the caretaker federal government.
Centre’s concerns
There is no income tax or sales tax on the agriculture sector, which accounts for 21pc of GDP and is provincially regulated. The provinces are collecting a few billions in agriculture income tax, which has been a larger source of income in recent years. The political elites, supported by prominent landowners, resist agriculture taxes while severely taxing corporations.
Despite an unprecedented increase in real estate prices, provinces are failing to tax urban immovable assets. Provinces control 58pc of GDP from the services sector, with inadequate tax collection.
The question is whether this failure justifies the federal government’s continued violation of the Constitution.
One criticism against the PTI government was that it would rescind the devolution law, but even the PMLN-led coalition government did not do anything to stop these constitutional violations.
With a plan to ‘reform’ the 18th Amendment, the PMLN will share its manifesto on Jan 15 whereas the PPP’s document is also eagerly awaited, barring the 10-point agenda shared by its chairperson. Similarly, the PTI manifesto is still awaited.
These political parties must provide a clear path from resource allocation to federal and provincial tax hikes, not constitutional breaches.
