“We have a ceiling of 13,500 troops authorised by the Security Council, as of April 30th, with the start of the withdrawal underway, we will reach 11,500,” Bintou Keita, head of the mission, told a joint press conference with government officials.
The UN Security Coun­cil approved the end of the mission in December following a request by Con­golese President Felix Tshi­sekedi in September to fast-track the withdrawal of the peacekeepers.
The currently 13,500-strong force, known as MONUSCO, took over from an earlier UN operation in 2010 to help quell insecurity in the east of the Central African country, where armed groups fight over territory and resources. But in recent years, its presence has become increasingly unpopular for what critics say is a failure to protect civilians against militia groups, sparking deadly protests.
The first of three withdrawal phases will begin in South Kivu province, she said, adding that 14 UN bases in the province will be taken over by Congolese security forces.
UN peacekeeping forces will later withdraw from the North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the next phases. Congolese Foreign Minister Christophe Lutundula told the press conference in the capital Kinshasa that the remaining UN forces are expected to be out of the country by Dec 31.
“The withdrawal of MONUSCO does not necessarily mean the end of the fight we are undertaking to protect the territorial interests of our country, we must continue to struggle,” Lutundula said.
More than 7 million people have been displaced due to conflicts in Congo, mostly in the three eastern provinces where a myriad of armed groups continue to operate.

Ardern, 43, and Gayford, 47, got engaged in May 2019 and were meant to be married in early 2022, but the ceremony was cancelled due to her go hard, go early approach to the pandemic, which allowed New Zealand to keep deaths from the virus low.
She became a global icon for left-leaning politics and women in leadership as prime minister from 2017 to January last year. Ardern, one of just two women to have a baby as national leaders, took her daughter to a United Nations meeting.
The wedding took place in Hawke’s Bay at Craggy Range Winery on the east coast of New Zealand’s North Island, about 310 km north of the capital Wellington, an Ardern spokesperson said by email.

2,"Russia strikes Ukraine with 40 missiles, drones","Most of the types of missile used overnight were extremely fast-moving ballistic types, air force says.","KYIV: Ukraine suffered a large Russian missile attack in the early hours of Saturday, while its air defences were able to down a far lower proportion of them than usual.
According to Ukraine’s air force, Russia launched 37 missiles and three drones. Eight missiles were downed, it said in a statement on social media. The air force’s spokesperson said earlier this week that Ukraine was now suffering from a deficit of air defence missiles. It was not immediately clear whether this or any other factor was the reason for the low hit rate.
Most of the types of missile used overnight were extremely fast-moving ballistic types, the air force said. These are far harder to shoot down.
“It should be noted that more than 20 of all the listed (weapons) which were not included in the number of the downed, did not reach their targets as a result of active countermeasures by electronic warfare,” the statement said. There were no details on the targets of the strike.
Air defences shot down Russian missiles in at least five regions across Ukraine, according to local officials from those provinces.
The large south-eastern city of Dnipro was struck, the local governor said, also without providing detail as to what was hit. Police in the northern region of Chernihiv posted a picture of a large crater made by a downed missile.
“As a result of being hit by the debris of an enemy missile, several private homes and non-residential buildings were damaged, one buil­ding was practically destroyed,” the police wrote. No people were hurt but a dog was killed, police said.
France’s priority
France’s  new foreign minister Stephane Sejourne on Saturday renewed his  country’s support to Ukraine, choosing Kyiv for his first official visit  abroad, as the war with Russia nears a second anniversary.
Sejourne  arrived as Ukraine saw another wave of overnight strikes from Russia,  which has intensified its aerial attacks recently. The visit took  place as allies struggle to secure funding, with some worrying that Kyiv  could be forgotten amid new conflicts, including between Israel and  Hamas.
“Despite the multiplying crisis, Ukraine is and will remain  France’s priority,” Sejourne, who was due to meet President Volodymyr  Zelensky later, said. The freshly-appointed foreign minister  explained that  “the fundamental principles of international law and the  values of Europe, as well as the security interests of the French” were  at stake in Ukraine.
Sejourne, 38, who unlike his predecessor  Catherine Colonna has no background as a professional diplomat, had  already pledged continued support. He also met with Prime Minister Denys Shmygal, Vice Prime Minister Olga Stefanishyna and Parliament Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk.
Shmygal  said he was  “grateful for (France’s) comprehensive help in the fight  against the aggressor and the support on our way to the EU and Nato” on  social media. Aid promised to Ukraine between August and October  2023 fell almost 90 per cent from the same period in 2022, reaching its  lowest point since the start of the war, according to a Kiel Institute  survey from December.
An EU aid package worth 50 billion euros  ($55 billion) has been stuck in Brussels, while the US Congress remains  divided on sending additional aid to Ukraine.
“Russia hopes Ukraine and its  supporters will get tired before it does. We will not falter,” Sejourne  added. But Russia, bolstering its arsenal, has geared up for a long war and reoriented its economy. It has in recent weeks intensified its aerial assaults on the war-torn country.

3,Landslide claims 33 lives in Colombia,"BOGOTA: At least 33 people, mostly children, were killed in a landslide in an indigenous community in northwestern...","BOGOTA: At least 33 people, mostly children, were killed in a landslide in an indigenous community in northwestern Colombia, the country’s vice president said on Saturday. “I deeply regret the death of 33 people in this tragedy, mostly children, according to preliminary reports from the territory,” Vice President Francia Marquez wrote on social media site X, the former Twitter.
Earlier, officials had put the toll in Friday’s landslide, which hit a road linking the cities of Medellin and Quibdo in Choco department, at 23 dead and 20 injured.
“All the help available (is being sent) to Choco in this horrible tragedy,” President Gustavo Petro said on social media.
The landslide in Choco, which lies on the Pacific Ocean and is home to a vast tropical forest, followed more than 24 hours of intense rain. Images shared on social networks and on television channels showed part of a mountain detaching and crashing down onto a line of cars, while screams are heard. While much of Colombia is suffering a period of drought, the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies has warned of the risk of heavy rains in the Amazon and in several departments bordering the Pacific.

Flight 1182 was en route to Toyama airport but headed back to the Sapporo-New Chitose airport after the crack was found on the outermost of four layers of windows surrounding the cockpit, the spokesperson said, adding there were no injuries reported among the 59 passengers and six crew.
The aircraft was not one of Boeing’s 737 MAX 9 airplanes. These have been in the spotlight after a cabin panel broke off a new Alaska Airlines jet in mid-air last week. “The crack was not something that affected the flight’s control or pressurisation,” the ANA spokesperson said. The US aviation regulator on Friday extended the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX 9 airplanes indefinitely for new safety checks and announced it will tighten oversight of Boeing itself.

5,"Massive trove of ancient artefacts, skeletons found in Brazil",RIO DE JANEIRO: Workers were just starting construction on a new apartment complex in northeastern Brazil when they...,"RIO DE JANEIRO: Workers were just starting construction on a new apartment complex in northeastern Brazil when they began finding human bones and pottery shards, their edges worn smooth by time.
Soon, excavations at the site in the coastal city of Sao Luis had uncovered thousands of artifacts left by ancient peoples up to 9,000 years ago — a treasure trove archaeologists say could rewrite the history of human settlement in Brazil.
The lead archaeologist on the dig, Wellington Lage, says he had no idea what he was getting into when Brazilian construction giant MRV hired his company, W Lage Arqueologia, in 2019 to carry out an impact study at the site — part of the routine procedure of preparing to build an apartment building.
Covered in tropical vegetation and bordered by the urban sprawl of Sao Luis, the capital of Maranhao state, the six-hectare (15-acre) plot was known as Rosane’s Farm, for the daughter of a late local landholder.
Researching the site, Lage learned intriguing vestiges had been found in the area since the 1970s, including part of a human jawbone in 1991. His team soon found much more: a flood of stone tools, ceramic shards, decorated shells and bones.
In four years of digging, they have unearthed 43 human skeletons and more than 100,000 artifacts, according to Brazil’s Institute for National Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN), which announced the discovery this week, calling it  “grandiose.” Researchers now plan to catalogue the artifacts, analyze them in detail, put them on display and publish their findings.
“We’ve been working four years now, and we’ve barely scratched the surface,” said Lage, a 70-year-old Sao Paulo native whose wife and two children are also archaeologists.
Rewriting history
The preliminary findings are already grabbing attention in the scientific community.
Lage says his team — which grew to 27 people in all, including archaeologists, chemists, a historian and a documentary filmmaker — has found four distinct eras of occupation at the site.
The top layer was left by the Tupinamba people, who inhabited the region when European colonizers founded Sao Luis in 1612.
Then comes a layer of artifacts typical of Amazon rainforest peoples, followed by a “sambaqui”: a mound of pottery, shells and bones used by some Indigenous groups to build their homes or bury their dead.
Beneath that, around two meters (6.5 feet) below the surface, lies another layer, left by a group that made rudimentary ceramics and lived around 8,000 to 9,000 years ago, based on the depth of the find.
That is far older than the oldest documented  “pre-sambaqui” settlement found so far in the region, which dates to 6,600 years ago, Lage said. “This could completely change the history of not just the region but all of Brazil,” he said.
Scientists have long debated exactly when and how humans arrived in and populated the Americas from Asia. Lage’s find suggests they settled this region of modern-day Brazil at least 1,400 years earlier than previously thought.

6,"Discarded Christmas trees, a gift to Stockholm’s fish","STOCKHOLM: On a freezing January morning, dozens of discarded Christmas trees collected after the holidays are ...","STOCKHOLM: On a freezing January morning, dozens of discarded Christmas trees collected after the holidays are tossed into Stockholm’s glacial waters, recycled to provide a welcoming habitat for marine life.
The initiative, started by national sport fishing association Sportfiskarna in 2016 to help restore the endangered ecosystem, has been hailed by environmentalists. All the trees collected are from retailers who buy evergreens that have not been sprayed with pesticides.
Just days ago, the majestic Norway spruces held pride of place in cosy homes across Stockholm. Now, the tinsel and ornaments are being replaced by heavy rocks before the trees are thrown off a boat into the waters off the Hammarby Sjostad industrial zone.
“Around here there’s been a lot of construction, a lot of boats going in and out,” Malin Kjellin, who heads the Sportfiskarna project, said. “There’s not a lot of vegetation and these are really important habitats for fish to spawn that have disappeared,” she says. “It’s really hard to get (the habitat) back naturally. This is a way of substituting what has been lost.” Since 2016, more than 1,000 trees collected after Christmas have been dropped in different spots. Kjellin pulled up one about to be tossed overboard.
“If you look at it, there are plenty of places to hide in here. All these branches and needles. “These are really great places to lay the roe and also for juvenile fish to hide from bigger ones,” she explained. Underwater videos of the submerged trees shot in past years show gelatinous clusters of fish larvae nestled in the branches.

7,Arab partnership on Palestine awaits Israeli commitment: US,The US aims to play a leadership role in presenting its vision for the reconstruction of Gaza.,"WASHINGTON: Arab nations are ready to collaborate with the US on both short-term and long-term solutions for Palestinians in Gaza, but this partnership is contingent upon Israel’s willingness to participate, says the US State Department.
In an interview with MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell, the department’s spokesperson Matthew Miller reviewed Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s seven-day visit to the Middle East, highlighted the willingness of Arab nations to work with the US on Palestinian issues. However, he emphasised that this cooperation depends on Israel’s commitment to the process.
“We’ve traveled to nine countries and met with leaders in each of those, securing agreements with all of these Arab partners, as well as with Turkiye,” Miller stated. “They were ready to coordinate with the United States and take real steps to improve the lives of the Palestinian people in Gaza and to rebuild Gaza, establishing Palestinian-led governance.”
Arab leaders had one condition, as Miller explained, “They were only willing to do that if they had a partner on the other side in Israel and if Israel was ready to take real concrete steps to establish an independent Palestinian state.”
Secretary Blinken’s diplomatic offensive involved visits to Turkiye, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt, and the West Bank. Miller noted that the recent trip was ‘different’ because Arab partners were now open to discussing reconstruction, security, and governance in Gaza.
Blinken had a “very candid conversation” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, discussing potential partnerships Israel could gain in the Arab world by reaching an agreement on the future of Gaza.
Miller acknowledged the need for tough choices from all parties involved, stating, “It’s going to require tough choices, not just from Arab partners but really tough choices from Israel. The United States can’t make those decisions on behalf of any country.”
The US aims to play a leadership role in presenting its vision for the reconstruction of Gaza. Blinken plans to continue advocating for progress in the region during upcoming trips in the coming weeks and months.
Blinken’s tour highlighted an evolving diplomatic landscape. Arab nations, once hesitant, are now expressing a commitment to discussions regarding the welfare and future governance of Palestinians in Gaza. However, the success of these endeavors hinges on Israel’s willingness to accept the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. The delicate balance of power and interests in the region underscores the complexity of finding a sustainable resolution to the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

LONDON: Thousands of pro-Palestine protesters marched in central London on Saturday as part of a  “global day of action” to oppose Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza.
Around 1,700 police were on duty for the march, with major demonstrations taking place in London on most Saturdays since Israel began its war against Hamas following the October 7 raid.
“We want to show the people of Palestine we are with them and to speak up against our government as well,” 27-year-old health service worker Maleeha Ahmed, who was at the march with her family, said.
“They are playing a very, very big role in allowing Israel to continue what they are doing and it’s just not acceptable,” she said.
Another marcher, Dipesh Kothar, 37, said it was  “very frustrating to sit and watch the world do nothing”.
“That’s why we come out to show support for the Palestinian people and show our unhappiness with the governments around the world,” he said.
Saturday’s march holds particular significance given the UK’s air strikes in Yemen this week against Houthi bases, after attacks by the Iran-backed militants on ships in the Red Sea in solidarity with Gaza.
Police warned protesters that they face arrest if they  “intentionally push the limit” with placards and chants. They also said that protesters must stick to the route specified and that the event must finish by 5pm.
The day of action, involving 30 countries, was called by the UK organising coalition comprising the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, the Palestinian Forum in Britain, the Stop the War Coalition, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Friends of Al Aqsa and the Muslim Association of Britain.
“Millions of people will take to the streets across the world this Saturday, to demand a permanent ceasefire and a lasting political settlement for all Palestinians,” said Kate Hudson, general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.
“The UK government must end its support for Israel’s brutal war in Gaza, and join the wider international community in condemning its war crimes,” she said.

9,UNSC members uphold right of Palestinians to stay in Gaza,"Situation in the Palestinian territory “is heart-breaking and untenable,” says US ambassador to UN.","UNITED NATIONS: In a UN Security Council meeting on Friday evening, representatives unanimously called for allowing Palestinians to remain in Gaza and the West Bank, emphasising the importance of respecting international law and preventing forced displacement.
The meeting addressed the worsening situation in the Middle East, particularly focusing on the escalating conflict in Gaza and rising tensions around the Red Sea.
As the war in Gaza approached the 100-day mark, key figures and representatives voiced serious concerns about the situation in the Palestinian enclave and rejected any move to displace Palestinians from their lands.
With over 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza internally displaced, the situation in the Palestinian territory “is heart-breaking and untenable,” said US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield.
“The US position has been clear and consistent – Palestinian civilians in Gaza must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow,” she said, noting that her country has also made it clear that “civilians must not be pressed to leave Gaza under any circumstances.”
Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield drew attention to an “unprecedented rise” in violence in the West Bank. “The US strongly opposes the advancement of settlements in the West Bank, and we strongly oppose the violence that has come to characterise them,” she said. “At their core, settlements undermine the geographic viability of a two-state solution, exacerbate tensions and further harm trust between Israelis and Palestinians.”
Nicolas de Rivière, Ambassador of France, which holds the Council presidency for January, emphasised another key point. “We must work towards a Palestinian State,” he said, adding that efforts must focus immediately towards a lasting ceasefire, with the help of all regional and international partners.
“The Palestinian Authority has a central role to play in this process, in the West Bank as in Gaza, which aims to be part of this Palestinian State,” he added.
UK Ambassador Barbara Wood­ward said Britain “firmly rejects any statements proposing that Palestinians should be resettled outside of Gaza, including those by members of the Israeli government.”
“Ahead of a permanent ceasefire, we want to see immediate and sustained humanitarian pauses,” she added.
“Gaza is a stain on humanity’s conscience,” said Chinese Ambassador Zhang Jun. “We need robust action to end the conflict. Any forced displacement of Palestinians must be firmly rejected.”
Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council that “efforts are underway to prevent the mass deportation of Palestinians from their land.” He stressed that occupying Palestinian lands “have clear obligations” to protect the people living there.
Riyad Mansour, Permanent Observer of the Observer State of Palestine to the UN, thanked South Africa for presenting its case against Israel for alleged genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), stating that the lesson of the Holocaust is to stand against atrocities, regardless of the perpetrator.
He also called for an “immediate ceasefire to prevent a regional escalation of the  crisis,” stressing the urgency of saving Palestinian children’s lives.
UN Humanitarian Affairs Chief Martin Griffiths reiterated the demand, stating, “Any persons displaced from Gaza must be allowed to return, as international law demands.” He emphasised the need for a ceasefire and expressed deep concern about recent statements by Israeli ministers regarding plans for mass civilian transfer from Gaza to third countries.
Assistant Secretary General for Human Rights, Ilze Brands Kehris, warned against compelled evacuations, stating that they could potentially amount to forcible transfer, constituting a war crime. She spoke about an alarming rise in violence by Israeli settlers and security personnel in the West Bank and condemned statements from Israeli politicians hinting at the permanent resettlement of Palestinians overseas.
Algerian Ambassador Amar Bendjama emphasised, “Silence is complicity,” urging the international community to speak out against the displacement of Palestinians. In a resounding consensus, the international community within the UN Security Council called for urgent measures to end the conflicts, protect civilians, and pave the way for lasting peace in the Middle East.
The clear message persuaded Israeli Ambassador Gilad Erdan to assure the international community that there would be ‘no forced displacement.’ “Israel has no intention of displacing the population in Gaza,” he added.
The Palestinian envoy said it’s “a supremacist, racist, criminal and delusional vision that somehow Palestinians accept death, exodus or subjugation.”
Stressing that the Palestinian people “are here to stay and that they have a right to live in freedom and dignity in their ancestral land,” he said that this was the “only path” towards shared peace and security.

“We are a people that love life, despite death, murders and destruction,” said her father, Mohamed Jibril.
Relatives were gathered on Friday for the wartime wedding in a tiny room at an abandoned school building in the besieged Gaza Strip’s southern city of Rafah, near the frontier with Egypt.
The city has suffered daily Israeli bombardment, and the families of both bride and groom are among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have fled the fighting further north.
“The usual preparations for marriage are not possible, and traditional ceremonies are not feasible,” said the bride’s father.  
“However, clothes are available, although they are scarce and expensive.” Afnan, 17, donning a crown of flowers and pristine white dress with stark red embroidery, and her partner Mustafa Shamlakh, 26, want to make the most of their rare chance to celebrate.
They dance and laugh as guests spray white mousse around the room. But eventually they have to face reality.The newlyweds make up part of another grim tally — those displaced by the violence, which UN estimates put at 1.9 million Palestinians out of a total population in Gaza of 2.4 million.

The protest unfolded at the heart of Washington’s power centre, encompassing iconic locations such as the White House, Freedom Plaza (the mayor’s office), the Treasury, FBI headquarters, and the old Trump Plaza. 
Chanting slogans like “Hey, hey, ho, ho, the occupation has to go”, a united crowd gathered in the open spaces among these buildings and spilled into adjoining streets and roads.
As the protesters paused for Asr prayers, their Jewish and Christian supporters formed a line to provide them the space they needed to pray.
Protesters highlighted the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza, chanting “no more genocide”. 
Another slogan accused US President Joe Biden of permitting genocide during his tenure, with the crowd chanting, “Hey Biden, you are committed to genocide”.
At 2.30pm, it was still too early to provide a crowd estimate, considering the rally commenced at 1.30. The march to the White House had not yet begun, but tens of thousands had already assembled.
A significant portion of the crowd simultaneously called for an intifada, chanting: “There’s only one solution, intifada revolution”, alongside the call for an immediate ceasefire.

14,Sudan govt rejects east African mediation move,AL STATE: Sudan’s army-aligned government on Saturday spurned an invitation to an east African summit and rebuked...,"AL STATE: Sudan’s army-aligned government on Saturday spurned an invitation to an east African summit and rebuked the United Nations for engaging with the commander of rival paramilitary forces.
Nine months after war broke out between the regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, the army has been losing territory while paramilitary leader Mohamed Hamdan Daglo has been touring African capitals in a boost to his diplomatic standing.
Rejecting the invitation from east African bloc IGAD to a summit in Uganda on January 18 that is also to be attended by Daglo, Sudan’s transitional sovereign council, headed by army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, insisted:  “The events in Sudan are an internal matter.” 
The bloc has repeatedly attempted to mediate between Sudan’s warring generals, but its efforts have been cold-shouldered by Burhan’s government.
In contrast, Daglo, fresh from a tour of six African capitals, said on X, formerly Twitter, that he had accepted the invitation from IGAD and would be attending the summit in Uganda.
Analysts say the army chief is growing more and more isolated diplomatically, as his troops fail to halt RSF advances.
Burhan has reacted angrily to Daglo’s growing diplomatic status, accusing African leaders who hosted him on his recent tour of complicity in atrocities against Sudanese civilians.
The war has killed more than 13,000 people, according to a conservative estimate by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project. Some 7.5 million civilians have fled the fighting, according to UN figures.
Both sides have been accused of war crimes, including the indiscriminate shelling of residential areas, torture and arbitrary detention of civilians.
The RSF has also specifically been accused of ethnically-motivated mass killings, rampant looting and the use of rape as a weapon of war.
In the eastern city of Port Sudan, which is now home to Burhan’s government, acting foreign minister Ali al-Sadiq told newly arrived UN envoy Ramtane Lamamra that Sudan  “rejects” a recent contact between UN chief Antonio Guterres and Daglo, according to a statement carried by official news agency SUNA.
