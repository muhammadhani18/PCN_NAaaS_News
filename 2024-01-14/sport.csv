0,Djokovic primed for more success in new era at Australian Open,The world number one also enters the tournament as the last of the ‘Big Three’ still standing.,"MELBOURNE: Novak Djokovic begins his Australian Open title defence against qualifier Dino Prizmic when the expanded Grand Slam kicks off on Sunday with few betting against him adding a record-extending 11th crown to his trophy cabinet in just over two weeks’ time. 
The world number one also enters the tournament as the last of the ‘Big Three’ still standing, following the retirement of Swiss maestro Roger Federer in 2022 and the continued absence of his other fierce rival Rafa Nadal due to injury. 
Melbourne Park is preparing for its first tournament in 25 years without either Federer or Nadal but those fans hoping for a new champion to begin a new era may be left wanting as Djokovic eyes a 25th major to surpass Margaret Court’s haul. 
“I’m just hoping I can start the season in a way I’ve been starting most of my seasons throughout my career — with a win in Australia, in Melbourne. My favourite place, no doubt,” Djokovic told reporters on Saturday. 
“The court where I’ve done great things and achieved my greatest Grand Slam results. I hope that I’m going to be able to, if not play at the level that I did last year, then be very close to that because that was one of the best tennis levels that I’ve ever played, here in Australia last year.” 
The Australian Open has had an extra day added to the schedule this year as organisers bid to curb the late finishes that have prompted heavy criticism over the years. 
But with Djokovic expected to breeze past the 18-year-old Prizmic and women’s champion Aryna Sabalenka facing qualifier Ella Seidel after him, there could be a swift end to the opening day’s proceedings on Rod Laver Arena. 
Iga Swiatek has dominated women’s tennis since the 2022 retirement of Australian Ash Barty and the four-time Grand Slam champion will also seek a fast start when she takes on 2020 winner Sofia Kenin on Monday. 
“I know she’s been playing some solid tennis. It’s not going to be easy. I’ll just get prepared the same way as usual,” said Swiatek of the American, now ranked 38. 
The Polish player has been in rip-roaring form in the new season having ended 2023 strongly by reclaiming the top ranking from Sabalenka at the WTA Finals after surrendering it during the US Open. 
The pair will be the main contenders along with Brisbane champion Elena Rybakina in a women’s field that also has a host of former champions including Naomi Osaka, Angelique Kerber and Caroline Wozniacki all returning following motherhood. 
Coco Gauff joins them as the newest entrant in the Grand Slam club following her US Open triumph and the American can mount a strong challenge having defended her Auckland title in the lead-up to the Slam. 
Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are both light on match practice this season but will attempt to dethrone Djokovic at his Australian fortress after handing the 36-year-old Serb stunning defeats last season. 
While Wimbledon champion Alcaraz has proved himself on the biggest stage, Sinner is yet to win a major and the Italian will begin his latest bid against Botic van de Zandschulp in Sunday’s opener on Rod Laver Arena. 
Alcaraz is a different player from the one who last graced the Australian hard courts as an 18-year-old ranked outside the top 30. After missing last year’s event with a hamstring injury, he is now a two-time major champion and world number two. 
“I am looking at reaching the final and hopefully playing a final against him (Djokovic),” said the 20-year-old Spaniard. 
Russia’s Medvedev, a Melbourne finalist in 2021 and 2022, kicks off against qualifier Terence Atmane, vowing to turn over a new leaf and tone down the on-court tantrums. “I want to change, I want to mature,” he said. 
Melbourne’s sizeable Greek community could be out in force to support Maria Sakkari against Nao Hibino on the main showcourt, while another crowd favourite Wozniacki meets 20th seed Magda Linette on Margaret Court Arena.

1,Pakistan look to bounce back in Hamilton,Shaheen Shah Afridi-led tourists look to improve record against New Zealand with a yet to claim T20 victory.,"HAMILTON: Pakistan seek to make a comeback when they face New Zealand in the second Twenty20 International of a five-match series here at the Seddon Park on Saturday.
After losing a high-scoring series opener by 46 runs in Auckland on Friday, the Shaheen Shah Afridi-led tourists will look to improve their record in Hamilton where they are yet to claim a T20 International victory against New Zealand, having lost three so far, and in the process level the series.
Pakistan’s main concern will be their bowling which conceded a whopping 226 runs in Auckland thanks to Daryl Mitchell’s fireworks-laden 61. All the bowlers including Shaheen — except for fast bowlers Haris Rauf (2-34) and Abbas Afridi (3-34) — remained expensive.
Meanwhile Abbas, who started his T20 International career in the Auckland game, said he performed without taking any pressure.
“It was my debut game, [but] I took no pressure whatsoever and operated while utilising my bowling skills which gave me success,” the 22-year-old Abbas said in a video released by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday.
“This was my very first outing in New Zealand conditions. The coaches had gui­ded me on how to bowl while targeting the hard line with variations, and it worked.”
Taking the prized wicket of New Zealand captain and batting maestro Kane Williamson (57) was quite satisfying for right-armer Abbas.
“Though Williamson had been dropped earlier [by Babar Azam at long-on] in the innings, I had a belief that I would dismiss him. Getting his wicket was pleasing and really exciting for me,” the Fata-born player expressed.
The young pacer said that he was looking forward to maintaining the good start.
“I will use my performance in Auckland positively for the coming games on this tour,” Abbas concluded.
Batting also let the tourists down in the series opener. Though Babar made a 35-ball 57, the former Pakistan skipper was late in accelerating the run-rate as the required rate hovered around 12-13. The momentum set by a brisk 33-run start given by openers Saim Ayub (27 off eight) and Mohammad Rizwan (25 off 14) in 2.2 overs could not be maintained as a compact New Zealand attack led by veteran paceman Tim Southee (4-25) kept things under control.
New Zealand, on the other hand, are sitting pretty and will look to resume from where they left in Auckland. 
A heartening sign for the Black Caps for today’s game is that they hold an impressive T20 International record at Seddon Park, having won nine out of 12 games at the venue, losing just two while one ended as a tie.
A strong looking batting line-up comprising the likes of Finn Allen, Devon Conway, Williamson, Mitchell, Glenn Phillips and Mark Chapman will again seek to fire on all cylinders to give the home side a solid 2-0 lead.
The 35-year-old Southee, who became the first bowler to claim 150 T20 Intern­ational wickets in Auckland, is expected to lead the New Zealand attack alongside fellow pacers Matt Henry and Adam Milne with spin back-up from Ish Sodhi. 
Meanwhile, batter Josh Clarkson was pulled out of the New Zealand squad for the third T20 against Pakistan due to a shoulder injury.
Clarkson, uncapped at T20 International level, was originally slated to replace Williamson for the third T20 slated to be held in Dunedin on Jan 17. Will Young has replaced Clarkson in the Black Caps’ squad.
Young is a regular member of New Zealand’s ODI setup, and featured in last year’s ODI World Cup in India. He has played 14 T20 Internationals, with 260 runs at an average of 20.
Williamson will miss the third T20 to manage the knee issue that has affected him for most of the last 12 months, before returning for the final two games in Christchurch on Jan 19 and 21.

2,"Sri Lanka need to improve fielding for T20 World Cup, says Hasaranga","“I have told the team at the outset that fielding will be very important,” short-format captain says.","

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka need to lift their game on fielding to have a shot at this year’s T20 World Cup title, newly installed short-format captain Wanindu Hasaranga said on Saturday.
Hasaranga is riding high after a career-best 7-19 against Zimbabwe during Thursday’s ODI decider and will be making his debut as skipper on Sunday as the 20-over leg of the tour begins.
Poor fielding has been a running problem for the Sri Lankans in white-ball cricket, with 16 dropped catches at last year’s one-day World Cup in India confining them to a second-last place finish on the points table.
“I have told the team at the outset that fielding will be very important,” he told reporters.
“No matter how well you bat or bowl, if you don’t field well then you’ll struggle to make it to the side. Fielding is non-negotiable,” he added.
“We have another five months for the World Cup... Fielding is the easiest way we can improve our cricket and it makes a lot of difference between winning and losing in T20 cricket.”
Hasaranga returned to internationals on Thursday for the first time in six months following a hamstring injury, making a splash with a new ODI bowling record for the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.
Sri Lanka have recalled veteran Angelo Mathews into the squad and he is expected to play Sunday in his first T20 since March 2021.
Opening batsman Pathum Nissa­nka was also back at training having missed the ODI series due to illness.
All three T20 matches against Zimbabwe will take place in Colombo with the series concluding on January 18.
Sri Lanka will then welcome Afghanistan for a one-off Test and six white-ball matches ahead of June’s World Cup, jointly hosted by the United States and West Indies.
Zimbabwe will be the sole full member of the International Cricket Council to miss this year’s tournament after a shock defeat to Uganda during the qualifiers.
“It’s really heartbreaking not just for me and cricketers but for the whole nation as well,” Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza told reporters.
“We are desperately trying to turn things around. I think you needed that desperation to turn things around,” he added.
“Having said that, we have learned a lot of lessons and hopefully we will make Zimbabwe cricket great again.”
Zimbabwe lost the ODI series to Sri Lanka 2-0 with one game being washed out but Raza said the return of former skipper Sean Williams, 37, would improve their chances for the 20-over matches.

3,Hetmyer left out of WI white-ball squads for Australia series,MIAMI: Left-hander Shimron Hetmyer has been left out of the West Indies ODI and Twenty20 squads for the upcoming...,"MIAMI: Left-hander Shimron Hetmyer has been left out of the West Indies ODI and Twenty20 squads for the upcoming white ball series in Australia.
West Indies, who co-host June’s Twenty20 World Cup with the United States, named squads for both the short-form series on Friday after beating England in last month’s ODI and T20 series.
Hetmyer had a poor series against England and was dropped after scores of 1 and 2 in the opening T20 games of the series.
Brandon King and Sherfane Rutherford will miss the ODI series, as they are being allowed to play in T20 franchise cricket, but will be part of a full-strength squad named for the T20 games.
Shai Hope will captain the ODI squad which includes first call-ups for Grenadian batsman Teddy Bishop and Guyanese wicket-keeper Tevin Imlach.
There are recalls to the ODI squad for all-rounders Justin Greaves and Kavem Hodge and leg-spinner Hayden Walsh.
Greaves returns after missing the recent series against England following a hamstring injury in November in the regional Super 50 Cup, where he scored 403 runs in seven innings at an average of 80.59 for the Leeward Islands.
In the T20 squad, skippered by Rovman Powell, Alzarri Joseph, who was rested for the final two games against England, comes back into the team to replace Matthew Forde.
“For the T20I series, this forms part of our crucial preparations for the upcoming T20 World Cup where we are hosts. We are hoping to build on strong overall performances against India and England and to keep improving as we approach the major tournament,” said Cricket West Indies lead selector Desmond Haynes.
On Tuesday, the two-Test series starts followed by a three-match ODI series beginning on Feb 2, and then the three T20 games commence a week later.
ODI squad: Shai Hope (captain), Alzarri Joseph, Alick Athanaze, Teddy Bishop, Keacy Carty, Roston Chase, Matthew Forde, Justin Greaves, Kavem Hodge, Tevin Imlach, Gudakesh Motie, Kjorn Ottley, Romario Shepherd, Oshane Thomas, Hayden Walsh Jr.
Twenty20 squad: Rovman Powell (captain), Shai Hope, Johnson Charles, Roston Chase, Jason Holder, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Brandon King, Kyle Mayers, Gudakesh Motie, Nicholas Pooran, Andre Russell, Sherfane Rutherford, Romario Shepherd, Oshane Thomas.

4,Australia outmuscle India at Asian Cup,Jordan Bos deservedly doubled Australia’s advantage shortly after the 70th minute.,"DOHA: Graham Arnold warned his Australia team that they must be better despite launching their Asian Cup title charge with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win over India on Saturday.  
In front of a vocal pro-Indian crowd of 36,253 at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium in Doha, Australia made hard work of the first half, squandering a few decent chances while the underdogs defended raggedly and eyed opportunities on the break.  
Jackson Irvine opened the scoring just after the restart, the moustachioed midfielder driving home from 10 yards after India goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu came for a cross only to flap it back into the danger zone.  
And 2015 Asian champions Australia were in full control from then on, as Indian legs tired and Arnold took advantage of the depth in his squad.  
Jordan Bos deservedly doubled Australia’s advantage shortly after the 70th minute.  
A matter of seconds after coming off the bench, the 21-year-old slotted home from six yards after fellow substitute Riley McGree fizzed the ball hard and low across the box from the byline.  
A mostly unremarkable contest offered one moment of regional football history, as Japan’s Yoshimi Yamashita became the first woman to referee at an Asian Cup.  
Australia were among the pre-tournament favourites but Arnold said there was room for improvement ahead of their next Group ‘B’ match, against Syria.  
The Socceroos coach was especially disappointed with their set pieces, which a physically imposing Australia have made a trademark threat.  
“I can honestly say that we have got to improve a lot more than that,” said Arnold, who took Australia to the knockout phase of the World Cup in Qatar, where they lost 2-1 to eventual champions Argentina. “One disappointment was set pieces... it’s something we need to improve on, and we will.”  
Later, China opened their campaign with a 0-0 draw against debutants Tajikistan, heaping more embarrassment on a country rocked by a football graft scandal at home. 
Finalists in 2004, China were largely outplayed by the 106th-ranked team in the world but were left fuming after a late header from Zhu Chenjie was ruled out for offside following a VAR intervention. 
The game in Doha took place just days after former China coach Li Tie appeared on national television to confess he paid bribes to get the job and was involved in match-fixing. 
The former Everton midfielder’s confession was part of a crackdown on football corruption that triggered the downfall of at least 10 senior Chinese Football Association officials. 
Hosts and defending champions Qatar beat Lebanon 3-0 on Friday in the opening game in Group ‘A’ with a brace from their prized playmaker Akram Afif and a goal from Almoez Ali.  
Following a glitzy opening ceremony with Qatar’s ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani also in attendance at the Lusail Stadium, , where a Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina beat France on penalties in the World Cup final 13 months ago, Afif put on a show of his own to kickstart their campaign with three valuable points in the bag.  
“Akram was named the most valuable player of the match, he’s a very high-quality player and he deserves that,” Qatar coach Marquez Lopez told reporters. “I was very happy with the match and how we delivered on our own pitch, the players gave 200% of what was required.”   
Qatar suffered a disastrous 2022 World Cup on the pitch, making a first-round exit after losing all three games, the worst performance by a host in the history of the competition.  
But Afif said they were ready to make a fresh start at the Asian Cup, five years after they won the continental title for the first time.  
“It was disappointing but we are proud that we played at the World Cup,” said the forward. “We have forgotten about the World Cup, we have forgotten about 2019 — we are living today in a new day. Every day is a chance to compete and to fight for a chance to hold the cup.”  
Qatar stunned Japan in the 2019 final in the United Arab Emirates, lifting the trophy after winning every game they played at the tournament.  
They went into this year’s competition only one month after changing their coach, with Marquez replacing Carlos Queiroz.  
Everything clicked into place against Lebanon, with Afif rifling in a shot on the stroke of half-time to put them ahead.  
Ali scored nine goals in the 2019 tournament and he picked up where he left off when he doubled Qatar’s lead 11 minutes after the restart, heading home a delightful cross from Mohammed Waad on the flank.   
Afif sealed the victory in stoppage time when he pounced on a botched clearance and easily accelerated past a tiring Lebanon defence before applying a calm finish to make it 3-0.

Undefeated at their Stade Velodrome home this season, Marseille went in front after just three minutes through a header from skipper Samuel Gigot. 
However, 18-year-old Jeremy Sebas ensured a point for Strasbourg with a goal in the second minute of stoppage time. 
“Sebas has enormous qualities, but we have to use him little by little. I am very happy for him, scoring his first goal at the Velodrome, it’s difficult to do better than that,” said coach Patrick Vieira.
He added: “Collec­tively, we performed very well. We remained united despite the goal conceded and with a little more success, we could have won.”
Marseille moved into fifth place in the table, three points behind Brest while Strasbourg remain in ninth spot.

The Czech reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Open last year and will be battle-hardened for his third trip to Melbourne Park after the tight two-hour contest against fellow 22-year-old Draper. 
“It’s so emotional to win my first title here,” Lehecka said, with the victory making him the first Czech to claim an ATP title since Jiri Vesely in Pune in 2020. “I’m super excited. It feels amazing, it’s a dream come true for me. I always wanted to win a trophy, so it’s even better that I won it here in Adelaide. I’m happy for the win. This is a great way to start the year.” 
In the women’s final at Memorial Drive Tennis Centre, former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia beat Russian Daria Kasatkina 6-3, 6-2 — with Ostapenko breaking serve five times in the match. 
Ostapenko’s win assures the Latvian of a return to the top 10 in the world rankings for the first time since 2018, as the 26-year-old, who reached the quarter-finals in Brisbane last week, showed impressive form before the Australian Open. 
“This is great, I had some really tough matches this week,” said Ostapenko after collecting her first title since Dubai in 2022. “I enjoyed every moment of playing here. I can’t wait to come back, it’s so nice to be in Australia.”

8,Palmer sinks Fulham to lift Chelsea gloom,LONDON: Cole Palmer fired Chelsea to a 1-0 win against west London rivals Fulham on Saturday as the inconsistent...,"LONDON: Cole Palmer fired Chelsea to a 1-0 win against west London rivals Fulham on Saturday as the inconsistent Blues bounced back from their League Cup embarrassment at Middlesbrough, even if coach Mauricio Pochettino’s men laboured in front of goal once again. 
Palmer converted a penalty late in the first half at Stamford Bridge to erase the bitter taste from Chelsea’s shock 1-0 loss against second-tier Middle­sbrough in the semi-final first leg on Tuesday. 
That League Cup calamity was just the latest disappointment in a troubled season for Pochettino’s side. 
Chelsea were hardly much more dynamic against Fulham, but Pochettino will take heart from the way they ground out a third successive Premier League victory. 
After a 10-day winter break, the Blues will have a chance to overturn the League Cup deficit when they return to action against Middlesbrough in the second leg on January 23. 
Palmer sent Bernd Leno the wrong way with his spot kick in the dying moments of the first half after Raheem Sterling was brought down by Issa Diop’s trailing foot. 
It was Palmer’s ninth league goal — two more than the Blues’ top scorer over the entirety of last season — since joining from Manchester City as a last-minute summer signing and quickly establishing himself as Chelsea’s most dangerous player. 
He was criticised for missing several chances in the defeat against Middlesbrough. 
“After the game I was disappointed like anyone would be missing that many chances,” Palmer told broadcaster TNT Sports. “You have those games and I’ve put it behind me and scored.” 
Fulham’s best chance for an equaliser fell to Raul Jimenez whose shot forced Djordje Petrovic into a one-handed save in the 73rd minute. Petrovic had also denied Harry Wilson in the first half as the visitors tried to catch their hosts on the break. 
Chelsea captain Conor Gallagher smacked the post with a shot from the outside of his boot in the 83rd minute but the final statistics showed the Blues had only three shots on target all game, a reminder of their woes in front of goal. 
The win pushed Chelsea up two places in the league table to eighth, above Manchester United and Newcastle United who both have a game in hand. 
Fulham, who have now lost five away games in the league in a row, remained 13th, eight points clear of the relegation zone. 
On Friday, Carlton Morris scored a controversial last-gasp goal as Luton Town escaped Turf Moor with a precious point against Burnley in a 1-1 draw between two sides fighting relegation.  
The hosts looked set for victory after Zeki Amdouni’s first-half goal before Morris headed in the equaliser in the 92nd minute. Burnley protested that Luton’s Elijah Adebayo impeded goalkeeper James Trafford, but following a VAR check, the goal stood.  
Burnley manager Vincent Kompany was perplexed by the call, telling TNT “I don’t get it anymore”.  
“There’s a clear attempt to stop the goalkeeper getting up,” he added. “It’s experience, it’s well done to try, it doesn’t take anything away from the performance for Luton, I thought they were incredible today, but it’s just the moment there the referees have got to get it right.”  
Rob Edwards’ Luton are 18th in the standings but level on 16 points with 17th-placed Everton. Burnley are 19th with 12 points, having played one game more than their opponents.  
“An away point in the Premier League is big, especially for a team in our position,” Edwards told TNT.  
The match was all Luton before Amdouni scored against the run of play in the 36th minute after Wilson Odobert beat his man with a step-over then played the ball across the box for Amdouni to fire home his fourth league goal of the season.  
The goal lifted Burnley and the game that marked the return of the Premier League after a 10-day break was evenly matched the rest of the way.  
Luton kept pressing and they were rewarded in debatable fashion when Morris nodded home from 10 yards after Adebayo’s block sent Trafford sprawling.

In their first career meeting, the 22-year-old outlasted the Belgian top seed over a gruelling 2 hours 48 minutes to write another chapter in her burgeoning career. 
This time last year, Navarro was ranked 149 but has since soared to a career-high 31, having also reached the semi-finals in Auckland this month. 
She is 8-1 this season heading into the Australian Open, where she will make her main draw debut against China’s Wang Xiyu as the 27th seed. 
“I don’t know if I could put words to the emotions, but it’s been a lot of years in the making,” Navarro said. “My coach and I have been together for eight years, I think. From where we started to now, it’s really crazy to think about. 
“Probably six, seven years ago, I was hoping to be a decent college player, and that was going to be good enough for me. So to be here now... I guess just a testament to the work we’ve both put in.”

“I suffered a bit with my Achilles tendon, so I’m trai­ning differently. I’m now on my way back but I don’t want to take any risks,” he told Norwegian media.
The 23-year-old will therefore not take part in the world indoor athletics championships in Glasgow in early March.
Ingebrigtsen had alre­ady skipped the European cross-country championships in mid-December, a competition that he has long dominated.
“I love competition, but sometimes you have to ma­ke tactical and boring cho­i­ces,” he explained. “For me, it’s the European and Olympic medals that count.”
The European championships take place in Rome in June before the Olympic Games in Paris in August.
A double world champion in the 5000m in 2022 and 2023, Ingebrigtsen has never won a world indoor title.

Kosovo captain Rrahmani capitalised on dreadful defending at a free-kick to poke home the winner and turn jeers into cheers at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. 
Walter Mazzarri’s side moved up to sixth in the standings on 31 points and Salernitana stay bottom on 12 points. 
Antonio Candreva scored a stunning goal to give Salernitana the lead in the 29th minute, curling his shot into the far top corner from well outside the area for his fifth goal this season. 
It looked like the visitors would take their lead into the break, but in added time Napoli were awarded a penalty converted by Matteo Politano, and Rrahmani pounced in the 96th minute to steal the win for the home side. 
Napoli are two points behind Fiorentina, who sit in the final Champions League spot and face Udinese on Sunday.

12,Musiala double hands Bayern win as club remembers Beckenbauer,MUNICH: Bayern Munich’s Jamal Musiala scored twice and Harry Kane added a late goal to give the champions a 3-0...,"MUNICH: Bayern Munich’s Jamal Musiala scored twice and Harry Kane added a late goal to give the champions a 3-0 victory over Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga restart on Friday as the club remembered Germany great Franz Beckenbauer who died last week. 
Beckenbauer, who spent the majority of his career at Bayern and helped establish them as a European powerhouse, died on Sunday at the age of 78. 
He was laid to rest just hours before kickoff, with Bayern honouring his memory with several tributes for the German football legend. 
Musiala, born two decades after Beckenbauer retired from the game in 1983, scored in each half to ensure the home side honoured his memory in the best possible fashion. 
Bundesliga top scorer Harry Kane was on target in stoppage time to take his league tally to 22 goals to equal Robert Lewandowski’s all-time league record for most goals at the halfway stage of a Bundesliga season. 
The Bavarians are in second place in the standings on 41 points, one behind leaders Bayer Leverkusen. 
“It was a great game. We had possession a lot and did good counter-pressing,” Musiala said. “We could have created more chances, we are all hungry. The most important thing is that we kept a clean sheet and got the three points.” 
The Germany international was assisted both times by Leroy Sane, who has set up 10 league this season. 
Before kick-off on Friday, players and 75,000 fans observed a minute’s silence in memory of Beckenbauer, one of only three men to have won the World Cup as a player and a coach. 
“It’s not easy to find the right words” an emotional Bayern veteran Thomas Mueller said, recognising that playing after the tributes was “a bit strange, of course.” 
“Not only people from the Bayern family, but everyone from around the planet acknowledged Franz Beckenbauer. He did everything for [Bayern] and we can only say thanks.” 
Bayern dominated possession early and their relentless pressure paid off in the 18th minute when Musiala threaded a shot in off the post from a tight angle. 
With new signing Eric Dier not yet in the squad, Bayern kept up the pressure and Musiala put the result beyond doubt with 20 minutes remaining, tapping in a Sane pass to double the lead. 
Hoffenheim were reduced to ten men shortly after when Grischa Proemel picked up a second yellow card and Kane’s left-footed shot in stoppage time sealing Bayern’s win.

13,Tabilo crowned surprise Auckland champion,AUCKLAND: Alejandro Tabilo will head into the Australian Open on a high after winning his first ATP Tour title with ...,"AUCKLAND: Alejandro Tabilo will head into the Australian Open on a high after winning his first ATP Tour title with a 6-2, 7-5 victory over Japan’s Taro Daniel in the Auckland Classic final on Saturday. 
The 26-year-old Chilean, who is ranked 82 in the world but is expected to break into the top 50 on the back of his triumph, said the title will deliver an injection of confidence after two years of pain and frustration. 
The 26-year-old’s only other final appearance came on clay at the Cordoba Open in 2022, before his career path took a downward spiral. 
“It honestly feels surreal right now. I’m so happy, very emotional, I never thought we were going to be here in the final,” he said. 
“Last year was tough, even two years ago we made the final of Cordoba and from there we were going up and we had a little almost stress fracture on my arm. 
“We had to stop that year and work back up. It’s been a lot of injuries... it’s been a crazy ride.”

14,Trophy and spectacle on the menu as Barca face Real in Super Cup final,RIYADH: The Real Madrid and Barcelona managers see the Spanish Super Cup final as an occasion that stands out both...,"RIYADH: The Real Madrid and Barcelona managers see the Spanish Super Cup final as an occasion that stands out both for the trophy on the line and the sporting spectacle it creates, as they prepare for Sunday’s match to be played in Riyadh for the second year. 
Super Cup’s second El Clasico final in a row will see the La Liga giants face off on foreign soil for the third time in a year, after Barcelona won last January’s final 3-1, also in Riyadh, and beat Real 3-0 in a friendly in the United States in July. 
“It’s always exciting to prepare for this type of match... it’s going to be a great spectacle,” Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti told reporters on Saturday. 
Though Real have had the upper hand in the rivalry this season, beating Barca 2-1 in October and building a seven-point lead at the top of the league, Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez said no one had an advantage going into the final. 
“I have the feeling that Real is stronger when Barca is stronger. Since I’ve been on the [Barcelona] bench, to win a title we’ve had to go above Madrid. It’s all very even,” he said. 
“We will try to dominate the game, impose our personality, our way of playing and dominate the ball... we have the example of last year and this is the ideal scenario to show it again.” 
While Xavi drew inspiration from last year’s final, Ancelotti played down its relevance. 
“Real Madrid don’t go out for revenge, they go out to the limit because that’s the requirement of this shirt and this club,” he said. 
“We’re one step away from the first trophy of the season. We’re going to try to do what we have to do, which is to try to win the final.” 
Officials for the final, referee Juan Martinez Munuera and his VAR colleague Cesar Soto Grado, meanwhile, said they are fed up of the Barcelona refereeing scandal under investigation, and the impact the case is having on their lives and profession. 
Last year the Catalan club and several of their former directors were charged with bribery by a Spanish judge after alleged payments to former Spanish refereeing vice-president Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira. 
“This topic is starting to boil my blood, I am very tired of the ‘Negreira case’,” said Soto Grado at a news conference in Riyadh. “Just because there is one corrupt person in a company, it does not mean everyone else has to be as well.” 
Negreira allegedly earned over seven million euros ($7.5 million) from Barcelona between 2001 and 2018, through companies supposedly producing refereeing reports, according to the club. 
In recent days Spanish media outlets have reported on referees testifying before Spanish police as part of the investigation into the payments made by Barcelona. 
Martinez Munuera said that the Negreira case is affecting him in his daily life. “You go to the supermarket, you’re with your wife and your son, and there are people who call you corrupt,” he said.
