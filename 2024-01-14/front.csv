0,Does PTI’s exit mean walkover for PML-N in polls?,"With no real rival left, party finalises election rallies’ schedule","As the political atmosphere in the country by and large remains nonchalant seemingly because of the PTI’s exit from the political arena, it has practically become unnecessary for its rival the PML-N to launch its election campaign.
However, the PML-N has finalised its schedule for nationwide election rallies, which will start from Jan 15 and continue till Feb 6, The Express Tribune has learnt.
The PML-N seems to have received a walkover in the upcoming elections as it is the only party with any chances of giving the others a run for their money.
The Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) has already entered into a seat adjustment with the PML-N while the other players in Punjab, which include the PPP, were too insignificant to make any impact on the outcome.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has encamped in Punjab to cash in on the PTI’s misfortune, but the chances of the party making any impact in the province are very slim.
Talking to The Express Tribune, PML-N Central Information Secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb said her party would launch its election campaign on Jan 15 with a rally in Okara.
She added that the rally in Okara would be led by PML-N Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz. It would be followed by a rally in Hafizabad led by PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif.

On Jan 17, party President Shehbaz Sharif will lead a rally in Multan followed by another one in Mandi Bahauddin on Jan 19. These rallies will continue till Feb 6.
Speaking on the Supreme Court’s verdict that deprived the PTI of its cherished electoral symbol of the ‘cricket bat’, Marriyum maintained that the party itself was responsible for this decision as they did not conduct internal polls as per the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) code of conduct.
She claimed that the PTI had only its former chairman Imran Khan to blame for its woes as he had become addicted to overriding the electoral machinery for favourable outcomes similar to what he did during the 2018 general polls when the Results Transmission System (RTS) was shut down.
The PML-N leader said if any other party had carried out the same act, its consequences would have been no different.
When asked about the perception that the PML-N had sought assurance from the ‘powerful circles’ of ensuring the ouster of the PTI from the political arena, she replied that her party had no part to play in this decision.
“We didn’t ask the PTI not to conduct its (intra-party) elections in such a manner,” she added.
To a query as to how can a party, which was not allowed to even exist by the ‘powerful circles’ and whose activists were scared of showing their affiliation with it fearing for their lives and properties, conduct its internal elections in a way defined by the ECP, the former federal information minister said it was not about victimisation or a level-playing field, but actually about not following the procedure.
To a question, she maintained that the PML-N had nothing to fear and there was no truth behind the perception that it was scared of facing the PTI in the field because of its so-called rising popularity.
To another query about the PML-Q’s reservations with the PML-N for not offering it enough seats, Marriyum said the party was its ally and it respected it for its support during the previous coalition government.
She continued that the PML-N would address the PML-Q’s concerns. “A committee formed to chalk out a seat adjustment formula is looking into the matter,” she added.

1,Bilawal hails return of two-party system,"Fires a broadside at PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif for failing people of Sindh, Balochistan","PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has claimed that after “exclusion” of the PTI, the election contest is now between traditional political rivals—the PPP and the PML-N.
“Now that there is no Bat, the contest will be between the Arrow and the Lion,” Bilawal said while addressing a large public meeting at Mumtaz ground in Sindh’s Khairpur district on Sunday evening.
Traditionally, the PTI has used the election symbol 'Bat,' while the PPP and the PML-N have used 'Arrow' and 'Lion' respectively.
Bilawal was referring to a verdict of the Supreme Court which on Saturday deprived the PTI of its iconic election symbol while hearing a petition of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).

The SC order came as a major blow to the former ruling party which now cannot nominate its candidates for reserved seats while its candidates for general seats will now have to contest polls as independents.
During the speech, the PPP chief targeted PML-N supreme leader and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, claiming that the people of Sindh do not want to see him installed as the country's prime minister for the fourth time.
He claimed that Sindh's people have bad memories about Sharif when he was elected as the PM for the first, second and third times. ""Why should we accept him as the PM for a fourth time? We will fight and we will hunt the lion,"" he said,

He asked the party's workers and supporters to knock every single door in their towns and villages and to brief the people about the PPP’s 10-point charter of economy.
Bilawal vowed to bury the politics of revenge, hatred and divide once and for all if his party won a majority mandate in the country and formed the federal government. He reiterated that the PPP's foes are poverty, unemployment and inflation.
He argued that the other political parties neither have public oriented manifestos nor ideology. They do not even feel what hardships the people of Pakistan confront every day.
The PPP's leader cautioned that the PML-N wanted to roll back the 18th constitutional amendment and the National Finance Commission (NFC) award because the party believed that those landmark accomplishments have shrunken the federal coffers. ""I say that funds were there but you stole them and the bureaucracy in Islamabad has occupied the resources.""
He reassured the people that Rs300 billion being squandered on allegedly useless federal ministries and Rs1,500 billion being given under the garb of subsidies to the country's elite will be shelved. He added that all those funds will be directly channeled towards welfare of the peasants, laborers and youth.

The PPP's chairman once again drew a comparison between the public healthcare facilities in Sindh and Punjab, claiming that during his recent visit to Lahore he could not find any facility matching the services of Khairpur’s Gambat Institute of Medical Sciences.
He also compared former PM Imran Khan's promise of constructing five million homes for the poor people with the PPP's Sindh government's initiative of building two million houses for the people hit by floods in 2022.
He said the former plan existed only in slogans while the PPP's provincial government was able to materialize commencement of the latter in a short span of one year.
He promised that not only those two million houses will be built, but three million more houses for the poor people will also be constructed across the country if the PPP formed the central government.
Bilawal complained that the caretaker Sindh government has slowed down construction of homes and also the process of transferring ownership rights to the beneficiaries of such homes.
He protested that the development works initiated by the PPP's Sindh government have been stopped but the same works are continuing in Punjab.
""I want to tell every single officer who has snatched the right to own a house from the flood hit people and every single officer who kept making excuses to deny them ownership that I will personally hold them accountable,"" he warned.

2,SC ruling puts poll credibility at stake,Legal experts say 'unfortunate decision' would rob voters of their right to choose,"The Supreme Court’s directive to withdraw the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) election symbol, despite ensuring the scheduling of general elections on Feb 8, has set off ripples of concern about the credibility of the upcoming electoral process, raising questions about its impact on democratic principles.
In a striking blow to the former ruling party, the apex court's decision would force PTI's ticket holders to navigate the electoral battleground as independent candidates, altering the political landscape significantly.
Commenting on the judgement, former Sindh High Court Bar Association president Salahuddin Ahmed expressed disappointment, labelling it as ""an unfortunate decision"" with potential repercussions on the elections' credibility.
Ahmed, while acknowledging issues with PTI's intra-party elections, pointed out that depriving a party of its electoral symbol should be reserved for exceptional circumstances. He argued that such penalties, especially in a low-literacy country, may infringe upon voters' right to choose.
""While there were certainly problems with PTI’s intra-party elections, the decision to deprive a party of its electoral symbol is a penalty that should be reserved for the rarest of cases because in a low-literacy country, it robs voters of their right to choose.""
Questioning the fate of Section 215 of the Election Act, Ahmed pondered whether it would become the new Article 62 (1) (f) and be wielded by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) or the judiciary as a tool for ""cleansing the body politic.""

Faisal Siddiqi advocate said that ruling in PTI’s ‘bat’ case will join the ranks of the notorious 'Maulvi Tamizuddin case' as a decision which by hiding behind the smokescreen of legal technicalities has fatally damaged democratic constitutionalism.
""Today, history will ask: Is the political engineering of 2018, any different from the one in 2023-24,” he added.
Barrister Asad Raheem also weighed in, saying that an order with no bearing in the law, or for that matter the SC’s direct responsibility to preserve and protect the Constitution. Raheem labelled the reasoning behind the decision as “absurd”, leading to a “ludicrous outcome”.
Ex-additional attorney general Tariq Mahmood Khokhar pointed out that “an unelected and unaccountable, self-appointed and self-perpetuated institution disenfranchises the nation”.
Interestingly, the SC order did not provide an interpretation of Article 17 of the Constitution, and the judgment in the Benazir Bhutto case was not considered in the decision.
Meanwhile, the order has further fuelled perceptions among PTI supporters that Justice Isa is biased toward the party leadership. There is no doubt that SC order found several irregularities in PTI’s intra-party elections.
Concerns have been raised regarding whether the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) applied the same level of scrutiny to intra-party elections of other political parties.
It is argued that the apex court should have taken into account the challenges faced by PTI since the incidents of May 9. Former CJ Saqib Nisar withdrew the PML-N election symbol during Senate elections, and a similar action was taken by CJP Isa concerning PTI.
The Supreme Court should have considered the circumstances which are being faced by the PTI since May 9 incidents. Ex CJP Saqib Nisar had withdrawn the PML-N elections symbol in Senate elections while CJP Isa did the same with the PTI.
It is pertinent to note that ex-CJP Nisar continues to face accusations of playing a key role to implementing plan orchestrated by powerful circles against PML-N before the 2018 general elections.
Meanwhile, history will ultimately assess the role of Justice Isa in the 2024 elections, as the PTI raises concerns about a lack of a level playing field. In the absence of election credibility, holding them on February 8 may be rendered unnecessary.
