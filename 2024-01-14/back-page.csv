• UN official says Israel’s ‘inhumanity beyond comprehension’ 
GAZA CITY: Israeli strikes killed 60 people in Gaza Strip on Saturday amid a telecommunications blackout in the besieged territory on the 99th day since the Oct 7 Hamas raid.
Fears of the conflict widening intensified after US and British forces struck pro-Hamas Houthi rebels in Yemen following attacks on Red Sea shipping, with the US military announcing a fresh air strike on Saturday.
Witnesses reported Israeli bombardment in the early morning and that intense shelling hit the Palestinian territory’s south on Friday night.
“I was visiting my sister, and when I returned I found my house was bombed,” said 60-year-old Samir Qashta, a resident of Rafah in southern Gaza, where many people have fled.
“Is my house hurting Israel in any way?”
Israel’s relentless bombardment of Gaza since the Oct 7 raid has killed 23,843 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to an updated toll on Saturday.
At Rafah’s Al Najjar hospital, mourners gathered and prayed around the bodies of slain relatives. One man held the body of a child, wrapped in white cloth, ahead of burial.
Internet and telecommunications services were cut on Friday as a result of Israeli bombardment, the main operator Paltel said, reporting the latest such disruption.
The Palestinian Red Crescent posted that the outage was increasing the challenges in “reaching the wounded and injured promptly”.
Winter rains have exacerbated the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the UN estimates 1.9 million people — nearly 85 percent of the population — have been displaced. Many have sought shelter in Rafah and other southern areas.
“It was a harsh and difficult night,” said Nabila Abu Zayed, 40, who now lives in a tent at Al Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis.
“The rain flooded our tent... We spent the night standing with hundreds of displaced people like us in the corridors of the maternity ward,” she said.
“It was very cold and we had no winter clothes or blankets. All of my children are sick.”
“There was bombing through the night,” said Abu Zayed. “Where will we go?”
`Inhumanity beyond comprehension’
The United Nations humanitarian office, OCHA, said that Israel was blocking aid convoys into northern Gaza.
“They have been very systematic in not allowing us to support hospitals,” said OCHA’s head for the Palestinian territories, Andrea De Domenico, decrying “a level of inhumanity beyond comprehension.”
In central Gaza, a lack of fuel forced the shutdown of the main generator of Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el Balah, the health ministry said.
Health ministry spokesman Qudra accused Israel of “deliberately targeting hospitals... to put them out of service”, warning of “devastating repercussions”.
Hospitals, protected under international humanitarian law, have repeatedly been hit by Israeli strikes in Gaza.
Fewer than half of Gaza’s hospitals are partly functioning, according to the World Health Organisation.
Concern for prisoners
In Israel, concern grew for prisoners held in Gaza as they approach their 100th day in captivity.
Palestinian militants on October 7 seized about 250 hostages, 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza, including at least 25 believed to have been killed.
On Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said a deal had been negotiated with Qatar to get medicine to the captives.
Israeli campaign group Hostages and Missing Families Forum released a report this week saying the captives were in poor health, some with complex illnesses, others with injuries.
A diplomat familiar with the negotiations said both sides had expressed a willingness to allow the delivery of medicines, and a source close to Hamas said talks were ongoing.
Israel criticised the UN human rights office for not reiterating its calls for the release of prisoners in a statement marking the looming 100th day of the conflict.
“A call for a ceasefire, without demanding the release of our hostages and the disarming of Hamas, is a call for terrorism to win,” its mission in Geneva said.
‘Life should go on’
The relentless Israeli bombing didn’t stop Gaza couple Afnan Jibril and Mustafa Shamlakh from getting married in Rafah.
“The house where the groom was supposed to live was destroyed,” Ayman Shamlakh, the groom’s uncle, said.
“We are all living through the same tragedy. However, we must continue to live, and life should go on.”
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where violence has surged since October, Israeli troops killed three Palestinians after accusing them of attacking a Jewish settlement.
Palestinian news agency Wafa identified the three killed as a 19-year-old and two 16-year-olds.

1,Scientists assert ‘alien mummies’ in Peru are really dolls made from Earthly bones,"“It’s totally a made-up story,” says archaeologist Flavio Estrada.","LIMA: A pair of ‘alien mummies’ that mysteriously turned up at the airport in Peru’s capital last October have entirely Earthly origins, according to a scientific analysis revealed on Friday.
The two small specimens were described as humanoid dolls by experts at a press conference in Lima, and likely fashioned from both human and animal parts. A separate three-fingered hand believed to be from Peru’s Nazca region was also analysed, with experts ruling out any connection to alien life.
“They’re not extraterrestrials. They’re dolls made from animal bones from this planet joined together with modern synthetic glue,” said Flavio Estrada, an archeologist with Peru’s Institute for Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences.
“It’s totally a made-up story,” Estrada added.
The two figurines turned up in the Lima airport offices of courier DHL in a cardboard box, and were made to look like mummified bodies dressed in traditional Andean attire. Some media outlets subsequently speculated about possible alien origin.
Last September, two tiny mummified bodies with elongated heads and hands with three fingers were featured at a Mexican congressional hearing, generating widespread media coverage. Mexican journalist and UFO enthusiast Jaime Maussan claimed those bodies were about 1,000 years old and recovered from Peru in 2017, but not related to any known species.
Most experts later dismissed them as a fraud, possibly mutilated ancient human mummies combined with animal parts, but certainly from Earth.
At the Lima press conference on Friday, which was organised by Peru’s culture ministry, experts did not say that the dolls found in the DHL office were related to the bodies presented in Mexico, and they stressed that the remains in Mexico are also not extraterrestrial.

2,India protests UK diplomat’s visit to Azad Kashmir,Says British High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott's visit infringed on India's “sovereignty and territorial integrity”.,"MUMBAI: India said on Saturday it had lodged a protest over a senior British diplomat’s visit to Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), saying the trip this week had infringed on India’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
British High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott visited AJK, along with an official from the UK Foreign Office, on Jan 10, India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.
India’s Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra has lodged a “strong protest” to the British High Commissioner to India about the visit, the ministry said, calling the trip “unacceptable”.
Asked to comment on the Indian protest, a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office confirmed Marriott’s visit and added: “She met the UK-Pakistani diaspora, played in a football match with street children and visited a bakery.”

FM Jaishankar to visit Iran to discuss bilateral, regional and global issues

Iran visit
India’s foreign minister will make a two-day trip to Iran from Sunday, following Western air strikes against Yemen’s Houthi fighters over the group’s attacks on vessels in the Red Sea.
S. Jaishankar’s visit also comes a month after a drone attack on a ship near Indian waters that the United States blamed on Iran.
A government statement issued on Saturday said that Jaishankar would meet his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian to discuss “bilateral, regional and global issues”, without giving further detail.
The Houthis have carried out scores of drone and missile strikes on the key international route through the Red Sea since the start of Israel’s war in Gaza on October 7.
Many vessels have been rerouted from the Red Sea due to drone and missile attacks carried out by the Houthis in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.
India has significantly stepped up its own maritime patrols in the Arabian Sea to “maintain a deterrent presence” after the string of attacks on vessels.
In December a drone attack hit the MV Chem Pluto oil tanker 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres) off the coast of India, which the United States blamed on Iran — claims Tehran dubbed “worthless”.
Earlier this month, India’s navy said it had rescued 21 crew members from a vessel in the Arabian Sea after a hijacking distress call.
Jaishankar said on Thursday he had spoken to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken about “maritime security challenges, especially (in) the Red Sea region”.

3,Intense blizzard blows Iowa caucus campaigning off course,"The storm will be followed by an “Arctic outbreak” of “bitter cold”, according to the NWS.","DES MOINES: Plunging temperatures, whipping wind and buckets of snow derailed the final stretch of caucus campaigning in the US state of Iowa on Friday as Republican presidential hopefuls delivered their last pitches to voters.
Forecasters warned of “fairly intense blizzard conditions” throughout much of the mid-western state, as the National Weather Service (NWS) said gusts of 80 to 89 kilometres per hour, paired with blowing snow, could reduce visibility down to 500 metres.
The extreme weather was making life difficult for White House hopefuls Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, who both cancelled events just days before Monday’s caucus in Iowa — the first vote of this year’s White House race.
“We want everyone to be safe,” DeSantis told reporters in the state capital Des Moines.
The wind was howling very strongly in the city, where the temperature had fallen to -14 Celsius.
The storm will be followed by an “Arctic outbreak” of “bitter cold”, according to the NWS, which warned of “dangerously cold wind chill” falling as low as -43 Celsius in Iowa and across the region over the weekend.
Another two or more inches of snow was also predicted for the state, for a total of up to 10 inches in some areas, creating whiteout conditions.
Dozens of cars and trucks were seen overturned in Des Moines, and the Iowa state patrol said on social media they had performed 436 “motorist assists” on Friday.
The weather raised serious concerns over caucus turnout as Haley and DeSantis seek to overtake former president Donald Trump, who is leading polls for the Republican presidential nomination by a wide margin nationally and in Iowa.
“We’re going to get people to the polls on caucus night” regardless of the weather, the state’s Republican Governor Kim Reynolds promised.
Former UN ambassador and South Carolina governor Haley moved all of Friday’s events online, even as she had implored Iowans to not let the weather stop them from showing up on Monday.
“I’ll brave anything we need to,” DeSantis told reporters standing outside in the snow.
“We want to win, we’re here to get every vote we can,” said the 45-year-old hoping to face President Joe Biden in the general election later this year. But Trump, who pledged to his supporters that he’d make it to Iowa ahead of the vote despite the weather, is counting on a resounding win in the state to help him quickly bag the nomination as his four criminal indictments loom.

4,"Turkiye ‘neutralises’ 45 Kurdish rebels in Iraq, Syria","“Operations following the treacherous attack neutralised a total of 45 terrorists, 36 in northern Iraq and 9 in northern Syria,” Ankara says.","ANKARA: Turkiye said on Saturday its forces had ‘neutralised’ 45 Kurdish militants in northern Syria and Iraq following a clash on Friday with members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in which nine Turkish soldiers were killed in northern Iraq.
“Operations following the treacherous attack neutralised a total of 45 terrorists, 36 in northern Iraq and 9 in northern Syria,” Turkiye’s Communications Directorate said in a statement after President Tayyip Erdogan chaired a security meeting.
Ankara typically uses the term “neutralised” to mean killed.
“Turkiye will never allow the establishment of a ‘terrorland’ on its southern borders under any pretext and for any reason,” the statement in Turkish added.
Earlier on Saturday, the Defence Ministry said the military had carried out airstrikes in the Hakurk, Metina, Gara and Qandil regions of northern Iraq, destroying 29 PKK targets included caves, bunkers, shelters and oil facilities.
Turkish forces have been carrying out a cross-border operation called “Claw-Lock” in Iraq as part of the country’s offensive against PKK militants.
Turkiye has also launched military incursions in Syria against the Kurdish YPG militia, regarding it as a wing of the PKK.
The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkiye, the United States and the European Union, took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984.

5,Taiwan voters hand ruling party third presidential term,"Lai stresses cooperation and dialogue with Beijing on ""equal basis""; China vows not to give up on achieving ‘reunification’ of territory.","

• Lai stresses cooperation and dialogue with Beijing on ‘equal basis’
• China vows not to give up on achieving ‘reunification’ of the territory
• Biden says US does not support independence of Taiwan
• Russia insists it continues to view the island as an integral part of China
TAIPEI: Taiwanese voters swept the ruling Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) presidential candidate Lai Ching-te into power on Saturday, while China said it would not give up on achieving “reunification”.
Lai’s party, which champions Taiwan’s separate identity, was seeking a third successive four-year term, unprecedented under Taiwan’s current electoral system. He emphasised the need for cooperation and dialogue with Beijing on an ‘equal basis’.
However, in a measure of public frustration at domestic issues like the high cost of housing and stagnating wages after eight years in power, the DPP lost its majority in parliament, making Lai’s job harder in passing legislation.
Lai won only 40 per cent of the vote in Taiwan’s first-past-the-post system, unlike current President Tsai Ing-wen who was re-elected by a landslide four years ago with more than 50pc of the vote.
China’s Taiwan Affairs Office struck a gentler tone in its response to Lai’s election and did not mention him by name, saying that the results reveal the DPP “cannot represent the mainstream public opinion” on Taiwan.
“Our stance on resolving the Taiwan question and realising national reunification remains consistent, and our determination is as firm as a rock,” it said.
However, it added, China will work with “relevant political parties, groups and people” from Taiwan to boost exchanges and cooperation, and “advance the peaceful development of cross-strait relations as well as the cause of national reunification”.
China believes in One China policy and rejects Taiwan elections. Beijing has framed the elections as a choice between “peace and war”, calling the DPP dangerous separatists and urging Taiwanese to make the “right choice”.
China’s defence ministry, responding to a question on Friday on Taiwan’s air force upgrading F-16 fighter jets and buying more from the United States, said even with purchases of US weapons the DPP “cannot stop the trend of complete reunification of the motherland”.
“The Chinese People’s Liberation Army remains on high alert at all times and will take all necessary measures to resolutely crush any form of ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist plots and firmly defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” said ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang.
The United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Japan congratulated Lai on winning the presidential election.
President Joe Biden said the United States does not support the independence of Taiwan. “We do not support independence...” Biden said, when asked for reaction to Saturday’s elections.
Russian foreign ministry’s spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, commenting after the vote, said Moscow continued to view Taiwan as an integral part of China.
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said he hoped Taiwan and China would renew efforts to resolve their differences peacefully. “I hope that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will renew efforts to resolve differences peacefully through constructive dialogue, without the threat or use of force or coercion,” he said in a statement.
There were jubilant scenes among a sea of cheering supporters outside Lai’s campaign headquarters.
Domestic challenges
Lai admitted that after losing its parliamentary majority, the DPP had “many areas that need improvement”. However, he offered an olive branch to his opponents in saying he would include talent from their parties.
Lai said he would cooperate with his electoral rivals, Hou Yu-ih of Taiwan’s largest opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), and former Taipei mayor Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan Peoples Party (TPP), in resolving the problems Taiwan faces.
Taiwan’s media reported the DPP won 51 seats to the KMT’s 52, while the TPP got eight.
Ko appeared open to working with Lai. “The TPP will play the role of a critical minority, without fixing who we collaborate with,” Ko told reporters after conceding.
