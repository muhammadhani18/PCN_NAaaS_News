0,PHC moved to change mode of filling minority seats in assemblies,Petitioners want representatives of non-Muslims elected directly,"PESHAWAR: Two members of a religious minority on Saturday moved Peshawar High Court, challenging the constitutional provisions of reserved seats for non-Muslims and requesting for issuance of directives for holding direct elections on their seats for National and provincial assemblies.
The two members of Christian community, Rameez Alam and Anil Maseeh, through a joint petition requested the high court to declare as undemocratic and unconstitutional the provisions of Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010, through which changes were made in Constitution and mechanism for filling the reserved seats for non-Muslims was changed.
They requested the court to declare that the said mode of filling reserved seats was violative of fundamental rights and not in line with the preamble of Constitution. The petitioners also prayed the court to restore the pre-amendments Article 51(6) and 106 (3) of Constitution.
The petition filed through Advocate Nouman Muhib Kakakhel includes the federal secretaries of cabinet and law divisions as respondents.

Petitioners want representatives of non-Muslims elected directly

The petitioners stated that after amendments in Article 51 and 106, the members of minority communities on the seats reserved for non-Muslims were elected on basis of proportional representation system instead of being directly elected by the minorities. They said that earlier religious minorities had the power to vote and elect their representative and offer themselves for elections.
However, they said, due to the impugned amendments it was changed to an undemocratic system wherein neither the minorities could offer themselves to contest elections, nor vote for their representatives hence the elected people were not true representatives of the community.
“The preamble of Constitution provides for safeguarding of legitimate interests of minorities and this amendment is violative of the preamble of Constitution hence liable to be struck down to this extent,” they contended.
They said that the present provisions were in violation of the Objective Resolution, which was now part of Constitution to safeguarded the rights of minorities.
The petitioners contended that after the said amendments, true representatives of the community were not being empowered to represent rather leaders were imposed on them by Muslim majority political parties.
They claimed that the persons mentioned by political parties in their priority lists of candidates on minority seats in legislative assembly had no connection with the public and even refused to meet them citing reasons of not being elected though their votes which was against the principles of democracy and responsible representation.
They said that the undemocratic setup for the minority communities left them voiceless as people alien to them were selected by political parties. They added that the persons elected on reserved seats worked on the command of their respective parties instead of looking after the interests of minorities.

Speaking at a gathering of party workers in Sherpao village here, he opposed postponing the elections on the pretext of deteriorating law and order and harsh weather, adding that this would further complicate the situation. He maintained that elections were the only way to bring political and economic stability to the country.
Aftab Sherpao said the political parties should join hands to help steer the country out of the prevailing crises. He said after the polls, the political parties should work together to revive the economy and improve the worsening law and order.
He urged the people to use their right to vote in order to send their representatives to the assemblies so that they could work for the uplift of their areas. “We will spare no effort to serve the people,” he vowed.
He said his party had always served the people as it believed in working for the development of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
Aftab Sherpao said the voters must not fall for catchy slogans and empty pledges as opportunists were once again out to deceive them. He advised the voters to check the track record of the candidates before voting for them.
He said that nobody cared to raise voice for the rights of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa facing financial crunch. He said all uplift projects in KP were placed on the backburner.
The QWP leader said the PTI ruled KP for almost a decade, but left the province in dire financial straits. He said the province was buried under huge loans. He said that experiments with the political system caused colossal loss to the economy, therefore, such practices should be stopped.

Munawar Khan made the confession before the local police and judicial magistrate.
He had killed his wife in Dec 1997 over a domestic dispute, according to police.
Head of the Chakisar police station Fazal Elahi told Dawn that he learned about the 22-year-old woman’s murder on Jan 5 leading to the start of an inquiry and the detention of her father, Munawar Khan.
He added that during interrogation, the detainee confessed to committing the murder in his jeep outside their house and burying the body in their ancestral graveyard.
The SHO said the accused insisted that his daughter left the house a year after her marriage to her cousin and that she had an extramarital affair with a man, who currently lived abroad.
He said he asked his daughter to return to her husband’s house but she wanted to divorce her husband to marry another man.
Mr Elahi said the accused recorded the same statement in the court of judicial magistrate Yousaf Shah leading to the registration of an FIR under the Pakistan Penal Code’s sections 302, 311, 201 and 202 and the start of investigation.
He also said the accused was booked in Dec 1997 for pushing his wife into a river in the Ranyal area but was released from the jail 20 days later due to a patch-up with the deceased’s family.
POLL TICKET: The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl’s Puran tehsil chapter has demanded of the leadership to review its decision about election nomination.
The demand was made during a meeting attended by local party leaders Dr Abid Khan, Haji Zahid and many others.
The participants said they had been loyal to the party for decades but its election ticket was awarded to a new entrant.
Mr Zahid claimed that the district and tehsil emirs weren’t taken on board about the award of the ticket and seat adjustment with the PML-N in the area.
He warned the party’s local leadership won’t support that candidate if its reservations weren’t addressed.

8,Growers reject tobacco price fixed for current year,"SWABI: Growers have rejected the Rs505 per kilogramme tobacco purchasing price fixed for the current year, and...","SWABI: Growers have rejected the Rs505 per kilogramme tobacco purchasing price fixed for the current year, and announced to launch a protest movement against the federal ministry of commerce over its decision.
They made the decision during a meeting held at Mathra Park in Dagi here on Saturday. 
The participants declared that the purchasing companies had deceived the farmers as they had failed to fulfill the pledges on several occasions. They also blasted the Pakistan Tobacco Board for its ‘controversial’ role in determining tobacco price, and ‘always toeing the company’s line’.
A large number of farmers from across the district participated in the protest meeting. 
The participants vowed to continue their struggle from a joint platform, resisting the ‘tactics’ used by the companies to earn billions of rupees at the cost of poor growers.
Ittehad Kashtkaran chairman Arif Ali Khan, central president of Tobacco Growers Association Pakistan Liaqat Yousafzai, Faridullah Kaka, a leader of Kashtkar Coordination Council, and others spoke on the occasion.
The growers’ leaders demanded that the per kg tobacco rate should be fixed in proportion to the prevailing record inflation and the high expenditures incurred on production of the crop.
On the occasion, Arif Ali recalled that the companies bought tobacco from growers at Rs425 per kg at initial stage in the 2023 season, but the market price later jumped to Rs1,200 per kg. He said the firms promised to pay the arrears at the end of the season as per the final rate, but to no avail.
Liaqat Yousafzai said different growers’ associations had jointly started a campaign, collecting vouchers of the low purchase price from farmers, who had agreements with the companies.
In the second phase, he said a sit-in would be staged outside the gates of the tobacco purchase centres in the production areas.
The growers’ leaders said in case of the companies’ failure to meet the demands, a campaign would be launched, asking farmers to switch to other crops.

10,Authorities await funds to resume free treatment of people,Health dept has submitted new Sehat Card PC-I to AIP,"PESHAWAR: Authorities have pinned hopes on approval of a new PC-I for release of funds from Accelerated Implementation Programme to continue free medication of people on Sehat Card Plus (SCP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and newly-merged districts.
In October last year, State Life Insurance Corporation (SLIC) restricted free health scheme to only emergency patients due to lack of funding by the government. Prior to this, the scheme covered the entire population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
SLIC, the implementer of SCP in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has been facing financial issues as the caretaker government has not been releasing its outstanding amount. The insurer wants the government to release its Rs20 unpaid amount in lieu of treatment of people under the programme. Owing to non-payment of the amount, it has been stopping and resuming health services and of late free treatment was restricted to only cancer, dialysis and emergency patients that drastically reduced the number of patients availing cashless services.
The number of beneficiaries of SCP, which used to be 120,000 per month, continues to dip after limiting services to emergency patients only. In October 2023, the number of people receiving free health services was recorded 21,000. It was reduced to 20,000 in November and December each while per month expenses remained about Rs280 million per month.

Health dept has submitted new Sehat Card PC-I to AIP

This situation prompted the health department to seek funds from Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP) to continue full-fledged free treatment services. A PC-I was submitted to PDWP, seeking Rs9 billion for SCP but it wasn’t discussed in the last meeting held a week ago. It is likely to be on the agenda in the next meeting. Authorities are hopeful that the PC-I will be approved and the department is likely to get the required funds.
Sources said that AIP was meant to provide funds to tribal districts after their merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Last year, the province spent Rs4.5 billion on the treatment of residents of tribal districts and a similar amount was required for the current year. If the department received Rs4.5 billion from AIP that would be given to SLIC to continue the programme for covering the entire population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including the dwellers of the tribal districts.
Sources said that it had been agreed during the previous PTI government in Islamabad that the centre-run Sehat Sahulat Programme would provide free treatment services to the residents of tribal districts till June 2023 and after that they would be covered under SCP of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, the residents of tribal districts were shifted to SCP in June 2022 but liabilities weren’t shifted as had been agreed in a meeting held with former prime minister Imran Khan in the chair.
Therefore, the SCP should get the amount from AIP for 2022-23 and 2023-24 financial years, they said.
Sources said that funds were available in AIP and if the PC-I was approved then SCP would get Rs9 billion that would pave the way for resumption of the programme, covering the whole population of the province. But in case of non-approval of PC-I or lack of funds with AIP, the programme would suffer further, they added.
Since limiting the programme to emergency patients, the people have been availing free health services services only in divisional headquarters where cancer and dialysis services are available.
Sources said that SLIC, which was required to make payments to empanelled hospitals on monthly basis, would resume services even if it got Rs4 billion in one go but it received only Rs4 billion during the last six months, making it difficult for the former to pay to the hospitals.

14,"Arrest warrants issued for PTI leader, nephew",Order issued by Mansehra DC says Babar Saleem Swati not paying heed to repeated warnings.,"MANSEHRA: Mansehra deputy commissioner Bilal Shahid Rao on Saturday issued arrest warrants for former adviser to chief minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Babar Saleem Swati and his nephew for disturbing law and order.
“Mr Swati should be arrested and confined at the central prison in Haripur as he has not been paying heed to repeated warnings to refrain from indulging in activities, which create law and order in the district,” an order issued by Mr Rao said.
It further said that actions of Mr Swati had disturbed the peaceful environment in the district.
“Mr Swati has been posing a grave threat to peaceful environment as he is instigating the public to come out onto the streets to challenge the writ of the government,” the order said. The DC’s order said arrest warrants for Mr Swati were also issued earlier at the demand of the district police officer, but he didn’t mend his ways and was still involved in activities vitiating the peaceful environment.
The DC further said Mr Swati should immediately be arrested under section 3(1) of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance.
Meanwhile, the deputy commissioner also issued arrest warrants for PTI leader Kamal Saleem Swati, the nephew of Babar Saleem Swati, for disturbing the peace in the district.

15,"Women candidates highlight rights issues in Kohistan, Torghar campaign",Insist it is a challenge for them to canvass in conservative region,"MANSEHRA: Women standing in the Feb 9 general elections in Kohistan and Torghar districts have promised to fight for the rights of women and children after becoming assembly members.
They are contesting elections for general seats of assemblies for the first time in the history of the region, where women have limited access to formal education and have a very low literacy rate.
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf activist Tehmina Faheem, an election candidate in Kohistan’s PK-31 constituency, complains that male election contestants never raised voice against child marriages and gender-based violence in their campaigns and therefore, those issues continued to prevail in the region.
“It is a big change itself that I, as a woman, am running for a general seat in the area as we [women] were always kept away from the electoral process and our right to vote was exercised through community alliances and in line with jirga decrees,” she told Dawn.

Insist it is a challenge for them to canvass in conservative region

Ms Faheem said since she was part of a patriarchal society, it was an uphill task for her to canvass for herself.
She, however, said she won’t lose hope and would continue soliciting votes.
The candidate said child marriages were rampant in Kohistan and Torghar areas due to the poor implementation of the Child Marriage Restrain Act, 1929.
“After election, we will legislate to do away with excesses against girls and boys through child marriages,” she said, adding that minors didn’t understand their roles and responsibilities as married couples.
She also said as an assembly member, she would also strive to address women’s issues.
Shakila Rabbani, a PTI candidate for PK-41 in Torghar district, said it was a big challenge for her to contest elections in a constituency, where the jirga system was deeply rooted.
“I’m highlighting the issues of child marriages and women’s rights in the election campaign – a first in the history of this erstwhile tribal belt,” she said.
Nilofar Bukhtiar, the chairperson of the National Commission on Status of Women, told Dawn that women would continue to suffer until they didn’t become part of the electoral exercise by contesting for general seats of assemblies.
“Child marriages are widespread in our country. We can address this core child rights issue only by prioritising it,” she told Dawn.
Ms Bukhtiar said the NCSW, in collaboration with the Unicef, United Nations Women and UNFPA, was working on a national programme against child marriages and for women’s effective representation in national institutions.
NOMINATION WITHDRAWAL: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-Parliamentarians central president Saleh Mohammad Khan has withdrawn his nomination papers for contesting election in NA-14 Mansehra.
Now, he will face Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz supremo Nawaz Sharif in the district’s NA-15 and PK-40 constituencies.
Meanwhile, PML-N divisional general secretary in Hazara Division Sardar Shahjehan Yusuf has withdrawn his nomination papers from NA-14 Mansehra-I constituency and said he would contest elections in PK-40.
Mr Yusuf’s father Sardar Mohammad Yusuf, a former federal minister, will contest elections in NA-14 as the PML-N nominee against Imran Saleem Swati of the PTI in that constituency.
Taimur Saleem Khan Swati of the PTI also withdrew nomination papers from NA-14 constituency leaving the field open to his party’s nominee, Imran Saleem Swati.
PTI’s Abdul Shakoor Lughmani also withdrew his nomination from NA-14. He will now contest elections in PK-40. PPP provincial general secretary Shujah Salim Khan is a candidate for NA-14 seat after withdrawal of NA-15 papers.

16,Swabi leaders blast PTI for doling out tickets to former lawmakers only,SWABI: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf local leaders and workers have resented the party’s decision to pick the former...,"SWABI: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf local leaders and workers have resented the party’s decision to pick the former lawmakers in award of poll tickets for national and provincial assembly seats in Swabi, fearing the decision would have far-reaching impact on the party’s election performance.
It is to be mentioned here that the ticket for NA-19, Swabi-I, has been awarded to former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, and ticket for PK-50, Swabi-II, has gone to his brother, Aqibullah Khan. Similarly, the tickets for NA-20, Swabi-II, and PK-53, Swabi-V, have been awarded to former minister Shahram Khan Tarakai, and PK-52, Swabi-IV, to his brother, Faisal Khan Tarakai.
The ticket for PK-49, Swabi-I, has gone to former MPA Rangaiz Khan, while ticket for PK-51, Swabi-III, has been awarded to former adviser to chief minister, Abdul Karim.
Out of the seven constituencies of the district, three tickets have been awarded to Shahram’s family, while two have been allotted to Mr Qaiser’s family.
The party workers and leaders strongly resented the ‘unjust’ decision, saying they were being forced to vote for candidates of other parties.
A local leader told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the ‘diehard’ workers had been left high and dry after the party doled out tickets to a few influential people.
Some leaders blasted the party for awarding ticket for third straight time to former MPA Mr Rangaiz in PK-49 despite the fact that he had his vote in PK-50.
A leader belonging to Maneri Bala village said Major retired Fida should have been awarded ticket for PK-49 due to his sacrifices for the party.
He said the PTI decision would benefit candidates of other parties. He said it seemed Saeed Zada of Jamaat-i-Islami in PK-49, Ghafoor Khan Kaka of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl in PK-49 and Babar Saleem in PK-50 would clinch the seats.
Opposing the PTI decision on poll tickets, a jirga has nominated Salim Khan Jadoon and Omat Khan to contest PK-49 and NA-19 seats independently.
The jirga members said that the party continued to neglect the diehard workers and doled out tickets to Asad Qaiser and his brother, Aqibullah since 2013.

They demanded of the party leadership to provide justice to them as they were ignored in distribution of tickets. They alleged that tickets were issued to new entrants to the party.
Led by Malik Asif Shehzad, the founding worker of PTI and former president of Insaf Youth Wing, they told a press conference at Swat Press Club that they stood with PTI and its chief Imran Khan for the last 15 years. They said that they suffered every kind of hardships.
“From the sit-in in Islamabad to the events of May 9, we stood as soldiers even in difficult situations,” said Mr Shehzad. 
He added that they endured the hardships of imprisonment but did not retreat from the vision of PTI chief.
“For the last 15 years, we along with our family members and friends ran campaigns actively. We knocked at every door in upper Swat and Swat Kohistan,” he said. He added that for supporting his leader Imran Khan, several cases were registered against him.
“I was charged in 56 various cases, including anti-terrorism sections. I was imprisoned for committing no crime and was tortured. Still, none of us left PTI and Imran’s company,” he said. He said that he would continue to support Imran’s vision and serve his people politically.
“I was ignored in the 2013 and 2018 elections. I happily accepted the decision of party leadership. Even then, I did not get a ticket in the local body elections,” said Mr Shehzad.
He said that he was on the top of the list issued by the party for polls. He said that he was promised that he would be allotted a ticket for NA-2, but to his shock the party ticket was allotted to a candidate, who joined PTI a week ago.
“The people, who joined PTI on January 2, were allotted tickets on January 11, but those, who are associated with the party for 15 years, were ignored,” he said.
He said that they would soon announce their plan of action.

19,PTI divided in Bajaur over election tickets,Most aspirants likely to contest polls as independents,"BAJAUR: Differences have surfaced in the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) over the award of election tickets here.
Most aspirants, who were denied nominations, are likely to contest the Feb 8 polls as independent candidates, sources in the former ruling party told Dawn.
Bajaur district has one National Assembly and four provincial assembly seats.
The PTI has fielded PTI district president and former lawmaker Gul Zafar Khan in NA-8 constituency, former provincial minister and PTI provincial vice-president Anwar Zeb Khan in PK 20, former MNA Gul Dad Khan in PK-22, former provincial assembly member Engineer Ajmal Khan, the elder brother of Mr Gul Dad Khan, in PK 21 and Dr Hamidur Rehman, a relative of Gul Zafar Khan, in PK-19.

Most aspirants likely to contest polls as independents

All those aspiring for the National Assembly and provincial assembly election tickets had contested the 2018 and 2019 elections as party nominees, according to party activists.
From among only Dr Hamidur Rehman, who won the last election overwhelmingly, was named as the candidate.
Sixteen PTI activists, including senior and highly-qualified persons, had applied for party’s election tickets.
Among them were Rehan Zeb Khan, Engineer Khista Mohammad, Dr Yousaf Danish, Assadullah Khilji, Raheem Dad Khan and Luqman Khan.
None of the fresh ticket aspirants were nominated for election though some of them have been associated with the party for a long time and even remained behind bars for several weeks after the May 9 violent protests were staged against the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan in Islamabad.
Sources in the party said most of those denied tickets would contest elections as independents and were likely to announce that in separate news conferences on Monday.
Most PTI activists expressed reservations about the award of election tickets by their party to former lawmakers, especially to Mr Gul Dad Khan and his elder brother Engineer Ajmal Khan, saying the two failed to deliver as assembly members and didn’t stay in contact with them after the election.
