0,Hakra River comes back to life,"In the wake of Hakra River's rejuvenation, a village along its bank has witnessed a remarkable transformation.","“Fortunately, my land is on the bank of the Hakra River,” says 35-year-
old Ghulam Mohammad Chandio. “Taking advantage of this proximity,
and flood water from the river, I have cultivated my four hundred acres
of my land.”
Due to heavy rains and floods, the last three years, from 2020 to 2023,
have been very blessed and delightful for people in Chandio’s village of
Talhi Haji Jaffar Khan Chandio, about ten kilometers south of Nabisar
Road Town, near the right bank of the Hakra River.
Presently, what used to be their arduous lives have transformed into
joyous ones, while an economically struggling area has become
prosperous.
In these three years, Chandio has purchased three tractors for
cultivation and land preparation, apart from one vehicle for personal
use. “I have also constructed a new house in my village,” he says. “So
Hakro and flood are a blessing and bliss for us.
Perils of the past
Previously, from 1993 to 2020, his family struggled with finances. Even
with five hundred acres of agricultural land, managing daily expenses
was difficult, because their land lay wasted and uncultivated due to the
shortage of irrigation water. Since Chandio’s land is downstream of the
water irrigation system in Sanwari Shakh, the family witnessed some
hard times because they had no other source of income other than this
land which lay wasted. “We started selling our land bit by bit,” he said,
“and ended up selling a hundred acres just to be able to run the daily
expenses at home.”
But Chandio knew all along that selling off land was not the solution to
their financial woes. “If we continuously sell our land, in a few years, we
will have nothing left,” he realised.
He decided to leave the village to search for a job and found work as a
labourer in a textile mill in Karachi. “My salary was three thousand
rupees per month and certainly not enough for our family expenses,”
shares Chandio, who asked his younger brother, Mohammad Khan, to
leave the village and join him to work at the textile mill. They both
began to earn Rs 6000 and were able to afford to eat at least two meals
a day.
It seemed as though Chandio had created a pathway for young men
from his village to come to Karachi to work. “After my brother came to
Karachi, many other young fellows came one by one from our village
and started working with us and in other factories,” he says, adding
that by that time, many peasants in the village had ended up selling all
their land to meet the cost of living.
The surrounding area of the Hakro River, downstream of the water
irrigation system includes the southern districts of Umerkot,
Mirpurkhas, and Badin and near the Tharparkar desert in Sindh. This
uncultivated area which is approximately more than a hundred
kilometers from east to west begins from Chelbind, a little bus stop in
Umerkot district, to the Arabian Sea and Shakoor Lake.
Many families relocated to upper Sindh to find work as labourers, while
families who stayed behind began to cut wood for sale in nearby towns
such as Nabisar, Talhi, Naukot, and Bricks Bitha, which at the time was
the only source of income for the people in this area. “We only earned
two to three hundred rupees per day from wood cutting,” says Haji
Wasan. “In the jungle, many times we were attacked by bees.”
Drinking water was another issue at the time in the whole area and not
a one drop was available for birds, bees, animals, or people. People dug
wells and installed handpumps to meet drinking water needs of people
living in the area. This situation started after 1993 and 1992,” says 70-year-old peasant
Bhoro Bhel from village Nahtoo. “Previously, these lands were irrigated
with barrage water systems because, water-pumping machines were
not permitted in watercourses, therefore every farmer took his own
water from the water-irrigation channel.
“Water pumping machines were also used for stealing other people’s
water,” he adds. “Therefore, these machines made our area a
wasteland. Water-pumping machines are the main reason for the
shortage of water in this area. The irrigation water slowly became a
profitable business, with many shareholders including the local
feudals, elected members, Sindh Irrigation and Drainage
Authority, and the irrigation department being the prime
shareholders.”
The prosperous present
However, the floods have changed the entire situation in the area,
because Hakro is the main drain for flood water in Sindh, as it crosses
this area on its way to the Arabian Sea and Shakoor Lake.
The Hakro, an ancient river in Sindh, has not flowed for centuries and
the local inhabitants called it the dead river. Abdul Qadir Junejo the
renowned Sindhi and Urdu writer has written a novel &quot;The Dead River”
based on the Hakro river.
In the colonial era, the Hakro River was used from Dhoronaro town
district, Umerkot, Sindh, to the Arabian Sea only in flood times for
discharging the flood and flash flood water. After the colonial period,
the river slowly converted into an abandoned marsh. Only a thin line of
its existence remained on the maps of Sindh.
But the flood of 2011 again brought the Hakra river to life as it started
flowing from the north behind the sand dunes of the Thar desert.
“After a long time, when Hakro began flowing in 2011, the peasants
were not prepared for cultivation,” says Imran Ali Dars, a 40-year-old
peasant from Nabisar, Thar city. “Hence, the peasants could not benefit
from the flood water in the river. After that, Hakro began to flow every
year for four to five months. Some peasants started cultivation using
flood water but in 2000, Hakro fluxed continuously for eight months.
This excited all the peasants enough to prepare their land and begin
cultivation.”
Gradually, the area transformed, with land prices increasing from Rs
40,000 to Rs 0.8 million, but the peasants did not want to sell their land
now at any rate. After years of being a wasteland, Hakro had made
their land precious.
Because of the flood water, the ground water level increased from 115
feet to 45 feet, and as a result, many farmers installed tubewells on
solar panels. Some fisherman families from Badin and Naukot arrived to
fish in the flood water.
“I was the first person who installed the first solar panel tubewell in the
area,” says Chandio. “People of my area would tell me that it would not
be a feasible idea. I ignored them and installed a tubewell which is
hugely successful. All women in the area take drinking water from
here, and men carry water on motorcycles and other vehicles.
One day of water from the solar panel tubewell is enough for one acre
of cultivated land. Following Chandio, other peasants also installed
solar tubewells in the area. “The water from tubewells is not excellent
for agriculture because the EC (Electrical conductivity) level is high,”
says Arshad Ali. “But it is acceptable for agriculture because it is better
than having no water.”
Talking about flood water being utilised for agriculture, Bhawani
Shanker, a senior scientist of soil and the divisional head of soil and
water testing laboratories at Mirpurkhas division, says &quot;There is no hard
and fast theory about whether using flood water is beneficial or not for
land and crops, because it depends on the effusion of flood water.”
He explained that if water is drained from a salty or garbage area, then
it is bad for cultivation and drinking purposes, despite the fact that
generally rain water is considered beneficial for cultivation.
“Peasants must test water and soil before using flood water and ground
water for agriculture and drinking,” says Shankar. “After testing, we can
also suggest what type of crops can be cultivated in the area. Water
and soil testing charges are nominal, such as Rs 10 to 20 rupees per test
of soil or water.
Peasants could use flood water mixed with irrigation water to cultivate
salt-resistant crops, but the suggestions from the laboratory are based
on test results. In many countries, river water is also tested before use.
As livestock is rapidly increasing in the villages in the Tharparkar desert,
water from tubewells and the river is used for drinking and cooking. If
the growers test their land soil and water in laboratories, then could
enjoy more benefits from the flood water.
Where on one side, we heard horrific tales of damages caused by the
flood in upper Sindh, on the other hand, the flood water of the ancient
Hakra river has tremendously contributed to prosperity in the southern
district of Sindh and after a long time, the inhabitants of riverside
villages have returned to their homeland.

1,The power of food,Two cooks cross paths in their culinary journeys which are as different from each other,"Food is power. That is established from the outset in Thai film Hunger, recently released on
Netflix Pakistan. We may associate food with warmth and comfort, a feeling of security, a sense
of togetherness when sitting down to enjoy a meal with others. Not so for Chef Paul (Nopachai
Chaiyanam), Bangkok’s most vied gourmet chef who enjoys a cult following among the elites of
Thailand.
The kitchen led by the renowned chef runs on rigor no less than a boot camp, where
cooks are quite literally fighting for their survival. You’ve never known how to utilise time
unless you’ve prepped for service under Chef Paul. You’ve not known precision unless he has
approved the thickness of a slice carrot or the char on a sliver of $400 Wagyu beef.
Paul is not producing food to warm the cockles of the heart of his customers. He’s creating food
to expand his empire, magnify his profile, and make people bow at his feet. At Hunger, if you
can’t cut it, you are eliminated from the crew no matter how long you have been working there.
Unaware of the world of affluence catered by Hunger, young and lanky Aoy (Chutimon
Chuengcharoensukying) tosses noodles in a wok at the window of her father’s greasy spoon. Day in
and day out, she slaves away hitting hot wok to blazing fire making Pad Se Ew. So expertly does
she wield this wok that it seems to be an extension of her long limbs, and it is used as a motif
throughout the film. At the end of the day, her younger sister and her friend huddle over a table
with their favourite and filling bowls of food and share their daily troubles with her. One day,
Tone, a sous chef at Hunger, is seduced by the aroma wafting out of the crowded noodle joint.
One bite of the house special is all it takes for him to approach the chef, Aoy, and leave her with
the enigmatic business card of Chef Paul’s kitchen with her.
Accepting the invitation and the guidance of Tone is the beginning of Aoy making independent
choices for her life. At the upscale kitchen, Chef Paul gives her a dream and ambition to follow.
Aoy is impressionable and lost with nothing much to look forward to before she sets foot in
Hunger. Meeting Chef Paul changes her world completely as she acknowledges the drive she has
in herself to become “something special”. But her world changes at a larger level too. She also
begins to view not just the gourmet industry but society through the eyes of this larger than life
man whose own appetite for power seems irrepressible.
Paul is colder than ice and harder than stone when it comes to caring for clients or people. He’s
the personification of the trite and exasperating maxim ‘it’s not personal, it’s business.’ Whereas
he has made his clientele all the way into the upper echelons of society, serving politicians and
army generals, he holds his customers in secret contempt. Chef Paul does not just serve food to
the rich, he gives them a performance. The height of the spectacle is at the climax of the film when he maneuvers a face-off with Aoy at a lavish costume party of one Madam Milky. After
Aoy serves the first course with flair and flavour, Paul takes the spotlight when a whole carcass
of a cow descends to the floor via a fly system and the chef literally attacks it with a machete and
then flings some seasoning on it with all his might. That’s the dish done. The party gorges on the
meat in some cannibal orgy.
Paul upturns Aoy’s simple worldview when he shows her that his power lies not in his culinary
talent but in the way he sells it. His narcissism stems from being a housemaid’s child who was
caught tasting caviar from her mother’s employers’ fridge. He lived his life hating caviar —“it
tasted like shit” he tells Aoy — and hating the wealthy who subjected him and his mother to
humiliation because of his innocent transgression. Aoy never says it in words but she has lived a
life of being loved, albeit one of meager means. The restaurant her father runs has been in the
family, and the recipes used are her grandmother’s. She has a small but tight-knit family where
relationships matter the most. Aoy is used to having people love the flavour of the food she
makes, not how it looks.
Other than the class conflict that the film displays, there is also the theme of vulnerability versus
accountability when one is in a position of power. Chef Paul’s downfall occurs when he
arrogantly defies the law and hunts an exotic bird in a forest. Yes, pretty much everything in this
film is pregnant with symbolism. Aoy cannot forgive this brutal act and it is the decisive moment
for her to finally part ways with her tormenting mentor.
Even as Paul faces the humiliation of being publicly arrested for this willful transgression, he has
a very Pakistani belief in his enduring clout and fame. I’ll be back, he threatens Aoy, this won’t
stop me. Even as he exits, he reminds her that she will always remain under his shadow,
perpetually unable to beat him — also a familiar workplace sentiment that most Pakistani women
will relate to. The Pakistani viewer of the film, though, may find the denouement a bit incredible
and mildly confusing. Flouting an environmental law is hardly the cause of as much disgrace for
the rich and famous in our country. Elite businesses running under fashionable labels in Pakistan
circumvent tax laws, human rights and labour laws as a routine. Dismantling a high-flying chef’s
career because he defied the protection of wildlife seems like an overreaction to us.
What will Aoy do after she has witnessed the result of avarice in her teacher? Will she reclaim
the fine dining experience and food industry to be a service that makes clients feel happy or will
she too become the master manipulator of capitalist illusions as she was taught? It’s a fine line
between greed and hunger, and director Sitisiri Mongkolsiri constructs it with a tempered hand.
There is much attention to detail in the visual narrative, yet the frames are kept open and direct,
nothing to overwhelm or assault the senses. The complexities of the plot are conveyed with a
grounded clear-sightedness and the moral of the film is presented simply.

2,Why Hepburn is still the fairest lady,"To mark 31 years past her death anniversary, an ardent Hepburn fan pays a tribute to one of the most iconic actor","I was introduced to Audrey Hepburn, courtesy her famous movie
“My Fair Lady' when I was nine. Puppy love might be
inappropriate to represent my growing fondness for her but it was
an innocent infatuation, but more of the the type that one feels for
a class teacher when one is in grade one, would be a more
accurate representation of what I felt.
My father to literally forced me to watch the movie three times. In
the film, Rex Harrison (Prof Higgins) is a teacher, who attempts to
teach proper English to a flower girl from the street, played by
Audrey Hepburn. Frustrated in his endeavours to groom her, Prof
Higgins in the process gets emotionally entangled with the much
younger flower girl, who drives him mad with her antics.
With three viewings soundly under the belt, I was expected to
remember and narrate, some choice dialogues that Father was
fond of, such as, &quot;the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain or the lyrics of the song sung in exasperation by Prof Higgins, based on Alan Jay Lerner poetry, the lyrics of which are most interesting,
“Women are irrational, that is all to them, their heads are full of
cotton hand rags, they are nothing but exasperating, irritating,
vacillating, calculating, arguing, maddening, infuriating and...why
can’t a woman be more like a man - men are so honest, so
thoroughly square, eternally noble, historically fair, when you win
will always give your back a pat, so why can’t a woman be more.”
In as much pain Audrey Hepburn had in saying the various
dialogues, I was no better… but to please him, I parroted these
lines, to deliver repeatedly, in the presence of my Father and his
coterie of friends who would arrive every Sunday morning for a
tête-à-tête over this, that and the other. Eventually, I grew up
asking, why can’t women be more like men…?
Audrey Kathleen Hepburn, a British actress was born on May
4th,1929, in the Belgian city of Ixelles. Eleven years ago, she died
in January 1993, of colon cancer, as peacefully and innocently, as
her face radiated through her life. She had married twice, the first
marriage to Andrea Doti lasted fourteen years; the second a year
less than the first.
In spite of an amazingly friendly relationship with Dad, I never
could muster courage to ask him in later years, why did he like
Audrey Hepburn so much and what for in particular? I could
conjure a million reasons, as per my understanding and
assessment, but I was never was able to discover what his views
were. I don’t think, he missed watching any film of hers.
In the film Charade, her co-star was Cary Grant, who in my view
resembled my dad a lot, and strangely enough, this made me
even more besotted by her beauty.
Hepburn was one of Hollywood’s most-loved actresses, who
nature had blessed with amazing beauty, youthful innocence, enticing sophistication and elegance. Regardless of the role she would be playing, all these virtues stood out prominently. In the
years 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1980, 1987 and 1991,
Hepburn appeared on the list of International Best Dressed Hall of
Fame List founded by fashionista Eleanor Lambert in 1940. No
wonder, Audrey once remarked, “Life is a party, dress like it.”
Hepburn was globally recognised as a film and fashion icon. She
received rankings from the American Film Institute, as the third
greatest female screen legend. With an impressive height at 5’7,
she possessed amazing grace, elegance and poise. The
statement, elegance is an attitude, most suited her. “Elegance,”
she said, “is the only beauty that never fades.” Being confident of
her elegant stature, she never succumbed to making changes in
her style. Her reaction to change, was “Why change? Everyone
has their own style. When you have found it, you should stick to
it.” Hepburn was keenly focussed on the purpose of her
existence. “I don’t take my life seriously, but I do take what I do in
my life quite seriously.”
Hepburn and Gregory Peck bonded incredibly well on the screen,
in the most captivating film “The Roman Holiday” released in 1953
and shot entirely in Italy. At the time, she was only 24 years old,
while Peck was 37. Joe Bradley played by Peck, was a
photographer by profession who spends an entire day,
unbeknownst to himself, in the company of the runaway Princess
Anne played by Hepburn. Speaking about Hepburn, Peck had the
following to say:
“With Audrey it was very easy, under the circumstances, to fall in
love and have very tender feelings about her.” In spite of this
blanching comment, he and Hepburn always denied “romantic
entanglement.” While Hepburn had said, “Actually, you have to be
a little bit in love with your leading man and vice versa.”
If both were lying, it made little difference to their star-struck fans,
because on the celluloid screen, they looked so lovingly at each
other. Anyone would fall head over heels for either of them,
depending on the gender differentiation and preference.
As the duo had beautiful personalities, the imagination of their
admirers could run amok with the insistence of their “a little bit in
love” contention. For Hepburn, love probably meant, “They say
love is the best investment, the more you give, the more you get
in return.”
I watched The Roman Holiday on PTV, which being independent
and less controlled in my childhood years, regularly screened
classic Hollywood films. Hepburn received an Oscar Award for
Best Actress (1954) for the film, and in her glee and excitement,
left the trophy in the ladies’ room.
It is interesting to know that neither Hepburn, nor Peck were the
first choices for this film. Elizabeth Taylor was the original choice,
but couldn’t accommodate the shooting schedule. On the other
hand, Cary Grant declined to work with her on the plea and
pretext that she was too young for him to act with, just the way in
Bollywood, Dilip Kumar had also declined several films to act with
Saira Bano on the same basis, but he later married her, despite
the 22 years age difference. However, Grant didn’t marry Hepburn
ofcourse! In Funny Face, her co-star Fred Astaire, the dancing
miracle, was three decades older than her.
In “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” playing the 31-year-old Holly Golightly,
Hepburn stunned with her radiant, moonlit face and virtuous
grace. A tremendously popular picture of hers from this film
shows her dressed elegantly in black Givenchy dress smoking a
cigarette, with a long filter attached to it in a restaurant. Eternally
enamoured by Hepburn, some years ago, I asked my teenage sons to take a picture of me seated across Hepburn’s wax statue at Madam Tussaud.
In a piece on Hepburn, Claudia Moscovici, novelist and art/literary
critic, calls her the symbol of classic and classy femininity. “With
an unforgettable elfish, delicate and childlike beauty and her
extraordinary talents in acting, languages and dance, Hepburn is
also known as an avid humanitarian. In her later life, she
completely devoted herself to humanitarian work. She received a
Presidential Medal for her services. Her motto was, the best thing
to hold onto in life is each other.” Genuine compassion and steely
strength of character describes Hepburn the best. “I believe in
being strong when everything seems to be going wrong “, she
remarked.
Her 10 best films according to The Guardian are as follows:
10. Breakfast at Tiffany’s (1961)
Truman Capote initially chose Marilyn Monroe as the heroine of
his novella, but the film role went to Hepburn, whom Photoplay
had called “altogether un-Marilyn Monroeish.” The film made her
an icon of timeless chic in her little black Givenchy dress.
9. Paris When It Sizzles (1964)
Hepburn plays a typist hired to help a screenwriter (William
Holden) meet his deadline and is surprisingly funny and foxy as a
comic femme fatale.
8. How to Steal a Million (1966)
What fun to see Hepburn hiding in a cupboard with an age-
appropriate leading man at last. Peter O’Toole plays the debonair
burglar she enlists to help her steal a fake Cellini statuette. More
ultra-mod Givenchy outfits and charlady disguise for Hepburn.
7. The Nun’s Story (1959)
Hepburn’s best performances are the ones where she doesn’t
appear to be acting. As a Belgian nun whose faith is variously
tested by nursing in the Congo, Peter Finch’s handsome but
agnostic doctor, and the Nazi occupation in Belgium.
6. Wait Until Dark (1967)
Hepburn plays a blind woman in this tense thriller.
5. Two for the Road (1967)
This time, Hepburn is seven years elder to Albert Finney as her
husband here. She swaps Givenchy for groovy Carnaby Street
gear in this relationship drama about an unhappily married couple
driving south through France, with flashbacks of same journey in
happier times.
4. Roman Holiday (1953)
Hepburn won her Oscar for the role that propelled her to stardom.
Fed up of her life as a princess, Ann gallivants around Rome with
American journalist Peck, rides a Vespa, and gets a pixie cut.
3. Robin and Marian (1976)
Almost the same age as Sean Connery, Hepburn’s love interest in
the film where Maid Marian is ticked off that Robin ditched her to
go globetrotting.
2. Funny Face (1957)
Hepburn plays an intellectual bookseller who gets a chic
makeover (even though she looks perfectly chic to begin with) in
this delightful musical. Fred Astaire, 30 years older than his
leading lady, plays a photographer who whisks her off to Paris for
a fashion shoot.
1. Charade (1963)
The best Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never made: Givenchy-
clad Hepburn at her most adorable, with 25-year-older Cary Grant
as the suave mystery man who saves her from MacGuffin-hunting
thugs. No one flees for their life quite as prettily as Audrey, and
Paris has never looked lovelier.
Happiness to Audrey Hepburn was, “I love people who make me
laugh. I honestly think it is the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a
multitude of Ills.” From this underlying philosophy stemmed, the
purpose of life, to her; “The most important thing is to enjoy your
life. To be happy. It’s all that matters.”
Hepburns’ black Givenchy dress from Breakfast At Tiffanys was
auctioned at Christie's in London in December 2006. The
estimated sale price was between £50,000 and £70,000, but it
was bought by an anonymous buyer by telephone for a record-
breaking £467,200. Clearly, we are all still obsessed with her and
my dilemma of why can’t a woman be more like a man remains
unresolved!

3,Mobility in an unequal city,The lack of willingness to identify mobility challenges hamper the availability of mobility solutions in Karachi,"Innovation in mobility is proceeding at a fast pace. However, urban centres are facing an array of
challenges in its wake, such as ageing populations, urbanisation and pollution. The scenario is
more complex in the Global South as mobility is not limited to the above factors alone, it is also
tied up with governance patterns, gender, availability of modes, affordability, infrastructure,
climate change, sustainability, and decision-making in support of mobility. In developing
nations, automation and electric propulsion are disrupting technologies in connection to micro-
mobility in terms of sustainability and expense of installation to operation and maintenance.
In Karachi, we encounter numerous obstacles such as inadequate infrastructure, absence of
public transportation, poorly planned routes, gender-related mobility issues, high population
densities, an ageing population and individuals with varying abilities, unprotected open drains,
road imperfections, traffic congestion, frequent accidents, limited affordability, and the influence
of sociocultural norms. Why can’t we follow the principles of responsible upgradation and
innovation? Why not try for a renewed mobility which provides access to all across the city?
The lack of institutional and political willingness to identify mobility challenges hamper the
availability of affordable and feasible mobility solutions in the metropolis.
Cities need to change their priorities
Pakistan’s most populous city needs to change. With the highest congestion rates in Pakistan
compounded with problems of pollution, Karachi is constantly evolving, but the city’s
administration fails to update the infrastructure and services, including public transportation
which was quite good and adequate in the past.
The problem with our policymakers is that they think building more expansive and improved
highways helps to manage urban transportation issues. In contrast, the tenets of sustainable
transportation promote the use of affordable public transportation that might function effectively
in cities like Karachi with large densities and diversified land use. Globally, public transportation
is a useful tool for tackling a variety of societal issues, including mobility, sustainability, and
liveability.
Public buses vs BRT projects
Karachi, home to 25-30 million, is not evenly spread but follows the urban/rural divide
characterising many of the prevalent socio-economic phenomena. A mobility project with
automation and artificial intelligence requires a large sum of money (for instance the BRT
project). It is very expensive and not affordable for the urban poor. While it can be installed, it would be a burden for a developing country like Pakistan. Additionally, it would require ongoing
financial support and pose a challenge in managing its advanced technology and maintenance
needs. Furthermore, the project only covers a single route, serving a small portion (five to seven
percent) of the city's population.
Four different projects of mobility (for instance, public transport bus routes) can be started with
the same finance without automation, not subsidised. Operation and maintenance can be done
locally and can cover four different routes to serve 20 percent of the city’s population.
Ultimately, encouraging shifts toward public transportation could be made possible through
integrated public transport planning which combines different modes of transport to maximise
ease and efficiency.
Mobility options in Karachi’s planning - Present and Past
Karachiites have to leave their homes or places of employment hours in advance, yet they still
arrive late due to clogged traffic on roads. This results in time loss, extreme exhaustion from
constant travel, and carbon pollution from exhaust fumes. Heavy traffic bottlenecks will
undoubtedly occur when there are 30 cars on the road instead of one bus. We can look at
Singapore as an example to emulate in order to overcome this predicament. The Singaporean
government discourages personal vehicles and encourages public transportation. In Singapore,
53 percent of the populace has been persuaded to use public transportation.
Outdated infrastructure exacerbates Karachi&#39;s traffic problems. In some areas in the city where
underpasses, flyovers, and at-grade roads are present, congestion is still common throughout the
day, not just during rush hour. Examples are the Nazimabad stops or the Liaquatabad 10 number
stop.
Commuting is a daily hardship for the citizens of Karachi whether they live in the city centre or
its periphery. The first challenge is affordability. The main issue is Karachi&#39;s ongoing inability to
create and manage its public transportation networks in a way that offers a high level of mobility,
equity, and environmental sustainability. Additionally, carbon emissions in urban areas can be
greatly reduced by using public transportation, walking, and cycling. Several aspects, like the
significance of governance, capacity building and urban planning, must be considered in addition
to climate change to provide effective public transportation in Karachi.
In the past, we had several examples of urban mobility: buses run by the Karachi Transport
Corporation, the Karachi Circular Railway, and tramways. As the city expanded, and densified,
we failed to adapt those services to the changing dynamics of the city. Now urban mobility is a
monstrous challenge for a large segment of society. As city planners, we are often asked for
solutions.
While we can suggest people-centred approaches based on urban mobility planning,
the approval and implementation of these ideas are beyond our control. Political motivation is
required to benefit everyday citizens and provide them with affordable services that adapt to the
changing dynamics of the city.
Mobility with safety – Gendered lens
Mobility is the lifeblood of civilisations as it spurs economic activity and shapes societies. Cities
depend on robust transportation systems for their growth and sustenance. The gradual
resumption of economic activity in Karachi has been accompanied by demands to normalise
Karachi’s public transport system. Karachi Urban Lab’s last project Land, Governance and
Gendered Politics of Displacement in Urban Pakistan recorded harrowing narratives of people
commuting from Lyari Basti, Taiser Town to the city centre for over four hours a day, by
changing three vehicles which are also beyond their affordability. Additionally, working women
are unable to make such arrangements. With the building of Lyari Expressway, people who were
living in Karachi&#39;s district central were forcefully displaced and resettled in Karachi's periphery,
21 km away from their previous homes. The city’s administration has failed to provide
affordable public transport to them.
Another issue is the safety of commuters. We do not have specific guidelines for the safety of
rules to be followed in all modes of transport. Mobility for females has a variety of challenges;
no safety at bus stops, and limited seating capacity as they wait for 30 minutes for a bus. Socio-
cultural barriers also exist, as women cannot select the bike services available in the city for
affordable commuting. Also, carpooling is impossible within this framework. Some of my
students at Karachi University told me that to reach the Urban Resource Center, located at
Baloch Colony, they gather at Nipa Chowrangi and share a ride-hailing cab to commute.
Although, riding a motorcycle is a good option for them but not acceptable in our society.
Karachi’s Public Transport system is the worst globally
A study by car-parts company Mister Auto that looked at 100 major cities in 2019, published in
Bloomberg, ranked Karachi as having the worst public transport system globally. Bogota was the
second-worst city, while it has an Integrated Public Transport System including BRT, Bus, and
Gondola lift services. Although, in 2000 Bogotá introduced the first BRT system to combine the
best elements of a BRT and achieved the highest capacity and highest speed BRT system in the
world, in terms of the public transport system, Bogota is the second worst globally. Policy
designers and decision makers must take note of this example that having a BRT system (not
comparing the quality of service here) does not mean having the best public transport system.
We can also see this in New York, Singapore, Tokyo, and London.
Under the Karachi Mobility Project, in 2019, the World Bank submitted an Environmental
Impact Assessment report to the Sindh Mass Transit Authority. The report revealed that, “There
were over 12,000 public transport vehicles (including buses, minibuses, and coaches) serving
267 routes in the city owned by private transporters. However, the number of buses has
decreased steadily and reached less than 5,000 in 2017, serving only about 100 routes.
City officials in Karachi make grand promises about the future of public transport, but
unfortunately, these promises go unfulfilled. They claim that a few buses, like the People's bus service, will be enough to meet the needs of the 25 million residents.
This seems like nothing more than a dream, as the reality of the situation suggests otherwise.
Integrated Public Transport Scenario in Karachi
The map showing the routes of the New Red Bus in Karachi (called Peoples Bus Service) is very
impressive and gives a sense that we are connected by a public transport system. However, in
reality, this cannot be further from truth. For a city of 25 million, a total of 250 buses will operate
on 14 routes in Karachi, which include eight routes of red buses, three routes of electric buses and
three routes of pink buses. Keep in mind that these Red Buses have a seating capacity of around
40 people with dedicated spaces for ladies, along with standing capacity of around 40 more
persons. If we add, the Green Line BRT’s 80 buses – with a seating capacity of 40 seats, Orange Line
BRT’s 20 buses with a seating capacity of 31 each.
Now we must look at what Karachi demands. According to the World Bank, there needs to be
one bus with 100 seats for every 1,500 population, keeping in line with the internationally
accepted ratio.
However, considerably fewer government buses, a total of 350 – max 40-seaters – are currently
running on the roads of Karachi.
According to the World Bank report, a rapid decline can be seen in public transport during the
last decade due to insufficient investment in the sector or shifting of investment from transport to
real estate, which is a 100 times more profitable business in the city. Despite an increase in the
price of fuel, this has led to a shift in demand from public transportation towards other modes of
transportation, such as motorcycles, private cars, and informal Qingqi rickshaws.
As of mid 2018, there were 4.6 million registered vehicles in Karachi — mainly motorcycles and
cars, which increased up to 6.8 million in mid 2022 (only up-to 800 cc vehicles and motorcycles
included) — where motorcycles account for 86 percent of the total registered vehicles. On the
other hand, public transport (para transport not included) accounts for only 0.5 percent of the
total registered vehicles. While the growth rates for motorcycles was 120 percent, between 2011
and 2018 are now over 200 percent in the last 10 years. Now 1,000 new vehicles have been
added to the streets of the city each day.
We are not prioritising eco friendly options
Cities across the world have given cycling and walking a boost as popular ways of
transportation. 90 cities were ranked by the Global Bicycle Index 2022 to see which ones are the
most bicycle friendly. The index gave the cities points based on the proportion of cyclists, crime
and safety, infrastructure, the outside temperature, the availability of bike sharing, and cycling-
related activities.
The highest number of &quot;cyclable&quot; days and high-quality bicycle infrastructure,
such as bike lanes, can be found in European cities, which also have the most bike-friendly
environments overall. The bicycle-friendliest city in the world is Utrecht, Netherlands. The
indicator indicates that roughly 51% of people in the city are using bicycles. The German city of
Münster comes in second on the list.
In Pakistan, we don’t have a track for cycling. The first one is in planning in Islamabad, but what
about other cities? It is not our priority to support non-carbon-emitting commute options.
Bicycles should be the vehicle of choice for a great majority of Karachi’s residents. It seems like
the perfect option for a metropolis like Karachi which struggles with a decent public transport
system. Most of its population is young or people engaged in the informal economy, working
class and cannot afford to independently own or sustain a motor vehicle, but need to constantly
navigate the sprawling megacity for work or education. Yet, unlike most urban metropolises
around the world, bicycling remains a rather unpopular mode of transport here. In fact, cycling is
often perceived as an activity for the well-off, who view it as a fitness endeavour or a weekend
hobby.
A lesson from the world
Let us look at the underlying paradoxes in Karachi&#39;s transport landscape and the possible way
forward.
For the best public transport system, we need to focus on some factors including routes, distance
to public transit, affordability in terms of low fares, operating hours, crowding and commute
speeds and number of buses, limited delays or service disruptions, and a financial model to
support itself.
People need the accessibility, reliability, and affordability of the public transportation system in a
metropolitan area. Their choice is not specific to a BRT or MRT. They first need a bus transit
system and once we have that, the next step would be to move towards an integrated public
transport system with BRT and MRT (if we can afford to bear the installation and operational
cost).
The reality is that Karachi lacks reliable public transit, forcing everyone to drive their own
vehicles. This problem is not unique to Karachi, as many large and expanding metropolitan areas
across the world, including Los Angeles, Tokyo, Cairo, and Sao Paolo, are facing increasing
traffic congestion. To plan a public transport system in Karachi, first we need current data on
demand and supply, which includes the ratio of the dedicated public transport infrastructure (Bus
Transit, and BRT,) per capita and per overall road length, as well as data on the share of
residents who want to use public transportation to commute. Better planning, and more focus on
accessibility and ease of public transport can contribute to the fall in density of road traffic.

4,Learning behind bars,Education and skill-building opportunities in prisons empowers ex-offenders to reintegrate into society,"When prisoners are released after completing their sentence, they face an environment that is challenging and actively deters them from becoming productive members of society. They struggle to find work, and people think they are dangerous and bad. Hence ex-prisoners are rejected from the society they are trying to reenter. This social rejection can have such a strong effect on former prisoners
Often, ex-offenders are rearrested. It is also seen that recidivism or the re-arrest, reconviction, or re-incarceration of an ex-offender within a given time frame harms both the families of inmates and society in general.
Once prisoners are released, it is more difficult for them compared to the general populace to find gainful employment, and generally function in society. Often viewed as sub-citizens, ex-offenders are perpetually punished for crimes. The causes of these restrictions are systemic and affect ex-offenders at all levels of society.
The total prison population of Pakistan is 87,712 (August 2022, UN Report), while the prison population rate (per 100,000 of national population is 38, based on an estimated national population of 230.02m.
While everyone else sees prisoners as aliens and culprits, Ehsam Ullah Baig sees them as human beings and a part of the society. In line with his views about prisoners, Baig laid the foundation of The
Jail Project along with friends in 2018 in Gilgit-Baltistan. But before he could proceed any further, the pandemic arrived. Fortunately, when circumstances got better in 2022, he restarted the project.
What is The Jail Project?
“We give prisoners two options, says Ehsam Ullah Baig, who heads The Jail Project. “They can either avail the opportunity to get education or learn skills while they are in jail.” Since the initiative targets prisoners’ betterment in society, facilities are provided to them for education, learning skills and personality development.
“When we started the project, we also came across some prisoners who were well-educated,” says Baig. “A couple of them had done their masters and one of them was an engineer.” Presently, there are some 300-400 prisoners in the Central Jail Minawer, Gilgit, but it is up to the prisoners to benefit from this opportunity.”
“There are no hard and fast rules to enroll in this project,” says Baig. “By law, it is a prisoner's right to get education in jail but unfortunately, until we took the initiative, there were no facilities available to them in jail for doing so.”
Initially, the programme turnout was quite significant, as out of around 300 prisoners, 100 enrolled with almost 50% opting for education and the rest went for skills. The said they wanted to utilise the time for something constructive in their lives and had opted for the project for skill training or acquiring education because they didn’t want to repeat the mistakes that they had made in the past.”
The prisoners who did not participate in the programme said that they were content with their status in regard to skills and education.
“We cannot tell you exactly who became a better individual after the programme,” says Baig. “But with the passage of time we could see an obvious change in their thought process and behaviour. We started this programme for their betterment, and that is what we focus on.”
How it started?
“When some fellows in my neighbourhood returned after completing their imprisonment, I realised that they were not able to fit in the society anymore and had difficulties being accepted,” shares Baig. An idea sparked in his mind and after some thought, he got some like-minded people together and pitched the idea to Naveed Ahmed, the District Commissioner of the time.
“We had no trouble in getting permission to start this project,” says Baig, “as previously, we had worked on a few projects for the government, so there were no credibility issues.”
Our motive
“Our core motive is that after being released from jail, the prisoners can re-adjust in the society and become good people and responsible citizens,” says Baig. “But there are no sources available to work on their personality while they are in jail, nor any kind of activity that keeps them connected to the outside world.”
Hence after being freed from jail, they feel a disconnect with the society. Once prisoners have completed their sentence, and step into the society, they are stigmatised as people who were previously criminals and are
considered dubious.”
This is why it is important to keep prisoners updated through education, conversation and discussions and activities with what was happening in the outside world, so that when they are set free, they don’t feel as if they have stepped out on the wrong planet.
“When you spend three, four or five years in jail, it is precious time lost while the outside world is changing all the time,” said Baig. It is essential for prisoners to know what has changed in the society, so they are prepared before they step out and survive in the new and changed environment.
“I believe that a jail is more of a rehabilitation centre, and not just a place for punishment,” says Baig, “This is the place where people get time to reflect and improve themselves. Otherwise, they feel lost and frustrated when they step out and may recommit crime and become habitual criminals.
How the project works
“We cannot provide a classroom atmosphere,” says Baig. “But twice or thrice a week, we arrange education and learning sessions for them.” Initially, Baig was not allowed to provide books and other material to prisoners, but with the passage of time as they came up with different ideas for education and learning, the prisoners were provided with books
and learning material.
With time, the project has progressed and presently, it works by connecting the prisoners to different education sources and government institutions.
“For prisoners who wanted to continue their education and attempt exams, we connected them to Allama Iqbal Open University,” shares Baig. For this, they have to apply to their superintendent and seek permission for exams.
“We work as vectors and facilitators, by connecting prisoners to the respective institutions that can help them.” For those who do not want to continue their education, ideas are pitched to the social welfare department to teach them skills.
Recently, Baig’s project team has met with the agriculture department to discuss introduction of activities such as gardening or kitchen gardening for prisoners. Presently, the rehabilitation and education project is working smoothly in the central jail in Gilgit.
“Logistically there are not so many expenses,” says Baig. “Initially, we spent from our pockets to buy books and stationery, however for connecting them to different institutes, there are no expenses involved.”
More than money and investment, the project demands a massive amount of time, because it takes time to build an image, trust and communication with prisoners.
“It is difficult to build a healthy conversation with someone who is in jail,” says Baig. “What kind of conversation would you expect from them? You cannot put your motive, or your plans in front of them straight away. First, you have to create a comfortable connection with them and then later you can discuss rehab ideas. Not just that, you also have to maintain your relationship with the staff of the jail. After a year or a couple of years, the staff gets changed and again you have to put in
an effort and build relations with the new staff.”
What’s next?
Baig runs the Pakistan Innovation Summit Education, a non-profit organisation, that works for education as well as several other projects with government, such as during the pandemic or floods. “We are working on a medical camp that will include blood screening and OPD,” shares Baig. “We will also try and teach them how to give first aid in an emergency although this type of facility is already available in jail.” Studies across the world indicate that education during incarceration has long term benefits for entire societies.
In fact, a report in the US suggests that individuals who participated in any form of educational programmes in prison were 43% less likely to return to jail. This is mostly because, among other factors, prison education has shown to have significant personal benefits in the form of higher chances of employment post release, greater political engagement and volunteerism, and improved health outcomes. On the other hand, ex-convicts who have low levels of education are often unable to find work or social support systems, thus increasing their chances of committing crimes and re-entering the prison
system.
Higher recidivism affects the entire population of a country because it diverts money and resources to the criminal justice system that could instead be spent on other community reform policies. Increased criminality also has intergenerational effects, with children of prisoners being more likely to have unstable family systems, lower economic resources, higher tendency of delinquent behaviour and eventually turning into criminals themselves. Investing on prison education, therefore, has a significantly high return value, saving taxpayers’ money that could be used in other development projects.

5,"Healthcare innovation, powered by AI","Human Centred Design Thinking with AI, sought to leverage cutting edge tools and approaches to solve clinical problems","Traditional healthcare systems and conventional learning processes have been in place in
Pakistan since the very beginning. Despite their longstanding presence, both have seen little
in terms of innovation and progress.
What if the recent technological breakthroughs could be integrated into our healthcare system, transforming the way it operates and delivers services?
Imagine if these cutting-edge tools and techniques could empower our healthcare professionals to acquire new skills and methods to save lives more effectively.
In an effort to tackle healthcare challenges through technology, AIM Consulting organised a two-day healthcare summit in collaboration with Aga Khan University Hospital. The primary goal was to digitise, foster innovation, apply design thinking, leverage emerging technologies, and revolutionise the entire healthcare system.
The master class at the summit focused on combining Human Centred Design Thinking (HCDT) – an effective
method for resolving challenging issues – with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to resolve clinical
problems.
“Combining the two works well in the age of generative AI,” said Dr Asad Mian, Director of CCIT Forum and Professor of Emergency Medicine at AKU. “We applied HCDT and generative AI together to a clinical problem in this master class, under an idea we have named ‘Create 2 innovate’ (C2i),” he explained.
The main idea behind enhancing learning and design thinking encompasses five key aspects that the workshop participants explored: empathise, define, ideation, prototyping, and testing. In the first phase, ‘empathise’, participants delve into understanding clinical issues from various perspectives, including those of patients and healthcare practitioners. This involves group discussions to explore diverse viewpoints.
Moving on to the ‘define’ stage, participants use acquired knowledge to articulate the problem clearly, engaging in collaborative efforts to refine the problem description. The third phase, ‘ideation’, involves employing generative AI as a brainstorming tool to generate original solutions, with teams visualising and developing concepts using this technology.
In the ‘prototyping’ stage, participants create concrete concepts or models for the proposed solutions, collaborating with AI technologies to sketch out prototypes. Finally, in the ‘testing’ stage, the solutions are evaluated, and revisions are made based on feedback. This includes showcasing prototypes to the group for improvement and comments, completing
the iterative design process.
The C2i concept involves AI-powered storytelling, elaborating a given scenario or medical problem in a way that allows even a layperson to not only comprehend it but offer initial treatment or manage the medical emergency.
AI-generated storytelling is a two-step process; shared Dr Mian. In the introduction phase, the scene is set, and a real-world clinical problem is described. For example, children experiencing an exacerbation of asthma being presented to the emergency room. The second step involves engagement to enhance the storytelling element, utilising generative AI to generate scenarios and visual representations, he added.
According to Dr Mian, C2i is not a novel concept. It has been employed in various scenarios to empower innovative teaching and learning. An example he shared was of the ‘Biloongra’ blog, where the titular character has been created to educate high school students about health literacy using innovative tools.
The motivation behind creating such content is to educate non-medical individuals on how to respond to an emergency in the absence of immediate medical assistance. While recognising that not every case can be managed by a layperson, disseminating basic knowledge of initial treatment is crucial. Initiatives like these can contribute to saving more
lives lost due to uninformed individuals.
Such awareness campaigns also prove valuable in emergency departments during times of crisis, explained the Professor of Emergency Medicine at AKU.
Through this practice and the master class, the generated content aims to address and utilise diverse approaches, essentially working at the intersection of various disciplines. The activity is designed to underscore the significance of HCDT in addressing complex clinical issues, in conjunction with fostering creativity, innovation, and cross-disciplinary
teamwork, said Dr Mian.
He added that it also highlights the transformative potential of regenerative AI in the healthcare industry. The creative and innovative workshop serves as a platform for participants to hone their storytelling skills within the context of clinical scenarios. It also provides valuable insights into HCDT and generative AI, showcasing their potential applications in healthcare. For instance, if a respiratory emergency is the chosen case, the initial steps involve empathising with the client/patient and assessing the severity of the problem.
Subsequently, defining the problem and conducting necessary analysis follow. After defining, the ideation process begins, where a solution is generated through divergent and design thinking. The main phase involves prototyping and utilising AI tools to craft the story and create illustrations that address the patient's problem. Finally, the solution undergoes testing to ensure its efficacy and comprehensibility for laypersons.
To create a connected set of illustrations, consistent characters were employed, allowing stories to be related with various ideas and issues. Dr Mian said awareness workshops have been also been conducted, and several more are in the pipeline, each spanning three to five days.
These workshops accommodate over 50 participants per class, organised into groups
of four to five participants each.

6,"New BRICS, new voice for Global South",Clear divisions over the Middle East crisis underscore the pressing need for an alternative to the US-led world order,"This week was an eventful one for the ever-escalating crisis in the Middle East, with a few critical
developments on both the Gaza and Red Sea fronts. The International Court of Justice took up a case
brought forth by BRICS member South Africa to prevent the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza at the
hands of Israel. The first two days of proceedings, which saw the legal representatives of South Africa
and Israel present their opening arguments, drew contrasting reactions from the ‘West and the rest’.
While much of the Global South and sympathetic voices in the Western nations hailed South Africa,
some key governments from the Global North rejected outright the main premise of the case. Germany,
declared its intention to intervene on Israel&#39;s behalf as a third party in the ICJ and dismissed the
accusation of genocide while affirming its support for Israel's right to self-defence. The United States
and Canada, similarly, announced that believed the case was ‘baseless’, even as Israel’s brutal offensive
in Gaza has claimed more than 23,000 lives, over 10,000 of them children.
Meanwhile, in response to for months of attacks by Houthi forces on Red Sea shipping, the United
States and United Kingdom launched dozens of air strikes across Yemen in what marked a serious
escalation in the conflict. US President Joe Biden held up the strikes as a “clear message that the United
States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil
freedom of navigation.&quot; The leaders of Yemen’s Houthi forces vowed to continue their attacks on
shipping for as long as Israel’s war on Gaza continues while threatening that “all American-British
interests have become legitimate targets for the Yemeni armed forces.”
As with the proceedings in ICJ, the reactions to the strikes by the US and the UK highlighted the sharp
split between the West and the region. While the nations seen as part of the US-led world order framed
the development as ‘defensive’ and tried to isolate it from Israel’s war in Gaza, Middle Eastern nations,
including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iran voiced grave apprehension and called for avoiding escalation.
This month, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iran, along with the United Arab Emirates and Ethiopia, formally
became part of the BRICS bloc, accepting the invitation extended to them by the five titular members at
last year’s summit in Johannesburg. Together, the 10 nations now represent 45 per cent of the world’s
population and, with a combined economy worth over $28.5 trillion, account for roughly 28 per cent of
the global economy. With the inclusion of the new members, they will also be producing about 44 per
cent of the world's crude oil.
Political divergences
While most of the analytical output on the potential and future of BRICS has focused on economy and
trade implications, the timing of developments in ongoing conflict in the Middle East draws sharp
attention towards the expanded grouping’s political impact. Under the US-led Western world order, the
Global South has often found itself a silent spectator to unilateral geopolitical actions. A mix of
militarism and economic ‘carrots and sticks’ have left many nations with no choice but to face the fallout, such as in the case of American intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. Issues that have been the
direct result of those ill-thought out wars continue to plague both those countries and their neighbours
to this day.
Similar unilateralism appears evident in the Israel-Palestine and Red Sea crisis – despite calls for tackling
the root of the issue, the United States has been upping the ante. Both Washington and other Western
governments have also sought to compartmentalise the two even though those issues and many others
that plague the Middle East and the rest of the Muslim world remain interconnected.
A recent opinion piece for China Daily by Sri Lankan analyst Maya Majueran, which explored the positive
political influence an expanded BRICS can wield, touched upon this aspect. Washington and its Western
allies, Majueran wrote, have long imposed their own policies and values on other nations under pretext
of promoting and safeguarding democracy and human rights. “Worse, they have been bullying some
emerging market and developing economies, forcing them to take sides in disputes with countries that
don&#39;t adhere to the Western-centric ideology and policies.”
These double standards, the analyst pointed out, were starkly evident from the contrast between US
support for Israeli aggression and the pressure Washington put on Global South nations to condemn
Russia’s actions in Ukraine. The BRICS, so far, appear to be focused on bringing about a ‘fairer’ world
order for the Global South, Majueran argued. “The Global South wants to improve the existing world
order because it is unfair and Western-centric,” he wrote.
Global economic overhaul
One tool the United States has frequently used to keep global governments in line with its geopolitical
and geoeconomic aims has been its currency. The US dollar, the Sri Lankan analyst wrote, has allowed
Washington to perpetuate its hegemony. The sanctions and trade restrictions the US placed on nearly
40 countries that run counter to American objectives have resulted in immense hardships for nearly half
of the world’s population.
BRICS discussions to bring about an alternative currency for global trade transactions could result in
potent counter to what Majueran termed the ‘weaponisation of the US dollar’. “If BRICS&#39; plan to adopt a
common currency to conduct global trade is successful… it could break the dollar&#39;s global hegemony and
make it easy for emerging economies to conduct free trade in currencies other than the dollar,” he
suggested.
In an interview with Sputnik a few days after Iran formally joined BRICS, the country’s deputy foreign
minister voiced interest in an alternative to the dollar. “We are interested in creating a unified currency
in the BRICS group, and this could be very effective,” Mahdi Safari said. “By using national currencies,
the process of eliminating the use of the dollar in commercial exchanges begins, and we are interested
in continuing this process,” he added.
BRICS members Russia and Iran have already officially abandoned the SWIFT payment system for cross-
border transactions. Instead, the two countries will initiate payments to settle international trade using
direct transfers between the banks of both countries.
An article carried by the UAE state-owned English-language daily The National anticipated more bilateral
trade in local currencies following the inclusion of new members into BRICS. “The implication we are
watching closely from the addition of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt to BRICS is the potential for more
bilateral trade in local currencies, particularly following the UAE and India&#39;s agreement reached in July,
and Egypt being in similar discussions with India already,” the article quoted Carla Slim, an economist at
Standard Chartered Bank, as saying. India has already started purchasing UAE oil in Indian rupees.
The article also expected that calls for overhauling the international monetary system and developing a
US dollar alternative would grow with BRICS expansion – “…even if less relevant today, the emergence
of BRICS common currency can act as a major harbinger in diversifying risks away from the stronghold of
the dollar,” it quoted Dubai-based professor of finance Ullas Rao as saying.
Infusion of finance
Up until last year, analysts, especially in Western publications, consistently downplayed the potential of
BRICS and emphasised how its five titular member nations, collectively, had failed to live up to economic
expectations. The formal inclusion of oil- and finance-rich Saudi Arabia and the UAE could allow the
grouping to challenge that perception and enable it to empower new economic initiatives, such as the
New Development Bank.
“The image of Brics in the past was of a financially vulnerable group, beholden to the global political
superpowers. The financial power of Saudi and the UAE as net exporters of capital to the rest of the
world will substantially change that perception,” the National quoted Gary Dugan, chief investment
officer at Dalma Capital, as saying. “Also as a collective, we expect Saudi Arabia and the UAE to be
afforded easier access to the growth markets of the BRICS countries on favourable terms,” he added.
An analysis by the Stimson Center last year explored in particular the impact the UAE could have as a
member of the BRICS, particularly on the NDB initiative, which has faced difficulties particularly due to
Western sanctions against Russia.
“The UAE could inject much-needed liquidity into the NDB,” the analysis noted, adding that the Gulf
nation’s substantial financial resources, including its sovereign wealth fund, could be leveraged to
provide direct capital contributions. “Moreover, the UAE’s expertise in finance and infrastructure
development could be valuable in structuring and managing NDB projects efficiently, attracting more
funding from both within and outside the BRICS alliance,” the analysis added.
Energy factor
With the inclusion of Saudi Arabia, Iran and the UAE, the BRICS grouping can now boast of being a major
player in the world’s energy market. China and India are already the second and third biggest consumers
of oil in the world with strong ties to Gulf countries. The two other new entrants, Egypt and Ethiopia,
also provide BRICS a firm foothold in one of the world’s major shipping corridors, from the Horn of
Africa to the Suez Canal.
Iran’s deputy foreign minister Safari, in his interview with Sputnik, highlighted the positive role the
expanded BRICS could play in terms of energy in particular. “The most important problem is represented
by three issues: the first is energy production, the second is energy transfer, and the third is energy
consumption. I can say that these three issues are being solved by BRICS.”
Experts quoted by the UAE-state-owned The National underscored the influence the expanded BRICS
now had on the world’s oil and energy markets. “The addition of two major oil exporters … will reinforce
their bargaining power and influence in OPEC+ while also offering the space for them to align their
strategies with other BRICS members,” it quoted commodities and emerging markets expert Ehsan
Khoman as saying. By virtue of its influence on OPEC+, the BRICS grouping is poised to become a
powerful voice for the Global South, Khoman added.
“The prospect of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iran and Egypt joining BRICS creates new mechanisms that
forces a degree of political co-operation by all the countries,” said Ayham Kamel, another expert quoted
in the article. “The Arab countries are looking for improving their global geopolitical influence and
appear committed to avoiding detachment from the West,” he stressed, however.
As the BRICS contain many members that overlap with the G20, they may work in tandem in the future,
a BBC article quoted Dr Irene Mia from the International Institute for Strategic Studies as saying.
&quot;Together, they might push for more money for developing nations to tackle climate change, or to
reduce the power of the US dollar as the world&#39;s currency,&quot; she said.
In the case of UAE in particular, the Stimson Center analysis noted that membership in the BRICS did in
no way mean a detachment from the West. “The UAE wants to maintain its strong ties with the US while
simultaneously exploring new avenues for collaboration and engagement with BRICS nations,” it stated.
“The UAE remains a vital US security partner in the Middle East. However, the Emirates appears to be
recalibrating its economic diplomacy to expand its political and economic leverage in the Global South.”
In a statement issued by the UAE following its formal inclusion into BRICS, the Gulf nations Minister of
State for International Cooperation, Her Excellency Reem Al Hashimy, said: “We are pleased to join the
BRICS group, which the UAE recognizes as a mechanism to promote global peace, stability, and
prosperity.”
“The UAE believes in championing multilateralism and actively contributing to important international
arenas. This includes engaging with BRICS, participating regularly in the G20 process, and hosting the
Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) climate
conference in November,” she concluded.
“The UAE stresses that the future of global security and prosperity relies on strong multilateral
partnerships and cooperation on the international level, and a shared commitment to achieving stability
and development.”

7,Mangla outflow dips to only 100 cusecs,Currently just 2.061 MAF of water available in dam,"The outflow of water from Mangla Dam -- the country's second-largest reservoir -- has dwindled to a mere 100 cusecs because of a sustained decline in the water level, primarily attributed to heavy snowfall in the upper reaches of the Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir on late Friday.
The dam has been consistently drying up, with inflows diminishing owing to the intermittent snowfall in the Himalayan belt and an unprecedented decrease in water flow in the rivers feeding into the reservoir.
The water level in the Mangla Dam, situated in Mirpur district of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), has experienced an alarming reduction, reaching 1,156.80 feet on Wednesday.
The current levels are below the maximum conservation level of 1,242 feet, indicating a live storage capacity of 2.061 million acre feet (MAF) in the reservoir, according to official sources on Friday.
The sources further said the water level in the dam was continuing to gradually decrease.
Due to the consistent influx of water throughout the current season, the water level in Mangla Dam reached 1,156.80 feet by Friday, following the discharge of 85.20 feet from the reservoir, the sources added.
Mangla Dam achieved its maximum conservation capacity of 1,242 feet on August 17 as part of the seasonal impounding of the reservoir.

8,Balochistan’s mud volcanoes never cease to amaze,They form islands with rapid release of methane gas,"Around 70 active mud volcanoes -- scattered from Lasbela to Gwadar in Balochistan at the bottom of the ocean’s rugged floor, exhibit continuous activity during sea floods, monsoon seasons, and various other weather conditions.
Simultaneously, these mud volcanoes, normally in deep silence, sporadically transform into high and explosive islands with the rapid release of methane gas because of the increase in underground pressure.
These islands, emerging suddenly from the depths of the ocean, leave observers in awe before eventually dissolving into the sea over time.
Over the past 68 years, four such islands have appeared and disappeared at different locations in Balochistan.
Unlike conventional volcanoes, active mud volcanoes do not contain lava; instead, they expel glutinous bubbling brown slurry of mineral-rich water and sediment.
When exposed to heat, they immediately catch fire due to the abundance of methane gas.
According to a 2013 survey, Chandragup -- located in Hingol National Park in Balochistan -- is the largest mud volcano in Pakistan, standing at 330 feet tall and with a diameter of 49 feet.
Mud volcanoes, or mud domes, are landforms created by the eruption of mud, water, and gases.
According to experts, several geological processes contribute to the formation of mud volcanoes.
While they lack flames and lava, deliberate setting of fire in their vicinity causes rapid spread due to the high methane presence.
Mud volcanoes can range from one to two metres in height and width.  However, in many places, they can reach up to 800 metres in height and spread over 10 kilometres.
The material released from mud volcanoes contains methane gas, emitting minimal carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas, along with salts, acids, and various hydrocarbon compounds.
Dozens of mud volcanoes are present in Russia's Taman Peninsula and Crimea, Ukraine's Kerch Peninsula, and various Italian peninsulas, among other locations.
In Pakistan, the province of Balochistan boasts over 140 mud volcanoes, with around 70 actively demonstrating their presence.
Some are so aggressively modified that all the mud inside dissolves in the sea, forming regular mountains and islands.
The notable mud volcanoes in Balochistan include Chandragup and Khandewari.
While active mud volcanoes in less challenging areas are accessible by foot, reaching many of them can require adventurous endeavours.
Smaller mud volcanoes in coastal Balochistan in the west of Gwadar contrast with larger ones found in Lasbela district, Mount Hinglaj, Hingol National Park and other areas of the province.
Chandragup is the most renowned mud volcano, where Hindu pilgrims throw flower petals because of their religious beliefs.
Geologists associate mud volcanoes with petroleum deposits, tectonic subduction zones, and orogenic belts.
Between 1945 and 2013, four islands appeared in Balochistan, disappearing within six months to a year because of decreasing underground pressure and the impact of ocean waves.
One notable event was the emergence of Zalzala Koh, a 17-foot-high and 250-foot-wide island, after an earthquake in Gwadar.
It continued emitting methane gas and erupted into flames when locals set fire to it.
In 2010, an island appeared in Kund Malir, 40 kilometres from Karachi, but vanished after two months.
Moazzam Ali Khan, technical adviser of WWF-Pakistan, explained that mud volcanoes stretched from Lasbela to Sonmiani in Balochistan and further on into Iran.
These mud volcanoes are susceptible to the effects of climate, supermoons, rising temperatures in summer, monsoon rains, and tidal surges.
In 1983, during a research expedition in Balochistan, a team ignited a fire in a high-altitude narrow-rim mud volcano, indicating significant methane gas presence.
According to Amir Haider Laghari, the director of the National Seismic Centre in Karachi, public awareness is crucial, especially among those engaging in fishing or recreational activities near these areas.
He added that while no untoward incident had been reported, caution was essential because of these islands’ high susceptibility to fire.
Laghari highlighted the collaborative efforts of geological scientists from Iran, Oman, and India, emphasising the unpredictable nature of mud volcanoes and their close relation to tsunamis.
Islands formed by mud volcanoes cannot be predicted like earthquakes, primarily occurring in subduction zone areas spreading from Sonmiani to Iran in a 50-kilometre decline.
Research suggests that the existence of these islands is attributed to the presence of methane gas in the planet.

9,Another resolution seeks election delay,Lawmaker from former FATA demands postponing polls for three months," 
Another resolution has been submitted in the Senate, seeking a three-month postponement of the general elections scheduled for February 8 due to winter and security threats.
The resolution, presented by independent Senator Hilal-ur-Rehman from the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), argues that severe cold and snowfall in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) next month would impede residents from voting.
Senator Hilal-ur-Rehman highlights the challenges in running election campaigns, citing security concerns and the fear of terrorist attacks.  The resolution emphasizes that incidents of terrorism have created an atmosphere of fear and insecurity in the country.
He says the distribution of threatening pamphlets in the homes and election offices of candidates adds another worrisome dimension to the existing security issues.
Read SC moved against Senate's election postponement resolution
While acknowledging the constitutional responsibility of holding timely elections, the assembly emphasizes the state's responsibility for protecting the lives and property of the people. Senator Hilal-ur-Rehman urges the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to postpone the elections for three months.
Four resolutions regarding the upcoming elections have been presented in the Senate. Three of them call for a delay in the polls, while the fourth, submitted by the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), advocates for timely elections.
On January 5, the Senate passed a resolution, twice, to postpone the scheduled vote on February 8, citing harsh winter weather in K-P and Balochistan and the prevailing law and order situation.

The resolution received support from lawmakers across various political parties, including the PPP, PTI, PML-Q, and BAP, as well as independent senators and those representing the former FATA.
However, PML-N Senator Afnanullah vehemently opposed the resolution, citing historical instances where elections proceeded even during challenging times, such as World War II and periods of terrorism in 2008, 2013, and 2018.
The unexpected development cast a shadow over the previously settled February 8 election date, established following discussions between the ECP and President Dr Arif Alvi.
On January 6, JI’s Mushtaq Ahmed Khan formally submitted an application to the Supreme Court, urging a thorough examination of the constitutional validity of the Senate's resolution and initiation of contempt proceedings against those seeking an election delay.
