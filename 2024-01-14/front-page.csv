• Ruling reads ‘not even prima facie evidence’ produced to show intra-party polls were held
• ECP had to extend deadline for allotment of symbols several times due to delay in verdict
ISLAMABAD: In a late-night decision after holding a marathon hearing, the Supreme Court on Saturday upheld the Dec 22 decision of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) depriving the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) of its iconic poll symbol — ‘bat’.
The decision was announced minutes before the expiry of the fifth extended deadline by the election watchdog for the intending candidates for the submission of party tickets. The three-member bench consisting of Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, and Justice Musarrat Hilali anno­unced the judgement at 11:15pm, after a delay of several hours.
“Democracy founded Pakistan, a fundamental aspect of which is the ability to put oneself forward as a candidate and to be able to vote, both within a political party and in general elections. Anything less would give rise to authoritarianism which may lead to dictatorship,” observed the CJP.

The hearing commenced at 10:00am on Saturday — a day when the court has never assembled to hear cases. The bench, which had taken up an appeal by the ECP challenging the Peshawar High Court (PHC) decision regarding the restoration of the PTI’s election symbol, took multiple breaks during the hearing.
The protracted hearing also affected the duties of the ECP staffers. Not only were they present in the courtroom at the time of the verdict, but they also had to extend their deadlines several times due to a delay in the court order. First, it was extended from 4:00pm then 7:00pm, then 10:00pm, later 11:00pm, and finally to 11:30pm.
The judgement also explained that ECP was a constitutional body and amongst its duties are those mentioned in the Constitution, Article 219(e), which stipulates that ECP must also undertake such functions as prescribed by law, which would include those mentioned in the act.
According to the court, the ECP did not act in a mala fide manner nor was the PTI discriminated against in the present case.
“It transpired that ECP had passed orders against 13 other registered political parties which were far more severe than the order passed against PTI; one such case, of All Pakistan Muslim League, came before this court on Jan 12, 2024, and the order of the ECP, delisting the said political party, was upheld,” said the ruling. According to the court, the mere production of a certificate stating that intra-party elections were held would not suffice to establish that the elections had been held when a challenge was thrown to such an assertion.
“Nor, in our opinion, should the ECP concern itself with minor irregularities in the holding of a political party’s elections. However, in the instant case not even prima facie evidence was produced to show that a semblance of elections had been held,” said the judgement.
The order said, “14 PTI members, with stated credentials, had complained to ECP that elections had not been held. These complaints were brushed aside in the writ petition by simply asserting that they were not members of PTI…but this bare denial was insufficient… And, if any member of a political party is expelled it must be done by Section 205 of the Act, but no evidence in this regard was forthcoming.”
“Section 208 of the Elections Act 2017 mandates that political parties must hold intra-party elections periodically…every member of a political party be provided with an equal opportunity…,” the judgement said, regretting that these aforementioned members were not provided with nomination papers when they went to get them.
“Incidentally, the notice issued by the PTI secretariat stated that the elections were to be held in Peshawar but did not mention the venue and then the venue was shifted to Chamkani, which is a village adjacent to Peshawar,” the judgement regretted.
“Neither before the Lahore High Court nor before the Peshawar High Court any provision of the [Elections] Act, including Section 215(5), was challenged,” the judgement recalled, adding that observation of the judges that the provision of the law was “absurd” was uncalled for, particularly when no provision thereof was declared to be unconstitutional.
“If it had been established that elections had been held then the ECP would have to justify if any legal benefit to such a political party was being withheld, but if intra-party polls were not held, the benefits accruing pursuant to the holding of elections could not be claimed,” the verdict said.
The Supreme Court did not agree that ECP did not have “any jurisdiction to question or adjudicate” such elections. “If such an interpretation is accepted it would render all provisions in the Elections Act requiring the holding of intra-party elections illusory and of no consequence and be redundant.”
Faisal Siddiqui, a senior lawyer at the Supreme Court, criticised the decision. “This decision in the ‘PTI bat symbol case’ will join the ranks of the notorious ‘Maulvi Tamizuddin case’ as a decision which, by hiding behind the smokescreen of legal technicalities, has fatally damaged democratic constitutionalism,” he said, linking the court order with that of ‘political engineering’ in 2018 polls.
‘Marathon hearing’
Earlier, PTI lawyer Hamid Khan, while concluding his arguments, cited Article 2A of the Constitution and highlighted that depriving the PTI from participating in the elections would “virtually mean depriving millions of voters” of their fundamental rights.
“This is a fundamental principle of jurisprudence that courts while interpreting constitutional provisions never ignore political consequences of its decision which may come back to haunt for years,” the counsel said.
“Such decision has the potential of adversely affecting the future of the country too since the assemblies elected from such elections will have no complete representation of the political parties and will leave any future government to be described as not legitimate,” said the PTI lawyer, while highlighting the consequences of the ECP’s decision to deny the PTI its electoral symbol.
Citing different judgements, the counsel contended that Article 17 of the Constitution always prevails, adding that on mere technicalities the parties should not be sent out of the election arena.
During the hearing, PTI counsel Ali Zafar argued that the ECP had made the former ruling party dysfunctional by taking away the election symbol.
The court also heard different complainants, including Akbar S. Babar and others, who apprised the bench that they were the ‘original members’ of the party and that they were denied the chance to contest intra-party polls.

1,Five soldiers martyred in Kech bomb explosion,Security forces vehicle hit by roadside bomb while returning to Gillisar checkpoint after patrolling; 4 militants killed in KP operations.,"GWADAR / QUETTA / PESHAWAR: Five soldiers were martyred and two others, including an officer, injured after an improvised explosive device (IED) blast targeted a security vehicle in the Buleda area of Balochistan’s Kech district on Saturday.
Separately, security forces killed four militants in two intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan and Dera Ismail Khan districts.
In the Kech incident, the security forces vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb while returning to the Gillisar checkpoint after patrolling.
Makran Commissioner Saeed Ahmed Umrani confirmed the details of the attack. “An improvised explosive device planted by the roadside was detonated when the vehicle of the security personnel was passing through the area,” he told Dawn by phone.

Four militants killed in North Waziristan, D.I. Khan operations

The martyred personnel were identified as Lance Naik Tariq Ali, and sepoys Tipu Razzaq, Shafiullah, Tariq Khan, and Sani Shaukat. The injured were Major Abbas and Lance Naik Mumtaz.
The bodies were shifted to the Turbat district hospital.
Following the blast, a brief exchange of fire also occurred with the attackers, who eventually fled the scene.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Ali Mardan Domki, Home Minister Mir Zubair Ahmed Jamali and Information Minister Jan Achakzai strongly condemned the incident and described it as a “cowardly terrorist attack”.
Mr Domki said in a statement that security officials were sacrificing their lives to safeguard the frontiers and protect the people’s lives and would continue to perform their duties despite such attacks.
He said security forces and citizens were on the same page in their struggle to root out terrorism from the country.
KP operations
Meanwhile, the first operation in KP took place in Mir Ali tehsil of North Waziristan, where an exchange of fire resulted in the death of two militants, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
These militants — identified as Commander Tabbasum alias Qadarman and Sajid alias Sarka­ndi — were engaged in numerous acts of terrorism, including attacks on security forces, the ISPR said.
In a separate joint operation by police and security forces in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, two more militants were eliminated.
Security forces recovered weapons, ammunition and explosives from the slain terrorists, who were involved in terrorist activities, extortion, and the target killings of civilians, the military said.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area. Locals of the area appreciated the operations and expressed their full support to eliminate the menace of terrorism,” the ISPR said.

2,Torkham trade halted as visa curbs placed on truckers,Sudden imposition of restrictions causes traffic congestion at border point on both sides.," 

VEHICLES loaded with export goods wait for clearance near the Torkham border crossing, on Saturday.—Dawn

KHYBER: Bilateral trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan temporarily came to a halt on Saturday as trucks loaded with import and export items became stranded on both sides of the border due to the imposition of visa restrictions on truck drivers by the Pakistan government.
Officials told transporters from both countries that they could not move to either side of the border without valid visas on their passports.
The sudden imposition of the restrictions caused traffic congestion at the border point on both sides, as the majority of drivers and their assistants could not present valid travel documents.
Ashna Mohammad, a truck driver, told Dawn that he was stuck in traffic despite having a visa sta­mped on his passport. How­ever, several drivers ahead of his vehicle did not have visas and were thus not allowed to cross the border.
Sabir Khan, a local customs clearing agent, told Dawn that with fruit imp­orts from Afghanistan com­ing to an end due to winter, the export of Pak­i­s­tani goods had incr­eased, leading to a traffic rush from the Pakistan side.
He mentioned that Afg­han border authorities had also stopped some Pak­is­tani drivers from entering Afghanistan after the sudden implementation of visa restrictions on Afghan dri­vers by the Pakistan government.
Mr Khan further stated that hundreds of trailers and containers loaded with Pakistani export goods, including cement, tractors, other agricultural tools, vegetables, oranges, and miscellaneous items, were stranded on the Pakistan side, causing hardships for the transporters.
It was also learnt that customs and security officials were in constant touch with high-ups in Islamabad for the early settlement of the visa issue for Afghan transporters.
Customs officials emphasised that with exports from Pakistan flowing at a high rate, they could not afford any delay in the customs clearance of goods already arrived at the Torkham border.
Representatives of local transporters demanded Pakistani authorities show leniency in the implementation of the visa policy and allow vehicles that have been cleared by customs authorities to proceed to Afghanistan.
They argued that these restrictions would not only result in financial losses but also negatively affect bilateral trade.
Local transporters are already troubled by the prolonged delay in the completion of the much-awaited customs terminal at Torkham by the National Logistics Cell.
Afghan border official Abdul Jabbar Hekmat, in a statement on Friday, said Torkham was closed to commercial truck drivers without visas from Pakis­tani authorities, AFP adds.

3,"PML-N senator, two former MPAs defect to Peoples Party","Senator Rana Mehmood to contest from NA-150 on PPP ticket; ex-lawmakers Rana Iqbal, Rana Tahir to compete for PP-220, PP-222.","• Senator Rana Mehmood to contest from NA-150 on PPP ticket
• Ex-lawmakers Rana Iqbal, Rana Tahir to compete for PP-220, PP-222
LAHORE / BAHAWALPUR: Three prominent PML-N leaders from Multan — a senator and two former MPAs — declared their allegiance to PPP on Saturday ahead of the next month’s elections.
The leaders who swit­ched sides include Sena­tor and former MNA Rana Mehmoodul Has­s­an, his brother Rana Shahidul Hassan, and former MPAs Rana Iqbal Siraj and Rana Tahir Shabbir.
The development — ann­ounced at a press conference in Multan, att­e­n­ded by PPP Cha­irman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari — marks a signi­ficant change in Multan’s political dynamics.
Mr Mehmood, who has had a long-standing association with PML-N and has twice secured a seat in the National Assembly in the 2002 and 2008 elections, will now contest the polls on the PPP’s ticket from the NA-150 constituency.
Rana Siraj and Rana Shabbir are set to contest the Punjab Assem­bly elections from PP-220 and PP-222, respectively, under the PPP banner.
This transition followed these leaders’ discussions with Mr Bhutto-Zardari, bolstering PPP’s ranks as it gears up for the upcoming electoral contest.
During the presser, Mr Bhutto-Zardari warmly welcomed the new members, emphasising PPP’s commitment to representing the entire country and specifically highlighting its long-standing ties with Multan.
He outlined the party’s ambitious 10-point ele­ction manifesto, whi­ch focuses on wage increases, free electricity, education, and healthcare development across the country.
The PPP chairman emphasised that the PPP was the only party that had been struggling for the people for three generations, and its purpose behind contesting the elections was not linked with evading prison or getting out of jail but to serve the people.
He announced visiting Multan again on Jan 26 for a public gathering.
He invited the people to attend and express their support for the new form of politics that the PPP aims to introduce, to end the traditional politics of hate and division.
Responding to questions, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the PPP’s sole desire was to be a laadla (blue-eyed) of the masses, as they were the source of power as per the teachings of PPP founder and former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari emphasised that he was leading the only political party in the country that was running its election campaign and placing absolute trust in the people.
Underlining PPP’s generational struggle, Mr Bhutto-Zardari differentiated his party’s ideology from others, stressing its focus on the needs of the common people, including farmers, labourers and journalists.
He criticised former premiers Imran Khan and Nawaz Sharif for allegedly prioritising their personal vendettas over the needs of the people and reiterated PPP’s commitment to free and fair elections.
He asserted that the PPP was not among those who vacated the pitch or could be intimidated. He said the elections would take place on Feb 8, as stated by the chief justice of Pakistan, and urged people not to be under any other impression.
‘Dynamic economic plan’
Earlier, speaking at an election rally at Bahawalpur’s Dring Stadium — a hockey ground where Benazir Bhutto also addressed a public meeting ahead of the 2008 elections — Mr Bhutto-Zardari described the Feb 8 elections as a death and life issue for his party and appealed people to vote for PPP.
He said the country had been facing challenges of price hikes, poverty and unemployment like in the past and claimed that PPP founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had brought the country out of a financial crisis in the 1970s.
He said the PPP once again had accepted the challenge to introduce a dynamic to fix economic issues.
Criticising his opponents, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said none of the political parties and their politicians had pain for the people’s problems like unemployment and poverty as “they only want the chair”.
He stressed that his party had no contest with any of the political parties and politicians, and it was only fighting unemployment and poverty in the country. He claimed that the PPP was the only party contesting elections to bring a real change to the lives of the poor people.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari announced various initiatives, including a poverty elimination programme, housing schemes, and youth-focused programmes like the youth card and stipends for the unemployed. He also promised to revamp the BISP and its linked programmes like Waseela Education and Waseela Rozgar.
He called on party workers to actively promote the PPP’s agenda and announced plans to establish an IT university and a cardiology hospital in Bahawalpur if elected to power.
He urged PPP workers to launch a door-to-door campaign to convey the party’s 10-point manifesto to the people.
The public gathering was also attended by former Punjab governor and PPP’s south Punjab President Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood, PPP leader Zafar Waraich, PPP candidate for NA-168 Bahawalpur Hafiz Hussain Ahmad Madni and other leaders.

4,Never allowed to decide party tickets: Imran,"In interaction with media after Toshakhana hearing, former premier accuses Nawaz Sharif of playing the match ""with the umpires of choice""."," 

PESHAWAR: PTI activists protest against ‘unfair’ distribution of tickets for the elections.—Shahbaz Butt / White Star

ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan has said that despite court orders he was never allowed in jail to hold meeting with PTI leaders on the distribution of tickets to party candidates for the upcoming elections and accused PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif of playing the match “with the umpires of choice”.
The PTI founder expressed these views while interacting with the media after attending court proceedings in the Toshakhana case on Saturday.
He said that a certified money launderer returned to Pakistan under the London Plan and was given a safe passage as the courts allegedly appeared to be lenient with his opponents.
Before the court proceedings began, about two dozen PTI workers and candidates of different constituencies complained to Mr Khan about being denied party tickets. He told them that the tickets were awarded with his little input and that he was unaware of their distribution. He explained to them that it was not possible for him to make a quick decision on the award of 850 tickets in a brief discussion with party leaders.

Only issue for any talks with relevant quarters is free, fair election, says former premier

In response to a question if he was ready to hold dialogue with the certain quarters, the former premier replied that he had been given the option for a dialogue 18 months ago, but he had no idea of holding talks “with whom” and “for what”.
“The only issue left for discussion is conducting free and fair elections,” he added.
He expressed concerns over the resignation of two senior judges of the Supreme Court.
 
 

He believed all attempts being made against PTI’s election symbol of “bat” were aimed at debilitating the party before elections, but it will fight till the last ball no matter what happens.
Asked if PTI would support Sheikh Rashid in the elections, Mr Khan said the party had made a decision of not accommodating those who held a press conference to condemn the leadership.
Responding to a question as to why he always blamed former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa but not former spymaster Faiz Hameed, Mr Khan said: “Orders in the army comes from the top.”
Referring to the 2018 elections that his party had won, he said the PTI was also a victim of a sudden collapse of Result Transmission System (RTS) then, as it could not secure the seats required to form a stable government. The PTI lost 15 seats with a margin of less than 3,000 votes in 2018 elections, he added.
 
 

Regarding the article recently published in The Economist, Mr Khan said he had verbally dictated that article to his lawyers and asked them to get more information from his previously recorded interviews.
Sources said the jail administration had intercepted some hand-written notes of Mr Khan that his lawyers were taking out from jail premises but then he took those back. The same were later produced before the judge, who asked lawyers to remove Mr Khan’s signatures from the pages before returning those to them.
During the Toshakhana case proceedings, Judge Mohammad Bashir of the accountability court recorded the statement of four witnesses.
Eight witnesses have testified before the court so far. Further proceeding in this matter has been adjourned till January 15.

5,"US hits Houthi target in Yemen, again","Unfazed by attacks, Houthi forces vow more strikes; Russia condemns ‘blatant armed aggression’ against entire Yemeni population.","


 
• Unfazed by attacks, Houthi forces vow more strikes
• Russia condemns ‘blatant armed aggression’ against entire Yemeni population
SANAA: The United States carried out a fresh strike on Saturday on a Houthi target in Yemen, the US military said, after the Iran-backed fighters warned of further attacks on ships in the Red Sea.
The strike on a Houthi radar site came a day after US and British forces hit scores of targets across the country, heightening fears that the Gaza crisis could engulf the wider region.
The Houthis, who say they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza, have carried out a growing number of missile and drone attacks in the key Red Sea international trade route. They say they are targeting Israeli-linked shipping.
Around 12 per cent of global trade normally passes through the Bab Al Mandeb Strait, the Red Sea entrance between south-western Yemen and Djibouti.
But since mid-November the Houthi attacks have affected trade flows when supply strains are already putting upward pressure on inflation globally.
US Central Command said Saturday’s strike was “a follow-up action on a specific military target” related to the previous day’s strikes.
The Houthis’ official media earlier said Al Dailami airbase in Sanaa had been struck in the latest bombardment.
Britain, the United States and eight allies said strikes on Friday aimed to “de-escalate tensions”, but the Houthis vow­ed to continue their attacks.
Analysts said the Western strikes were unlikely to stop them. They will “diminish but not end the Houthi threat to shipping,” said Jon Alterman, a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
The Houthis withstood thousands of air strikes while battling a Saudi-led coalition for more than seven years. They earlier fought six wars against Yemen’s government between 2004 and 2010.
“All American-British interests have become legitimate targets” following the strikes, the Houthis’ Supreme Political Council said in a statement.
Hussein al Ezzi, the Houthis’ `deputy foreign minister’, said the United States and Britain would “have to prepare to pay a heavy price”.
The Houthis have controlled much of Yemen since a civil war erupted in 2014 and are part of an Iran-aligned “axis of resistance” against Israel and its allies.
United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres called on all sides “not to escalate” in the interest of regional peace and stability, his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
Regional concern
The United Nations Secu­rity Council held an emergency meeting on the strikes on Friday, days after adopting a resolution demanding the Houthis immediately stop their attacks on ships.
At the meeting, US Ambas­sador Linda Thomas-Green­field warned that no ship was safe from the Houthi threat in the Red Sea.
Russian Ambassador Vas­sili Nebenzia denounced the “blatant armed aggression” against the entire population of Yemen.
Washington last month ann­ounced a maritime security initiative, Operation Pros­p­e­rity Guar­dian, to protect maritime traffic in the area, but the Houthis kept up attacks despite several warnings.
With the strikes on Friday, the United States and Britain targeted nearly 30 locations using more than 150 munitions, US General Douglas Sims said, updating earlier figures.
The Houthis fired “at least one” anti-ship ballistic missile in retaliation, but it caused no damage, according to Sims. President Joe Biden said he did not believe there were civilian casualties.
Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said the raids “led to the death of five martyrs” and wounded six fighters.
Biden called the strikes a successful “defensive action” after the “unprecedented” Red Sea attacks and said he would act again if the Houthis continued their “outrageous behaviour”.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the Houthis’ breach of international law warranted the “strong signal”, which he described as “proportionate”.
But Nasser Kanani, spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, said the Western strikes wou­ld fuel “insecurity and ins­ta­bility in the region” while “diverting” attention from Gaza.
Washington said it did not seek conflict with Tehran, and National Security Council spo­k­esman John Kirby told MSNBC there was “no reason” for an escalation.
Middle Eastern leaders voiced concern, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan describing the strikes on Yemen as disproportionate and saying: “It is as if they aspire to turn the Red Sea into a bloodbath.”
Saudi Arabia said it “is following with great concern the military operations” and called for “self-restraint and avoiding escalation”.
Riyadh is trying to extricate itself from its nine-year war with the Houthis, though fighting has largely been on hold since a truce in early 2022.
Hundreds of thousands of people, some carrying Kalashnikov assault rifles, gathered in Yemen’s capital Sanaa on Friday to protest, many waving Yemeni and Palestinian flags.
“Death to America, death to Israel”, they chanted.
In Tehran, hundreds rallied against the United States, Britain and Israel, burning the three countries’ flags outside the UK embassy while voicing support for Gazans and Yemenis. In Gaza City, some Palestinians lauded Houthi support and condemned Britain and the United States.
