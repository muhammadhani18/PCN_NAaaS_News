3,‘Mutual accords crucial for climate talks’,Experts say commitment to transition away from fossil fuels is welcome decision,"While there is a lot of talk and criticism about COP28, SDPI Executive Director, Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri has said that there is no good or bad COP for climate; what is important is applying the Win-Win mindset which is crucial for effective climate change negotiations.
He was speaking at seminar titled “SDPI’s Response To COP28: From Consensus To Realisation” organised by SDPI the other day.
Dr Suleri said that the commitment to transition away from fossil fuels is a yet welcome decision and hoped that the government of Azerbaijan will follow the footsteps of UAE government in the next COP and will continue to build this momentum on fossil fuel transition ultimately leading to fossil fuel phase out. He said that this decision will open new avenues for investment, technology development, global stock take and greater global cooperation.
He said that world governments mobilised US$30 Trillion to combat COVID19; same spirit is needed to combat the climate pandemic too. Following individual personal interests might enable countries to become climate smart but will not last long and only Win-Win approach can be effective in the long-run.
Ambassador of Azerbaijan to Pakistan, Khazar Farhadov, addressing the session said that climate action cannot move forward without economic development which underlines key role of private sector in driving economic growth. This calls for the governments to develop policies in consultation with the private sector.

Shedding light on the impact of conflicts on the environment, he said that Azerbaijan aims for a clean environment realising the grave environmental impact of conflicts experienced by Azerbaijan. He said the government of Azerbaijan has termed 2024 “Green World Solidarity Year” and plans to increase the share of renewable energy by 30% and inhibit greenhouse gas inhibition to 35% by 2040 and 40% by 2050.
He stressed that the country is ambitious to deliver on its national climate commitments and aims to strengthen multi-lateral partnerships and global cooperation which is also evident from the plans to export 4GW of renewable energy to Europe through Black Sea.
Ambassador Shafqat Kakakhel, Chairperson of BOG SDPI, said that COP28 succeeded in operationalising Loss and Damage Fund, and a total of US$800 million was pledged by countries as the baseline.
COP28 also recognised that global community had not delivered in any area including mitigation, adaptation, adoption of science and technology, and weak partnerships but the decision to transition away from fossil fuels is a big success. He stressed that COP-29 will have to deal with new quantified financial goals and must use the US$100 billion as the baseline and the ceiling must be escalated with more financial assistance flowing from developed to developing countries for effective and sustainable climate action.

IHC Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri ordered the issuance of show-cause notices to Chairman Captain (retd) Anwarul Haq, Director State Tabinda Sadiq and Member State Tariq Salam during the hearing of a contempt of court petition filed by Nizamul Haque Siddiqui.

The petitioner, Nizamul Haque, had purchased a plot for an automobile workshop in Sector I-10/3 of the federal capital, which was transferred to the name of the petitioner on June 6, 2013. When he applied to get possession of his plot, he was told that the plot could not be given to him as the plot in question was situated in a graveyard with two graves existing on it.
When the citizen applied for an alternative plot, the matter was handed over to a committee, which was unable to decide for a long time. CDA officials told the court that the process of allotting alternative plots was delayed due to the member planning post’s vacancy.
The CDA’s lawyer assured that the petitioner would be allotted the plot within 30 days, however, his assurance did not hold as instead of getting the court directives implemented, the CDA member state got the department’s counsel delisted from its panel.

8,Pindi embraces tech to curb phone snatching,"Shopkeepers, technicians to install ‘e-gadget software’ to track stolen devices","In response to a surge in mobile phone theft in Rawalpindi, a new system is being implemented to track mobile phone snatchers, which will work by keeping a record of all phones sold through the ‘e-gadget software’.
Under the precautionary plan, mobile store shopkeepers and technicians have been instructed by police to install the record-keeping software and update all mobile purchases, including their sale and repair orders onto the system.
The development comes after a notable increase in mobile phone theft cases in Rawalpindi. It is reported that each day, 20 to 25 phones are stolen or snatched.
The system will help prevent incidents of mobile phone snatching and theft, which includes the resale of stolen mobile phones. Once, shopkeepers download the software, they will make an entry into the system each time they sell a mobile phone or each time a phone is submitted for repair. 
The record-keeping will ensure that owners of mobile phones are traceable through the system. This will be helpful in investigating phone snatchers if they bring stolen phones for sale or repair to a store.

The mobile phone dealers and technicians have also been obliged to keep a complete record of those, who came to the market for sale, purchase and repair of mobile phones and in order to make the monitoring more strict, CPO Rawalpindi Khalid Hamdani created regular SOPs and assigned the task to the Rawalpindi Police at the police station level to oblige all the mobile phone dealers and technicians in their respective areas to download the e-gadget software of the Punjab Police and oblige them to update the entries in the software whenever they buy, sell or repair the mobile phones of those, who came to the market and those who do not do so, after verification, legal action should be taken against them.
Although Rawalpindi CPO Khalid Hamdani issued orders to divisional SPs to implement the plan, a review revealed that only 43 entries had been made into the software. This is in spite of the fact that there are 4500 mobile phone stores registered in Rawalpindi and that both sale of phones and snatching cases are on the rise.
Multiple letters ordering a review of the plan’s progress have been issued since October 2023 to December 2023. The letters explained that the e-gadget software standard of procedures have been compiled and repeated instructions have been issued to check whether mobile phone vendors and mobile shops have installed the e-gadget application.
Legal action has been ordered against vendors and shop owners who have not yet installed the application and are not following orders to promptly update the system with required details.
