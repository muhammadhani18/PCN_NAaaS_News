0,Sumaira’s husband to contest election,"SARGODHA: Malik Tahir Sarfraz Awan, the former bureaucrat, husband of former MNA Sumaira Malik and a nephew of ...","SARGODHA: Malik Tahir Sarfraz Awan, the former bureaucrat, husband of former MNA Sumaira Malik and a nephew of former MNA Malik Muhammad Naeem Awan, has announced to contest the election from NA-87 Khushab as an independent candidate. 
According to political analysts, Tahir’s decision to contest the election had given a new life to his group as Sumaira had withdrawn her decision to contest the election. However, she appealed to her voters to vote against PML-N nominee Malik Shakir Bashir Awan and Malik Asif Bha, a nominee of the party from PP-81. 
It will be not out of place to mention that in the 2018 election, Umar Aslam Awan, the nominee of the PTI, had given a tough time to Malik Shakir Bashir Awan; however, his younger brother Malik Hassan Aslam, a nominee of the PTI, had defeated the PML-N nominee.  
Though Sumaira’s husband is in the field as an independent against his cousin Malik Umar Aslam of the PTI nominee, but internally they favour Malik Umar to give a message to the PML-N that they have influence in the area.

1,The question of Muslim nationalism and an Urdu novel,LAHORE: Historian Ali Usman Qasmi says there were various shades of the Muslim nationhood in the initial years of...,"LAHORE: Historian Ali Usman Qasmi says there were various shades of the Muslim nationhood in the initial years of Pakistan’s history as it had both its supporters as well as opponents. He said by writing his new book, he wanted to explore why a Muslim nationhood collapsed or faced a crisis as soon as it turned into state while other nationalisms like Sindhi, Baloch or Pashtun thrived. 
He was speaking at the launch of his book, Qaum, Mulk, Saltanat: Citizenship and National Belonging in Pakistan, at the Afkar-i-Taza ThinkFest. The session was moderated by Raza Rumi. 
“My focus has been the decade of the 1950s when the debate was strong and the people were involved in debates in the newspapers as well as in the assembly. Though there was dominance of the Muslim League, there was a sizeable opposition, especially from Bengal”. 
Qasmi said the concept of Islamic state was different to different people just like the idea of Islamic nationhood. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman raised the issue of contours of an Islamic state in the constituent assembly and that it meant taking away the majority status of Bengal. There was a debate on the necessity of declaring Pakistan as an Islamic state, he said and added that Mujib had warned that if Pakistan was declared as an Islamic state, the RSS would also make a similar demand in India in the future.  
Qasmi said the bureaucrats were discussing the shade of the green colour of the national flag and they found out that the colour of the flag raised by Quaid-i-Azam had faded. 
To the question of the national anthem, he said Z.A. Bokhari thought there should not be a national anthem as it was un-Islamic and if it was a must, then it should be Surah Fateha.  
“When Hafiz Jullundhri was approached by Liaqat Ali Khan first, he wrote a different anthem and he was against the composition, considering it the music of mourning on deaths.” He said the original national anthem was more pro-people. 
OSAMA SIDDIQUE: Novelist Osama Siddique was joined by Amna Mufti and Faisal Bari on the launch of his debut Urdu novel, Gharoob-i-Shehr Ka Waqt. 
He said he wanted to write something that he thought could be better communicated in fiction so he wrote his first Urdu novel. He said he started writing his novel in English language initially but did not enjoy it and thought about writing the story of the city in the language that’s spoken by its citizens. 
While introducing his book, Dr Osama revealed, “I began writing it in English, but a foreign language couldn’t do justice to the story. Perhaps the English medium is not good enough to express Lahore and Lahoris”. 
Osama took on the issue of language of fiction, saying while writing English he knew that he could not write in the language of Dickens and Hardy and added that even in English writing, the Indian writers writing in the language had their own idiom. He criticised the conservative establishment of Urdu literature who thought that a particular Lakhnavi expression was required for writing. He said he used to recite poetry of Majeed Amjad aloud daily to get inspiration for writing his novel or to have the same impact of the language in his own writing.

2,Five Kotla siblings manage to get tickets from three parties,GUJRAT: At least five siblings from Kotla family have been nominated as candidates from three political parties -...,"GUJRAT: At least five siblings from Kotla family have been nominated as candidates from three political parties - PML-N, PML-Q and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf. 
Three of the brothers are up against each other from the same constituency - PP 28 (Kotla) - in the Feb 8 polls. 
A faction of Kotla group, being led by ex-MNA Abid Raza, has been awarded the PML-N tickets from three constituencies. Tanveer Kotla, a former Gujrat district council chairman, has been nominated from PP-33 (Lalamusa), ex-MPA Shabeer Kotla is a party nominee from PP-28 and Abid Raza is contesting from NA-62 (Sara-I-Alamgir-Kharian-Kotla) for the third consecutive time. 
This is for the first time in the history of Gujrat district that three brothers had been given tickets of the same party. 
Similarly, Naeem Raza Kotla, a former adviser to the Punjab chief minister, has been contesting from PP-28 on a PML-Q ticket whereas his younger brother Shahid Raza, a former Kotla union council chairman, managed to get PTI ticket from the same constituency where another brother Shabeer Kotla is a PML-N nominee. 
PML-N’s Shabeer Kotla had defeated his elder brother Naeem Raza of the PML-Q in the 2013 general elections and now three brothers are contesting to win that seat. 
The other two siblings, who are contesting from constituencies of Gujrat, belong to the Chaudhrys of PML-Q as Salik Hussain and his brother Shafay Hussain, sons of PML-Q chief Shujaat Hussain, are in the race from NA-64 (Gujrat-Kunjah) and its both PA seats - PP 31 and 32. Hussain Elahi and Musa Elahi, scions of Wajahat Hussain, are contesting from NA-63 and NA-62, respectively. 
Two members of Nawabzada family - ex-MNA Ghazanfar Ali Gul and ex-MPA Haider Mehdi - are vying for NA-63 (Jalalpur Jattan-Tanda) and PP-29 (Tanda) on the PML-N platform. 
The two members of Kaira family - PPP stalwart Qamar Zaman Kaira and his cousin Nadeem Asghar Kaira - are contestants from NA-65 (Lalamusa-Dinga) and PP-33 (Lalamusa) on the tickets of PPP. 
Meanwhile, the PML-N senior leadership has contacted former state minister Jaafar Iqbal, who had been denied the ticket from NA-65 where the party fielded Naseer Abbas Sidh, the brother of Chief of Air Staff Zaheerudin Baber Sidh. 
It is learnt that Shahbaz Sharif made s phone call to Mr Iqbal, taking him into confidence over the circumstances for not awarding ticket to him. 
In a statement issued here on Saturday, Mr Iqbal announced to be loyal to the party by accepting the decision. 
He said he would never make any request to accommodate or reward him in response to his acceptance of party decision. 
Sources said until Friday night, the reports of Jaafar’s becoming a PML-Q candidate for NA-65 were rife.

3,Fakhar Pagganwala quits race for PP-31,GUJRAT: As a twist in the story of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) nomination of candidates against the scions of...,"GUJRAT: As a twist in the story of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) nomination of candidates against the scions of PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, the party leadership has finally directed Mian Fakhar Mushtaq Pagganwala to withdraw his nomination papers from PP-31, Gujrat city. 
However, the party candidates from NA-64, Gujrat-Kunjah, and PP-32, Kunjah, Mubeen Arshad and Azfar Badar Warraich, respectively, are still in the race.  
Fakhar Pagganwala told Dawn he had received a telephone call from 
co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari again on Saturday and the latter had directed him to withdraw from the race for PP-31 in favour of PML-Q nominee Chaudhry Shafay Hussain. He said following the direction by the party’s senior most leader, he had decided to quit the race. 
The scion of a party old guard and former PPP MNA Mian Mushtaq Pagganwala, Fakhar Pagganwala said he had also been contacted by former federal minister Chaudhry Salik Hussain in the light of the contact between the senior leadership of both the parties. 
“I have planned to convene a meeting of local party workers as well as the well wishers and supporters of the Pagganwala family in the next few days to take them into confidence on the directions by the party leadership,” said Pagganwala. 
It is learnt that PPP central Punjab President and National Assembly former speaker Raja Parvez Ashraf also talked to Fakhar Pagganwala on the matter of his withdrawal from the election race. 
Sources said the PML-Q had only demanded the PPP to convince Pagganwala to withdraw from the race and did not press for the withdrawal of parties’ other nominees from NA-64 and PP-32 where Salik Hussain is a party candidate. 
Salik Hussain and his elder brother, Shafay Hussain, are likely to visit the Pagganwala House in the coming days. 
A few days earlier Mr Zardari had directed Fakhar Pagganwala to contest the election and the PPP ticket was also handed over to him for PP-31 on Friday. 
The Pagganwala family of the PPP had once been the staunch rival of the Chaudhrys of the PML-Q in Gujrat as Mushtaq Pagganwala had won against Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi in 1977 whereas PML-Q chief Shujaat Hussain had won against Mr Pagganwala in 1988 polls.

4,Consumers cry with rage over recent gas bills in Lahore,"People baffled by ""fixed charges"" which are not fixed at all.","LAHORE: Consumers at large have rejected the new gas tariff amid fixed charges terming it unjustified and illogical keeping in view the deteriorating financial situation being faced by commoners.  
Criticising the government for not taking effective steps to ease life of the public at large, they have sought immediate withdrawal of the hike in gas prices. 
“Since we were already under immense financial stress due to massive increase in the power tariff, sky-rocketing prices of commodities etc, the recent hike in gas tariff with effect from Nov 1 has crushed us completely. If you see my bill, you will get baffled,” deplores a consumer, a resident of Gulshan-i-Ravi, while talking to Dawn on Saturday.  
When asked about the bill, he said, the bill for the month of December 2022 he had paid was of Rs2,910. But the bill for December he received recently has broken all records, as it is of Rs12,320 that includes Rs2,000 fixed charges besides increase in the tariff. This all also left an increasing impact on general sales tax which amounts to Rs1,878. 

People baffled by ‘fixed charges’ which are not fixed at all

Talking to Dawn, another consumer narrated the same ordeal, stating that he also received bill of Rs3,600 that included Rs1,000 fixed charges. “It is really strange that when the tariff has been increased why the fixed charges have been imposed additionally,” he argued, requesting the prime minister, petroleum division secretary and Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority to intervene into the matter and give some relief to the consumers rather than making their life harder. “I also request the chief justice of Pakistan to take suo motu notice in this regard,” he appealed. 
Criticising the government, another consumer also complained about inflated bills amid imposition of fixed charges. “It seems that the government has decided to fleece the consumers through tariff increase, fixed charges etc. But who cares for the common people since the elite is involved in electioneering now,” he lamented.  
On the other hand, an official source in the respective ministry termed massive raise in tariff and imposition of fixed charges a result of not increasing tariff for the last 10 years by the successive political governments.  
“It is unjustified, as the governments should have taken decisions boldly by rationalising and increasing the tariff annually rather than piling up the annual increase and putting the entire financial load on the shoulders of consumers in one go. This is the issue in fact, which has forced the people to cry with rage,” he explained.  
He said he had heard about another hike in the gas prices soon to adhere to the IMF conditions. 
However, he claimed that a majority of consumers (60pc or so) have found a slight increase of Rs500 or so per month. These consumers, he called as “protected” ones. He said he himself received a heavy bill recently for December 2023. 
He said those using gas up to 0.25 (HM3), 0.60, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and above fall under slab 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and are being charged [as per new tariff with effect from Nov 1] Rs300, Rs600, Rs1,000, Rs1,200, Rs1,600, Rs3,000, Rs3,500 and Rs4,000, respectively. “And if the government increases tariff more in near future, the existing rates may be doubled,” he warned.

The PPP leadership did not award ticket to Lahore chapter president Aslam Gill for mere one reason -- focus on Mr Bhutto-Zardari campaign.  
“Though Mr Gill had secured over 33,000 votes from a Lahore constituency in 2021 bypoll but the party sacrificed him for Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s campaign,” a PPP leader from Punjab told Dawn on Saturday.
He said practically speaking the PPP was contesting from Lahore’s one NA seat and the rest were mere formalities. “Even the performance of the candidates of other constituencies of Lahore will be judged in terms of their contribution to run the campaign and secure votes for the party chairman,” he said and added not many of the PPP candidates were interested to spend money in their constituencies knowing the ground reality about their vote bank in the city. “Like, Mr Bhutto-Zardari, some other candidates of the party in the city are pinning hopes on the supporters of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) that might vote for PPP in case hurdles are created for its (PTI) candidates in the current prevailing political scenario,” he said and added the PTI supports would like to see the PML-N candidates defeated in Feb 8 polls.
Even Bhutto-Zardari has been making appeals to the PTI youth in his recent rallies, asking them not to waste their vote.
Bilawal only addressed events at NA1-27. He did not go to any other constituency of Lahore for his party candidate. During his visits, he mostly targeted the Sharif brothers asking the Lahorities to vote for him to make prime minister as three-time premier Nawaz Sharif had done nothing for them.
The PPP leadership has also tasked the People’s Youth Federation (PSF) to launch a comprehensive canvassing in NA-127. The PPP social media team has also launched activities in the constituency.
PPP NA-127 digital head Ayesha Chaudhry on Saturday launched an App to send messages to the voters of the constituency. In this constituency, Bilawal is competing against PML-N’s Attaullah Tarar and PTI’s Zahir Abbas Khokhar.

9,Who is supposed to run the country?,ThinkFest begins with the big question of army intervention in politics,"LAHORE: As the tempers are getting high while election fever rises in the country, the pertinent question has been raised about the interference of the army in politics in the inaugural session of the ThinkFest Afkar-e-Taza at the Alhamra Art Centre here on Saturday.
The session, titled ‘Reimagining Pakistan: Do we need a new social contract?,’ had former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former finance minister Miftah Ismail and Jugnu Mohsin.
Abbasi stressed the need for a new social contract and amendments to the 1973 Constitution. He supported the current constitution and the parliamentary system, saying that according to the basic constitution, Pakistan was not supposed to be a security state though it had become so with the passage of time as the security paradigm took over.
To the question of how to put the genie (army) back in the bottle, Abbasi said the deterioration had been a gradual process so the fix would also take time and it could not be done in one day. He said the first thing was to identify the issues and move forward in a collaborative way to fix them. He stressed the need for massive reforms in the country where the federal officers were working at tehsil level where they should not be.

ThinkFest begins with the big question of army intervention in politics

Miftah said that during his term as the finance minister, the issue had never been the army budget and he compared the $8bn defence budget of Pakistan with more than $64bn of India. “The issue is not that the army is spending money but the army’s interference in politics.”
To this, Jugnu replied that India was spending more money compared to us because India was making more money than us.
The former finance minister said the question that who was supposed to run the country had not been answered. “The issue is not the constitution but not following the constitution. There is a lot of mistrust between institutions and the provinces that don’t trust one another.”
He took on the behaviour of the politicians vis-à-vis the army’s interference in politics, saying that those (PTI) leaders who were against military’s involvement in politics today were very happy with the military’s involvement in politics from 2014 till 2018 and those (PML-N, PPP) who were lamenting army’s involvement in politics from 2014 to 2018 just have switched sides. “The politicians really live in a very myopic world and I think we need to have a leadership that thinks beyond one election”.
At the end, Jugnu taunted both the former PML-N leaders for avoiding the question regarding the army’s involvement in politics, implying that it was not an issue. To which, Abbasi replied that if the army always came when the politicians ditched the people and if the politicians improved their performance, the army won’t intervene.
Miftah reiterated that the central dilemma of Pakistan was the question that who would run the country, the people or the institutions. “It needs to be decided who would run the country and warned that “Chiragh sub kay bujhain gey hawa kisi ki nahi,” he said, indirectly referring to the current state of affairs.
Abbasi spoke about the ongoing ‘blame games’ in the country, emphasizing the need for leadership that would break the cycle. He underscored the importance of finding a balance between institutions and the constitution for effective governance.
When asked about how the party he was planning to form would be different from others regarding solution to issues and reimaging Pakistan, he said, “We know the issues and we know the fixes, spending 36 years in politics.”
Earlier, Dr Yaqoob Khan Bangash, the founder of ThinkFest, discussed the theme ‘Winter of Discontent’ and highlighted the importance of intellectual discourse in the country.

10,"Harking back: Of climate change, motorcycles and lethal smog","As the world genuinely feels threatened by climate change, it is a shame that Lahore is, probably, the world’s ...","As the world genuinely feels threatened by climate change, it is a shame that Lahore is, probably, the world’s most polluted city. Given this ancient city’s history this is a shame.
Research shows that motorcycles are more fuel-efficient than cars because they emit lesser greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. But then the fatal difference is they emit far more smog-forming hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen as well as the extreme toxic air pollutant carbon monoxide. Research shows that five cars equal the smog-forming emission of one motorcycle.
Let us examine the threat to smog from motorcycles to our city. But first be aware that smog forms most where motorcycles ply, plus cities near the sea with sea breeze as the saviour which blows the smog away. In cities far from the sea the smog just grows.
The Punjab Police computer records tell us that for the city of Lahore it has 4.2 million motorcycles for a population of 14.4 million. The average number of persons per house, call it household, is seven persons. This means that there are 2.06 motorcycles per household in Lahore. Given these official figures, it means every household has over two motorcycles each, with some areas almost three per household.
Why is this so? The reason is that our local government virtually does not exist, and they have completely failed to provide local transportation. The same is true of other Pakistani cities, including Karachi.
In 1947 when Partition took place, Mr. M.A. Jinnah among his first orders were for Lahore, and other cities, to have an efficient transport system for the poor. He assigned Mr Zulfiqar Taha to set up the LOS, and buses were assembled in Lahore. In our youth everyone used buses, or bicycles. Smog never existed.
In 1971 after the Bangladesh tragedy, the then prime minister ordered buses from Sweden for Lahore as the old LOS buses suffered from parts theft and disinterest, what to speak of other ills. Also, from the LOS coffers a massive loan was forced by an official institution which bankrupted the LOS. That loan was never returned. The powerful got away with it. The poor be damned.
Today Lahore, according to official records, has 66 metro buses. Another source, official it seems, claims that the total number of buses in Lahore is 650. Our sources claim that the real operating number is barely 120 buses. One would not like to speculate about what happened to the rest. Amazingly, the Quaid-i-Azam then instructed that once the road transportation was sufficient, work must be planned for an underground system. But with him went his dreams.
Let us undertake a comparative look at other world cities. It might provide us a road map for the future. Take a city like London with a population of 7.7m, almost half the size of a wildly expanding Lahore. It has 8,600 buses plying 675 routes.  
Public transportation in London started in 1829 with horse-drawn omnibuses. At a very rapid speed all buses are being converted to electric. In 1912 the first electric underground trains started. As car ownership rose the number of buses declined from a high of 10,250. Now cars must pay emission costs and their number is falling.
Let us look at another example from the sub-continent. Take an Indian city like Kolkota, once known as Calcutta, with a population of 15 million plus, very much near the bursting Lahore. This historic city has 40,000 private and public transport buses and another 6,000 minibuses. Given this the city has approximately one million motorcycles. But then Kolkota has an underground train service with 26 stations servicing 31.3 kilometers. Of recent given that the city is surrounded by water, it now has a series of underwater lines.
Take a city like Karachi. Last week the ad hoc government added 80 buses to the city’s fleet taking it to a shameful 300 buses. Imagine a city of 17.3 million persons with just 300 buses. The result is that motorcycles abound, what to speak of a rise in crime rates.
Over the last few years, several proposals have been put forward by bus companies for Lahore. Strangely, all of them have been returned as being “unworkable”. Just what is wrong? Why does Lahore not have a large electric fleet of double and single decker buses to help the people out. The cost of a posh SUV equals the cost of a double decker bus. The more the buses the fewer will be cars and the lethal motorcycle numbers. 
The existence of these 4.2m lethal smog-creating motorcycles have changed life in Lahore in a massive way, and all solely because the police and the bureaucracy being unable to enforce the law. There are several ills that flow from these massive police failures. Firstly, they are unable to stop underage teenagers from driving motorcycles at neck-breaking speeds. Added to this is the undeniable fact that they refuse to wear helmets. In the walled city narrow lanes their speed has created a massive menace.
But the most tragic and sad outcome of these speeding youngsters is that kite-flying, an ancient Lahore tradition, has been banned by a set of illiterate politicians. With the police totally at fault a social custom, and now a massive tourist attraction, has been killed off.
But one cannot solely blame the police for this sad outcome. With buses not available and with the city expanding beyond control, using bicycles by even the poor seems out of the question. My wife and her elder sister used to go to college on bicycles, and no one dared to pester them. Now with unlicenced motorcyclists, our social norms have dropped to shameful levels.
Without buses what possibly could people do to solve their daily transport problems? Distances forbid bicycles. Motorcycles are rapid and economical. With two or three per household, it is possible to move from one place to another. But then long distances are still difficult on a motorcycle. 
Also, the fact remains that the number of deaths from kite strings is less than what one can count on our fingers. All the deaths are because unlicenced youngsters without helmets at fast speeds invite trouble. All the death, less than two dozen a year, are in areas where kites are flown. The number is smaller than those hit crossing a road.
So here we have a situation where one set of problems – no buses for the poor and middle-classes – each connected to another. There is absolutely no doubt that our rulers, of every ilk and shade, have been unable to solve the problems of the people. All this, additionally, has led to a massive income disparity that further deepens the problems of transportation, as also of a cynical social behaviour mismatch with the reality of our age.
