• ECP can take legal action against contesting parties over violations
KARACHI: As the campaign for the upcoming general elections gears up, the contesting political parties blatantly violate the Code of Conduct meticulously prepared by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) by misusing and defacing the public property through advertisements of their banners, slogans and graffiti for Feb 8 polls in order to promote their candidates and leaders.  
The Election Commission of Pakistan on Dec 20, 2023 announced a Code of Conduct for political parties, contesting candidates, election agents and polling agents.  
Its Point No 25 of the code states: “In no case, the political parties, contesting candidates, election agents or their supporters shall affix posters on walls or any building without prior approval of the owner/institution. However, affixing of posters on public places including bridges, national institutions and installations shall be strictly prohibited.” 
According to Point No 26, “There shall be complete ban on hoardings, billboards, wall chalking, and panaflexes of any size. Violation will be treated as an illegal practice.” 
The apparent activities of political parties, which are actively participating in the elections, are in clear breach of the Code of Conduct prepared by the ECP.  
The election campaigns have also left the writ of the city administration ineffective as recently the local government had put a ban on the use of infrastructure falling under the municipal authority for wall chalking, placing banners, hanging flags, etc.  
A recent visit to prominent locations of the metropolis showed relentless and blatant misuse and exploitation of key road links and major infrastructures of city by political parties.  
Overhead bridges, pedestrian bridges and fences along roadside grills, which all are public property, are being misused by political parties for electioneering.  
The walls have been painted with party flags and political slogans.  
The parties are misusing the public property by painting them with colours used on their flags and planting banners, posters and flags on poles and other prominent public places of the metropolis.  
In some areas giant-sized billboards have also been erected on pedestrian and overhead bridges along with portraits of political leaders and candidates.  
Violation of local govt laws 
Apart from the Code of Conduct of the ECP, which prevents parties and candidates from using the public property for their promotion and campaign, on January 2, the city administration in Karachi also banned the use of infrastructure falling under the municipal authority for wall chalking, placing banners and hanging of flags.  
In a letter to the commissioner of Karachi, the municipal commissioner on directives of Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab Siddiqi had asked him to use his office to make the ban effective and ensure compliance by all political parties. However, the authorities admit that so far the ban has remained ineffective.  
“The ban is not effective so far,” Mayor Wahab told Dawn.  
“We remove their [election campaign] stuff [banners, billboards and flags] but they fix them again. So we have written to the Karachi commissioner to make sure the implementation of election rules through their returning officers and district returning officers. They can take legal action against the contesting parties and candidates over such violations.” 
The mayor claimed that the municipal administration was removing parties’ flags, banners and election campaign-related promotional billboards from the infrastructure of the city and his own Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) was also affected by such operations.  
“We are doing our job without any discrimination,” the mayor claimed.  
“We have even removed PPP flags from all Gizri areas. We have requested from all the parties to cooperate and don’t ruin the city infrastructures for their campaigns. Such stuff doesn’t give any tidy look to the city and only adds to operational expenses of the administration.”

2,Sindh health dept plans task force after five locally transmitted cases of JN.1 variant emerge,"Three more passengers, in their early 20s, test positive for Covid-19 upon arrival at Karachi airport.","KARACHI: As citizens find little respite from respiratory infections, the Sindh health department confirmed on Saturday the emergence of five locally transmitted cases of JN.1, the highly contagious new variant of Covid-19, which is currently a cause of concern in several countries.
The day also saw three more passengers, in their early 20s, testing positive for Covid-19 upon their arrival at the Jinnah International Airport, Karachi.
The male passengers, two of them arrived from Jeddah and one from Abu Dhabi, hailed from Qambar Shahdadkot, Mohmand Agency and North Waziristan.
Sources said they left for their homes after being advised to self-quarantine. Their blood samples for detecting the variant they suffered from had been sent to a laboratory, they added.

Three more air travellers test positive for Covid

The sources said the five locally transmitted cases of JN.1 were reported by the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH). Three of the five patients were women.
“The health department is closely monitoring the situation and plans to set up a task force soon to tackle the emerging threat from JN.1,” shared a health department spokesperson.
He added that the four passengers earlier tested positive for JN.1 were recovering well at home.
Speaking to Dawn, health experts shared that though there seemed to be a slight decrease in the number of respiratory infections in the city, the situation was still worrisome.
“Cases have gone down a bit but we need to be cautious as complications in patients could occur anytime,” said Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, a senior general physician representing the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA).
He added that recovery in some cases was taking longer than expected time. “There is a need for increasing screening and testing services as patients report with flu, chest infections and at times with pneumonia and we need to have specific diagnosis.”
Seconding his opinion, Dr Altaf Hussain Khatri, another GP and PMA representative, said that while flu cases had reduced, a lot of patients were reporting with persistent cough.
Karachi has been seeing a rising number of flu cases this season starting from October 2023. Hospitalisation and mortalities have been very low, largely involving the elderly and people with compromised immunity, the experts said.

4,"A City, Cinema & A Community launched",Durriya Kazi says subcontinent’s cinema was deeply connected with people’s lives,"KARACHI: A book titled A City, Cinema & A Community by retired Brigadier Abdul Rahman Siddiqi was launched here on Saturday. 
Presiding over the event, former Senator Javed Jabbar said there’s no other personality like Brig Siddiqi in the country. He brings forth a book at this stage of his life [he is 99 years old] after authoring nine books which reflect a range of history — the genesis of Pakistan, the migration that made Pakistan possible, the tragic separation of East Pakistan — and a great variety of thought. Also, he used to take out Defence Journal about various aspects of foreign policy. 
“It lays a distinct path in journalism. The publication being launched is also a distinct book of recollection. It’s a narrative that pays both tribute to the magnificent city of Delhi, which experienced a tragedy in the 19th century, survived and rebuilt itself, and an everlasting attribute to the magic of cinema,” he said. 
He said since the book is about cinema one has to think where cinema is today [in 2024]. “What a change! Cinema of the 1930s bringing together Hindus, Muslims and Parsis, regardless of caste and colour, and even as two nations were born, cinema continued the collaborative activity. The irony is that today the orthodoxy in Pakistan continues. I know at least two malls in the country that had the plan to build cinemas, but there was a strong family member in each of those two families who put their foot down and said, ‘no, cinema will not be built here’. Therefore for 250 million people we only have 60 cinemas and 150 screens. We should have 6,000 cinemas. We are actually killing the cinema.” 

Durriya Kazi says subcontinent’s cinema was deeply connected with people’s lives

Mr Jabbar said cinema-going has become an elitist exercise as the average person such as the rickshawalla, the real backbone of cinema, now can’t afford Rs800 or Rs1,200 for a movie ticket. 
He added he’s aware of the fact that moviemaking is not an inexpensive business. “This raises the issue should we allow a limited number of Indian movies to come in? A rational limit in order to enable cinemas to start earning money.” 
The author of the book, Brig Siddiqi, went down memory lane to highlight the contents of A City, Cinema & A Community. 
He said when he was a child he watched two movies, one was Indian and the other was a Charlie Chaplain film. He talked about a commercial slump of the 1930s, especially in the retail business. One of the affected shops was owned by his maternal uncle. He also mentioned cinema houses, especially Elphinstone, in Delhi and their connection with the city’s cultural life. 
Banking Ombudsman Sirajuddin Aziz was the chief guest on the occasion. He said he’s been reading Brig Siddiqi’s writing since his teen years when the author used to write for Dawn in relation to strategic analyses. But A City, Cinema & A Community came as a shock to him for its different topic. Once he started reading it, he couldn’t put it down. It has different segments and the last part has a novella which reads like a true story. “He talks about how he saw his first film at the age of six and slept during it. The book also mentions condemnation for bioscope when it was introduced.” 
Mr Aziz said the novella in the book covers 53 pages and narrates the story of Jamila and Hasina who once returning from college stopped at a cinema house to look at film posters. “I highly recommend the book because by reading it you’ll get a taste of the history of Indian cinema and get to know about the decay in human behaviour.” 
In her speech, artist and columnist Durriya Kazi said Brig Siddiqi has written about cinema with ‘authenticity’. “The subcontinent’s cinema wasn’t just about entertainment. It was deeply connected with people’s lives. Even in the riots that broke during partition, people didn’t stop going to cinema.”
Wajid Jawad said the book is an interesting narration of the 1930s and cinema’s effects on society. “Cinema challenged the traditional forms of entertainment and resulted in the beginning of a modern time which was welcomed by the younger generation.” 
Earlier, Saeed Allawala delivered the welcome address. The launch was organised by the Delhi Punjabi Saudagran Foundation and ATCO Literary Society.

JSMU Vice Chancellor Prof Amjad Saraj Memon informed the gathering about the university’s progress in recent years. 
The year 2023, he recalled, had been a period of growth and collaborations for JSMU. “This was achieved by introducing new programmes, signing MoUs with national and international organisations, and opening new campuses.”
He highlighted various ongoing projects at JSMU, including the establishment of a Sindh Employees Social Security Institution (Sessi) affiliated hospital for the School of Nursing and Midwifery and establishment of Pakistan’s first preventive cardiology clinic, operating at no cost for the underserved residents of Landhi.
Prof Huma Ali, the chairperson of the convocation committee also addressed the event. Registrar Dr Azam Khan administered the oath from the graduating students.

6,"Ex-NA speaker Fehmida, her spouse move SHC against rejection of nomination papers",KARACHI: Former National Assembly speaker Dr Fehmida Mirza and her spouse Dr Zulfiqar Mirza on Saturday approached...,"KARACHI: Former National Assembly speaker Dr Fehmida Mirza and her spouse Dr Zulfiqar Mirza on Saturday approached the Sindh High Court against rejection of their nomination papers by returning officers (ROs) and then an election tribunal.
The couple asked the SHC to set aside the ROs and tribunal’s decisions and sought directives for the Election Commission of Pakistan to accept their candidature from Badin’s national and provincial assembly seats.
The petitioners contended that their nomination papers were turned down over a financial liability, but loans in question had been obtained or written off by companies and not Dr Fehmida herself.
The ROs had rejected their papers on the grounds that their names fell in a default list sent by the State Bank of Pakistan.
On Jan 8, an appellate election tribunal had also dismissed their five election appeals against the orders of ROs and observed that they had failed to mention the financial facility availed by the Mirza Sugar Mills, mainly owned by both the candidates, and also unable to disclose about a judgement and decree of the SHC against the company and Dr Fehmida.
They filed five constitutional petitions in the SHC impugning as many orders passed by the tribunal and ROs.
Citing the ECP, provincial election commissioner, ROs, MCB Bank and others as respondents, their counsel submitted that both the petitioners had filed nomination papers from NA-223 (Badin-II) while former Sindh home minister had also submitted his papers from PS-70, PS-71 and PS-72.
The petitioners stated that Dr Fehmida and her husband’s shareholding in the Mirza Sugar Mills and Pangrio Sugar Mills was limited to 12.7 per cent only. 
They submitted that as per the decree, the directors of Mirza Sugar Mills were found liable to pay an amount of around Rs219.7 million.
They also argued that the ROs and tribunal had failed to appreciate even the judgement and decree passed by the SHC in October and November last year as the same had abundantly clear that the liability of directors including Dr Fehmida, raised out of the personal guarantee submitted by her and not pursuant to any loan obtained by her in personal capacity.
The petitioners further maintained that the SHC has already decided that any person holding less than 51pc shares in a company, which was a defaulter regarding a loan, could not be disqualified to contest elections since he/she in his/her personal capacity had not obtained any loan and the same did not fall within the definition of a defaulter.
They asked the SHC to overturn the impugned orders and sought direction for the ECP and other respondents not to allot the election symbol ‘star’ of the Grand Democratic Alliance to any other candidates.
Meanwhile, Aurangzeb Farooqui of the Pakistan Rah-i-Haq Party on Saturday filed a petition in the SHC against the orders of an election tribunal and the RO regarding rejecting his nomination papers from PS-88 on the ground that he was not a registered voter of Sindh.
He submitted that the ECP and other respondents as well as his opponent parties had illegally changed his address in the voters list.

In a statement, he said the price of basic items such as eggs, chicken and beef had gone beyond the purchasing power of common man.
Therefore, the caretaker provincial government should ensure implementation of one-dish policy in weddings and that celebrations in marriage halls should be limited to 10pm. This, he said, would not only help control the rising inflation and energy crisis in the country but also make arranging marriages easier for the poor.  
He said that these policies were being strictly implemented in Punjab, but the Sindh province still lagged behind in this regard.

10,MQM-P submits party tickets for Hyderabad seats after 11th hour changes,"HYDERABAD: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), renamed as MQM-Pakistan, has picked six candidates –- a mix of new...","HYDERABAD: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), renamed as MQM-Pakistan, has picked six candidates –- a mix of new and old faces –- with 11th hour changes late Friday evening for its six traditional constituencies of Hyderabad. 
“Such a delay in the announcement of candidates’ names had never been seen in the Altaf Hussain-Led MQM. The post-Altaf Muttahida, however, occasionally witnesses new situations. Some disagreements among local zonal leaderships over award of party tickets had cropped up which delayed submission of tickets,” said a party source. 
The party submitted the tickets to the returning officers concerned on Friday, the last day for withdrawal of nomination papers.
The source explained that since it was now a unified MQM-P, multiple inputs had prolonged the serious deliberations over choice of candidates. 
In the 2018 general elections, the party had lost one provincial constituency PS-64 (Latifabad) which has since been renumbered as PS-62. PPP’s Abdul Jabbar Khan had won it in 2018 defeating Muttahida’s Yunus Gaddi with a narrow margin of 3,604 votes. PPP has fielded Jabbar Khan again in the same constituency for the Feb 8 polls. 
Until Friday evening, the party had decided to awarded the ticket for NA-219 (Latifabad) to Syed Waseem Hussain and Dilawar Qureshi for the NA-220 (Hyderabad City and, according to reports, their tickets were also submitted before the ROs concerned. 
However, in a late night development, the Karachi-based party leadership had a second thought. At the 11th hour, it dropped Dilawar Qureshi and replacing him with Abdul Aleem Khanzada for NA-219 while Wasim Hussain was given ticket for NA-220. Hussain even otherwise is a resident of the Hyderabad City constituency.
The Muttahida had won both NA seats of Latifabad and Hyderabad City while Qasimabad-rural taluka seat had gone to the PPP in the previous polls. 
PS-62 falls under NA-219 where party has now fielded Sabir Kaimkhani to face PPP’s Jabbar Khan. Kaimkhani was MNA from NA-219 in the last National Assembly. He had served as an MPA in 2013 as well.
PS-62 has been made a bit difficult for the Muttahida as some pockets that were not traditionally part of it have been included in the constituency. This seemingly consolidated PPP candidate’s position. 
For PS-63 (Latifabad), Kamran Qureshi, a new face, would contest polls. Qureshi is son of MQM’s old diehard late Shafiq Qureshi who had won PS-41 in the 1988 general elections.
Waseem Hussain was MNA from NA-220 in the 2013 assembly from Hyderabad City constituency but he had later jumped to Dr Farooq Sattar-led Muttahida Organising Committee after developing differences with the party and emergence of PSP.
The party had lost NA-220 and PS-45 in the 2002 general elections to Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal. MMA’s Sahibzada Zubair had defeated MQM’s Aftab Ahmed Shaikh on NA-220 while Rehman Rajput had beaten MQM’s Farooq Qureshi on PS-45. Another new face is Rashid Khan, the joint zonal in-charge who is picked for PS-64, a second provincial seat under NA-220. Nasir Qureshi who had won the election on PS-65 in 2018 has been given party ticket again for the seat.
Insiders claimed that hectic deliberations took place for the finalisation of tickets for constituencies. “Sabir Kaimkhani was interested in getting the ticket for NA-219. He had remained the taluka nazim of Latifabad in 2005 after partyless local government elections and an MPA in 2013. Since he had continuously been enjoying these honours and privileges from the party, people thought he might be dropped,” said sources. “But he has been chosen for PS-62, they added.

Discussing climate change, moderator Javed Soz observed that it was a subject which was seriously discussed neither by governments nor by the general public although it was one of the most important issues of global concern. “We need to pay serious attention to this issue,” he said.
A panelist Tariq Alexander said that Sindh was faced with water shortage problem; underground water happened to be brackish. He maintained that Indus River had been contaminated and polluted while the Indus delta was vanishing. He noted with concern that the people living in the Indus delta areas were facing poverty and impoverishment. The delta’s survival was the key for environment, he added.
Environmental activist Nasir Panhwar said that urban settlements emerged without any planning as there was no Master Plan available. He said that these settlements had blocked old natural waterways and as a result of which destructions were seen in urban areas. He said that temperature was also rising every year while agricultural lands had been converted to housing schemes.
He stated that this situation would lead to food insecurity. He said that world was focusing on ‘clean energy’ and utilising all resources for this energy whereas Pakistan was still promoting unhealthy anti-environment energy.
Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum representative Fatima Majeed said that mangroves were ‘respected’ by fishermen. These mangroves have been serving as sources of livelihood as they help flourish fish production but now these forests are being uprooted. She said that mangroves historically grew at the locations where sweet and sea waters meet but Indus River sadly had been witnessing inadequate flows. She said sweet Indus water flows was not reaching the sea. She said that Indus River was destroyed over the last 70 years although its creation took centuries.

Talking to journalists after inaugurating the party’s election office in Tando Adam on Saturday, he said that regularly held elections were life of a democratic society. No country could move forward if elections were rigged, he said. 
He said the country’s economy had been on the decline for the past 76 years while politicians were busy bickering with each other like spectators in a cricket match. 
He said that Pakistan Peoples Party that had been ruling Sindh for last 15 years had destroyed the province in all sectors. Inflation, loadshedding of electricity, gas and unavailability of drinking water had made peoples’ lives miserable, he said. 
He said the real reason behind inflation was corruption and imposition of unbearable taxes on the poor. The electricity tariff jumped from Rs12 to Rs60, gas tariff rose by 200 per cent whereas fuel prices hiked to Rs300 a litre but the rulers’ hunger remained limitless, he said. 
He said that when Pakistan came into being, a rupee was equal to a dollar but the poor governance and corruption had caused one dollar to rise to Rs300 and burdened the country under billions of dollars debts, he said. 
Billions were received as grant and donation in the name of flood victims and devastated areas but the money went missing whereas the party’s welfare wing, Al Khidmat, built houses and provided ration and tents to the victims, he said. 
Mehanti said that it was peoples’ inalienable right to vote and elect candidates of their choice in freely and fairly held elections. 
Sanghar JI emir Abdul Ghafoor Ansari and other party leaders Abdul Rasheed Rajput, Talat Mehmood Qureshi, Jaan Mohammed, Zaheeruddin Babar, Faisal Mughal and Raja Waseem were also present on the occasion.
