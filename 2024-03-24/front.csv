0,Can Zaka shatter Kaira’s governorship dreams?,"Zardari, Bilawal ‘at odds’ over right man for gubernatorial post in Punjab","A new contender, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) former chairman Zaka Ashraf, seems to have entered the fray for the coveted position of Punjab governor.
But this wild card entry, if indeed it occurred as reported, given the absence of official confirmation, does not seem to have sat well with other PPP leaders, who see the governor’s position as a platform for the party’s revival in the province, which was once its bastion.
Until a couple of days ago, PPP leaders, upon being asked whom they saw as the new Punjab governor, would instantly point towards Qamar Zaman Kaira, while acknowledging an anti-Kaira camp within the party. However, as the process of the governor’s appointment protracted, another contender entered the race via social media.
Initially, many who saw Kaira as the only strong contender wrote off this new contender, saying that he does not have the legs or the political wisdom required to accomplish the task that had been set for the occupier of this office. But of late, the confidence with which they rubbished these speculations seems to have diminished.
This new contender, Zaka Ashraf, seems to have unnerved many within the party’s fold, even those who had initially positioned themselves against Qamar Zaman Kaira.
Kaira, on the other hand, was also not entirely banking on merit. He too has the support, according to several party leaders, of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, and also some other powerful people. Zaka, on the other hand, is an old friend of the PPP co-chairman, President Asif Ali Zardari.
This makes this appointment matter a tug of war between the father and son, who, as per party leaders, have differed on several issues of late, including important appointments.
Contrary to the speculations, one of the party’s central leaders strongly denied rumors of Zaka Ashraf being in any list whatsoever, saying that the race is between Kaira and Nadeem Afzal Chan.
Alluding to Yousaf Raza Gillani’s possible election as the Senate chairman, he said the party has already bestowed South Punjab with an important position and now the governor will be chosen from upper Punjab.
He said these speculations were a product of social media and had no shred of reality in them. He said the party will appoint governors of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) after the Senate elections.
Despite this denial, many in Punjab believe there is a grain of truth in these speculations.
A leader in Punjab said they are hearing rumors within the party about the possible appointment of Zaka as Punjab’s ceremonial figurehead.
He said while many strongly opposed Zaka, some elements in the party were also advocating for him solely because of their antipathy towards Kaira. They admitted that Zaka Ashraf was no good for this job but said Zaka in office would mean Kaira out of office.
One such leader said despite the PPP being a shadow of its former self in Punjab, which it once saw as its stronghold, the infighting within ranks was off the charts.
Every big name here is out on a mission to grub out the other. A lot of this stems from poor decision making of PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who has thus far failed to appoint the right people on party portfolios, he said.
This tug of war within the family, according to another party leader, is causing a delay in appointments of Punjab and K-P governors by the PPP.
A leader from Sindh, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Zaka might be President Zardari’s friend but that alone was no qualification for the job. In fact, he was ill-suited for the position.
He said it is up to the leadership whether they chose Kaira or anyone else but anyone in that position should work to revive the party in Punjab. “He should be a people’s person, not some elitist businessman,” he added.

He described repeated “raids on his home, harassment of his family, and the need to relocate them abroad” for their safety. Despite these challenges, Azhar continued to work for the party from an undisclosed location since May 2023.
Azhar stated that after much deliberation, he decided to step down from his roles, expressing concern for the party's well-being and his dedication to its interests. He pledged to remain a loyal and ideological worker of the PTI.

2,Pak-Afghan trade talks open today,Commerce secretary to reach Kabul for bilateral discussion,"Pakistan and Afghanistan will hold crucial trade talks in Kabul on Monday (today), Foreign Office said in a statement on Sunday, days after Pakistani air strikes inside the neighbouring country targeting the terrorist hideouts.
A terse statement, issued here by the Foreign Office, said that Commerce Secretary Khurrum Agha would undertake a two-day visit to Afghanistan on Monday to discuss trade related matters. “Pakistan remains committed to promoting trade and people-to-people ties with Afghanistan,” it added.
The bilateral talks are taking place at the time of heightened tensions between the two neighbours. The deterioration of the ties has undermined bilateral trade in recent months. Besides, frequent border closures for a variety of reasons also negatively impacted the trade.

Pakistan, being not happy with the Taliban government for its reluctance to act against the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates, took a series of measures in October last year to end the misuse of Afghan Transit Trade (ATT) facility.
These measures included the addition of certain items to the negative list, the implementation of 100% bank guarantees, and other regulatory actions. Afghan authorities contend that Pakistan's actions led to a 50% reduction in trade through its borders, with a notable shift towards Iran.
 
Pakistan justified these steps as necessary to prevent the misuse of the ATT facility, citing a significant surge in Afghan imports through transit trade during the 2022-23 period. Furthermore, some items with limited demand in Afghanistan witnessed an unprecedented influx.

Authorities in Pakistan pointed out that the transit trade mechanism was being exploited for smuggling goods intended for Afghanistan back into Pakistan. These measures aimed to address this issue and ensure the proper functioning of the transit trade system while curbing illegal activities.
Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have been tense for months over the TTP issue. On March 18, Pakistan conducted intelligence-based anti-terrorist operation in Afghanistan. The strikes were in retaliation to March 16 Mir Ali terrorist attack that killed seven soldiers, including two officers.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif in a recent interview warned of blocking the trade corridor that Afghanistan is using to export goods to India via Pakistan if cross-border terrorist attacks do not stop. Kabul insists that trade and commercial ties must not be linked with the political relationship.
