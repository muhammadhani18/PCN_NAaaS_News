0,"PPP reiterates demand to officially declare ZA Bhutto martyr, hero of democracy",Party’s Sindh chapter president says public gathering will be held in Larkana on April 4,"As the 45th death anniversary of Pakistan Peoples Party's founding Chairman and former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto approaches closer, the party has called for recognising him as a martyr and a hero of democracy.
The PPP's Sindh President Nisar Ahmed Khuhro reiterated this demand at a press conference in Hyderabad on Sunday, citing the recent judgment of the Supreme Court which admitted that Bhutto was convicted after an unfair trial.
He informed that a public meeting will be organised in Larkana on April 4 to pay tribute to Bhutto on his martyrdom anniversary. The event will start after Iftari at night. He observed that the apex court took around 12 years after the filing of presidential reference by President Asif Zardari during his first stint.
He took exception to comparing Bhutto with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's leader Imran Khan, saying the former had many achievements attributed to him besides being a martyr while the latter has only faced jail.
Responding to a question, Khuhro acknowledged that the situation of law and order in four or five districts of Larkana and Sukkur divisions is getting worse. ""Someone told me that even the motorway is closed in the evening and the railing fence is torn and stolen from places.""
He questioned why the National Highway and Motorway Police did not patrol the Sukkur-Multan motorway and prevent such theft while ensuring that the road remained open through the day.
Evading a reply to explain why the incumbent government is not taking action against the dacoits infesting riverbed areas in Sukkur and Larkana divisions, Khuhro turned criticism to the former caretaker government.
He said unlike the elected governments, the caretaker governments are supposed to be apolitical. ""If such is the case then why for eight months the interim government didn't take action against the dacoits?"" he questioned.
Khuhro said the Sindh police had also led an operation against the outlaws in Karachi and that the cops emerged successful. In comparison, he added, the outlaws hiding in some rural areas should not be a big deal. ""Some questions do rise against the eight-month long caretaker government.""
When asked about the government's reported plans to hand over large tracts of land for corporate farming in the province, he asked from where irrigation water will be provided to those lands. ""The current water situation is such that the available water is already insufficient for irrigation [in Sindh]."" He mentioned that ongoing practice of water rotation also proved the existing shortage.
He said neither water is available in the system nor new dams are being built to enhance storage during rains and floods and to supply the same water for irrigation. Khuhro, however, clarified that he was not opposed to the idea of bringing more land under cultivation because the process will create employment and will contribute to economic growth. ""I don't think this idea is bad from a development point of view.""
Yet, he reiterated, the question still remained from where the government will provide water for those tens of thousands of acres of land. He said the people ought to be taken into confidence over the issue.

1,Suicide turns out to be murder,"Autopsy, investigations prove retired cop strangled to death, burnt by sons","A retired policeman, initially thought to have died by self-immolation in Soldier Bazaar area, was, in fact, strangled to death by his own sons. The suspected culprits were arrested by police after the post-mortem examination exposed the grim truth.
The burnt body of Saleem Ansari, a 65-year-old retired police officer, was discovered in a residence in the Gul Rana Colony of Soldier Bazaar on Saturday. Identified through forensic procedures, Ansari's demise raised suspicions due to the circumstances surrounding his death.
Preliminary investigations by Asad Elahi, SHO Soldier Bazaar police station, suggested that Ansari had retired while serving at Soldier Bazaar police station and was living alone on the first floor of the house following separation from his wife. His married son resided on the ground floor of the same house. Further scrutiny revealed that Ansari had a small retail shop.
While early assumptions leaned towards self-immolation, evidence collected by the Crime Scene Unit prompted a closer examination of the case. Despite objections from one of Ansari's sons, Imran, who is also a serving policeman, the post-mortem was conducted by SP Liaquatabad Division Alina Rajpar.
The post-mortem report confirmed the grim reality: Ansari had been strangled to death. Subsequently, a case was registered against the deceased's sons under section 302/34, based on the post-mortem findings and medical examination.
SHO Elahi revealed that Imran, along with his brother, played a pivotal role in orchestrating their father's murder and attempted to pass it off as a suicide. However, their efforts were thwarted by the diligent intervention of SP Rajpar, who ensured the completion of the post-mortem process, revealing the true nature of the incident.
Both sons of the deceased were arrested by Soldier Bazaar police, and legal proceedings have been launched against them.

2,Jeay Sindh Mahaz stages protests against ‘daku raj’,Says dacoits given leeway to justify an operation and annihilation of arable land,"The Jeay Sindh Mahaz held protests in 10 cities of Sindh on Sunday to condemn increasing sway of the robbers of riverbed and forest areas; migration of Hindus and kidnappings.
""Daku raj [rule of dacoits] has been thrust upon the people so that in the garb of an operation against the outlaws inhabiting the riverbed areas, the precious cultivable land of the province can be occupied,"" said JSM Chairman Riaz Ali Chandio at a protest outside Hyderabad Press Club.
He argued that the dacoits have been given leeway to harass the entire regions in Sukkur and Larkana divisions where business, agriculture and even education have been affected by the crimes. He referred to the recent killing of a school teacher Allah Rakhio Nandwani in Kashmore-Kandhkot district on March 18 and said the incident was aimed to frighten the teachers so that they stop going to schools.
Chandio believed that tactics like recording videos of kidnapped persons, who are often beaten or undressed in those videos, killings of innocent hostages and dumping of their bodies are all meant to instil fear among the people.
The JSM's leader lamented that the Hindu community is also being specifically targeted by the outlaws and a large number of Hindu families have started to migrate out of the country. He alleged that not only dacoits demand extortion from Hindu traders but also local leaders of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) do the same.
The protesters carried portraits of Priya Kumari, a child who was kidnapped from a village in Saleh Patt taluka of Sukkur district and blamed the government for its inaction to recover the child. The protesters demanded that the artificial dacoit rule in Sindh should be put to an end and the killing of Sukkur IBA's Prof Ajmal Sawand and of the school teachers Hidayat Lohar and Nandwani should be brought to book.
They also called for safe recovery of more than 100 persons including children who are at present held hostage by the dacoits. The protests took place in Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Matiari, Benazirabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Thatta, Larkana and Noushehro Feroze districts

3,Healthcare commission fails to curb quackery,Dozens of fake doctors openly operate clinics without any fear,"The Sindh Healthcare Commission (SHCC) appears to be faltering in its responsibilities as numerous fake doctors continue to operate clinics and private hospitals unchecked in the outskirts of Hyderabad.
Many such establishments operate without the requisite registration from the SHCC, while licensed private hospitals exploit citizens by charging arbitrary fees instead of government-approved charges. Unfortunately, the Health Department remains passive in addressing this pressing issue.
The Sindh Assembly ratified the Sindh Healthcare Commission Act in 2013, aimed at overseeing health facilities, their registration, classification, fee determination, inspection of private health establishments, and overall supervision.
The SHCC was established to enforce regulations on health facilities and ensure their compliance. Despite the official issuance of the SHCC Regulations in November 2017, practical implementation seems lacking.
Under the act and regulations, combating fraud by private health establishments falls within the SHCC's purview. Previously, the Health Department took action against quack doctors, with district health offices serving as accessible points for citizen complaints. However, since the SHCC assumed authority, direct action against doctors by health department officers has ceased. Instead, actions are taken in the presence of SHCC-designated representatives.
In the initial months post-establishment, significant crackdowns on fake doctors occurred, either directly by the SHCC or through appointed representatives. However, such actions waned over time, leading to a proliferation of fake clinics, particularly in Hyderabad's suburbs like Latifabad and Qasimabad, including areas like Hosari, Khatar, Seri, Tando Alam Mari, Tando Hyder, Tando Jam, and Hattri.
Many quack doctors have expanded their operations, even establishing hospitals specialising in maternity services, where unqualified individuals perform surgical procedures. These establishments often display boards featuring fake degrees. Unfortunately, patients suffer from inadequate treatment, and cases of mistreatment leading to deterioration or death continue to surface.
While the SHCC is mandated to register and supervise private hospitals, its inspection activities seem lacking. Numerous unregistered private hospitals operate in Hyderabad, with even registered ones failing to display approved fee charts as required by law. Patients seeking emergency treatment are often coerced into depositing exorbitant sums, leading to financial distress.
Moreover, adherence to regulations, such as displaying registration certificates issued by the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council, and regulating the sale of non-prescription medicines, remains overlooked by the SHCC.
In light of these issues, the apparent inaction of the SHCC raises concerns about its effectiveness in safeguarding public health and regulating the healthcare sector in Hyderabad.

4,From cotton fields to classrooms,"Women farmworkers experience transformative journey, gaining literacy, confidence","Fifteen years ago, Ghulam Zuhra entered into matrimony without the opportunity for an early education. Like the other women in Jamal Dahri Goth, a village nestled a mere two kilometres from the National Highway, her life unfolded in the arduous realm of agriculture as a cotton picker—a daily wage labourer.
The revelation of a literacy centre opening in her village reached Zuhra one fine day, offering the prospect of learning to read, write, and grasp basic mathematics.
Initially, the idea didn't immediately capture her attention. ""Can someone like me be enrolled in a school or centre?"" she pondered sceptically. However, as she puts it, it turned out to be a dream come true.
Undeterred by the challenges posed by being a mother of four children and a financially constrained cotton picker, Zuhra became part of the inaugural cohort of around 30 women enrolled in the literacy centre, an initiative facilitated by the Sindh Community Foundation. For three hours each day, they gathered under the guidance of Miss Rihana, the village's sole woman holding an Intermediate certificate.
To Zuhra and her peers, the youthful Rihana became a beacon of hope, affectionately referred to as ""Baji,"" signifying sisterhood. With newfound confidence, Zuhra showcased her burgeoning writing and counting skills, meticulously inscribing numbers in her mother tongue—hik, ba…teh [one, two, three...]. Her smile radiated a sense of accomplishment as she proudly declared, ""I can count and know how to keep my accounts straight. No one can cheat me—even in the market,"" raising her eyebrows with a chuckle.
In the span of a three-month course, Ghulam Zuhra and her comrades experienced a transformative journey, gaining not just literacy but a renewed sense of life.

Suhni, a fellow learner alongside Zuhra, chimed in, expressing gratitude to their husbands for the encouragement that paved the way for their newfound empowerment at the literacy centre.
""Literacy plays a very important role and it helps in proper calculation of their wages and also gives confidence to these women cotton workers,"" commented Javed Hussain, the environmentalist.
He said that the education also gave these women confidence to negotiate to get their due rights and decent working conditions during the picking season.
He shared that more than a million women cotton workers are engaged in cotton picking in the province, adding almost 90 per cent of women cotton workers are not literate.
""Their (cotton pickers) wages and working conditions are deplorable. We have organised their groups and also provided education on labour rights in addition the literacy program.""
""Our literacy programme is six-month long and provides informal education in Sindhi, mathematics and English. We have strong coordination with directorate of non-formal education for assessment and certification,"" he explained.

5,Inflation dampens Eid sales in Karachi,Cloth markets and shopping centres witness noticeable drop in shoppers,"Inflation’s impact is unmistakable in Eidul Fitr shopping trends, with a noticeable decline in purchases of new clothes for the festive occasion. The sale of unstitched garments is subdued in men's clothing centres across the metropolitan city.
The surge in cloth prices and tailoring charges has prompted most citizens to prefer stitched garments, while buyers of unstitched fabrics are also scaling back. Consequently, the traditional vibrancy of clothing markets has diminished.
Men's clothing sales markets in Karachi, including Bolton Market, Jama Cloth, Sadar, Landhi, Liaquatabad, and Clifton, alongside the Bara markets in areas like Banaras, Paposh, Lasbela, Nazimabad, and Tariq Road, are witnessing a drop in shoppers.
The trend of purchasing unstitched cloth for Eid has been steadily declining, primarily due to rising cloth prices and sewing charges. This year, there's a significant reduction in clothing purchases, with a noticeable absence of the usual pre-Eid rush.
The shopping frenzy typically begins in Shaban, but this year, it's notably subdued. Garment traders attribute this to the devaluation of the rupee, which has increased the cost of imported cloth, coupled with local mills hiking prices due to rising costs and increased business expenses, including delivery and transportation costs.
Citizens note that a regular suit costs between Rs2,500 and Rs3,000, with stitching adding an additional Rs1,500, totaling Rs4,000 to Rs4,500. In comparison, stitched branded suits are available for at least Rs4,000 to Rs5,000, while common stitched suits range from Rs2,000 to Rs2,500, making them a more economical choice.
Despite inflation, buyers emphasise the tradition of sewing new attire for Eid, as it adds to the festivity of the occasion. Therefore, new clothes are stitched based on individual purchasing power.
The Bara market, also known as Chawla Market, in Nazimabad, is a prominent hub for men's clothing, offering imported and local fabrics. More than 100 shops in these markets cater to diverse preferences, selling cotton and various wash-and-wear fabrics. This year, shopkeepers are adjusting prices due to low buyer budgets caused by inflation.
Cotton suits are priced between Rs1,800 and Rs2,600, while wash-and-wear fabrics range from Rs1,500 to Rs2,000. Compared to last year, cloth prices have surged by Rs100 to Rs150 per meter, making a standard six-meter suit Rs600 to Rs900 pricier. However, shoppers appreciate the market's accessibility and diverse offerings.
According to cloth merchants, 60% of imported and 40% of locally manufactured cloth is purchased for men's clothing on Eid. Imported cloth primarily comes from China, while local cloth is predominantly sourced from Kamalia and Faisalabad. Due to increased business costs and reduced sales, no new stock of foreign cloth was ordered this Eid, exacerbating the scarcity of quality local fabrics and driving prices up by 30% compared to last year.
On Eid, cotton clothing fabric is preferred for its suitability in hot weather, whereas wash-and-wear fabrics are favored on regular days for their durability and wrinkle-resistant properties. Light-colored fabrics are popular during Eid festivities, with white, sky blue, and half-white being top choices, while darker hues such as navy blue, black, brown, and biscuit are favored by the youth.

6,Govt urged not to forget the guerrilla fighter Sufi,"Chairman Altaf Shakoor says public events held to remember Soriah Badshah Pir Pagara, none by govt","Great freedom fighter hero, Soriah Badshah Pir Sabghatullah Shah Rashdi, was remembered on his martyrdom anniversary, March 20, by the people of Sindh, but sadly the government did not arrange even a single event to pay homage to this great hero, said Pasban Democratic Party (PDP) Chairman Altaf Shakoor here Sunday.
He said this year public events were arranged on the platform of PDP and other forums to remember the Soriah Badshah Pir Pagara in Karachi, Hyderabad, Tando Adam and other places but sadly not a single event was arranged by the government. He said Soriah Badshah was a rebel and he fought British Imperialism. He said as many people sitting in the government still have sympathy for the former British rulers, they are too shy even to utter the name of the Soriah Badshah.
He said that the government of Sindh should name the Dow Medical College and University after the name of the Soriah Badshah, file reference in the Supreme Court to review the case of the Soriah Badshah on the pattern of the Bhutto case and announce official holiday on his martyrdom anniversary.
He said that Soriah Badshah fought for the freedom of our homeland. He said our country today faces economic slavery and we need another Soriah Badshah to fight this slavery. He said the debt trap is becoming more deadlier with every passing day and sadly the new government is also bent on getting more loan programs from the IMF, which is just unfortunate. The country doesn't need any new loans but to break the debt trap.

7,Bid to smuggle foreign currency foiled,"Officers on suspicion checked the luggage of a passenger and recovered 50,000 Saudi riyals concealed in a pack","Pakistan Customs officers at the Jinnah Terminal foiled a bid to smuggle foreign currency and arrested a Dubai-bound passenger with 50,000 Saudi riyals worth Rs3.7 million on Saturday.
Customs Additional Collector Muhammad Faisal said that the officers on suspicion checked the luggage of the passenger, Asad Ahmed, and recovered 50,000 Saudi riyals concealed in a pack.
Faisal said that passengers travelling internationally are permitted to take US$5,000 or the equivalent in foreign currency with them.
However, the passenger attempted to carry Saudi riyals worth Rs3.7 million, which was double the allowed limit. The officers have seized the recovered currency under the Customs Act.
Further investigation into the matter was underway.
