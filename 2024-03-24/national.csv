0,Experts urge cybersecurity focus,Offer practical solutions to avert internet shutdowns which cost millions per day,"IT analysts and experts have said that strengthening the cybersecurity landscape may help boost IT businesses and exports, while also deploying a host of tools and technologies in lawful interception.
The government can leverage smart city concepts and employ AI-powered surveillance systems which accurately identify individuals of interest, track suspects, and classify suspicious activities in crowded environments, they said.
While speaking to The Express Tribune, experts presented practical solutions and useful proposals to the government to avert internet shutdowns, keep growing IT businesses intact in the future.
They stressed that the government should invest in public education and awareness campaigns to promote responsible use of communication technologies during sensitive periods. Citizens should be encouraged to report suspicious activities, verify information before sharing. The government should enforce existing laws and regulations against offenders to maintain law and order without the need for mass communication shutdowns.
Government agencies, law enforcement organisations, and telecommunications providers can tap modern tools in lawful interception and operate them in accordance with relevant laws and regulations governing lawful interception activities. A number of tools and technologies used in lawful interception consist of packet sniffers, telecommunications monitoring systems, data retention systems, deep packet inspection (DPI) tools, and communication service provider (CSP) interfaces.

They suggested to the government that instead of blanket shutdowns of internet services, selective blocking or filtering techniques can be used to target specific regions or sources while minimising disruption to legitimate communication services.
The experts said implementing well-established emergency response protocols might be ample to address security threats promptly and effectively. This includes coordinated efforts between law enforcement agencies, emergency services, and telecommunications providers to manage crises while minimising disruption to essential communication services rather than imposing a blanket shutdown.
The complete suspension of mobile phone broadband services and mobile phone data causes both major financial losses to IT businesses and exquisite agonies to common people for want of services-cum-communications, tarnishes a good image of local IT companies and freelancers due to an inordinate procrastination in works of foreign clients.
The country registered monthly IT exports of $257 million, up 32% in February 2024 compared to the same month last year. Moreover, in a conversation with a private TV Channel, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is optimistic that IT exports could touch $3.5 billion this year.
“Absolutely, enhancing cybersecurity not only fortifies IT infrastructure against threats but also augments the potential for IT exports by ensuring safer digital environments. With Pakistan amidst an AI revolution, achieving an ambitious $10 billion annual export target is plausible. Success hinges on establishing research-centric universities, training skilled personnel, ensuring consistent tech policies, and revising tech syllabuses across all educational levels. To augment IT exports and maintain internet continuity, the government should invest in robust cybersecurity measures, incentivise IT innovation, and ensure stable internet infrastructure,” said Eminent IT analyst and SI Global Solutions CEO Noman Said.
He said indeed, internet disruptions significantly impact the IT sector, causing substantial financial losses and severely disrupting the daily lives of the populace. He said estimations of losses vary widely, however, it’s generally accepted that internet shutdowns can cost economies millions to billions of dollars per day globally. Millions globally are involved in the IT industry, spanning across IT corporations, companies, freelancers, web developers, fintech, e-commerce platforms, startups, e-stores, various apps, digital marketing, SEO skills, AI development, and IT education sectors.
Quaid-e-Awam University of Engineering, Science, and Technology Nawabshah, Department of Cyber Security Chairman Dr Adnan Ahmed Arain said after integrating advanced surveillance technologies and targeted interventions, authorities can ensure public safety and effectively manage security challenges without resorting to extreme measures.
“To strengthen our cybersecurity landscape, several key measures must be taken. First, a comprehensive national cybersecurity strategy should be developed, setting clear objectives and action plans. Second, existing laws and regulations must be reinforced, ensuring compliance with cybersecurity standards and facilitating international cooperation on cybercrime. Third, public awareness campaigns should be launched to promote cybersecurity best practices among citizens and organisations. Fourth, investments in cybersecurity workforce development are essential to build a skilled talent pool. Fifth, critical infrastructure sectors must be prioritised for cybersecurity protection. Finally, nurturing international cooperation and partnerships strengthens our collective defence against cross-border cyber threats,” he said.

1,‘Longer IMF programme could lead to debt trap’,"Dr Ashfaque Hasan Khan warns against IMF dependency, calls for domestic reforms","NUST Institute of Policy Studies (NIPS), Director General, Dr Ashfaque Hasan Khan, has stated that Pakistan should seek the new International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan package of $3-4 billion for a maximum period of three years, as a longer and larger programme would be an economic disaster, potentially making Pakistan another Argentina, which is stuck in a debt trap.
In a set of recommendations on the subject ‘Pakistan’s Economic Crisis: Challenges and The Way Forward’, Khan noted that the development suggests Pakistan is preparing to seek an $8 billion loan for a five-year programme. “This will be a disaster for Pakistan,” he said.
The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and the economic team should focus on attracting foreign investment from the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) platform and implementing reforms to strengthen the domestic economy instead of continually acquiring new debt to repay maturing debt, he urged.
If the nation continues to increase the size of the programme, he warned that Pakistan will be no different from Argentina, which has remained under an IMF programme for almost half a century now. Argentina has continually increased the size of the programme, now close to $43 billion, and has emerged as the largest customer of the IMF. “Hence, Argentina will never break free from the IMF’s clutches.”
The larger the amount a nation borrows from the IMF, the larger the repayment will be. “Our foreign exchange earnings will not be enough to repay the larger amount. Hence, we will further increase the size of the IMF loan, ultimately becoming like Argentina,” he cautioned.
Khan, who is a former economic advisor to the Ministry of Finance, stressed that the SIFC is a great initiative for Pakistan. “We are making efforts to attract more and more investment to the country. By doing so, we aim to bring more dollars into the country. Seeking a larger size of the IMF programme implies demeaning the work of the SIFC,” he said.
Securing a larger programme rather than seeking foreign investment is like “admitting defeat ourselves. In my view, with SIFC in operation, we don’t need a larger amount from the IMF.”
“Our negotiating team must concentrate on reforms rather than on policies,” he maintained.
He urged the authorities concerned to declare that this will be the last IMF programme. The authorities must set up a high-level committee to prepare an alternative plan that will be implemented after the expiry of the new programme in 2027.
Read The growing circular debt burden
A NIPS report, containing papers presented in the seminar, edited and reviewed by Khan, further stated that the root cause of the persistence of the large fiscal deficit during the last five to six years has been the ballooning expenditure – driven by exorbitant interest payments against total national debt. Why has the expenditure surged during the last five to six years? “The main reason is the persistence of keeping the SBP’s (State Bank of Pakistan) policy rate at an extraordinarily high level (22%) for a long period of time.”
Empirical evidence suggests that a 1% reduction in the policy rate will reduce interest payments (the single largest budgetary expenditure) by over Rs350 billion in one year. It has been empirically shown that this will also contribute to reducing inflation. It is proposed that SBP must gradually cut the policy rate to single digits (7-8%) by June 2027.
Imagine that if SBP reduces the interest rate from 22% to 16% by June 2025, it will reduce budgetary expenditure by at least Rs2,100 billion in just one and a half years. This will help reduce the budget deficit, resulting in less borrowing and less accumulation of public debt, it said.
The report further recommended reducing the cost of imported inputs. “Bring the exchange rate gradually to Rs240-250 per dollar. Ensure a two-way movement of the exchange rate. This will bring the rupee-dollar parity to Rs240-250 per dollar.”
Workers’ remittances have the potential to increase to over $40-45 billion a year if the hundi and hawala systems can be curbed.
SBP, in consultation with major foreign exchange companies, can streamline the flow of remittances. The Foreign Exchange Association can be used to bring more dollars through official channels, it said.
Reduce the prices of utilities (electricity and gas). Energy sector issues are largely governance issues. “Raising energy prices alone cannot resolve energy issues,” it said.
Large infrastructure projects must be shifted to public–private partnership mode to reduce the burden on the budget.

2,World Bank okays nearly $150m loan,"Includes $78m for digital economy enhancement, $71.7m for barrage upscale","The World Bank has approved nearly $150 million in loans for two projects, including $72 million in additional funding for a scheme plagued by delays and loan cancellations.
The Board of Directors of the World Bank approved the Digital Economy Enhancement Project costing $78 million amid a ban on the use of X platform in Pakistan. The Washington-based lender also approved additional financing of $71.7 million for the Sindh Barrages Improvement Project, according to a press statement issued by the WB local office.
“The catastrophic floods that hit Pakistan in 2022 were a tragic reminder of the importance of building resilience to such disasters, including by strengthening barrages and their management,” said Najy Benhassine, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.
He stressed that supporting the growing digital economy in Pakistan is crucial for economic and social development, broadening connectivity, and providing access to government and financial services for citizens and entrepreneurs, particularly women.
Pakistan has taken the $78 million loan to enhance the government’s capacity for digitally enabled public service delivery for citizens and businesses. The project will facilitate digital transactions initiated by individuals to access public and private sector services.
The World Bank and the government are collaborating to deepen digital service delivery at a time when there is a ban on the use of X, formally Twitter. The government has not provided any justification for placing unannounced restrictions on the use of the microblogging website.
The Digital Economy Enhancement Project (DEEP) will develop digital authentication and data-sharing platforms to enable Pakistan to respond more effectively and efficiently to shocks, deliver better e-government services to citizens and firms, and support regulatory reforms in the sector, including enabling greater private participation and strengthening personal data protection and online safety, according to the project documents.
The project will also promote financial inclusion by enabling women, in particular, to open bank accounts or apply remotely for credit through a smartphone application. It will also address barriers such as limited mobility and digital literacy.
Of the $78 million, $5 million or 6.4% of the total project cost will be spent on setting up a project management unit.
“The digital economy and demand for digital government services have been growing across the country, increasing the need for connectivity, digital payments, and secure and trusted digital transactions,” said Shan Rehman, task team leader for the project.
The World Bank highlighted that Pakistan lags on most digital development rankings relative to regional comparators, particularly on digital infrastructure connectivity, digital government, and the enabling environment for the digital economy. It underscored the need to ensure that the use and reuse of data are not unduly restricted through data localisation requirements.
Despite the availability of policy instruments at the federal and provincial levels, the responsible institutions lack adequate implementation capacity, resulting in missed opportunities across various subsectors.
Federal and provincial government agencies have rolled out some digital services, though they remain limited. These services vary in degree of maturity and often lack key elements such as interoperability, privacy and security by design, secure and inclusive identity authentication for transactions done remotely, and limited integration between federal and provincial IT systems.
The World Bank approved $71.7 million as second additional financing for the Sindh Barrages Improvement Project to support the full completion and commissioning of the Guddu and Sukkur barrages rehabilitation works and improve the management of three barrages in Sindh including Guddu, Sukkur, and Kotri.
The project documents stated that the rehabilitation of Guddu and Sukkur barrages have suffered significant delays due to several factors, including procurement delays due to bidder complaints resulting in court-ordered stay orders, delays in securing the contractor’s campsite and the right-of-way, change in the method of rehabilitation.
In 2021, the World Bank had cancelled a $30 million loan component at the request of Pakistan due to savings from exchange rate gains at that time. In the same year, Pakistan and the World Bank also agreed to cancel another $78.5 million loan for the project.
The World Bank stated that the additional financing will close a funding gap caused by a previous partial cancellation of the original credit and cost changes. The additional loan also comes with a restructuring of the parent project. The project completion period has been extended by four years to June 2028.
The project objectives, scope, and implementation arrangements remain unchanged, and there will be continuity of the World Bank’s safeguards policy, said the World Bank.

3,India extends ban on onion exports,Traders anticipated lifting of ban as local prices have more than halved since export restrictions were implemented,"India has extended its ban on onion exports indefinitely – a surprise move that comes ahead of a general election and is set to exacerbate high prices in some overseas markets.
Imposed by India – the world’s biggest exporter of the vegetable – in December, the ban was due to expire on March 31. Traders had anticipated it would be lifted as local prices have more than halved since the export restrictions were implemented and this season’s crop is yielding fresh supplies. However, the government issued an order late on Friday that the ban will remain in place until further notice.
“The extension is surprising and completely unnecessary, considering the falling prices with rising supplies from the new season crop,” said an executive at a Mumbai-based export firm, who declined to be identified.

4,PSX rises gradually in topsy-turvy week,"KSE-100 index gains 335 points, or 0.5% WoW, settles at 65,152","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) made gradual progress in the outgoing week as it added nearly 350 points to its tally, but could not cross the resistance level of 66,000.
The market remained volatile throughout the week with a mix of positive moves and profit-taking at higher stock valuations. At the beginning of the week, caution prevailed when market players awaited the announcement of monetary policy.
However, the staff-level agreement between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) following last review under the $3 billion standby arrangement (SBA) provided a boost to the bourse.
Similarly, the surplus in Pakistan’s current account balance and increase in the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) foreign currency reserves were other major positives for the market.
On the other hand, foreign direct investment in the country slowed down during the first eight months of the current fiscal year, which deterred some investors from building their positions.
Day-to-day performance of the PSX shows that on Monday it experienced a modest recovery, fuelled by anticipation surrounding the SBP’s monetary policy announcement and optimism about the IMF’s final review under the SBA.
Next day, the KSE-100 index extended its gains and surged over 600 points following military strikes on terrorist hideouts and announcement of monetary policy where the SBP kept the policy rate unchanged.
On Wednesday, stocks continued their bull-run for the third successive day as the IMF and Islamabad reached a staff-level agreement under the $3 billion SBA.
The bourse gave up earlier gains following profit-taking on Thursday, snapping the three-day bullish streak. On the last trading day of the week, the PSX succumbed to selling pressure and extended losses by more than 250 points.
At close of the topsy-turvy week, the benchmark KSE-100 index gained 335 points, or 0.52% week-on-week (WoW), and settled at 65,151.83.
JS Global Deputy Head of Research Muhammad Waqas Ghani, in his report, stated that the market experienced volatility throughout the week, with the initial three sessions concluding positively before profit-taking dominated the final two sessions.

“The focal point during the week was the IMF’s conclusive assessment of the $3 billion SBA, marked by the signing of a staff-level agreement,” he said, adding that the newly elected government reaffirmed its commitment to meeting all the structural benchmarks and indicative targets set forth by the IMF. Another notable event was the SBP’s monetary policy statement, where it opted to maintain the policy rate at 22% for the fifth consecutive time, since July 2023. For the decision, the SBP cited the current high inflation rate and the inflation outlook leaning towards unfavourable risks, despite recent disinflationary trends.
According to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the large-scale manufacturing sector posted an increase of 1.8% year-on-year (YoY) in January 2024, making a positive growth for the second consecutive month.
Furthermore, in T-bills’ auction, cut-off yields jumped in the range of 20.9 to 21.7 basis points for papers of different maturities, the JS analyst added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) wrote, in its report, that the market remained mixed in the beginning since investors adopted a careful stance as they awaited the monetary policy announcement. Following the announcement of unchanged policy rate and signing of a staff-level agreement with the IMF, the market sentiment revived.
The current account recorded a surplus of $128 million in February 2024, compared to a deficit of $303 million in January. Additionally, the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves climbed up $105 million.
Foreign direct investment declined by 17% YoY in 8MFY24, reaching $821 million.
Foreign buying continued during the week under review, clocking in at $2 million compared to net buying of $2.7 million last week, AHL added.

7,Govt to offer OGDCL shares to Gulf investors,"Pakistan hopes to get better price from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Kuwait","Pakistan’s government is expected to ask friendly nations to invest in the country’s largest hydrocarbon explorer – Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) – in order to fetch a better price for the company.
Background discussions with officials privy to the development revealed that Pakistan could offer shares of the state-owned company to friendly countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar, which may offer attractive prices. Earlier, the strategy to divest the shareholding in OGDCL on the stock market had led to a sharp fall in share prices of the company.
Stockbrokers allegedly manipulated the OGDCL shares prices that fell to Rs117 per share from Rs216 when the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government floated the company’s stocks in 2014. On November 8, 2014, the government scrapped the OGDCL’s transaction after international and domestic institutional investors subscribed to only half of the shares offered to them.
The government floated 311 million shares at a minimum price of Rs216 per share, but it received offers for only 162 million shares, or 52% of the total offer, at the conclusion of a three-day bidding process.
In February 2020, the Petroleum Division asked the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCOP) to stop the OGDCL divestment process because of a steep fall in the company’s share price. The stock recovered slightly to Rs123.76, which was still 42% below the 2014 level of Rs216, when the PML-N government attempted to sell a stake in the company.
The CCOP had decided in August 2019 to divest up to 7% government shares in the company.
Read PSO keen on OGDCL, Mari Petroleum shares
Officials point out that the experiment of selling shares on the stock market had failed in the past and now the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) is striving to bring investors from different countries, especially Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE.
If the government wants to sell its shares, it should search for strategic partner countries to fetch a better price as well as investment in OGDCL, they said.
Sources added that OGDCL had also been trapped in circular debt for a long time as its clients were unable to clear their outstanding dues, which could hurt plans for future investment in the company.
They urged the new government of PML-N to take immediate steps to address the circular debt issue, which would improve cash flow and encourage the company to expand oil and gas drilling activities.
Last month, the CCOP took up the matter again for divesting shares in OGDCL. It was proposed that the stake should be transferred back to the Petroleum Division from the Privatisation Commission (PC) as its sell-off did not materialise.
The CCOP, in its meeting held on May 21, 2021, had approved the proposal of the Petroleum Division which asked for not offloading the OGDCL shares. The federal cabinet ratified the CCOP decision on June 8, 2021.
PC receives dividends from its shareholding in OGDCL (322.46 million shares), when the company board announces payouts.
The dividend income is regularly sent to the Finance Division and so far approximately Rs21.49 billion has been remitted while Rs1.40 billion is lying with the PC.
Furthermore, the commission, from time to time, had been requesting the Petroleum Division to take over OGDCL shares, in light of CCOP’s decision of May 21, 2021.
The Petroleum Division, in a letter written on November 6, 2023, consented that OGDCL shares, which were in the name of PC, could be transferred to the division as divestment had not been allowed by the CCOP.
The PC board, in its meeting held on December 12, 2023, decided that approval of the CCOP may be sought for transferring OGDCL shares from the PC’s Central Depository Company (CDC) account to the Petroleum Division.
During the ensuing discussion, it was observed that OGDCL had been included in the Sovereign Wealth Fund, thus it would be appropriate not to transfer its shares to the Petroleum Division, as at some stage the shareholding would need to be transferred to the wealth fund.
An alternative view was that shares may be given to the Petroleum Division and the same, along with other shares of the company, may be transferred to the wealth fund, as and when required. It was suggested that the advice of the Law and Justice Division may be sought to enable the CCOP to make an informed decision.
The CCOP considered the summary submitted by the Ministry of Privatisation titled “Transfer of Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) shares lying with Privatisation Commission to the Petroleum Division” and directed the Ministry of Privatisation to seek legal opinion from the law ministry.

8,Curbing illicit tobacco trade: a key IMF condition,"It will generate more revenue, raise tax-to-GDP ratio","Experts have suggested that Pakistan has a strategic opportunity to meet conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), enhance tax collection and significantly increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by curbing illicit trade in the tobacco sector.
Recently, the IMF recommended that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) should apply a uniform excise duty to all locally manufactured cigarettes, regardless of the manufacturer’s origin, to generate additional revenue.
However, the total tax collection from the tobacco sector comes from just two legal companies, while the FBR has completely failed to bring the illicit cigarette manufacturers to the tax net.
With the potential to enhance annual revenue from the tobacco industry to Rs600 billion, up from the current Rs250 billion, cracking down on the illicit tobacco trade is seen as a crucial step. This move aligns with the government’s ambition to elevate the tax-to-GDP ratio to 20% and address Pakistan’s economic challenges more effectively.

“Curbing the illicit tobacco trade is not just about revenue; it is also about meeting IMF conditions and strengthening Pakistan’s economic resilience. This initiative can significantly contribute to enhancing the tax collection and improving the tax-to-GDP ratio,” said Osama Siddiqui, a microeconomic analyst.
Recent industry data has highlighted a rise in the market share of illicit cigarettes to 63%, underscoring the urgency of action. The disparity caused by higher prices of legal cigarettes has driven consumers towards cheaper, untaxed alternatives, resulting in a loss of Rs310 billion in tax revenue.
He added that addressing the illicit tobacco trade was not just a fiscal necessity but also a strategic move to fund infrastructure development, healthcare and education.
“By taking decisive steps to combat this issue, Pakistan can pave the way for economic growth, meet international obligations and secure vital resources for national development.”
