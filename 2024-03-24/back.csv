0,Lost pages of history,Dr Farooq Adil sparks reflection on political shifts and economic struggles from partition to modern times,"It is said that one should learn lessons from history. Unfortunately, however, Pakistan as a nation seems to have failed to learn its lesson, though in our case history has been repeated time and again. We seem to have forgotten a lot of things that should have taught us to do much better than we have. It is a misfortune that in our country a lot of facts have been distorted through the years or not presented as they actually happened, as if not presenting them to the younger generation truthfully would erase them from history. Though one should remember that facts associated with history can neither perish nor be erased or modified. Perhaps this is why it is said that one should cast an eye back into the past, as with the passage of time, some new explanation and interpretation of the historic events often come to light.
Dr Farooq Adil’s book Hum Nay Jo Bhula Dia: Tareeq-i-Pakistan Kay Gumshuda Auraq (What We Have Forgotten: The Lost Pages of Pakistan’s History) — a collection of his articles that were published on the BBC Urdu website—revisits Pakistan’s history in an attempt to understand it in a clearer light.
Dr Adil is a senior journalist and columnist and has been associated with many reputable organisations. Though he has never been active as a politician, he has deep political knowledge and at one point worked as consultant to Mamnoon Hussain, the late former President of Pakistan.
In his articles, the author has narrated the various aspects of the important events that took place in Pakistan since its establishment in 1947. The book moves era wise, starting from what went wrong in Kashmir after the Partition detailing the participation of the tribal militants in Kashmir and the role of the
state in it, to the ouster of the first government to seek US aid, the hurdles placed in the country’s path to development due to repeated change of command in the 1950s, to the first martial law imposed in Pakistan along with the background and behind-the-scenes conspiracies, to the formation and ouster of democratic governments of Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, and a lot that happened in between and after.
The initial hiccups faced by the new nation were not just the formation of government and the settlement of refugees that came in hoards. Karachi was declared the federal capital, which raised problems of establishing the secretariat as the federal government refused to set up its offices in Malir which was quite far from the main city and where the provincial government claimed there were many suitable buildings from the WWII days.
Then came the problem of residences for government officials. Contrary to the common belief that the bureaucracy was content to live in tents and burnt houses, citing Hameeda Khuro, Dr Adil writes that it was not the case. For example, Finance Minister Ghulam Muhammad reluctantly accepted a bungalow as it was not on the main road, and was also not happy that his son-in-law did not get a residence that matched his standards.
Dr Adil also writes that Ayub Khuro was not in favour of the people coming in from India to settle permanently in Karachi. While in other parts of the country, the land was permanently transferred in the buyer’s name, here a rule was made according to which land was given on 30, 40, or 99-year lease.
Despite Pakistan being an agricultural country, from time to time, it has faced shortages of wheat which is a staple of most Pakistanis. In early 1953, severe wheat shortage hit the country because of various factors, including mismanagement, forced acquisition of wheat from farmers, and lack of proper policy; it is also mentioned that wheat was smuggled to Afghanistan through NWFP (now KP). To tackle the shortage, rationing was introduced; the scheme too faced problems as the issuance of fake ration cards began. Dr Adil writes that it was announced that bakeries would be issued special ration cards and they would have the responsibility to provide cooked rotis to the people. How serious the government was can be gauged from the fact that the first project for Pakki Pakai roti [ready-cooked flatbread] was
introduced during the Bhutto era.
Citing Pir Ali Mohammed Rashdi, Dr Adil writes that Governor General Ghulam Mohammed was distressed due to financial issues facing the country those days, and in order to get US aid a few pacts, such as SETO and the Baghdad Pact, had to be signed with America, under which Pakistan committed to fight against communism.
While the American food aid that started in 1953 helped Pakistan overcome food shortage and strengthen economy and defence, America also benefitted from it gaining political, economic, and defence benefits. To achieve these aims it effected government changes in Pakistan and used various means to improve US popularity among Pakistani masses.
Taking the readers back in time, the author writes about the way the first President of Pakistan, Iskandar Mirza, was exiled, the dissolution of the first Constituent Assembly, the formation of One-Unit, and the ill-planned operations such as Operation Gibraltar and Operation Grand Slam and the mystery behind them before the 1965 war with India.
The importance of Gwadar for Pakistan in present times cannot be denied as it has now been developed as a major port. However, few people are aware of its history and how it was acquired by Pakistan. At the time of its acquisition, then Prime Minister Feroz khan Noon told the nation through the Parliament that Sultan of Oman had given the area to Pakistan free of cost as a goodwill gesture. However, a few days later, Time magazine revealed that Gwadar was not given as a goodwill gesture but the land had been acquired at a cost of Rs42 million.
After the 1965 war, leaders of India and Pakistan met in Tashkent to resolve the differences between the two nations. What happened in Tashkent is contrary to what was published in the newspapers back then. Dr Adil writes that the Pakistan delegation was ill-prepared for talks and did not prioritise the inclusion of Kashmir issue which India refused to do. Though at one point, President Ayub asked the Soviet prime minister to include resolution of Kashmir issue. In reply the Soviet prime minister
reminded him that the Pakistan foreign minister had earlier agreed that Kashmir issue would not hold a conclusive place in the talks.
Ayub Khan’s early years are said to be a period of development and prosperity. But as they say even good things come to an end and so did Ayub’s popularity. The reasons for his downfall are varied, but interestingly the rise in prices of items of daily use especially sugar proved to be the culminating point. During the same time, students began nation-wide protests. The death of a student during these added fuel to the fire, with politicians, especially Bhutto, taking advantage of it. The ensuing unrest throughout the country ended in Yahya Khan taking over the reins.
There is a detailed account of pandemonium in the Dhaka Assembly, in 1958, which resulted in the death of the Deputy Speaker; the chaos had started when objection was raised to the presence of non-members in the assembly hall. They were MPAs but under the rules their membership should have ended as they had recently been inducted as government lawyers. However, just a day before, the president had passed an ordinance which allowed government lawyers to retain their assembly seats. It is said that the president had passed the ordinance so as to retain their membership as otherwise Muslim League would have lost the majority in the East Pakistan assembly. This shows that since
the early days, rules were changed to gain advantages or suppress opposition. This incident is also cited as one the reasons for the first martial law in the country.
What led to the separation of East Pakistan and creation of Bangladesh is not given much place in our history books. However, Hum Nay Jo Bhula Dia discusses the situation in detail.
We read about the political situation, the treatment meted out to the Bengalis, the neglect of and discrimination against East Pakistan by West Pakistan, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s six points and their rejection, the agitation in East Pakistan and the army’s role, the blocking of and misleading information and news censorship, and the eventual break-up of the country.
On October 1, 1980, Pakistanis, waiting to hear Gen Zia’s speech in the UN General Assembly, were pleasantly surprised when they heard Qari Shakir Qasmi reciting a verse from the Quran before Gen Zia’s speech. Dr Adil writes that it was the work of PTV which merged two shots to appear as if people in the assembly hall were listening to Qari Shakir’s tilawat, though in fact the speaker preceding Gen Zia was still speaking. Another version to this is that Gen Zia had a small tape recorder in his pocket and switched it on as he reached the rostrum.
Many other events of historic importance have been discussed in detail such as the MRD movement and the government’s failure to suppress it and how its leaders ended it suddenly after Indian
prime minister tried to use it for their advantage.
During the mid-1993, the nation witnessed a tussle between President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, resulting in the dissolution and restoration of the Assembly and finally the exit of both Nawaz Sharif and President Ishaq Khan.
One reads with interest the minute-by-minute description of Gen Musharraf’s military coup, wherein, to some, it may come as a surprise that the coup was not a reaction of his ouster but had been given a thought, rather planned, before the attempt at ouster.
There is a touching account of the unceremonious exit of an elected president, Rafiq Tarar. This brings to light how the Martial Law administrators manipulate things through PCOs to their advantage. The president wanted it to be on record that he had not resigned and, hence, refused any farewell ceremony. He did not even respond to Gen Musarraf’s salute as he left the President House.
The last chapter of the book reveals how most of our leaders/rulers are in the habit of visiting spiritual men and shrines, and that it is not a new trend. From Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad’s inclination towards a ‘baba’ in Ajmer and Zardari’s reliance on a particular Pir and Benazir visiting durgahs [tombs and shrines of Muslim saints] and spiritual men to Imran Khan believing in kala jadu [black magic] and relying on a spiritual adviser all seem to have depended on spirituality to rule the
country.
The book is written in an easy-to-follow manner, yet shows the author’s observation, study and analysis. He has presented the facts as well as criticism with any bias or humiliating anyone. To
give authenticity to the facts stated, the author has cited references from various books and newspapers. The book can prove to be a treasure trove for those who want to keep an eye on
the political developments in the country.

1,Building bridges at iftar,One school’s initiative to celebrating faith and unity and breaking bread together can promote religious tolerance,"Last week, St Patrick’s School in Karachi took the commendable initiative to celebrate St Patrick’s Feast Day by organising an iftar dinner for their Muslim staff. March 17, is believed to be the Saint’s death anniversary, and celebrated as a Feast Day. Saint Patrick was a Christian missionary and bishop in Ireland during the fifth century. But this year wasn’t the first time Father Mario Roderiques, the Principal of St Patrick’s organised the celebration of Ramadan and St Patrick’s day feast together.
“Previously, I have done the same in various parishes,” shares the Reverand Father who belongs to the Archdiocese of Karachi, and was ordained as a priest in 1990. “When I was St Jude&#39;s, our church was in the centre of an all-Muslim community. When I decided to host an iftar dinner for them, I was shocked by the response. The neighbours were extremely excited about it and it was an excellent turnout. People came in big numbers, including the maulanas from the nearby mosques. With Ramazan and Lent falling together since the last three or four years, I thought why not have an interfaith celebration again.”
The overlap
Since 2022, the Christian Lent has overlapped with Ramazan. Those who didn’t study in a missionary school or don’t live close to the Christian community, might wonder what Lent is.
Lent is a 40-day period of preparation and penance preceding Easter, during which, Christians are encouraged to fast, pray, and engage in acts of charity as a way of preparing themselves for the celebration of Easter, while Ramazan is a time for increased spirituality and purification. Despite their disparities, both practices facilitate a deeper connection with God for those who observe them. Distinct in their purposes and rituals, yet both Ramazan and Lent offer individuals a chance to enhance their spiritual bonds and draw nearer to their faith.
Focus on shared values
While Ramazan is about fasting and abstinence from food, drink, physical intimacy, etc., Lent is a meditation on the sacrifices, crucifixion, resurrection and divinity of Jesus Christ. The 30-day fast is obligatory for all Muslims, while most branches of the Christianity call for observing the 40-day Lent. Underlying these events are basic tenets and commonalities that find a common ground.
The Quran teaches us as Muslims to find “common terms with the People of the Book (i.e., Jews and Christians), and reiterates that we worship only one God.” It is comforting to know that there are core doctrines behind Ramazan and Lent. Both teach piety and self-introspection or meditation during the period, in an effort to cleanse the self from sin and evil thoughts.
For Muslims, the itekaf entails time in solitude at the mosque and the reading of the Quran and Hadees. At this point, how can we negate the message of patience and humility from Jesus Christ, known to Muslim as Hazrat Eesa AS, one of our revered prophets, who was endowed with healing powers and miracles. The two faiths were founded by the Prophet Abraham (Hazrat Ibrahim AS), and both are aimed at salvation from hell. The Jesus of the Quran has a reference in ninety-three verses, which is more than any other prophet, apart from Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). The Quranic account of Jesus’ life harmonises with the Gospels in more particulars than even many Muslims realise.
Millions of Muslims are named after Jesus and Mary — we call them Isa and Mariam and it is done out of love because you don’t name your kids after people you don’t like! So believing in Jesus is an absolute requirement and if you don’t believe in him, you’re automatically not a Muslim. According to the Hadees, Jesus was assumed into heaven, and will return at the end of time in the east of Damascus, his hands resting on the shoulders of two angels. When it sees him, the Antichrist will dissolve like salt in water, and Jesus will rule the earth for forty years. In the Quran’s fourth Surah, verse 157: “They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him.”
The Quran mentions twenty-five prophets, and nearly all of them are familiar from the Bible: Adam and Noah, Moses and Abraham, David and Solomon, Lot and Job, John the Baptist — all messengers of God. Both Lent and Ramadan emphasise the importance of self-discipline, sacrifice, and spiritual reflection. Both observances encourage individuals to engage in acts of charity and to seek forgiveness for their sins and also serve as reminders of the importance of community and unity, as individuals come together to celebrate and support each other during these periods of observance.
Islam and Christianity teach self-sacrifice, with Christians recalling the suffering of Christ and Muslims remembering the mission of Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) to free the Meccans from the shackles of idolatry and polytheism.
When the Muslims give zakat in Ramazan, it is a reminder that the rich and poor, are equal before the eyes of God (Allah). When Ramazan culminates into Eid-ul-Fitr festivities, those who have fasted and endured the hardship are compared to having become as pure as a newborn baby, who has no sins to his account. Similarly, Lent ends with Easter Sunday, and the feast of the Resurrection celebrates a new life in Christ.
The similarities between the observance of Lent and Ramazan, can inspire people to engage in academic and constructive discussions. This could perhaps contribute to the ongoing pursuit of tolerance and harmony among people, ultimately alleviating global tensions and distrust fuelled by extremists, orthodox thinking and acts of violence such as suicide bombings and false accusations by misinterpreting the blasphemy law.
Once upon a time
This time of year, as I am surrounded by the observances of Ramazan and Lent, my mind goes back to my childhood in PECHS, Block E, Karachi, in the 70s, where our street had a few Christian families living. In the upper portion of the house right across us lived Muggo’s family. Muggo was Margaret, a spritely 20-something I used to think the world of. She was attractive, had lovely straight her that moved with her animated head. She always smiled at us as she went in her office van early in the morning as my dad drove us off for school. On Sundays, dressed in smart skirts and shoes, she and her elderly mother and elder sister left for church, their heads draped in wispy chiffon scarves.
Peering at them through our window, my mother taught us what ‘Sunday best’ meant. Next door to them lived little mean Maureen, who was differently-abled. We played pittu and hide and seek together with other kids in the street, until her mean streak came alive and disrupted our playtime. Then a few blocks away was Shirley, a dark girl with lots of long, thick hair and dazzling smiles for us. She too whizzed off in her office van early in the morning and returned in the evening when we were playing in the street or hanging in our balconies, chomping on bubble-gum, as we waited for the other kids to appear.
And then how could I not think of my bestie Sandra Cordeiro in the government officer’s colony at Garden Road, Karachi, where we lived in the late 70s and early 80s. We hung out a lot at each other’s houses. At her house was better because Sandra had three elder sisters Joan, Jackie, Eva. Their brother Alan would be busy driving the sisters back and forth or fiddling with his copper coloured Dodge Dart or strumming his guitar. Dino, their dog would join us off and on as we listened to music, ate innumerable sandwiches, or cycled around the colony. Mr Cordiero worked for some elevator company while Dr/Mrs Cordeiro was the civil surgeon and must have looked down our throats and give us unpalatable mixtures a million times, at the civil surgeon’s office where now stand the barracks of the Sindh Secretariate.
Ofcourse Christmas and Easter were duly celebrated and Sandra appeared at our washed and scrubbed and in a new dress and string of pearls. A vast difference from her usual messy appearance and patent slacks and tee. The cookies and cakes that were sent to our house, we thought, were far more exciting than the sevaiyan, haleem or halwa that was sent from ours to them for Eid, Moharram and Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi respectively. But Sandra and her dad thought differently as they devoured the plate of halwa in minutes. The closeness, and camaderie that we shared was so uncontrived, so casual as though there wasn’t any other way to be. They were them and we were us and that’s how it was meant to be. Nobody even thought about, let alone speak of belonging to different faiths. Being there for each other mattered most and that is all there was to it, an easy, weightless feeling. I have lost touch with most of these lovely people as they immigrated abroad, but I do hope to find them on social media someday soon.
A confused nation
“The only way we can promote interfaith harmony is by encouraging activities that help our relations with each other,” says Father Mario. “We should let go of the negative elements and start talking positive. Let’s focus on becoming better Pakistanis, not just better Muslims, and better Christians. I also feel that as a society, we have lost our nationalist spirit which must be developed among us again. We have to feel that we are proud to be Pakistani. That is the most important thing.”
Presently, a mix of communities reside together in only in the older areas of the cities and towns, not the newer areas, where there is not much mingling among people of different faiths. Overall, the society is more Saudi influenced, than core Pakistani, many of imagine we are Turks. What is certain that we are not what we used to be. “All human beings are important to me,” says Father Mario, beaming at his students who performed a series of skits around interfaith harmony and beautifully recited hymns and naats, before the iftar dinner began. “I hope I continue and am able to serve the people, and when I say people, I don’t mean only Christians.
But he agrees that our society has become intolerant and polarised since the time of General Zia. “But this makes it even more important to promote good will between people belonging to different religious communities. Prior to Zia’s time, this division wasn’t present at all inthe communities whether you were a Muslim or Christian or Hindu orParsi. This change has happened since then. We were all an equal partof Pakistan, practically living in each other&#39;s houses. For Christmas,everybody would live in my house most of the time, for Easter, it wasthe same, and for Eid, I would be in their house. There was a lot ofmingling and mixing and nobody felt threatened or insecure. Everybodyhad their own faith to follow, others respected that. And that isharmony.”

3,Code blue and contemplation,"Fear, desperation, hope and ethics, the poetry is a glimpse into chaotic human drama, through the eyes of a doctor","In this journey, I’m not just an observer, I’m an active participant. My stories aren't clinical case studies detached from the soul, they are my soul's way of understanding the world, painted through the visceral medium of poetry.
With each poem, I delve into the diverse facets of emergency medicine, navigating the complex emotions, ethical challenges, and philosophical questions that define its terrain. This collection is more than just a series of poems to me. It’s a part of my quest to understand humanity, to feel deeply, and to connect with the essence of emergency care.
Through my words, I invite you to see the world through my eyes, to feel the pulse of life in the adrenaline rush of the Emergency Room (ER), and to join me in this deeply personal exploration. It's a call that goes beyond the surface, asking not just for reflection, but for a shared journey into empathy and action.
This is not just an invitation, it's a glimpse into the heart of what it means to heal and be healed. It challenges us, you and me, to look beyond the clinical and embrace the deeply humane side of healing.

In the dim light of dawn, I witness a child’s battle come to an end, not in victory, but in silence. For me, this is neither the first time nor will it be the last. The moment, captured in “C’est La Vie” below, is a stark reminder of the raw reality I daily face in emergency medicine. Through my words, my poem serves as a prelude, inviting us to confront life’s precariousness and the profound impact of loss on those who bear witness, be it family or healthcare providers in the ER.
C’est La Vie
Walked into the ER, dawn's light barely there,
A five-year-old boy, life hanging by a thread.
Fourth time they tried to bring him back since night,
Diphtheria's grip tight, a battle fought in vain.
 
8:05, silence fell, my shift just starting,
Life's fragility echoing off sterile walls.
""Wasted potential,"" a phrase that lingers,
His journey short, his words unspoken, a friend muses.
 
Stepped outside for air, the weight unbearable,
His family, a picture of despair, their world shattered.
Tears, maybe a brief solace in their overwhelming grief,
A stark reminder of the paths we all walk, alone yet together.
 
Years in the ER, you think you'd be prepared,
Yet, each loss, each farewell cuts deep, leaves a mark.
The lesson consummates in its simplicity: cherish those you love,
Hold them close, for in the end, that's all we truly have.
 
And so is life, a series of hellos and goodbyes,
A reminder of our vulnerabilities, of loves lost and found,
In the somber quiet, a call to embrace every moment,
For in its fleeting nature lies the essence of our being.
Through the above lines, I share the essence of emergency care — a realm where every minute may be a fight for life, and every decision a weight carried by those committed to saving others.
***
As the night unfolds, ""Friday Night Shift"" becomes a mirror to my own internal tempests, the ones I navigate as an emergency physician. This poem speaks to my soul, laying bare the turmoil and burnout that lurk beneath the surface, all set against the cacophony of my ER, made worse by a storm ravaging Karachi by night. 
Friday Night Shift
Driving home, the echo of the ER's crazy Friday night rings loud.
Storm outside, a mirror to the tempest within—
Kids in need, no beds to send them to, parents in despair, the relentless dance of life and death.
""I think I'm done,"" says Inner Voice, ""my clinical ER days might be numbered,"" the weight of it all a heavy shroud.
 
Then, a father by ER bed 2, his life entwined with his toddler's leukaemia battle,
Offers an unsolicited glimpse into my soul.
""You've changed,"" he declares, a keen observer from the shadows.
Ten months of unwitting observation, now he notes my faded zeal, my altered presence.
 
He mentions my weight loss, my unkempt hair—signs of a shift within.
""Where's the oomph?"" He probes, missing the firm leader he once saw.
This man, a banker by trade, with a psychologist’s keen eye,
Shares his story, a year past, his kid’s diagnosis through Friday chaos, his own world upended.
 
His journey from denial to acceptance in that same ER, guided by blunt truth,
Reflects back on me. His concern, laden with genuine worry,
For he saw in me what I've yet to see.
A mirror held up, not in judgment, but in connection.
 
His words, more than a casual remark, a significant nudge,
A wake-up call amidst the frenzy, signalling a deeper sign.
The ER, a crucible of harsh lessons, yet also of profound human touch.
Tonight, it whispers of change, of rekindled purpose, of why we endure.
 
Carrying his observation, a beacon through my introspection,
A reminder of the storm we brave, of the sparks we kindle in its wrath.
""It's a sign,"" Inner Voice muses, clearer now in its contemplation.
A call not just to persevere, but to reimagine, rediscover, reinvent.
***
As the above drama played out, I found myself drawn into my own intimate reflections — a healthcare professional wrestling with the relentless demands of his calling. This poem mirrors my journey from the shadow of doubt to the light of rediscovery, serving as a testament to the resilience required to navigate existential trials in ERs. This isn't just another of my ER stories told in verse; it's a revelation of my own struggle, my own search for meaning amidst the chaos within and without.

Diving deeper into my own experiences, ""Fragments of the Mind"" becomes a journey through the layers of the human psyche that emergency settings so starkly expose. This poem turns into a personal dialogue, where I confront the vulnerabilities and strengths that mental health crises reveal. It's as if each verse speaks directly to me, reflecting the raw and unfiltered essence of what it means to stand on the front lines of ‘mind-brain’ fragility and resilience.
Fragments of the Mind
In the glaring light of the ER, as night unwinds its complex tales, 
The unfiltered essence of the human psyche emerges, stark and unveiled. 
A young girl stands in defiance, her battle not with the world but with her own shadows, 
Choosing bleach over food, her silent rebellion echoes through the hollows.
 
A young man, his conviction in his own mythos, takes a leap, not from folly but belief, 
Finds himself impaled, where reality and fantasy meet, a junction of grief. 
His ordeal, more than an accident, a confrontation with his own mortality, 
A harsh lesson in the limits of human frailty.
 
The scene shifts to a gurney, now a stage for unbridled mania to play, 
A young soul strips himself naked, daring the world to see him fray. 
His challenge, a raw display of vulnerability and defiance, 
A poignant testament to the mind's unchecked alliance with chaos.
 
Amidst the turmoil, a pregnant woman's voice cuts through, a tempest of words, 
Cursing in Urdu, invoking mothers and sisters, each utterance sharp as swords. 
Her reality, fragmented by the use of street drugs, spirals into despair, 
Revealing a lineage of care, distressingly laid bare.
 
These nights in the ER, where psyche's battles unfold, 
Not just with medical interventions, but with stories untold. 
Haldol and Ativan serve as temporary reprieves, 
Yet, beneath the surface, a tapestry of human emotion weaves.
 
Thus, through each shift, lesson upon lesson we compile, 
In the heart of the ER, humanity's trials. 
Each encounter, a fragment of a larger story, a sign 
We bear witness to the resilience of the spirit, divine. 
***
In the above narratives, I witnessed shared psychological struggles of both patients and caregivers against unseen challenges transcending the ER's confines. This mutual journey illuminates our collective resilience against adversity, revealing a deep bond formed through trials encountered both within and beyond the hospital ER’s walls.
***
Expanding the vista, ""Echoes Across Continents"" bridges my individual experiences with the collective heartbeat of emergency medicine around the world. Encountering child abuse within the ER is a stark, global reality that I face regularly. When the story of an abused child in the ER resonates with my own experiences, the pain intensifies. To truly heal, we must move beyond mere words to tangible actions. Therefore, my poem reflects our shared mission and the universal challenges we face, reminding us that the quest to heal our children knows no borders nor time.
Echoes Across Continents
Fifteen years of split worlds, five Stateside, then ten where Indus unfurls. 
In ERs, under different stars, I've borne witness to young lives, 
A morning in turmoil, a boy of ten, his innocence questioned, 
Brought under harsh lights, a story of rape, starkly laid bare. 
It's not the first tale of darkness I've heard, 
Nor, I fear, the last, each narrative a heavy burden.
 
In these corridors, both near and far, a similar pain resonates, 
Children entangled in distress beyond their understanding. 
Their eyes, wide, hold untold stories, 
Reflecting my own history, my own choices taken from me.
 
The cook's shadow looms large over my silent years, 
A trust broken; a secret kept through unshed tears. 
At ten, I, too, was lost, with no words to say, 
What happened in the dark, in the light of day?
 
Now, as a kids’ ER doctor, I stand in this breach, 
Across continents, it's their trust I seek to reach. 
From USA's advanced halls to Pakistan's resilient walls, 
I carry their stories, a weight we all bear.
 
This isn't just about draining wounds or setting bones right, 
It's about hearing their silence, fighting their fight. 
Fifteen years in, and the journey feels new, 
Each child's gaze, a reminder of the work left to do.
 
The ER shouldn't be where these stories unfold, 
No child should through these doors, their nightmares told. 
Yet, here we are, in spaces filled with fluorescent light, 
Holding their hands, ready to fight their fight.
 
In this role, I've found a voice, perhaps, 
To speak for those whose pain is masked. 
Across continents, under different skies, 
We're united in this mission, until no child's voice dies.
***
Beyond the Break
In the still moments between alarms, 
where urgency and hope find their fragile balance, 
we confront the quiet aftermath, the echoes of sudden stillness. 
Bodies recount tales of sudden stops, 
each injury a narrative of life interrupted, managed in the ER's glare.
 
Within these walls, questions hang heavy in the air, 
how to knit together lives unravelled by trauma, 
in environments where comprehensive care barely glimmers?
 
Our hands, marked by fatigue, craft resilience stitch by stitch, 
each effort a stand against despair, 
a pledge to those swept up in unforeseen calamities. 
Yet, in the grip of grave injuries and survival's faint whisper, 
we face decisions shrouded in the gravity of *DNR [do not resuscitate], 
a sobering choice in lands without the safety net of comprehensive healthcare, 
where the burden of rehabilitation's cost casts a long shadow.
 
Here, amid daunting odds, our roles expand, 
embracing the solemnity of guiding dignified choices, 
in the absence of a path paved by systemic support.
 
Beyond the frontline of trauma care, a call echoes deeper, 
urging not just healing, but a bold reimagining, 
a reconstruction of not only shattered forms but the core of our caregiving ethos. 
In our pursuit to ease the sting of injury, 
we unearth our broader mission— 
not only as restorers of the broken but as architects of a new dawn 
where every action, every policy decision illuminates the value of life, 
resonating in the resolve of those committed to change.
 
Our journey takes us beyond the immediate, advocating for systemic transformations, 
like rethinking traffic systems to prevent the traumas we so often see, 
pushing for health policy reforms that prioritise prevention, care, and compassion. 
In this commitment, our deeds weave a narrative of hope, 
envisioning a path where healing is not just a personal journey but a societal stride, 
a collective movement towards a future where care is universal, 
and the roads we travel are safer for all.
***
Concluding our voyage — ""Beyond the Break"" is a plea for systemic transformation; a call to action that reverberates beyond the immediate confines of emergency care. This poem envisages a future where prevention, comprehensive care, and policy reform are seamlessly integrated into the healthcare fabric. 
There is hope.

5,Indian activist's hunger strike for Ladakh autonomy draws thousands of supporters,Protestors marched in 21-day hunger strike in the region's town of Kargil,"Famed Indian activist Sonam Wangchuk, on a hunger strike to bring autonomy to the Himalayan region of Ladakh, said on Saturday he was weak as his fast stretches into its 18th day but he would continue for three more days as planned despite pleas from supporters to stop.
Wangchuk's campaign seeks to highlight the damage to Ladakh's fragile ecology and glaciers by industrialisation as well as to protest what locals call encroachment by China.
He is determined to complete a 21-day hunger strike although supporters have urged him to end it early fearing further deterioration of his health, Wangchuk told Reuters by phone.
Even after it ends, local people and supporters will take it in turns to go on hunger strikes until he regains sufficient strength to fast again, he said.
Wangchuk added that some 2,000 people had come to his protest site in the city of Leh to show their support on Saturday. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm those numbers.
On Wednesday, thousands marched in the region's town of Kargil to demonstrate support.
After the Buddhist enclave was carved out of the Jammu and Kashmir region in 2019 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, it lost what regional autonomy it had.
Modi's party promised in the 2019 national elections that Ladakh would be added to the list of states recognised under the sixth schedule of the constitution, which would allow the creation of elected local bodies to protect tribal areas, but that has yet to happen.

""Ladakh has no democracy,"" Wangchuk, 57, said in an earlier interview with Reuters this week, adding that if the region had elected representatives, laws could be made to protect the land and forests from industrial and mining interests.
The federal interior ministry, Ladakh Lieutenant Governor's office and Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Talks on March 4 between the federal interior ministry and regional leaders about the local demands failed.
""They have been rude and gave cold-shoulder responses,"" said Asgar Ali Karbalai, the co-chairman of the Kargil Democratic Alliance.
The Indian Express reported this month that the government rejected demands for Ladakh autonomy, but offered to extend protections for local jobs and land and to address other concerns.
Wangchuk said the federal government had recently ""thrust"" a 13-gigawatt renewable energy project on nomadic pastures in Ladakh without local consultation.
""Ladakh is like a thermometer of the planet. So if it is destroyed ... it will be a global catastrophe,"" he said.
Scientists have warned that glaciers in the Hindu-Kush Himalaya could lose up to 75% of their volume by the end of the century due to global warming, causing dangerous flooding and water shortages for 240 million people.
Locals and nomadic tribes will march to the border with China on April 7 to highlight what they say has been the loss of land to Chinese encroachment and corporate interests, Wangchuk said. Local shepherds allege that China has taken over some of their grazing land and earlier this year some shepherds clashed with a Chinese Army patrolling unit.
In 2018, Wangchuk received the Ramon Magsaysay Award, known as Asia's Nobel Prize, for his innovative, community-driven reforms in education for Ladakh.

6,Bilawal felicitates Hindu community on Holi,PPP chairman says festival serves as reminder of shared humanity that transcends religious or cultural differences,"Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari wished on Sunday all those celebrating the festival of Holi.
In a statement, the former foreign minister highlighted the importance of fostering inclusivity and respect for diverse cultural traditions within the nation. He said, ""Holi serves as a reminder of the shared humanity that transcends religious or cultural differences.""
The former foreign minister stressed the imperative need for societal cohesion, advocating for mutual understanding and solidarity among Pakistan's diverse populace.
He highlighted the inherent values of tolerance and acceptance encapsulated by Holi, asserting that such celebrations foster inclusivity within the nation.
Echoing the sentiments of the nation's revered leaders, he stated, ""We seek guidance from the thoughts of Quaid-e-Azam, Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, and Shaheed Benazir Bhutto.""
""The unwavering commitment of our leaders to support the rights of every citizen without discrimination is a beacon for us,"" Bilawal added.
Holi, a vibrant Hindu festival of colors, is joyously celebrated by Hindu minority communities throughout Pakistan, symbolizing the arrival of spring and fostering a sense of unity and joy through spirited displays of colored powders and water.
On March 18, a prominent MNA and patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Hindu Council,  Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani requested PM Shehbaz and provincial chief ministers to timely announce advance salaries and public holidays for Hindu employees on the occasion of the Holi festival.

8,Seasons out of sync should worry you,Extreme changes in weather patterns can cause lower yield or crop failure sounding the alarm bell about food shortage,"Being a Karachiite, one can vouch for the impression that evenings in the city hit a different note with the sea breeze coming in; there is calmness in the air, and overall good weather conditions. No matter how hot the day gets, evenings are breezy. Being a millennial, I can remember wedding functions held in December were in cold weather but have you noticed lately that the onset of Karachi chilly weather is shifting to later months? Can you recall being a kid, when March or April was colder than it is now and November or December was not so cold? In the last three years, the seasonal shift has been evident not just in Karachi but across the country.
Pakistan is in the top 10 countries that are most affected by climate change according to Climate Index and the country is experiencing seasonal shifts or delayed seasons. For instance, winter would usually start in early November but now starts in late December and ends at the end of March. Eventually, the cycle will run its full course; if the season starts late, it will also end late. But it’s not just about completing the cycle of seasons. The delay in seasons is impacting the overall ecosystem. Let’s understand what season delays mean and what damage they can bring in the next few years.
“Season delays are simple to understand. Winters come late and fluctuate while going away as we have seen in the current scenario where, in February, one week it was summer but then the weather changed, it rained and again it was winter till the start of March,” told environmentalist Tofiq Pasha Mooraj, adding that this delayed spring and summer both. “When a season doesn’t start at its normal timing then it affects the crops and the country, which is highly dependent on agriculture, cannot afford that at all,” he explained.
Pakistan has been experiencing a wide range of climates, with scorching summers, chilly winters, and monsoon rains. These weather patterns can suddenly change or become extreme, which can stress crops and cause lower yields or crop failure. “Changing timelines of the seasons and climate change impacts are a pressing concern to be dealt with and have serious and complicated repercussions now: mainly food security,” Mooraj said. Certain seeds require certain temperatures to grow, sprout, and even for harvest but with fluctuating temperatures and changing timelines one cannot predict anything and we can face heavy loss of crops in the coming years.
For instance, Sindh and Punjab have a major mango crop every year which is also exported widely but mango seed sprouts in winter and is harvested in summer. However, given the current scenario of fluctuating temperatures, the sudden shift from winter to summer and then again back to winter during February and March, the seeds can be harmed. “The main problem here is the cycle is not repetitive,” said Mooraj, who grows mangoes on his farm.
“One year, it goes like this and the next year we get a normal cycle or say we don’t get spring at all. In such cases, one cannot predict at all when to plant the seed in what timeline.”
How can the transition of temperature affect crops?
According to Mooraj, in the second week of February this year, the temperature in Hyderabad was 22 degrees and within two days it went up to 36-39 degrees. Such transitions impact agriculture as sudden changes in temperature destroy the seed.
Crops can be harmed by extreme weather, such as heat waves or cold snaps. While cold snaps can result in frost damage and the death of vulnerable crops, heat waves can cause heat stress and dehydration in plants. “We can understand this with one of the largest crops that is wheat. It grows in winters and in summers it dehydrates and gets ready to harvest. But now when the summer comes late, it will not dehydrate on time and cannot be harvested. So how will the demand for wheat be met?” he questioned.
Variations in humidity and temperature can foster an environment that is conducive to the growth of illnesses and pests. Crops can be attacked by fungi, insects, and pathogens, which can result in serious damage if not properly controlled. “When the seasons mix up, we see pests and diseases develop. In summers, pests reproduce and when the crops are not ready to harvest, they will destroy the almost ready crop - which again is a big loss,” Mooraj said.
He stressed that in a country which is already going through inflation, we cannot afford food scarcity. “We have seen crops getting destroyed in the floods of 2022 when we had to import onions and tomatoes, which cost a lot to the country’s economic situation.”
Abnormal weather patterns such as longer summers or shorter winters are not just the two seasons that are impacting agriculture but untimely rains, changing rain patterns and the amount of rainfall also adds to the problem. Pakistan did not receive snow at the right time this year, the northern areas had snowfall quite late this year which will result in water scarcity. “We have no mechanism to store rainwater so we just rely on dams that fill from snow melting and eventually with less snow we have a big issue at hand,” the environmentalist lamented.
The term “climate change” is slightly new as until 20 years back the term in use was “global warming”. After a severe change in global climate, it was understood that global warming isn’t the only effect, the world is facing a whole change of climate. “Anything that will happen out of the fixed season will bring disturbance, be it rain, winter or summer, be it coming early or coming later, everything will impact on a larger scale,” said environmentalist Waqar Ahmed.
A slight change in any weather cycle has great impact. An easy way to understand this is that every crop has a season to grow just as animals have breeding seasons, and birds migrate too depending upon seasons. Changes in temperatures disrupt an ecosystem as a whole. “We have not seen heat and cold waves so often in our lives as we have been experiencing in recent years,” Ahmed said. “The overall condition of Sindh and Balochistan, if we see extreme weather conditions, is evident in recent times with storms and floods.”
Two major things can be done to make the situation better: first is mitigation and second is adaptation. “Mitigation is lessened carbon emission, planting more forests trying to bring alternate energies to help in preventing climate change. Adaptation means planting low water crops and increasing energy efficiency,” he suggested. Energy efficiency can be gained by making energy-efficient homes which can stay temperature-controlled and do not require air conditioners, concrete houses that are already constructed can use materials to cover terraces to prevent heat and also use light colours on walls to help to keep the interior cool. “To make new homes one can use fiber, wood, and other such materials that are used across the world but all these are long-term planning,” Ahmed shared.
Pakistan has a water shortage, particularly in the arid seasons. Drought stress brought on by insufficient irrigation water can hinder crop development and output. “Being an agriculturally dependent country, we need to focus on growing crops that do not require more water while the major crops we grow are mostly those found in tropical countries such as banana, rice, mango, sugarcane, and all other water-intensive crops,” he said. Thus the country is wasting its land as we have no water and such decisions are only causing harm to delta and marine life.
Pakistan lacks basic policies for crop growing. There is a ministry under the name of climate change that has been making some efforts but majority of the impacts are still untouched.
“We need to modify crop patterns and incorporate every industry, and the whole setup in the climate change issues because growing low water crops can save water and can help in storing more food,” he said, proposing that crops should include guar, soybean, mung bean, sorghum, maize, pearl millet, wheat, oat, chili, linseed, mustard, sesame, ber, sunflower, Gladiolus, and fodder crops.
According to Ahmed, some initiatives on the government level have helped such as the Billion Tree Tsunami project and the carbon credits that the Sindh Forest Department has been working on. However, to curb crop loss due to seasonal delays, the government has to come up with long-term solutions. “A lot of research and development is required to prepare for the time to come in terms of food security… cold storages and infrastructure can be few things to start with,” Mooraj suggested. He advised that more vegetables and grains should be produced to store for difficult times because seasons are something which can’t be controlled but on ground situation can be predicted.
In the 2022 floods, Pakistan faced severe crop loss and damage to agricultural land. Regrowing proper crops took a year due to stagnant water and the land became infertile. Countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan are the most affected by the climate crisis. “It is not like we are the only ones who are facing season changes. Many other countries are also facing the same but they have ample amounts of money to develop and prepare themselves, such as Holland has made dams to save money. On the other hand, we can’t even hold back our sea bed. Until a few years back, we were still using carts and cows to plow the land which was very similar to the design of carts used in Mohenjo-daro which existed 4,500 years ago,” Mooraj said, painting a gloomy situation for Pakistan. There will
come a time when Karachi and Maldives will no longer exist, he said.
