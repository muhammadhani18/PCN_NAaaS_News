1,Pro-Gaza protesters block bridge outside UK parliament,"Death toll from Israeli bombardment rises to 22,722; Hezbollah fires barrage of rockets","Pro-Palestinian protesters blocked roads outside the British parliament in London on Saturday, demanding an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and clashing with police who prevented them from marching across Westminster Bridge.
Videos posted on social media showed police blocking protesters’ access to the bridge and a Reuters reporter said there had been several small scuffles. Unable to fully access the bridge, where they had planned to unfurl banners, protesters instead occupied the surrounding roads.
The protest aimed to push politicians to adopt a harder stance towards Israel. So far, Britain has stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire, with foreign minister David Cameron arguing that any such agreement could be unsustainable and may worsen violence without a plan for longer term peace.
London, like other Western cities, has seen regular and sometimes large demonstrations calling for Israel to halt the bombardment of Gaza in which, according to Palestinian health officials, thousands of people, mostly women and children, have so far been killed.
Israel’s onslaught began after Hamas fighters from Gaza attacked Israel on October 7, with 1,200 people killed and 240 taken hostage. The Israeli offensive had killed 22,722 people by Saturday, according to Palestinian health officials, and devastated the tiny enclave of 2.3 million people.
Fighting raged on inside Gaza, especially in and near the southern city of Khan Younis, where the Israeli military said it had killed three members of the Hamas. In a late night Israeli air strike, Palestinian officials said, seven people were killed and dozens were wounded at a house of the Al-Nabris family.
At least 122 Palestinians were killed and 256 others injured in Gaza in the space of 24 hours, they added. according to the official Palestinian WAFA news agency, 18 Palestinians had been killed by an Israeli attack on a house east of Khan Younis.
The Palestinian Red Crescent reported heavy shelling inside Khan Younis near the Al-Amal Hospital. Shrapnel flew into the medical facility amid the sound of heavy gunfire from drones, it said in a post on social media platform X.
The Israeli military said its commandos had killed three fighters and found “many weapons, grenades, magazines and vests that were used by Hamas” in a civilian home. overall, Israel claimed that it had killed 8,000 Hamas fighters in northern Gaza but some still remain there.
The traumatised residents of Gaza, most of whom have been displaced at least once by the bombardment, are wrestling with acute shortages of food, medicine and fuel. Israel said that its operation to dismantling Hamas had been completed.
In further escalation in the war, Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said on Saturday it had fired rockets at Israel, and its arch-foe said it had struck a “cell” in retaliation, as top US and EU diplomats visited the region to seek ways to halt the spillover from the war.
Air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel early on Saturday when the military said it had identified some 40 “launches” from Lebanon toward the area of Meron. Hezbollah said it had hit a key Israeli observation post with 62 rockets as a “preliminary response” to the killing of Hamas’ deputy chief.
Saleh al-Arouri Arouri was killed by a drone in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Tuesday. Lebanese group Jama’a Islamiya said it had fired two volleys of rockets at Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel, the third operation it has claimed since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct 7.

2,Fazl off to Kabul for talks on TTP,"11-member delegation, headed by JUI-F chief will visit Kabul on invitation of Haibatullah Akhund","After a consultative meeting in Islamabad, the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief is all set to leave for Kabul today (Sunday) on the invitation of the interim Afghan government to discuss Islamabad’s approach on the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other issues.
Pakistan hopes that Maulana Fazlur Rehman's religious influences on the Afghan Taliban would bring peace and stability with Kabul bowing to Islamabad’s demands.
An 11-member delegation, headed by the JUI-F chief and including former South Waziristan MNA Maulana Jamaluddin Mehsud, Mufti Ibrar and members from the Haqqani religious seminary, will visit Kabul on the invitation of the Ameerul Momineen Mullah Haibatullah Akhund.
Some of the religious scholars already landed in Kabul on Saturday while the Maulana along with other members of the delegation will join them on Sunday.

Maulana Fazl would have a meeting with Haqqani Network chief Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul and Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob to discuss the Islamabad agenda with them, sources in Kabul revealed.
The two sides will discuss the TTP and other issues, including bring them to the negotiating table, ensuring the elections security in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and the merged districts, pushing them away from border areas, border management, trade relations and also the visa free movement at Chaman border points.
The two sides already made promises on security affairs when Mullah Shirin, the governor of Kandahar province, had landed last week in Islamabad while Maulana Fazl’s visit would give further push on all topics concerned, the source added.
Besides Maulana Fazl, Maulana Mehsud who has influence over the TTP groups in South Waziristan could also bring the TTP Mehsud and Wazir groups to the negotiating table for talks.

3,SC seeks guarantee against illegal arrests,Orders govt to submit written undertaking signed by senior-most officers of ministries concerned,"The Supreme Court has directed the federal government to submit an undertaking in writing that from now on no one shall be picked up “other than in accordance with the law”.
This undertaking will be signed by the senior-most officers of the ministries concerned.
According to the written order for the Jan 3 proceedings of the court on the petitions filed against enforced disappearances in the country, the apex court strongly objected to manhandling of the families of the missing persons from the Balochistan province in Islamabad.
“This court takes great exception to such high-handedness because the right to peaceful protest is among the guaranteed fundamental rights which must be honoured in letter and spirit,” the order that was released on Saturday said.
Last month, a group of protesters—mostly women and children—arrived in Islamabad from Turbat district of Balochistan to protest against enforced disappearances in the province.
The Islamabad police, however, launched a crackdown on the protesters and rounded up dozens of them, a move that was widely criticised by civil society as well as political leaders.
Later, the authorities announced the release of the protesters on the order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Referring to its earlier order, the SC noted: “Every citizen and political party has the right to assemble and protest provided such assembly and protest is peaceful and complies with the law imposing reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order.
“The right to assemble and protest is circumscribed only to the extent that it infringes on the fundamental rights of others, including their right to free movement and to hold and enjoy property.”
The written order also explained in detail as to what information the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances must provide to the apex court before the next hearing of the case.

“The commission is directed to collate and submit: names with parentage and addresses of those who went missing; name and relationship of the person who reported the missing person; date they went missing [and] those who were in government in the Federation and the concerned province at that time.
“[It should also inform] whether the missing person was recovered or not; if not recovered, the efforts, if any, taken to find out the whereabouts of the missing person. In addition, all those in respect of whom production orders were issued but were not produced, and what was the follow-up by the Commission when its production orders were not complied with.”
The order highlighted that the commission will provide this information electronically and through hard copy to the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP) within 10 days.
“Upon receipt thereof, [the AGP] will submit a response, including why production orders issued by the Commission were not complied with, within 20 days after the Commission supplies the said information. The learned AGP [will] submit a report [hard copy and electronically] to this court.”
The order also touched upon the strange incident of the disappearance of a piece of legislation about enforced disappearances from the Senate Secretariat during the PTI’s rule. The bill moved by former minister for human rights Shireen Mazari had already been passed by the National Assembly.
The court noted that the bill went missing from the Senate during the term of the incumbent Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani, “who was elected by those who were then in government [PTI]”.
“It is alleged that a federal minister’s [Mazari’s] efforts were thwarted by the Senate chairman, who was elected by the votes of the same party. This is a very serious allegation levelled against Mr Sadiq Sanjrani and which pertains to missing persons.
“However, we note that the Senate Chairman, Mr Sadiq Sanjrani, has not been arrayed as a party, therefore, unless the petitioner arrays him as a party it would not be appropriate to attend to allegations made against him,” the order said.

4,Counter-resolution for timely polls moved,Lawyer seeks contempt proceedings against senators who voted for delaying Feb 8 vote,"A counter resolution was submitted in the Senate Secretariat on Saturday, calling for holding the next general election on its scheduled date of Feb 8, a day after the upper house of parliament, through a resolution, sought postponement of the vote because of inclement weather and security concerns.
The resolution was submitted by Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Senator Mushtaq Ahmed as a lawyer moved the Supreme Court, seeking contempt of court proceedings against the senators who voted for the resolution during a thinly attended session on Friday.
With a little over a month to go for the general elections, the Senate twice passed a resolution the other day to postpone the Feb 8 vote because of a harsh winter weather in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Balochistan and the law and order situation in the two provinces.
The resolution, moved by Senator Dilawar Khan, received support from lawmakers belonging to various political parties, including the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-N), the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) and others.

The petition, seeking contempt of court proceedings against the Senate chairman and the members, was filed by a lawyer, Ishtiaq Ahmed, who contended that the resolution was against a Supreme Court decision, which had ordered the election to be held as per the Constitution.
In his courter-resolution, Senator Mushtaq said that the resolution passed by the Senate the other day was an attack on democracy and election, and it disrespected the house.
He added that the Friday’s resolution was unconstitutional and the house could not pass any unconstitutional resolution.
He termed the elections a constitutional requirement which was the responsibility of the caretaker government and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
He also pointed out the relevant decision of the Supreme Court in this regard.
He alleged that the caretaker government and undemocratic forces were running away from elections, adding that postponing the elections would have dangerous effects on the country’s politics, democracy, constitutionalism, unity and integrity.

5,Bilawal dismisses ‘polls delay’ notion,PPP chief visits NA-127 constituency; says Feb 8 date for elections is set in stone,"Dismissing Senate’s bid to delay polls, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Saturday declared that the Feb 8 vote was cast in iron, pledging that the his party would contest the upcoming elections to defeat the selection.
During his visit to different areas of NA-127, Lahore, from where he is contesting the elections, he stressed that the PPP represented every strata of the society and believed in inclusive politics.
He added that the PPP's 10-point agenda would redress the issues facing the masses.
Bilawal dismissed the Senate resolution, which was passed on Friday.
The resolution had demanded postponement of the elections because of inclement weather and a deteriorating law and order situation in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
“Doesn’t matter if the resolution is passed by the United Nations or the OIC (Orgnaization of Islamic Cooperation), the Election Commission (of Pakistan) and Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa have said that election will be held on February 8,” he said.
“We are with Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa. The elections are set in stone,” he continued. “Now that the elections have been announced, I don’t want to waste my time complaining about the level-playing field. My focus now is only on the elections,” he added.
Bilawal visited various churches in Bihar Colony and spoke to the media.
Those who accompanied the PPP chairman included Chaudhry Manzoor, Zulfiqar Badr, Qasim Gilani, Faisal Mir, Aslam Gill, Amjad Hussain, Imran Athwal, Naseem Sahutra, Edwin Sahutra, Pastor Williamson and others.
Bilawal said that the PPP was defamed under a conspiracy in the past and an impression was given “on the television that rivers of milk and honey flow in Lahore”, adding that he, however, witnessed that the city needed ample development work.
“People from every strata of the society live here but the government always represented the elite. Now, I have come back. Insha’Allah, I will contest the selection in this election and old politics and politicians will be replaced by new politics,” he said.

Criticising the rival parities, he emphasised that only the PPP believed in the politics of equality, adding that that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) was fighting to save Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) to save its founding chairman.
“Only the Peoples Party is fighting the elections for the people,” he said, adding that he chose Lahore for his election seat, “so that the Peoples Party can change the destiny of this city, province, and country as I am with you and will always be”.
“The PPP has always represented the downtrodden, which is why its leadership and workers have been targeted and martyred so that other parties can fill the vacuum created. The PPP governor sacrificed his life and my brother Shaheed Shahbaz Bhatti was martyred, he said.
Speaking on the occasion, Faisal Mir said that the party would defeat the Sharif family in the elections.
Bishop Naeem Parshad assured that they would make the PPP successful in every constituency.
On the occasion, Bilawal was presented a copy of the Bible and he cut a Christmas cake.
Bilawal took the tour of the constutency to meet his electorate. From Kot Lakhpat, he reached Grace Assemblies of Pakistan Church after passing through different streets of Bihar Colony.
The local residents greeted Bilawal by showering rose petals on him.
After meeting Bishop Naeem Parshad, Bilawal also visited the residence of Pastor Anwar Fazal of the Eternal Life Church at Modern Colony.
He assured Pastor Fazal of resolving the issues facing the Christian community.

6,Pakistan deploys warships in Arabian Sea,"Navy says actively monitoring maritime situation to safeguard national, international merchant ships","The Pakistan Navy has deployed its warships in the Arabian Sea “in the wake of the recent maritime security incidents”. The purpose of this deployment is to “protect Pakistan bound and international shipping traversing through our area”.
“The Pakistan Navy is ensuring a permanent presence in the Arabian Sea to keep our and international Sea Lines of Communications under intense surveillance,” said a brief statement issued by the navy’s spokesperson on Sunday.
Sea Lines of Communications refer to established maritime routes and pathways used for commercial shipping, naval operations, and other maritime activities between ports and through open waters. These routes are crucial for international trade, transportation of goods, and the movement of naval vessels.

According to the navy’s director general public relations, two to three warships maintain consistent patrols in the areas frequented by Pakistan-bound and international merchant vessels
“In addition [to this], extensive air surveillance is also being undertaken to ensure the safety of international Sea Lines of Communications passing through our maritime area,” it said.
In the last week of December, arch rival India also deployed three of its warships in the Arabian Sea.
The development took place after an India-bound ship, MV Chem Pluto, came under an alleged drone attack off the coast of Indian State of Gujarat in the Arabian Sea on December 23.
On January 5, the Indian Navy reportedly rescued the crew of a merchant vessel after its attempted hijack in the Arabian Sea.  An Indian Navy warship intercepted the Liberian-flagged MV Lila Norfolk bulk carrier less than a day after it received a report that the vessel had been hijacked about 460 nautical miles off Somalia.
About five to six armed people boarded the vessel on Thursday, according to a report received by the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency, which said the ship's crew had gathered in the ship's citadel. The Indian Navy said all 21 crew on board, including 15 Indians, had been evacuated.

7,Social media slowdown hampers PTI's virtual fundraiser,PTI alleges abrupt disruption in social media services shows 'petty aggression',"The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) virtual fundraiser on Sunday once again encountered challenges in the digital sphere due to a social media blackout that disrupted internet services and blocked access to major social platforms across the nation, leading to complications in the local banking system's efforts to collect donations for the party in Pakistan.
NetBlocks, a global internet monitor, corroborated the widespread disruption to social media platforms ahead of the PTI's virtual rally.
The internet tracking agency reported a widespread disruption in social media platforms across Pakistan, including X, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
It noted that the occurrence coincided with the launch of the election fundraising telethon by Imran Khan's party, PTI.
According to Alp Toker, Director of Netblocks, the disruptions were impacting network providers nationwide.
Toker stated, ""Targeting political activities on such a large scale through social media across the nation is highly uncommon. Venezuela is another country known to have employed similar tactics to restrict opposition speeches and rallies.""A comparable situation occurred just a month ago when internet disruptions were observed during a PTI virtual event.
Earlier in the day, PTI had declared its plan to conduct a virtual fundraising telethon and manifesto unveiling at 9 pm.
However, by around 6 pm, users from various regions of the country reported an inability to access social media platforms. Concurrently, complaints surfaced about sluggish internet services
Nonetheless, PTI’s virtual telethon collected donations of over $125,000 and Rs100 million were collected during over four hours of the broadcast by overseas and local PTI supporters besides pledges which may be realised in the coming days.
‘Petty acts of aggression’
Reacting to the abrupt disruptions in social media services, the PTI alleged that the occurrence was specifically meant to target PTI, saying that the move “just shows how petty acts of aggression by the illegitimate state, such as internet shutdown, can never stand in the face of the resolve of an enlightened, resilient nation”.
PTI, on its official X handle, termed the development shameful, demanding that the Caretaker IT Minister should resign.
Meanwhile, PTI leader Sayed Zulfi Bukhari said that the internet services were shut down to stop the party’s fundraiser.
This is not the first time that social media and internet services have been disrupted in the country. On December 17, a similar blockage was reported before a PTI virtual rally.The disruption of the internet and social media services incurred billions of rupees worth of losses to Pakistan’s telecom sector. The suspension affected e-commerce, online services, home delivery and ride-hailing apps to a great extent.

‘Imran punished for demanding nation’s freedom’
Meanwhile, during the party’s virtual fundraising telethon, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan reiterated the party’s allegations that Imran Khan, who is behind bars, was being punished for his commitment to real freedom in Pakistan.
“He finds himself incarcerated under dubious charges solely for the cause of his nation's freedom. Imprisoned with the sole purpose of safeguarding the liberty and right to express for every Pakistani citizen, he remains resolute in his pursuit of these ideals, he asserted.
Furthermore, he emphasised Imran’s commitment to the protection of the nation's rights and the strengthening of its institutions, particularly advocating for an independent judiciary and a robust justice system.
The PTI chief further asserted that the future trajectory of Pakistan lies in constitutional democracy, wherein power resides with the people and a meticulous system of checks and balances ensures accountability and justice.
Expressing optimism despite perceived injustices against his party, Barrister Gohar stressed the essential nature of elections as a constitutional means to hold the outgoing government accountable and reaffirmed the party's constitutional right to participate in this democratic exercise.Owing to jittery internet connectivity in the country, the PTI chairman could not complete his address and disconnected abruptly during his speech.
Addressing the telethon audience, PTI candidate and senior advocate Salman Akram Raja lamented the unprecedented circumstances facing the nation, characterising it as a systemic assault.
He described the helplessness of civil servants and the police in the face of powerful forces, urging the people of Pakistan to prevail in the ongoing war through their right to vote.
Former Special Assistant of the Prime Minister on Poverty Alleviation, Senator Dr Sania Nishtar, shared her experiences working under the leadership of former Prime Minister Imran Khan and highlighted the government's initiatives for social protection and poverty alleviation in the country.
She highlighted that modern technology and banking channels were used for the first time in Pakistan for disbursement payments in a transparent and respectable manner.
During the telethon, other party leaders and workers recounted their struggles post-May 9.
The party paid tribute to martyrs of the struggle for real independence in Pakistan through a slideshow, complemented by party anthems, songs, and short documentaries.
