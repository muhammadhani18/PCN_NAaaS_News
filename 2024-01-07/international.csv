1,New batch of buses under PBS arrives: Sharjeel,Says ‘Pink Bus’ and EV were unique projects which no govt had thought about,"Former Sindh minister for information, transport, and mass transit Sharjeel Inam Memon announced on Saturday that a new batch of buses for the People’s Bus Service (PBS) has arrived in Karachi for the second phase of the transport project.
Sharing the information on the social media platform ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), the PPP leader shared that “these buses were procured by PPP’s Sindh government”.
The intra-district People’s Bus Service project was launched in Karachi in June 2022 during the PPP’s tenure. The air-conditioned buses were imported from China.
Sharjeel further said that the people of Karachi now avail this ‘amazing service' at the best economical fare.
Sharjeel added that the recently arrived buses would be operational on their designated routes in a few days.
For the Peoples Intra District Bus Service project’s first phase, around 240 air-conditioned buses were imported from China. In the first phase, seven routes had been finalised initially on which all 240 buses operate.

Later, after an increase in demand, the transport minister under PPP-led Sindh government added more routes by including Clifton, Defence and Gulshan-e-Hadeed in July 2022.
The PPP-led Sindh government also launched the first route of the electric bus service under its Peoples Bus Service programme. The electric buses are environmentally friendly and offer a budget-friendly alternative to commuters. 
The former minister for transport also launched ‘Pink Bus’, a women-only bus service in Karachi, to address the commuting problems of working women. For this service the Sindh government had planned to recruit female bus drivers to ensure complete sense of protection to female passengers.  
Sharjeel said, ‘Pink Bus’ and Electrical Vehicles were the unique projects which no government had thought about.
Sharjeel also launched the much-delayed Green Line bus project under PBS programme and carried forward and completed the Orange Line BRT project and successfully launched buses on various city routes.

7,Gas shortage puts extra financial burden on consumers,"Even before onset of intense cold, complaints about gas supply have been widespread","Gas shortages intensify financial strain on citizens, particularly during severe cold spells.
The cold weather in Hyderabad has exacerbated existing challenges, including electric load-shedding and rising electricity prices. 
The scarcity of gas during this period, aggravated by the suspension of supply from the Sui Southern Gas Company, has deepened the woes of residents. 
Even before the onset of the intense cold, complaints about gas supply were widespread in densely populated areas across the city. 
However, the ongoing severe cold wave has heightened the scarcity of gas.
Hyderabad faces severe gas shortages in densely populated areas. 
Read Gas woes paralyse industries
In various units of Latifabad, gas is supplied for only nine hours, limited to morning, afternoon, and evening. 
The gas pressure has noticeably decreased, sometimes reaching extreme lows. In areas like Latifabad Unit No. 11 & 12, residents experience minimal gas supply, lasting only a few minutes a day, prompting them to rely on LPG cylinders for daily cooking needs. 
Similar gas scarcity affects heavily populated areas such as Liaquat Colony, Quaidabad, Firdous Colony, Kali Mori Road, Teen Number Talab, and Yasrab Colony. Many residents resort to buying food from eateries.
Complaints of gas unavailability also arise in parts of SITE. Labour Colony in SITE reports no gas supply from morning to evening but availability from 10pm to 7am. 
Similar issues are reported in various areas of Qasimabad, ranging from complete gas scarcity to three-hour supply periods in the morning, afternoon, and night.

8,Senate resolution for poll delay denounced,"Decision has no weight as it was supported by a few senators, says former CM","The former Sindh chief minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Saturday said that the resolution of the senate seeking deferment of the February 8 general election holds no weight because it was passed by just over a dozen of senators in a house also deficient of quorum. 
Talking to the media in Aarazi and Bubak areas of Jamshoro district on Saturday Shah maintained that the senate session is never held after the Friday prayer.
However, not only the session was convened the other day but also a minority of senators backed the resolution in what arguably was an unlawful practice. ""That meeting is shorn of legality,"" he emphasised.
The former chief minister contended that the world wanted to see a democratic Pakistan where an elected government fostered relations with the global community. 
Shah recalled that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and President Dr Arif Alvi decided the election date after consultation. Subsequently, the Supreme Court also ordered that the elections should be held on February 8, he added.
He expressed his hopes that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) will sweep polls across the country and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari will be elected as the country's prime minister. 
Read SC moved against Senate's election postponement resolution
Earlier on Friday, PPP Sindh president, Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, said that the Senate Chairman, Sadiq Sanjrani, should be ashamed of holding a session which lacked quorum and for letting a resolution which desired postponement of the elections be passed from the upper house.
""Although, there is no significance of this resolution yet we condemn it."" He said at least 25 members were supposed to be present in the house to fulfill the minimum requirement of the quorum. He questioned how the senate's chairman did not notice the insufficient number of the members.
Khuhro said Sanjrani himself will be gone from the senate after a month when his term expires. 
""Around 250 to 260 million people living in Pakistan yearn for their right to vote,"" he asserted. Nisar said the country has been through the worst times when the menace of terrorism was far more threatening. He recalled that the elections took place even when the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto was martyred on December 27, 2007.
Separately, Milli Yakjahti Council (MYC) President and Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Pakistan (JUP) Sahibzada Abul Khair Muhammad Zubair has condemned the killing of Sunni Ulema Council leader Molana Masood-ur-Rehman Usmani in Islamabad. 
He said the assassination seemed to be a part of the conspiracy aimed at postponement of the general elections. He also expressed his disapproval of the senate's resolution in this regard, reiterating that the quorum was incomplete.
