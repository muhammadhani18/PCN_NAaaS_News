0,RIUT grapples with HVAC issue,Unexpected development exacerbates problems of patients in chilly weather,"As the country is hit by a cold wave, the Rawalpindi Institute of Urology and Transplantation (RIUT) faces a critical challenge of the malfunctioning of its crucial heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system.
The unexpected development has exacerbated the problems of the patients, their attendants and the hospital staff during the harsh winter conditions.
Upon discovering the breakdown of the hospital’s HVAC system during his visit, the Rawalpindi commissioner swiftly issued orders for its immediate repairs. The targeted completion time for the fix was set for Saturday night.
Expressing concern for the patients, the commissioner emphasised the urgency of changing HVAC sensors promptly, ensuring full functionality by the evening. During his visit, he inspected crucial departments, including emergency, operation theatre, radiology, dialysis centre, and the Outpatient Department (OPD).

“The patients can't bear this cold; the HVAC sensors should be changed immediately and should be made fully functional by this evening,” the commissioner told the relevant officials.
Subsequently, the commissioner received a comprehensive briefing from the Director of Medical Services (DMS) regarding the hospital’s facilities and ongoing renovation work conducted by the building department. The hospital, equipped with 250 beds, accommodates over 100 emergency patients daily, underscoring its commitment to providing state-of-the-art healthcare services.
The RIUT’s OPD handles about 250 to 300 patients each day while offering services such as surgery, dialysis, pathology, radiology, and nephrology. Anticipating further enhancement, the kidney transplant unit is slated for completion by March.
Furthermore, 13 departments of Holy Family Hospital (HFH) are temporarily extending services at RIUT, which is currently experiencing increased patient volume due to ongoing renovations at HFH. Notably, all encroachments on the service road near RIUT have been cleared, facilitating convenient patient access to the hospital.

During his visit, the commissioner acknowledged RIUT’s dedication to providing cutting-edge medical facilities to the people of Rawalpindi. 
He seized the opportunity to engage with patients and their families, demonstrating a commitment to understanding their concerns first-hand.
Authorities remain resolute in their mission to swiftly restore the HVAC system, alleviating the discomfort faced by patients during the winter season.
The RIUT, a mega health project which was initiated in 2012, remains incomplete despite its construction conclusion in 2005. Operating without kidney transplant services, the hospital’s limited offerings include outpatient, emergency, and dialysis units.
Shehbaz Sharif laid the foundation of the project as the chief minister of Punjab in 2012. 
However, the project was hit by many snags in the preceding years for one reason or the other with the change of hands at the provincial level.

2,Capital traders decry unlawful constructions,Say completion certificates being issued to buildings which have been declared illegal,"The recent cropping up of shopping plazas and other infrastructure in various sectors of the federal capital comes at the expense of marring the planned city’s well-thought-out layout.
All Pakistan Association of Traders and Traders Action Committee’s Islamabad President Ajmal Baloch and Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) Traders Committee’s Secretary and Convener, Khalid Chaudhry, exclaimed on Saturday that the master plan of Islamabad was “ruined”.
Echoing their concerns, they said: “Plazas being constructed in street markets and sub-sectors in place of smaller stores which sell items of daily use are a cause of concern. The small markets have existed as part of the master plan since its inception, and it is now being neglected as these vital stores are being demolished.”

Shops and markets were thoughtfully incorporated into the city planning to meet the needs of the local population. It included various services, such as barbers, cobblers, greengrocers, general stores, milk, yoghurt, hardware and other small sellers. Several shops that were previously situated in the markets of the federal capital have been closed down.
The trader’s association believes this to be an illegal act. “The question is, where these small shops and businesses would go,” they questioned, lamenting that the Capital Development Authority (CDA) Building Control Department formally approved alteration to the planned maps, which was illegal.
It was further pointed out that illegal constructions were underway in several sub-sector markets including Farooqia Market in F-6/1. “Despite the submission of many complaints, construction work in Farooqia market has not stopped,” they claimed, adding that the street where the work was taking place had been closed and a transformer was installed. The public road in the area was bored and blocked, which obstructed the citizens’ daily routine.
