0,JUI-F announces candidates in Punjab,Fields candidates in constituency from where PML-N Quaid may contest elections,"The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl, an ally of the PML-N, has announced its candidates for 53 national and 138 provincial constituencies of Punjab, including three National Assembly seats of Lahore, suggesting that the plan of an alliance with their former partners is yet to materialise.
According to a statement issued by the JUI-F Punjab chapter, the party has fielded candidates on around one-third NA seats and more than 40 per cent of provincial assembly seats, which includes six women candidates.
The JUI-F, a PML-N ally, is likely to enter into an election alliance in Sindh, an idea being pursued by the latter. Both parties have already entered into alliance in Shangla, K-P.
Read  Political analysts say PML-N, JUI-F having ‘rude awakening’
A source indicated that prior to entering into an alliance, which meant extending its support for the PML-N in Sindh and K-P, the JUI-F wanted some space in Punjab as a quid pro quo.
The PML-N, which already has work cut for self-accommodating former PTI defectors who helped bring down the Imran government, according to the source, does not feel it has the capacity to accommodate even the aforementioned that they have been asked to assist, let alone accept new requests.
Read  JUI-F warns against its ouster from parliament
Further, the JUI-F announced fielding candidates from Lahore, especially from the seat where PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif is expected to contest the election, NA-130, though nothing has been made public by the PML-N in this regard. The JUI-F has fielded Saleemullah Qadri from NA-130, NA-118 and PP-175 and Hafiz Ghazanfar Aziz from NA-128 for the upcoming elections.
Interestingly, Hamza Shehbaz is expected to contest from NA-118. Further, the party has fielded Maulana Safiullah from NA-92, Ziaur Rehman NA-56/PP16, Sajjad Wains NA-148, Muhammad Safdar Shehbaz NA-165/167/168/PP-254, and Maulana Yahya Abbassi NA-176/PP-273.

1,A wordsmith’s resilience,Shamim Akhter's curiosity for books transcended linguistic borders and evolved into a prolific career,"Living in a huge residence in Mohalla Baqar Shah, Koocha Dilawar Khan, an old area of Peshawar, veteran journalist Shamim Akhter never really thought she would become one. She didn’t even know that she would become an avid reader which would manifest as a writer and then a journalist within her.
It all began one day when she randomly picked up the first book from the huge library in her house —a library that comprised of books from all languages and genres, from all parts of the world. Inspired by her elder brother, her love for reading developed under his shadow.
Among the four siblings, she was the only one who had the curiosity to read every book in that library. The walls of the large room were lined with shelves filled with books organisedin different sections right up to the ceiling. She read many books from there and felt they were not enough to quench her thirst for reading.
Ofcourse, her passion for reading, gave Akhtar a vocabulary and knowledge unmatched with that of most people of the time. Belonging to a progressive family where her brother servedin the Navy, she was encouraged to study and learn whatever she wanted to.
“Soon after completing my matriculation, I came to Karachi as I always admired this city and wanted to live here,” shares Akhtar. “Back in the 60s it was a beautiful city with open spaces, fresh air, a great fashion scene, and independent culture which was quite the opposite of what we had in Peshawar where other than a few families, educating girls was not very common.”
Akhtar came to Karachi when her elder sister completed her intermediate and got admission into Dow Medical College. “I landed in St-Joseph college for my intermediate,” she narrated reminiscing the day when she arrived in Karachi as a young girl.
She shared how she has seen the beautiful and peaceful city falling into shambles before her eyes from being one that was so full of life, with a verve of life, the spirit to grow and the innate capacity to provide. “Karachi has been brutally politicised and now it is not what it used to be,” she says.
She recounted that it wasn’t easy for her to get into college in Karachi. “My admission in the college was difficult as all the admissions were closed and no one was allowed despite securing a good percentage in matric,” she shares, her characteristic wide smile lighting up her face. “But one day when we went to St. Joseph’s College, my brother was wearing his navy uniform and maybe that intimidated the principal. I must say that I landed into good hands and since then I never looked back.”
Short, silvery hair, wrinkled hands, and a soft voice add to her warm personality, and while age has graced her personality, her professional experience makes her an institution in herself. Her intensive reading created a sensitive writer in Akhter, who wrote stories narrating her experiences. Her love for reading was not in any specific language but Urdu, English, and just about any book she got her hands on.
“Most of the time my elder brother would scold me for reading books that were not age-appropriate for me, but I didn’t care what I was reading because I never hesitated to learn,” she says, a glint in her eye. “Most of the time I read these books when he was not around and snuggled in a quilt, I used to hide myself and my books away from him. But I never gave up. reading what I wanted to read.”
Akhtar recalled an incident when once she got caught by her brother, and was scolded too.“My heart was pounding with fear and anxiety, but right after being reprimanded I went back to the book!” she recalls. “My passion for reading came from anything that had words in it that I could learn from or gave me knowledge. I had this curiosity to read everything, from magazines to newspapers, every book from Geeta to Bible and from medical books to philosophical works.
She completed her Masters in philosophy from the University of Karachi and had no plan to work or do anything in particular, but she used to write stories in her whenever she had the time. One day her brother-in-law suggested that she visit the office of Akhbar-e-Khwateen, [a women’s magazine in Urdu] which was near their residence on Sharae Faisal.
“He said you are such a talented girl and write so well, why don’t you go to the newspaper office and see if you can write anything for them,” she recounted how she fell into journalism by chance.
One day, she went. “But before going I thought that I should write a story and take it along with me to prove how well I could write as it would save me another trip to the office if they asked to write anything,” says Akhtar. “They liked the story and printed it and then printed a few more that I wrote. They kept printing my stories and sometimes they would they also ask me to write stories for Eid and other special occasions.”
Seventy-eight-year-old, Akhter started her career with Akhbar-e-Khwateen on April 1, 1967, as a feature writer when one day the editor of that time Musarrat Jabeen offered her a job if she wanted to work in the newspaper because she already wrote for it regularly.
Once she joined the newspaper, there was no turning back for her. With time she made her place in the journalist fraternity, and within the next eight years, she became the editor of Akhbar-e-Khwateen.
Since Akhter was brilliant at writing in both English and Urdu, many a time she was questioned if she took help from her husband who was a well-read man and well-reputed in the literary circle.
“When in 1996 Akhbar-e-Khwateen was closed down I was left with nothing and I started writing freelance for English dailies,” she recounts. “Many a time people used to question my write-ups but they never knew that I am a well-read person who has been taught by some of the best teachers,” she said remembering her English teacher from Peshawar who ignited the love of English and grammar in her when she was young.
Akhter has a PhD in social justice because she wanted to find the meaning of philosophy of life and what the ultimate good is.
Akhtar has written three books, each of a different genre, which reflects her versatility in her craft. While Tay Se Titli (2009), Tuway Se Tanveer is a children’s book in Urdu, Dil Mein Chubhe Kantay (2016) is for mature minds. The third one is titled Pakistani Children’s Art (2007).
The seasoned journalist with over 50 years of experience wrote for many international publications and preferred writing in English after her newspaper was shut down because the readership and exposure are better in the language and at the end of the day everyone has to put food on the table.
“While Urdu writing was paid Rs150-250 per article, English write-ups were paid Rs3000, and we had to put food on the table as well,” she explained adding that after Akhbar-e-Khwateen, she learned to use to computer in 1997 to keep up with the world so that shewould stay relevant in the new tools of journalism. However, with time she realised that her strong side is writing and that is what makes her stand out among her counterparts.
“I never knew I could write books and that too for children, but once I started working with the idea of writing for children, I loved it,” she said.
Akhter’s husband died 13 years ago and since then she has lived alone and found solace in her writing, “I do not ask people to read specific writers or read the specific type of books, I tell them to read anything and everything because the most important thing is to read,” she says. “My favourite writer from whom I learned a lot is Munshi Prem Chand, but no one believes that I equally love reading Reader’s Digest too, because I just loved reading no matter what it is.”

2,Even maestros miss sometimes,"Watching Dunki, feels that director Rajkumar Hirani has, at last, encountered a stumble in his illustrious career","It is difficult to live up to the expectations of your audience and fans after impressing them with epic work. The responsibility is burdensome, but perhaps that’s why people create a fan base for creative maestros such as Rajkumar Hirani who has created a strong fan club across the globe. His style of storytelling, subjects that he selects for his films, how he makes actors dance to his tunes so that he pushes their boundaries as performers and his knack for bringing in eternally beautiful and unforgettable music.
Hirani’s films such as Munna Bhai MBBS, 3 Idiots, PK and Sanju have not only marked his mastery as a craftsman but have also made the characters of main leads of these movies memorable. Ditto for Shahrukh Khan; the year 2023 started with a bang, with films such asJawan and Pathan, King Khan proved that he is still the ‘box office’ king. With Dunki, the expectations of the audience and fans were huge. Let’s see what the movie had to offer to its auiences.
In the small village of Lalto, where dreams are scarce, the movie tells a story of hope, sacrifice, romance and friendship. Manu (Taapsee Pannu), Balli (Anil Grover), and Buggu(Vikram Kochhar) work hard at small jobs, dreaming of living a better life in England.
Hardy (Shah Rukh Khan) enters the scene, bringing inspiration to their dreams. Together, they join an English class with Geetu Gulati (Boman Irani), hoping to pass the IELTS exam for a chance to migrate to England.
Things get even more interesting when Sukhi (Vicky Kaushal) joins the group. His struggle to save someone he cares about becomes a powerful part of the story, but there's a catch – he can't speak English well enough to get a visa. The film highlights the ups and downs of pursuing dreams.
Performance wise, the movie has little to boast about. Most of the actors seem to be repeating their performances that they have previously showcased in their career, as though they have reached a saturation point for these roles and have nothing new to add to the characters they played.
Taapsee Pannu performs well but at places appeared to go overboard and was a tad predictable. Those who have watched Taapsee in intense characters and have followed her body of work can easily tell that she brings nothing new to the film. After Jawan and Pathan, Shahrukh Khan, is back with his usual charming persona. His diehard fans will love him repeating something that they have seen previously in this type of character. Also, the Punjabi diction is poor. The mannerism is not very much like a soldier (fauji). Right from his entry till the last scene, Shahrukh Khan looked like walking out of any of his Yash Raj sets and straight into the sets of Rajkumar Hirani – and this is where the mismatch happens.
Vicky Kaushal’s character is half-cooked but the actor impresses in his short-lived role. His performance is amongst the finest and most impressive one. The scene where he is shown as a drunkard reflects his immense talented as an actor. At places Kaushal is raw and that’s the beauty of his performance. If you watch him closely in the scene where he reminisces about his love interest in a state where he is completely drunk, it will remind you of the same Vicky Kaushal from ‘Masaan’ saying “Yeh dukh kaahay khatam nahin hota”. But for some reason, his character was abruptly wrapped up with a scene that is hard to digest. Sukhi’s (Vicky Kaushal) character is a trademark character from Rajkumar Hirani’s universe, it is same as of Zaheer (Jimmy Shergill)), Joy Lobo (Ali Fazal) and Bhairao Singh (Sanjay Dutt) from Munna Bhai MBBS, 3 Idiots and PK respectively. But the character has not been treated as well as any of the above-mentioned ones.
Vikram Kochhar is a brilliant actor and those who have seen him in multiple webseries likeChoona, Rakhtanchal, Inside Edge, and Aashram know how talented he is, but in Dunki he is wasted. Ditto for Boman Irani, he has no scope in his character which is insipid. The rest of the actors also fail to make any impact.
The premise of Dunki is shaky. The logic on which the movie is based is frail and does not justify the acts of the characters by any means. For instance, Shahrukh Khan plays a soldier who comes to Laltu to return a tape recorder and meet the guy who saved his life. After finding out the truth, he stays in Laltu to help his saviours’ younger sister to migrate to London. For a moment, all the logic takes a backseat as the soldier, finds it more important to help her migrate by hook or crook to London rather than returning to his base to serve his country. And what is more ridiculous is that the law-abiding soldier helps them in opting to migrate illegally — again this cannot be justified by any means.
There are scenes which are forced and preachy. The scene where Shahrukh Khan raises questions regarding British-men entering India without any visa or other documentations might sound emotional, but it cannot connect with the laws and regulations laid after that time. It felt like such an unnecessarily and irrelevant rant. Such justifications are baseless. Oris the filmmaker implying that moving abroad illegally is something that should be made acceptable?
In another scene, Shahrukh Khan acts as a complete hooligan in the Church where TaapseePannu is shown getting married to a resident, so she could legally settle in London. For a grown-up man it looked very awkward and disrespectful to create such a scene in the Holy place for Christians. King Khan is shown petrifying the monk to a level that he locks himself in the confession box — if that’s the kind of ‘funny’ scenes you enjoy, you will probably love the movie.
The court drama is again very boring and predictable. The unneeded essence of patriotism is showered where it was not required. The makeup and the VFX in the film are super off. Shahrukh Khan’s younger and older self both are hard to believe when it comes to looks. His body posture is almost the same. Same for Taapsee Pannu.
The music and background score of Dunki is good. Two songs Lut Put and Nikle The Kabhieare very well composed, written and sung. It won’t be wrong to say that the entire soul of the movie lies in Nikle The Kabhie sung by Sonu Nigam, the song is soulfully sung by him and offers some great lyrics.
The movie leaves its audience with so many questions, a few are mentioned here. Why Vicky Kaushal’s character required an IELTS when he could have just gone on a visit visa, he was supposed to bring back his love. Why Hardy didn’t return to base after getting deported to India and served army? Why did he stay in Laltu for he wasn’t doing any welfare work for the residents of Laltu by any chance. Why was Boman Irani’s character so shallow? There are many other questions that come across at the climax but answers are nowhere to be found.
On the whole, this venture is a lost opportunity to create a foundation of a strong relationship between Rajkumar Hirani and Shahrukh Khan – the film is easily amongst the weakest of Hirani works on all fronts. It misses the peculiarity or Hirani’s universe. After watching this film, it feels like a relief that Shahrukh Khan couldn’t continue with Munnabhai MBBS and the titular lead was given to Sanjay Dutt, else the film wouldn’t have created such an impact and become a cult-classic. Watch it only if you are a Shahrukh Khan fan, if you are a Hirani fan, you will be royally disappointed with Dunki.
Based on weak script, below average performances and hard to digest justifications – the movie gets 2 out of 5 stars.

3,Carbon credits and green growth: Is Pakistan ready?,Economy and climate change can bring a transformative shift by integrating sustainability into its economic landscape,"As one of the top ten countries most severely impacted by climate change, Pakistan has experienced devastating floods and heatwaves in recent years. A prolonged decline in annual rainfall characterised the early 20th century, but since 1960, a slight increasing trend has prevailed.
This overall trend hides considerable sub-national variation. Mean rainfall in the arid plains of Pakistan and the coastal belt has decreased by 10 to 15 per cent since 1960, contributing to the ongoing degradation of the country’s wetlands and mangrove ecosystems. Most other regions have experienced a slight increase in both monsoon and dry seasons.
Heavy rainfall events have increased since 1960, and the nine heaviest rains recorded in 24 hours were recorded in 2010. Recent evidence suggests the glaciers in the headwaters of the Indus Basin may be expanding due to increased winter precipitation over the Himalayan region in the last 40 years.

Since the early 2000s, the World Bank Group, USAID, and the United Nations have been working with various stakeholders in Pakistan to reduce vulnerability, improve readiness, and achieve low-carbon green growth and resilient development. This would involve (1) supporting preparedness towards disasters and climate-related emergencies, (2) modernising irrigation networks and installing high-efficiency irrigation systems, and (3) efforts for low-carbon development, particularly in energy (renewables) and industries.
Signs of progress

Thirteen years after the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) initial recognition of the potential of carbon trading within the country, the Ministry of Climate Change is poised to introduce the inaugural policy draft.
In the current fiscal year alone, the federal government has granted Sindh the opportunity to accrue $200-220 million from carbon credits over the ensuing two decades. Remarkably, within less than a month, Singapore-based carbon exchange Climate Impact X disclosed that the demand for carbon-removal credits emanating from a mangrove restoration project in Pakistan surpassed the available supply by more than 50per cent.
Against a funding downturn in Pakistan, a proposition emerged suggesting that AgriTech entities should incentivise farming practices conducive to carbon capture. The measurement of such capture could be facilitated through collaborations with companies like TPL Maps, subsequently allowing for the sale of carbon credits, thereby creating new revenue streams for both parties involved.
This innovative approach became feasible following the issuance of the Green Banking Guidelines by the SBP in 2017 and the subsequent release of the Environmental & Social Risk Management Manual in 2022.
By providing these regulatory frameworks before the monetisation of carbon credits in Pakistan, the central bank actively engaged with the international discourse on climate change, advocating for sustainable economic development.
This strategic intervention also acknowledged the pressing issue of frequent and devastating natural disasters within the region, leading to human tragedies and substantial monetary losses. In doing so, the SBP underscored the imperative of aligning financial practices with environmental and climate considerations to address global challenges and foster resilient economic growth.
“These guidelines have elevated environmental protection on the global agenda,” said Moin Iqbal, head of business origination at InfraZamin Pakistan, which derives its approach from thePrivate Infrastructure Development Group, a pioneer in commercially viable sustainable financing. “These guidelines acknowledge the financial sector's responsibility to support policy initiatives that transition a country's economy toward a low-carbon and climate-resilient model.”
Iqbal added that the SBP guidelines have instilled environmental consciousness within the organisational culture and realigned banking products, services, and operations to minimise the ecological impact of banks and the economy.

“The central bank’s objective is to reduce banks' vulnerability to environmental risks, fulfill their ecological protection responsibilities, and provide financial support for transforming the economy into a resource-efficient and climate-resilient one,” said Iqbal.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has instituted a Renewable Energy Scheme to promote green banking practices. This initiative encourages businesses to leverage discounted financing to install energy-efficient equipment and implement renewable energy projects, with the overarching goal of diminishing carbon emissions.
Through this scheme, the SBP seeks to foster an environmentally conscious banking sector by incentivising and supporting enterprises in adopting sustainable measures. The discounted financing options provided by the SBP aim to facilitate the integration of eco-friendly technologies, making strides towards a more sustainable and low-carbon business landscape.
 
“While renewable energy remains foundational, the fusion of energy efficiency, equipment modernisation, power loss reduction strategies, and a dedicated focus on green housing within financing mechanisms positions Pakistan as a trailblazer in comprehensive climate mitigation,” wrote Abdul Waheed Bhutto, Pro Vice-Chancellor at Dawood University of Engineering and Technology.
Before implementing these guidelines, financial institutions lacked substantive sustainable financing policies. Introducing these policies has facilitated cohesive discussions with co-financiers, aligning shared objectives without substantially disrupting operational processes and decision-making frameworks.
“The shift towards environmental considerations in decision-making for all financiers has led to increased environmentally sustainable projects being proposed to banks for IZP's guarantee,” said Iqbal. “This has resulted in a robust pipeline of projects currently undergoing evaluation and has facilitated more straightforward conversations with customers as the environmental sustainability agenda gains momentum.”
Establishing sustainable financing guidelines has markedly enhanced the investment climate for various projects. Presently, institutions prioritise impact investing, preferring projects with substantial developmental impact. This shift in focus has resulted in a noticeable upswing in initiatives related to recycling, energy efficiency, and climate change mitigation, among other sustainability objectives.
 
Local examples

A noteworthy illustration of this paradigm shift is evident in the collaborative efforts of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and corporate entities like TPL Group, which aim to restore Karachi's coastal ecosystem. Adopting a hands-on approach to shoreline cleanliness, this collaboration involves the removal of debris and plastic waste.

Furthermore, on the technological front, a venture accelerator is actively contributing to emissions reduction by addressing the environmental impact of servers and infrastructure supporting AI products. This multifaceted approach exemplifies the transformative influence of sustainable financing guidelines in steering investments toward projects with a positive environmental and developmental footprint.
Fariha Rizwan, the former chief information officer of Z2C Limited, emphasised that reducing the number of computational tasks directly correlates with a decrease in overall power consumption and the associated emissions.
This perspective underscores the significance of optimising computational processes to mitigate environmental impact and promote sustainability in the context of information technology and venture acceleration.

“By removing layers of hierarchy and revising how tasks are designed and delivered, we were able to decrease the operational time of tasks by one-tenth in the aggregate, from nearly 20 minutes per task, for example, to less than two minutes,” she said.
Under Fariha Rizwan's leadership, an initiative was implemented to curtail the usage of traditional printers and paper, offering card scan alternatives instead. These tools leverage optical character recognition technology to scan, automatically save, and provide access to documents without printing.
In a separate endeavor, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), in collaboration with Green Earth Recycling and PepsiCo Pakistan, is actively engaged in a large-scale initiative to collect and recycle nearly five thousand tons of plastic waste. This initiative addresses a significant challenge, considering Pakistan's need for formal waste collection and recycling infrastructure.
Money talks

In early 2021, the United States government officially partnered with the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) to launch the Pakistan Private Sector Energy Project (PPSE). Supported by USAID, the PPSE is focused on expanding the portfolio of commercially viable clean energy projects in Pakistan and providing support to enable them to access financing and reach financial close.

The effort is the next stage in USAID’s efforts to reduce costs for energy distribution companies. Since 2010, the agency has partnered with the Government of Pakistan to add more than 3,900 MW to the national grid, benefitting more than 47 million Pakistanis, reducing costs by $429 million, and leveraging more than $2.8 billion in private investment.
Furthermore, USAID has supported the construction of new transmission lines and substations to evacuate power from wind power projects to the national grid and rehabilitated thermal and hydroelectric power plants.
In late 2021, Habib Bank Limited made agritech solutions much more affordable for farmers by partnering with BaKhabar Kissan, which is building farmers' capacity. It does this through agro-met and livestock advisory, weather forecasts, disaster alerts, crop health monitoring through satellite imagery, and an automatic weather station. The bank, however, benefits by using the technology provided to ensure agronomic advisory to the participating farmers.

Similarly, female-led EcoEnergy provides monthly installments for solar-powered electricity to off-grid rural areas across Pakistan. The pay-as-you-go nature of the revenue plan addresses the growing energy deficit by delivering affordable solar technology to all.

Besides providing solar power for homes and businesses across Pakistan, EcoEnergy has been electrifying schools, health clinics, and non-profit institutes that support women and the disabled by providing training for income generation and financial independence.

“Installing solar allows for more reliable power and generates countless savings every month, so more money can be put towards valuable training programmemes,” said Shazia Khan, CEO of EcoEnergy, which was part of PPSE’s first accelerator cohort. “Both of these projects have been supported by Power One For One Solar Foundation and Janine Voigt. We are proud to work with partners like these who are creating a positive social impact in these communities.”

Other notable examples include:

1. Farmdar - which uses satellite technology to collect farmland data and uses AI to analyze the collected information and deliver actionable insights. Farmers can keep track of plant count and yield, harvest monitoring, crop classification, nitrogen report, and plant health report.

2. Tazah - which is transforming the agriculture and food value chains to create a world with lasting dividends for farmers and retailers.

3. Khalis Fertilizers - which reduces land pollution by turning rotten fruits, vegetables, and crop residue into organic fertiliser.

4. Farmestor - which connects farmers to potential retail investors.

5. Humming Hyve - which is used by beekeepers to monitor the condition of a hive and ensure the quality of honey produced.
It is essential to underscore the urgency of such initiatives, given Pakistan's notable contribution of 0.50 per cent to global carbon emissions.

These innovative initiatives contribute to environmental conservation and are anticipated to generate the necessary funds for combating climate change in a region grappling with its profound consequences.

4,Afghan refugees and Pakistan: separating fact from fiction,"Hosting refugees and security imperatives, there’s a strong case for repatriation to Afghanistan",,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2452409/afghan-refugees-and-pakistan-separating-fact-from-fiction,national,2024-01-07,
5,The Kunar River rift,Afghan Taliban’s plan to build a dam on the Kunar River cause of worry for the two sides,"With Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers already tense over their inaction against terror havens, the latter may be about to kick another potential hornets’ nest. The Emirate-e-Islami Afghanistan’s plan to begin building water reservoirs along the Kunar River in the province of the same name following the Qosh Tepa Canal's completion has sparked fresh worries in Islamabad.
The concerns, which come at a time when finger-pointing between the two sides is at an all-time high, were best reflected in a series of posts by Balochistan government’s spokesman Jan Achakzai on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. “The Afghan Taliban's unilateral decision to establish a dam on the Kunar River, also known as the Chitral River, will be considered a hostile act against Pakistan,” he wrote, adding that “If the Afghan Taliban proceeds with this dam without involving Pakistan, it will have severe consequences escalating tensions and potential conflict.”
Regardless of their intentions, the Afghan Taliban could find it difficult to carry on with dam-building without Pakistan in its corner. The dam initiative would require huge financial investment and the support of the international community, both of which the Taliban regime currently does not have.
Islamabad announced a major policy shift in November last year, deciding it would cease advocating the Afghan Taliban’s case at the international level or extend any other assistance following failure of the Kabul authorities to neutralise the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The dam announcement, as such, could be a response to both that move and the repatriation of Afghan refugees as the Taliban regime seeks to strengthen its hand in negotiations.
Tracing the source
Pakistan and Afghanistan share nine river basins, including three in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and six in Balochistan. The K-P rivers — Kabul, Gomal, and Kurram — flow from Afghanistan into the province. The Balochistan rivers include Pishin-Lora, Kandahar-Kand, Kadanai, Abdul Wahab stream and Kaiser River.
These basins are incredibly rich, with most of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's population residing around them. Additionally, over one-third of Afghanistan's population, totalling more than 43 million people, resides around these basins.
Collectively, the basins not only meet the needs of a sizeable population in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, but also in other neighbouring countries such as Iran, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Their strategic significance lies in the fact that almost all the populations of Afghanistan's neighboring countries rely solely on these rivers.
The Kabul River originates in Mastuj at Broghil Pass in Pakistan, referred to as the Mastuj River in Upper Chitral and as the Chitral River in Lower Chitral. Upon reaching Arundo at Chitral Lowari Tunnel, it enters Afghanistan's Kunar province and becomes the Kunar River. It merges with the Kabul nullah at Jalalabad, from whereon it is referred to as the Kabul River, and re-enters Pakistan at the Mohmand district.
About 80 per cent of the river remains in Afghanistan, while 20 per cent flows into Pakistan. Mastuj comprises more than fifty per cent of the Kabul River, making it a unique river in the world. Simultaneously, Afghanistan and Pakistan are both upstream and downstream, as well as upper and lower riparian.
During the signing of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan and India included all rivers except the Kabul River, even though it converges with the Indus in Attock district. Afghanistan was not invited to be a part of that treaty and no other treaties on rivers were ever discussed between Kabul and Islamabad.
Unpacking water politics
It is a fact that Afghanistan serves as a significant water source for the region, and that its neighbouring countries grapple with water shortages. Afghanistan believes that it has ‘sole sovereignty over the water utilities’ of basin and that it has full authority over its use, storage, diversion, or wastage, sources told The Express Tribune. On the other hand, Pakistan and Iran, as lower riparian countries, assert claims based on historical presence and territorial integrity.
Historically, water usage was initially governed by customary practices, later influenced by colonial legacies, and upon Pakistan's formation, the border drawn between the two sides that Afghanistan never mutually accepted. There exists no water treaty between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the current water usage being guided by customary practices.
However, Iran and Afghanistan have a treaty from 1973, allocating Iran a fixed ratio of water at 22 cubic meters per second, along with 4 cubic meters per second as goodwill gestures.
While Afghanistan claims to retain the right to construct dams and reservoirs based on sovereignty formulas, a ""benefit-sharing formula"" could mutually benefit both countries. International donor agencies have also sponsored such trans-border river projects on the global stage. Studies have also stressed that the issues faced by Pakistan and Iran predominantly stem from poor water management at domestic levels.
Notably, the disputes between Iran-Afghanistan and Pakistan-Afghanistan are primarily political rather than centred on water disputes. The waterways that flow into Pakistan and Iran from Afghanistan contribute significantly to regional agriculture, supplement water levels, create ponds, facilitate transportation and assist in managing waste. Their sources primarily rely on rainwater and glacier melting. However, climate change has drastically altered weather patterns, posing a severe threat to the region's water politics.
Working towards a solution
First, it's crucial to question whether Afghanistan truly needs a dam. Constructing a dam downstream on the Kabul River would be ""useless,"" Dr Shakeel Hayat, the author of two books on shared waters between Afghanistan and Pakistan, told The Express Tribune. The energy generated wouldn't find much use due to low power consumption in the region. Selling excess energy is a challenge, he highlighted.
""For irrigation purposes, it's also ineffective,"" he continued, pointing out that the river passes through 18 districts and seven provinces where agriculture isn't substantial. Furthermore, floods recurrently affect these lands, making it impossible to transfer water to nearby provinces.
Moreover, in a worst-case scenario, constructing the dam wouldn't prevent annual floods but might exacerbate them, becoming an environmental hazard for the region, cautioned Dr Shakeel. In response to the dam, Pakistan could also consider diverting Chitral waters at the Arundo point into its territory, as this notion finds popularity in the area.
Strategically, Afghanistan could generate cheaper energy using their reservoirs. However, the majority of irrigation in downstream K-P depends on the Kabul River. Pakistan faces energy shortages, while Afghanistan heavily relies on food supplies, with around eighty per cent coming from Pakistan, K-P in particular.
A potential solution lies in an agreement between the two sides. K-P could provide food supplies to Afghanistan, while Afghanistan could supply energy to K-P and merged districts, establishing a bartering trade system.
However, if Afghanistan insists on absolute sovereignty, it might pose threats to the region's ecology. Pakistan, situated upstream in Chitral, could divert water to the Swat River in response. The best resolution would be for both countries to avoid using this issue for political leverage and instead adopt a mutually beneficial formula that serves both sides.

9,No information about Imran’s role in May 9 riots: PM,Kakar said all fugitives will face legal hurdles until they surrender to law,"Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar said on Sunday that the people, who were in hiding in the wake of May 9 violence, last year, would continue to face legal hurdles until they surrendered themselves to the law.
According to Express News, Kakar stressed that military trial could be held during the tenure of the caretaker government. He repeated his earlier stance that only those responsible for the violence should be punished and not the entire party.
May 9 riots refer to the attacks on state installations last year, following the arrest of then Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan in a corruption case. The installations, which were attacked, included the army’s General Headquarters in Rawalpindi corps commander house in Lahore.
When asked about the PTI founder's personal involvement in the events of May 9, the prime minister said in an interview that so far, he did not have the information to form such an opinion. “Before forming an opinion, I understand that this is a judicial process,” he said.
Kakar emphasised that intelligence reports varied and punishment could not be determined on their basis. However, he added: “Many are in hiding after the events of May 9. Until they surrender to the law, there will be legal obstacles in their political activities.”
On Friday, the government announced the formation of a committee to investigate the May 9 riots. The prime minister said that the outcome of the investigation would be shared with the nation by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) once it was completed.

On a personal note, the prime minister said that he voted for the PTI in the 2013 and 2018 elections but now he would not vote for it in the coming general election scheduled for February 8. He added that he changed his mind after seeing the PTI performance during its three-and-a-half years in government.
“I voted for the PTI in the hope that it would solve the governance challenges. Unfortunately, in three to three-and a-half-years, my opinion changed. PTI had no team and no preparation,” Kakar said referring to the PTI government after the 2018 elections until its removal in April last year.
About the February vote, Kakar said as soon as the election results came, uncertainty would end. “Who will form the government, it is for the people to decide,” he emphasised. “Whoever, even the PTI, forms the government, we will hand over the power,” he said.
When asked if it had been decided that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz would be brought to power, the prime minister stated that he had no knowledge of any such thing. “It is up to the people to decide.   We don’t have any choice. We have no personal problem with anyone.”
Responding to a question about the situation in Balochistan, the home province of the prime minister, Kakar said that Brahmadagh Bugti wanted to make an independent Balochistan state and added that “in such a case, let history decide whether someone calls them traitors or not.”
