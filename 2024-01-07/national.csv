1,Salaried class has high tax share,"Workers contribute more than exporters at Rs158b, marking 38% increase","Pakistan’s inflation-burdened salaried class remained the fourth-largest income tax contributor during the first half of this fiscal year, paying Rs158 billion in taxes—a sum now 243% higher than the tax contribution by the richest subsidised exporters.
There was a 38% increase in income tax collection from the salaried class during the July-December period of this fiscal year compared to a year ago, according to data compiled by the Federal Board of Revenue.
The salaried class’s tax contribution significantly increased amid a one-month-old recommendation by a technical mission of the International Monetary Fund to further increase the tax burden on salaried individuals.
Out of Rs158 billion, an amount of Rs66 billion or 42% of the salaried class’s contribution came from those persons registered in the province of Sindh. People living in one city are often registered for tax purposes in the cities where their companies have headquarters.
FBR data showed that during the first half of fiscal year 2023-24, salaried persons paid nearly Rs158 billion in taxes. The amount paid by the salaried class was Rs43.4 billion or 38% higher than the preceding year.
In the last fiscal year, salaried persons had paid Rs264 billion in taxes, and the current trend suggests that their contribution crossed well over Rs300 billion in this fiscal year.
Salaried people remained the fourth-largest contributors to withholding taxes after contractors, bank depositors, and importers. In the budget, the government, for the second time in one year, increased taxes on salaried people earning more than Rs200,000 a month.
Last month, the IMF urged Pakistan to cut the number of tax slabs for the salaried and business class from the existing seven to four—a proposal, if accepted, will hurt the middle and upper-middle-income groups. The proposal was floated by a technical mission of the IMF that completed its two-week review of Pakistan’s tax policies in December.
The IMF Resident Representative Esther Perez did not respond to a query regarding the recommendation of the technical mission to reduce the number of personal income tax slabs. But she had told Reuters that there was no such proposal at this stage. The Express Tribune had reported that the IMF’s recommendation would become the base for the next budget.
The salaried class’s tax burden has been increased at a time when inflation remains at one of the highest levels, and people’s purchasing power has significantly shrunk due to a massive increase in prices of electricity, gas, heating, and food.
During the first half of this fiscal year, the FBR collected over Rs1.25 trillion on account of withholding taxes, which were equal to 57% of the total income tax that the FBR generated during the period under review.
Read Salaried class pays nearly 200% more tax than exporters, retailers
The FBR is now in the process of expanding the tax base to the under-taxed sector and is expected to target about one million non-filers doing business in the country.
The maximum amount of income tax collected was from contractors, saving account holders, importers, salaried persons, electricity bills of non-filers, telephone & mobile phone users, and dividend income.
But exporters paid only Rs46 billion in taxes during the first half—an amount that was 243% less than the tax contribution of salaried persons.
Exporters earned $15 billion in the first half or Rs4.3 trillion but got away with paying only Rs46 billion in taxes at a rate of 1%. Exporters’ representatives claimed that their effective rate was almost equal to the salaried class’s maximum rate of 35%. The claim is not independently verified.
The IMF is also wrongly putting more burden on the salaried class, which, unlike the exporters and retailers, does not have a voice in the power corridors.
Tax collection from contractors and service providers jumped by 31% to Rs228 billion in the first half of this fiscal year—the highest contribution.
The collection on account of profit on debt jumped 58% to Rs220 billion in six months. The increase suggests the impact of higher interest rates and people’s tendency to save money. Banks charge 10% to 50% income tax rates on these savings accounts on behalf of the FBR.
Importers paid Rs189 billion in income tax on various types of imports—the third-largest contributor to withholding taxes.
Provincial share
Out of Rs158 billion salaried tax collections, Rs66 billion or 42% was collected by field formations of the FBR based in Sindh. People registered with Karachi tax offices paid the highest amount of Rs57 billion or 36% of the salaried taxes.
Punjab-registered taxpayers contributed Rs59.4 billion or 38% of the salaried tax with the share of Lahore standing at nearly Rs33 billion. Islamabad tax offices collected Rs19 billion from the salaried persons. The contribution of Balochistan-registered salaried persons was Rs4.2 billion, and Rs9 billion was collected from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa registered salaried persons.

2,Food price index ends 2023 10% lower,Eases concerns over global food price inflation,"The United Nations food agency’s world price index ended last year about 10% below its 2022 level, with values in December also down from the previous month, helping further ease concerns over global food price inflation.
The Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 118.5 points in December, down 1.5% from November and 10.1% below December 2022 levels.
For 2023 as a whole, the index averaged 13.7% below year earlier levels, with only sugar prices higher over the period. The FAO’s sugar price index did, however, decline 16.6% in December from November.
Read Food prices continue to soar
This was “mainly driven by the strong pace of production in Brazil, along with reduced use of sugarcane for ethanol production in India,” the UN agency said in a statement.
The FAO’s cereal price index rose 1.5% in December from November, as wheat, maize, rice and barley prices all rose amid hindered shipments from major exporting countries.

3,SBP gives Rs1.25tr to meet funding needs of banks,"In turn, banks will lend money to govt to bridge budget shortfall","Pakistan’s central bank has injected Rs1.25 trillion into conventional and Shariah-compliant banks for up to 28 days apparently in an effort to overcome shortage of funds and meet financing demand from the cash-strapped government.
Besides, the Karachi Inter-bank Offered Rate (Kibor) – the six-month benchmark interest rate at which banks lend money to each other – dropped more than three percentage points to 21.38% on Friday compared to the recent peak of 24.70%.
The decline in Kibor suggests that the government’s reliance on bank borrowing may go down significantly, as it is borrowing mainly to bear the interest cost of debt.
Kibor is coming down following projection that the central bank will gradually cut its key policy rate by seven percentage points to 15% by the end of December 2024. The current high policy rate is a big reason for the elevated interest payments.
Secondly, the rate reduction will encourage the private sector to return to banks for their credit needs for initiating new projects and expanding the existing ones.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Akseer Research Director Mohammad Awais Ashraf said banks were short of liquidity and were unable to meet borrowing demand from the government, which required funds to bridge its budget deficit.
This situation forced the central bank to inject funds worth Rs1.25 trillion through open market operations (OMOs) on Friday.
The government is facing the budget gap mainly due to colossal interest payments and the cost of salaries for its employees and pensions for the retired people.
Ashraf recalled that the central bank had injected Rs8.5 trillion into the banking system at the outset of December 2023, which signaled that the deposits with banks were insufficient to meet the government’s high borrowing needs.
Banks had already lent around 85% of total deposits to the government by December 2023. According to the central bank, the government has planned to borrow around Rs8 trillion from banks between December 2023 and February 2024.
Ashraf pointed out that government borrowing from banks had continued to grow since July 2019 when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) asked it to stop borrowing from the central bank.
Under the mechanism, the central bank injects funds into banks through OMOs and then banks lend to the government through the purchase of debt instruments such as T-bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs).

The government’s reliance on domestic commercial borrowing has remained high, though the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected higher revenues in the first six months of FY24 as compared to the IMF’s targets. Growing expenditures of the government have prompted it to borrow from banks.
The demand for credit from the private sector is next to nothing because of interest rate spike. Rather they are retiring their old debt.
The central bank has left its policy rate unchanged at the peak of 22% since July 2023, discouraging the private sector from borrowing to set up new factories or extend the existing production lines.
The government has restricted private sector growth in an effort to slow down the soaring inflation recorded at 29.7% in December 2023.
The Ministry of Finance, in its Economic Outlook for December 2023, said “private sector has retired Rs45.5 billion in the first five months (Jul-Nov) of the current fiscal year as compared to borrowing of Rs86 billion in the same period of last year”.
Topline Securities CEO Muhammad Sohail said the other day on social media platform X that interest rate in Pakistan had already dropped 3%. He mentioned that the benchmark interest rate (six-month Kibor) had decreased from the recent peak of 24.7% to 21.5%. Though the State Bank has kept the policy rate unchanged at 22% since July 2023, there is a high probability that the rate will come down in the coming months. “We expect a 700-basis-point cut in the policy rate in 2024, from the current 22% to 15%.”

5,Cabinet proposes envoys can lead consultations,Proposal floated to avoid unnecessary costs on foreign travel,"Cabinet members have called for authorising the Pakistani ambassadors posted abroad to head bilateral political consultations in a bid to reduce travel expenses on officials going from the country for talks amid financial crunch.
A cabinet member suggested in a recent meeting that relevant ambassadors of Pakistani missions overseas should be nominated as the head of consultations to avoid unnecessary foreign travel costs because of the financial constraints faced by the government.
He added that for countries having more strategic importance, the ministers concerned could lead the consultations.
In response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasised that such institutional arrangements reflected a deeper engagement and higher importance for bilateral relations with a country through greater cooperation and, therefore, the representation by ambassadors, which was an everyday affair, would not signal the desired level of commitment.
However, the ministry agreed on the need for reduction in the frequency of such consultations, wherever possible.
Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefed the cabinet that the government’s ‘Engage Africa’ policy, which was one of the main pillars, was aimed at renewing focus on revitalising and qualitatively enhancing relations with the African continent. To this end, it was explained, instituting a regular bilateral political consultation mechanism was an important way of providing direction to the relationship and maintaining a steady momentum in the growth of bilateral cooperation.
The cabinet was informed that in this context a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on bilateral political consultations between the ministries of foreign affairs of Pakistan and Gambia had been agreed, which was also vetted by the Ministry of Law and Justice.

In terms of Rule 16(1)(h) of the Rules of Business 1973, approval of the cabinet was solicited for signing the MoU between Pakistan and Gambia.
The cabinet was apprised that while the government of Pakistan had a number of such arrangements with other countries, the proposed MoU would be the first such institutional arrangement with Gambia.
Pakistan has had cordial foreign relations with Gambia since 1965 and it attaches importance to the strengthening of cooperation with the African nation.
Responding to a question, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the head of consultative groups was either a director general or an additional secretary, depending on the level of engagement.
The cabinet considered a summary titled “MoU on Bilateral Political Consultations between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan and Gambia,” submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and approved the proposal.

6,"Power tariff hike to dent trade, industry",Businessmen say outages already hitting manufacturing sector hard,"Businessmen and industrialists have expressed deep concern over another increase in power tariff and demanded that the government withdraw its decision that will deal a big blow to trade and industry.
In a statement, Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) President Kashif Anwar and other office-bearers pointed out that the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) had jacked up power tariff by Rs4.12 per unit on account of fuel charges adjustment for November 2023 and also issued a notification, which would inflate electricity bills of consumers.
They said that unannounced load-shedding was adding fuel to the fire and hitting the manufacturing sector hard.
“The repeated hike in power tariff is hurting exports and local businesses alike. Above all, the rupee-dollar parity is still beyond the capacity of manufacturers,” the statement quoted the business leaders as saying.
Terming the frequent increase in electricity prices by the government “sheer injustice”, the LCCI office-bearers said that a majority of people had been sent bills many times more than their monthly income.
Read Power tariff upped by Rs3 for Oct
They called for putting an end to free electricity facility for all segments immediately till the time economic challenges were addressed and the debt burden eased as “currently we cannot afford such facilities”.
They were of the view that electricity was the main raw material for industries; if such anti-industry measures were not avoided, the manufacturing sector would be completely destroyed and the country would only become a trading place.
Despite the massive increase in electricity prices, the circular debt in the energy chain could not be controlled while the energy crisis worsened, due to which industrial production would fall to the lowest level.
According to the industrialists, the cost of electricity in Pakistan is already very high compared to other countries in the region and as a result Pakistani products will not be able to compete in the international market.
Pakistan has already lost much of the global market to China, Bangladesh and India due to its high production costs.

7,"Despite volatility, PSX achieves high growth","KSE-100 index rises 2,064 points, or 3.3% WoW, settles at 64,514.90","Pakistan’s stocks started 2024 on an upbeat note and showed considerable resilience as they added over 2,000 points despite worries about political developments ahead of general elections in early February.
A substantial increase in the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) tax collection, continuous growth in the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) foreign currency reserves, substantial fall in the country’s trade deficit and a stable rupee provided critical support to the stock market.
During the week, investors rebalanced their portfolios and also resorted to profit-taking. On the first trading day of the new calendar year, Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) enjoyed a remarkable rally of over 2,200 points, propelled by investor enthusiasm about the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) initiatives, coupled with anticipation of economic reforms by the incoming government.
Next day, the KSE-100 index experienced a downturn primarily owing to dismal data revealing that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surged to 29.7% year-on-year (YoY) in December 2023.
On Wednesday, despite facing a mixed trend, the index gained 297 points on reports of 22% YoY surge in exports to $2.81 billion, which pushed trade deficit 40% lower at $1.7 billion. The bourse closed flat on Thursday in the absence of positive triggers that significantly impacted investor interest in building their positions.
A wave of uncertainty engulfed the market on Friday, triggered by unexpected political shifts. The index recorded significant fluctuations as news surfaced that the Senate had approved a resolution seeking delay in general elections. The index recorded a decrease of 124 points.
Overall, the benchmark KSE-100 index gained 2,064 points, or 3.3% week-on-week (WoW), and settled at 64,514.90.
JS Global analyst Shagufta Irshad, in her review, said that the KSE-100 exhibited continued volatility while entering the new year where it saw a mix of profit-taking and rebalancing of portfolios.
Average daily traded volumes increased by 5% while traded value in US dollar terms rose by 12%. “Upcoming elections remained a central focus, with political news dominating headlines,” she said.
Read PSX prepares for first IPO of 2024
Key developments included cases involving a potential lifetime ban on members of parliament, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) commitment to participating in elections regardless of cases against its founder and assurances from institutions about timely elections. On the macroeconomic front, the SBP’s forex reserves crossed $8.2 billion. CPI reading stood at 29.7% for December 2023 whereas tax collection for 1HFY24 remained above target at Rs4.47 trillion.
Besides, the government decided to keep petroleum product prices unchanged for the current fortnight. In other news, exports rebounded to a 19-month high, recording 22% YoY growth at $2.8 billion for December. Cement sales also took a positive turn with 5% YoY growth, the JS analyst added.
Arif Habib Limited, in its report, noted that in the first week of the new year, the stock market displayed notable resilience, experiencing a surge of 2,211 points on Monday – the second-highest point increase.
Moreover, positive economic indicators were evident as the FBR made a historic one-month tax collection of Rs984 billion, coupled with a substantial 40% YoY reduction in trade deficit for December.
However, the elevated headline inflation at 29.7% raised some investor concerns. On a positive note, the SBP’s reserves reached $8.2 billion, the highest level since July 14, 2023. Moreover, the rupee strengthened Rs0.46, or 0.16%, clocking in at Rs281.4/$.
Sector-wise, positive contribution came from oil and gas exploration companies (587 points), commercial banks (392 points), fertiliser (315 points), cement (185 points) and power generation and distribution (166 points).
Stock-wise, positive contributors were Pakistan Petroleum (268 points), Oil and Gas Development Company (258 points), Fauji Fertiliser Co (151 points), Hub Power (120 points) and United Bank (102 points).
During the week under review, foreign investors sold shares valuing at $3.1 million compared to net selling of $1.9 million last week.

9,Hub industrialists seek energy supply,Lament that step-motherly attitude towards Hub city has resulted in crisis,"Industrialists in Hub, Balochistan, are urging both the provincial and federal governments to address critical issues affecting the Hub Industrial and Trading Estate (HITE). The industrialists emphasise the need for consistent gas supply with proper pressure, improved road connectivity between Karachi and Hub, and the urgent rehabilitation of the deteriorating infrastructure in the organised industrial zone.
Expressing their concerns, the industrialists highlight the neglect of a major bridge connecting Sindh and Balochistan for the past one and a half years. They contend that the rehabilitation, which could be completed within four months, has been delayed unnecessarily, causing disruptions in transportation and hindering economic activities.
One of the prominent figures in the industrial community and President of the Lasbela Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Ismail Suttar, stresses the importance of addressing these issues. He underscored the need for proper gas supply, highlighting that new gas connections are not being provided, and industrialists are being directed to opt for Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) connections at a higher cost. According to Suttar, RLNG costs Rs3,950 per mmBtu (million British thermal units), while regular gas connections cost Rs1,350 per mmBtu. He lamented that Balochistan produces approximately 18% to 20% natural gas but only 6% is provided to the province for consumption. Suttar called for the implementation of Article 158 of the Constitution, which aims to ensure the fair distribution of gas resources and benefit the local population.
HITE, spanning 1,300 acres and housing around 200 national and multinational industries, faces numerous challenges, including energy shortages and utility problems. The industrialists argue that the step-motherly attitude towards Hub City has resulted in energy crises, hindering both industrialists and local residents.

Maqsood Ismail, another leading industrialist in Hub, highlighted the acute shortage of water in the region. He pointed out that despite the presence of ample water in Hub Dam, issues such as water theft and evaporation persist due to the lack of a proper water supply channel. Ismail urged the government to lay water pipelines to supply water to Hub City and the HITE, aiming to eliminate reliance on water tankers and reduce water-related challenges.
The industrialists believe that addressing these fundamental issues will unlock the tremendous potential of the HITE to accommodate more industries and create new opportunities for industrialists in the country. They underscore the need for the government to allocate funds for the rehabilitation of HITE, emphasising the positive impact it can have on the region’s prosperity and job creation.
Despite these challenges, the industrialists express gratitude for the peaceful law and order situation in the region, highlighting the potential for setting up more industries in Hub. The LCCI, representing the business community of the district, plays a pivotal role in advocating for the resolution of these longstanding issues and fostering economic growth in Balochistan.
