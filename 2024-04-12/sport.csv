UDINE: Inter Milan took another step towards the Serie A title as a last-gasp goal from Davide Frattesi secured a 2-1 come-from-behind win at struggling Udinese on Monday. 
Five minutes into added time, Lautaro Martinez unleashed a low shot that Udinese goalkeeper Maduka Okoye managed to tip onto the post but Italy midfielder Frattesi pounced to slot home the rebound. 
Udinese had stunned the visitors with a soft goal by Lazar Samardzic before the break but Inter were soon level when Hakan Calhanoglu converted a penalty 10 minutes into the second half. 
Runaway leaders Inter are 14 points clear of second-placed AC Milan, boasting 82 points with seven rounds remaining. 
“We absolutely don’t think we’ve won it yet. We have other matches to play and we need to go out and get it,” said Frattesi to Sky Sport. “I’m really happy, it’s a really big win towards we need to do. You can’t win every match 4-0, it’s important that you also manage to win the tough matches.” 
Monday’s win ensured that the champions-elect could seal their 20th Scudetto in a hotly-anticipated derby with their local rivals Milan in a fortnight’s time. 
Claiming the league crown with a sixth straight derby win would be some revenge for Calhanoglu who is detested by Milan supporters after switching sides of the northern Italian city three years ago. 
“In all honesty I don’t like talking about the other side from where I came,” said Calhanoglu. “I respect them and I have a good relationship with the players. What happened in my first year here is history. I’m concentrated on my teammates because they’re fantastic... That’s what matters.” 
For relegation-threatened Udinese, the late goal was like a dagger to the heart of their hard-working defence with the side in 15th place with 28 points, two points above the drop zone. 
“How the game ended really hurts,” Samardzic said. “The point would have mattered a lot but we must look forward with our heads held high and do better in our coming games.”   
Udinese’s defeat after a valiant defensive effort brought sympathy from Inter manager Simone Inzaghi. 
“I would like to congratulate Udinese, they played a great match and losing like this is annoying. But I think they can be saved with their organisation,” Inzaghi told Sky Sports Italia. 
Inzaghi emphasised that his side needed to stay focused on winning a 20th Scudetto and a coveted second star, which is awarded for each 10 titles and is almost within reach. 
“We respected the opponent but we put our heart into, also driven by our fans. We believed and never gave up,” he added. “We have achieved 26 victories in 31 games. A great run. Now we have to stay clear. There is great harmony, everyone helps each other. Eight points to go.”

1,FIFA resolves lawsuit by  sports promoter owned by billionaire Ross,NEW YORK: FIFA has settled an antitrust lawsuit accusing football’s world governing body of illegally banning...,"NEW YORK: FIFA has settled an antitrust lawsuit accusing football’s world governing body of illegally banning foreign clubs and leagues from staging official matches in the United States.
The settlement with Relevent Sports, a sports promoter controlled by billionaire Miami Dolphins American football team owner Stephen Ross, was disclosed in a Monday filing with the US District Court in Manhattan.
It came a little over a year after the federal appeals court in Manhattan revived Relevent’s case, which a trial judge had dismissed in 2021. The US Soccer Federation remains a defendant.
Lawyers for FIFA and US Football did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In a statement, Relevent said FIFA will consider changes to its rules about whether games can be played outside a league’s home territory.
Some European and South American teams already play  “friendly” matches in the United States.
It was not immediately clear whether the settlement would result in non-US teams playing regular season matches there.
FIFA, which has 211 member associations, announced its foreign match policy in October 2018, after Relevent arranged with Spain’s La Liga to host a regular season match between FC Barcelona and Girona FC in Miami.
Barcelona eventually withdrew, and Relevent sued US Soccer in September 2019 after it scuttled a match in Miami between two Ecuadorean teams. FIFA was added as a defendant a year later.
Relevent, based in New York, also operates the International Champions Cup.
The hosting by US stadiums of regular season matches between foreign teams could draw away fans and sponsors now supporting FIFA-affiliated Major League Soccer.
That league got a boost when soccer star Lionel Messi, who helped Argentina win the 2022 World Cup, began playing for Inter Miami last year.
The United States, along with Canada and Mexico, will co-host the World Cup in men’s football in 2026.
The case is Relevent Sports LLC v US Soccer Federation Inc et al, US District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-08359.

2,Football director Murtough to leave Manchester United,"LONDON: John Murtough is to step down as football director of Manchester United and leave Old Trafford, the ...","LONDON: John Murtough is to step down as football director of Manchester United and leave Old Trafford, the faltering Premier League giants said on Tuesday.
United are overhauling their structure following Jim Ratcliffe’s acquisition of a 25 per cent stake in the club, which saw the chairman of chemicals giant INEOS take control of football operations.
Ratcliffe is especially keen to overhaul recruitment at United, with the club reportedly looking to bring in Newcastle sporting director Dan Ashworth and Southampton director of football Jason Wilcox as members of a new leadership team, with Murtough’s exit described as a  “mutual” decision.
“John Murtough is to step down from his position as Football Director of Manchester United and leave the club after almost 11 years in a variety of roles at Carrington (the club’s training ground),” said a United statement.
Ratcliffe added:  “We want to thank John for his loyal service over many years, and for his support and integrity during this period of transition. He leaves with our best wishes for the future.”
United co-chairman Joel Glazer said:  “After 11 years of tireless work for the club, John has mutually agreed with us that now is the right time to step aside and allow the new football leadership structure to be put in place.”
United’s 2-2 draw at home to Liverpool left the Red Devils sixth in the Premier League table, but 11 points behind fifth-placed Aston Villa in the race for European football.
United still have a chance to win a trophy this season after coming from 2-1 and 3-2 down to beat Liverpool 4-3 in a thrilling FA Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford that secured a last-four tie with second-tier Coventry.

The Danish Visma-Lease a Bike rider was hospitalised after suffering rib and collarbone fractures and sustaining lung damage in the shocking incident during the Tour of the Basque Country race.
Vingegaard, 27, who won the Tour de France in 2022 and 2023, is hoping to complete a hat-trick of victories this summer but the crash has put his participation under significant doubt.
“Jonas had a successful operation on his collarbone,” said Visma on social media network X.
“He will now spend the next few weeks recovering. It is not yet clear how long this will take.
“He is doing well and expresses his gratitude to everyone for their kind words over the past few days.”
Remco Evenepoel also broke his collarbone in the crash on stage four of the race in northern Spain, while leader Primoz Roglic retired after he was also fell, along with several other riders, but the Slovenian did not sustain any fractures.
Visma’s other rider Wout van Aert broke his collarbone and several ribs in a high-speed mass pile up during the Around Flanders one-day race.
Last week Visma chief Richard Plugge said cyc­ling needed to take action to keep riders safer.

The 20-day tournament featured 63 matches, equally shared by host venues Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, before culminating on Monday.
Jinnah College emerged victorious in the Karachi-leg event by defeating Government College 36-B Landhi at Eid Gah Stadium by three wickets, while Punjab College clinched the trophy at the LCCA ground by triumphing over Government College University by six wickets. In Islamabad, IMPCC College H-8/4 claimed the title when they defeated Westminster by 63 runs. 
“I assure you that we will organise an even grander and more elaborate tournament next year, encompassing more teams, venues, cities, incentives and rewards,” Mohsin said in a statement on Tuesday. 
“One of the immediate successes of this tournament is the selection of a significant number of players by district teams. 
“These players would have missed out on this opportunity if it weren’t for this tournament.”

The FIFA-appointed PFF NC announced on Tuesday that will hold the National Women’s Football Championship next month which will feature clubs only. With the winners of the women’s championship carrying a vote in the PFF Congress, the move has added fuel to widespread murmurs in the local football fraternity that the Haroon Malik-led NC is trying to influence the elections it will hold.
Pakistan Army, a departmental side, are the current holders of the National Women’s Championship — a title they won when the last completed edition of the event was held in 2020.
“The inclusion of clubs only points to something fishy,” a source close to the matter told Dawn. “There are already question marks over the elections of the Pakistan Football Referees Association.”
The PFRA also carries a vote in the PFF Congress and sources claim that by restricting the women’s championship to clubs only, “the NC is looking to get another vote for its favoured presidential candidate”.
The PFF said that the women’s championship will run from May 5 to May 21 in Karachi.
“The National Women’s Football Championship (NWFC) is set to commence on May 5, 2024 in Karachi,” read a PFF news release “ The clubs that have registered by December 2023 will be eligible to participate in the extravaganza, showcasing the passion for women’s football across Pakistan.
“Being organised by the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF), the championship will see the participating teams divided into four groups. With the top two teams from each group advancing to the quarter-finals.
“The championship will culminate in a finale scheduled to take place on May 21, 2024, where the top contenders will vie for the coveted title of champions. The PFF has extended invitations to all participating clubs, eagerly awaiting their confirmations to finalize the draw and unveil the match schedule along with the designated venues in the coming days.”

Alcaraz, who successfully defended his Indian Wells title last month before losing to Grigor Dimitrov in the Miami Open quarter-finals, was due to face Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime.
Alcaraz may also have an eye on his preparation ahead of the French Open, which begins on May 20.
“I have been working in Monte Carlo and trying to recover until the last minute from an injured pronator teres in my right arm, but it was not possible and I cannot play,” Alcaraz posted on social media. “I was really looking forward to playing See you next year.”

Humbert went out in the first round last year to Italian wildcard Lorenzo Sonego and, after losing the first set to Argentine Coria, the French 14th seed looked in trouble again.
The 25-year-old overcame the setback though and strolled to win the next two sets, breaking Coria’s serve twice in each set.
Karen Khachanov was also made to battle before overcoming Britain’s Cameron Norrie 7-5, 7-6(3). The Russian 15th seed had his serve broken twice in the opening set and was forced into a tiebreak in the second.
Norrie again broke serve twice in the second and at 6-5 up had two break points to win the set but Khachanov hit back with three consecutive aces to hold serve and fired another two aces to take the tiebreak with ease.
Khachanov will face Argentine Francisco Cerundolo in the second round.
Bulgarian ninth seed Grigor Dimitrov, who recently lost the Miami Open final to Jannik Sinner, came through his first-round match with local wildcard Valentin Vacherot by 7-5, 6-2.
Dimitrov, who won his first ATP title in over six years at the Brisbane International in January, was pushed hard in the first set with Vacherot breaking serve in the opening game, but found his groove to ease to victory in the second set.
“I’m just grateful that I was able to get through the match today like that. I know I’m far away from my game right now, but hopefully this is a build-up for me,” Dimitrov said.
Twice Monte Carlo champion Stefanos Tsitsipas is also through to the second round after his opponent Laslo Djere retired injured in the second set. Tsitsipas won the opening set 6-3 and was 3-2 up when the Serb announced his withdrawal.
“I didn’t expect such a finish. This is not something very common when I play,” Greek 12th seed Tsitsipas said.
“I did my job well, and obviously, I’m wishing [Djere a] speedy recovery, because injuries are not fun.”
The top eight seeds received byes to the second round, and Tuesday will see world number one Novak Djokovic in action against Russia’s Roman Safiullin.

8,"Amir, Imad and Usman picked for New Zealand T20 series","LAHORE: Fast bowler Mohammad Amir, all-rounder Imad Wasim along with uncapped players Usman Khan and Mohammad Irfan...","

LAHORE: (From L) Members of the selection committee Asad Shafiq, Abdul Razzaq, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Yousuf and Bilal Afzal address a press conference here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Tuesday.—M. Arif/White Star

 
LAHORE: Fast bowler Mohammad Amir, all-rounder Imad Wasim along with uncapped players Usman Khan and Mohammad Irfan Khan Niazi were named in a 17-member Pakistan T20 squad that was announced by a newly-appointed selection committee on Tuesday for the forthcoming five-match home series against New Zealand. 
Frontline pace bowler Naseem Shah, experienced all-rounder Shadab Khan and mystery spinner Abrar Ahmed also returned to the squad after recovering from injuries and proving their fitness in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) held in February-March. 
The New Zealand series is scheduled to be staged in Rawalpindi and Lahore from April 18 to 27. 
The New Zealand squad is due to arrive in Rawalpindi which will host the first three matches at the Pindi Cricket Stadium while the last two will be held at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore.
The players, who were part of the Pakistan squad which toured New Zealand in January this year, but missed out on the forthcoming series include pacers Haris Rauf (fitness), Aamer Jamal and Wasim Junior, left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz, top-order batter Sahibzada Farhan and wicket-keeper Haseebullah Khan.
“It is the first function of this selection committee and we [five] selectors along with captain and head coach [Azhar Mahmood] decided the team with mutual understanding. The criterion was drafted keeping in view the World Cup as target and every player could see the rotation policy, considering the workload on the player,” Wahab Riaz, a member of the selection committee and senior team manager, said while announcing the squad during a presser at the Gaddafi Stadium on Tuesday.
Sitting in the middle at the presser, Wahab was flanked by fellow selectors inc­luding former Test cricketers Moha­mmad Yousuf, Abdul Razzaq and Asad Shafiq, and Bilal Afzal who is part of the selection body functioning as a data analyst.
Interestingly, Babar Azam, who was re-installed as T20 captain recently after former skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi was removed after just one series at the helm as Pakistan were drubbed 4-1 in New Zealand, and newly appointed head coach Azhar Mahmood, were not present at the presser as members of the selection committee.
“A day earlier, we held a discussion with all the 29 probables who attended a fitness camp in Kakul, saying to them ‘congratulations will be to those who will be selected and who could not get the nod will remain the part [of the system] in the future’.
“We have selected the best team having the input of the captain and the coach,” Wahab added.
Wahab defended the decision to pick Amir and Imad — both of whom had reversed their retirement decisions last month — for national duty.
“The decision to include Imad and Amir was a straightforward one, given their availability for selection and considering [pacer] Haris’s injury and Nawaz’s current form. Both Amir and Imad possess undeniable match-winning capabilities, and we trust they will consistently deliver strong performances to bolster the team’s objectives,” Wahab said.
Orthodox left-arm spinner Imad has played 66 T20 Internationals in which he has scored 486 runs at a strike-rate of 131.7 and taken 65 wickets at an economy-rate of 6.26. He last played for Pakistan 12 months ago at his home ground in Rawalpindi against New Zealand.
Left-armer Amir, who last played for Pakistan in August 2020 at Old Trafford against England, has played in 50 T20Is in which he has taken 59 wickets at an economy-rate of 7.02.
Wahab hoped that Haris would be available for next month’s T20 tour of England.
Wahab emphasised a specific selection policy, which at the moment was aimed at preparing the team for the all-important T20 World Cup scheduled for June this year. 
“We will follow a rotation policy to keep our players fit for the T20 World Cup which is our target,” said Wahab.
“We have communicated our overarching selection policy and strategy to all elite players, and there is complete alignment within the group. To ensure the policy’s implementation in letter and spirit, I will closely collaborate with the team management during the series,” he added.
“As we prepare for the T20 World Cup in the US and West Indies, this series holds significant importance for Pakistan. Rather than solely focusing on the formidable New Zealand side, we aim to introspect and identify areas for improvement. I anticipate that players will seize the opportunities presented to strengthen their claims for the World Cup.”
Wahab added, “The rotation policy could also be implemented on Babar.”
The 28-year-old Usman was included in Pakistan squad, just four days after he was banned by the Emirates Cricket Board.
He was the second highest run-scorer in the last PSL (430 runs in seven matches) while also on the books as a player in a United Arab Emirates (UAE) league.
The ECB charged him with breaching his obligations to the Board after he attended the Kakul training camp. He was eventually banned from playing cricket in the UAE for five years.
Wahab justified Usman’s selection.
“Usman has been scoring runs for the last two, three years so he deserved selection and if there are any other issues the Pakistan Cricket Board will be dealing with them,” Wahab said.
Delighted at his selection, Usman said he would try to grasp the opportunity with both hands.
“Being chosen to represent one’s country is the ultimate dream and goal for any athlete. Today, I am absolutely thrilled and filled with joy as the selectors have granted me the opportunity to be part of the upcoming series against New Zealand,” Usman, who represented Multan Sultans in the PSL, said.
“This selection validates the relentless effort and dedication I have poured into my craft, and I am fully committed to upholding the high standards I have set for myself.”
Right-handed Irfan was adjudged the Emerging Player and Best Fielder of this year’s HBL PSL after scoring 171 runs at a strike-rate of 140.16. Overall, the 21-year-old Mianwali-born player has featured in 34 T20s in which he has scored 499 runs at a strike-rate of 135.96. Irfan also represented Pakistan in the ICC U-19 World Cups in 2020 and 2022.
Speaking on his selection for the New Zealand series, Irfan said he would try to make a permanent place in the team with solid performances.
“I am deeply honoured to have been selected in the Pakistan squad for the upcoming T20 series against New Zealand. Breaking into such a formidable team like Pakistan is a testament to the dedication and effort I have put into my game. Now, my focus is on seizing this opportunity and solidifying my position within the team,” Irfan, a player of Karachi Kings franchise, said.
“I am fully committed to continuing to work diligently and proving myself worthy of the trust placed in me by the captain and selectors.”
Expressing his views at the press conference, former batting maestro Yousuf congratulated Usman and Irfan for getting selected in the national squad and hoped that they would give their best.
“Their selection is also a cause of inspiration for the other young players, who want to make a place in the Pakistan team,” he said.
To a question, Wahab said the selected players along with five reserves would be the nucleus for the selectors till the World Cup.
Answering a question regarding the responsibility of senior team manager whi­ch had been given to him for the first time, Wahab said PCB chairman Mohsin Raza Naqvi had already said that he would give additional responsibility to some officials 
“[As manager] I will see the team management affairs. Additionally, I will be observing, as a member of the selection body, the implementation of the selection policy during the [New Zealand] series.”
When it was pointed out to Yousuf that being the most senior cricketer among the selectors, he should lead the selection committee, the former middle-order batsman said, “It is a decision of the PCB which has decided to give all the members equal powers to take the decision through majority. It is good, as earlier all powers were held by the chief selector.”
Responding to a question on who would be the vice-captain, Wahab said the discussion on the subject was still under way.
To a query, Wahab termed former PCB chairman Ramiz Raja’s reported comment over Amir’s comeback to the national fold as negative.
Wahab said the negative reporting on social media had raised a perception that if a fitness camp in Kakul had not been set up the players would have remained in their ‘groups’, in the backdrop of the change in national T20 captaincy.
“It was witnessed in Kakul, how happy and united the players were with each other,” Wahab said.
When recalled that while few months ago when Babar was removed as captain both Wahab and Razzaq favoured the decision whereas now they were now backing the batter in the hot seat, Wahab said the decision of changing the skipper was based on workload management.
“Shaheen is Pakistan’s main strike bowler and one of the best in the world. To continue with the rotation policy, keeping in view the workload of Shaheen, who has faced fitness problems, it was decided to bring Babar back as captain as he is the most experienced batter, having the good experience of captaincy, and the team needs such a captain in the World Cup,” Wahab justified.
Speaking at the presser, Razzaq said, “Obviously when anyone watches players from outside it looks different. However, after becoming selector and watching the situation closely, I feel Babar is the best choice [as captain].”
Squad: Babar Azam (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Azam Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohmmad Amir, Mohammad Irfan Khan Niazi, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Usama Mir, Usman Khan, Zaman Khan. 
Non-travelling reserves: Haseebullah, Mohammad Ali, Mohammad Wasim Jr, Sahibzada Farhan, Salman Ali Agha.

9,CL host nations tighten security after Islamic State threats,PARIS: France and Spain will step up security ahead of the Champions League quarter-finals in Madrid and Paris on...,"PARIS: France and Spain will step up security ahead of the Champions League quarter-finals in Madrid and Paris on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, top officials said, as Islamic State threats cast a shadow over Europe’s top club football tournament. 
British police said they were aware of reports of threats and had a robust policing plan in place ahead of Arsenal’s match against Bayern Munich in London on Tuesday night. 
European football’s governing body UEFA said all four games in Paris, Madrid and London would go ahead despite the threat. 
The threats against some of the world’s most-watched football matches underline the resurgence of Islamic State after several deadly attacks this year, including in Iran and Moscow. They also point to the complex geopolitical backdrop to the world’s biggest single sporting event, the Olympic Games, set to take place in Paris in July and August. 
At a press event to discuss Olympic security on Tuesday, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters that security would be  “considerably reinforced” when Paris St Germain take on Barcelona in the first leg at the Parc des Princes in Paris on Wednesday. 
Darmanin said there had been “a clear threat publicly expressed by the Islamic State”. 
“The police, whom I spoke to very early this morning, have considerably reinforced the security measures,” he said. “We have seen, among other things, a communication from the Islamic State that particularly targets stadiums. It is not new. 
“This morning we asked the general director of interior security to communicate the information we have with the other [security] services of the other countries hosting the quarter-finals.” 
Islamic State published a post urging followers to recreate a November 2015 attack on the Stade de France stadium, according to Site Intelligence group, which tracks Islamic militant communications. 
“Recreate the glory of the Paris 2015 raid and subdue the Crusaders in masses,” said the post, which included an image of PSG’s Parc des Princes stadium. 
Real Madrid play Manchester City in the Spanish capital on Tuesday night as Arsenal take on Bayern Munich in London. Atletico Madrid then host Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night at the same time as PSG play Barcelona.  
PSG defender Danilo said he and his team-mates “need to concentrate on the football,” but coach Luis Enrique said the threat was worrying. 
“Of course, it’s worrying ... Who in this room isn’t worried?” Luis Enrique told reporters. “It’s something I hope can be controlled, and that they’re just threats and that nothing disastrous happens.”  
Spanish police forces will deploy more than 2,000 officers to boost security in the capital for the two games there, government spokesperson Pilar Alegria told reporters on Tuesday. 
“We are going to have an exceptional deployment of security services, in line with the level of alert set out by the intelligence services,” Francisco Martin Aguirre, the government’s delegate for Madrid, said in a video message. 
In London, the Metropolitan Police said it was aware of the calls to target matches. 
London police’s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said in a statement: “We’re aware of online and media reports in relation to calls to target matches across Europe and here in London. 
“However, I want to reassure the public that we have a robust policing plan in place for tonight’s match and we continue to work closely alongside the club’s security team to ensure that the match passes peacefully.” 
UEFA said all the matches would be played. 
“UEFA is aware of alleged terrorist threats made towards this week’s UEFA Champions League matches and is closely liaising with the authorities at the respective venues,” the statement said. 
“All matches are planned to go ahead as scheduled with appropriate security arrangements in place.” 
After being largely crushed by a US-led coalition, Islamic State has been operating in the shadows in recent years, slowly rebuilding its capabilities via underground sleeper cells. 
Its Afghan branch, known as ISIS-K, has been particularly active in recent months. The group claimed responsibility for a mass-fatality attack at a concert near Moscow last month, and also carried out twin bombings in Iran that killed nearly 100 people earlier this year, according to US-intercepted communications.

The first two of the three World Test Championship matches will be back-to back at Hagley Oval, Christchurch, from November 28 and at the Basin Reserve, Wellington, from December 6.
The third and final Test will be at Hamilton’s Seddon Park beginning December 14.
There were capacity crowds for the first three days of both of New Zealand’s recent home Tests against Australia and New Zealand Cricket (NZC) hope the five-day games against England will also bring in the fans in huge numbers. 
“In the past there’s often been a lot of talk in New Zealand about the popularity of Test cricket, without that translating into ticket sales,” said NZC chief executive Scott Weenink. 
“The difference over the past summer, and in terms of the upcoming Tests against England, is that the interest is being converted to bums on seats and is driving record viewership numbers. 
“We’re looking forward to that continuing.”

Northern Irishman McIlroy, the world number two, is looking to complete the career grand slam this week by claiming the green jacket that has eluded him so far in his career.
Top-ranked Scheffler tasted success at Augusta in 2022 and arrives on a hot streak after wins last month at the Arnold Palmer Championship and The Players Championship and a runner-up effort at the Houston Open.
The pair are joined by Tokyo Olympic gold medalist Xander Schauffele, who has yet to win a major championship but finished tied for second in the Masters in 2019.
The trio will tee off at 10.42 am local on Thursday, just minutes after defending champion Jon Rahm will begin his bid.
Rahm will play with England’s Matt Fitzpatrick, the 2022 US Open champion and American Nick Dunlap, who turned professional earlier this year after winning the American Express tournament on the PGA Tour in January.
Tiger Woods, a 15-time major winner, will make his 26th start at the Masters alongside Australian Jason Day and American Max Homa.
Immediately following McIlroy and Scheffler’s group will be a talented trio of reigning US Open champion Wyndham Clark, 2022 British Open champion Cameron Smith of Australia and Norwegian Viktor Hovland.

12,Olympic rings to be displayed on Eiffel Tower for Paris Games,Work to set the rings on the tower will begin at the end of the month after the Olympic torch has left ancient Olympia in Greece.,"PARIS: The Olympic rings for the Paris Games will be displayed on the Eiffel Tower, the president of the monument’s operating company (SETE) said.
Jean-Francois Martins said work to set the rings on the tower would begin at the end of the month after the Olympic torch has left ancient Olympia in Greece. The rings will be on the Seine side of the tower.
The Eiffel Tower will be a central part of the Paris Olympics, marking the 38km point of the marathon while the beach volleyball event will be held at its base.
The Olympic flame will be positioned at the Jardin des Tuileries, near the Louvre.

13,Paris closure plans unveiled ahead of Olympics,"PARIS: Large areas of central Paris will be out of bounds for most people a week ahead of the Olympics, with traffic...","PARIS: Large areas of central Paris will be out of bounds for most people a week ahead of the Olympics, with traffic allowed to cross the river Seine at only four locations, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on Tuesday.
In the week leading up to the opening ceremony, police will put in place a vast anti-terror zone stretching all along the river Seine which athletes are set to sail down when the Games begin on July 26.
Around 20,000 homes lie inside the zone and anyone wanting to enter it — including workers or tourists with a hotel or apartment reservation — will need to have registered beforehand on a government website to obtain a QR code.
“Parisians will have five ways of crossing Paris during the week of preparations for the opening ceremony, one pedestrian bridge... and four bridges open to pedestrians and traffic,” Darmanin told reporters.
The closures underline the scale of the security challenge posed by the hugely ambitious opening ceremony which will see teams sail down a 6.0-kilometre (3.7-mile) stretch of the river in more than 100 boats.
Crossing the capital on the underground metro system will still be possible, but around 15 stations inside the anti-terror zone will be closed.
The high-security zone will shrink after the opening ceremony to the areas in the immediate vicinity of sports venues, which are dotted around the capital.
“It will be a magnificent moment for France and for the Olympics,” Darmanin said of the opening ceremony, stressing that no country had ever organised one outside the main athletics stadium.
A total of 326,000 spectators are expected to witness the ceremony with tickets, while up to 200,000 others will watch from homes overlooking the Seine or from residential river boats.
