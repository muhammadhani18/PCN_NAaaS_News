Lavrov arrived in China for a two-day official visit on Monday, with the two countries looking to deepen diplomatic ties as Russia’s war in Ukraine grinds on.
Russia and China have in recent years ramped up contacts, and their strategic partnership has only grown closer since the invasion of Ukraine.
In meetings on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Wang Yi promised:  “China will support Russia’s stable development under the leadership of (Vladimir) Putin.”  “Beijing and Moscow will continue to strengthen strategic cooperation on the world stage and provide each other with strong support,” Wang said, according to the RIA Novosti news agency.
“Under the strong leadership of President Putin, the Russian people will have a bright future,” he said. Lavrov, in turn, thanked China for its  “support” after President Putin’s recent re-election, in which he was unchallenged by any meaningful opposition.
“Xi Jinping... was among the first ones to send congratulations to the president-elect Putin, and we are overall grateful to our Chinese friends for this support,” Lavrov said, according to a video of the meeting shared by Izvestia on Telegram.
“The election results confirmed the deep trust of the Russian people in our leader and the ongoing domestic and foreign policies,” he added, according to RIA Novosti.
“This applies not least to the course to strengthen strategic interaction and partnership with the PRC,” the top diplomat said, referring to China by its official acronym.
‘Clear-cut stand’
Lavrov last visited Beijing in October for an international forum on Chinese President Xi’s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. Analysts say China holds the upper hand in the relationship with Russia, with its sway growing as Moscow’s international isolation deepens following its invasion of Ukraine.
That asymmetry is still  “changing in China’s favour” as it enables Moscow  “to continue the war by providing very necessary materials for the Russian war machine”, Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre, said.
“Integrating Russia’s economy, brainpower, and military technology into...
a Chinese-led order with Eurasia at its geographic heart, is the only way Russia can sustain its confrontation with the West,” he wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this week.
“China has stronger bargaining power and many more options than does Russia, and its leverage over its northern neighbour is growing all the time,” he added.
“Russia is now locking itself into vassalage to China.” 
US officials have recently warned Beijing against providing indirect aid to the Russian war effort and regularly urge China to wield its influence to help bring about peace in Ukraine.
In Brussels last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that  “China continues to provide materials to support Russia’s defence industrial base”.
And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who wrapped up a visit to China on Monday, said she had warned officials of the consequences of supporting Russia’s military procurement.

1,Shipwreck off Djibouti leaves  38 migrants dead,"ADDIS ABABA: The bodies of 38 migrants, including children, have been recovered after a shipwreck off the Horn of...","ADDIS ABABA: The bodies of 38 migrants, including children, have been recovered after a shipwreck off the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti, the UN said on Tuesday, the latest disaster on the so-called Eastern migration route.
The UN’s International Organisation for Migration said that the boat was carrying 66 people when it sank in the early hours of Monday. The tragedy took place just 200 metres (yards) off the coast of Godoria in the northeast of Djibouti, the agency said.
“Thirty-eight bodies have been recovered. 22 survivors are being assisted by IOM and local authorities,” IOM regional spokesperson Yvonne Ngede said.
She said those on the boat included women, children and babies and that most of them were believed to be Ethiopian nationals.
In a post on X accompanied by a picture of white body bags lined up on a beach, the IOM said at least six other people were missing and presumed dead after the  “tragic shipwreck”.
The Ethiopian embassy in Djibouti said the accident involved a boat carrying around 60 Ethiopian migrants from Djibouti to war-torn Yemen.
Each year, many tens of thousands of African migrants brave the perilous  “Eastern Route” across the Red Sea and through war-scarred Yemen to reach Saudi Arabia, escaping conflict, or natural disaster or seeking better economic opportunities.
“On their journeys, many face life-threatening dangers including starvation, health risks and exploitation — at the hands of human traffickers and other criminals,” the IOM said in a statement in February.
Africa’s second most populous country, Ethiopia is blighted by various conflicts and several regions have suffered from severe drought in recent years. More than 15 percent of its some 120 million inhabitants depend on food aid.
The Ethiopian embassy in Djibouti said that in the last five years, 189 of its citizens making the journey had lost their lives in boat accidents alone.

2,Five policemen shot dead in Iran’s southeast,"According to Iranian news agency Tasnim, two police vehicles came under fire along a road in Sistan-Baluchistan.","TEHRAN: At least five Iranian police officers were killed on Tuesday in an attack in the restive Sistan-Baluchistan province in the country’s southeast, state TV reported.
Local media reported that Jaish al-Adl had claimed responsibility for the shooting, but a local official said criminal gangs were to blame.
“A number of armed miscreants in the region attacked a police patrol,” Alireza Marhamati, deputy governor of Sistan-Baluchistan province told state TV.
“Five of our dear policemen were martyred and one person was injured there,” he said.
Marhamati added that security forces were looking for the attackers, insisting they were not Jaish al-Adl members.
“It is not their job,” he said, arguing the jihadists had claimed the attack  “to make themselves bigger”.
According to Iranian news agency Tasnim, two police vehicles came under fire along a road in Sistan-Baluchistan, long plagued by unrest involving drug-smuggling gangs, rebels from the Baluch and Sunni extremists.
Last week militants from Jaish al-Adl — branded a  “terrorist” organisation by Iran and the United States — killed 16 security personnel in one of their deadliest attacks in years, also in Sistan-Baluchistan.
The fatalities included law enforcement officials, members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and paramilitary Basij forces, according to a Tasnim report which said US weapons and technology were seized from the  “terrorists”.State media said that Iranian police had arrested three suspected members of the militant Islamic State group over plans to carry out attacks at the end of Ramazan.
Official news agency IRNA reported that the arrests had been made in the northwestern city of Karaj but did not specify when or elaborate on the suspects’ identities.

3,"Hepatitis viruses kill 3,500 people a day","GENEVA: More than 3,500 people die from hepatitis viruses every day and the global toll is rising, the World Health...","GENEVA: More than 3,500 people die from hepatitis viruses every day and the global toll is rising, the World Health Organisation warned on Tuesday, calling for swift action to fight the second-largest infectious killer.
New data from 187 countries showed that the number of deaths from viral hepatitis rose to 1.3 million in 2022 from 1.1 million in 2019, according to a WHO report released to coincide with the World Hepatitis Summit in Portugal this week.
These are  “alarming trends,” Meg Doherty, head of the WHO’s global HIV, hepatitis and sexually-transmitted infection programmes, told a press conference.
The report said that there are 3,500 deaths per day worldwide from hepatitis infections — 83 per cent from hepatitis B, 17 percent from hepatitis C. There are effective and cheap generic drugs which can treat these viruses.
Yet only three per cent of those with chronic hep B received antiviral treatment by the end of 2022, the report said. For hep C, just 20pc — or 12.5 million people — had been treated.
“These results fall well below the global targets to treat 80pc of all people living with chronic hep B and C by 2030,” Doherty said. The overall rate of hepatitis infections did fall slightly.

4,Kazakhstan and Russia battle huge floods,ASTANA: Water levels in overflowing rivers were still rising on Tuesday in swathes of Russia and Kazakhstan that ...,"ASTANA: Water levels in overflowing rivers were still rising on Tuesday in swathes of Russia and Kazakhstan that have been hit by massive floods, with Russia’s city of Orenburg and western Siberia bracing for a new peak.
Both Astana and Moscow have called the floods the worst in decades, introducing a state of emergency as water covered entire cities and villages. More than 100,000 people have been evacuated from the rising water — mostly in Kazakhstan.
The Kremlin said the situation remains  “difficult” in large parts of Russia but insisted that President Vladimir Putin has — so far — no plans to visit the zone. The neighbours have pledged to cooperate on battling the floods.
“Since the beginning of the floods, more than 86,000 people have been rescued and evacuated,” the Kazakh government said on Tuesday.
It said that 8,472 of the evacuees were in temporary housing, with the rest believed to be in safe places in the community. Kazakhstan also said it had taken 81,000 animals to safety.

5,Top Europe court chides Switzerland in landmark climate ruling,Swiss government says it would examine measures it should take following the ruling.,"STRASBOURG: Europe’s top rights court on Tuesday said Switzerland was not doing enough to tackle climate change in a historic decision that could force governments to adopt more ambitious climate policies.
The European Court of Human Rights, part of the 46-member Council of Europe, however, threw out two other climate cases against European states on procedural grounds.
Hopes had been high for a legal turning point ahead of the rulings in the three cases, treated as a priority by the 17 judges of the court’s Grand Chamber.
In the first case, the court found that the Swiss state had violated Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the  “right to respect for private and family life”, according to the ruling.
The Swiss association of Elders for Climate Protection — 2,500 women aged 73 on average — had complained about the  “failings of the Swiss authorities” in terms of climate protection that could  “seriously harm” their health.
The court found  “there were some critical lacunae” in relevant Swiss regulations, including a failure to quantify limits on national greenhouse gas emissions. The court ordered the Swiss state to pay the association 80,000 euros (almost $87,000) within three months. The lawyer of the Swiss association, Cordelia Bahr, said the court had  “established that climate protection was a human right”.
“It’s a huge victory for us and a legal precedent for all the states of the Council of Europe,” she said. Climate activist Greta Thunberg said it was  “only the beginning of climate litigation”.
“All over the world more and more people are taking their government to court, holding them responsible for their actions,” she said inside the court after attending the rulings.
‘Historic’
Joie Chowdhury, a lawyer from the Centre for International Environmental Law, said the ruling was  “historic”. “We expect this ruling to influence climate action and climate litigation across Europe and far beyond,” she said.
It “leaves no doubt: the climate crisis is a human rights crisis, and states have human rights obligations to act urgently and effectively… to prevent further devastation and harm to people and the environment,” she said.
Gerry Liston, of the NGO Global Legal Action Network, said before the rulings that a victory in any of the three cases could constitute  “the most significant legal development on climate change for Europe since the signing of the Paris 2015 Agreement”.
The Paris Agreement set targets for governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The Swiss government said it would examine measures it should take following the ruling. Alain Chablais, the lawyer who represented Switzerland in court, warned it might take  “some time”.
The hard-right Swiss People’s Party, the country’s largest political party but which has only two of seven seats in the government, called the decision a  “scandal” and an  “interference” in domestic policy, and called for Switzerland to withdraw from the Council of Europe.

6,Simon Harris becomes Ireland’s youngest prime minister,"DUBLIN: Simon Harris on Tuesday became Ireland’s new prime minister, replacing Leo Varadkar after he abruptly quit...","DUBLIN: Simon Harris on Tuesday became Ireland’s new prime minister, replacing Leo Varadkar after he abruptly quit last month citing personal and political reasons.
Ireland’s parliament voted 88 to 69 in favour of Harris, 37, becoming  “taoiseach” — a Gaelic word for  “chieftain” or  “leader” pronounced  “tee-shock”. He was officially installed later at a ceremony with President Michael D. Higgins, becoming the country’s youngest ever prime minister.
The centre-right Fine Gael party — part of a three-party governing coalition — selected Harris as its leader following an uncontested election after Varadkar announced his resignation.
On accepting the nomination on Tuesday, Harris told parliament:  “I commit to doing everything that I can to honour the trust that you have placed in me today. “This is very much a partnership government and I intend to lead us in the spirit of unity, collaboration and mutual respect,” he said, watched on by his wife and two children.
“I want to bring new ideas and new energy and, I hope, a new empathy to public life. Time is certainly short, and there’s a lot to do,” Harris added. Vara­dkar, who was in his second stint as prime minister and at 45 was one of Europe’s youngest leaders, said last month that he felt he was no longer the  “best person” to lead the country. The outgoing leader, who himself was the youngest taoiseach when first elected in 2017, on Tuesday said that he  “always knew” Harris would fill the top job.

7,Hamas says Israeli proposal fails  to meet Palestinian demands,Will review the proposal further and go back to the mediators with its response.,"CAIRO: Hamas said on Tuesday that an Israeli proposal on a ceasefire did not meet the demands of Palestinian factions, but it would study the offer further and deliver its response to mediators.
The proposal was handed to the Palestinian movement by Egyptian and Qatari mediators at talks in Cairo that aim to find a way out of the crisis in the Gaza Strip, now in its seventh month.
Residents said Israeli forces kept up airstrikes on Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza and Rafah on the enclave’s southern edge on Tuesday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly flagged plans for a ground assault on Rafah, where more than one million displaced civilians are holed up, despite international pleas for restraint.
The talks in Cairo, also attended by the director of the US Central Intelligence Agency William Burns, have so far failed to reach a breakthrough towards pausing the Israeli aggression.
“The movement (Hamas) is interested in reaching an agreement that puts an end to the aggression on our people. Despite that, the Israeli position remains intransigent and it didn’t meet any of the demands of our people and our resistance,” Hamas said in a statement following the latest ceasefire proposal.
It said it would review the proposal further and go back to the mediators with its response.
Hamas wants any agreement to secure an end to the Israeli military offensive, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and to allow displaced people to return to their homes across the small, densely populated enclave.
Israel wants to secure the release of prisoners seized by Hamas in the Oct 7 cross-border raid. The United States is pushing hard for a ceasefire, after telling its ally Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza and let in more aid to prevent a famine.
In Washington, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said 400 aid trucks had been cleared to enter Gaza the previous day, describing it as the most since the crisis started six months ago. He said a good ceasefire offer had been presented to Hamas, which should accept it.
Israel pulled back most of its ground forces from southern Gaza this week after months of fighting, but still says it plans to launch an assault on Rafah, on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, where more than half of Gazans are now sheltering.
In one of the first signs of concrete preparations for a ground assault, Israeli media reported on Tuesday that the Israeli defence ministry was purchasing 40,000 tents ahead of an evacuation of the city.
Netanyahu said Israel’s aims were to release the prisoners and to secure total victory over Hamas. Of the 253 people Hamas seized on Oct 7, 133 prisoners remain captive.Negotiators have spoken of around 40 going free in the first stage of a deal.
Palestinian emergency teams supported by international organisations scoured the rubble of Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City and the shattered city of Khan Younis in the south following the withdrawal of Israeli troops.
So far the teams have recovered 409 bodies of Palestinians killed in the hospital and its surrounding neighbourhood and in Khan Younis, according to Mahmoud Basal, spokesperson for the Hamas-run Gaza Civil Emer­gency Service.

8,Physicist who discovered Higgs boson dies,"LONDON: British physicist Peter Higgs, whose theory of a mass-giving particle — the so-called Higgs boson —...","LONDON: British physicist Peter Higgs, whose theory of a mass-giving particle — the so-called Higgs boson — jointly earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics, has died aged 94, the University of Edinburgh announced on Tuesday.
“He passed away peacefully at home on Monday April 8 following a short illness,” the Scottish university, where he had been a professor for nearly five decades, said in a statement.
It called him  “a great teacher and mentor, inspiring generations of young scientists”.
“His family has asked that the media and public respect their privacy at this time,” the university added.
Higgs used ground-breaking theoretical work to help explain how the Universe has mass, thus resolving one of the greatest puzzles in physics and earning him a place alongside Albert Einstein and Max Planck in textbooks.
His 1964 theory of a mass-giving particle, which became known as the Higgs boson, won him and Belgian physicist Francois Englert the 2013 physics Nobel Prize. That followed experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) finally confirming the theory the previous year, nearly half a century on.
“Peter Higgs was a remarkable individual — a truly gifted scientist whose vision and imagination have enriched our knowledge of the world that surrounds us,” Peter Mathieson, Vice Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh, said.
“His pioneering work has motivated thousands of scientists, and his legacy will continue to inspire many more for generations to come.”

9,Australia hints it could recognise Palestinian state,"SYDNEY: Australia on Tuesday became the latest country to advocate formal recognition of a Palestinian state, ...","SYDNEY: Australia on Tuesday became the latest country to advocate formal recognition of a Palestinian state, further shattering a long-standing diplomatic taboo in the West.
Foreign Minister Penny Wong said that recognising a state of Palestine could restart the moribund Middle East peace process and undermine extremist forces in the Middle East.
“Recognising a Palestinian state — one that can only exist side by side with a secure Israel — doesn’t just offer the Palestinian people an opportunity to realise their aspirations”, she told an audience in Canberra.
“It also strengthens the forces for peace, and undermines extremism. It undermines Hamas, Iran and Iran’s other destructive proxies in the region.” For decades, the formal recognition of a Palestinian state has been seen as the endgame of a peace process between Palestinians and their Israeli neighbours.
The United States, Australia and most Western European nations have said they are willing to one day recognise Palestinian statehood, but not before agreement on thorny issues like the status of Jerusalem and final borders are agreed.“The failures of this approach by all parties over decades — as well as the Netanyahu Government’s refusal to even engage on the question of a Palestinian state — have caused widespread frustration,” Wong said.
“So the international community is now considering the question of Palestinian statehood as a way of building momentum towards a two-state solution,” she added.
Her comments come after the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, Slovenia and Spain have floated the idea of recognising a Palestinian state.
In 2014, Sweden, which has a large Palestinian community, became the first EU member in western Europe to recognise a Palestinian state.
Sanchez to lobby for Palestinian state
Spanish  Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will meet several of his European Union  counterparts over the next week to try to garner support for the  recognition of a Palestinian state, the government said on Tuesday.
Sanchez’s  agenda includes meetings with the prime ministers of Norway, Ireland,  Portugal, Slovenia and 
Belgium focusing on the EU’s position regarding  the  Gaza Strip, government spokesperson Pilar  Alegria told reporters.
