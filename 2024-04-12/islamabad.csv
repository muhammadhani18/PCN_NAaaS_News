0,Malala looks forward to working with government to uplift education sector,"Nobel Laureate concerned over 26m out-of-school kids, shortage of teachers.","ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai after showing concerns over 26 million out-of-school children and a large number of vacant seats for teachers in Pakistan has offered a helping hand and asked the prime minister to focus on the education sector to promote education.
Malala Yousafzai in a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said: “Currently, 26 million children — predominantly girls in the poorest districts of Pakistan — remain out of school. Furthermore, more than 200,000 teachers’ seats are vacant nationwide.”
“This gap is severely affecting the functioning of schools and negatively impacting student retention and quality of schooling. Our collective aim should be to design a measurable, realistic plan to bring these numbers down significantly over the course of your term,” she added.
Malala further said that her organisation supported civil society and education experts in their efforts to improve teaching practices, digital education, and girls’ leadership development, but still, critical work remained.

Nobel Laureate concerned over 26m out-of-school kids, shortage of teachers

In her letter to the PM, she said: “Congratulations on your appointment as the Prime Minister of Pakistan. I wish you all the best as you begin your term in the office. In the busy months ahead, you will undoubtedly have many critical issues to contend with and agendas to advance. I would humbly ask that you see the education of girls in Pakistan as one of your most urgent and meaningful priorities.”
She said that Pakistan has made significant progress in girls’ education in the last decade, “and I am proud that Malala Fund has continued to play its part. As you may know, Malala Fund has invested more than $15 million in Pakistan. Our work with the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training has allowed us to reach more than 4,500 high schools, engaging directly with nearly 500,000 girls through our STEAM partnership.”
She said: “I know that ensuring more girls are able to access and complete school in Pakistan will not come without cost, and budgetary constraints facing the state are understandable. At Malala Fund, we are beginning advocacy work this year to promote the reform of the international financing architecture.”
“This would include efforts that focus on relieving the increasing debt burden faced by many countries. My hope is that these global efforts — including work with stakeholders such as the UN, the World Bank, the IMF, and their donors — can complement and support important work happening within Pakistan to increase the domestic budget for education,” she said and added that right now, Pakistan spends less than 2 per cent of its GDP on education. In the years ahead, “I hope to see this figure reach and surpass 4%, aligned with the targets outlined in your party manifesto for the 2024 general election,” she told PM through letter.
“As you [PM] develop your first 100-day plan, I look forward to working with your government to elevate girls’ education as a priority. I assure you that my team in Pakistan and our grantees are working diligently with your federal and provincial governments, as well as other development partners, to advance our shared goals as rapidly and effectively as possible.”
“I thank you for your attention and look forward to staying in touch, whether on the margins of the UN General Assembly week meetings in September or later this year when I hope to travel to Pakistan again,” she said.

1,"Hearing on appeals against conviction of Imran, Bushra in Iddat case adjourned",Sessions judge warns court will issue an appropriate order on next hearing if counsel for complainant did not appear.,"ISLAMABAD: The district and sessions judge (DSJ) on Tuesday adjourned hearing on the appeals against the conviction of former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi in a case related to contracting Nikkah during the latter’s Iddat period.
The counsel for the complainant Khawar Fareed Manika remained absent.
Judge Shahrukh Arjumand resumed hearing on the appeals.
Barrister Chaudhry Usama Jameel, an associate of lead counsel of the complainant, informed the judge that the senior lawyer, Raja Rizwan Abbasi, could not appear before the court and sought adjournment.
Bushra Bibi’s counsel Usman Riaz Gill opposed the request saying that the trial court judges in the cases of Toshakhana, cipher and Iddat cases never accepted any request of adjournment, adding that the court-appointed state counsel for cross-examination for late arrival of the counsels of Mr Khan and Shah Mehmood Qureshi.
Barrister Salman Akram Raja, counsel for Mr Khan, argued that the former prime minister did not sign the chargesheet and the legal formalities were not fulfilled during the trial proceeding.
Mr Raja said the defence counsel as well as the accused persons repeatedly requested the court to grant reasonable time for preparation of arguments, but the trial judge completed the proceeding in haste.
On the other hand, Mr Gill said Bushra Bibi sought adjournment for medical reason and attached the doctor’s report, but to no avail.
He said the accused were never given the right of fair trial nor were they allowed to produce evidence in their defence.
The counsel further argued that a proxy application was filed before the same court, however, it had been withdrawn a day before Khawar Manika filed the application.
The prosecutor, Hassan Abbas, also argued before the court.
District and Sessions Judge Shahrukh Arjumand adjourned further hearing till April 15, and warned that the court would issue an appropriate order on the next date even if the counsel for the complainant did not appear.

2,Suspect shot dead in police ‘encounter’ in Kirpa,"ISLAMABAD: A suspect was killed in Kirpa in an alleged encounter with the police in the small hours of Tuesday, Dawn...","ISLAMABAD: A suspect was killed in Kirpa in an alleged encounter with the police in the small hours of Tuesday, Dawn has learnt. After the incident, the capital police claimed that the suspect was killed by the firing of his accomplices.
According to police officers, the incident took place after Sehri in Kirpa, but the case over the alleged encounter was not registered even after the passage of more than 10 hours. They further said the suspect was picked up by the police and detained at a private cell located in a rural area before the alleged encounter.
On Monday, the PRO through a message invited media persons to attend an important press conference of DIG Operations Syed Shahzad Nadeem Bukhari, but it was cancelled at the eleventh hour, the officers said, adding that the press conference was slated to announce the arrest of an alleged criminal wanted in a number of cases, but it was cancelled due to unknown reason.
The police spokesperson told Dawn the encounter occurred after Sehri and a case in this regard had not been registered. He expressed ignorance about the delay in the registration of the FIR. Replying to a question that the police picked up the suspect before the encounter, the PRO responded that the deceased was not arrested by the police.
When asked about the details of the encounter, the PRO showed ignorance and said the FIR over the incident had not been registered.
According to a tweet by the Islamabad police, the capital police raided an area in the remits of the Kirpa police station in response to information about the presence of proclaimed offenders.
The criminals started firing at the police after seeing them, however, the official remained unhurt due to protective measures, the statement said, adding that as a result of the firing by the criminals, one of their accomplices was shot dead.
The deceased was identified as Ahmed Shah. The suspect was wanted in over 12 cases, including a murder and robbery, it added.
During the ongoing year, eight encounters occurred in the capital between the suspects and the police.
In these encounters, two suspects were killed and five were injured. Last year, in at least 63 encounters, 12 suspects were eliminated and 27 were incapacitated. In the same year, a policeman from the Punjab police was also killed and 10 officials of the capital police were injured in such incidents.

3,Number of rescued black bears at Islamabad rehab centre reaches 10,The transfer was arranged by the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board in collaboration with the Four Paws team.,"ISLAMABAD: As many as 10 black bears are now housed in the Rescue and Rehab Centre, formerly known as Islamabad zoo, after two more were rescued and transferred from Khushab.
The transfer, which took place early Tuesday morning, was arranged by the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) in collaboration with the Four Paws team.
The operation commenced at 5am on Tuesday, with the IWMB staff and Four Paws team members working tirelessly to ensure the safe reception of the newly-rescued bears. Upon arrival, it was evident that both bears — Boogie and Laila — were in dire condition, with their faces bearing numerous scratches — a grim reminder of the harsh realities they endured, likely from engaging in bear baiting.
Dr Frank Goritz, who is head veterinarian at Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research Berlin, had to operate and surgically remove one of Boogie’s infected eyes.
Both, eight years old Boogie and six to seven years old Laila had no teeth.
“Both bears got the best treatment in the world. The Four Paws team has been working tirelessly from 8am till sundown since they arrived a few days ago to give the bears complete head to toe checkup,” said Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) Chairperson Rina Saeed Khan.
Four Paws returned on a five-day visit on the urgent request of the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB). A team of Four Paws veterinarians and wildlife experts have supported the Pakistani wildlife authorities with the veterinary treatment and neutering of eight resident bears at the Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre.
The team also assisted in planned rescue and relocation of the new confiscated bears from bear baiting, dancing and breeding activities.
The two bears were transferred following a visit by Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb to the Rescue and Rehab Centre on Monday.
“We requested her to transfer Boogie and Laila to the rescue centre where some of the best veterinarians will administer treatment they need.
“She agreed immediately, for which we are grateful,” said Rina Saeed Khan.
According to Ms Khan, the Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre was poised to evolve into a sanctuary in the near future.
“With ample space spanning 28 acres, the centre is well-equipped to establish permanent residences for the rescued bears,” she said, adding that “furthermore, there has been keen interest from international donors to provide financial support to IWMB for this initiative”.
The addition of these two bears to the centre underscores the ongoing efforts to provide sanctuary and care for animals rescued from such cruel practices. With proper rehabilitation and compassionate care, it was hoped that these bears would be able to heal and thrive in their newfound home, said Rina Khan optimistically.
Since the Asiatic black bear is indigenous to Pakistan, the rescued bears will not be sent abroad like Kaavan the elephant and Baboo, the rescued Bengal tiger.
As half of the Four Paws team returns home Tuesday night, the remaining members would be staying behind to ensure the bears get post surgery care if required.
“Their team is also leaving behind medication for the bears that cannot be acquired locally. They will be returning in a few weeks to assist the Punjab government to end the cruel practice of bear baiting and street dancing. Punjab is the only province where these cruel practices prevail,” Rina Khan added.

People gather on a platform to board a train for their hometown at Rawalpindi Railway Station on Tuesday. — White Star

 
RAWALPINDI: The Rawalpindi railway station and bus terminals in different parts of the city, especially at Pirwadhai, were thronged with passengers going to their hometowns to celebrate Eidul Fitr. The rushswelled on Tuesday with passengers complaining of being overcharged by transporters.
Pakistan Railways launched special trains for Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar besides attaching additional coaches to the trains. The last special train to Karachi left on Tuesday while a train from Quetta brought passengers, said railway officials. They said every year there was a rushof people at the railway station and the management made elaborate measures to deal with it.
The passengers at the railway station complained that they faced hardship in getting tickets. They wanted to reserve seats but due to rushat booking stations they failed to do so.
However, some passengers complained about black marketing of tickets. “Some people were in the railway station selling tickets at high rates,” alleged Mohammad Akhter, who was going to Lahore.
Meanwhile, the inter-province and inter-district busterminals too witnessed a big rush of passengers. Hundreds of passengers boarded buses and wagons for Lahore, Peshawar, Bhakhar and Multan from Soan, Pirwadhai Mor and Pirwadhai general busstands.
The passengers complained of overcharging by transporters and overcrowded buses and wagons. They told Dawn that transporters were charging more than normal fares. “I have to pay double the normal fare for Multan,” said Mohammad Tanveer. He said he had no option but to pay the double fare.
On the other hand, Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema said that the administration will not allow overcharging by transporters. He directed Regional Transport Authority Secretary Rashid Ali to visit the bus stand at Pirwadhai and take strict action against transporters charging high fares. He said implementation of fares was being ensured, he said.

In a letter addressed to the chief minister, Dr Vankwani said the bill was a move to develop coordination between the federal government and the provinces to promote and market Gandhara heritage as part of Pakistani culture, which would help increase revenue through the systematic arrival of international pilgrims.
The letter was in response to criticism by certain quarters, including the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, over the recent ‘Gandhara Corridor’ introduced by Dr Vankwani in the National Assembly.
Dr Vankwani said there was no conspiracy to snatch or take administrative control of the Gandhara civilisation from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He said the bill was an attempt at exploring opportunities for strengthening Pakistan’s economy as well as projecting a positive image of the country, as establishing a high-level facilitation centre at the federal level to promote Gandhara faith pilgrimage with the collaboration of provinces would not violate the 18th Amendment, which ensured provincial autonomy.
The letter by Dr Vankwani further added that Gandhara should not only be limited to the remains or archaeological sites, as Gandhara civilisation was actually based on tolerance, harmony and brotherhood among different faiths, communities and segments of human society.
“The Gandhara civilisation comprises several historical archaeological sites spread across Pakistan and has the potential to attract the followers of Dharmic religions of the subcontinent, including Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism,” it added.
Dr Vankwani had been spearheading the campaign to promote Gandhara tourism, and while serving as chairman of the Prime Minister’s Taskforce on Gandhara Tourism, he identified 50 potential Gandhara sites in all provinces, which already included Mohenjodaro remains and stupas located in Sindh as well.
Out of 50 sites, 38 are related to Buddhism, 10 to Hinduism and two belong to Jainism. He said the proposed Gandhara Corridor would also demonstrate that the state of Pakistan supported non-Muslims to enjoy religious freedom, as guaranteed in the Constitution and international laws.
“I would like to request you to kindly arrange my meeting with all the stakeholders of KP under your leadership at the CM House, Peshawar, on a priority basis to address the reservations that have arisen regarding the Gandhara Bill,” the letter added.
