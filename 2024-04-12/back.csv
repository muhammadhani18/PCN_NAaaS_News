0,"Russia, Germany, UK urge restraint as Iranian threat puts Middle East on edge","German airline Lufthansa extends Tehran flight suspension, Russia issues Middle East travel warning","Amidst escalating tensions, Russia, Germany, and Britain urged restraint among Middle Eastern nations, while Israel affirmed it was preparing to 'meet all its security needs' in response to the Iran's threat to strike Israel on Thursday.
The German airline Lufthansa, one of only two Western carriers flying to Tehran, extended a suspension of its flights to the Iranian capital and Russia warned against travel to the Middle East.
Iran has vowed revenge for the April 1 airstrike on its embassy compound in Damascus that killed a top Iranian general and six other Iranian military officers, ratcheting up tension in a region already strained by Israel's invasion of Gaza.
Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack, but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday Israel ""must be punished and it shall be"", saying it was tantamount to an attack on Iranian soil.
The ""imperative for Iran to punish this rogue regime"" might have been avoided had the UN Security Council condemned the strike and brought the perpetrators to justice, Tehran's mission to the United Nations said on Thursday.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was keeping up its war on Gaza but making security preparations elsewhere.
""Whoever harms us, we will harm them. We are prepared to meet all of the security needs of the State of Israel, both defensively and offensively,"" he said in comments released following a visit to an air force base.
Iran has signalled to Washington that it will respond to Israel's attack in a way that aims to avoid major escalation and it will not act hastily, Iranian sources said.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin that Israel would respond directly to any attack by Iran, Gallant's office said.
The conflict has spread across the Middle East since the eruption of Israel's war on Gaza, with Iran-backed groups declaring support for the Palestinians waging attacks from Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq.

Tehran has avoided confrontation with Israel or the United States while declaring support for its allies.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called on her Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian to urge 'maximum restraint' to avoid further escalation.
Russia's foreign ministry told citizens they should not travel to the Middle East, especially to Israel, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories.
""Right now it's very important for everyone to maintain restraint so as not to lead to a complete destabilisation of the situation in the region, which doesn't exactly shine with stability and predictability,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a news briefing.
Potential for miscalculation
British foreign minister David Cameron said on Thursday he had made clear to Amirabdollahian that Iran should not draw the Middle East into a wider conflict.
""I am deeply concerned about the potential for miscalculation leading to further violence,"" Cameron said on X (formerly Twitter).
US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Secretary of State Antony Blinken called counterparts including the Turkish, Chinese and Saudi foreign ministers ""to make clear that escalation is not in anyone's interest and that countries should urge Iran not to escalate.""
US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday Iran was threatening to launch a ""significant attack in Israel"", and that he had told Netanyahu that ""our commitment to Israel security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is iron-clad"".
The US expects an attack by Iran against Israel but one that would not be big enough to draw Washington into war, a US official said late on Thursday.
The US military said on Thursday it had destroyed an anti-ship ballistic missile launched from an area of Yemen controlled by Iran-backed Houthi militia. No injuries or damage were reported to US, coalition or merchant vessels.
Iran is the third-largest oil producer in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (OPEC) group and oil prices stayed near six-month highs on Thursday.
Late on Wednesday, an Iranian news agency published an Arabic report on the X platform saying the air space over Tehran had been closed for military drills, but then removed the report and denied it had issued such news.
Lufthansa said it would probably not fly to Tehran before April 13. Austrian Airlines said it was still planning to fly on Thursday but was adjusting timings to avoid crew having to disembark for an overnight layover.
Iranian air space is also a key overflight route for Emirates' and Qatar Airways' flights to Europe and North America.
Emirates, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Aeroflot and Air Arabia, among the airlines that fly to Tehran, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1,UK adds seven new countries to travel advisory 'black list',No change in Pakistan’s travel advisory status which was last updated on January 24,"The United Kingdom has added seven new countries to a list of destinations declared extremely dangerous for travel, according to an advisory issued by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).
The new additions to the list are Russia, Ukraine, Iran, Sudan, Lebanon, Israel, Belarus, and the Palestinian territories.
The total number of 'banned' countries and regions now stands at 24. The FCDO said in a statement that these countries were included in the list based on crime, war, terrorism, disease, extreme weather, natural disasters and potential threats to tourists.

“British nationals are advised to only travel to these countries if absolutely necessary, to take all necessary precautions and to give advance notice before departure,” it added.
However, there was no change in Pakistan’s travel advisory status which was last updated on January 24.
The FCDO advises against travel to certain destinations in the country, which include the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area, some districts of Khyber-Paktunkhwa, Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and ""all areas of Sindh Province north of and including the city of Nawabshah"".
A similar advisory, advising against travel to certain areas, exists for India, Bangladesh, Egypt, Malaysia, Indonesia and other countries.

2,China launch of relay satellite Queqiao-2 for lunar probe mission successful,"Developer Xiong Liang described satellite as ""the main switch"" of whole fourth phase of lunar missions","China National Space Administration (CNSA) said on Friday its launch of a key signal relay satellite was a ""complete success"" and it would serve as the communication bridge for its future lunar probe missions for years to come, state media reported.
China launched the satellite Queqiao-2, which was named after a mythological bridge made of magpies, and two miniature satellites, Tiandu-1 and Tiandu-2, on March 20.
Queqiao-2 will be used as a communications bridge between the ground operations on Earth and upcoming lunar probe missions on the far side of the moon until at least 2030.
The moon's near side always faces Earth. That means data transfers from the far side are impossible because there is no direct line of sight.
Queqiao-2 researcher and developer Xiong Liang described the satellite as ""the main switch"" of the whole fourth phase of lunar missions, according to state television CCTV.
""Only when the main switch is flipped on, all the communications can kick-off,"" Xiong said.
Queqiao-2 will orbit the moon and relay signals to and from the Chang'e-6 mission, which is expected to be launched in May. The robotic Chang'e-6 probe will seek to retrieve samples from an ancient basin, acquiring lunar material from the moon's hidden side for the first time.
Queqiao-2 will also be used as a relay platform for the Chang'e-7 lunar mission in 2026 and the Chang'e-8 mission in 2028.
The functions and performance of Queqiao-2 met mission requirements and it will be able to provide relay communication services for China's lunar exploration projects and future lunar missions for China and other countries, said the CNSA, according to CCTV.
Queqiao-2 entered its targeted elliptical orbit on April 2 after a correction midway, near-moon braking and orbital manoeuvre around the moon, CNSA said.
The satellite has successfully communicated with Chang'e 4, which was the first spacecraft to perform a soft landing on the far side of the moon and is still carrying out its exploration mission. It also communicated with the Chang'e-6 probe while it was still on the ground earlier this month.
The successful launch of Queqiao-2 comes after the failed launch of another lunar spacecraft DRO-A/B satellites, which was intended to enter the moon's distant retrograde orbit (DRO).
China has not released any information on whether or not the satellites can be retrieved.

3,At least 25 perish in Punjab road mishaps over two Eid days,"Around 4,500 road accidents across Punjab reported, says Rescue 1122","At least 25 people lost their lives and over 2,500 injuries were reported in road mishaps across Punjab over two days of Eidul Fitr.

4,Senate to get more powers,Senate informs IPU it will have a say in ministerial appointments,"The Senate has conveyed to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the global body representing national parliaments, that Pakistan's legislative assembly will exercise authority in the appointment of ministers and cabinet members in the forthcoming periods, it emerged on Friday.
According to a report submitted to the IPU, the upper house of parliament has underscored its commitment to bolstering the Senate’s role in matters concerning the Money Bill (budget).
Furthermore, it has assured the IPU of efforts to align Pakistan's domestic legal framework with international human rights standards.
In addition, the Senate has apprised the global forum that it will introduce a constitutional or legal provision related to conflicts of interest, which would require lawmakers to declare sponsored travel and accommodation.
Moreover, it vowed to regulate the practice of lobbying by individuals or groups, each with varying and specific interests, which attempt to influence decisions taken at the legislative level. The details emerged after the Senate identified at least 14 opportunities to strengthen parliament and submitted the report to the IPU.
Currently, the National Assembly’s website states that members of the cabinet are appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister, saying in the formation of the cabinet the major portion (75%), goes to the National Assembly while the rest (25%) are taken from the Senate.
It further added that the National Assembly has an edge over the Senate by legislating exclusively on money matters. With exception to money bills, however, both houses work together to carry out the basic work of the Parliament, i.e. law-making.
The other goals include: establishing a parliamentary budget office; establishing a bureau as the collective governing body of parliament, with representation from both houses; establishing legal provisions relating to equal physical and online access to the parliamentary building, its processes and proceedings, for all citizens, regardless of disability or other special needs.

Furthermore, the Senate aims at developing an impact assessment manual, guide or similar document that establishes procedures and criteria for assessing the impacts that a proposal for a law, a programme or a policy might have on different groups, and potentially entrusting such assessments to a dedicated body.
It also eyes on devising policies and/or plans on gender mainstreaming and considering the gender lens when formulating parliamentary policies; holding workshops or dialogue sessions for senators and secretariat staff on bringing gender-responsive budgeting into the mainstream; and periodically assessing gender balance in the secretariat to ensure the effectiveness of related policies, particularly at senior levels
Moreover, the targets included amending the Senate’s rules of procedure to enable senators and secretariat staff to care for young children during the conduct of legislative business and introducing online voting and video-conferencing facilities to help senators and staff with caring responsibilities to exercise their duties. Lastly, it wishes to introduce childcare facilities for Senators and Secretariat staff.
In response, the IPU has acknowledged that Pakistan’s Senate self-tested the democratic credentials of the upper house of the parliament, saying it generated 14 recommendations for itself to become more effective.
The global body said that development of the self-assessment toolkit began in 2019, with the IPU partnering with a host of parliamentary organisations and other important stakeholders. It said that participating in a focus group to discuss an early version, a staff member of the Parliament of Pakistan saw the potential for his country and proposed a self-assessment. The idea rapidly gained political support in the Senate, it noted.

The self-assessment is based on 25 Indicators, each one with several criteria. The indicators are grouped into seven targets, matching the language used in targets 16.6 and 16.7 of the UN’s sustainable development goals.
Target 16.6 asks to develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels while target 16.7 says to ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.
The Senate put together a steering committee of three senators, who worked closely with the Senate’s Secretary General and with support from the Senate secretariat, including its parliamentary digital development unit (PDU).
With limited time and competing priorities, the IPU noted, setting aside time to complete the work was a struggle for senators and parliamentary staff. Meanwhile, it said, the requirement to find evidence for almost 500 criteria made the task even more complex and challenging.
But three months after the initial decision to self-test, the process was complete. Comments and feedback had been incorporated into a single document – including the evidence, grades and recommendations for change – and submitted to the Senate chairman for approval.
Some Senators said that the true significance of the assessment had revealed itself throughout the process, which included a thorough review of administrative capacities, accessibility standards and the working environment, as well as of the openness, inclusivity and transparency of parliamentary operations.
The Parliament discovered that it was able to call upon its own parliamentary staff and take ownership of the assessment, making it a more strategic document that responded to its needs.
The statement said that democracy is not an easy concept to measure, but when the IPU and partners produced the Indicators for Democratic Parliaments, several parliaments tested out this self-assessment toolkit, including Pakistan’s upper house, the Senate.
“Since independence in 1947,” it noted, “Pakistan’s democratic credentials have often been under pressure.” Despite multiple efforts to establish democratic systems, the consolidation of democratic norms and practices has been a challenge. By assessing its own strengths and weaknesses, the Pakistani Senate generated 14 recommendations for itself to become more effective.
In conclusion, it said that the IPU, in matters of democracy and parliamentary strengthening, does not dictate but rather facilitates so that parliaments drive the process, therefore fostering a sense of ownership and legitimacy. Pakistan is a case in point.

5,"Zardari, Raisi for more info exchanges on security",President speaks with Iranian counterpart; condemns Israeli attack on consulate,"President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday underlined the need for enhancing the exchange of information with Iran to overcome the security challenges being faced by the two countries.
Zardari spoke with Iranian President Seyed Ebrahim Raisi by the telephone. He offered his heartfelt condolences to the Iranian leadership and the bereaved families, who lost their dear ones in the Israeli attack on the Iranian embassy in Damascus this month.
The president also expressed his concern over the humanitarian crisis and the genocide being committed by the Israeli forces and called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
While exchanging greetings on the occasion of Eidul Fitr, President Zardari assured his Iranian counterpart that Pakistan would continue to work with Iran in all areas of mutual interest to further boost bilateral cooperation.

He also extended an invitation to the Iranian president to visit Pakistan. The president also wished the Iranian president and his family continued well-being, health and happiness.
The telephone call came amid reports that the Iranian president was expected to undertake an official visit to Pakistan in the third week of this month as part of efforts to remove mistrust after the two exchanged missiles in January.
There is no official word yet from either side about the exact dates of the visit but sources had told The Express Tribune that Raisi would be in Islamabad on April 22 on the first visit by any head of state to Pakistan since the new government took charge.
Iran launched missile strikes in Balochistan on January 16, claiming that it targeted terrorist hideouts. Pakistan rejected the claim and retaliated with its own strikes inside Iran, bringing the two neighbours on the verge of potential war.
However, the situation de-escalated quickly after high-level contact and both sides agreed to restore diplomatic ties and set new terms of engagements to avoid future escalation.
