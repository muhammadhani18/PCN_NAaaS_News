1,PPP opposes wheat import,LAHORE: The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) has opposed the government decision to import wheat.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) has opposed the government decision to import wheat.  
“The farmers of Punjab are very worried today. There has never been such a bad situation. The decision to import wheat is wrong,” PPP Punjab Senior Vice President Rana Farooq Saeed and Information Secretary Shahzad Saeed Cheema told a press conference here on Saturday.   
Rana Farooq said that in 2008, the PPP government had given a wheat support price of Rs900 to farmers and left the wheat stock of four years in 2013. He said wheat was being bought in the three provinces and only the farmers of Punjab were being abused.  
He said Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz should stop this cruelty and save the farmers, otherwise they would not sow wheat in the future.  He said despite cotton cultivation, the government support price had not been set.
“At least Rs11,000 per bale rate should be set. The TCP should buy all the cotton produced in the country and import should be banned,” he said.   
The PPP leader also urged President Asif Ali Zardari to take notice of this situation. They said the corn crop had broken the farmer’s back. “Mills, traders and investors have lost their confidence. Give subsidy on green tubewells and electricity.”   
The PPP said the Punjab government had not bought a grain of wheat in the market till now.  Shahzad Cheema said the investor was buying wheat at Rs2,900. The government should not make a policy of importing wheat and start exporting it, he added.

Thibault Cauvin, the most awarded classical guitarists of the world, who is also cultural ambassador of Bordeaux, came all the way from France to perform here in Pakistan. Though the renowned guitarist has performed in over 120 countries, it was his first performance in Pakistan.
The Hall 2 of Alhamra had a fairly good audience, including Lahore Arts Council Board of Governors’ Chairman Razi Ahmed.
Cauvin spellbound the audience by playing different music pieces on the guitar, including South American, Brazilian and French, he had composed while travelling around the world.  
The guitarist also did a fusion piece with two Pakistani instrumentalists -- Muhammad Hassan Pappu, who played the flute and Kashif Ali Dani on the Tabla.
The composition they performed together under the title, ‘Lahore’, will also be included in Cauvin’s new album to be released in Paris soon. 
Speaking on the occasion, French Cultural Centre Director Fabrice Disdier said he was thankful to the Lahore Arts Council and its chairman for organising this event. He also specially thanked Deputy Commissioner Rafia Haider who extended help in organising the concert.  
Throwing light on the musical journey of the celebrated guitarist, Mr Disdier said Cauvin was born into a family of musicians in Bordeaux, France, and by the age of 20 he had won 36 international prizes, including 13 first prizes. 
He is from the generation of the most accomplished classical guitarists. In the past 20 years, the guitarist has given more than 1,500 performances in more than 120 countries.
He said Cauvin has released more than 10 albums. In his latest album, he revisits the works of the towering German composer of late Baroque period, Johan Sebastian Bach.
Cauvin has performed on different prestigious stages, including New York’s Carnegie Hall, Moscow’s Tchaikovsky Hall and London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall.

3,Hard times for farmers after drop in rates of 3 crops,"Pakistan Kissan Ittehad demands cut in urea price, expeditious wheat procurement.","LAHORE: The agriculture is again facing hard times as farming community is experiencing a double jeopardy; on the one hand, cost of production has doubled since 2023 and, on the other, commodity prices of major crops (wheat, cotton and maize) have slid by 25 per cent on an average basis.
Khalid Mahmood Khokhar, president of Pakistan Kissan Ittehad (PKI), said this here on Saturday, issuing SOS (save our souls) calls for the sector. Cumulatively, both these factors have rendered farming business totally unviable.
During 2023, he says, farmers paid a huge amount of Rs300 billion (over and above to the MRPs, prescribed by the fertiliser industry) to the market exploiters on account of black marketing of urea. Despite continuous hue and cry by the farmers, the government failed to implement its writ and ensure availability of urea on prescribed rates. Despite these failures, farmers put in their best to ensure national food security by increasing area under wheat and per acre productivity, thus ensuring total national production of over 29 million tonnes – a record high production.
Keeping in view all these ‘adversaries’, farmers were expecting relief from the government through an increase in the support price of wheat – minimum of Rs4,000 per 40kg. However, instead of addressing the farmers’ agony, the government took a surprising step of importing huge quantities of wheat just ahead of the harvest, which caused a crash in wheat price in market from Rs3,900 to Rs3,000 per 40kg. Secondly, the government delivered another unprecedented blow to the farmers by increasing gas prices, causing an increase of urea price by around Rs1,000 per bag. This step shows policymakers have used the black-marketing tool as an opportunity by assuming that growers may absorb this hike in urea price, he says.  

PKI demands cut in urea price, expeditious wheat procurement

The current situation does not reveal a viable preposition for the farming business. The grievances of the farmers are piling up with the passage of every cropping season. If not addressed timely, this may pose a serious challenge to the national food security and economic prosperity of the country. Cotton contributes more than 60pc to the total national exports and is under serious threat as farmers are not able to invest to cultivate cotton in the current cropping season.
Khokhar recommends that the federal and provincial governments immediately start buying two million tonnes of wheat at the declared rate to help stabilise the market. Punjab contributes more than 75pc to the national wheat production.
The federal government should intervene to ensure urea at maximum rate of Rs4,000 per bag across the country instead of current market price of around Rs5,000 per bag.
To avoid foreseeable protests by the farmers, Pakistan Kissan Ittehad urges provincial and federal governments to take immediate actions to address the genuine issues of current wheat support price and availability of urea at affordable price throughout the country.  
Khokhar says the urea pricing issue has been pending since long with the federal government and now hurting farmers beyond redemption.

4,"Constable martyred, two ‘robbers’ killed in encounter",Another cop injured in the incident critical,"LAHORE: A police constable was martyred, two alleged robbers killed and another policeman was injured in an exchange of fire between police and criminals in Baghbanpura early on Saturday.
According to police, constables Ali Raza, Imran Haider and Dildar Hussain were performing duty near Mominpura petrol pump when they signalled two unidentified motorcyclists to stop. The motorcyclists, instead of halting, pulled out their guns and opened fire at the police team.  
As a result, constables Haider and Hussain suffered bullet injuries.
In retaliatory firing by the policemen, both motorcyclists also suffered bullet wounds and fell down.

Another cop injured in the incident critical

Police said that constable Haider and both motorcyclists succumbed to their injuries on the spot, while Constable Hussain was shifted to the Mayo Hospital for treatment. He is said to be in a critical condition.
Police shifted the bodies to the city morgue and started investigation. Later, the funeral prayers were offered for the martyred constable at the Police Lines, Qila Gujjar Singh.
Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar, Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Bilal Siddique Kamyana, DIG Operations Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, DIG Investigation Zeeshan Asghar and other officers and personnel of police attended the funeral prayers.
Constable Haider, a resident of Awan Dhai village in Batapur, was posted at Baghbanpura police station. He had eight children. 
The CCPO laid a floral wreath on his coffin, while a police contingent offered a salute to the martyred constable.
He issued directives for the best treatment of injured Head Constable Hussain. He said it was now the responsibility of Lahore police to look after constable Haider’s family, pledging his full support in this regard.
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz also paid tribute to the martyred constable, saying he had made Punjab Police proud.
She offered her condolences and expressed sympathies with the bereaved family.  
“Those who sacrifice their lives in the line of duty live forever,” the CM said in a statement.  
She also ordered provision of the best medical facilities to the injured constable.

5,LHC asks judges to protect rape  victims’ identity in verdicts,Orders Centre to implement anti-rape law effectively.,"LAHORE: Emphasising protection of the identity of rape victims and their family while writing judgements by the trial judges, the Lahore High Court has also ordered the federal government to ensure effective implementation of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act 2021.
“Child sexual abuse is a deeply traumatic and sensitive issue that demands that the justice system handle these cases with exceptional care and consideration for the unique needs and vulnerabilities of child victims,” said a judgement authored by Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh.  
The judgement also dismissed an appeal of a man against his conviction on charges of sexually assaulting a minor boy.
The judge noted that the parliament passed the anti-rape law in 2021 to effectively deal with rape and sexual abuse offences.

Orders Centre to implement anti-rape law effectively

However, he observed, regrettably, some of the provisions of the 2021 Act have not been implemented and the intended goals of the legislation have not been realised.
The judge noted that section 26 of the 2021 Act explicitly prohibits the disclosure or revelation of the identity of a victim or the victim’s family unless prior written permission is obtained from the aggrieved parties.
He said it is disturbing that, in the present case, the trial judge repeatedly used the victim’s full name instead of employing an acronym.  
The judge mentioned that when a child engages with the judicial system, the response should be supportive, collaborative, and aligned with a child right-driven approach.
He said involvement with the legal system can take various forms, such as being a party in a legal case, acting as a witness, undergoing legal proceedings, or seeking legal remedies.  
Justice Sheikh observed that although section 26 of the Act does not relate to printing or publication of the court judgments, it is essential to recognise that this provision was enacted with the societal goal of preventing social victimisation or ostracism of sexual offence victims.
“Therefore, judges should exercise extreme caution when writing judgments. Henceforth, they shall identify the victims using acronyms rather than full names,” the judge maintained in the order.
The judge directed the LHC registrar to circulate copies of the judgment to all the district and sessions judges in Punjab to ensure compliance of the instructions.
The judge also ordered the federal government to immediately review steps taken to implement the 2021 Act and ensure that the requisite systems are in place within 60 days.  
A sessions court had sentenced the appellant, Imadullah, 14-year imprisonment under section 377-B of PPC. The convict was a principal at a private school in Bahawalnagar and had sexually assaulted a class-IV student.

The JAC would hold its first meeting on Monday (tomorrow), LHCBA President Asad Manzoor Butt said in a statement.
The committee includes Supreme Court Bar Association President Shahzad Shaukat, Pakistan Bar Council members Ahsan Bhoon and Chaudhry Ishtiaq A Khan, Punjab Bar Council Vice Chairman Kamran Bashir Mughal, its member Muhammad Ahmad Qayyum, Lahore Bar Association President Munir Hussain Bhatti and LHCBA’s former vice president Rabbiya Bajwa.
The Lahore Bar Association also announced a complete boycott of the civil courts shifted to Model Town. The bar warned the violators of strict disciplinary action and cancellation of the membership.
The lawyers have been agitating against the unilateral decision of Lahore High Court’s former chief justice Ameer Bhatti about shifting civil courts from Aiwan-i-Adl to Model Town.
Before Ramazan, the bar leaders temporarily called off an over two-month long strike giving a ‘goodwill gesture’ to sitting Chief Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan.
The bars’ representatives who held multiple meetings with the new chief justice have been giving an impression to their members that the ‘disputed’ notification of the courts’ shifting would be withdrawn soon following the change of command in the high court. However, their optimism is yet to see a reality.

7,Harking Back: First English-language school to the missing ‘Qaida’,"With the defeat of the armies of the Lahore Darbar in 1849, the East India Company (EIC) took over in March of that...","With the defeat of the armies of the Lahore Darbar in 1849, the East India Company (EIC) took over in March of that year. In the Shahi Hammam inside Delhi Gate they set up their first court. Their three priorities were firstly, security, then agriculture, and then education.  
This piece concentrates on just how they tackled education in Lahore, and the Punjab. The EIC and colonial British rulers were not geared for education. But their traditional British education was then, and still largely remains, dependent on Christian missionaries. But first a few words about pre-EIC rule and education.
Famed educationalist, Dr G.W. Leitner, in his amazing research titled “History of Indigenous Education in the Punjab”, tells us of the Punjab having lost about a third of its native educational capacity, from 330,000 pupil or student places, before 1857, to about 190,000, in 1880. The basic education of girls and women was also apparently surprisingly catered for, with 18 formal schools for girls in Lahore alone. Cunningham’s ‘History of the Sikhs’ claim that women had a better basic education then men.  
The reason for this was that Maharaja Ranjit Singh loved to receive letters. To communicate one had to send him a letter. Thus, he made it compulsory for everyone to be able to write a letter, leading to a policy where ‘every village in the Punjab, through the tehsildar, had an ample supply of the Punjabi ‘Qaida’, which was compulsory for females’. Thus, almost every Punjabi woman was literate in the sense that she could read and write the ‘Lunde’ form of Gurmukhi.
Come the British and the Punjabi-educated elite virtually disappeared, largely because of attempts to introduce English to the elite and Urdu for the masses.  
Prof. Leitner wrote: “As a result of British actions, ‘the true education of the Punjab was crippled, checked and nearly destroyed.’”
In such circumstances the very first English-medium school in the whole of the northern sub-continent was set up by two American missionaries named Charles William Forman and John Newton on Dec 19, 1849 as Lahore Mission School. It was the first English-medium school in northern India at the time of its establishment, and the first classes of the school were started under a tree with three students.  
The EIC informed the priests that Punjabi was not to be taught, a stricture they initially ignored.
Very soon the number of students grew to seven and as the classes expanded under the tree, the two Americans just could not stand the heat of the sun. In 1850 with record heat of the EIC soldiers then quartered in the Lahore Fort, almost 10 per cent of them died of heat stroke and malaria. Newton returned to recover in America, while Forman decided to live in the tomb of Nusrat Khan in Mughalpura.
The school was later shifted to Haveli Rang Mahal in 1852, in a huge mansion previously owned by Saadullah Khan, a wazir of Emperor Shah Jahan. It was officially acquired by the mission to establish a school, named the Rang Mahal Mission School.
This very first English-medium school of Lahore, and the Punjab, started off under the administration of the Presbyterian Education Trust. Forman decided that only good scientific education would be of use, and he ordered $600 worth of scientific equipment. So Rang Mahal School had the Punjab’s finest scientific laboratory.
By 1854 the school had become famous and with its amazing science laboratory it had 200 students. Along with mathematics all students had to study the Bible. In the spirit of fairness, the Rang Mahal School got printed the very first Punjabi dictionary. This was to meet the linguistic needs of the local population.
In those day the Company clerks from Delhi and Bengal had not yet asserted their Urdu influence. The missionaries also translated a lot of European books into Hindi, Urdu and Persian. In 1864 the American missionaries set up the Forman Christian College (FCC) at the Rang Mahal school building, but then shifted it to Napier Road in 1889, and then to its current location alongside the Lahore Canal in 1940.
Parallel to this missionary effort the British rulers decided that it was best that the finest British government educational institutions be tapped to set up in Lahore. Towards that end they advertised for a scholar to set up Lahore’s Government College, and in 1864 Prof G.W. Leitner, an outstanding linguist was selected from Kings College London to: ‘educate Indian students to serve the colonial administration in important positions’.
The Government College was set up in 1864 in the Haveli of Dhian Singh inside the walled city of Lahore. In 1873 it shifted to the ‘kothi’ of Rahim Khan. In 1876 it moved to its present building, which was built next to the Ranjit Singh ‘horse coach’ building that today is known as the college’s gymnasium. Prof. G.W. Leitner was the first principal.  
So, we see that the American Presbyterian missionaries of the USA launched the very first English-medium school of Lahore, as also of the Punjab as also of the whole of northern sub-continent. These missionaries went on to set up the very first English-language college, which they still manage.
The British rulers believed that a much more neutral college was needed, and so Prof G.W. Leitner set off founding not only the Government College of Lahore, but also the Oriental College and then in 1882 the Punjab University. He was the university’s first registrar.
A year later a school named the Central Model School was opened, initially in Anarkali, but later a building to one side of the Central Training College became the present school in 1891. Parallel to this government effort, another Catholic school, the St. Anthony’s High School, was set up in 1892 by the Capuchin Friars from Belgium whose patron saint was St. Anthony of Padua. It started with three students on Empress Road where Don Bosco is today. In 1900 it shifted to its present Lawrence Road site. In 1978 it was handed over to the Irish Marist Fathers.
Prof. Leitner was able to achieve his reforms largely because he was considered an outsider, for he was a white European of Hungarian origin. He was able to speak 50 languages, and while travelling through Muslim countries he named himself as ‘Abdur Rashid Sayyah’. He learnt the Quran by heart and wrote three books on Islam which are considered masterpieces.  
At this point let me narrate an incident in which this column suggested that ‘Katchery Road’ be rename Leitner Road, for on both sides of the road are his creations, they are the GC Lahore, the Oriental College, and the Punjab University.  
In the Punjab Assembly Rana Sanaullah opposed the suggestion claiming he has nothing to do with Islam. This columnist retorted that Britain’s first mosque – the Woking Mosque – was built by Prof. Leitner, and our column suggested that he should read the scholarly book ‘History of Islam’ by Leitner. The Rana went silent. One hopes he has read those amazing books.  
So, while the pioneering first English-language school at Rang Mahal, and its off-shoot the Forman Christian College, stuck to its English medium way of education, the Government College Lahore under Leitner concentrated on languages and literature, and later in sciences, it reflected the days to come.
Leitner believed the best learning comes about if local languages and its culture are central to all educational efforts. He said: “We must raise the spirit of self-reliance among the Natives”. This the British rulers did not like who were bent on eradicating the Punjabi language. That effort the colonial-trained bureaucrats of a free Pakistan continue to follow.  
From the first English-language school set up by American missionaries in the year that the Sikh rule ended in 1849 to today 175 years later we have more ‘madressah’ schools teaching Arabic as given in the Quran. There is not a single local language school. Women are discouraged from reading any ‘Qaida’. The original Mission School of Rang Mahal now run by the government, has only 10 teachers and a handful of students. The tragedy is clear.
