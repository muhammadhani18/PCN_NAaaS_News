0,North Korea tests ‘super-large warhead’,"North Korea also carries out a test launch of a  “‘Pyoljji-1-2’ new-type anti-aircraft missile in the West Sea of Korea”, KCNA says.","SEOUL: North Korea has tested a  “super-large warhead” designed for a strategic cruise missile, state media said on Saturday, the most recent test since UN sanctions monitoring against the nuclear-armed nation was upended last month by Russia.
The announcement comes after Russia in March used its United Nations Security Council veto to effectively end UN monitoring of violations of the raft of sanctions on Kim Jong Un’s government for its nuclear and weapons programme.
Analysts have warned that North Korea could be testing cruise missiles ahead of sending them to Russia for use in Ukraine, with Washington and Seoul claiming Kim has shipped weapons to Moscow, despite UN sanctions banning any such moves. “The DPRK Missile Administration has conducted a power test of a super-large warhead designed for ‘Hwasal-1 Ra-3’ strategic cruise missile”, KCNA news agency said on Saturday, referring to North Korea by an abbreviation for its official name.
North Korea also carried out a test launch of a  “‘Pyoljji-1-2’ new-type anti-aircraft missile in the West Sea of Korea”, KCNA said, adding that both tests were carried out on Friday afternoon. Seoul’s military said it detected  “several cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles” fired toward the same body of water, also known as the Yellow Sea, at around 3:30pm on Friday.
It added that it was  “closely watching” the North’s military activities, and if Pyongyang  “commits a provocation, we will punish it overwhelmingly and resolutely”. This year, Pyongyang has declared South Korea its  “principal enemy”, jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over  “even 0.001 mm” of territorial infringement.
Unlike their ballistic counterparts, the testing of cruise missiles is not banned under current UN sanctions on North Korea.
Cruise missiles tend to be jet-propelled and fly at a lower altitude than more sophisticated ballistic missiles, making them harder to detect and intercept.

1,US to withdraw troops from Niger,"WASHINGTON: The United States agreed on Friday to withdraw its more than 1,000 troops from Niger, officials said,...","WASHINGTON: The United States agreed on Friday to withdraw its more than 1,000 troops from Niger, officials said, upending its posture in West Africa where the country was home to a major drone base.
The long-expected move effectively marks a new regional gain for Russia, which has ramped up its focus on Africa and backed military regimes in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso.
Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell accepted the call to remove troops in a meeting in Washington with the prime minister of the junta, Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine, US officials said.
They agreed that a US delegation would head within days to the capital Niamey to arrange an orderly withdrawal, the officials said. Nigerien state television earlier announced that the US officials would visit next week.
The State Department made no immediate public announcement and officials said no timeline was yet set to withdraw the troops.
Niger was long a linchpin in the US and French strategy to combat jihadists in West Africa. The United States built a base in the desert city of Agadez at the cost of $100 million to fly a fleet of drones.

2,Man dies after setting himself ablaze outside court trying Trump,Witnesses say the man pulled pamphlets from a backpack and threw them in the air before he doused himself with a liquid and set himself on fire.,"NEW YORK: A man has died after setting himself on fire on Friday outside the New York courthouse where Donald Trump’s historic hush-money trial was taking place as jury selection wrapped up, but officials said he did not appear to have been targeting Trump.
The man burned for several minutes in full view of television cameras that were set up outside the courthouse, where the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president is being held.
An NYPD spokesperson said the man was declared dead overnight at a hospital. Officials had previously said he was in critical condition. Witnesses said the man, who was in his 30s, pulled pamphlets from a backpack and threw them in the air before he doused himself with a liquid and set himself on fire. One of those pamphlets included references to  “evil billionaires” but portions that were visible did not mention Trump.
The NYPD said the man, who they identified as Max Azzarello of St. Augustine, Florida, did not appear to be targeting Trump or others involved in the trial. “Right now we are labeling him as sort of a conspiracy theorist, and we are going from there,” Tarik Sheppard, a deputy police commissioner, said at a news conference.
In an online manifesto, a man using that name said he set himself on fire and apologised to friends, witnesses and first responders. The post warns of  “an apocalyptic fascist coup” and criticises cryptocurrency and US politicians, but does not single out Trump in particular.
A smell of smoke lingered in the plaza after the incident, according to a witness, and a police officer sprayed a fire extinguisher on the ground. A smoldering backpack and a gas can were visible. The downtown Manhattan courthouse, heavily guarded by police, drew a throng of protesters and onlookers on Monday, the trial’s first day, though crowds have since dwindled.
The shocking development came shortly after jury selection for the trial was completed, clearing the way for prosecutors and defense attorneys to make opening statements on Monday in a case stemming from hush money paid to a porn star. The court adjourned later in the afternoon.
The 12 jurors, along with six alternates, will consider evidence in a first-ever trial to determine whether a former US president is guilty of breaking the law. Prosecutors intend to call at least 20 witnesses, according to Trump defence lawyer Susan Necheles. Trump may testify on his own behalf, in a risky move that would open him up to cross-examination.
The jury consists of seven men and five women, mostly employed in white-collar professions: two corporate lawyers, a software engineer, a speech therapist and an English teacher. Most are not native New Yorkers, hailing from across the United States and countries including Ireland and Lebanon. The alternates, who will also hear the case, are held in reserve in case one of the jurors has to leave due to illness or some other cause.
Trump is accused of covering up a $130,000 payment his then-lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she says they had a decade earlier.

3,Myanmar rebels target stranded junta troops,"YANGON: Fighting raged at Myanmar’s eastern frontier with Thailand on Saturday, both governments said, forcing...","YANGON: Fighting raged at Myanmar’s eastern frontier with Thailand on Saturday, both governments said, forcing 3,000 civilians to flee as rebels fought to flush out Myanmar junta troops holed up for days at a bridge border crossing.
Resistance fighters and ethnic minority rebels seized the key trading town of Myawaddy on the Myanmar side of the frontier on April 11, a blow to a well-equipped military struggling to govern and facing a test of battlefield credibility.
Witnesses on the Thai and Myanmar sides of the border said they heard explosions and heavy machine gun fire near a strategic bridge from late on Friday into Saturday.
Thai broadcaster NBT, in a post on X, said resistance forces used 40-mm machine guns and dropped 20 bombs from drones to target an estimated 200 junta soldiers who had retreated from a coordinated rebel assault on Myawaddy and army posts since April 5.
Myanmar’s state-run MRTV in its nightly newscast said the militias and ethnic minority rebels had used excessive shelling and bombing to attack junta troops, and government forces had responded with air strikes to try to maintain stability.

4,"Russia quietly leaves Karabakh, ceding its clout ‘for good’",Caucasian observers say Moscow is too caught up with its invasion of Ukraine to retain its sway in the region,"BAKU: When Russian troops deplo­yed to Nagorno-Karabakh four years ago, their task was clear: keep the peace between bitter foes Armenia and Azerbaijan and prevent another war in the volatile region.
But as Azerbaijani forces swept through mountainous Karabakh last September and crushed Armenian separatist forces in a matter of hours, the Russian mission looked lost.
The Kremlin this week quietly confirmed that the peacekeepers were withdrawing, taking with them their weapons and hardware, as well as Russian clout from a region it long considered its own backyard.
“We are witnessing a historic process — Russians are leaving for the first time in two centuries,” independent Azerbaijani analyst Elhan Shahinoglu said. Moscow ruled over the Caucasus region first during the Russian empire and then in the Soviet era. When war broke out between Armenia and Azerbaijan after the USSR’s collapse, Moscow sought to mediate.

Caucasian observers say Moscow is too caught up with its invasion of Ukraine to retain its sway in the region

The Kremlin deployed almost 2,000 troops in 2020 as part of a ceasefire deal that halted six weeks of brutal fighting between the arch-foes over the Karabakh region.
The accord held until the lightning Azerbaijani offensive last September that ignited an exodus of more than 100,000 Armenians from Karabakh and deepened their frustration with Moscow.
Russia ‘betrayed us’ 
“Along with the Russians leaving Karabakh, the last hope that the population will return home is gone,” said Iveta Margaryan, a 53-year-old trained accountant on the streets of Armenia’s capital. “The Russians have betrayed us,” she added.
Observers of the Caucasus say Russia is too caught up with its invasion of Ukraine to retain its sway in the region. Azerbaijan has recently deepened ties with Turkiye — a close military and political partner with shared cultural ties. And with the pullout from Karabakh, Moscow has further alienated Armenia.
Yerevan has criticised Moscow’s perceived shortfalls, with Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan busy forging closer ties with the West. In February, he froze Yerevan’s participation in the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation, a defence grouping of several ex-Soviet states.
Yerevan also joined the International Criminal Court (ICC) against Moscow’s wishes — a move that obligates it to arrest Vladimir Putin should he visit Armenia.
The European Union and United States are now leading efforts to broker a peace agreement between the Caucasus foes, with Moscow stuck playing second fiddle.
‘Shattered’ myth
Moscow’s unease over Armenia’s rappro­chement with the West has also become public. The foreign ministry this week deman­ded that Yerevan  “disavow” reports it was deepening military ties with Western countries.
France — home to a large Armenian diaspora — has also planted a flag in the region, intensifying its diplomatic backing for Yerevan and providing cutting-edge defensive radars and missiles. “Russia is out, the West is in,” said Azerbaijani political scientist Eldar Namazov.

5,Mass protests in Canary Islands decry overtourism,MADRID: Tens of thousands of demonstrators hit the streets across Spain’s Canary Islands on Saturday to demand...,"MADRID: Tens of thousands of demonstrators hit the streets across Spain’s Canary Islands on Saturday to demand changes to the model of mass tourism they say is overwhelming the Atlantic archipelago.
Rallying under the slogan  “The Canary Islands have a limit”, demonstrators began rallying at midday, flag-waving crowds packing the streets of the main towns across all of the archipelago’s seven islands.
Chanting and whistling, they waved scores of placards and banners emblazoned with slogans reading:  “The Canary Islands are not up for sale!” or  “A moratorium on tourism” while others simply said:  “Respect my home”.
Organisers say mass tourism perpetuates an economic model that harms local residents and are demanding the authorities limit the numbers. Police said 20,000 demonstrators had turned out for the demonstrations, but organisers put the figure closer to 50,000, Spain’s public television said.
“We are not against tourism,” one woman demonstrator called Rosario Correo told Spain’s TVE public television.
“We’re asking that they change this model that allows for unlimited growth of tourism.” They are calling for a halt to the work on two new hotels on Tenerife, the largest and most developed of the archipelago’s seven islands. And they also want residents to be given a greater say in what they see as uncontrolled development which is harming the environment.

6,EU urged to ‘deepen’ ties with states where migrants originate,"Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska says there is “still a long way to go"".","LAS PALMAS: Ministers from five Mediterranean nations on Saturday urged the EU to  “deepen” bilateral agreements with migrant countries of origin and increase funding to tackle the root causes of migration.
Meeting on Gran Cana­ria Island, interior and migration ministers from the so-called MED5 nations — Cyprus, Gree­ce, Italy, Malta and Spain — discussed the new migration and asylum pact adopted by the EU parliament on April 11.
Years in the making, the deal involves a sweeping reform of the bloc’s asylum policies that will both harden border procedures while forcing all 27 nations to share responsibility for migrant arrivals.
The reform was spurred by the massive influx of migrants in 2015, with its provisions taking effect in 2026.
Hailing the pact as  “historic”, Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said there was  “still a long way to go” and that the solution lay in  “prevention” and addressing the root causes of migration  “at its source”.
“The key to migration management lies in bilateral cooperation,” he told a news conference, urging the European Commission  “to deepen and broaden partnerships and agreements with third countries” to stem flows of irregular migrants.
“But we believe there is room for improvement and the commitment should also focus on increasing European funds and flexible financing tools destined for such cooperation,” he said.
Under current EU rules, the arrival country bears responsibility for hosting and vetting asylum-seekers and returning those deemed inadmissible, which has put southern frontline states under huge pressure, fuelling far-right opposition.
The new EU pact, which includes building border centres to hold asylum-seekers and sending some to outside  “safe” countries, has been denounced by migrant charities and NGOs, with Amnesty International warning it would  “lead to greater human suffering”.

7,Palestinians to reconsider US ties after membership veto,China says admitting Palestinian state to UN is move to rectify injustice.,"RAMALLAH: The Palestinian Authority will  “reconsider” its relationship with the United States after Washington vetoed a Palestinian bid for full UN membership earlier this week, president Mahmud Abbas said on Saturday.
“The Palestinian leadership will reconsider bilateral relations with the United States to ensure the protection of our people’s interests, our cause, and our rights,” Abbas told the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.
Wafa said his remarks came  “on the heels of the United States’ use of veto power” at the UN Security Council.
Thursday’s vote saw 12 countries on the Council back a resolution recommending full Palestinian membership and two — Britain and Switzerland — abstain. Only the United States, Israel’s staunchest ally, voted against, using its veto to block the resolution.

China says admitting Palestinian state to UN is move to rectify injustice

Abbas said the Palestinian leadership will  “develop a new strategy to protect Palestinian national decisions independently and follow a Palestinian agenda rather than an American vision or regional agendas”.
He said Palestinians would  “not remain hostage to policies that have proven their failure and have been exposed to the entire world”.
And he said the stance of the US government had  “generated unprecedented anger among the Palestinian people and the region’s populations, potentially pushing the region towards further instability, chaos and terrorism”.
State to rectify injustice
China’s  foreign minister Wang Yi on Saturday said efforts to admit a  Palestinian state into the United Nations were a move to rectify a  prolonged injustice, state media Xinhua reported.
He made the comments at a joint press conference with his Papua New Guinea counterpart during a visit to country.
The  United States on Thursday effectively stopped the UN from recognising a  Palestinian state by casting a veto in the Security Council to deny  Palestinians full membership of the world body.
“A prompt  admission of Palestine into the United Nations is a move to rectify a  prolonged historical injustice,” Xinhua quoted Wang as saying.

8,Prosecution seeks 12 years jail for duo in ‘Panama Papers’ trial,"Prosecutor requests a sentence of 12 years in prison, the maximum for money laundering, for Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca.","PANAMA CITY: Hear­ings in the money-laundering trial of the heads of the now-defunct law firm Mossack Fonseca, the epicentre of the global  “Pana­ma Papers” scandal, concluded on Friday in the Panamanian capital.
Following 10 days of hear­ings, a sentence is expected in the coming weeks, with judge Baloisa Marquinez saying she would take advantage of a law giving her 30 working days to render a verdict — or potentially more in cases of lengthy proceedings.
Prosecutor Isis Soto has requested a sentence of 12 years in prison, the maximum for money laundering, for Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca, the founders of the firm whose practices were at the heart of the scandal that erupted in 2016.
Documents leaked from Mossack Fonseca revea­led how many of the world’s wealthy stashed assets in offshore companies, triggering scores of investigations around the globe.
“There has truly been a great injustice committed, not only against me, but against all the people that have worked with me, of whom there are many,” Mossack said at the end of the trial.
“I reiterate that both my partner and all the people who have worked with me have been serious, honest and correct people.” The pair are on trial alongside more than two dozen others, mainly former employees. Fonseca did not attend the hearings for medical reasons.
The prosecution accuses Mossack and Fonseca of  “concealing, covering up and providing false information to banks for the opening of accounts and concealing ownership of assets.” The pair are also alleged to have  “received and transferred funds from illicit activities in Germany and Argentina.” Guillermina McDonald, a lawyer for Mossack and other defendants, said that the trial had been flawed.
