• Pakistan says ‘discriminatory’ approaches hurt credibility of non-proliferation regimes
• Points out such listings took place in the past ‘without sharing any evidence whatsoever’
ISLAMABAD  /  WASHINGTON: Pakistan rejected the “political use of export controls” after the United States imposed sanctions on four entities for their alleged involvement in supplying “missile-applicable items” to Pakistan’s ballistic missile programme, the Foreign Office said on Saturday. 
The US State Department claimed on Friday evening that the entities — three Chinese and one from Belarus — were particularly assisting Pakistan’s long-range missile endeavours.
The statement specified that “the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behaviour”.
The entities facing sanctions include the Belarus-based Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant, the People’s Republic of China-based Xi’an Longde Technology Development Company Limited, Tianjin Crea­tive Source International Trade Co Ltd and Granpect Company Limited.
As per the sanctions imposed under Executive Order 13382, all property and interests in property of the designated entities that are in the United States or under the control of US persons are now blocked. Furthermore, any individuals or entities with ownership, directly or indirectly, of 50 per cent or more by the designated persons are also subject to these sanctions. 
These measures prohibit transactions involving any property or interests in property of designated or blocked persons unless authorised by the Office of Foreign Assets Control or exempt. This includes contributions and provision of funds, goods, or services to or from any blocked person.
Moreover, the entry of designated individuals into the United States has been suspended under Presidential Proclamation 8693.
The US government explained that “the integrity of these sanctions lies not only in the ability to designate and add persons to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, but also in the willingness to remove persons from the list in accordance with the law”.
Following the sanctions, FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch issued a statement, saying: “We reject political use of export controls. It is well known that the same jurisdictions, which claim strict adherence to non-proliferation controls, have waived off licensing requirements for advanced military technologies for some countries.”
She added that “such discriminatory approaches and double standards” undermine the credibility of non-proliferation regimes and also the objectives of regional and global peace and security by “accentuating military asymmetries”.
Ms Baloch said that such listings of commercial entities took place in the past as well on allegations of links to Pakistan’s ballistic missile programme “without sharing any evidence whatsoever”.
Washington alleged that it had sanctioned Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant for supplying special vehicle chassis used as launch support equipment for ballistic missiles.
Xi’an Longde Technology Development Company Limited, the US claimed, supplied equipment including a filament winding machine. The winding machine is said to be essential for producing rocket motor cases.
Tianjin Creative Source International Trade Co Ltd is accused of providing stir welding equipment and a linear accelerator system, technologies assessed by the United States as pivotal in manufacturing propellant tanks and inspecting solid rocket motors, respectively. These items were suspected by US to be intended for Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), which develops and produces MTCR Category I ballistic missiles.
Granpect Company Limited is alleged to have supplied to both Suparco and NDC testing equipment for large diameter rocket motors, which are crucial for the missile development process.
The spokesperson said Pakistan was ready to discuss end-use and end-user verification mechanisms so that legitimate commercial users were not hurt by the “discriminatory application” of export controls.
‘Carrot & stick policy’
Shuja Nawaz, a fellow at the South Asia Center of the Atlantic Council in Washington, told Dawn that “the nub of US sanctions on four entities allegedly supplying missile technology to Pakistan is captured in its stated aim: the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behaviour.” But he also noted that the sanctions directly punished Pakistan for pursuing the development of missiles.
Mr Nawaz suggested that Pakistani authorities should also “ask themselves who inside Pakistan provided the information to American authorities?”

1,IMF team expected next month for new loan talks,Aura­ngzeb says debts can be repaid only after CPEC-II.,"WASHINGTON: Finance Minister Muhammad Aura­ngzeb revealed on Saturday that an IMF team is anticipated to visit Pakistan by mid-May to negotiate a new long-term process, aiming to secure a staff-level agreement by mid-July.
Speaking to US-Pakistani media at the conclusion of his week-long visit, the minister mentioned the Fund’s intention to expedite the process. “The contours of the new programme will shape up later. We will start getting into granularity of the programme by mid-May,” he added.
Addressing journalists at the Pakistan Embassy, Mr Aurangzeb expressed the hope that the IMF’s board of governors would convene to consider the last tranche of the current programme by the end of this month, with the final installment released shortly thereafter.
 
 

Pakistan is seeking a $6-8 billion new loan package from the end. In earlier statements, he said Pakistan would prefer a long-term, preferably a three-year programme.

Aura­ngzeb says debts can be repaid only after CPEC-II

But when asked at Satur­day’s briefing, Mr Aurangzeb said he would not speculate the size or the duration of the programme yet.
Second phase of CPEC
Earlier, Mr Aurangzeb informed a Chinese television audience that Pakistan can repay its debt to China only after completing the second phase of CPEC.
The minister’s candid remarks followed discussions with key financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank, alongside senior US  officials in Washington this week.
Explaining his stance on this sensitive issue, Mr Aurangzeb said: “CPEC was a champion project for Pakistan, and a lot of infrastructure was created during its first phase. Now, what’s supposed to happen was for us to go into CPEC Phase 2, which was and remains the way we monetise that infrastructure because  that’s where the special economic zones come in.”
The minister elabora­t­­ed that through these special economic zones, Pak­i­­­s­tan was to attract further Chinese investment.
Emphasising the necessity of completing this process, the  minister stated: “There’s a lot of discussion about how you are going to  repay the debt, that’s how it was supposed to happen.”
He expressed gratitude to the Chinese government and banks for their assistance in debt servicing, noting, “But ultimately, these debts have to be paid. And that’s only going to be there when we get phase 2  going in real earnestness.”
In an earlier meeting with Chinese Finance Minister Lan Fo’an in  Washington, Mr Aurang­zeb commended China’s invaluable contribution to  Pakistan’s development through initiatives like CPEC.
He discussed Phase-I’s focus on infrastructure-building and  Phase-II’s emphasis on special economic zones and relocation of Chinese private-owned companies, as per a statement issued by his office.
Mr Aurangzeb expres­sed gratitude for Chinese support,  particularly its SAFE deposits. He informed his Chinese counterpart about Pakistan’s broader IMF programme and its interest in accessing the Chinese bond market with a Panda Bond.
 
 

On Saturday, the finance minister met representatives from S&P Global and Fitch Ratings, sharing the country’s positive indicators under the IMF’s SBA.
He also highlighted the ongoing reforms in taxation, energy, and privatisation across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons.
Additionally, the minister discussed the alignment of the World Bank’s agenda with government priorities, including climate change and digitalisation.
He mentioned potential Saudi investments and addressed concerns from rating agencies regarding the external side, inflation,  primary balance, and interest rates.

2,Imran urges CJP to ensure ‘supremacy of Constitution’,"ISLAMABAD: In his second letter to the top judge, former prime minister Imran Khan has urged Chief Justice of...","ISLAMABAD: In his second letter to the top judge, former prime minister Imran Khan has urged Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa to take notice of the “excesses” of the state and ensure the supremacy of the Constitution. 
The PTI founder, who is incarcerated in Adiala Jail, listed several issues that, according to him, required the CJP’s intervention. These include the letter of the high court judges claiming meddling by intelligence officials in the judicial affairs, the May 9 cases against PTI supporters, a face-off bet­ween the army and police officials in Bahawalnagar, non-allocation of reserved seats to the PTI, the Toshakhana case against ex-PM Nawaz Sharif, and the rigging allegations levelled by the former Rawalpindi commissioner, Liaquat Chatha.
“Inaction on your part and that of the Supreme Court in the face of each of the aforementioned matters of grave importance would exacerbate the constitutional crisis the country is already faced with and push it closer and closer to the abyss,” the letter stated.
This was the second letter by Imran Khan to CJP Isa since November last year. In his previous letter, he requested the top judge to protect the party’s fundamental rights. CJP Qazi Faez Isa, in response, through a press release from his office stated that he would “neither be pressurised nor favour anyone”.
In the fresh letter, Mr Khan said the “new lows to which the state of the rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution has fallen in Pakistan have caused the gradual emergence of the law of the jungle and the enactment of the primitive doctrine that might is right”.
“I have no doubt that if our Superior Judiciary, with your good-self at its helm, would not meaningfully intervene as the custodian of the Constitution and the ultimate arbiter of justice, and if the foregoing situation were to prevail, it would be fatal to any civilised order in the world,” Mr Khan feared.
About the May 9 cases, Mr Khan claimed that “the State, however, is acting as judge, jury and executioner in all these trials; first, directly through military courts, on the constitutionality of which the Supreme Court has been dragging its feet for longer than it should, and, secondly, in an indirect manner, by holding guns to the heads of the subordinate court judges who are conducting the trials.”
“As, what I believe to be the majority of our populace, faces the wrath of the State, now is the time for you to prove whether your declared belief in the principles and values espoused by Pakistan’s founding fathers, and your proclamation of the supremacy of the Constitution, are for real or were mere hollow rhetoric,” Mr Khan said.
He also reminded the CJP about the reference filed against him in the Supreme Judicial Council. 
“When, a few years ago, you [CJP] were faced with the wrath of the State in the form of a reference in the Supreme Judicial Council, you waxed eloquent on various forums about how your late father was a close associate of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, and how the two historic figures espoused the same principles and values.  Similarly, last year, while speaking in the joint sitting of parliament…you held the Constitution in your hand in full public view, and proclaimed that this book was your guiding light after the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (PBUH),” he stated.
He ended the letter with a quote from scientist Albert Einstein: “The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.”
Bushra Bibi’s medical
In a related development, Bushra Bibi’s medical was held at Shifa International Hospital Islamabad. 
The PTI alleged that the former first lady was ‘poisoned’ as shown by the check-up.
A representative of the hospital, however, said that it “does not share” information about patients because of privacy concerns.
