1,KP govt asked to declare Khyber calamity-hit,Rains destroy dozens of houses and cause irreparable damage to standing wheat crop and vegetable fields.,"KHYBER: Rain and flood-hit families and welfare organisations in Khyber have demanded of the provincial government to declare the tribal district as calamity-hit and provide immediate relief to the affected people.
Representatives of Sipah Khidmat-i-Khalq Welfare Society in Bara and Khudai Khidmatgar Tanzeem in Landi Kotal said heavy rains caused flash floods, which played havoc in different parts of Khyber, destroying dozens of houses and causing irreparable damage to standing wheat crop and vegetable fields, particularly in Bara plain, upper Bara, Shalman, Malagori and parts of Tirah valley during the last few days.
Demanding a change in the standard operating procedure for reporting of the damaged structures, these organisations asked the government departments to immediately start relief operations instead of asking for pictures of the damaged houses as most of the affected families were compelled to live under the open sky with more rains predicted in coming days.
They demanded of Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to direct the departments concerned to accelerate relief work.
Expressing displeasure over the performance of district administration, local government and the parliamentarians, Khudai Khidmatgar Tanzeem alleged no concrete steps were taken to alleviate the sufferings of rain-hit people.
It said at least five bridges were required on the main Peshawar-Torkham highway to ensure smooth traffic flow during floods.

2,Gandhara Corridor Bill bid to seize KP’s resources,Bill craftily designed to appropriate remnants of KP’s Gandhara Civilisation and divert profits from KP’s Buddhist religious tourism to Centre.,"Ninety per cent of Gandhara sites in the country are located in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
The soon-to-be-introduced “Gandhara Corridor Bill 2024” in the NA is seen as a blatant attempt to capture KP’s resources. The province is rich in natural and historic resources, with hydroelectric power, mines and minerals, and tourism ranking highly in generating income for the province.
Though KP has repeatedly been urging the centre to release its royalty on net hydel profit and natural gas royalty, amounting to billions in unpaid dues, the latest assault on its resources comes from the aforementioned bill set to be tabled in the National Assembly.
The bill is craftily designed to appropriate remnants of KP’s Gandhara Civilisation and divert the profits from KP’s Buddhist religious tourism to the centre.
The proponent of the bill is Mr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, an MNA from Sindh, who made a similar attempt in the past that was rejected by the Senate Standing Committee on National Heritage and Culture.
 
 

Last year, he introduced the Gandhara Cultural Authority Act, 2023, which was deferred by the standing committee. Now, he has reintroduced a similar bill, this time with the deceptive name of “Gandhara Corridor Bill, 2024.” Evidently, he is positioning himself for its chairman’s slot. Is he merely a front man acting at the behest of behind-the-scenes planners? This is the question on everyone’s mind in KP.
Constitutionally, this controversial bill violates the 18th Constitutional Amendment as the subject pertaining to the affairs of ‘Ancient and Historic Monuments, Archaeological Sites, and Remains’ was transferred to respective provinces after the abolition of the concurrent list.
It is also a redundant piece of legislation and directly encroaches upon the province’s institutions and existing laws that govern Gandharan sites in KP.
The proposed bill outlines the acquisition of property, both movable and immovable, containing Gandharan remains in the possession of KP. Financial earnings from KP’s sites, as well as grants and donor funding, are mandated to be deposited into the Gandhara Corridor Account, according to the proposed legislation.
The Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC), a federal body, was bypassed and not consulted regarding the proposed law. The PTDC is mandated to support and facilitate the provinces under its charter.
By establishing a parallel organisation within the federal government, this bill, after enactment, shall render the PTDC’s role useless, stifling its existence.
Instead, efforts should be made to open a religious tourism facilitation centre inside the PTDC for international tourists coming to Pakistan. Assisting them with NOCs will help market Pakistan as a destination for religious tourism internationally more effectively.
The chief minister of KP has vehemently opposed the bill and condemned its contents in the strongest terms. A cross-section of politicians from various parties in the province and heritage experts have also criticised it in unison. Legal experts from KP have insisted that the bill is flawed.

4,Journalists vow to help combat climate change,PESHAWAR: The Global Neighbourhood for Media Innovation (GNMI) in collaboration with the US Department of State...,"PESHAWAR: The Global Neighbourhood for Media Innovation (GNMI) in collaboration with the US Department of State organised a three-day Sabz Journalism Environmental Journalism training in Peshawar.
A statement issued here said led by senior environmental journalist Afia Salam, the training aimed to empower mid-level journalists, digital content producers and filmmakers actively engaged in climate-related reporting across various media platforms.
The comprehensive programme covered topics such as understanding the science of environment, distinguishing between climate and environment, data-driven and investigative story production, digital storytelling techniques, and strategies for content dissemination. 
Hands-on learning activities were integrated to enhance participants’ production skills with a focus on incorporating environmental perspectives into their routine reporting.
During the training session, participants referenced a recent report by UNDP Pakistan, revealing alarming trends in glacier melt and glacial lake formation in the region. 
The report identified a total of 3,044 glacial lakes in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with 33 of these lakes assessed as prone to hazardous glacial lake outburst flooding (Glof) due to rising temperatures and rapid glacial retreat.
Local journalists also highlighted that as temperatures rose and rainfall patterns shifted, the delicate balance of nature was thrown into disarray. They said extreme weather events, once rare, now ravaged communities in Chitral, Lower and Upper Dir and other northern parts of KP with increasing frequency, leaving devastation in their wake. 
Some metropolitan journalists also highlighted the pressing issues of noise and air pollution in Peshawar city, pointing out the multifaceted environmental challenges faced by communities in the city area.
The participants also brought to the attention of the lead trainer a media report indicating that more than 210 forest fires in KP had ravaged 14,430 acres of land. Alarmingly, the report revealed that 55 of these fires were deliberately started by locals as reported by the provincial forest department.
At the end of the session, Afia Salam stressed the need to amplify environmental stories for greater public awareness and spur policy interventions.

5,Kalam people call for road repair,SWAT: The residents of Kalam here on Saturday demanded of government to take effective measures to repair Kalam ...,"SWAT: The residents of Kalam here on Saturday demanded of government to take effective measures to repair Kalam Road, otherwise they would take to streets in protest.
Led by Hameed Salman, Ejaz Ehsan, Syed Nabi, Akhtar Ali, Munawar, Ameer Gul and Riaz, members of Kalam Action Committee said that recent heavy rains and floods severely damaged the road from Bahrain to Kalam, rendering it impassable at various points.
“The floods, triggered by heavy rainfall, have destroyed sections of Kalam Road, making movement to Kalam very difficult. Only small vehicles and vans are able to navigate the route while large vehicles such as coasters and buses are unable to access it,” they said, adding that the situation affected people and tourists in the area.
They said that despite the deployment of a few excavator machines to clear the sliding debris and rocks, the road was currently only passable one way at a time. It is suitable only for 4x4 vehicles or small cars in good condition, with big vehicles unable to traverse the road. They said that the residents of Kalam relied on tourism and agriculture, both of which necessitated a well-maintained road infrastructure.
A meeting was also held between Kalam Hotel Action Committee and army officials that decided to commence regular restoration work on Kalam Road through National Highway Authority (NHA) on Monday.
The meeting decided that strict measures would be taken against people preading negative information on social media regarding the upcoming project. Major Salman, Subedar Shabbir and their team represented army at the meeting.
Kalam Hotel Action Committee appreciated the army’s efforts for restoring the road amid the recent adverse weather conditions. It pledged to collaborate with authorities to promote tourism in the area.

6,CM Gandapur seeks more support of WFP for uplift of merged districts,Delegation assures govt of more collaborations.,"PESHAWAR: Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has said that provincial government needs more support from World Food Programme and other donor agencies for the development of merged districts.
He said that promoting quality education and creating employment opportunities in merged districts were priority areas of his government, according to a statement issued here on Saturday.
He was talking to a delegation of World Food Programme (WFP), headed by Coco Ushiyama. The delegation called on chief minister and discussed with him matters related to various activities being carried out by WFP in the province, especifically in merged districts.
The head of the delegation and chief minister also discussed the prospects for further expanding the working scope between the provincial government and WFP and agreed to enhance mutual cooperation in various sectors.

Delegation assures govt of more collaborations

Mr Gandapur lauded the cooperation of WFP in various sectors and said that its initiative for providing educational stipends to girls of merged districts was highly commendable. He said that despite financial constraints, the government was not only committed but going all out to bring about positive change in the life of people in merged districts.
“However, we need to have special attention and more concerted efforts to bring those districts into the national mainstream, because the war against terrorism has badly affected the infrastructure in these areas,” said the chief minister.
He said that there was a need to construct farm-to-market roads to accelerate economic activities in the tribal districts. He said that government was planning to build small dams to ensure food security in the province.
The chief minister said introducing other technologies including tunnel farming was also under-consideration to develop agriculture sector on modern lines in addition to establishment of food testing laboratories in the province. He added that it would ensure quality of food commodities in the markets.
“Similarly, we further need to effectively utilise available water resources for producing hydropower and ensuring self-sufficiency in agricultural products. We also need to have foreign investment in order to materialise all these plans,” said Mr Gnadapur. He added that investors would be provided with all kinds of support and facilities.
He said that those efforts would pave way for sustainable development and prosperity by capitalising the untapped advantages and stabilising local economy.
Talking on the occasion, Ms Coco Ushiyama said that WFP was currently working with the provincial government on various public welfare projects including provision of educational stipends to 30,000 girls in merged districts.
“WFP is also willing to further expand its collaboration with the provincial government in various public welfare interventions,” she said.

8,Fisheries officials suspended  over ‘corruption’,Matter to be referred to anti-graft watchdog,"MANSEHRA: The secretary of the livestock and fisheries department on Saturday suspended the deputy director (fisheries), an assistant research officer and a watcher over the alleged embezzlement of funds for Shino Trout Hatchery in Kaghan Valley here.
The development comes following a preliminary inquiry, which found “corruption” of millions of rupees during the procurement of fish seeds, medicines, and feed for the hatchery, which was established for the preservation of one of the tastiest snowy water-borne species in the world, according to sources.
The suspended officials included deputy director (fisheries) Mansehra Fahim Akhtar, assistant research officer Qaisar Javed and watcher of the Shino Trout Hatchery, Kaghan Valley.
The secretary directed them to report to the director-general of the fisheries department with immediate effect and assigned the additional charge of the office of Mansehra’s deputy director (fisheries) to Kohistan deputy director (fisheries) Taj Mohammad, according to a notification.
It also said a committee was formed to “further proceed against the suspended officials and refer the case to a corruption watchdog.”

Matter to be referred to anti-graft watchdog

Sources in the department told Dawn that over Rs24 million funds were embezzled during the purchase of fish seeds, medicines, and feed between June 2023 and December 2023.
Trout can survive in snowy water only and is found in the Kunhar River, which originates in the upper parts of Kaghan Valley. It is sold for Rs3,000-Rs4,000 per kg.
POSTED: Provincial police chief Akhtar Hayat Gandapur has posted Hazara deputy inspector general of police and Upper and Lower Kohistan district police officers.
The three posts had remained vacant since March 26, 2024, following the suspension of the incumbents over the March 26 suicide bombing of a Chinese convoy in the Besham area of Shangla district.
The attack killed five Chinese engineers associated with the Dasu hydropower project in Upper Kohistan, as well as their Pakistani driver.
The provincial police chief posted retired Captain Tahir Ayub as the DIG Hazara, who held the position last year, too, while Mukhtar Ahmad, a senior superintendent of police in the counter-terrorism department in the district, was made the DPO of Upper Kohistan.
Mr Gandapur also appointed Mohammad Umar, the SP (cantonment) in Abbottabad, the DPO of Lower Kohistan.
FINED: The tehsil municipal administration on Saturday fined dozens of traders in Oghi and adjoining areas for profiteering.
The action comes as a team of police, tehsil administration, and the food department, led by assistant commissioner Saleem Khan, paid a surprise visit to local bazaars.
It imposed heavy fines on dozens of shopkeepers, milk sellers, and butchers for violating the notified prices.
The AC said the crackdown on profiteers and hoarders would continue next week.

9,"Man jailed, fined for second marriage without first wife’s nod",PESHAWAR: A local family court on Saturday convicted a man for contracting second marriage without the permission of...,"PESHAWAR: A local family court on Saturday convicted a man for contracting second marriage without the permission of his first wife and local council and sentenced him to three months imprisonment and fined him Rs5,000.
The court presided over by Senior Civil Judge Ghulam Hamid ordered that in case of non-depositing of fine the convict, Sajjad Khan, a resident of Regi Aftezai area of Peshawar, should undergo further simple imprisonment for 15 days.
The judge ruled that the complainant, Ms Fatima, succeeded to prove her case against the accused beyond any shadow of doubt through reliable and confidence inspiring evidence.
The accused was convicted under section 6 (5) of Muslim Family Law Ordinance, 1961, dealing with polygamy and mechanism for contracting second marriage.
The complainant had earlier filed a suit for payment of dower to her in 2019. 
The said suit was already decided and the court had ordered resettlement of the woman with her husband. 
However, the convict had not re-settled her and had already contracted second marriage.
The trial court had also ordered an inquiry through local police wherein it was proved that the convict had contracted second marriage. 
During trial the court had recorded evidence of the inquiry officer, secretary of the relevant union council, complainant and other witnesses.
The lawyer appearing for the complainant contended that the accused contracted the marriage without following the legal requirements provided in Muslim Family Laws Ordinance.
He stated that under section 6 of the ordinance, no man, during the subsistence of an existing marriage, should except with the previous permission in writing of the relevant arbitration council, contract another marriage.
He contended that an application for permission should be submitted to the chairman of the union council in the prescribed manner and should state reasons for the proposed marriage, and whether the consent of existing wife or wives had been obtained thereto.
He argued that contracting second marriage without permission of the local council and consent of the existing wife was a crime under the ordinance. 
The counsel stated that in the earlier suit the accused in his reply had also admitted his contracting of the second marriage.

10,New dengue action plan gets off  the drawing board,"Health dept seeks Rs145m to execute plan, says official","PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department has developed the Dengue Action Plan, 2024, with a focus on the identification and destruction of mosquito larvae and strengthening surveillance and case management in local hospitals to prevent and control the infectious disease.
The plan has been sent to the chief secretary for approval, according to director (public health) at the directorate-general (health services) Dr Irshad Roghani.
He told Dawn that the plan contained measures for checking the production of mosquitoes, the carrier and transmitters of dengue virus, and the building of the capacity of hospital staff members for better case management to ensure that infected patients have access to diagnosis and treatment on time.
“We have demanded Rs145 million to execute the plan,”he said.

Health dept seeks Rs145m to execute plan, says official

The official said in view of the ongoing torrential rains and floods, the department also wanted to further strengthen coordination among the relevant departments to do away with stagnant pools of water to deny mosquitoes breeding spots,” he said.
Dr Roghani said case management was very important, as any laxity on part of health workers could create complications, including deaths.
He said patients would be treated at local hospitals, so the city’s hospitals didn’t get overwhelmed.
“For the first time, we will do stereotyping of the dengue virus to ensure that patients get services along scientific lines. The Public Health Reference Lab at Khyber Medical University is collaborating with the World Health Organisation for the identification of the virus and an effective response,” he said.
The director said a multi-sectoral strategy would be adopted under which efforts, in coordination with the relevant departments, would be made to eliminate stagnant water and other breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
He said the communication and works department would be taken on board to ensure the elimination of water pools near construction sites, while district administrations and tehsil municipal administrations would be involved to prevent the accumulation of water in and outside houses.
“Our women staff members will visit houses and inform the women on how to protect them from dengue through safe water storage and draining of water to avoid pools, while outside the house, our male staff will inform the community regarding the dangers posed by standing water and persuade them to eliminate those pools to prevent the production of mosquitoes,” he said.
Dr Roghani said residents were infected with dengue almost every year as the province was endemic, but during the last two years, the work of health workers against dengue has been excellent.
He said the province recorded 22,000 dengue cases and 18 deaths in 2022, but the number of cases came down to just 747 cases next year.
“We hope the incidence will go down further,” he said.
The director said dengue was “completely” preventable through the elimination of water pools, which the department was ensuring, while training programmes were also arranged for doctors, nurses, and paramedics to manage dengue cases at the local level.
He said awareness was key to dengue prevention, and therefore, the department would spread messages at the community level to inculcate a sense of fear and woo the people towards measures aiming to eliminate breeding points.
“A dengue control room will be established at the offices of the DG (health services) to evaluate activities in districts and intervene if the need arises,” he said.
Dr Roghani said the health department had decided to reserve 1,240 beds for dengue patients in public sector hospitals, including 300 in Peshawar-based health facilities.
“Every medical teaching institution will allocate one ward exclusively for dengue patients,”he said.

A statement issued here said district police officer Umer Khan after receiving reports about illegal mining had ordered a crackdown on the people. The Gumbat police launched an operation and arrested the contractors.
Mr Umer elaborated that any kind of construction and other activities within 700 feet of the riverbank were illegal because it was government property. 
Officials of the mineral department also accompanied the police during the operation led by SHO Gumbat Irfan Afridi.

15,Speakers laud Benazir’s struggle for strengthening democracy,Event held in Swabi to mark launch of book on slain leader’s life,"SWABI: Speakers at an event held here on Saturday paid rich tributes to late Benazir Bhutto for her struggle against anti-democratic forces, for economic emancipation of women and strengthening Pakistan’s position in the comity of nations.
They were speaking at the launching ceremony of a book titled ‘Face To Face With Benazir Bhutto’ written by noted journalist Zahid Hussain.
They said the former prime minister didn’t target her political rivals and always focused on promoting the interests of the country and people’s welfare.
The event was held at the People’s House Rana Dheri, a scenic place on the edge of the Indus River, where PPP leaders and workers gathered to pay rich tribute to their slain leader.
The participants said Benazir lived in the hearts and minds of people in a way no one could.

Event held in Swabi to mark launch of book on slain leader’s life

Bilal Khan Sherpao, a local Pakistan Peoples Party leader, was the chief guest on the occasion.
Mr Bilal said Zahid Hussain’s book was a great contribution to Pakistani society to convey Benazir’s ideas to people.
Nasir Ali Khan, a former diplomat, said as long as he was with Benazir Bhutto, he found her very honest and courageous woman, who loved Pakistan. “She had extraordinary intelligent capability and was matchless,” he said.
“Before she returned to Pakistan, I asked her about the grave security threats to her life, but she said she had no other desire except to serve her beloved country,” said Mr Ali. 
“I have never seen and will never see such a brave leader in Pakistan,” he remarked while lauding the work of the writer for conveying her message to people.
Inger-Mette Stenseth, a Norwegian academician, said various aspects of Benazir’s life had been discussed in the book, helping a reader understand the former prime minister of Pakistan.
“It is a great service for Benazir Bhutto who played an important role in the country’s development,” she said.
Shad Khan, a UK-based journalist, said he came across only a few journalists, who really contributed to the society and Zahid Hussain’s book was a big contribution to Pakistan and its budding democracy. “After reading this book, the reader gets to know how great a person Benazir Bhutto was and where she wanted to take Pakistan,” he added.
Speaking on occasion, Zahid Hussain said he first interviewed Benazir Bhutto when she was 32 and even at that time he found her approach highly mature because she passed through the worst period of Gen Zia’s dictatorship, during which, his father Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was sent to gallows.
He said after various encounters with Benazir Bhutto, he concluded that she was a brave leader, had tolerance and believed in democracy and never wanted to target her opponents, and considered democracy as the best revenge.

17,Opposition leader requests PA speaker to call session for oath-taking,Govt says it has no objections to PHC’s orders for sitting,"PESHAWAR: Opposition leader in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Dr Ibadullah Khan has formally requested Speaker of the provincial legislature Babar Saleem Swati to call a sitting of the house for the swearing-in of the members elected to the seats reserved for women and non-Muslims.
In a letter, the opposition leader urged the speaker to take “necessary action” for calling the session to implement the orders of the Peshawar High Court.
As the provincial government refused to call the sitting, the opposition moved the high court, which has directed the provincial chief minister and cabinet to convene the assembly’s sitting within a fortnight to ensure that those elected on reserved seats take oath.
The orders were issued by a division bench comprising Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Shakeel Ahmad on Friday in a detailed judgement on three identical petitions filed by around 20 MPAs-elect of the opposition.

Govt says it has no objections to PHC’s orders for sitting

The bench also directed the speaker to administer oaths to those lawmakers in the session to be requisitioned in accordance with its orders.
In its March 27 short order, it didn’t issue such orders to the CM and the provincial cabinet.
However, the detailed judgement declared that both the CM and the cabinet should “take all material steps in terms of Article 109 along with all enabling provisions of the Constitution for summoning the session of the provincial assembly within a fortnight positively, after receipt of this judgement, so that the oath is administered to the petitioners in terms of Article 65 of the Constitution before the Senate election.”
When contacted, spokesman for the provincial government Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said the government had “no objections” to the court’s orders.
He, however, said it was the prerogative of the assembly’s speaker to “formulate the agenda for the session and call it.
Mr Saif also told Dawn that under Article 69 of the Constitution, it was beyond the mandate of the judiciary to call a sitting of the provincial legislature.
Last month, provincial Governor Ghulam Ali called an assembly session on March 22 for the swearing-in of members elected to the reserved and minority seats and notified by the Election Commission of Pakistan on March 4.
The move caused a tiff between the governor and the newly-elected government, which declared it against the rules as well as the Constitution.
The office of Speaker Babar Saleem Swati also sought the opinion of the law department about whether the governor’s order in question was in line with the Constitution.
The government’s refusal to call the sitting on March 22 led to a protest by opposition members, who alleged that the government wanted to deprive the members elected to reserved seats of the right to cast votes in the Senate polls.
Opposition leader Dr Ibadullah Khan of the PML-N insisted that the government’s move to block the swearing-in of members was meant to “claim four extra seats” in the Senate polls.
