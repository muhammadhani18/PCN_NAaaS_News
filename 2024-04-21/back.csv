4,Govt’s Rs4.23tr stuck in court tax cases,Billions held up due to appeal stage delays,"Currently, there are 145,036 cases pending in various courts, in which tax cases involving an amount of Rs 4.23 trillion are yet to be decided.
Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) officials said at present 19,528 cases involving Rs740 billion were pending in four high courts.
They added that the Supreme Court had yet to decide 3,455 tax-related cases involving a sum of Rs1.40 trillion. A sum of Rs2.23 trillion belonging to the federal government is stuck because of tax disputes.
In addition, the government is also considering introducing legislation to abolish the offices of the FBR’s Inland Revenue appeal commissioner where cases involving an amount of Rs1.15 trillion were hit by delays.
Billions of rupees of the government have been grounded because of the delay in tax cases at the appeal stage.
Therefore, the government has started reviewing the proposal to do away with the offices of the Inland Revenue Appeal Commissioner through legislation.
According to sources, 19,899 cases in 35 offices are pending in the appeal stage because of which a sum of Rs1.15 trillion is stuck.
This situation has forced the government to review the proposal to shut down 30 of the Inland Revenue Appeal Commissioner's offices.
Legislation will soon be passed by parliament to close down these offices.
The sources said after the offices of the Inland Revenue appeal commissioner were shut down, their cases would be transferred to the tribunal where 71,664 cases of Rs2.23 trillion in tax disputes were already pending.
Currently, 145,036 cases are pending in various courts, in which tax cases involving an amount of Rs4.23 trillion are yet to be decided.
An officer of the Inland Revenue Service (commonly at BPS-19 or BPS-20) is appointed to the office of the commissioner (appeals). The commissioner (appeals) is a designated authority under federal tax laws and inevitably comes under the administrative control of the FBR.
Federal tax laws provide that any taxpayer aggrieved by an order passed by an Inland Revenue officer may appeal to the commissioner (appeals) through a prescribed form along with payment of the prescribed fee within 30 days.
The commissioner (appeals) may, on the application of the appellant in writing, condone a delay in the late filing of an appeal. They also issue notices of hearing to the appellant as well as the concerned Inland Revenue officer before deciding the appeal.
The laws empower the commissioner (appeals) to stay the recovery of tax demanded for a maximum period of 60 days in income tax appeals and 30 days in those related to sales tax and federal excise.

5,CJ Isa worried about wasteful GOR security,"SC registrar directs Punjab chief secretary to provide applicable rules, regulations","Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa has expressed concern about wasting public money on the construction of unnecessary walls and other structures for augmenting the security of already well-secured Government Officers Residences (GOR) in Lahore.
In a letter addressed to the Punjab chief secretary, the SC registrar on Saturday that CJ Isa during his stay at a rest house in Lahore’s GOR from April 15 and April 19 noted that “the character of the GOR has changed, and continues to change, for the worse”.
The letter asked the chief secretary as to why rooms for security guards have been “illegally” constructed on open, green areas in the GOR despite the fact that entry into the residences is restricted, and gained after security checks.
“If a guard is required, he should be [accommodated] within the premises of the residence of the person to be guarded,” it said, adding that unnecessary and wasteful expenditure on walls constructed around each residence within the GOR also concerned the CJ.
“Is it justifiable to spend public resources on walls within the secured GOR? And, why has the earlier practice of installing fences been discarded?” it asked. The letter instructed the chief secretary to provide the applicable rules and regulations in respect of buildings and construction, including walls, within the GOR.
CJ Qazi Faez Isa stayed in Lahore from April 15 to 19 and led a bench to hear various cases at the Supreme Court’s Lahore Registry.
Justice Isa will hear various civil and criminal cases at the Supreme Court’s Karachi registry for five days—from April 22 to April 26. The CJ will head a three-member bench also comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan.

6,S Arabia moves closer to $1b Reko Diq deal,"May reach preliminary agreement in next few week, reports Bloomberg","Saudi Arabia is moving closer to a potential deal to acquire a minority stake in a Pakistan mine controlled by Barrick Gold Corp, Bloomberg said in a recent report.
Citing sources, the publication said Manara Minerals Investment Co, backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, plans to invest at least $1 billion in the Reko Diq copper and gold mining project and can announce that it has reached a preliminary agreement on terms of a transaction in the next few weeks.
The Saudi company may increase its investment over time in the mine, which is part-owned by the Pakistan government. Deliberations are ongoing, and talks could still fall apart or be delayed.
Saudi Arabia is interested to invest in multiple sectors including metals and mining, Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said in an interview Wednesday. A few “of those projects are now pretty close, so I do think we should hear some announcements coming through,” Aurangzeb said.
Pakistan presented a wide range of investment opportunities including solar, mining, hydropower and technology to a visiting Saudi delegation this week, with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan saying the Gulf kingdom plans to move ahead with the opportunities.
The Reko Diq project located in Chagai district of Balochistan is targeted to begin production in 2028. Barrick owns 50% of the project, with Pakistan’s federal government holding a 25% stake and the Balochistan regional government owning the rest.
Saudi Arabia has been in talks with Pakistan to buy part of the government’s stake in Reko Diq, Barrick Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said in a November interview.
The world’s second-largest gold producer would support any decision by the government with the Saudis, while Barrick won’t dilute its equity in the project, Bristow said, according to the report.

7,Railways starts new fuel management system,Baloch said this initiative was currently being kicked off in Karachi and Lahore,"The Pakistan Railways has started its fuel management system, it was announced on Friday.
PR CEO Amir Ali Baloch said a new agreement had been made with the Pakistan State Oil (PSO), which would now be responsible for ensuring a consistent fuel feed to the railway’s oil supply facilities.
“The PSO has the latest fuel management technology, which will now benefit the railway’s operation,” he added.
The PR CEO said the railway’s fuel supply centres are set to undergo upgrades to meet the international benchmarks in line with the standards set by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
“Under the agreement, the railway’s fuel supply centres will not only be insured according to global standards but will also witness the installation of the world's top firefighting systems.”
Baloch said this initiative was currently being kicked off in Karachi and Lahore. He continued that there were plans to extend the system to six additional cities soon.
The CEO pointed out that the system would potentially help in conserving railway’s resources and minimise fuel wastage.
He further emphasised the system's capability to significantly reduce the likelihood of fuel theft.

8,PAC chief slot widens PTI-JUI-F gap,Maulana-led party floats name of Noor Alam Khan for post,"The opposition is divided over the position of the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee as after PTI’s Sher Afzal Marwat, JUI-F’s Noor Alam Khan has also joined the race for the slot.
The ruling alliance seems to be throwing its weight behind the JUI-F contender for the race.
The appointment of the PAC chief after the National Assembly leader of the opposition has opened a new Pandora's Box.
After Marwat’s nomination for the PAC chairman position by PTI founding chairman Imran Khan, the name of JUI-F’s Noor Alam Khan also started circulating for the slot on the opposition’s side.
According to sources, Noor has started back doors contacts for the PAC chief’s slot, while the ruling alliance parties are also leaning towards him instead of giving the chairmanship of the important committee to a PTI nominee.
The PAC of parliament will comprise 10 members each from the National Assembly and Senate.
According to the NA rules, the chairpersonship of the PAC is supposed to be with the opposition.
However, there is a possibility that the number of government members in the PAC will increase because of their two-thirds majority in the parliament.
It is because of this reason that Noor’s chances are brighter than Marwat to clinch the PAC top slot as the government members are likely to vote for the JUI-F candidate rather than the PTI leader.
According to the sources, after the formation of the PAC, its chairperson will be elected. However, both the government and opposition have not yet presented any names for the members of any parliamentary committee including the PAC.
Seeds of discord were sown between the PTI and JUI-F recently after slogans were shouted against the latter’s chief, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, in the six-party opposition alliance’s first rally in Pishin town of Balochistan against the ruling parties over the alleged “theft of mandate”.
Both the PTI and JUI-F have remained at loggerheads with one another for a long time.
Imran and other party leaders would call the JUI-F chief “diesel” in rallies and media interactions, referring to an accusation that Fazl had purportedly benefitted financially by receiving fuel permits during the PPP government in the 1990s.
The thaw in relations between the two bitter political arch-rivals was seen when both sides finally sat together to discuss the situation in the country and initiate dialogue with other political forces in October last year.
The first formal contact between the two sides came after Imran gave his nod to proceed with the move.
It was seen as a major political U-turn by the PTI to lower tensions between the two sides when its leaders visited the JUI-F chief’s residence.
Following the meeting, PTI leaders including Asad Qaiser, Ali Muhammad Khan, and Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, even offered prayers behind Fazl -- that too keeping in view the sentiments that their party and its leadership had for him.
Before and after the elections, both sides have held several meetings and were seen coming closer to each other as well as mulling to start a joint movement against the government over what they called “massive rigging” in the general elections.
However, on the day of their first rally, the JUI-F accused PTI’s Marwat of insulting the Maulana, demanding that party must control its leaders.
During the rally, Marwat was seen asking people not to chant the slogan of “diesel” as talks were still under way with the JUI-F.
While accusing the PTI of having double standards, a JUI-F spokesperson said that its “hypocrisy” had come to the fore at the opposition parties’ first rally.
