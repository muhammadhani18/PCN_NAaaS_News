0,JUI-F to up the ante against ‘fake govt’: Fazlur Rehman,Says politicians shouldn’t put themselves up for sale for seats.,"QUETTA: JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman once again “rejected” the February 8 general elections, vowing that his party will not let the existing government function as it was “fake” and a product of rigged polls.
Addressing a public meeting at the Taj Lala Stadium in Pishin on Saturday, he said: “Our anti-government movement will spread across the country, and nobody can stop it.”
The gathering, scheduled to start at 10am, was delayed by over five hours as Mr Rehman and other JUI-F leaders arrived late.
 
 

Heavy security deployment was made around the venue as the district administration had issued a threat alert three days back over reports of a possible attack on the public meeting.

Says politicians shouldn’t put themselves up for sale for seats

In his address, the JUI-F emir termed the Feb 8 elections “more rigged than 2018”. “We were on the front against the 2018 assemblies and also will be at the front against this rigged election.”
‘Up for sale’
The JUI-F emir said the establishment always used politicians and political parties to safeguard its interests, but now was the time to “unite against the system through which people’s mandate was stolen”.
“It is not the time to fight against each other, and politicians should not put themselves up for sale just for an assembly seat,” he said, regretting that any candidate who fails to win terms the election rigged, and those who do get a seat deem it fair.
 
 

Mr Rehman said the people of Balochistan have already rejected the results of the Feb 8 elections and were protesting against those “responsible for the rigging”. He announced that his party will boycott the by-election in the PB-50 constituency scheduled for today (Sunday).
The Maulana said the army had “no role in the creation of Pakistan”, and it was the result of a movement launched with the support of people. He said there was no democracy in the country, and due to wrong policies, the economy had “reached the brink of disaster”.
The JUI-F chief criticised the Muslim world on the issue of Palestine and the genocide of innocent Palestinians in Gaza.
Maulana Ghafoor Haideri, Maulana Mehmood Shah and other party leaders also spoke at the public meeting.

1,Two more sewage samples test positive for wild poliovirus,Disease belongs to genetic cluster prevalent in Afghanistan.,"ISLAMABAD: Two sewage samples collected from Quetta and Karachi have tested positive for the presence of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1).
According to the Regional Reference Lab for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health, the samples were genetically linked to the imported YB3A cluster of virus prevalent in Afghanistan.
The cluster was eradicated from Pakistan in 2021, but remained in circulation in the neighbouring country and reintroduced through cross-border transmission in January 2023.
The environmental sample in Karachi was collected from Keamari district.
According to authorities, environmental samples collected from 31 districts have tested positive so far, with all of them containing the YB3A poliovirus genetic cluster. 

Disease belongs to genetic cluster prevalent in Afghanistan

The two polio cases of 2024 were also genetically linked to the same cluster.
Meanwhile, the Natio­nal Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) for Polio Eradication organised a briefing for the donors and partner organisations supporting the Pakistan Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI).
They were apprised of the progress in polio eradication efforts.
The Prime Minister’s coordinator on National Health Services, Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Bharath; Federal Health Secretary Nadeem Mehbub; representatives of WHO, Unicef and Rotary Foundation; Pakistan National Polio Plus Committee Chairman Aziz Memon; and officials of donor agencies attended the briefing.
In his address, Dr Bharath said that Pakistan was committed to fulfilling its obligations under global public health and eradicating polio.
Highlighting the progress of polio eradication efforts, he said: “With the support of our valued partners and donors, we are running the largest polio eradication programme in the world, backed by an extensive poliovirus surveillance network and modern lab.”
However, he added that Pakistan “continues to detect cases” indicating the need for more work to be done.
“The strong commitment and dedication of our partner agencies and donors has been crucial in bringing us this close to polio eradication. I hope that this support continues as Pakistan positions itself to interrupt poliovirus transmission this year,” he added.
In his address, Health Secretary Mehbub said that the ministry was providing its full support to the polio eradication programme “to reach every child with the vaccine”.
