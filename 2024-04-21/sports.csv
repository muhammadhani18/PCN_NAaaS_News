0,Sleuths’ performance goes downhill,Poor challan ratio exposes tall claims of Rawalpindi police,"The investigation wing of the Rawalpindi district police performed below average in the first quarter (Jan 1 to March 31) of the year 2004, official statistics available to The Express Tribune reveal. The performance of 30 police stations depicts a disappointing picture in terms of submission of complete challans in cases.
The SSP Investigation and his team ‘failed’ to meet the deadline for submitting the challans to the courts after the investigations. During this quarter, as many as 10,819 cases were registered at all police stations, however, only 595 cases were presented as final complete challans in courts. Within the constitutional period of 14 days, the complete challan could not be submitted in 10,224 cases.
However, the investigation wing teams later submitted 1,549 incomplete interim challans. Throughout the period, as many as 41 cases were registered, but the police failed to trace them. Furthermore, 127 FIRs were dismissed as fake. A total of 76 cases of murder, 839 cases of robbery, and 2,732 cases of theft and lock breaking were registered during the period.
As many as 269 cases of abduction of women for rape, 116 of fraud, 21 of rape of women and children, 14 cases of terrorism, 139 of attempted murders, 435 of weapons recovery, 341 of narcotics, 49 of traffic accidents, and 269 cases of border violations were registered. The police were only able to submit full challans in cases of drug, alcohol, gambling, arms recovery, and traffic accidents.
On the other hand, the investigation teams' performance in submitting complete challans for major cases such as car theft, murder, and kidnapping for rape has been quite unsatisfactory. Due to delays in presenting challans for heinous cases, the accused managed to escape after securing bails from the courts. It’s common practice that the accused of serious cases usually take advantage of the delays in the challan submission process.
According to senior lawyers Sabatin Bukhari, Shanzeb Khan, and GM Shah, the emergence of new methods and trends in crimes and quickness in committing crimes has created the need to extend the period for submitting a full challan in a case to 40 days. It’s also essential to establish forensic lab test facilities at divisional locations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.
They are of of view that the investigation officers should be segregated within police stations and night patrolling and duties shouldn’t be assigned to these officers so that they could solely focus on the investigation work. These measures would enhance the effectiveness and vitality of investigations, ultimately leading to an increase in conviction rates.
A senior IO says that the challan submission could improve if the investigation wing officials are spared from crackdowns against the workers of a political party and the daily duties of monitoring political leaders and workers. Additionally, he adds that it’s vital to ensure that the IOs receive timely and complete payment for their investigation costs as they do not have the expense of transporting the accused from the police stations to the Adiala Jail. The official says that the IOs are left with no choice but to recover the expenses from the plaintiff and the accused’s parties. According to the official, stationery for the investigation is procured from the relatives of the accused.
When contacted, a police spokesman claims that the challan ratio of the investigation police has witnessed improvement this year.

1,Two girls gunned down in twin cities,Assailants throw victim’s body from moving car in federal capital,"In two separate incidents of homicide in the twin cities, two women were shot dead by unknown suspects on Saturday.
In the first incident, a 23-year-old woman was shot dead during a dance party in Rawalpindi.
According to a spokesperson for the police, the incident occurred at a four-storey flat situated in a sensitive area within the Airport police station’s jurisdiction.
He said a gathering involving drinking and dancing had been ongoing at flat no 418, block A of a local private society, owned by a man named Saqib. Witnesses from the neighbourhood told the police that the party lasted late into the night between Friday and Saturday.
However, matters took a grim turn in the early morning hours when a youth, identified as Waqar, fired the fatal shot that led to Heeta Khan's demise.
Following the distressing event, an elderly neighbour promptly alerted Rescue 1122, prompting a response from the Airport police and Rescue 1122 teams. Heeta Khan's body was then transported to the Rawalpindi District Headquarters Hospital for medico-legal procedures before being handed over to her family. Subsequently, the police registered a case, although both Saqib and the suspect Waqar, along with their associates, fled the scene.
A spokesperson for the police said the Airport police have gathered substantial evidence, including CCTV footage from the vicinity. While details are limited at this stage, authorities assure that all suspects involved will be apprehended and face legal consequences.
In response to the incident, SSP operations ordered the prompt arrest of the accused and detained four individuals, with legal proceedings initiated against those involved. SSP Operations emphasised that vigilant enforcement of the law will be maintained.
In the second incident, another young girl was tragically shot and killed in the federal capital's Industrial police station area. According to sources, her body was subsequently thrown from a moving car. The police shifted the victim's body to the hospital for medico-legal examination. Preliminary investigations suggest that an unidentified assailant fatally shot the girl. Efforts are underway to identify the victim, with the police actively pursuing leads and analysing CCTV footage obtained from the crime scene.
Eyewitnesses reported that the girl was shot inside a car before being discarded from it. Her fingerprints have been collected to aid in her identification through NADRA.

2,Inquiry ordered against police high-handedness,"Cantt police detain ‘suspects’ out of jurisdiction, demand money for release","Taking serious notice of minting money from the heirs of some alleged criminals, the Punjab police chief has ordered the Internal Accountability Division (IAD) of the department to hold a departmental inquiry against the officials of three Rawalpindi police stations.
The inquiry was ordered after it came to the notice of the police authorities that the Cantonment police allegedly picked some ‘criminals’ involved in incidents of robbery and theft from a hotel situated in the ambit of the Priwadhai police station, bargained with their families and upon being exposed handed over the accused to the police concerned in mutual connivance.
A high-level inquiry team led by Faisalabad IAD SSP Rana Arshad is conducting an inquiry involving the SHOs and other staff of the Cantt, Westridge and Pirwadhai police stations.
A senior police officer, who wished not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media, told The Express Tribune the IGP was informed that Cantt police raided the hotel in Pirwadhai police limits without bringing the matter to the notice of the concerned police authorities, took four suspects into custody and shifted them to their police station.
The families of the suspects reached the hotel in search and found them taken away by some cops representing the Cantt police with the help of the CCTV footage. They contacted Cantt SHO SI Hasnain who said that the accused are involved in thefts and crimes. After some time the police contacted the relatives of the detained suspects and demanded money for their release. An audio recording clip also came to surface regarding the conversation.
When the matter was made public and no case was detected at the Cantt police station, the police immediately handed over the suspects to the Westridge police overnight. Keeping in view the sensitivity of the situation, the Westridge police formally arrested the accused the next day and sent them to jail for an identification parade.
According to the senior officer, the matter came to the notice of Rawalpindi City Police Officer Khalid Hamdani and SSP Operations Hafiz Kamran Asghar who suspended the Cantt SHO after conducting a preliminary inquiry and issued him a charge sheet.
The inquiry team recorded the statements of the SHOs and other officials of three police stations and other concerned persons. The identification parade of the accused in the cases of the Westridge police station has also been completed. A detailed report will be prepared after all statements and will be sent to the IGP through the office of the Additional IG IAD Punjab.

3,Axe falls on 3 fisheries dept officials,Officers found guilty of embezzling funds at Pakistan's oldest trout hatchery,"A significant case of embezzlement has come to light in the procurement of fish and fish feed at Pakistan’s oldest Trout hatchery in the Kaghan Valley.
Once the inquiry confirmed the allegations, the K-P Secretary of the Livestock and Fisheries Department initiated further action by suspending the deputy director, research officer, and a watcher implicated in the case.
Recently, farmers engaged in the Trout farming business in Kaghan Valley have suffered significant financial losses of millions as a result of a disease outbreak. Sources said to add to their troubles, officials have been involved in embezzlement activities instead of carrying out their duties diligently. The oldest hatchery in Pakistan is also standing on the verge of destruction due to a lack of interest.
As per reliable sources, officers from the district fisheries department were involved in large-scale embezzlement of funds through the purchase of fish, feed and chemicals at the trout hatchery.
As per the statement released by the Secretary Livestock, the inquiry report conducted by the inquiry officer, Deputy Director Fisheries Faheem Khan, Research Officer Qaiser Javed and Watcher Javed Haroon have been found guilty of corruption. The three have been directed to report to the Deputy Director's Office.
Notably, extensive fish farming has been practised in the Kaghan Valley for the past several years. Unfortunately, after a few years, an unknown disease began to plague the trout fish population, resulting in substantial suffering for the farmers.
The authorities were found to be involved in embezzlement rather than doing their job by implementing measures to control the disease. Farmers are urging the chief minister of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to take action.

4,Authority destroys 200 kgs of unhealthy meat,"Seals food manufacturing unit, impounds machinery","The Food Control Cell of the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board took action against food safety violations and destroyed 200 kgs of substandard meat and sealed a manufacturing unit involved in producing low-quality ketchup on Saturday.
The crackdown, conducted in areas like Dhok Syedan, Misaryal Road, Hasnain Street, and Tench Bhatta, targeted the illicit sale of unhygienic meat, sourced from unauthorised slaughterhouses lacking official approval seals. The food control cell's staff confiscated and incinerated 200 kilograms of subpar mutton and beef in a public display, simultaneously issuing hefty fines and challans to offending butchers.
Additionally, a significant quantity of tomato ketchup from a substandard and counterfeit factory was seized in the Sadar Coal Centre area of Rawalpindi. Alongside the confiscation of ketchup, the equipment used in its production was impounded, and the dubious factory responsible for the inferior product was promptly shut down.
The enforcement action extended to private markets where food items were being sold without adherence to hygiene regulations, including missing date menus and expiry labels. Such non-compliant items were seized and disposed of on a large scale.
In response to these violations, Cantonment Executive Officer Syed Ali Irfan Rizvi issued strict directives to the food control cell, emphasising a zero-tolerance policy toward unhygienic food sales within the Cantt area. Those found flouting hygiene laws and peddling unhealthy foodstuffs face severe penalties, including imprisonment and substantial fines. These measures aim to deter price-gouging practices and ensure public safety.
Furthermore, the food control cell has instructed meat vendors not to trade in sick or unfit animals, underscoring the board's commitment to upholding food quality standards. Multiple teams under the cell's purview continued inspections and sampling procedures, submitting samples to the Cantt laboratory for evaluation. Any deviations from quality norms, whether substandard or compliant, will result in appropriate legal actions against the responsible parties, reinforcing the cantonment board's dedication to curbing the production and sale of unsafe food products, officials said.
