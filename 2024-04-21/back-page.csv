0,Army deployed for by-election security,"All set for polling for 21 National Assembly, provincial seats today; cellular internet services to go out in Punjab for ‘law and order’ reasons.","ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: As 21 national and provincial seats go to by-polls today (Sunday), the interior ministry has allowed the suspension of mobile internet services to “maintain law and order” in 13 districts and tehsils in Punjab — on the recommendations of the provincial government — as well as approved the deployment of the army as the quick response force.
The Punjab home department had on Friday written a letter to the interior ministry stating that the by-elections had been scheduled for April 21 (Sunday) in Punjab’s four districts and nine tehsils and there was a need to suspend the mobile internet services to maintain law and order and avoid any untoward incident.
 
 

The home department sought the suspension of mobile internet services in  Gujrat, Kasur, Sheikhupura and Lahore districts as well as in Talagang,  Chakwal, Kallar Kahar, Ali Pur Chatha, Zafarwal, Bhakkar City,  Sadiqabad, Kot Chutta and Dera Ghazi Khan City tehsils.
Sources in the home department said the Pakistan Telecommunication Aut­hority would surely suspend mobile internet services to maintain law and order.

Army troops as QRF
The interior ministry also decided to deploy the army and civil armed forces at a request made by the Election Comm­ission of Pakistan (ECP) almost two weeks ago.
As per an order issued by the interior ministry, under articles 220  and 245 of the Constitution and sections 4 and 5 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, the government would use the armed forces as a quick response force.
It stated that the civil armed forces and the Pakistan Army units would be used as second and third tiers of security and would be available till April 22.
“The exact number of troops, date/period, area and mode of deployment would be worked out by the ECP in consultation with all concerned stakeholders based on ground requirement/assessment,” the order read.
A PTI spokesman said the electoral rules and regulations were being flouted as was the case during the general elections, besides victimising the party leaders, workers and supporters.
‘Unconstitutional and illegal’
The PTI, however, termed the move as a preparation to steal the by-elections. Its spokesperson said the suspension of internet services in districts and tehsils, where by-election had been scheduled for Sunday, was not only unconstitutional and illegal, but also a move “to steal the elections”.
 
 

Reacting to the Punjab government’s move, the PTI’s central media department has alleged that the establishment was preparing to steal the by-elections through an “unholy alliance” of the Election Commission of Pakistan, and ‘unelected’ governments at the Centre and in Punjab.
According to a code of conduct issued by the ECP, the armed forces and civil armed forces will ensure a secure and peaceful environment during the by-elections. The security forces will ensure a secure environment for easy access of voters to the polling stations, wherein the police will be first-tier responders while the “civil armed forces/armed forces as second- and third-tier responders, respectively”.
The troops would provide security to enable district returning officers (DROs), returning officers (ROs), presiding officers (POs) and polling staff in the accomplishment of their assigned tasks. .
“In case, the presiding officer does not act to prevent the commission of any reported irregularity/issue /malpractice, the security staff will immediately inform the returning officer concerned.”
It read, “[They will] not disallow any eligible voter to enter the polling station, except the ones found in possession of weapon or explosive or undesirable items or ones who create disturbance and incitement to act of violence or an action which are prejudice to national safety/interests of Pakistan.”
The troops cannot assume the duties of polling staff. “Not take into his/her custody any electoral material including ballot papers marking aid stamps, official code mark stamps, electoral rolls, ballot boxes Form-45 and Form-46 etc,” it added.

1,"US House okays aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan","The Senate is expected to pass the measure next week, sending it to Biden to sign into law.","WASHINGTON: The US House of Represe­ntatives on Saturday with broad bipartisan support passed a $95 billion legislative package providing security assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, over bitter objections from Republican hardliners.
The legislation now proceeds to the Democratic-majority Senate, which passed a similar measure more than two months ago. US leaders from Democ­ratic President Joe Biden to top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell have been urging embattled Republican House Spea­ker Mike Johnson to bring it up for a vote.
 
 

The Senate is expected to pass the measure next week, sending it to Biden to sign into law.
The measure includes some $60.84bn for Ukraine as it struggles to fight off Russian invasion. The unusual four-bill package also includes funds for Israel, security assistance for Taiwan.
“The world is watching what the Congress does,” the White House said in a statement on Friday. “Passing this legislation would send a powerful message about the strength of American leadership at a pivotal moment. The administration urges both chambers of the Congress to quickly send this supplemental funding package to the president’s desk.”
Some hardline Republicans have voiced strong opposition to further Ukraine aid, with some arguing the US can ill afford it given its rising $34 trillion national debt.
“It’s not the perfect legislation, it’s not the legislation that we would write if Republicans were in charge of both the House, the Senate, and the White House,” Johnson told reporters on Friday.
Representative Bob Good, chair of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, told reporters on Friday that the bills represent a “slide down into the abyss of greater fiscal crisis”.

2,Israeli strike leaves 9 members of a family dead in Rafah,10 killed in West Bank attack; Erdogan urges Palestinian unity after meeting Hamas chief.,"RAFAH: Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Saturday an overnight Israeli strike killed nine members of a Palestinian family, including six children, in the southern city Rafah.
Separately, Israeli troops killed 10 people in the occupied West Bank.
Five children aged one to seven and a 16-year-old girl were among the dead, along with two women and a man, according to the city’s Al Najjar hospital.
“Nine martyrs including six children were pulled out from the rubble after Israeli air forces struck a house of the Radwan family in Tal al-Sultan in Rafah,” Gaza Civil Defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said in a statement.
Outside the hospital an AFP journalist saw people grieving over small body bags. A woman stroked a dead boy’s forehead as planes rumbled overhead.

10 killed in West Bank attack; Erdogan urges Palestinian unity after meeting Hamas chief

“People were sleeping peacefully,” said neighbour Abu Mohammed Ziyadah.
“As you can see, there were no militants, not even male adults, except for the head of the family. They were all women and children.”
The Israeli army killed 10 Palestinians in an ongoing raid around Nur Shams, a refugee camp in the north of the occupied West Bank.
Journalists heard gunshots and saw houses hit by blasts as Israeli drones flew overhead and armoured vehicles moved through the camp.
The Israeli army said that over more than 40 hours it had eliminated 10 fighters and made eight arrests around Nur Shams. It said eight soldiers and a police officer were wounded.
The Palestinian health ministry said it had confirmed 11 wounded in the Israeli raid, seven of them “wounded by live gunshots”. It said a paramedic shot while trying to get to the wounded was among them.
Erdogan-Haniyeh meeting
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged Palestinians to unite amid Israel’s war in Gaza following hours-long talks with Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Istanbul on Saturday, his office said.
Erdogan said Palestinian unity was “vital” following the talks at the Dolmabahce palace on the banks of the Bosphorus strait, which Turkish media reports said lasted more than two and a half hours.
“The strongest response to Israel and the path to victory lie in unity and integrity,” Erdogan said, according to a Turkish presidency statement.
As fears of a wider regional war grow, Erdogan said recent events between Iran and Israel should not allow Israel to “gain ground and that it is important to act in a way that keeps attention on Gaza”.
With Qatar saying it will reassess its role as a mediator between Hamas and Israel, Erdogan sent Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan to Doha on Wednesday in a new sign that he wants a role.
“Even if only I, Tayyip Erdogan, remain, I will continue as long as God gives me my life, to defend the Palestinian struggle and to be the voice of the oppressed Palestinian people,” the president said on Wednesday when he announced Haniyeh’s visit.
Fidan on Saturday held talks with visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, with both men emphasising the need to deliver more humanitarian aid to devastated Gaza where the threat of famine looms.
Turkey is one of Gaza’s main humanitarian aid partners, sending 45,000 tonnes of supplies and medicine in the region.
Last year, Erdogan likened the tactics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to those of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and called Israel a “terrorist state” because of its offensive against Hamas after the group’s October 7 attacks on Israel.

3,Dubai carriers resume normal operations after floods,RIYADH: Dubai’s flagship carrier Emirates and sister airline flydubai have restored normal operations after heavy...,"RIYADH: Dubai’s flagship carrier Emirates and sister airline flydubai have restored normal operations after heavy rains caused severe flooding across the United Arab Emirates earlier this week, the airlines said on Saturday. 
Emirates cancelled nearly 400 flights and delayed many more as a result of a record storm that hit the desert city of Dubai on Tuesday, said a statement released by the airline’s president, Tim Clark. 
Due to the impact of the storm, the airline suspended check-in for passengers departing from Dubai and halted its transit operations through Dubai International Airport, a major global travel hub, leaving thousands of travellers stranded. 
The airport has struggled to return to normal operations after the storm flooded taxiways, forcing flight diversions, delays and cancellations. 
Flydubai also returned to its full flight schedule from the airport’s Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 on Saturday following the weather-related disruption, a spokesperson for the airline said. 
Clark said Emirates had provided 12,000 hotel rooms and 250,000 meal vouchers to customers who were affected. He added it would take days to clear the backlog of rebooked passengers. 
The UAE has suffered the impact of the flooding for days, with roads between the city and Abu Dhabi still partially under water as of Saturday. In Abu Dhabi, some supermarkets and restaurants faced product shortages, unable to receive deliveries from Dubai. 
Researchers have linked extreme weather events such as Tuesday’s storm to climate change and anticipate that global warming will lead to higher temperatures, increased humidity and a greater risk of flooding in parts of the Gulf region. 
A lack of drainage infrastructure to cope with heavy rains in countries such as the UAE can put them at particular risk of flooding.

4,‘Adopt or miss train’: Artificial Intelligence’s relentless rise gives journalists tough choices,Media professionals agree that their trade must now focus on tasks offering the greatest “added value”.,"PERUGIA: The rise of artificial intelligence has forced an increasing number of journalists to grapple with the ethical and editorial challenges posed by the rapidly expanding technology.
AI’s role in assisting newsrooms or transforming them completely was among the questions raised at the International Journalism Festival in the Italian city of Perugia that closes on Sunday.
What will happen to jobs?
AI tools imitating human intelligence are widely used in newsrooms around the world to transcribe sound files, summarise texts and translate.
In early 2023, Germany’s Axel Springer group announced it was cutting jobs at the Bild and Die Welt newspapers, saying AI could now “replace” some of its journalists.
Generative AI — capable of producing text and images following a simple request in everyday language — has been opening new frontiers as well as raising concerns for a year and a half.
One issue is that voices and faces can now be cloned to produce a podcast or present news on television. Last year, Filipino website Rappler created a brand aimed at young audiences by converting its long articles into comics, graphics and even videos.
Media professionals agree that their trade must now focus on tasks offering the greatest “added value”.
“You’re the one who is doing the real stuff” and “the tools that we produce will be an assistant to you,” Google News general manager Shailesh Prakash told the festival in Perugia.
The costs of generative AI have plummeted since ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022, with the tool designed by US start-up OpenAI now accessible to smaller newsrooms.
Colombian investigative outlet Cuestion Publica has harnessed engineers to develop a tool that can delve into its archives and find relevant background information in the event of breaking news.
But many media organisations are not making their own language models, which are at the core of AI interfaces, said University of Amsterdam professor Natali Helberger.
The disinformation threat
According to one estimate last year by Everypixel Journal, AI has created as many images in one year as photography in 150 years.
That has raised serious questions about how news can be fished out of the tidal wave of content, including deepfakes.
Media and tech organisations are teaming up to tackle the threat, notably through the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, which seeks to set common standards.
From Wild West to regulation
Media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which has expanded its media rights brief to defending trustworthy news, launched the Paris Charter on AI and journalism late last year.
“One of the things I really liked about the Paris Charter was the emphasis on transparency,” said Anya Schiffrin, a lecturer on global media, innovation and human rights at Columbia University in the United States.
AI editorial guidelines are updated every three months at India’s Quintillion Media, said its boss Ritu Kapur. None of the organisation’s articles can be written by AI and the images it generates cannot represent real life.
Resist or collaborate?
AI models feed off data, but their thirst for the vital commodity has raised hackles among providers. In December, the New York Times sued OpenAI and its main investor Microsoft for violation of copyright.
 
 

In contrast, other media organisations have struck deals with OpenAI: Axel Springer, US news agency AP, French daily Le Monde and Spanish group Prisa Media, whose titles include El Pais and AS newspapers.
With resources tight in the media industry, collaborating with the new technology is tempting, explained Emily Bell, a professor at Columbia University’s journalism school. She senses a growing external pressure to “Get on board, don’t miss the train”

5,"Blast at Iraq army base kills one, injures eight","Kalsu base houses regular army, police and other forces; US military denies its forces are behind the strike","

THIS screen grab from a video shows damage after a bombing overnight on an Iraqi military base in Babylon province.—AFP

 
BAGHDAD: One person was killed and eight were wounded in an overnight explosion at an Iraqi military base housing a coalition of pro-Iranian groups, officials said on Saturday. 
The full details remain unclear hours after the blast hit the Kalsu military base in Babylon province south of Baghdad, where regular army, police and members of Iraq’s Popular Mobilisation Forces, or Hashed al-Shaabi, are stationed. 
It comes days after Iran launched an unprecedented assault on Israel which reportedly responded with a drone strike on the Islamic republic, amid tensions fuelled by the Gaza war. 
The Iraqi security forces’ media unit said “an explosion and a fire” hit the Kalsu base in the early hours of Saturday, leaving one person dead and eight wounded. 

Kalsu base houses regular army, police and other forces; US military denies its forces are behind the strike

Air defence command reported “no drones or combat aircraft in the airspace of Babylon province before or during the explosion”, it added in a statement.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility. 
Shortly after the explosion, the US military said its forces were not behind a reported strike in Iraq. “The United States has not conducted air strikes in Iraq today,” US Central Command (CENTCOM) posted on social media platform X, adding that reports that American forces had carried out a strike were “not true”. 
When reached by AFP, the Israeli army said it “does not comment on information published in foreign media”. 
In a statement, Hashed al-Shaabi said an “explosion” had inflicted “material losses” and casualties, without giving a number. The group said investigators had been sent to the site. 
On Saturday morning, however, the Hashed issued another statement that referred to a meeting between its chief of staff and investigation committees “on the site that has been attacked”. 
‘Odious crime’ 
An interior ministry official had initially reported an “aerial bombing” on the site.
“The explosion hit equipment, weapons and vehicles,” said the source. 
An Iraqi military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject, said the overnight explosion had occurred in “warehouses storing equipment”. 
Responding to questions from AFP, neither the interior ministry official nor the military official could say who may have been behind the alleged bombing. 
“We will retaliate against whoever is behind this aggression,” Hashed al-Shaabi commander Abu Alaa al-Walai wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Those involved in this odious crime will pay the price.” 
On Friday, strikes blamed on Israel targeted a military base near the city of Isfahan in central Iran. The explosion came in response to Tehran’s unprecedented attack on Israel last weekend, in retaliation for a deadly strike on Iran’s embassy in Damascus. 
Iraq’s foreign ministry expressed “strong concern” on Friday over the blast in Iran, warning of the “risks of military escalation which threatens security and stability in the region”. “This escalation must not be allowed to divert attention from what’s happening in the Gaza Strip,” it said. 
Iraqi Prime Minister Mohamed Shia al-Sudani is in Washington, where he met US President Joe Biden this week.
