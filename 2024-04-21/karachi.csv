0,Little headway in Karach’s Landhi suicide bombing investigation,Facilitators of militants involved in targeting Japanese nationals come in CTD focus.,"• Facilitators of militants come in CTD focus
• Police yet to identify suicide bomber
KARACHI: While investigators are unable to find a breakthrough in the probe into Friday’s suicide bombing in the metropolis, they are focussed on finding those who facilitated the gruesome attack, it emerged on Saturday.
Five Japanese travelling in a van escaped the suicide attack but their private security guard was killed in Landhi’s Mansehra Colony.
The investigators said that the police had recovered a motorcycle and a cell phone from the scene of crime.
“Some raids have been conducted to pick up the last owner of the motorbike as well as the seller of the cell phone and the SIM card found from one of the attackers,” said an official, adding: “However, no arrest has been made so far.”
DIG-East Azfar Mahesar told Dawn that the Counter-Terrorism Department of the Sindh police was conducting the investigations.
Sources said that an FIR regarding the Saturday attack was yet to be lodged.
The sources said the CTD sleuths were focusing on finding facilitators of the killed militants.
The investigators said the blast did not cause much damage to anyone as most of its impact was absorbed by a passing van.
While the officials said no group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack, they are certain about the involvement of Baloch insurgent groups in the suicide bombing against the foreigners.
They said that the identification of the suicide bomber could not be made. However, another attacker was identified as Sohail Ahmed, a resident of Panjgur, who had reportedly joined the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) in 2021. The sources said the law enforcers were focusing on ‘facilitators’ of the killed militants.
Inspector Abid Farooq of the Bomb Disposal Squad, who had examined the blast site and submitted a report to authorities, told Dawn when the bomber blew himself up, a Suzuki van carrying freshly baked bread came in the middle of the road and absorbed most of the impact of the blast.
He said that bomber was wearing a suicide jacket containing around four to five kilogrammes of explosives. It contained a significant number of small metal balls of ball bearings but much of the metal balls hit the lower portion of the van.
He said the young driver of van remained safe while the vehicle was damaged.
All five foreigners traveling in the Hiace remained safe, but their private security guard Noor Mohammed suffered injuries and died during treatment at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.
The deceased, father of a child, belonged to Sanghar district where his coffin was taken for burial.
Although the bomber’s accomplice, Sohail Ahmed, resorted to indiscriminate firing after taking shelter in cement blocks and gravel lying there on the road, none of the three victims suffered bullet wounds.
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the security guard died due to the shrapnel wounds to his skull.
Similarly, the two other injured people Langar Khan, 40, and Salman, 25, suffered bomb shrapnel injuries on different parts of their bodies.
The police surgeon said that Langar Khan was discharged after treatment from the JPMC while Salman, who worked at Port Qasim Authority, was taken to Aga Khan University Hospital for further treatment by his employers. Dr Summaiya Syed said both injured persons were stable.

1,JI activists stage protests  over surge in street crime,KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami on Saturday took to the streets to stage multiple protests across the metropolis ...,"KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami on Saturday took to the streets to stage multiple protests across the metropolis against increasing incidents of street crime and the failure of police in curbing the menace.
Scores of party workers gathered outside the offices of SSPs of Karachi’s seven districts to demand local policing and accountability of “black sheep” within the force.
The protesters carried party flags and placards and chanted slogan against the lawlessness in the city and poor performance of the law enforcement agency.
Senior JI leaders Muslim Pervez, Dr Fuad Ahmed and others held the 15-year-long rule of the Pakistan Peoples Party in Sindh responsible for the worsening security situation in the metropolis and other parts of the province.
They said that the Karachi police was comprised of over 37,000 policemen but unfortunately majority of them were deputed for VIP security and protocol duties. 
They said that 62 Karachiites had been killed in the last three months and more than 21,000 street crimes reported in the city during the same period. 
They said that no one was safe in Karachi as these crime statistics were enough to tell what’s happening in the metropolis.
‘Arms licences for citizens’
Mr Pervez sought an open policy for issuance of arms licences to the people of Karachi if the government was unable to protect the life and property of citizens.
He slammed the police and other law enforcement agencies for their failure in maintaining law and order in the city. 
He said that organised crimes in the city were not possible without the support of police.
He said that the JI would expand its protest drive against lawlessness in the city as an alarming surge in crimes indicated total failure of the government and other organs of the state.

2,Hundreds attend funeral in Karachi for country’s oldest priest,"Father Melito Dia, who has served many Catholic schools in various capacities, dies aged 97.","KARACHI: Reverend Father Melito Dias, the oldest priest in Pakistan, who had passed away peacefully at the Holy Family Hospital on Thursday at the age of 97, was laid to rest at the Christian Cemetery here on Saturday.
The priest’s funeral at the St Patrick’s Cathedral, led by the Archbishop of Karachi Benny Mario Travas, was attended by Cardinal Joseph Coutts, priests, nuns, his family, religious friends and a large number of people whose lives he touched throughout his 69 years of priestly ministry. During this while he also served in the educational institutions of the Archdiocese of Karachi with important posts and responsibilities.
Born in Karachi on February 27, 1927 to Maria Amata and Joseph Edward Dias, he was the fifth among nine children. From an early age his mother had a great influence on his religious upbringing as she was very close to the church and Catholic teachings. His father worked abroad for a UK-based cable and wireless company in Bahrain.
Rev Fr Melito was educated at the St Patrick’s High School in Karachi and was a star of the school’s hockey team. He was also a regular church-goer, never missing the first mass on a daily basis.
In 1946, Fr Melito left for the Papal Seminary at Kandy in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) as this part of the world did not have its own seminary at that time. In Kandy, he not only proved to be a good student but also won the hearts of his teachers and fellow students by his dedication to studies and sports.
He was ordained on August 24, 1954 at Kandy by Bishop Glennie, an American Jesuit who later became the Bishop of Trincomalee, Ceylon.
He returned to Karachi, which by then was part of a new nation — Pakistan. He came back without a passport as he had left when all areas of the Subcontinent were part of India. His first posting was at the Minor Seminary at Quetta where Rev Fr Joseph Cordeiro was the Rector and was also assigned to St Francis’ Grammar School where he coached the boys in hockey.
He then went on to serve the people of Karachi in various parishes. He also served the parish of St Joseph’s, Larkana and was instrumental in the faith formation of many in the area. 
Besides his priestly duties, Fr Melito was also a fine educationist and served many Catholic schools in Karachi such as St Patrick’s, St Paul’s and St Lawrence’s in various capacities. Needless to say, he carried out all his duties with distinction and was known for his kindness, compassion, understanding, friendly nature and humbleness. He also possessed a great sense of subtle humour.
Lately, Fr Melito had been in-and-out of the hospital. He came back to the presbytery in February where he celebrated his 97th birthday in a simple yet joyous atmosphere where he fully enjoyed himself.

3,Need stressed for training journalists in climate reporting,"KARACHI: As climate change has emerged as one of the most serious challenges for the country, environmental experts...","KARACHI: As climate change has emerged as one of the most serious challenges for the country, environmental experts and media professionals have agreed that the key issue is often sidelined in policymakers’ discussions and mainstream media and the negligence could have serious consequences for the country.  
At a session convened by the Climate Action Centre Karachi, the participants gathered to discuss efforts to raise awareness of public and policymakers about climate change.  
The event also referred to challenges including accessibility of official data and research on local environmental issues.  
The participants unanimously agreed that environmental and climate change topics were often sidelined and pointed out the lack of specialised training facilities for media persons as a significant barrier which was preventing them from excelling in climate related contribution.  
They agreed that there was an urgent need for targeted training programmes to equip both electronic and print media journalists with skills necessary to cover climate change issues effectively.  
Yasir Husain, director of the Climate Action Centre, emphasised the key role of media in climate action and promoting sustainable solutions tailored for Pakistan.  
He invited fossil energy producers to switch over to renewable energy production for clean and equitable energy.  
He said the nation was paying a high cost of fossil fuel-generated electricity and advocated for affordable and clean energy solutions.  
He urged the media to convey this critical message and emphasised the dire consequences of maintaining the status quo.  
In a move to elevate climate reporting to the forefront of mainstream media, he proposed the creation of a dedicated platform for climate journalists.  
This initiative could foster a collaborative environment for sharing knowledge and best practices, he added.

He said at the inauguration ceremony for the bus service held at Gama Stadium that yellow and orange intercity bus services would also be launched in the province this year to bring all the cities closer. 
He said that the transport service was part of 10-point agenda, inspired by the vision of Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, to help bring a revolution of progress in the province. 
He said that Pakistan Peoples Party had already introduced Benazir Income Support Program, which ensured steady provision of financial support to the downtrodden. Besides, he said, the government was building 2.1 million houses for flood-hit people in the province. 
Mirpurkhas Mayor Abdul Rauf Ghori urged the provincial government to also launch Pink Bus Service to facilitate women’s travel between Mirpurkhas and Hyderabad in minimal fair.

6,Police scramble to cover up Jacobabad arms cache recovery case,Heap all blame on 7 suspects arrested with arms found from Shikarpur chieftain's private car.,"SUKKUR: Police authorities on Saturday scrambled to cover up case of recovery a day before of a large cache of arms and ammunition from the private vehicle of a Shikarpur chieftain and leader of ruling party, and a police mobile van in his security detail, by heaping all the blame on seven suspects arrested with the arms consignment.
Sources said that the police authorities had transferred the police officials, Tariq Tareen in-charge of special squad, and his colleagues Shafaat Awan and Shamsuddin Dahar, who had intercepted the Vego and the police mobile van in Jacobabad and caught the seven suspects red-handed with the large cache of arms and ammunition.
The sources said the officials who led the raiding team were transferred overnight from Jacobabad to Ghotki district to make them an example for other overzealous officials.
They said that police had made public only a small amount of the arms and ammunition recovered from the vehicles and hidden away about 80 per cent of the cache which was not even put on record.
They said that Jacobabad police had issued a press release at 11:45pm about the arms recovery which was made at around 6pm. Police took almost five hours to change the original account of the incident in order to save the political leader who owned the Vego, they said.
They said that police had in fact tried to cover up the case by lodging the case against the seven suspects, who were produced in a Shikarpur antiterrorism court on Saturday.
Jacobabad police officials said that the seven suspects identified as Zakir Bhayo, Akhtiar Lashari, Nabeel Ahmed Bhayo, Taufique Ahmed Gujjar, ASI Imtiaz Ali Bhayo, constables Sanaullah Manganhar and Baqaullah Unnar were booked under relevant sections of Anti-Terrorism Act on a complaint lodged by SHO Ishtiaq Pathan at Mauladad police station.
They said that the ATC judge had granted physical remand of the suspects in police custody for five days.
According to the police’s press release, Jacobabad police with the help intelligence agencies intercepted the vehicle and the police mobile van and recovered one G-3 rifle with 17 magazines and one submachine gun with three magazines and 2,350 bullets of different calibers. The seven suspects were trafficking the arms, said the release.

7,SUP moot warns govt policies weakening bond between provinces and federation,Participants oppose all projects detrimental to Sindh’s interests,"HYDERABAD: The day-long ‘Sindh National Conference – Threats and Challenges’ organised by the Sindh United Party (SUP) in a local hotel on Saturday adopted a set of resolutions calling for changing the policies that were weakening provinces’ bond with the federation and depriving Sindh of its rights and resources. It apprehended that Sindh’s remaining resources would also be taken away gradually if the policies continued to be pursued.  
Leaders of a host of political and nationalist parties, as well as eminent analysts, economists, agriculture experts and civil society activists, expressed their views at the conference. They included Qaumi Awami Tehreek President Ayaz Latif Palijo, Awami Tehreek President Lal Jarwar, Grand Democratic Alliance Secretary General Safdar Abbasi, Jeay Sindh Mahaz-Riaz Chairman Riaz Chandio, Sindh Taraqqi-pasand Party’s Hyder Shahani, Awami Jamhoori Party’s Lal Shah, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz Chairman Aslam Khairpuri, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl’s Taj Mohammad Nahiyoon, Pakistan Muslim League-Functional’s Rafiq Magsi, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Nazish Fatima, Prof Majeed Chandio, Zain Daudpota, Naseer Memon and Prof Mushtaq Mirani.
The resolutions adopted by the conference called for sovereignty for federating units in line with the 1940 Resolution; reviewing [the decision of setting up] the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC); handing over of the lands, previously given to federal government and not now in its use, to Sindh; shelving of all water projects and new canal projects connected with Indus; implementation of Article 172 of the Constitution to allow provinces to manage their [respective] natural resources; reviewing the Article 15 and 23 of the Constitution which allow settling of people anywhere in the country and repatriation of those settled after 1954; a transparent investigation into rigging in the Feb 8 general elections and punishment to responsible politicians; and revamping of Sindh police, judiciary and administrative units to ensure rule of law.
Presiding over the conference, SUP President Syed Zain Shah observed that the Feb 8 general elections had thrown new challenges to Sindh. There had been people, though a few, who had always been raising the ‘national question’ ever since inception of the country but, unfortunately, there was none in 2022 when Sindh government decided to hand over its authority to federal government, he remarked. He noted with concern that the Sindh Assembly had surrendered its authority by accepting SIFC, which was empowered to take decisions on certain provincial matters without seeking permission from provinces.

Participants oppose all projects detrimental to Sindh’s interests

He claimed that all cantonments had become commercial entities. He alleged that “establishment controls elections to bring selected people and parties [to power]”. He also claimed that there was evidence that people were told to join PPP, MQM-P or PML-N.
GDA secretary general Safdar Abbasi agreed with a speaker, academic Inam Sheikh, that PPP had established a vicious circle and Sindh’s institutions had been destroyed. In the last 15 years, no qualitative change could be seen, he said. He pointed out that Asif Ali Zardari was not a neutral head of state because he still headed the Pakistan Peoples Party-Parliamentarians.
AT chief Lal Jarwar said problems were being created for Sindhi people, who now ought to organise themselves. He deplored that Sindh’s lands had been doled out for corporate farming. The PPP government took decisions that undermined Sindh’s interests like the passage of maritime law.
QAT President Ayaz Palijo said Sindhi society needed self-introspection. He noted that people of Kandhkot-Kashmore, Shikarpur and Ghotki districts were fighting for survival. He claimed that the PPP was supported by federation, establishment and judiciary. “PPP is ready to hand over everything for powers,” he remarked.
JSM-R chairman Riaz Chandio said Sindh was heading to a point where it would lose its existence. He said Sindh’s resources were being usurped and its lands occupied in the name of projects bound to convert Sindhis into a minority within their own province. Karachi’s population figures showed that future results would put Sindhis into a minority permanently and this was being facilitated by PPP, he added.
Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB) president Mahmood Nawaz Shah told the participants that people should think over whether the 18th Constitutional Amendment benefited Sindh in terms of agriculture sector, which was a 100pc devolved subject. In so many areas, there is no need for resources. This sector has rescued economy in difficult times like [Covid-19] pandemic. 
In his concluding remarks, Syed Zain Shah said he foresaw an international agenda behind the Feb 8 general election results which had made Pakistan a laughing stock in the world. 
He said the Indus River System Authority had failed to implement the 1991 Water Accord, and observed that the proposed amendment to the Irsa Act had become a challenge to Sindh. He apprehended that in the next 20 years, more lands would be given to the SIFC although it was a provincial subject. He deplored that Sindh’s collective ownership was being snatched, and feared that no voice would be raised in the Sindh Assembly against these “dangerous plans” which would, rather, be approved in a phased manner.

Villagers said that 40-year-old Talib Shar and his wife Hanalan Shar died instantly and their 11-year-old daughter Aamina Shar sustained fatal wounds in the armed attack.
They said that the area police rushed to the village after being informed of the incident and shifted the dead bodies to the nearest hospital and mounted a search for the assailants.

9,Concern over ailing lioness at Karachi Zoo,KARACHI: A zoo lioness suffering from some unknown illness for the past several months is in critical condition ...,"KARACHI: A zoo lioness suffering from some unknown illness for the past several months is in critical condition these days, it emerged on Saturday.
Sources said that the African big cat at the Karachi Zoo had lost half of its body weight and was currently under treatment. The emaciated lioness could barely walk, apparently due to starvation causing acute malnourishment, they added.
Her condition had also attracted concern on social media platforms after a video showed the lioness stumbling and falling on the ground in her cage.
Speaking to Dawn, Zoo Director Iqbal Nawaz dismissed fears about her condition. “It’s nothing but old age. She has completed her lifespan [in captivity] a longtime back and is more than 30 years old right now,” he said.
He added that lions lived up to 20 years in captivity.
He, however, conceded that the video was of the ailing lioness. “She seems to be in a playful mood [in the video], doing a somersault [to amuse visitors],” he claimed.
Asked about her veterinary care, Mr Nawaz said there was no special need. 
“As I said, she is fine. Like humans, animals too get old and suffer health problems,” he said, rejecting concerns about the health of other animals.
The sources said the Bengal tigress, the white lioness and the female bear at the zoo also suffered from some health problems.
They said that the ailing lioness was the last surviving member of the four big cats which were “imported” on an expired permit and confiscated by the customs authorities in 2010. They were later shifted to the zoo.
The last male member of the group died in October 2022.

11,Nasir Zaidi gets Ahfaz-ur-Rahman Award for media freedom,Journalist Zarrar Khuhro highlights duplicity of western media in coverage of Israeli atrocities in Gaza,"KARACHI: Veteran journalist Nasir Zaidi was given the Ahfaz-ur-Rahman Award for courage and freedom of expression for 2024 at the Arts Council of Pakistan on Saturday evening.
Mr Zaidi is one of the few journalists who received public flogging during the martial law regime of then dictator General Ziaul Haq just for raising voice for media rights and freedom.
The award is named after journalist, poet, and rights activist Ahfaz-ur-Rahman.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Zaidi said Pakistan is passing through a phase where it can’t be cited as a good example with reference to freedom of expression or freedom of the press.
“I dedicate this award to those journalists, political activists, youngsters and the underprivileged who are struggling for freedom in this country. From 1947, the media hasn’t experienced freedom. Censorship has existed in different forms during the tenures of dictatorial regimes and democratic governments. 

Journalist Zarrar Khuhro highlights duplicity of western media in coverage of Israeli atrocities in Gaza

“We hope that the young generation will continue the struggle. Hope should remain. I would like to say to journalism students [in the audience] that professionally you should be innovative and investigative,” he said.
Earlier, Dr Jaffer Ahmed while introducing Mr Zaidi said that the journalist is an inalienable part of our journalistic history. 
He went down memory lane when 46 years ago during martial law Mr Zaidi had to face hardship for his writings.
‘Western media are complicit in genocide’
On the occasion, journalist Zarrar Khuhro gave a perceptive talk on Genocide in Gaza — War on Speech and Media Complicity. 
He began his address by saying that journalists from Third World countries always look up to western media and have an inferiority complex. “But the kind of genocide and barbarism that we have witnessed [in Gaza], and the way a majority of western media has covered it, proves that they’re complicit in the genocide.”
He said in order to kill a nation one needs to form opinion and provoke people. “Western media have done that so that Israel could achieve its goals. It is nothing new. The same happened in World War II. Nazi Germany was supported by the media against the Jews. In that connection, cartoons were a popular medium because when you dehumanise the other, your job becomes easy.”
Mr Khuhro said in 2018 a peaceful protest took place in Palestine. It was called Great March of Return. In that protest, 270 unarmed people were killed. A cartoonist for the Washington Post made a cartoon in which thousands of mice were seen running away with Palestinian flags in their hands; and they’re being bombarded. 
“This atmosphere exists for the last many decades. When it comes to the media, two things need to be looked at: the choice of words and whose point of view is being projected. We have seen that after Oct 7 (2023) the first question that would be asked of Palestinian guests on TV shows was: do you condemn Hamas’ act of Oct 7? If anyone tried to tell [the anchor] what happened on Oct 6 or Oct 5 or what had been happening in seven decades, it was difficult to get the response to that. 
“The Intercept has made an analysis on what kind of coverage can be read in the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. According to it, when two Palestinians get killed, they’re mentioned just once. When an Israeli is killed, it’s mentioned eight times. When Israelis get killed, they call it a ‘slaughter’ or ‘massacre’. When Palestinians get killed, it’s not even mentioned how they’re killed. The word ‘slaughtered’ was used 60 times for Israelis and once for Palestinians. The word ‘massacred’ was used 125 times for Israelis and twice for Palestinians. And the word ‘horrific’ was used 36 times for Israelis and four times for Palestinians,” he said.
The journalist said for American newspapers, Palestinians are not killed, they simply die. 
“Eleven hundred news articles were studied in which not even once the word [Palestinian] ‘children’ was used. We call it censorship, in America it is called style guide. According to the New York Times guide, they can’t use the word ‘genocide’ and can never talk about ‘occupied territory’. Not that it’s a new phenomenon. In 2021, the headquarters for Associated Press (AP) in Gaza was destroyed by Israel. AP didn’t mention Israel in its own news item. Three years back, Israeli army killed an AP cameraman and it didn’t even mention once who killed the cameraman,” he added.
Speaking about the issue of the conflict of interest in the media, Mr Khuhro told the attendees about certain American journalists whose relatives are in the Israeli armed forces.
Play on problems being faced by Pakistani journalist
Apart from the speeches, the students of the Urdu University’s Mass Communication Department put up a play, written by Irfan Aziz, on the problems that today’s journalists are facing in Pakistan. 
One felt it was under-rehearsed because despite its simple narrative, scene shifting was taking a long time.
An oath-taking ceremony and prize distributions were also held for the students who have done well. Neha Batool and Areeba Jamil won the first position prize.
Naazir Mahmood moderated the event. A musical programme was also lined up for the evening.

12,"Excise dept, BoR miss tax collection target  by Rs46bn in nine months",Murad dissatisfied with performance of two organisations; asks to improve recovery collection,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah was informed on Saturday that the two important revenue collecting arms of the provincial government — the excise and taxation department and Board of Revenue — had failed to meet their targets during the first nine months of the current financial year.
CM Shah chaired two separate meetings of the excise and taxations department and the BoR and was visibly irked when officials informed him about the combined shortfall of over Rs46 billion in revenue collection.
Apparently, both the departments had missed their tax collection targets during the six-month rule of the caretaker government whose only responsibility was to hold the general election. The caretaker government was formed in August 2023 when Mr Shah had left the office of the CM. He resumed the same responsibility again following after his election as the leader of the house in March this year.
A press statement issued from the CM House said that the BoR had a target of Rs55.218bn tax collection during the current financial year and the nine-month target came to Rs41.414bn against which it recovered 33.57 per cent, or Rs13.901bn, showing a shortfall of Rs27.514bn.

Murad dissatisfied with performance of two organisations; asks to improve recovery collection

Similarly, the excise department also could not meet its target of Rs107.455bn showing a shortfall of Rs19.977bn as it collected Rs87.487bn during the financial year 2023-24.
The overall performance of the two tax collection arms during the past three years has been unsatisfactory as it continued to fail in achieving its recovery targets.
While government official claimed that the recovery targets of the BoR and excise department were not achieved due to abolishment and devolution of some taxes to the local government, insiders said that the rampant corruption and leakage in the revenue collection system in the two tax collection arms of the provincial government were the main cause of shortfall in revenue collection.
The press statement said that the meeting was told that the BoR during the last three years — 2020-21 to 2022-23 — was given a revenue recovery target of Rs100.640bn against which it could recover Rs48.526bn, showing a shortfall of Rs52.114bn.
The CM directed the BoR to propose revival of abolished taxes and improve e-stamping regime so that recoveries could be improved.
Excise Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Senior Member BoR Baqaullah Unar, Finance Secretary Fayaz Jatoi and others attended the meeting.
Presiding over the meeting of the excise and taxation department, the chief minister found there was a shortfall of Rs19.77bn in their revenue recoveries during the nine months of the current financial year 2023-24.
He expressed his disappointment and directed the excise department to focus on improving their recoveries. He also advised them to explore new taxation regimes, improve the old tax rates, and concentrate on professional tax and provincial excise.
The taxes and fees included Professional Tax, Provincial Excise Duty, Motor Vehicles Tax, Cotton Fee, Infrastructure Cess, Entertainment Duty, and others. 
It is worth mentioning that the property tax has been devolved to local councils.
