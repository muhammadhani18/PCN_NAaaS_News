2,CDA removes ‘encroachments’ at tennis court named after Benazir Bhutto in Islamabad,"PPP takes offence to move, terms it violation of court order.","ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Saturday demolished some structures at a tennis club – named after slain prime minister Benazir Bhutto – located on Embassy Road, prompting a strong response from the PPP which claimed that the civic body violated the stay order of the court.
The civic agency claimed that as per the directions of the Islamabad High Court, construction could not be allowed in parks. The CDA said the tennis court was not “removed at all” and only a few structures built at the tennis court were removed by the civic body to facilitate residents. The CDA also cancelled the lease of the tennis court.
According to documents, Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) Sports, Culture and Tourism Director Abeera Dilawar in an April 8 letter informed the secretary of the interior ministry’s staff welfare society that the “letter of April and May 2004 regarding the Tennis Court G-6 Community Ground were withdrawn/cancelled”.
According to another document dated April 19 this year, Civil Judge Humaira Afzal issued a stay order restraining the CDA from dispossessing the plaintiffs from the property till the next date of hearing on May 11.

PPP takes offence to move, terms it violation of court order

PPP stalwart Farhatullah Babar said the cancellation of the lease was “mischievous”. He said for the past decade, international and national tournaments were being organised at the club.
“Cancellation of the lease is…an attack on the institution named after Benazir Bhutto,” he claimed, adding that the CDA bulldozed the structures in the ground, alleging that the civic agency “tore” the stay order issued by the court.
“Initially a conspiracy was hatched to abolish the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) and then the lease has been cancelled… [it]is an example of the bias and hate against the slain leader,” he said.
A CDA official on the condition of anonymity said it was unfortunate to involve the name of Benazir Bhutto in the episode.
“I don’t know if any court has issued a stay order but we have clear orders from the IHC that construction cannot be allowed in the parks. The fact is that there is a long green strip along Embassy Road on which there is a park named ‘Sukh Chayn’ and then there is a tennis court which has been fenced. The third part of the green belt is under the control of the CDA. We have just removed the fence and the tennis court is very much intact,” he claimed.
The decision was taken to provide the residents with ample walking space which was being hindered by the fence installed around the tennis court.
“We have just removed the fence and some of the structures/rooms which were being used by some people for ‘inappropriate’ activities,” he claimed.
The official claimed that an individual allegedly connected to the tennis court tried to damage the structure. “He wanted to give an impression that CDA has taken action against the tennis court which is not correct at all,” he said.
The CDA also shared a video in which it was claimed that only structures were removed during the operation and the tennis court was “very much intact”.

3,PSB chief challenges dismissal in IHC,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) Director General Shoaib Khoso challenged the termination of his contract in...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) Director General Shoaib Khoso challenged the termination of his contract in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Saturday. 
Mr Khoso’s three-year contract was terminated a day earlier amid a row between the PSB and its administrative Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC). 
He challenged the notification issued for his termination through his counsel Mohammad Shoaib Shaheen. The petition has been fixed before IHC Justice Babar Sattar. 
Justice Sattar was already hearing a petition against the appointment of Mr Khoso as the PSB chief. 
The ministry terminated his contract on Friday and the Establishment Division issued a notification. 
The Establishment Division also assigned the additional charge to Zahoor Ahmed, a BS-21 officer of Secretariat Group, presently working as additional secretary in the IPC ministry for three months. 
Earlier this week, the PSB had challenged the authority of the secretary IPC and termed posting, assigning look-after charge in the board by the ministry as contradictory to the Establishment Division’s rules. 
In a letter sent to the secretary IPC on April 15, PSB’s Deputy Director General (Admin) Mansoor Ahmed Khan stated that while the DG PSB was on ex-Pakistan leave, the ministry assigned the charge to a junior officer of BS-19.
The letter termed this against the Management Pay Scale Policy approved by the prime minister that provided that “the current charge/additional charge of the position of heads of autonomous bodies in MP-scales only be granted to a civil or government servants of equivalent grad and that too with the approval of the appointing authority which is the prime minister.”
Sarfraz Rasool, an assistant engineer of the PSB, on April 17 challenged the postings/ transfers made in the board by the acting DG and the Islamabad 
High Court (IHC) issued a stay order. 
Interestingly, the appointment of the PSB head made in the PDM government was also sub judice in the IHC; however, the IPC ministry terminated his contract “by paying one month’s salary in lieu of one month notice with immediate effect.”

CHAKWAL: A neck-and-neck contest is likely to be witnessed in PP-22 (Chakwal-cum-Talagang) between candidates of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) in the by-election on Sunday (today).
PP-22, a sub-constituency of NA-59, was won by PML-N candidate Sardar Ghulam Abbas who was also victorious in NA-59 in the Feb 8 polls. Mr Abbas, however, retained his National Assembly seat and vacated PP-22.
According to sources in the PML-N, Mr Abbas wanted the PP-22 ticket for his younger brother but the party instead awarded ticket to Malik Falak Sher Awan, a businessman from Talagang.

Books on various subjects were showcased in the main hall, as the book fair had more than 50 stalls with around 100,000 books on different subjects, including science, fiction, Islamic literature, medicine, engineering and technology.
Students visiting the fair lauded the effort of SSEFP, stating that the books were a great source of inner enlightenment.
Deputy Commissioner Attock Rao Atif Raza, who was the chief guest at the closing ceremony, said the love for books was a common trait among successful people worldwide, and no matter the advancements in technology, the significance of a traditional paper-bound book could not be undermined.
He emphasised the pivotal role of reading in human development and said the involvement of youth in extracurricular activities could definitely help the government in its endeavour to uproot violence from society.
“Students need to improve their book reading habit and should make it a part of their lives,” he advised, adding that books opened new doors of success for their readers, allowing them to explore new ideas.
Mr Raza said there was a dire need to inculcate book-reading habit among the youth so that they could learn about the glorious past, encouraging parents and teachers to cultivate a love for reading in children to create enthusiastic readers.
He said books were valuable companions that fostered empathy, ingenuity and education in those who read them.

10,"India investing heavily on ideological subversion, says PML-N leader",MUZAFFARABAD: Former Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister and senior PML-N leader Raja Farooq Haider on...,"MUZAFFARABAD: Former Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister and senior PML-N leader Raja Farooq Haider on Saturday warned that India was investing heavily on ideological subversion in the liberated territory and some from amongst the young generation were unknowingly falling prey to its propaganda, which needed to be dealt with under a systematic strategy.
“I am not antagonistic to any ideology. People who stand for an independent state of Jammu and Kashmir in good faith and not as anyone’s pawns are respectable to me, but any final decision regarding the future status has to be taken through a [UN sponsored] referendum,” he said at a prayer gathering held here to mark the death anniversary of his father, Raja Mohammad Haider Khan, an eminent leader of Kashmir freedom movement.
Pointing out that almost all pro-freedom leaders across the divide had spent their lives in Indian jails, Mr Haider questioned: “Why can’t we agree on a single point - the plebiscite - for the sake of our oppressed Kashmiri brethren?”
“I believe that all units of the [erstwhile princely] state of Jammu and Kashmir can unite on the option of unconditional right to self-determination,” he said.
Mr Haider said he held Maqbool Butt Shaheed in high esteem with whom he had held several sittings.
Without specifically naming anyone, Mr Haider said some people were trying to widen friction in AJK by resorting to hatred, bigotry and foul language.
“Across the divide, sacrifices have been offered by generation after generation. Instead of praising their courage and valiance, we are fighting with each other and nobody seems to be concerned about the obligations we owe to our struggling brethren.”
Taking strong exception to those who were drawing comparison between the price of commodities in AJK and occupied Kashmir, Mr Haider said Kashmiris had not offered their blood for cheap rice and pulses, but for freedom.
Of the parliamentary polls in occupied Kashmir, Mr Haider recalled that India had been conducting this exercise for the past seven decades but no one in the world bought elections as a substitute for the plebiscite.
“The election drama in the current situation carries no significance either. It will make no difference to the status of the longstanding issue… Though there are some difficulties at the moment but Kashmiris have gone through similar situations in the past as well. Neither has their movement stopped before nor will it weaken now.”
“Their strategies keep on changing in accordance with the situation and available opportunities.”
Of AJK’s internal situation, Mr Haider maintained that following a court judgment, all legislators had become free of party affiliations and as such there was no political party in the assembly.
“I am a low-ranking political worker of PML-N. Iwant to see myparty strengthened and will play my role for the same. However, in the prevailing circumstances, the onus is on party office bearers to devise a course of action to deal with the prevailing situation and make the party strong,” he said.
He maintained that political parties had practically become irrelevant and non-existent in AJK due to the ideological deterioration.
He vowed that he could continue to play his role for the freedom movement and development of AJK.
“I would like to ask the AJK people, particularly the political workers, to bestir themselves because bad times do not last long and are followed by good times.What’s needed is perseverance.”
He also advised the coalition government not to axe and starve temporary employees and keep in mind that it had itself come into existence without any merit.
“Those who bring anyone to power are considered equally responsible for the failures and malfunctions of government,” he said, in a reference to the powers that be.

12,"Untimely rain spell, inflation add to Potohar farmers’ worries","Though the harvest has begun in some parts of the plateau, farmers are worried that the untimely rains will harm the yield.","As a prolonged spell of rain delays wheat harvest in the Potohar region, farmers have complained about an unprecedented rise in the cost of harvest, saying it has increased twofold on the back of an increase in the price of petroleum products compared to the previous year.
Though the harvest has begun in some parts of the plateau, farmers are worried that the untimely rains will harm the yield. They also fret about the rise in the cost of petroleum products, electricity, labour and agricultural machinery.
Chaudhry Rab Nawaz, a farmer in Gujar Khan, said the recent rains had delayed the harvest and he was waiting for clear skies to kick-start the harvest on his 60-acre land. He feared that the yield quality and quantity could be affected if the rain spell continued for a few more days.
Raja Sohail Janjua echoed similar sentiments, as he complained about the rise in labour costs. Last year, labourers would charge Rs1,000 for a day but now their daily wages have increased to Rs1,500, he said, adding that a “can of engine oil” for tractors that was available in the market for up to Rs4,500 during the previous season had also skyrocketed to Rs5,500. Similarly, a new oil filter cost him Rs950 instead of Rs150 a year ago.
Mr Janjua is also worried about rates thresher owners would charge him this year. Last year, the machine owners used to provide services for up to Rs4,000 per hour but this year there is uncertainty about their price since the harvesting season has yet to kick-start due to untimely rains. He feared torrential rains and hailstorms could affect the crop’s yield.
 

Rains have forced farmers to leave crop bundles in the fields.

Raja Zainul Abideen, another farmer in the tehsil, told Dawn that small agriculturalists were badly hit by the rising cost of agriculture. He said small landowners could not afford urea, DAP, or till their land as many as five times to make the land suitable for sowing due to inflation.
Due to an increase in the cost of fuel and tractors’ rent, they could not properly cater to their fields, adversely impacting the produce, he said, adding that a well-ploughed land fed with fertilisers would have a higher yield compared to a less-ploughed one.
About urea prices, Mr Nawaz told Dawn that the 50kg bag of DAP fertiliser cost Rs7,000 in 2022 compared to Rs15,000-16,000 in 2023. He added that the bag of urea that was available for Rs2,000-2,200 in 2022 was sold at Rs6,000 in 2023. He disclosed that the farmers had to produce these products from the ‘black market’, forcing many to refrain from using urea due to its non-affordability and shortage.
Amid these factors, Raja Zain urged the government to set the per mound (40/kg) price of wheat at about Rs5,000, which would be the minimum cost to cover their expenses as well as earn some profit.
He lamented that no subsidy was available to the farmers of the tehsil while the performance of the agriculture department was also disappointing. He said the survival of farmers had become “next to impossible due to the skyrocketing cost of living in the country”, and called upon the government to bring reforms for their uplift.
Procurement target
According to the sources in the food department, the government has set a minimum support price of Rs3,900/40kg, and has set a target of procuring up to two million metric tonnes of wheat during the scheme year 2024-25.

Rawalpindi Food Department Deputy Director Mahar Abbas Haral said the spell of rain was causing harvest delays, adding that the “moisture content in wheat is counterproductive”. He added that heavy rains and storms could cause “partial damage” to wheat.
Mr Haral said that the quality and quantity of the crop may be affected, adding that climate change was impacting harvesting patterns.
Rawalpindi division Agriculture Director Syed Iftikhar Bokhari said he also noticed the suspension of harvesting due to rains. He, however, claimed that temperature would rise in the next few days allowing the farmers to expedite the harvest.

Though the recent rains posed difficulties for farmers, it was fortunate that they were not accompanied by strong winds due to “lodging (fall) of crops stems was minimal,” he added.
The director said the farmers should get “maximum advantage of the expected hotter and dry week” to harvest the crop.
