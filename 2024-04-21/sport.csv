Top seed Swiatek, the 2022 and 2023 champion at the German clay-court tournament, saw off former US Open champion Raducanu 7-6 (7/2), 6-3 and will face fourth seed Elena Rybakina for a place in Sunday’s final. 
Rybakina reached the semi-finals after overcoming the challenge of in-form Jasmine Paolini 6-3, 5-7, 6-3. 
World number two Sabalenka’s hopes of reaching a fourth consecutive Stuttgart Open final ended after a 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 quarter-final defeat by reig­ning Wimbledon cham­pion Marketa Vond­rousova. 
The sixth-seeded Czech celebrated her first win over Sabalenka in six years after losing four in a row between 2018 and 2023.
Vondrousova will face Ukraine’s Marta Kostyuk for a place in the final after the 27th-ranked Ukrainian avenged her Australian Open quarter-final loss to Gauff, the world number three, with a 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (8/6) win.

1,‘Chinese swimmers failed doping tests ahead of Tokyo Olympics’,NEW YORK: Twenty-three Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned substance ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021...,"NEW YORK: Twenty-three Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned substance ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 but were allowed to compete after world governing bodies secretly accepted China’s findings that they had ingested it unknowingly, The New York Times said on Saturday.
The athletes included nearly half of the swimming team that China sent to Japan, with several going on to win medals, including gold, according to the report. The country’s 30-member swimming team won six medals at Tokyo, including three golds.
Many are expected to be in contention again at the Paris Olympics this summer.
The newspaper reported that they tested positive for a prescription heart drug, trimetazidine (TMZ), that can enhance performance at a domestic meet in late 2020 and the first days of 2021.
But it was determined by Chinese anti-doping authorities that they ingested the substance unwittingly from tainted food and no action against them was warranted.
The NYT cited a review of confidential documents and emails, including a report compiled by the Chinese anti-doping agency and submitted to its global counterpart WADA.
It said WADA and swimming’s governing body World Aquatics, which at the time was known as FINA, decided not to act due to  “a lack of any credible evidence” to challenge China’s version of events.
WADA, in a statement on Saturday decrying  “some misleading and potentially defamatory media coverage this week”, said that it had  “ultimately concluded that it was not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination was the source of TMZ and it was compatible with the analytical data in the file”.
“WADA also concluded that, given the specific circumstances of the asserted contamination, the athletes would be held to have no fault or negligence.”
WADA’s senior director of science and medicine Olivier Rabin added:  “Ultimately, we concluded that there was no concrete basis to challenge the asserted contamination.”
World Aquatics confirmed to the New York Times the cases had been reviewed by a doping control board and were subjected to independent expert scrutiny.
“World Aquatics is confident that these AAFs [adverse analytical findings] were handled diligently and professionally, and in accordance with all applicable anti-doping regulations, including the World Anti-Doping Code,” it said.
But the United States Anti-Doping Agency said the swimmers should have been suspended and publicly identified, calling WADA’s lack of action  “a devastating stab in the back of clean athletes”.
The organisation’s chief executive Travis T. Tygart claimed he had provided WADA with allegations of doping in Chinese swimming multiple times since 2020.
WADA said that  “the information provided to us by USADA and others was reviewed on each occasion in line with our normal procedure, and assessed according to the criteria stipulated within our Confidential Source Policy”.
“The data held by us clearly showed that there had been no attempt to hide the positive tests as they had been reported in the usual way by the Chinese authorities. Therefore, based on the available information and a lack of any credible evidence, the threshold for WADA I&I [Intelligence and Investigations Department] to open an investigation was not met.”
China’s anti-doping authority was not immediately available for comment.
There was no immediate reply from China’s swimming association when contacted for comment.
Chinese swimming has a chequered doping history, with a rash of cases throughout the 1990s. Seven Chinese swimmers tested positive for steroids at the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima.
In 1998, swimmer Yuan Yuan was banned after Australian customs officers discovered a large stash of human growth hormone in her bags at the World Championships in Perth.
More recently, three-time Olympic champion Sun Yang was banned for doping, ruling him out of the Tokyo Olympics.

Venezuelan-born Muguruza won the French Open in 2016 and Wimbledon in 2017, and she reached the final of the Australian Open in 2020. Last April she said she would take a break from competition to spend more time with her family. 
“I didn’t miss the discipline and the difficulty of the life I had before. I have been realising that what I most want to look forward to is my next chapter and not the tennis chapter,” she told a news conference at the Laureus Awards in Madrid. 
“The time has come to say goodbye, it has been a long and beautiful career, but I feel the time has come to retire. It’s a decision that I’ve been taking little by little.” 
Muguruza, 30, was ranked number one in 2017 and was ranked as high as third by the end of 2021 when she won three WTA titles.

3,Frankfurt boost Euro hopes with win against Augsburg,BERLIN: Eintracht Frankfurt took a big stride towards European football next season as they came from a goal down to...,"BERLIN: Eintracht Frankfurt took a big stride towards European football next season as they came from a goal down to secure a 3-1 Bundesliga victory over FC Augsburg on Friday.
The result strengthened Frankfurt’s bid to secure a spot in the Europa Conference League qualifiers next season as they are sixth in the standings with 45 points, six ahead seventh-placed Augsburg.
Ruben Vargas opened the scoring for Augsburg in the 13th minute as he latched on to a pass inside the box and slotted it into the net from an acute angle.
Following the interval, Frankfurt played with more purpose and Eric Ebimbe delivered a well-timed cross to an unmarked Fares Chaibi, who slotted in the equaliser from close range.
The hosts completed the turnaround after 61 minutes when Hugo Ekitike unleashed a low shot into the net from the edge of the box.
As Augsburg sent every player up front for a last-ditch attempt at finding an equaliser late into stoppage time, Frankfurt managed to get the ball to Omar Marmoush and the Egyptian striker fired into an open net to complete the win.

4,Hurting Barca bid to slow Real’s  title charge in Clasico,BARCELONA: Barcelona must dust themselves down after Champions League defeat to try and slow Real Madrid’s steady...,"BARCELONA: Barcelona must dust themselves down after Champions League defeat to try and slow Real Madrid’s steady march towards the La Liga title in Sunday’s Clasico. 
The Spanish champions can make a last stand by reeling Real’s lead in to five points at the Santiago Bernabeu, even if overhauling their arch-rivals with seven matches remaining to defend the trophy is a tough task. 
Paris St Germain brought Barca’s European adventure to an end in painful fashion on Tuesday, overhauling the Catalans’ two-goal lead in the tie. 
Picking up his squad emotionally after that defeat will not be an easy task for Xavi Hernandez, with some Spanish reports saying the coach may leave his post after the game with reserve team coach Rafael Marquez a possible replacement. 
Xavi said in January he would depart at the end of the season and despite a strong run of form since leading to a clamour for him to stay, has not changed his mind. 
Defeat by PSG in the Champions League quarter-finals may have ended any chance of that happening, beyond a miracle comeback in La Liga. 
If that is to happen it must begin in the capital against a Real side exhausted but jubilant after they beat treble-winners Manchester City on penalties on Wednesday to reach the semi-finals. 
“On Sunday we are playing for the league title. We have to win,” Xavi told a press conference on Saturday. 
“We have to manage our feelings and move on, let the frustration and impotence of the other day [elimination from the Champions League] which are difficult to digest turn in our favour. We will have a morale-strengthened Real Madrid in front of us. 
“On Sunday we have the chance to get back into La Liga title race. It will be the most important game of the season.” 
Xavi praised Real for beating “the best team in the world” in City and said he will need a near flawless performance by his side to leave the Santiago Bernabeu stadium with a win. 
“We will face a Real Madrid with euphoria through the roof. We need to overcome the Champions League hangover and have a team with all the enthusiasm in the world to fight for this league,” Xavi said. 
Xavi’s counterpart at Madrid, Carlo Ancelotti, said his team could strike a killer blow in the title race. 
“It’s a great chance for us to get closer to winning La Liga, but we know it’s hard because Barcelona are a very competitive side,” the Italian told a press conference on Saturday. “We are very close if we are capable of winning ... it will be the usual Clasico, a hard-fought, equal game.”  
Real are aiming to win a league and Champions League double for the fifth time in their history. 
“The cake is prepared and we have to put the cherry on top this month,” said Ancelotti. “We’re very well positioned.”

5,Own goal helps off-form Juve draw at Cagliari,CAGLIARI: A late own goal by defender Alberto Dossena salvaged a 2-2 draw for Juventus at lowly Cagliari in Serie A...,"CAGLIARI: A late own goal by defender Alberto Dossena salvaged a 2-2 draw for Juventus at lowly Cagliari in Serie A on Friday after the hosts went two goals up in the first half thanks to penalties. 
Trailing at the break to penalties from Gianluca Gaetano and Yerry Mina, Juve claw themselves to a point as Dusan Vlahovic whipped in a perfect 62nd-minute free-kick before Dossena’s unfortunate own goal three minutes from time. 
Juve, who have yet to seal their return to the Champions League after missing out on the European competitions this season, are third on 64 points after 33 games, five points ahead of fourth-placed Bologna who visit AS Roma, in fifth, on Monday. 
The draw is another of a number of disappointing recent results for Massimiliano Allegri’s side whose season is petering out towards a drab ending after for a time promising a league title race. 
Two wins in 12 matches have left Juve 19 points behind league leaders Inter Milan, who can secure the Scudetto by beating local rivals AC Milan on Monday night. 
“We recovered it but today’s performance must make us think,” coach Massimiliano Allegri told Sky Sport. “You cannot leave a whole first half to the opponent... We missed so many simple things. So many passes. We gave away every ball we could. After the first half I should have changed them all. Myself included. I saw technical errors that I didn’t want to believe. 
“Then we did well to put it back on its feet... I’ll take the point and the second half. At the end of the season we need to sit down and assess things, from there we’ll kick on. The most important thing right now is securing Champions League football.” 
It was far from a dream start for Allegri’s side when Gaetano put Cagliari in front in the 30th minute, sending Juve keeper Wojciech Szczesny the wrong way after they were awarded a penalty for a Gleison Bremer handball. 
The hosts won another penalty when Szczesny attempted to stop the racing forward Zito Luvumbo with a foul, and Mina converted from the spot again to double their lead six minutes later. 
Vlahovic thought he pulled one back for Juve before the break but his close-range effort was ruled out for offside. 
The Serbian striker, however, made no mistake in the second half when he netted a free kick from just outside the box, which was given to Juve for Nahitan Nandez’s foul on Federico Chiesa. 
Juventus had 75% possession as the game neared to a close but continued to lack sharpness in attack. 
Cagliari thought they were about to seal the much-needed three points when their defender Dossena levelled for the visitors with an own goal three minutes from the end. 
Juve forward Kenan Yildiz sent a long cross inside the box and an unsuccessful clearance by Dossena sent the ball past their keeper Simone Scuffet. 
Cagliari stay 14th, five points above the relegation zone. One defeat in their last nine games and a series of hugely impressive performances have lifted Cagliari away from danger after being second-from-bottom in mid-February. 
“We need to stay united and we’ll stay in Serie A. The fans deserve and I hope they are proud of us because the boys gave absolutely everything,” said coach Claudio Ranieri. 
Confirmation of Serie A’s fifth spot in next season’s Champions League means Juve are effectively guaranteed a place in next year’s tournament.  With five matches remaining in their campaign Juve are 12 points above sixth-placed Lazio who are three points from the Champions League places thanks to want-away star Luis Alberto shooting them to a 1-0 win at Genoa. 
Luis Alberto swept home the decisive goal in the 57th minute, only a few days after saying that he wanted to rescind his contract. 
His goal pushed Lazio to within sight of local rivals Roma, who also have the final 18 minutes of their interrupted fixture at Udinese to play on April 25, a match which was locked at 1-1 when Evan Ndicka’s on-pitch collapse caused play to be suspended.

6,Verstappen enjoys ‘incredible’ pole after China sprint win,SHANGHAI: Max Verstappen continued his dominant start to the season in emphatic style on Saturday by romping to...,"SHANGHAI: Max Verstappen continued his dominant start to the season in emphatic style on Saturday by romping to sprint victory then claiming pole position for the Chinese Grand Prix — an  “incredible” 100th for his Red Bull team.
It was an ominous display from Verstappen, who looks on course to win a fourth Grand Prix out of five on Sunday as he marches towards a fourth consecutive world title.
The Red Bull driver was 0.322 seconds clear of Sergio Perez as Red Bull locked up the front row, with Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso third on Formula One’s return to China after five years away.
Verstappen clocked a fastest lap of 1min 33.660sec to record the team milestone and his first pole at the Shanghai Intern­ational Circuit.
“Before I jumped in the car [Red Bull chief Christian] Horner told me if you get pole today it could be number 100 for the team, so I was like, ‘OK, that’s nice, I’ll give it a good go’,” Verstappen said.
“Of course that’s an incredible achievement for the whole team.”
Verstappen won the 19-lap sprint in the morning by a huge 13 seconds from Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes as the Dutchman laid down a marker for Sunday’s 56-lap race.
“The car worked even better in qualifying,” said Verstappen. “That final lap felt pretty decent and very happy to drive here in the dry, it was a lot of fun.
“If the car is even half as good tomorrow as it was in the sprint we will be all right.”
Lando Norris will start on the second row in his McLaren alongside Alonso for the first Grand Prix to be held in China since 2019 because of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.
Oscar Piastri was fifth fastest in the second McLaren ahead of the Ferrari pair of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, with George Russell’s Mercedes eighth.
Perez was relieved to be on the front row.
“Very intense, I nearly got knocked out in Q1,” said the Mexican.  “In the final run the track was getting quite a bit better and I managed to put a good lap together.”
Leclerc said he hoped Ferrari could be stronger on Sunday.
“We compromised our qualifying by prioritising the race tomorrow and struggled slightly more than we expected,” said Leclerc.
“Our race pace is strong and it will be a long one, with tyre degradation playing a big role here.”
Earlier, Verstappen blasted from fourth on the sprint grid to an easy victory that increased his championship lead over Perez to 25 points.
But Hamilton’s joy at coming second turned to despair in Q1 when the Englishman locked up, relegating him to 18th.
It was the first time since the 2022 Saudi Grand Prix that the seven-time world champion had been knocked out so early.
“I made massive changes into qualifying,” said Hamilton who won the last Chinese Grand Prix in 2019.
“It is what it is. We can still have some fun even if we are starting from P18.”
Sainz is the only driver apart from Verstappen to win a Grand Prix in 2024 and he survived a huge scare in Q2.
The Spaniard ran wide at the final bend and span across the start-finish straight to lose his nose cone in the barriers.
It brought out the red flags but Sainz was able to limp back to the pits and make it to the top 10 shootout.
“I had a big moment there, touching the gravel,” Sainz said.  “From then on, a tough quali. I just don’t think we have been very quick this weekend. It’s a difficult track for us.”
Huge crowds turned out to see Shanghai native Zhou Guanyu, China’s first Formula One driver, on the first Chinese Grand Prix weekend since 2019.
The fans had plenty to cheer Friday when Zhou propelled his Sauber into the top 10 in a wet sprint qualifying but he narrowly missed out on scoring a sprint point by finishing ninth.
Zhou failed to make it out of Q1, to groans from the packed grandstands, and will start 16th on the grid.

7,Tsitsipas faces  Ruud rematch in Barcelona Open final,"Tsitsipas, seventh in the world rankings, battled back after a shaky first set and overpowered his Serbian opponent.","BARCELONA: Stefanos Tsitipas set up a rematch with Casper Ruud in the Barcelona Open final by defeating Dusan Lajovic 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 on Saturday.
The Greek beat world number six Ruud last week in the Monte Carlo Masters final, inflicting the Norwegian’s third final defeat this year.
Ruud, a three-time Grand Slam runner-up, edged past Tomas Etcheverry 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 earlier on Saturday in the first semi-final to record his tour-leading 28th win of the season.
Tsitsipas, seventh in the world rankings, battled back after a shaky first set and overpowered his Serbian opponent.
“It was not [easy] at all, he was fighting really hard, I wasn’t very consistent,” said Tsitsipas. “The more the match progressed I got deeper into the reasons of why I’m not winning the games I need to win — I got really deep with myself and tried to escape that one-way route the match started at.”
Tsitsipas saved a break point to hold for 4-4 in the first set in which he committed several unforced errors, and Lajovic secured it when the Greek pushed a shot into the net.
However the 25-year-old broke decisively in the second set for a 4-3 lead and then dominated in the third set.
“I delivered really different tennis and a much better version of myself in the second and third set,” added Tsitsipas.
Ruud triumphed in straight sets earlier but Etcheverry tested him.
“It’s been fantastic, two weeks has been really good, two finals in a row and it’s gonna be special tomorrow, I’m gonna play for the biggest title of my career,” Ruud told Teledeporte.
“It was a difficult match, level-wise maybe it was my best match here in Barcelona, a very tough opponent, Tomas is playing fantastic tennis.
“I was a bit lucky in the first set... but that’s what you need sometimes, a bit of luck.”
Ruud lost two finals in Mexico and then against Tsitsipas in Monte Carlo but is enjoying a strong season.
The players traded breaks in the first set, with Ruud’s superb forehand winner earning him a 4-2 lead.
However Etcheverry broke back with Ruud slapping another forehand into the net and consolidated for 4-4. Ruud dropped two set points before eventually shading a tight tie-break.
In the second set Ruud broke straight away but Etcheverry immediately hit back. The Norwegian broke again in the fifth game and served it out.
Ruud wrapped up his win by converting the second of three match points when Etcheverry sent a return into the net.

8,Bowlers set up comfortable victory for Pakistan in second NZ T20,"RAWALPINDI: Shaheen Shah Afridi seemed to be back to his devastating best. Mohammad Amir, bowling in his first...","RAWALPINDI: Shaheen Shah Afridi seemed to be back to his devastating best. Mohammad Amir, bowling in his first international match after three and a half years, looked as if he’d never been away. Newcomer Abrar Ahmed added zip and guile to the spin bowling department. Ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup, Pakistan’s bowling attack looked complete and New Zealand had no answer.
Pakistan’s pacers and spinners turned up the style to lead their side to victory over New Zealand in the second Twenty20 International at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Saturday.
In front of a partisan crowd, fast bowlers Shaheen (3-13), Amir (2-13) and Naseem Shah (1-27) picked up six wickets among them while spinners Abrar (2-15) and Shadab Khan (2-15) equally shared four wickets as Pakistan shot down a New Zealand side missing several first-team regulars for 90 in 18.2 overs after skipper Babar Azam had elected to field.
Pakistan, though, didn’t cruise towards the paltry target, losing three wickets before Mohammad Rizwan (45 not out) and Irfan Khan Niazi (18 not out) carried them past New Zealand with 7.5 overs to spare. Rizwan, who hit the winning boundary over square leg, smashed a six and four fours in his 33-ball knock while Irfan’s run-a-ball effort featured a six and a four.
Unlike the rain-hit first game where New Zealand saw Tim Robinson bowled by Shaheen on the second and last ball, the visitors negotiated the first two overs without any damage.
But Shaheen made the breakthrough soon after with Shadab diving to his right at backward point to pouch Tim Seifert (12).
Amir, who has come back into the side after taking back his international retirement, then enjoyed a stunning return with just the second delivery he bowled, a slower one deceiving Robinson (four) who gave Iftikhar Ahmed an easy catch at short cover.
Another change in pace gave Amir his second wicket, Dean Foxcroft (13) departing after holing to Babar at mid-off, having hit a six off the pacer two balls earlier; New Zealand ending the powerplay at 35-3.
Abrar broke the spine of New Zealand’s batting lineup with two wickets in the first over he bowled. First, he had Mark Chapman, who made 19 with three boundaries, caught at deep square leg and then had James Neesham caught at short mid-wicket two deliveries later.
Shadab then accounted for Michael Bracewell, the New Zealand skipper undone by a quicker one to leave the tourists at 59-6. The Black Caps resisted further losses for a brief period but Shaheen returned to clean up Cole McConchie (15) with a searing yorker and Ish Sodhi’s attempt to go big saw him fall lbw to Shadab soon after. 
Naseem got his only wicket when Ben Sears found Babar at mid-off and Shaheen ended New Zealand’s innings with another sizzling yorker that hit Ben Lister’s off-stump.
Lister gave New Zealand some hope when he removed Pakistan opener Saim Ayub (four) with a brilliant, diving return catch early on. 
After a tentative start, Rizwan and Babar opened their arms in the fourth over as Sears was smacked for a six and four by the former and a boundary by the Pakistan skipper. 
In the next over, Rizwan and Babar added a four each of Bracewell but the spinner hit back against his Pakistan counterpart, getting him stumped for 14 as the hosts finished the powerplay at 48-2.
Usman Khan, another newcomer to the side ahead of the World Cup in the United States and West Indies, made seven before he dragged a Sodhi delivery onto his stumps.
But Rizwan and Irfan, who was one of three debutants for Pakistan alongside Usman and Abrar in the last game, ensured there was no further damage.

9,‘Rahul can play himself into World Cup spot with IPL heroics’,LUCKNOW: Lucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul will be among the front-runners for the wicket-keeper/batsman role in...,"LUCKNOW: Lucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul will be among the front-runners for the wicket-keeper/batsman role in India’s Twenty20 World Cup squad if he can maintain his recent Indian Premier League (IPL) form, former batsman Robin Uthappa said.
Rahul followed up scores of 33, 39 and 39 with a blistering 53-ball 82 that included nine fours and three sixes to help his side to an eight-wicket win over defending champions Chennai Super Kings on Friday.
As Indian selectors finalise a squad for the World Cup in the United States and West Indies in June, Rahul has emerged as an option alongside Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson despite not playing a T20 International since Nov 10, 2022.
“Over the last couple of weeks, I was thinking, I don’t think he’s going to figure in the World Cup squad, but if he continues to bat the way he is batting now he’ll find himself a spot,” 2007 T20 World Cup winner Uthappa said on JioCinema.
“Whether it’s as a reserve opener and wicket-keeper, that’s a dual role he can fulfil.
“He just makes batting look so beautiful. He’s one of those guys who makes it for a viewer, a delightful experience to watch cricket, an easy experience, and just all the other shots that he plays.”
Former Australian wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist said before the match that there would be a lot of talk about World Cup selections in the coming weeks but it would be performances on the pitch that ultimately count.
“The narrative has to get away from who’s going on the World Cup,” Gilchrist told Cricbuzz.
“How do they get into the World cup? He [Rahul] has got to work out like every other player in this tournament. You’ll be on the plane if you’re in the narrative of selecting.”

10,"Luton’s survival hopes battered, Burnley still alive",Luton’s heaviest home league defeat of the season leaves the Hatters still one point adrift of Nottingham Forest.,"LONDON: Luton Town’s hopes of Premier League survival were hammered by Brentford’s 5-1 rout at Kenilworth Road, while Burnley thrashed Sheffield United 4-1 to remain in the fight to stay up on Saturday.
Brentford realistically secured their top-flight status with a dominant display despite missing England striker Ivan Toney through injury.
Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo had to carry the offensive burden for the Bees during Toney’s ban for breaking gambling rules in the first half of the season.
They combined for a spectacular opening goal as Wissa smashed Mbeumo’s pass into the top corner.
Wissa’s second just before half-time was more scrappy as he bundled the ball in from close range.
Ethan Pinnock crashed in a header from a Sergio Reguilon corner before Keane Lewis-Potter stole in at the back post to turn in Mbeumo’s cross.
Kevin Schade made it 5-0 but Luke Berry netted a Luton consolation in stoppage time.
Luton’s heaviest home league defeat of the season leaves the Hatters still one point adrift of Nottingham Forest, who visit Everton on Sunday in a huge clash at the bottom of the table.
Burnley are now within two points of Luton and three of survival after cruising to victory at rock bottom Sheffield United.
Two of the Clarets’ five league wins this season have come against the Blades.
Burnley scored twice in two minutes just before half-time through Jacob Bruun Larsen and Lorenz Assignon.
Gustavo Hamer pulled a goal back for the home side early in the second period.
But United are destined to head straight back down to the Championship due to their woeful defending.
Lyle Foster was given far too much room in the box to turn in Assignon’s cross.
Johann Gudmundsson rounded off the scoring with a fine finish into the far corner.
Chris Wilder’s men remain 10 points adrift of safety with just five games remaining.

11,Unstoppable Duplantis breaks pole vault record again in Xiamen,"The 24-year-old, who was the only man to clear six metres at the Egret Stadium, says he can do even better.","XIAMEN: Sweden’s Armand Duplantis put down a marker ahead of this year’s Paris Olympics as the Swede broke his own pole vault world record with a 6.24 metres effort in the first Diamond League meeting of the 2024 season on Saturday.
Duplantis bettered his previous mark of 6.23 metres set at the Eugene Diamond League finale in September, clearing the bar with ease before leaping up off the sponge mat below and racing off in celebration at his first outdoor event of the year. 
It was the eighth time that Duplantis broke the world record and the 24-year-old, who was the only man to clear six metres at the Egret Stadium, said he could do even better. 
“It’s definitely possible, conditions willing. I’m going to try to maximise the most out of every day,” Duplantis said. “There’s definitely more to give. I don’t think the jumping was really perfect today even leading up to the 6.24. The 6.24 felt really nice. I think there’s still some way to go and still more to push and some higher heights in me for sure.” 
The Olympic and two-time world outdoor champion had added a second world indoor title to his impressive resume in March, and he is set to head into his second Games in July and August as the firm favourite. 
American Sam Hendricks, who finished second with a best of 5.82m, a massive 42 centimetres adrift, heaped praise on the Louisiana-born Duplantis. 
“He’s got God’s hand on his back,” Hendricks said. “I’ve been a champion before. ‘Mondo’ has been my vice-champion. I’ve seen him from [when he was] a 14-year-old come all the way up. I’m ever joyous to be second behind a world record-holder. I know he works so hard. He goes all over the place and he’s becoming the true champion we all want him to be.” 
In the women’s 200m Australian Torrie Lewis enjoyed a stunning Diamond League debut, as the 19-year-old beat a strong field of American rivals that included Sha’Carri Richardson to claim gold with an effort of 22.96 from lane nine. 
Richardson, winner of the 200m bronze at last year’s world championships, finished second in 22.99 ahead of her compatriots Tamara Clark, Anavia Battle and Twanisha Terry. 
Lewis said she was shocked, not having expected to win against a high-calibre field. 
“No, not at all! My goal was honestly just to hold on as long as I could. I was in lane nine so I knew they’d all be chasing me,” Lewis said. 
World champion Marileidy Paulino earlier captured the first track gold of the Diamond League season in the women’s 400m as the Dominican eased home in 50.08 seconds ahead of Natalia Kaczmarek (50.29) and Britton Wilson (51.26). 
Olympic champion Jasmine Camacho-Quinn then set the pace in the women’s 100m hurdles, the Puerto Rican cruising to victory in 12.45 seconds. Tobi Amusan of Nigeria, the world-record holder in the event, only managed fifth place in 12.58 seconds. 
In the men’s 100m event Christian Coleman began his Diamond League title defence with a solid sprint of 10.13 seconds to beat fellow American Fred Kerley who came in at 10.17. 
Gudaf Tsegay won the women’s 1500m in 3:50.30 — the third-fastest time ever behind Kenyan Faith Kipyegon’s world record 3:49.11 and Ethiopian Genzebe Dibaba’s 3:50.07 — while Canada’s Marco Arop claimed the men’s 800m in a rapid 1:43.61. 
In the field, American Shelby McEwen claimed victory with a best of 2.27m ahead of Qatar’s Mutaz Essa Barshim in the men’s high jump and Cuban-born Portuguese Pedro Pichardo won the men’s triple jump with 17.51m. 
China had one winner in the shape of Olympic champion Lijao Gong in the women’s shot put (19.72m), with local athletes having another chance to shine as the Diamond League moves on to Suzhou next weekend.
