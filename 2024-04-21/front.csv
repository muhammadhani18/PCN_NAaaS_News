0,"US House passes $95 billion Ukraine, Israel aid package, sends to Senate",Senate set to consider bill next week.,"The US House of Representatives on Saturday with broad bipartisan support passed a $95 billion legislative package providing security assistance to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, over bitter objections from Republican hardliners.
The legislation now proceeds to the Democratic-majority Senate, which passed a similar measure more than two months ago. US leaders from Democratic President Joe Biden to top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell had been urging embattled Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to bring it up for a vote.
The Senate is set to begin considering the House-passed bill on Tuesday, with some preliminary votes that afternoon. Final passage was expected sometime next week, which would clear the way for Biden to sign it into law.
The bills provide $60.84 billion to address the conflict in Ukraine, including $23 billion to replenish US weapons, stocks, and facilities; $26 billion for Israel, including $9.1 billion for humanitarian needs, and $8.12 billion for the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed his thanks, saying US lawmakers moved to keep ""history on the right track.""
""The vital US aid bill passed today by the House will keep the war from expanding, save thousands and thousands of lives, and help both of our nations to become stronger,"" Zelenskiy said on X.
The Biden administration is already finalizing its next assistance package for Ukraine so it can announce the new tranche of aid soon after the bill becomes law in order to meet Ukraine’s urgent battlefield needs, a White House official said.
It was unclear how quickly the new military funding for Ukraine will be depleted, likely causing calls for further action by Congress.
Biden, who had urged Congress since last year to approve the additional aid to Ukraine, said in a statement: ""It comes at a moment of grave urgency, with Israel facing unprecedented attacks from Iran and Ukraine under continued bombardment from Russia.""
The vote on passage of the Ukraine funding was 311-112. Significantly, 112 Republicans opposed the legislation, with only 101 in support.
""Mike Johnson is a lame duck ... he's done,"" far-right Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene told reporters afterward.
She has been a leading opponent of helping Ukraine in its war against Russia and has taken steps that threaten to remove Johnson from office over this issue. Greene stopped short of doing so on Saturday, however.
During the vote, several lawmakers waved small Ukrainian flags as it became clear that an element of the package was headed to passage. Johnson warned lawmakers that was a ""violation of decorum.""
Meanwhile, the House's actions during a rare Saturday session put on display some cracks in what generally is solid support for Israel within Congress. Recent months have seen progressive Democrats express anger with Israel's government and its conduct of the war in Gaza.
Saturday's vote, in which the Israel aid was passed 366-58, had 37 Democrats and 21 Republicans in opposition.
Passage of the long-awaited legislation was closely watched by US defense contractors, who could be in line for huge contracts to supply equipment for Ukraine and other US partners.
Johnson this week chose to ignore ouster threats by hardline members of his fractious 218-213 majority and push forward the measure that includes Ukraine funding as it struggles to fight off a two-year Russian invasion. 
The unusual four-bill package also includes a measure that includes a threat to ban the Chinese-owned social media app TikTok and the potential transfer of seized Russian assets to Ukraine.
Some hardline Republicans voicing strong opposition to further Ukraine aid argued the United States can ill afford it given its rising $34 trillion national debt. They have repeatedly raised the threat of ousting Johnson, who became speaker in October after his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, was ousted by party hardliners.
""It's not the perfect legislation, it's not the legislation that we would write if Republicans were in charge of both the House, the Senate, and the White House,"" Johnson told reporters on Friday. ""This is the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances to take care of these really important obligations.""
Representative Bob Good, chair of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, told reporters on Friday that the bills represent a ""slide down into the abyss of greater fiscal crisis and America-last policies that reflect Biden and (Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck) Schumer and (House Democratic leader Hakeem) Jeffries, and don't reflect the American people.""
But Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who carries huge influence in the party, on April 12 voiced support for Johnson and in a Thursday social media post said Ukraine's survival is important for the US.

1,PML-N wins lion’s share in by-elections,"Ruling party sweeps Punjab; PTI loses in Bajaur, Gujrat; triumphs in DG Khan","As opposed to the shocking victory of the opposition in the general elections, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had a smooth sailing in the by-elections, as the unofficial results showed that it secured majority of seats of the national and provincial assemblies contested on Sunday.
In fact, the initial results sent shockwaves to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leadership as it had to face two major upsets in the by-elections in Bajaur, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in Gujrat in Punjab.
Independent candidate Mubarak Zeb won both national and provincial assembly seats in Bajaur. Mubarak Zeb is the brother of late Rehan Zeb, also an independent whose murder before the general elections led to the postponement of the election in the constituency.
In Gujrat, meanwhile, Moosa Elahi made history by defeating incarcerated Parvez Elahi, a senior PTI leader and former Punjab chief minister. The unofficial results showed that PML-N’s Ali Pervez Malik won in NA-119, Rasheed Ahmed Khan in NA-143, Adnan Afzal Chattha in PP-36, Muhammad Riaz in PP-147, Ali Ahmed Khan Leghari in PP-290, Chaudhry Muhammad Nawaz in PP-158, Rana Afzaal Hussain in PP-139, Rashid Minhas in PP-164, Saeed Akbar Khan in PP-93, and Ahmed Iqbal Chaudhry in PP-54.
Amid security threats, suspension of mobile and internet services in specific areas and the PTI’s allegations of rigging, the PML-N candidates secured victory on the seats which were vacated by its leaders.
Just like the general elections, the PTI was once again hoping that people would come out to vote for it in the name of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan but apparently it didn’t happen. Despite winning seats in Kohat and Dera Ghazi Khan, PTI leadership claimed that by-polls were rigged.
The by-elections were held on five National Assembly and 16 provincial assembly seats. The contested National Assembly seats were NA-8, Bajaur; NA-44, Dera Ismail Khan; NA-119, Lahore; NA-132, Kasur; and NA-196, Qamber Shahdadkot.
Similarly, the contested provincial assembly seats were PK-22; Bajaur; PK-91, Kohat; PB-20, Khuzdar; PB-22, Lasbella; PP-22, Chakwal-cum-Talagang; PP-32, Gujrat; PP-36, Wazirabad; PP-54, Narowal; PP-93, Bhakkar; PP-139, Sheikhupura; PP-266, Rahim Yar Khan; PP-290, Dera Ghazi Khan and four constituencies in Lahore – PP-147, PP-149, PP-158, and PP-164.

The polling began at 8am and concluded at 5pm, following which the vote counting began. Just like general elections, when mobile and internet services were shut down due to security reasons, cellular services were also suspended temporarily in specific districts of Punjab and Balochistan on Sunday.
A day ago, it was reported, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) had announced that “cellular services will be temporarily suspended during the by-elections on Sunday and Monday April 22 (today).
The PTA had said that the decision to suspend the cellular services in the areas, where voting would take place, was taken on the directives of the interior ministry to “safeguard the integrity and security of the electoral process”.
The National Assembly seats were vacated by political heavyweights like incumbent Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
The by-election in Bajaur took place because the voting postponed there after a candidate, Rehan Zeb, was murdered, during the campaigning for the general election held on February 8, according to the ECP officials. The election in Kohat was also postponed because of the death of a candidate.
Shehbaz and Bilawal had vacated one of the two National Assembly seats they had won in February 8 elections. Maryam and Gandapur had given up their National Assembly seats to retain their provincial assembly seats.
The ECP had issued election schedule for a total of National Assembly six seats, 12 of Punjab Assembly, two each of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Balochistan and one seat of the Sindh assembly. In NA-207, Nawabshah, vacated by Asif Zardari after his election as the president, Aseefa Bhutto Zardari, had already won unopposed.

The ECP stated that a total of 239 candidates contested the by-elections, including 50 for the National Assembly seats. Besides 154 candidates were contesting in Punjab, 23 in K-P and 12 in Balochistan, while Zubair Ahmed Junejo was elected unopposed in PP-80, Dadu seat.
The elections dotted with sporadic clashes at from various polling stations. The worst incident took place in Narowal where a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) worker, Muhammad Yousaf, 60, died during clash with the supporters of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
During the clash, it was reported, Yousaf was hit in the head with a stick and, despite being rushed to a local hospital, he could not survive and succumbed to his injuries. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar strongly condemned Yousaf’s killing, saying he was a senior worker of the PML-N.
Apart from the security challenges, the polling was held amid allegations of pre-poll manipulation and suspension of cellular services. To avoid any controversy, the Election Commission of Pakistan had instructed the election staff to ensure that Form 45 was handed over to all polling agents.
In a statement, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja also urged the contesting candidates to ensure that their polling agents collected the Form 45 from the presiding officers before leaving the polling stations.
The ECP said that CEC had sought reports from the provincial chief secretaries about the day-long election process and inquired about electioneering activities. The CEC also directed the commissioners and deputy commissioners concerned, to guarantee transparent elections.
Meanwhile, the ECP said, the CEC sought a report from the inspector general of Balochistan police regarding the intrusion of armed individuals into a polling station of PB-50 Qilla Abdullah and ordered strict action against the perpetrators.
The statement said that a report was sought from the Balochistan provincial election commissioner and the deputy commissioner of Qilla Abdullah regarding the reported abduction of polling staff in the same constituency.
The ECP said that the DC of Qila Abdullah had verbally informed that no abduction of polling staff occurred in the district.
The ECP added that a written report was sought in this regard to give a decision on the complaints.
The ECP further said in its statement that the CEC had also contacted the district police officer of Narwal and ordered him to submit a report on the death of a PML-N worker. It added that the CEC ordered strict action against those responsible.
The results for the PTI were mixed in K-P where the provincially-ruling party grabbed two of the four seats. The Bajaur district, where independent Mubarak Zeb won both the national and provincial assembly seats, would have to vacate one of them.
The PTI’s candidates contested the elections from the platform of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) in the province. It retained the Dera Ismail Khan seat, which was vacated by Chief Minister Gandapur. The SIC also won the contest in Kohat.

3,Iranian president to touch down in Islamabad today,"Visit, scheduled before recent Iran-Israel tensions, intends to repair ties with Pakistan","Iranian President Dr Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi is arriving here on Monday (today) on a visit that will be closely watched by the outside world against the backdrop of Tehran's ongoing tensions with Israel.
Despite the storm clouds brewing in the region, the president of Iran has decided to travel to Pakistan, suggesting the importance Tehran attaches its ties with Islamabad.
The visit was scheduled before the recent tensions between Iran and Israel and was intended as part of efforts to mend relations with Pakistan, which had been strained by tit-for-tat missile strikes in January.
The FO on Sunday confirmed the visit of the Iranian president.
""President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Dr. Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi will undertake an official visit to Pakistan from 22 to 24 April 2024. This will be the first visit by any Head of State to Pakistan after the general elections in February 2024,"" read a statement issued here by the foreign office.
It said the Iranian president will be accompanied by his spouse and a high-level delegation comprising the foreign minister and other members of the cabinet, senior officials as well as a large business delegation.
President Raisi's itinerary includes meetings with the president, prime minister, chairman Senate, and speaker of the National Assembly. Further, he will tour Lahore and Karachi, engaging with provincial leadership during his visit.
The two sides will have a wide-ranging agenda to further strengthen Pakistan-Iran ties and enhance cooperation in diverse fields including trade, connectivity, energy, agriculture, and people-to-people contacts. They will also discuss regional and global developments and bilateral cooperation to combat the common threat of terrorism.
""Pakistan and Iran enjoy strong bilateral ties anchored in history, culture and religion. This visit provides an important opportunity to further strengthen Pakistan-Iran relations,"" Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch remarked.
It is believed that the US is displeased with the Iranian president's visit, given its current efforts to isolate Tehran.
Despite this, Pakistan held its ground against pressure and informed the US that the scheduled visit had been arranged well in advance of the current tensions in the region.
Just days before the Iranian President, the US imposed sanctions on four firms including three Chinese companies for allegedly aiding Pakistan's ballistic and long-range missile program, a move some observers interpret as a signal to Islamabad amid its hosting of the Iranian President.In recent weeks, Pakistan has expressed interest in initiating work on the long-delayed Iran gas pipeline project. However, the US issued a warning, cautioning that Pakistan's decision could trigger sanctions.
Pakistan has often tried to tread a careful path in maintaining ties with Iran and Saudi Arabia.
However, officials here feel that this time Saudis don't have much reservations given their own relationship with Iran improved in recent months.
In March last year, China brokered a deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia to restore their diplomatic ties. Since then both countries reopened their diplomatic missions in each other’s capitals.
