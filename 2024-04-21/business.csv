0,Rising food exports fuel inflation,Non-textile exports up 10.87pc in eight months.,"ISLAMABAD: Raw food exports continued to expand in March, with a 16.35 per cent increase to $685.03 million, up from $588.76m in the same month last year, forcing local consumers to pay higher prices across the country. 
With this upward trend, raw food exports have climbed for the eighth consecutive month this fiscal year, despite the country’s highest food inflation in history, according to data compiled by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. 
The commerce ministry lifted the ban on onion exports following Eidul Fitr, despite the fact that the average onion price per kg is more than Rs200. Demand for Pakistani onions has increased as a result of the Indian government’s ban on onion exports to protect the interests of domestic consumers. 
These unchecked exports drove food inflation to a stunning 16.6pc in March as prices rose, limiting cash-starved people’s access to key goods such as wheat flour, rice, onions, sugar, meat, and vegetables.

Non-textile exports up 10.87pc in eight months

The new fiscal year began with a negative growth of 7.56pc in the export of raw food products, but it improved to positive growth of 4.07pc in August, while export proceeds grew further by 60.89pc in September, 59.90pc in October, 60.65pc in November, 111.63pc in December, 105.29pc in January, and 35pc in February. 
Analysts say the surge in food exports can be attributed to the unprecedented rupee depreciation. In addition, persistent disruptions in the supply chain and higher prices in the international market have led to soaring demand for food products. 
The overall exports of raw food products and non-textile value-added products witnessed a growth of 22.4pc in the first nine months of the current fiscal year to $10.49 billion, up from $8.57bn over the corresponding months of last year.
The PBS data showed the country’s rice exports rose by 83.37pc in July-March FY24 led by basmati rice, which had been falling since last year. India’s decision to impose a ban on rice exports to protect the interest of domestic consumers has emerged as a key driver behind the surge in basmati rice exports from Pakistan. 
The export of basmati rice experienced a notable surge of 36.37pc, reaching $622.34m in July-March FY24 from $456.36m in the corresponding period last year. 
The export of non-basmati rice rose by 102.15pc to $2.31bn in July-March 2023-24 from $1.14m in the same period last year. 
Due to a sustained surge in export figures over the past two years, the average price of basmati rice has surged to Rs400 per kg from Rs150, restricting buying from domestic consumers.
Pakistan exported $386.93m worth of meat in 9MFY24, up from $301.72m over the same period last year, showing a growth of 28.14pc. The reason for the increase in meat exports is the introduction of new markets like Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf nations, Malaysia, and Uzbekistan. 
Furthermore, one meat exporting company was granted market access for heat-treated meat shipments to China. 
Prices of meat in the domestic market have experienced an unparalleled surge in recent years. In two and a half years, the average price of buffalo meat has jumped from Rs700 per kg to Rs1,300. This increase has caught the attention of market observers and stakeholders alike. The price of chicken has also experienced an unprecedented surge, reaching its highest level over the last two years.
The export of all other food products saw an increase of 21.21pc to $876.65m in 9MFY24 from $723.55m in the corresponding months last year. The export of vegetables reached $336.28m against $235.51m over, an increase of 42.79pc. 
Fruits’ exports saw a growth of 17.34pc to $265.65m in 8MFY24 against $226.38m over the corresponding months last year.
On the other hand, Pakistan imported 691,192 tonnes of wheat in March, up 110.42pc from 328,453 tonnes over the corresponding month last year. The country began importing wheat in September 2023 despite the government’s claims of having a bumper wheat crop.
In nine months, the import bill of tea reached $495.22m this year, up 13.86pc from $434.94m over the same period last year.
Non-textile value-added products
The export of engineering goods saw an increase of 10.87pc in 8MFY24 from a year ago. The export of these commodities revived in March, while a few other commodities also saw an increase.
In 9MFY24, the export of footwear dropped 11.30pc and leather garments by 7.21pc year-on-year in July-March FY24. The decline was also observed in leather gloves. The exports of raw leather also decreased by 20.55pc during the period under review.
The export of surgical instruments also saw a decline of 1.36pc during the months under review. The export of carpets and rugs declined by 21.16pc in 9MFY24. The export of sports goods also declined 6.03pc. The export of gur products (which are not classified under the food category) saw an increase of 19.69pc in 9MFY24 from a year ago.
The export of jewellery surged by 22.74pc in 9MFY24, followed by a 4.75pc rise in the export of electric fans. However, the export of gems declined by 7.96pc, furniture 37pc, and handicrafts 68.37pc. Contrary to a slump in FY23, the cement exports jumped 32.51pc in 9MFY24.

1,"Gold rates surge above Rs252,000 after $11 jump in international market",Chairman of All Pakistan Jewellers Manufacturers Association says markets deserted after Eid despite start of marriage season.,"KARACHI: The 10 gram and one tola gold rates climbed to an all-time high of Rs216,221 and Rs252,200 on Saturday — up by Rs1,286 and Rs1,500 on the Friday figures.
As per rates issued by All Sindh Saraf Jewellers Association (ASSJA), gold rates surged on Saturday due to an $11 per ounce rise in the international market which took the price to $2,411.
The last all-time high prices of gold rates were recorded on April 17 when the 10 grams and one tola rates stood at Rs215,964 and Rs251,900, respectively .
The previous day’s rates were Rs1,887 and RS2,200.  The jump was attributed to a $30 per ounce rise in international gold rate to $2,412.
Mohammad Arshad, the Chairman of All Pakistan Jewellers Manufacturers Association (APJMA), said gold markets had been wearing a deserted look after Eidul Fitr despite the start of the marriage season as prices   have gone beyond the reach of most buyers.
He said the high gold rate is forcing more and more people towards silver and artificial jewellery, whose prices are also crawling up due to soaring demand.
“Our workers in the gold jewellery manufacturing units are worried about the dearth of new orders as customers are reluctant to visit shops due to prohibitive prices,” he said.
Qasim Shikarpuri, Chairman of Karachi Bullion Exchange (KBE), said the rates issued by ASSJA were not realistic and the actual sale/purchase of the yellow metal is between Rs242,000 and Rs243,000 per tola instead of Rs252,200.
He said a similar situation existed in the country’s north where customers are being charged rates which are lower than ASSJA rates.
“We are making efforts to work out realistic rates from the KBE platform. These prices can be applied all over the country,” he said.
On Jan 1, the 10 gram and one tola rates were Rs188,357 and Rs219,700, respectively, based on the world market rate of $2,082 per ounce.
This means the 10 gram and one tola rates have risen by Rs27,864 and Rs32,500, respectively, since the start of the new year.
No change in the rupee-dollar parity has been seen during this period.
According to data compiled by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the country’s gold import during 9MFY24 plunged to 262kg ($17 million) from 384kg  ($23.4m) in the same period of the last fiscal.

2,Elon Musk postpones India trip due to ‘Tesla obligations’,"NEW DELHI: Tech billionaire Elon Musk announced on Saturday he was postponing his visit to India, during which the...","NEW DELHI: Tech billionaire Elon Musk announced on Saturday he was postponing his visit to India, during which the Tesla boss was meant to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and discuss big investment plans.
The news came a day after Musk’s electric car company announced the recall of nearly 4,000 Cybertruck vehicles owing to an acceleration pedal defect that increased crash risks.
“Unfortunately, very heavy Tesla obligations require that the visit to India be delayed, but I do very much look forward to visiting later this year,” he said in a post on his social media platform X.
Media reports had suggested the trip would begin as soon as Sunday and last two days, during which Musk would meet with Modi and aerospace companies.
Tesla was reported to be scouting factory locations in India after the government last month cut import taxes on electric vehicles for global automakers that committed to invest $500 million and to start local production within three years.
The policy also allows companies to import up to 8,000 electric vehicles priced at $35,000 or higher every year with greatly reduced import duties.
Indian media reported that Tesla might first import cars from its Berlin factory until it makes a final decision on where to set up a production line.
Experts say it’s unlikely the Indian market will be an immediate shot in the arm for the company, mostly due to the high price tag of its cars.
Tesla’s cheapest model now is the Model 3 sedan, which retails for around $39,000 in the United States.

3,NBFIs lose ground amid lack of financing by banks,"According to bankers, this negative trend has serious consequences for the NBFIs.","KARACHI: Non-banking fina­n­cial institutions (NBFIs) are in distress amid a slump in financing from banks during the current financial year (FY24).
At the end of the third quarter of FY24, the NBFIs failed to get financing from banks and noted a net debt retirement of Rs93 billion. During the same period of last year the situation was opposite as the NBFIs had received Rs140bn.
According to bankers, this negative trend has serious consequences for the NBFIs and some of them are even considering closing down their operations. The main reason for this negative trend is that a record high interest rate has already increased the default rates for banks. 
It happened as most banks are reluctant to finance the private sector and prefer to park their liquidity in government bonds. 
It has created serious imbalances for the economy, causing a sharp decline in growth in almost all sectors of the economy. The economic growth fell to negative in FY23 and now the IMF estimates the growth rate for FY24 at two per cent. 
Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) or institutions are established to carry out activities like investment finance services, leasing, housing finance services, venture capital investment, discount services and investment advisory.
Pakistan has a bank-centric financial system where the share of NBFIs remains small and its contribution to financial intermediation is relatively limited.
However, the high interest rate has discouraged NBFIs from bank borrowing either for investment or any kind of venture. The CY22 was productive for NBFIs, but the fiscal year FY23 was problematic.
The sector is in growth phase in Pakistan and during CY22 it witnessed acceleration in its growth trajectory. The NBFI sector’s asset base grew by 26.7 per cent during CY22 (compared to 19 per cent in CY21) on the back of an impressive growth demonstrated by the asset management segment, particularly mutual funds and REITs.
However, the NBFIs showed accelerated growth during CY22, mainly driven by mutual funds which comprise the major chunk of the sector’s assets, while Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) also saw a significant activity.
Historic low
The real estate business has gone down to a historic low in FY24, ultimately hitting the construction industry and forcing the allied 42 segments of the economy to remain out of the growth process or register failure.
While a number of analysts believe that the next monetary policy scheduled for April 29 would be announced with reduced interest rate, some believe the interest rate would remain unchanged. Other analysts believe that even one or two per cent cut in the interest rate would not be enough to stimulate the economy.

4,China’s imports of Russian oil near record high in March,"Russia was China’s top supplier throughout 2023, shipping 2.14m bpd despite Western sanctions.","BEIJING: Russia remained China’s top oil supplier in March, data showed on Saturday, as refiners snapped up stranded Sokol shipments. 
China’s imports from Russia, including supplies via pipelines and sea-borne shipments, jumped 12.5 per cent on the year to 10.81 million tonnes, or 2.55 million barrels per day (bpd) last month, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. 
That was quite close to the previous monthly record of 2.56m bpd in June 2023. Seven Russian tankers under sanctions offloaded Sokol cargoes in Chinese ports in March, as Russia worked to clear a glut of stranded supply in the wake of tightened US sanctions. More than 10m barrels of the oil supplied by Sakhalin-1, a unit of Rosneft, had been floating in storage over the past three months amid payment difficulties and sanctions on shipping firms and vessels carrying the crude. 
Stockpiling of Russian crude for storage in strategic reserves by state-owned CNOOC also boosted imports from Russia. Data from consultancy Kpler forecast sea-borne shipments from Russia hitting a record high of 1.82m bpd, including 440,000 bpd of Sokol and 967,000 of ESPO. 
Russia was China’s top supplier throughout 2023, shipping 2.14m bpd despite Western sanctions and a price cap following the Kremlin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In coordination with other Opec+ members, Russia opted to roll forward a voluntary reduction in crude oil output of 300,000 bpd into the first quarter of the year to support energy prices. 
Imports from Saudi Arabia, previously China’s largest supplier, totalled 6.3m tonnes in March, or 1.48m bpd, down 29.3pc on the same period last year. Riyadh has said it would extend its voluntary cut of 1m bpd through the end of June, leaving its output at around 9m bpd.
The world’s top exporter kept the March official selling price of its flagship Arab Light to Asia at $1.50 over the Oman/Dubai average as the kingdom sought to secure market share. 
January-March imports from Malaysia, a trans-shipment point for sanctioned cargoes from Iran and Venezuela, soared 39.2pc on the year to 13.7m tonnes, or 3.23m bpd.

5,Russia warns of rice import ban over safety concerns,The FSVPS asks the plenipotentiary and trade representative at the Pakistani embassy in Russia for an immediate investigation into the matter.,"ISLAMABAD: Russia has warned Pakistan that it will ban rice imports again if their phytosanitary concerns are not addressed in future consignments. 
The Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (FSVPS) of the Russian Federation issued a notification regarding violations of international and Russian phytosanitary requirements over a shipment of rice imported from Pakistan. 
The notification, numbered FS-SA-3/6592 and dated April 2, 2024, highlights the presence of a quarantine organism, “Megaselia scalaris (Loew),” in the rice consignment. 
The FSVPS has asked the plenipotentiary and trade representative at the Pakistani embassy in Russia for an immediate investigation into the matter. 
A copy of the notice issued by the Russian authorities shows that the FSVPS has asked the relevant official in the Pakistani embassy to prevent such violations in the future and emphasised the importance of adhering to phytosanitary standards to ensure the safety of agricultural products traded between countries.
Meanwhile, the trade wing of Pakistani embassy in Moscow has forwarded the English translation of the Russian authority’s letter to the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) in the Ministry of Food Security and other relevant government offices.
The letter by the embassy to the DPP states, “In view of the above, it is requested that an investigation may be conducted immediately and the results of the investigation may please be shared with FSVPS in order to avoid any possible ban on rice exports in the future.” 
Meanwhile, the FSVPS has also sent an official communication to the director of DPP, seeking a higher degree of cooperation in the field of plant quarantine.
Russia had previously imposed a ban on similar grounds in 2019, which remained in place for around two years. It was lifted after a series of negotiations between officials of both sides. Earlier, in December 2006, Russia also stopped the import of rice from Pakistan for not meeting food safety standards.

6,Balochistan sets same wheat price as Sindh to curb smuggling,The chief minister forms a monitoring committee comprising members of the assembly to ensure transparency in the procurement process.,"QUETTA: The Balochistan cabinet has decided to fix the wheat support price equal to that in Sindh to curb smuggling.
The decision was made on Saturday during a cabinet meeting, which also approved the procurement of 500,000 tonnes of wheat this year.
The meeting, presided over by Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, was told that the decision to fix the support price same as Sindh was to stop the interprovincial movement of the grain due to price difference.
Last month, the Sindh government fixed the wheat support price at Rs4,000 per 40kg.
The Balochistan cabinet also changed the procurement method for wheat and issued orders to purchase customised, modern and eco-friendly bags for wheat.
The chief minister formed a monitoring committee comprising members of the assembly to ensure transparency in the procurement process.
Other government officials will also be included in the committee.
It was also decided that the provincial government will not provide bardana (bags) to the growers starting next year. Instead, the food department will pay farmers to buy them from the market.
Secretary Food Saleh Baloch informed the meeting that around 58,000 bags were currently available with the department while a tender has been invited to purchase more bags.
The secretary was ordered to cancel the tender and purchase standard bags available in the market.
The procurement will be done on a first come first served basis and only at approved centres “without any discrimination,” the cabinet decided.
While addressing his ministers and other officials, Chief Minister Bugti expressed his displeasure over the allegations of corruption in the purchasing and distribution of bags.
He said the malpractice was “not hidden from anyone”.
CM Bugti ordered the authorities to ensure transparency in the distribution of bags and warned any process involving partiality and favouritism would not be tolerated.
He stressed the need to eliminate corruption from the food department.
