0,"PTI, govt spar over EU letter",PTI denies plot to undermine GSP+ status,"The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has strongly refuted allegations made by Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, dismissing them as a concoction of falsehoods, rhetoric, and baseless accusations.
Reacting vehemently to the information minister's press conference, a PTI spokesperson categorically denied any suggestion that the party had corresponded with the European Union (EU) to advocate for the revocation of Pakistan's Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) status.
The spokesperson clarified that neither had PTI written any such communication nor harboured any intention to do so, dismissing the information minister's assertions as a mere amalgam of deceitful claims and unfounded allegations.
Highlighting PTI's and its founding chairman Imran Khan's endeavours towards the successful implementation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, despite facing numerous adversities, the spokesperson recalled the incompetence of former finance minister Ishaq Dar.
He pointed out that Dar’s obstinacy in causing delays in program completion was a fact also acknowledged by PML-N ministers themselves.
The spokesperson emphasised that following approval from Imran Khan and PTI, the IMF disbursed the program's second tranche, lamenting that individuals responsible for pushing the country to the brink of bankruptcy were once again imposed upon the nation against its will.
He criticised those who, despite allegedly usurping power through electoral fraud, now preached patriotism to others.
Asserting PTI's position as Pakistan's largest and most popular political party, representing all federating units, the spokesperson accused members of the Pakistan Democratic Movement-2 (PDM-2) of prioritising personal gain over national interests, labelling them as courtiers blinded by falsehoods disseminated through their fake ministries.

‘An attack on country’
Earlier, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar said attempts by PTI to ""get Pakistan's GDP+ status withdrawn were an ""attack"" on the country.
Tarar alleged that PTI's purported agenda aimed to jeopardise Pakistan's economy through a campaign founded upon falsehoods.
He further claimed that Imran Khan, currently incarcerated, was receiving preferential treatment, including access to amenities not offered to other prisoners, such as a personal kitchen, additional living space, and exercise facilities.
Addressing the media in Islamabad, the newly-appointed information minister maintained that Pakistan's GSP+ status would lead to reduced inflation and increased employment in the country.
Tarar maintained that certain politicians were trying to harm the country and its economy for the sake of their politics and added that no one would be allowed to disrupt the peace in Pakistan their plan would remain a ""delusion"".
Taking a jibe at the former ruling party, he stated that PTI’s attempt at gaining access to the European Union is ""heinous and sad"", adding that former premier Imran Khan wanted the nation to default as he wrote a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in this regard.
PM Shehbaz Sharif’s personal interest saved the country from default, the minister added.
“PTI founder was provided exercise equipment in the jail unlike others, the party is pushing a false narrative. You (PTI) put political interest first and ignored national interest,” said Tarar.
“I will try my best to take measures for the welfare of media workers and journalists, the doors of office are open for journalists, I will try to play the role of a bridge between the government and the media.”
The minister also urged media houses, newspapers and digital media platforms to jointly fulfil this responsibility.
He further said the government is taking steps to put the economy on the trajectory of development and address problems faced by the people including that of inflation, adding that initiatives are being taken from the platform of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) to bring improvement in the economy.
Tarar added that PM Shehbaz has started working on the challenges faced by the economy.
Pakistan's GSP+ status, conferred by the European Union in 2014, serves as a trade incentive promoting good governance and sustainable development by facilitating duty-free or minimum-duty exports to the European market. The status, extended until 2027, plays a vital role in fostering trade relations between Pakistan and the EU.

1,PHC weighs in on legal battle over reserved seats,AGP says SIC cannot get allocation because it did not contest Feb polls,"Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan informed a larger bench of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday that the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) did not contest the February 8 general elections, hence, it could not be allotted the reserved seats as per the law.
The bench, consisting of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, Justice Ijaz Anwar, Justice SM Atiq Shah, Justice Shakeel Ahmed, and Justice Syed Arshad Ali, heard a petition from the SIC regarding the allocation of reserved seats for women and minorities in the National Assembly and provincial legislatures.
The SIC had challenged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP)’s decision to not allocate reserved seats to them. During the hearing, Justice Ijaz Anwar remarked that the allocation of reserved seats in parliament resembled the distribution of spoils of war.
Representing the petitioner, Qazi Mohammad Anwar Advocate informed the court that senior lawyers Barrister Ali Zafar and Babar Awan would present arguments. Meanwhile, Anwar provided background information on the case.
Justice Ibrahim inquired whether any SIC candidate was successful in the February 8 election, to which Anwar replied in the negative. Justice Arshad noted that even the SIC chairman contested the election as an independent candidate.
Subsequently, the court directed AGP Awan to present his arguments. The AGP defended the ECP's decision, stating that the SIC had not submitted any list for the allocation of reserved seats before the election, which was a mandatory requirement under the law.
Responding to a query about redistributing the seats to other parties if not allocated to the SIC, the AGP asserted that parliament would be incomplete without the allocation of those seats, emphasizing the importance of representation for women and minorities.

Justice Ibrahim then asked whether the ECP had the authority to distribute those seats to other parties, to which the AGP answered in the affirmative. Justice Ijaz Anwar inquired why the SIC, being a recognized political party, could not be given the reserved seats.
The AGP explained that a political party was defined as one that had participated in the election and deserved reserved seats accordingly, citing Section 1 of Article 63A of the Constitution.
ECP lawyer Sikander Bashir Mohmand concurred with the AGP's arguments but expressed a desire to provide further arguments on certain points. He clarified that a political party must field candidates in the elections and submit Form 66 for reserved seats, which had not been done in this case.
Legal representatives for other parties, including Farooq H Naek for the PPP, Kamran Murtaza for the JUI-F, and Barrister Haris Azmat for the PML-N, also shared their perspectives on the matter. Azmat argued that the high court lacked jurisdiction, suggesting that the petitioner could approach the Supreme Court or the Islamabad High Court.
Later, the court adjourned the hearing till Thursday (today) and instructed the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Advocate General Shah Faisal that since he had been a lawyer in this case, therefore, he should hand over the case to another officer.
Separately, Justice Chaudhry Muhammad Iqbal of the Lahore High Court (LHC) turned down the SIC’s request for issuing a stay order against the allotment of reserved seats in light of the ECP new schedule and sought replies from the federal and provincial governments on the matter.
The SIC, joined by the PTI-backed independents, filed a petition in the LHC challenging the recent decision of the ECP to allocate reserved seats meant for it to other political parties. On the request for the stay order, Justice Iqbal emphasised that replies by the respondents should be submitted first.
In the petition, submitted through Chaudhry Ishtiaq A Khan, SIC Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza dubbed the ECP’s order unconstitutional and requested the court to suspend its operation. He also urged the court to restrain the respondents from taking oath until a final decision was reached.
The court sought replies from the federal and provincial governments on the next date of hearing.
Punjab Advocate General Khalid Ishaq argued that some lawmakers had already taken oath, hence the reply would be submitted to the extent of those who had not been sworn in yet.

2,Kabul seeks fresh start with Islamabad,Pakistan’s acting envoy to Kabul travelled to Kandahar earlier this week to meet senior aide of Taliban supreme leader,"The Afghan Taliban government has reached out to new government in Pakistan, seeking talks to resolve issues that have threatened to unravel their bilateral relationship, according to people familiar with the development.
Pakistan and Afghanistan have troubled relationship since months over the Taliban’s refusal to neutralise the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Tensions had been running high when Shehbaz Sharif was heading the PDM government before the elections.
Relationship dipped further under the caretaker setup as Pakistan during that period started evicting undocumented Afghans and tightened border controls besides making visa mandatory for travel between the two neighbours.
Pakistan virtually severed official contacts with the Taliban regime, though, both sides remained in touch informally. The visit of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman was part of informal channels to sort out differences between the two countries.
But following the election and formation of new government, the Taliban government wanted to reopen formal channel of communications with Pakistan.

For this purpose, Pakistan’s acting ambassador to Kabul Obaidur Rahman Nizamani travelled to Kandahar earlier this week to meet the senior aide of Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada.
Nizamani travelled out of Kabul for the first time since he survived an assassination attempt in the Afghan capital last year. Pakistan withdrew him and only sent him back after Taliban assured fool proof security to its chief diplomat in Afghanistan.
Nizamani held talks with Mullah Shirin Akhund, who is a governor of Kandahar and a close aide of the Taliban supreme leader. Shirin, an influential Taliban commander, was part of the Taliban government committee that facilitated talks between Pakistan and the TTP.
The media center office in Kandahar posted on its social media platform X that the meeting between Nizamani and Mullah Akhund took place on Monday, March 11 in Kandahar.
According to the Afghan media, Mullah Akhund congratulated the Chargé d’Affaires of the Pakistani embassy on the establishment of a new government in Pakistan during their meeting and expressed hope that the new Pakistani government would assist both Pakistan and Afghanistan, which are Islamic and neiguhboring countries.

The governor of Kandahar emphasised, “securing interests and creating a secure environment in the future and implementing programmes based on the policies of the two countries.”
Sources said the Taliban leader wanted the Pakistani envoy to deliver a message to the new government regarding the re-engagement between the two countries.
The Pakistani diplomat assured him that he would convey the message and for this purpose is expected to travel to Islamabad soon.
Sources said the Taliban government was keen to resolve all issues through dialogue. Kabul is still sticking with its stance that Pakistan has to find a way out of TTP problem through dialogue.
The interim government is also demanding from Pakistan to review its strategy expelling the undocumented Afghans as well as revisiting its decision of one document regime.
Prime Minister Shehbaz was already briefed by the foreign secretary on major challenges including relationship with Afghanistan.
The foreign office also informed that newly appointed Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar that the relationship with Afghanistan was on a shaky ground as Kabul was not ready to mend its ways as far as TTP was concerned.
However, foreign office believes that Pakistan must explore diplomatic options to break the impasse.
The prime minister will give the policy guidelines on foreign policy and relationship with Afghanistan after getting input from all the stakeholders.

3,"Govt aims to reduce pension, wage bill",PM tasks committee to propose measure in a week," 
The PML-N government has set up a new committee to cut its size and also rationalise the expenditure on pensions and development -- in a move that covers hardly 16% of this year’s budget and may not result in any major savings.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has not included the defence budget and expenditure on interest payments in the purview of the committee -- the two largest heads that consume nearly two-thirds of the total federal budget.
The premier has constituted the seven-member committee, comprising four bureaucrats and three independent experts, including Dr Kaiser Bengali, who has long been advocating for cutting the non-combatant military budget and closing the cantonments.
He has given the committee one week to make recommendations to reduce the federal government expenditure.
The committee has the mandate to review the pension schemes -an issue that is also now figuring on the agenda of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The global lender has listed the wage and pension bill of the government as an outstanding issue for discussions during its March 14-18 review talks.
The National Assembly has approved the Rs14.4 trillion budget for this fiscal year. Out of this total, the lion’s share—though still underscored—of Rs7.3 trillion was allocated for interest payments, with an additional Rs1.8 trillion earmarked for defence spending, excluding special programmes.
Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Dr Jehanzeb Khan, will serve as the chairman of the expenditure committee. The secretary of the cabinet division, the secretary of the finance division, and Rashid Mahmood Langrial, who serves as secretary of industry, are members representing the government side.
From the private sector, Dr Kaiser Bengali, a renowned economist, Dr Farrukh Saleem and Naveed Iftikhar are the members of the committee.
The committee has been mandated to take stock of all reports commissioned so far, including reports of the National Austerity Committee and the Institutional Reforms committed to reducing the size of the federal government.

There are about one and a half dozen federal ministries that are functioning despite these subjects having been devolved to the provinces.
The committee has been asked to capture all the progress made so far in downsizing the federal government. The committee will prepare a strategy and implementation plan for all remaining recommendations with timelines, according to the notification.
The government has allocated Rs714 billion for running the civil government in the budget, a sum that is less than 5% of the total budget.
The committee has been tasked to make recommendations related to the Public Sector Development Programme and the pension schemes. For this fiscal year, the National Assembly allocated Rs900 billion for the development and Rs801 billion for the pensions.
Out of Rs801 billion, the cost of military pensions is Rs563 billion or 70% of the allocation for the pensions.
The exclusion of the defence budget and the interest payments from the scope of the committee has left little space for making any meaningful impact.
The finance ministry last month upwardly revised the budget deficit target to Rs8.5 trillion, primarily because of an increase in estimates of interest payments during this fiscal year.
Interest expenses have now been estimated at Rs8.333 trillion, compared to the annual allocation of Rs7.3 trillion.
Pakistan needs debt restructuring and sharp cuts in the interest rates by the central bank to make noticeable cuts in expenditure.
During the first seven months of this fiscal year, the government spent Rs4.66 trillion on interest payments, a sum that was more than the federal government’s net income during this period.
Past austerity policies have not helped achieve fiscal consolidation, often being relaxed after their approval. The former interim premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar had also approved new fiscal austerity measures, including a ban on creating new positions and major purchases.
The government has already placed a complete ban on creating new posts under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) and the current budget for the fiscal year 2023-24.
There has already been a ban on the purchase of all vehicles except for ambulances, buses for educational institutions, solid waste vehicles, tractors, fire-fighting vehicles, and motorbikes, according to the decision.

4,Gandapur asks Shehbaz to engage with Imran,"Breaking the ice, PM allows K-P CM to meet with PTI’s founding chairman in jail","In an ice-breaking development, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) held a meeting with Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday in which he asked the prime minister to politically engage with his party’s founder Imran Khan.
Talking to reporters alongside Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal after the meeting at the Prime Minister House, Gandapur described his interaction with Shehbaz as “positive”. He said that he had requested the prime minister to lift the ban on visiting Imran and other prisoners in Adiala Jail.
Imran, a former prime minister, has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail over a host of charges ranging from corruption to terrorism. Earlier this week, the authorities placed a two-week ban on any visit to the PTI founder because of security concerns.
Gandapur said that he requested the prime minister to lift the ban on visiting Imran because he had to discuss the upcoming Senate elections with the PTI’s founder. He added that Shehbaz accepted his request and permitted him to meet with Imran in jail.
Gandapur said that during the meeting he asked Shehbaz Sharif – the president of the PTI’s main political rival Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) – to “politically engage” with Imran Khan. “Such an engagement [between Shehbaz and Imran] will lead to a political solution,” Gandapur told reporters.
“This was my first meeting with the prime minister. Talks were held with the prime minister on the law and order situation as well as other public issues. The prime minister has assured me that the federal government would fully cooperate with K-P on these matters,” he said.

The K-P chief minister added that Shehbaz had assured him that all the K-P’s dues would be cleared. “The prime minister has said that he would keep his promises. He also asked the officers to give us a timeline that was possible and what can be done within it.”
Speaking on the occasion, Iqbal also termed the talks between Prime Minister Shehbaz and the K-P chief minister positive, saying that Shehbaz had promised Gandapur that the province’s dues would be cleared by the federal government.
He said Prime Minister Shehbaz had directed the finance ministry to discuss the matter of dues with the officers of K-P. “After the end of the IMF [International Monetary Fund] negotiations, there will be a meeting on the dues with K-P on [March] 19th.”
Iqbal, who is also a senior leader of the PML-N, added that Prime Minister Shehbaz had also issued instructions to address the difficulties, including gas and power outages, faced by the people in K-P during “Sehr and Iftar times”.
The minister continued that the prime minister had ordered the formation of a joint team of the Centre and K-P to work with the federal government to resolve the issues of the province. “Everyone has their own politics, but the state belongs to all,” he remarked.
In the meeting that lasted for over an hour, Gandapur demanded the appointment of a new chief secretary in his province and the release of its funds. He told the prime minister that he wanted Shahab Ali Shah as the new K-P chief secretary.
The meeting between Shehbaz and Gandapur is being seen as an attempt at reconciliation between the top two political rivals in the country – the PML-N and PTI. Shehbaz and Gandapur also discussed other matters during the meeting as well.

5,Pakistan aims for large IMF loan,Finance czar says interest rates to come down,"Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday said that Pakistan was keen to sign a large International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and underscored the need for tackling the problems of low economic growth and high inflation through stabilisation policies.
The minister also said that the era of cash deposits by friendly countries and the rollovers of the external debt was over, and the country had to come out of the mindset of doing patchwork to deep-rooted economic problems.
In his first interaction with a group of journalists since taking oath as the minister, Aurangzeb indicated that the coalition government would not abandon the path to economic stabilisation and it stood ready to enforce the IMF prescription one more time.
“Macroeconomic stability needs permanency and for that Pakistan needs a large and longer duration IMF programme,” Aurangzeb said. However, he did not explain the duration of the programme and the actual size of the loan that Pakistan would be looking for its balance of payment support.
Aurangzeb’s statement came a day before an IMF team is scheduled to reach Pakistan for policy negotiations for the last loan tranche of $1.1 billion. The IMF team is arriving only for five days and the talks are expected to conclude on March 18th.
“We would be very keen to initiate discussions on the Extended Fund Facility [EFF] during the upcoming visit but the detailed discussions would take place during the spring meetings, said the minister, who would be traveling to Washington next month to attend annual IMF and World Bank meetings.
The finance minister said that there was a real sense of urgency and “we are in a good shape to complete this programme” and negotiate a new deal. He added that the government would also get the IMF assistance for the budget.
“I am quite positive that we are in a good stead to successfully conclude and complete the stipulations of the IMF for the second review, said Aurangzeb. He added that Pakistan would share a blueprint with the IMF on the new programme, but added that the discussions would take place in Washington.
The short duration of the IMF vision and the minister’s statement about finalising the new programme in Washington suggest that the upcoming IMF visit might only end in the announcement of a staff-level agreement for the completion of the second review of the current programme.
The Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal also said that the size of the loan programme was not final yet but Pakistan would be seeking a large programme. He added that the government was reviewing the possibility of taking an IMF environment facility, but added it would take time before it was matured.
“Pakistan’s last five finance ministers signed almost the same IMF programmes and until all those structural benchmarks are fully implemented, we would keep doing the same patchwork,” the finance minster added.
Inflation
Aurangzeb emphasised that a nuclear sovereign state “can no more run on a day-to-day patchwork”. He also said that the biggest problem was inflation but it could only be addressed through macroeconomic stability.
With the slowdown in the inflation rate, the interest rates would start reducing gradually from this fiscal year, he continued. But, he said, it was the prerogative of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to make such decisions. “It is difficult for the businesses to do business at the current rate [of 22%].”
He also underscored the importance of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) for bringing foreign investment. He said that the old global order of deposits and loan rollovers was over and “now even friendly countries are asking for equity investments and seats at the board of companies”.
The finance minister hoped that the after the finalisation of the new programme, the foreign commercial loans would begin. Yet, he remained sceptical about tapping the international capital markets.
He said that the 100 days agenda was not just the proverbial, as the government was serious in implementing the things on a priority basis. “There is no magic wand that can take directly to economic growth,” he said. “The past attempts to spur growth without deep-rooted stabilisation ended up at external sector crises.”
Tax reforms
Aurangzeb said that the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) reform would be implemented and the thrust would be an end-to-end digitisation for bringing transparency and ending leakages. He added that the data analytics teams, comprising young people would be placed in the FBR to maximise the usage of already available data of the taxpayers.
The FBR has long been claiming of having information about more than 52 million people, but this data has not been translated into taxes. The minister emphasized that the untaxed sectors like the wholesale, retail and agriculture had to be taxed, as there was a limit to putting more burden on the existing taxpayers.
Aurangzeb said that the salaried class was leaving the country and “we have to address the issue of the talent drain”. He added that the government would give a big push to the privatisation agenda and the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) privatisation process would be taken to the finishing line.
