3,Man held for killing wife in robbery drama,Couple was returning home from Arifwala after obtaining medicine,"An apparent robbery-turned-murder of a pregnant woman in Pakpattan has taken a twist as police uncovered the husband's involvement in the crime.
Taimur Taj, the husband of the victim, Sidra Bibi, initially reported to the police that his wife was shot and killed by three unidentified assailants during a robbery attempt near village 21 EB Morr on Hota Road. However, upon further investigation, the police arrested Taj himself on suspicion of foul play.
District Police Officer Captain (retd) Tariq Wilayat revealed that during interrogation, Taimur Taj confessed to orchestrating the entire incident, staging a robbery to cover up his wife's murder.
The couple was returning home from Arifwala after obtaining medicine.
The family of the deceased has condemned the heinous act, attributing it to a domestic dispute. They called for justice to be served swiftly and decisively.
In recognition of their efforts in solving the case, DPO Pakpattan has announced commendations for the police team involved, including DSP Arifwala Malik Tariq Javed Awan and SHO Police Station Saddar Chaudhry Muhammad Waqas.
Earlier in November last year, police arrested a man and his two accomplices over allegedly killing his wife.
Complainant Ijaz Khursheed informed police that his daughter, Ansa Khan, married Khawaja Faisal Mahmood in 2011.
She had borrowed Rs4 million and gave it to her husband, who used the money to buy a plot. However, when she demanded the money back, her husband allegedly tortured her and the couple used to quarrel over the issue.
On the night of November 2nd, the complainant stated that his son Ehtasham went to meet his sister, but neighbours informed him that she had died. He said that they immediately reached Nishtar Hospital, where doctors conducted a postmodern examination and it emerged that she was strangled to death.
Police reached the hospital and started investigations, while CPO Multan Mansoorul Haq Rana ordered police to arrest the accused.
Police arrested the main accused, Khawaja Faisal Mahmood and his accomplices, Muhammad Younis and Khadim Hussain.
The accused confessed to their involvement in the killing, citing the monetary dispute between the couple as the motive, police said.
Property disputes often turn deadly in Punjab.
In September, a man allegedly shot his sister and nephew dead over a property dispute in Pakpattan.

4,Price discrepancies mar open markets,"Consumers face inflated vegetable, fruit rates on first day of Ramazan","Despite the claims of stringent regulatory measures implemented by the district administration, consumers at open markets faced challenges in purchasing vegetable items at the prices listed by the market committee on the first day of Ramazan.
Sources revealed that vendors in surrounding areas seemed to evade legal consequences, leading to discrepancies in pricing.
The district administration had established two Ramadan cheap bazaars at Jhang Road and Behari Colony, where agriculture fair price shops were set up to provide vegetables at reasonable rates. However, despite efforts to enforce the price list issued by the market committee, consumers reported facing inflated prices in various localities.
For instance, while the market committee had fixed the price of onions at Rs225-232 per kilogramme, vendors in Peoples Colony were charging Rs300 for the same item.
Similarly, onions were being sold for Rs280-290 per kilogram in Jhang Bazar and adjacent areas, contrary to the committee's price of Rs225-232.
Muhammad Awais, spokesperson for the district administration, expressed dissatisfaction with the performance of price magistrates in ensuring compliance with regulations.
In a meeting prior to Ramazan, the deputy commissioner emphasised the need for rigorous inspections and warned of strict action against non-compliance.
