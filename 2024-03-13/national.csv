0,Socio-economic imbalances persist,"So far, 12 development plans have failed to remove structural bottlenecks","Though the country has formulated 12 socio-economic development plans since 1955, still it faces socio-economic imbalances and structural bottlenecks as the centre has failed to take provinces on board in the plan execution process.
The previous caretaker government, before its departure, approved the 13th socio-economic development plan with particular focus on 15 key areas of the economy to be executed by the new government. The 13th development plan, approved by the National Economic Council (NEC), particularly targets reforms in the energy sector by shifting focus from thermal to renewable energy and seeks investment in mineral exploration and processing.
Experts say Pakistan’s development plans have failed due to inconsistency of policies during every government’s tenure and ignoring the national economic agenda.
During discussions in a recent NEC meeting, it was informed that in light of Article 156(2) of the Constitution, the NEC was responsible to review the overall economic condition and advise federal and provincial governments to formulate plans in respect of financial, commercial, social and economic matters. While drawing up such plans, the NEC was required, among other factors, to ensure balanced development and regional equity.
It was observed that despite the above provision, seldom any advice was given by the NEC to provinces, which also never shared their Annual Development Plans (ADPs) with the NEC. 
NEC was briefed that over the past few decades, Pakistan had faced several internal and external challenges that hindered its ability to achieve high economic growth on a sustainable basis. “Long-term planning has generally been missing, while emerging challenges were also occasionally not envisioned or addressed. This has led to policy inconsistency.”
It was pointed out that high growth had remained episodic, with each period of high growth generally followed by a swift rise in external imbalances, leading to the adoption of adjustment policies, which then induced growth slowdown. “The challenge of rapidly growing population increases demand for schooling, shelter, healthcare, infrastructure and skills. On the other hand, inadequate resources limit the government’s ability to adequately invest in human capital.”
At the same time, the NEC was told, climate change was posing a serious threat to food security, while the volatile agrarian performance had negative externalities across other sectors, having a significant spillover impact. It was stated that the unsustainable growth pattern prevented the country from progressing adequately in areas of human and social development. Within provinces, many areas continued to feel deprived of gains that should have accrued to them from economic growth.
There is an urgent need to revamp the growth framework in a way that addresses the issues of low productivity and income, as well as regional inequalities, by making growth more balanced, inclusive, sustainable, and more reliant on indigenous resources rather than external inflows. The national imperatives and global developments necessitate a holistic approach to initiate drastic structural reforms for a transformational turnaround in the economy.
Since 1955, five-year plans have been the main tool for planning, strategising, and providing direction and focus to the economy.
The country’s first formal five-year plan was implemented from 1956-60 with agricultural development getting the highest priority.
Since then, the five-year plans up to 1993 prioritised industrial development and advancement (1961-65), private sector investment (1966-70), nationalisation of private business entities (1971-75), improving the standard of living of the poorest segments (1979-83), promoting private sector by tackling issues of low investment and saving ratios, low agricultural productivity, heavy reliance on imported energy, and low spending on health and education (1984-88), and private investment in all sectors of the economy (1989-93).
The tradition of five-year plan was abandoned with the eighth plan (1994-98), which was approved but could not be implemented.
The ninth plan (1999-2003) was also prepared but was not approved, while the 10th plan (2011-15) was prepared in 2010 but was replaced with the Framework for Economic Growth in 2011.
The 11th plan (2014-2018), approved in 2016, was a major step to actualise the Pakistan Vision 2025, a medium-term framework designed to address multiple challenges on economic, security and development fronts.
The 12th plan (2018-23) was approved with a focus on improving the fundamentals of economic growth and ensuring balanced regional development. However, it was not officially released. Now, the 13th Five-year Plan will be implemented from July 2024 to June 2029 and is being prepared in the backdrop of socio-economic imbalances and structural bottlenecks.

1,Illegal cigarette sales surge in south Punjab,"PTC says tax-evaded, smuggled cigarettes being sold openly","Pakistan Tobacco Company (PTC), while sharing latest market trends, has said that the sale of illicit (smuggled, tax-evaded and counterfeit) cigarettes has increased to around 60% in south Punjab, causing a loss of billions of rupees to the national exchequer.
Talking to media persons, PTC Business Development Analyst Mohsin Ali mentioned that south Punjab had been affected the most by tax-evaded and smuggled cigarette brands, which were being openly sold at retail outlets. After successive increases in excise duty, consumers have moved to cheaper, tax-evaded and smuggled cigarette options, which are illegal. The irony is that these cigarette brands are openly sold in the market as enforcement has not been able to create the desired level of deterrence.
A market survey of different areas in Multan clearly highlighted the growing trend of illicit cigarettes and how laws were being openly flouted. It is important to note that the government of Pakistan has set the minimum price of a pack of cigarettes at Rs127.44, which is not being enforced in true letter and spirit. A majority of cigarette brands are being sold at prices ranging from Rs80 to Rs130. It was also observed that a majority of the cigarettes being sold were without track and trace stamps. Smuggled cigarettes of various brands were also available, which were being sold without the graphical health warning.
“Illicit cigarette manufacturers are openly flouting rules and regulations through free cigarette packs and reward schemes among other activities,” said the PTC analyst. In order to curb the growing trend of illicit cigarettes, the PTC official emphasised, the government must sensitise its law enforcement agencies against the organised crime network and take strict action.

2,Pakistani firms showcase textile expertise,"Eighteen companies exhibit latest products, innovative technologies at Shanghai expos","Eighteen Pakistani textile companies made a strong impression at the Yarn Expo Spring 2024 and Intertextile Shanghai Apparel Fabrics-Spring Edition 2024, two of the world’s most influential textile and apparel exhibitions, held from March 6 to 8 March in Shanghai, China.
The Pakistani contingent, representing a diverse range of textile manufacturers and suppliers, showcased their latest products and innovative technologies, attracting significant interest from global buyers. Participating companies, spanning the yarn, fabric, finished goods segments and accessories, exhibited a wide array of high-quality products, including cotton, polyester, blended yarns, wool carpets and specialty fabrics. Pakistan’s textile industry has long been renowned for its quality, competitiveness and ability to meet the evolving demands of the global market.
Pakistan’s Consul General in Shanghai Hussain Haider, while talking to CEN at the expo, expressed his pride and optimism regarding the strong participation of Pakistani textile companies in the two major exhibitions. Highlighting the significance of the presence of the Pakistani textile industry at the expo, he stated that it was a testimony to the rich textile heritage of the country and its commitment to innovation and quality. “Pakistan’s textile industry has emerged as a leading exporter, generating $1.9 billion in monthly exports, consolidating its position as the largest industry in the country,” the consul general pointed out.
“Pakistani textiles are known for their competitive pricing, making them an attractive option for buyers seeking quality products at affordable prices. This competitiveness is backed by the country’s skilled workforce, efficient manufacturing processes, and strong supply chain network.”
He further spoke about the growing collaboration between Pakistan and China in textile trade, highlighting Chinese investment in Pakistan, the exchange of technological know-how and Pakistan’s intention to learn from China’s innovation and management skills. He also emphasised the potential application of artificial intelligence in the textile industry.
In addition, the consul general highlighted the role of exhibitions like Yarn Expo and Intertextile Shanghai in promoting trade and cooperation between Pakistan and China. He said that such platforms provide excellent opportunities for Pakistani companies to network with industry peers, explore business opportunities, learn new trends, expand exports and strengthen their global presence.
It is worth mentioning that many companies highlighted their eco-friendly manufacturing processes and commitment to sustainability, aligning with the global trend towards more environmentally conscious production by showcasing their sustainable products. Kohinoor Mills Ltd Marketing Manager Nadeem Waqar highlighted the need to adopt environmentally friendly manufacturing processes, use sustainable materials and reduce waste. He also stressed the importance of collaboration and partnership among industry players to achieve a more circular and sustainable textile economy.
With China announcing further measures to expand its imports and providing a significant boost to Pakistan’s textile exports, which now enjoy zero tariff treatment in line with China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement Phase 2, Mohsin Khan from Reliance Weaving Mills Ltd saw a significant opportunity for Pakistani textiles to capture a larger share of the market.

3,Railways’ revenue rises to Rs55b in 8 months,Earnings grow 49% despite financial crisis due to flood damage,"Pakistan Railways has earned Rs55 billion in the first eight months of the current financial year, despite facing a financial crisis due to floods in the monsoon season.
During the first eight months of the previous financial year, the department had earned Rs37 billion, displaying a historic increase of Rs18 billion, or 49%, in revenue in the current financial year ie, 2023-24, a railways ministry official told APP.
According to available data, the official said, the earnings of Rs55 billion so far in FY24 comprised revenue from passenger and freight trains, and other sectors of the department also made their contribution.
“The department is expecting to generate revenue up to Rs80 billion by the end of this financial year through consistent efforts and hard work of its workers,” he emphasised. At present, Pakistan Railways is operating 96 passenger trains, up from the previous year when 86 trains were running. Similarly, during the previous year, on average it operated 3.75 freight trains while the number reached seven freight trains this year.

The official revealed that the issue of delay in payment of salaries to employees had been resolved and things would be more streamlined once work on the Mainline-I (ML-I) project kicked off.
Owing to inflationary pressures, triggered by high fuel costs, Pakistan Railways has increased its fares, both for passenger and freight segments, which will help the cash-strapped organisation to fetch better revenue over the coming months.
Responding to a question, the ministry official said that Pakistan Railways had beefed up precautionary measures to reduce passenger train accidents and only six minor incidents with no casualty occurred across the country during the last three months. “Only two train accidents took place in September, no accident happened in October and four accidents occurred in November due to effective steps of the department.”
It came in the wake of efforts being undertaken to reduce trespassing at unmanned level crossings and unauthorised locations, he added.

4,"PSX slumps on rate, IMF review uncertainty","KSE-100 index dives 953.60 points, settles at 64,801.70","In a highly bearish session, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday slumped over 950 points as a host of factors such as a weakening rupee, uncertainty ahead of monetary policy announcement, high inflation and the upcoming International Monetary Fund (IMF) review dampened investors’ spirit.
Although trading began on a positive note when the KSE-100 index reached its intra-day high at 65,859.63 points, profit-taking kicked in very soon, which triggered widespread selling and a gradual decline in the KSE-100 index.
Concerns over potential agreement on imposition of further taxes during government’s talks with the IMF for a new loan programme coupled with the impending monetary policy announcement pulled the market down. Additionally, the finance minister’s remarks about the challenges expected in FY24, alongside worries over a potential surge in industrial gas tariffs, undermined investor sentiment. Notably, fertiliser, exploration and production (E&P) and power sectors weighed heavily on the index.
Consequently, the index dropped below the 65,000 mark, touching the intra-day low at 64,664.66 points.
“Stocks closed bearish on weak rupee and uncertainty about monetary policy announcement on March 18 amid high inflation and IMF review beginning March 14,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti. “Finance minister’s comments that FY24 will be a difficult financial year, concerns over a surge in industrial gas tariffs and uncertainty about the outcome of Pakistan-IMF talks for a new loan played the role of catalysts in negative close at the PSX.”
Read: PSX wipes out all gains, falls marginally
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a plunge of 953.60 points, or 1.45%, and settled at 64,801.70.
Topline Securities Deputy Head of Sales Ali Najib, in his report, said at the day’s high, profit-taking was initiated and it subsequently converted into an across-the-board selling spree.
“The selling trend can be attributed to apprehensions associated with the forthcoming monetary policy announcement (scheduled for March 18) and the anticipation of further tax imposition in the aftermath of government’s dialogue for a new IMF programme,” he said.
Fertiliser, E&P and power sectors contributed negatively to the index as Dawood Hercules Corporation, Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum, Hub Power and Engro Corporation lost 341 points, Najib added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, noted that there was a “strong downward session with 80 shares falling and only eight rising.”
“Dawood Hercules (-7.5%), Oil and Gas Development Co (-3.35%) and Pakistan Petroleum (-3.11%) were the largest drags on the index,” it said, adding that the prime minister picked a former banker as finance minister in a major shift towards technocrats to steer the economy and negotiate a new loan package with the IMF.
“Monetary policy committee meeting is scheduled to convene on March 18 with a strong possibility that it may consider kick-starting the interest rate reversal cycle by implementing a 100-basis-point cut,” AHL noted.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that the bearish spell continued as the KSE-100 index lost 954 points.
“Going forward, we recommend investors to stay cautious at current levels and wait for dips for any fresh buying,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 321.7 million shares against Monday’s tally of 548.8 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs10.9 billion.
Shares of 328 companies were traded. Of these, 57 stocks closed higher, 254 dropped and 17 remained unchanged.
Hascol Petroleum was the volume leader with trading in 29.3 million shares, losing Rs0.36 to close at Rs8.14. It was followed by Pakistan International Airlines Corp with 28.9 million shares, gaining Rs0.07 to close at Rs18.10 and Cnergyico PK with 25.5 million shares, losing Rs0.34 to close at Rs4.77.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs98.5 million, according to the NCCPL.

5,Car sales drop 8% amid economic strain,"Rising prices, consumer constraints drive decline","Car sales dropped to 9,709 units, marking an 8% decline on a month-on-month basis due to factors such as rising car prices, expensive auto financing, and consumers’ low purchasing power, according to data reported by the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA), compiled and shared by Topline Securities on Tuesday.
Moreover, there was a significant 57% year-on-year increase in auto sales in February 2024.
Additionally, car sales for non-PAMA members totalled 10,900 units, reflecting a 7% decrease on a month-on-month basis, while sales rose by 52% year-on-year during February 2024.
Analysts and automakers stated that it would take ample time to bolster sales as the country’s economic conditions worsen, and buying new cars is perceived as a luxury. They noted that people are primarily focusing on essential items. They anticipated lacklustre auto sales during the first and second weeks of Ramazan but expected some momentum in the last week before Eidul Fitr.

Indus Motors experienced a 26% month-on-month decline in auto sales, reaching 2,036 units in February 2024.
During the first eight months of fiscal year 2024 (July to February), car sales decreased by 41% to 59,699 units, as reported by PAMA, compared to the 101,426 units registered in 8MFY 2023.
“Some stability in auto sales is likely going forward! The International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s loan and falling rates will provide some support to sales,” commented Topline Securities CEO Mohammad Sohail.
Author and auto expert Murtaza Mandviwala remarked that it is challenging to forecast anything in the current situation. Despite the poor financial situation, automakers will continue to introduce new models and instalment plans in the local market. Furthermore, tractor sales decreased by 12% on a month-on-month basis but registered a 1% increase to 3,366 units year-on-year in February 2024.

6,Punjab greenlights Rs100b Innovation City project,CM allocates Rs10b for initiative set to generate one million jobs,"The government of Punjab has announced that it has categorically approved the long-awaited Innovation City project in Lahore, a Rs100 billion development plan, with a scope of generating one million jobs.
The project has the potential to redefine the landscape and become a growth engine of Punjab’s provincial capital. However, even in the previous tenure of Mian Shehbaz Sharif as Chief Minister of Punjab, this venture was unable to materialise.
Previously, the Lahore Knowledge Park Company was executing this mega project, but the development and implementation of this city, now renamed as ‘Nawaz Sharif Innovation City’, has been shifted to the Punjab Central Business District Development Authority.
On Tuesday, Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz Sharif gave approval and allocated Rs10 billion as seed money for this project.
Read: Ministry releases Rs129b for development projects
The project will be divided into four key segments. The first is the IT city, where an Information Technology and Technology district will be developed on 200 acres of land. Once completed, this will be the country’s first dedicated IT and tech mega district with state-of-the-art allied facilities for development and exports of IT-related products and services. The project is positioned as a focal point for leading IT companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, and renowned international educational institutions.
The other key segment is the Education City, where collaborations with foreign universities for quality education and research and development work will be materialised. The third is Film City, where modern studios, production houses, and allied artistic facilities will be developed for creating a complete entertainment ecosystem.
The last segment is the commercial and residential area, where modern living facilities coupled with world-class amenities will be offered. The entire project will have proper road, water, and sewerage infrastructure with allocated space for parks and green areas.
The entire project will have special economic zones, with a tax holiday for 10 years. The authority’s revenue models include self-generation, Joint Ventures, and REI. Estimates suggest that around Rs400 billion worth of investments will be attracted in the form of Public-Private-Partnerships and Joint Ventures.
Experts in the IT, education, and infrastructure sectors say that the success of this mega project depends on how quickly they materialise what they are promising. “We have previously seen that this project, then called the knowledge city, failed to materialise as promised. This time, its name has changed but the offerings are almost the same. This is a huge project, which surely needs active participation from foreign companies, firms, individuals, educational institutes, and film production houses. In addition, the province has to tackle interdepartmental and structural issues and other bureaucratic hurdles.”
However, they added that if completed successfully, this project can drive the provincial economy and make it a perfect investment hub for foreign companies to do business and for universities to collaborate on research and development and other allied studies.

7,Oil steady as OPEC retains demand forecasts,Recent data emanating from China has suggested weakening demand,"Oil prices were little changed on Tuesday as OPEC stuck by its forecast for demand growth this year and next, amid persistent tensions in the Middle East and beyond.
Brent futures for May delivery were up 24 cents at $82.45 a barrel by 1420 GMT. The April US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude contract rose 31 cents at $78.24.
On Tuesday, OPEC stuck to its forecast for relatively strong growth in global oil demand in 2024 and 2025, and further raised its economic growth forecast for this year saying there was more room for improvement.

The monthly report from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) is expected later on Tuesday, while the International Energy Agency (IEA), which advises industrialised nations, is anticipated to put out its estimates on Thursday.
“While we believe the estimates will be largely unchanged, any upside surprise will ease demand concerns,” ANZ analysts said.
However, recent data emanating from China has suggested weakening demand.

8,Banks achieve 86% growth in profits,Boost total earnings to record high of Rs572b amid higher interest rate season,"Pakistan’s banks listed on the stock market have reported an outstanding growth of 86% in their net profit in the year ended December 2023, boosting total earnings to a record high of Rs572 billion amid a higher interest rate season in the country.
The banks have managed to achieve a record high profit despite economic slowdown and underperforming industrial activities in the country.
In a brief commentary, Topline Securities’ research analyst Sunny Kumar said, “This profit was primarily driven by a significant jump in net interest income (NII) amid high interest rates and balance sheet growth.”
In US dollar terms, listed banks’ profit was up 36% to $2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022.
In a recent report, Arif Habib Limited’s economist Sana Tawfik said that almost all the listed banks have recorded their historic high profits during the calendar year 2023.
“In calendar year 2023, the banking sector in the listed space witnessed significant profits (i.e., 86% year-on-year) driven mainly by policy rate hikes of 600 basis points coupled with volumetric growth in deposits (over 24% in 2023 compared to 2022),” she said.
The net profits were also “supported by 21% lower provisioning (bad loans or non-performing loans) and 16% higher non-interest income during the year.”
However, with rates likely to have peaked, she foresees the onset of a monetary easing cycle in the ongoing first half of 2024, leading to a decline in rates, down from the current record high of 22%.
Read: Bank financing hits record high
Despite the projected decline in sector net interest margins in the latter part of the ongoing calendar year 2024 due to a likely reversal in monetary policy stance (interest rate cut), AHL’s optimism regarding the overall profitability outlook remains unwavering.
“We find several mitigating factors supporting this positive sentiment, including the lagged re-pricing of assets versus funding cost, potential expansion of the balance sheet, sustained support from non-interest income, reduced inflationary pressure mitigating operating expenses, and the opportunity to realise capital gains on the fixed PIB (Pakistan Investment Bonds) portfolio. We expect the sector’s near-term earnings to maintain strength, with full-year CY24 earnings growth estimated at 12%.”
However, it is important to note potential challenges such as the implementation of IFRS-9 and the possibility of Non-Performing Loan (NPLs/bad loans) accretion exceeding projections, which could dampen the overall financial performance of the sector, she said.
Last week, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded Pakistan’s banking sector outlook to stable (Caa3) from negative, believing the financial institutions’ solid profitability and stable funding and liquidity provide an adequate buffer to withstand the country’s macroeconomic challenges and political turmoil.
It, however, raised a serious concern on banks lending depositor money mostly to the government under the provided high-interest rate and high inflation scenario, leaving a little chunk of the funding for the private sector, which remains the engine of economic growth in the country.
“High-interest rates and inflation will continue to curb private-sector spending and investment. Furthermore, banks are financing the sovereign’s wide fiscal deficits, leaving little space to lend to the real economy.”
Pakistani banks remain highly exposed to the government via large holdings of government securities that amount to around half of total banking assets, which links their credit strength to that of the sovereign.
Government securities account for 51% of Pakistani banks’ total assets and around nine times their equity.
Deepening financial inclusion and remittances from non-resident Pakistanis are broadening domestic deposit inflows. Banks are mainly deposit-funded, with customer deposits accounting for 58% of total assets as of September 2023, and have very low reliance on more volatile market funding (5.6% of tangible assets as of December 2022) given limited access to international debt markets.
AHL expert Tawfik further said that in 2023 the banking sector demonstrated an outstanding performance, achieving remarkable milestones that surpassed previous records. One of the key highlights was the substantial increase in dividends, which surged by an impressive 84% compared to the previous year.
Resultantly, this exceptional price performance led to the banking sector outpacing the Pakistan Stock Exchange (KSE100 index), with a whopping 85% return compared to the index’s 55% during 2023.
Customer deposits at banks grew 21% in the past one year to Rs27.54 trillion in January 2024 compared to Rs22.75 trillion in the same month of last year.
Bank deposits grew for two major reasons – conversion of workers’ remittances into Pakistani rupees and soaring government debt taken from local banks. Both transactions are shown in deposits. The local relatives of overseas Pakistanis who send funds back home deposit them in banks.
The government borrowed from banks for deficit financing, but the money continued to remain parked in banks, which inflated the deposit size.

9,PM pushes for IT sector expansion,"Targets billion-dollar exports, orders comprehensive roadmap to harness IT potential","Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday directed the submission of a comprehensive roadmap to boost IT exports. He stated that the government would take steps to fully utilise the billion-dollar potential of the country for IT exports, and ensure that young people are provided with the necessary facilities for education, skills development, and startups.
The prime minister chaired a review meeting on the IT and Telecom sector, attended by Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb, Minister for Economic Affairs and Establishment Ahad Khan Cheema, Minister of State for IT Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Governor State Bank of Pakistan Jameel Ahmed, Shahzad Saleem, and other relevant senior officials, PM Office Media Wing said in a press release. During the meeting, the prime minister highlighted the positive outcomes witnessed from the initiation of different projects in the IT sector during their previous tenure.
He stressed the resolution of all issues faced by startups, freelancers, and IT companies relating to banking. Expressing satisfaction over the current year’s IT export volume of more than $3 billion, he emphasised its further increase. He observed that to bring Pakistan’s IT sector to international standards, rigorous efforts are required.

The prime minister also requested the submission of a comprehensive report regarding special technology zones. The meeting was briefed on progress regarding the IT package announced by the prime minister in June 2023. Due to the special attention of PM Sharif during the previous tenure, IT exports witnessed a 13% increase during the first seven months of the current fiscal year compared to the previous corresponding year.
Under the Digiskills programme, a total of 4 million students from 17 batches, including 28% females, have been imparted training. Pakistan has emerged as the second top country in the world based on the number of freelancers. Additionally, Pakistan is exporting IT products to 170 countries worldwide.
The meeting was informed that during the previous year, an investment of $400 million was made in Pakistani startups. The prime minister directed the necessary legal and policy-related steps to attract investment and boost IT exports. He also called for expediting work on projects meant to enhance professional and technical training for youth to fully utilise the potential in the IT sector. The meeting was also briefed on the progress of IT, E-Rozgar, startups, cybersecurity, the telecom sector, and the launch of 5G.
