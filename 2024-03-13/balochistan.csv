0,Metrobus tracks to undergo revamp,"From potholes to structural concerns, the restoration aims to ensure safe travel","The Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) has initiated the process of consultation for the rehabilitation of the 24 km track of the metro bus service connecting Rawalpindi and Islamabad after securing Rs719 million from the Pakistan Mass Transit Authority (PMA).
The track has fallen into disrepair since 2015, as maintenance has been neglected, leading to hazardous conditions.
The 10 km flyover route of the Rawalpindi-Islamabad metro bus service, situated within Rawalpindi, and the 14 km track within Islamabad, have developed potholes due to the lack of maintenance since the commencement of operations in 2015. Over the past nine years, the condition of all 24 stations along with their corridors has significantly deteriorated, with joints of the flyover route posing potential risks.
The last Pak Secretariat station of the metro bus service has also been adversely affected by continuous water ingress, impacting construction.
The deteriorating condition of the metro bus service’s routes, including potholes, prompted the Pakistan Mass Transit Authority (PMA) to approach the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA), the executing agency of the project, for a complete restoration. The PMA allocated funds amounting to Rs719 million for this purpose, based on an estimate. Subsequently, the RDA, responsible for the project, initiated the process of appointing a consultant before commencing the restoration work.
Sources within the RDA have confirmed that the project is expected to be completed within two months once the consultant is hired. 
The comprehensive restoration will encompass all 24 stations and the entire route of the metro bus service.
It is noteworthy that the metro bus service, initiated on June 3, 2015, connecting Rawalpindi and Islamabad, has suffered from a lack of infrastructure upkeep and reconstruction since its completion in eleven months for a cost of Rs44 billion. Despite providing high-quality travel facilities to citizens, the service has been without maintenance or repair for nine years. The RDA prepared the restoration project, which was subsequently approved by the Mass Transit Authority, leading to the release of funds.
The metro bus service, spanning 24 kilometres from Rawalpindi’s Saddar to Pak Secretariat in Islamabad, with a station every kilometre, initially aimed to offer quality and affordable travel facilities. However, over the years, the infrastructure suffered significant damage, necessitating a comprehensive restoration.
The allocated funds may not cover the full extent of required repairs, indicating the need for additional funding. Yet, PMA has not addressed another proposal concerning these issues.

1,Pheni & khajla become citizens’ favourites,Stalls of pheni have opened up in different areas alongside sweet shops to cater to those fasting.,"With the arrival of the holy month of Ramazan, families who are fasting engage in preparing various types of dishes for sehri and iftar table spreads. One of the well-known dishes that are consumed around Pakistan is khajla and pheni, without which sehri is considered incomplete.
As soon as the blessings of the month of Ramadan begin, even shop owners become busy preparing for Ramazan. Stalls of pheni have opened up in different areas alongside sweet shops to cater to those fasting.
As is the custom in many cities of the country, it is considered almost essential to eat pheni and khajla for sehri in Ramazan in the federal capital. Therefore, in areas where there are a large number of citizens out and about, shop sellers are also busy making large quantities of pheni.
Pheni is a dish prepared from flour which is first kneaded into a dough and then made into patties using ghee before it is fried in ghee. Khajla is a kind of deep-fried break that is also prepared from flour and fried in hot oil.
Pheni is a dish which takes a lot of work to prepare. This is why preparations for it begin even before Ramazan. A worker, Sabir Butt said that the prices of gas and oil have increased due to which the cost price of pheni has also increased.

2,Winners of Gender Climate Award announced,Pakistan Gender Climate Award 2024 to shine a light on Pakistani women and recognise their leadership and contribution,"To celebrate International Women’s Day, the Embassy of France and Agence Française de Développement (AFD), the European Union Delegation, the Embassy of the United Arab Emirates, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Civil Society Coalition for Climate Change (CSCCC), has announced the winners of the second edition of the Gender Climate Award on Monday.
The objective of the award is to highlight women’s commitment and leadership in the fight against climate change under three categories: climate action, green business, and young climate journalism.
The winners of the Pakistan Gender Climate Award 2024 are Qandeel Rehman, (Climate Action), Umbreen Arif (Green Business), and Khalida Niaz (Young Climate Journalism). Each winner will receive Rs1.2 million to advance their activity and use the funds to deepen the gender climate nexus in their area of work.
The Pakistan Gender Climate Award 2024 seeks to shine a light on Pakistani women and recognise their leadership and contribution as equal partners in change. The dynamic and resourceful women of Pakistan work in diverse fields ranging from civil society to academia, science to media, business and beyond.
The award is designed to highlight the fact that climate change is not gender-neutral. It impacts women and girls disproportionately, amplifying existing inequalities. With stark disparities in opportunity and access, climate change can harm women’s livelihoods, as well as their health and well-being.
