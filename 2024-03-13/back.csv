0,Japanese firm Space One's Kairos rocket explodes on inaugural flight,"The 18-metre (59 ft) rocket exploded five seconds after lifting off, leaving behind a large cloud of smoke","Kairos, a small, solid-fuel rocket made by Japan's Space One, exploded just seconds into its inaugural launch on Wednesday as the firm tried to become the first Japanese company to put a satellite in orbit.
The setback for Space One and the rocket industry in Japan comes as the government and investors ramp up support for the sector amid a national security buildup and skyrocketing demand for commercial satellites.
The 18-metre (59 ft) rocket exploded five seconds after lifting off, leaving behind a large cloud of smoke, a fire, fragments of the rocket and sprays of firefighting water near the launch pad on the tip of mountainous Kii peninsula in western Japan, visible on local media livestreams.
""The rocket terminated the flight after judging that the achievement of its mission would be difficult,"" company president Masakazu Toyoda said.
Space One did not specify what triggered self-destruction after the first-stage engine ignited - or when the company would launch the next Kairos - only pledging an investigation into the explosion.
The company said that the launch is highly automated, requiring only about a dozen ground staff, and that the rocket self-destructs when it detects errors in its flight path, speed or control system that could cause a crash that endangers people on the ground.
""We don't use the world 'failure', because each trial brings us ... new data and experience for another challenge,"" Toyoda told a news conference.
There were no injuries near the launch pad, and the fire has been extinguished, Shuhei Kishimoto, governor of Wakayama prefecture, told reporters.
Kairos carried an experimental government satellite that can temporarily replace intelligence satellites in orbit if they fall offline.
Space One had planned the launch for Saturday but postponed it after a ship entered the nearby restricted sea area.
Although Japan is a relatively small player in the space race, the nation's rocket developers are scrambling to build cheaper vehicles to capture booming demand for satellite launches from its government and from global clients.
Tokyo-based Space One was established in 2018 by a consortium of Japanese companies: Canon Electronics (7739.T), opens new tab, the aerospace engineering unit of IHI (7013.T), opens new tab, construction firm Shimizu (1803.T), opens new tab and the state-backed Development Bank of Japan. Two of Japan's biggest banks, Mitsubishi UFJ (8306.T), opens new tab and Mizuho (8411.T), opens new tab, also own minority stakes.
Shares in Canon Electronics fell as much as 13%, while IHI shares were down as much as 2% after Wednesday's failed launch.
Space One wants to offer ""space courier services"" to domestic and international clients, aiming to launch 20 rockets a year by the late 2020s, Toyoda has said. Although the company delayed Kairos' inaugural launch window four times, it said orders for its second and third planned trips have been filled, including by an overseas customer.
Kairos is composed of three stages of solid-fuel engines and a liquid-fuel post-boost stage engine, attempting to carry payloads of up to 250 kg to low-Earth orbit.
Space One does not disclose Kairos' launch costs, but company executive Kozo Abe said it is ""competitive enough"" against American rival Rocket Lab (RKLB.O), opens new tab.
Rocket Lab has launched more than 40 Electron small rockets from New Zealand since 2017 at roughly $7 million per flight. Several Japanese companies have used Electron for their missions, including radar satellite makers iQPS (5595.T), opens new tab and Synspective, and orbital debris-removal startup Astroscale.
Partnering with the United States, Japan is seeking to revitalise its domestic aerospace industry to counter technological and military rivals China and Russia.
Last month, state-funded Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) successfully launched its new cost-efficient flagship rocket, the H3. JAXA completed a historic ""pinpoint"" moon landing this year, and the H3 is scheduled to carry about 20 satellites and probes to the space by 2030.
Before that, however, JAXA had faced a series of setbacks. H3's inaugural flight failed last year, as did another flight of a smaller rocket, Epsilon, in 2022. In July 2023, an upgraded engine for Epsilon exploded at JAXA's testing site.
In 2019, Interstellar Technologies conducted Japan's first privately developed rocket launch with its MOMO series, although without a full-scale satellite payload.
The government last year promised ""comprehensive"" support, opens new tab for space startups with technology critical for national security, as it seeks to build satellite constellations to ramp up intelligence capabilities.
Japan's defence ministry on Friday said it had struck a deal with Space One to boost its rockets' payload by experimenting with fuel-efficient methane engines.
""Rocket Lab, too, did not achieve its mission at the inaugural (Electron) flight, but it went on to launch three rockets in its second year,"" Toyoda said. ""We can't stop here – we need to compete with this company.

1,Putin warns the West: Russia is ready for nuclear war,Putin's nuclear warning came alongside another offer for talks on Ukraine,"President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Wednesday Russia was technically ready for nuclear war and that if the U.S. sent troops to Ukraine, it would be considered a significant escalation of the conflict.
Putin, speaking just days before a March 15-17 election which is certain to give him another six years in power, said the nuclear war scenario was not ""rushing"" up and he saw no need for the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.
""From a military-technical point of view, we are, of course, ready,"" Putin, 71, told Rossiya-1 television and news agency RIA in response to a question whether the country was really ready for a nuclear war.
Putin said the U.S. understood that if it deployed American troops on Russian territory - or to Ukraine - Russia would treat the move as an intervention.
""(In the U.S.) there are enough specialists in the field of Russian-American relations and in the field of strategic restraint,"" said Putin, the ultimate decision maker in the world's biggest nuclear power.
""Therefore, I don't think that here everything is rushing to it (nuclear confrontation), but we are ready for this.""
Putin's nuclear warning came alongside another offer for talks on Ukraine as part of a new post-Cold War demarcation of European security. The U.S. says Putin is not ready for serious talks over Ukraine.
The war in Ukraine has triggered the deepest crisis in Russia's relations with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and Putin has warned several times the West risks provoking a nuclear war if it sends troops to fight in Ukraine.
Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, triggering full-scale war after eight years of conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces on one side and pro-Russian Ukrainians and Russian proxies on the other.
In a U.S. election year, the West is grappling with how to support Kyiv against Russia, which now controls almost one-fifth of Ukrainian territory and is rearming much faster than the West and Ukraine.
Kyiv says it is defending itself against an imperial-style war of conquest designed to erase its national identity. Russia says the areas it controls in Ukraine are now Russia.
Putin has sent a series of public nuclear warnings to the U.S. aimed at discouraging greater involvement in Ukraine - a move the Kremlin says would mark a slide into world war.
Washington says it has seen no major changes to Russia's nuclear posture but Putin's public nuclear warnings - which break with the extreme caution of the Soviet leadership over such remarks - have sown concern in Washington.
Putin reiterated the use of nuclear weapons was spelled out in the Kremlin's nuclear doctrine, which sets out the conditions under which it would use such a weapon: broadly a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or the use of conventional weapons against Russia ""when the very existence of the state is put under threat.""
""Weapons exist in order to use them,"" Putin said. ""We have our own principles.""
CNN reported on Saturday the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden was specifically concerned in 2022 that Russia might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon in Ukraine.
Putin said he had never felt the need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.
Putin said Russia was ready for serious talks on Ukraine.
""Russia is ready for negotiations on Ukraine, but they should be based on reality - and not on cravings after the use of psychotropic drugs,"" Putin said.
Reuters reported last month that Putin's suggestion of a ceasefire in Ukraine to freeze the war was rejected by the U.S. after contacts between intermediaries.
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns warned earlier this week that if the West did not provide proper support for Ukraine, Kyiv would lose more territory to Russia which would embolden Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told the Senate Intelligence Committee it was in U.S. interests to support Ukraine to allow it to get into a stronger position before talks.
Putin said he trusted no one and Russia would need written security guarantees in the event of a settlement.
""I don't trust anyone, but we need guarantees, and guarantees must be spelled out, they must be such that we would be satisfied,"" Putin said.

2,NA resolution seeks to overturn Bhutto verdict,PPP demands highest award for ZAB; SIC slams arrests of PTI activists,"The National Assembly on Wednesday passed a resolution to declare the death penalty awarded to former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, while senior leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) repeated their demand for the resignation of Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja.
During a National Assembly session, with Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah in the chair, the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) lawmakers protested against a ban on the meetings with PTI founder Imran Khan and the arrest of party leaders. They demanded action against police officials responsible for the arrests.
Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) member of the National Assembly Shazia Marri moved the resolution against late Bhutto’s death penalty nearly 45 years ago. The resolution was opposed by the SIC, but it sailed through the lower house of parliament with a majority vote.
According to the resolution, the opinion of the Supreme Court given on a presidential reference about the Bhutto case earlier this month was commendable. In view of the apex court’s view, the resolution said that the “unjust decision” should be reversed and Bhutto be declared a martyr.

The resolution demanded Pakistan’s highest civilian award, the Nishan-e-Pakistan, be conferred upon the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto besides a new award, the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Award, should be established for those who sacrificed their lives for democracy.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gauhar Ali Khan opposed the resolution, saying that the opposition did not agree with this resolution. He emphasised that the resolution moved by PPP was not unanimous. Later, the house passed the resolution with majority.
During a session, PTI’s Omar Ayub Khan criticised CEC Raja and other members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). He claimed that Raja was being posted as Pakistan’s high commissioner to Canada.
Ayub also criticised the authorities for deny them a meeting with the PTI founder Imran Khan at the Adiala Jail because of the security concerns. “We showed him [a jail official] the court order but he threw it away,” he added.
He also raised the issue of arrests of the PTI activists in Punjab. He also condemned the harrassmet of party leader Sardar Latif. The chair ordered an investigation into the matter and sought a report. Ayub also demanded judicial probe into the allegations of rigging in the elections.

3,Imran predicts 'Sri Lanka-like debacle',Warns of horse-trading in the upcoming Senate elections,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founding chairman Imran Khan once again condemned the integrity of the February 8 general election, forecasting a scenario akin to Sri Lanka's recent political turbulence, attributing it to what he termed as the ""theft of the mandate"".
During an informal exchange with journalists at his confinement in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, the incarcerated former prime minister doubled down on his allegations, asserting that his prior predictions had proven accurate.
""My all predictions have proven true,"" he asserted, underscoring his stance against engaging in negotiations with the incumbent rulers for any form of reconciliation or compromise.

""Each and everything is based on lies... the election was a lie... the security threat was also a lie,"" he added, stressing that PTI was deliberately sidelined from the electoral arena.Despite the electorate's purported retaliation on polling day, Khan lamented that the desired change through democratic means was thwarted.
He vowed to persist in peaceful protests against the alleged rigging and pursue legal recourse through the Supreme Court.Anticipating potential ""horse-trading"" in the upcoming Senate elections slated for April 2, the deposed PM decried the obstruction in meeting his legal counsel, a claim he made amid ongoing proceedings related to the £190m scam in the NAB court.
As Pakistan prepares to secure the final tranche of a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Imran cautioned against escalating inflation, foreseeing public discontent manifesting in street protests.
Earlier, the court recorded statements from three additional witnesses, adjourning further hearings till March 16.
On Tuesday, the Punjab government slapped a two-week ban on public visits, meetings, and interviews at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, citing ""security"" concerns—a decision denounced by PTI leaders who alleged it was a calculated manoeuvre to obstruct their access to party founder Imran Khan, presently held at the facility.

4,ECP accepts plea for Gandapur’s disqualification,JUI’s Nizami moves application over concealment of 735 kanals of land by K-P CM in DI Khan,"The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) accepted the petition to disqualify Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and set the formal hearing for March 26 after the preliminary hearings.
A two-member bench of the Election Commission comprising Nisar Ahmed Durrani and Shah Muhammad Jatoi issued a notice to the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).
The bench directed the District Election Commission of DI Khan to submit a report concerning false statements on 735 kanal property in the nomination papers and allegations of asset concealment by Gandapur before March 26.
In the preliminary hearing on the application filed by Jamiat Ulema Islam (JUI) Kafeel Nizami, the bench was informed that 735 kanals of land in DI Khan had been temporarily transferred to Ali Amin Gandapur, despite Asif Khan being the original owner of the land.
According to the written decision, based on the asset details provided by Ali Amin in 2020, he acquired a Land Cruiser vehicle by selling the same land, which makes him ineligible for the Provincial Assembly seat due to false information.
It’s worth noting that the Election Commission received a petition against Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for purportedly concealing assets.
Jamiat Ulema Islam (JUI) Kafeel Nizami moved the application stating Ali Amin Gandapur made false statements regarding his property in the nomination papers.
By doing this, he added Ali Amin Gandapur is no more Sadiq and Amin. The petition requested the ECP to disqualify Gandpur as the chief minister.
