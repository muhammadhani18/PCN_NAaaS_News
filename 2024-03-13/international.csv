1,Entry of wrong CNIC number entangles man in police case,Petitioner says will lose job if police continue to bother him,"Wrong entry of national identity card number in police report has put a citizen in hot water.
Muhammad Qadeer stated before a Sindh High Court (SHC) bench that he regularly gets calls from police investigators, although he has nothing to do with the case in question.
""My employer has warned that he will fire me if I am involved in any police case,"" Qadeer told a two-member bench headed by Justice Naimatullah Phulphoto.
The investigation officer submitted that the name of the suspect was Kamran, but the report writer made a mistake in entering the CNIC number. Sadly, a mistake of few digits made it Qadeer's CNIC number and now he is on the police records.
The court directed the IO to verify the travel history and phone location of Qadeer and submit a report in the next hearing.
Missing persons
The bench, headed by Justice Naimatullah Phulphoto, heard the petitions regarding the missing persons.
The family of Aftab Ahmad Brohi states before the court that he has been missing since the last three years.
The officer representing the police said that Brohi was nominated in a case and was under arrest.
Besides Brohi, police provided the court with reports regarding the recovery of Hasan Ali Magsi and Zardar Khan, who were missing from the limits of the Boat Basin police station.
Magsi and Khan were wanted by the police and now they have returned home. 
The family of missing citizen, Noor Muhammad, appeared in the court.
The family told the court that Noor Muhammad has been missing for the last twelve years and the authorities have not yet taken any action. 
The court questioned the Investigating Officer (IO) as to why no action had been taken up to this point. 
The IO said that numerous JITs have been convened and letters have also been issued to the detention centres.
The court ruled that efforts for the recovery of Noor Muhammad, Habib Khan, Syed Naveed, and other individuals must continue. 
Additionally, the court mandated that photographs of the missing persons be displayed in public places. The court adjourned the hearing till April 18 while seeking a progress report from the IO on the next hearing.

2,Demand for copies of Holy Quran surges,"Digital, non-digital versions available offline and online in response to current trends","As the holy month of Ramazan commences the demand for copies of the Holy Quran increases manifolds, driven by the rising trend of daily recitation because the month is known as the month of self-purification through increased worship, spiritual cleansing, good deeds, and acts of charity.
Copies of the Holy Quran are distributed in mosques and madaris for esal-e-sawab (dedicating reward of a good deed or charitable act to another person). Moreover, they are given to friends and family as Ramazan gifts, contributing significantly to the increased demand for copies of the Holy Quran.
An important trend is the surge in demand among the youth, regardless of educational background, reflecting a growing desire to learn the Holy Quran. This is particularly evident in the increased interest in the versions aiding correct pronunciation during the fasting month. Similarly, there is a growing demand for larger-print editions, with accompanying translation and commentary (tafseer), catering to the elderly.
Usman Tahir, a distributor of the Holy Quran in Urdu Bazaar, told The Express Tribune that the pursuit of learning the Holy Quran with proper pronunciation has expanded not only among the youth but also among the elderly. In response to current trends and requirements, private institutions have introduced various digital and non-digital easy and Tajweed versions of the Holy Quran, available both offline and online.
According to Tahir, a publishing house has launched a Tajweedi Quran with 15 lines per page, designed for those familiar with Nazra (recitation without understanding), priced at Rs920 per copy. Another offering is a 16-line-per-page Holy Quran with Tajweed, aiding in correct pronunciation during recitation.
Qari Yasir, associated with the publication of the Holy Quran, noted the availability of 30-part sets with full laminated coating, presented in leather pouches at a discounted price of Rs12,000 during Ramazan. A version in large letters is accessible for the elderly, priced at Rs1,600, containing 12 lines per page with Hashiya (explanations in the margins.)
Tahir highlighted the popularity of the Holy Quran version titled Ahsan Al-Kalam, featuring translations in 28 different languages and audio recitation, while Yasir mentioned a copy with easy translation and commentary priced at Rs1,750.
Yasir also spoke about the increased attraction towards worship during Ramazan, prompting the publication of Manzil for individuals seeking additional rewards through reciting different surahs or manazil. These are available at a price of Rs45 each, and Punj Surahs with Manzil can be obtained for Rs110 each.
Tahir drew attention to a beautiful set containing Surah Yasin, Punj Surah, Noorani Qaida, and easy prayer, becoming a popular choice for households.
For children, publishing houses offer ""The Tracing Quran,"" featuring 42 Surahs, with the unique feature of allowing handwritten notes while reading. Moreover, pocket-size Siparahs pf the Holy Quran are available for travelers during Ramazan, priced at Rs1,380. Haji Salman, known for donating the Holy Quran sets and Siparahs to mosques, underlined the significance of understanding and acting upon the Holy Book, complementing the act of recitation.

3,Sindh boards drag feet on new grading system,Other provinces have already done spadework to gradually introduce the new system,"Despite the nationwide approval of a new grading policy for matric and intermediate levels, its implementation in Sindh is facing difficulties due to the apparent lack of interest from relevant authorities, The Express Tribune has learnt. 
The grading policy, modeled after the O and A-Levels of Cambridge Assessment International Education, is set to be gradually introduced for the assessment of the 2024 matric and inter annual examinations nationwide. However, no preparations have been initiated in the education boards of Sindh for the implementation of this policy. 
This delay may result in students in Sindh lagging behind their peers in the other provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, who are expected to receive results under the new grading policy.
Recognising this situation, the Federal Ministry of Education formally wrote a letter to the Department of Universities and Boards of the Government of Sindh on March 6. The letter stresses the need for a decisive implementation of the new grading system, ensuring uniformity with passing marks set at 40 in all educational boards. 
This directive aligns with the decision approved by the Inter Board Coordination Commission (IBCC), an organisation of chairmen of education boards nationwide, in November 2022. The implementation of this decision was further approved at the Interprovincial Education Ministers' Conference held on December 22, 2023.
The Express Tribune contacted Universities and Boards Secretary Noor Samu for comments, but no response was received.
Notably, the phased application of the new policy is scheduled to commence with the examinations and results of classes IX and XI. Under this policy, passing marks for subjects will increase from 33 to 40, and students achieving at least 40 marks will be considered successful. The grading system will transition to Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) over three years, with only grades being reflected on the students' mark sheets.
While education boards in the other three provinces have begun preparations for implementing the new grading system, there is no apparent readiness in Sindh. The Ziauddin Board, operating on a private basis in Sindh, has issued a notification for the implementation of the 2024 annual examinations in alignment with the IBCC's decision, applying a new grading system based on Grade Point Average (GPA) for matriculation and intermediate exams this year. However, government education boards in Sindh seem unprepared for this change.
""No board in Sindh has a permanent controller of examinations, nor is the board secretary working permanently. The boards suffer from ad-hocism at its worst, making it seemingly impossible to implement a decision of such magnitude, which also requires the training of assessment teachers,"" a board chairman informed The Express Tribune while speaking on the condition of anonymity.
""There has been no progress in this regard from the officials of the Department of Universities and Boards. Boards alone cannot make such a significant decision,"" he added.
It is crucial to note that if government education boards in Sindh do not catch up with the implementation of this new grading policy, it could negatively impact hundreds of thousands of matric and inter students in the province. Two years later, when graduates from other provinces apply for university admissions, their results will include GPA under the new grading policy, requiring a minimum of 40 passing marks. Meanwhile, students from Sindh will still adhere to the old system, passing papers with at least 33 marks.
This discrepancy extends beyond university admissions, as inter students from the Ziauddin Education Board in Sindh, operating on a private basis, will graduate under the new grading policy, unlike their peers in government education boards in the province. This could lead to a situation where Sindh's students have two types of marksheets, causing confusion and potentially affecting their academic and professional pursuits.

4,Robotic surgery on diabetic at JPMC,"Jinnah Hospital has conducted a total of 135 robotic surgeries, including those in urology, gynaecology","For the first time in Pakistan, Jinnah Hospital in Karachi has achieved a breakthrough by successfully conducting robotic surgery on patients suffering from diabetes and obesity. 
Professor Shahid Rasool, leading the surgical team, asserts that following this procedure, patients may no longer require diabetes medication or insulin.
The groundbreaking surgery, aimed to treat obesity and metabolic conditions, was performed free of charge at the hospital. 
During the procedure, the patient’s stomach was reduced in size to address diabetes, while modifications were made to the large intestine to expedite the digestive process. Professor Rasool, spearheading the operation, highlighted its significance. The patient was a 45-year-old woman suffering from diabetes, with 140 kgs of weight. 
Professor Rasool explained that post-surgery, the patient is expected to experience weight loss, with an aim to eliminate diabetes. Subsequently, diabetic medications and insulin will no longer be required for the patient. The procedure has resulted in the complete remission of diabetes in 70 per cent of similar cases. 
Jinnah Hospital has conducted a total of 135 robotic surgeries, including those in urology, gynaecology, and general surgeries, since its inception in September 2023. Specialised training sessions were held for gynaecological robotic surgeries, given their complexity, alongside workshops organised within the hospital.

5,"‘Banish samosas, pakoras from iftar menu’","Medical practitioner, dietitian recommend balanced diet during Ramazan","Medical experts and dieticians underline the importance of a balanced diet for those fasting during the holy month of Ramazan. They advise people, especially for those with specific health conditions, against consuming fried and fatty foods. 
General physician Dr Faisal Javed and nutritionist Naveed Bhutto, while speaking to The Express Tribune on Tuesday, advised people to opt for fruits with high water content in Sehr (pre-dawn meal) and Iftar meals. For those with high blood pressure, fried and salty foods are not advisable, they added. ""Similarly, diabetics should avoid sugary and coloured drinks."" 
Dr Javed and Bhutto recommended solid, non-flour-based meals throughout the fasting month to minimise the risk of hypoglycemia. While flat bread (roti) is suitable for Sehri, they advised against consumption of bread and rusk due to their fast digestion, potentially leading to hypoglycemia. 
It is suggested to focus on less spicy and oily ingredients, incorporating more meat, fruits, and vegetables into the diet. Deep-fried items like samosas and pakoras should be avoided in Iftar, with an emphasis on consuming fruits during this time.
Addressing weight concerns, Dr Javed and Bhutto cautioned against frequent consumption of fried items, even in moderation. They said the use of an air fryer can be considered to reduce oil content. Excessive fried foods during Iftar may contribute to weight gain, increasing the risk of heart-related issues.
Fasting poses challenges for diabetic patients, necessitating careful consideration. Factors such as the duration of the condition, blood sugar management, history of hypoglycemia, and past fasting experiences are crucial. Patients experiencing issues like hypoglycemia, blood pressure symptoms, renal failure, or uncontrolled sugar levels are advised against fasting. Those fasting should consult their doctor for adjustments in medication timing and dosage.
Bhutto underlined the importance of a well-balanced diet during Sehri and Iftar, suggesting foods with high water content such as cucumber, tomato, yogurt, and watermelon. Consuming a variety of fruits, including dates, apples, and bananas, provides essential nutrients. A balanced diet, rich in carbohydrates and protein and low in fat, is recommended during Ramazan.
Sehri is a crucial part of fasting, and skipping it may lead to fatigue throughout the day. For those with diabetes, avoiding sugary drinks is advised, with a preference for fresh fruit juices. Consultation with a doctor is crucial for proper medication timing. High blood pressure and cardiac patients should stick to their prescribed diets and consult their doctors before fasting to mitigate potential effects on their health.
Dr Javed and Bhutto concluded that maintaining a well-balanced diet is essential during Ramazan, and seeking professional medical advice is crucial for those with specific health conditions.

6,IG Sindh orders inquiry against CTD officer,"SSP Fida Hussain accused of unlawfully arresting, detaining, and subjecting Abbasullah to torture","The Inspector General (IG) of Sindh Police, Riffat Mukhtar Raja, has initiated an inquiry against Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Syed Fida Hussain Shah of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) following the allegations of illegal arrest, torture, and detention of a businessman. 
The inquiry comes in response to a written complaint lodged by the businessman, Abbasullah. 
It has been reported that the Sindh Home Secretary has directed IG Sindh to look into the matter.
According to the FIR, Abbasullah has accused SSP Fida Hussain of unlawfully arresting, detaining, and subjecting him to torture. 
He claims that the SSP demanded access to his bank account for personal financial transactions and insisted on receiving a blank check in advance. Upon refusal, Abbasullah alleges he was illegally detained and subjected to torture. 
Meanwhile, SSP Shah told The Express Tribune that Abbasullah was detained lawfully due to suspicious activities. According to him, Abbasullah had been summoned to the CTD Garden a few days prior but failed to appear, prompting law enforcement officials to detain him for further investigation. 
He added that the CTD had received information suggesting that Abbasullah’s security guard had connections with proscribed organisations, hence the request for his bank account details. 
The SSP allegeed that Abbasullah’s movements raise suspicions, and his lack of cooperation in the investigation is exacerbating the situation. A complaint regarding the illegal occupation of a factory against Abbasullah is also under investigation.
