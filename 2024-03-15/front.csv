1,Backlash forces withdrawal of IRSA appointment,Govt backtracks on IRSA appointment,"After facing strong resistance from the Sindh province, ruled by one of its major coalition partners, the PPP, the PML-N-led federal government has withdrawn a notification appointing a former federal secretary, Zafar Mahmood, as the chairman of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa).
During the previous term of the PML-N, Mahmood was also appointed as the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) chairman after retiring as a federal secretary.
However, Mahmood had to step down as the Wapda chairman due to the former prime minister's displeasure over the non-completion of dams, especially the Neelum Jhelum hydropower project.
Now, Shehbaz Sharif made his first controversial decision soon after becoming the prime minister for the second time by appointing Mahmood as the chairman of Irsa, a regulator comprising members from all four provinces for the fair and transparent distribution of water resources.
The province of Sindh strongly objected to the move, with Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah conveying his reservations to Shehbaz in a telephone call. PM Shehbaz assured Shah to address his concerns.
Sindh Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro later told media that the CM in his conversation with Shehbaz emphasized the appointment of the Irsa chairman through rotation among provincial members in line with a decision of the Council of Common Interests (CCI).
Later, the principal secretary to the PM issued a notification stating that Mahmood's appointment as the Irsa chairman would be treated as withdrawn.
The appointment of Zafar Mahmood—a retired BS-22 federal government officer—as the Irsa chairman also sparked controversy in the National Assembly.

PPP MNA Syed Naveed Qamar raised serious reservations over Mahmood's appointment, declaring it illegal and unconstitutional. He urged the Shehbaz government to immediately withdraw the notification.
The appointment was also opposed by various political parties from Sindh, including the Awami Tehreek, Grand Democratic Alliance, Sindh Taraqi Pasand Party, and Jeay Sindh Mahaz-Riaz. They labeled the appointment notification as unconstitutional, illegal, and unethical.
CM Shah, addressing reporters in Karachi, underscored the necessity for Irsa's independence from federal influence, referring to an ordinance introduced during the caretaker government's tenure that amended the appointment process without consulting the provinces.
The controversial appointment of Mahmood as Irsa chairman was made under the disputed Irsa Amendment Ordinance 2024, which had been returned with reservations by the then president, Dr Arif Alvi, to the caretaker PM Anwaarul Haq Kakar.
The political parties in Sindh termed the proposed amendment as unconstitutional and illegal, arguing that the caretaker government did not have the authority to enact such changes.
These amendments granted extensive powers to the Chairman Irsa, raising concerns about the autonomy and effectiveness of the regulator.
The proposed law also prohibited the provinces from approaching the CCI in case of objections to Irsa’s decision, while empowering the Irsa chairman to request the federal government to call the armed forces or other law enforcement agencies for the protection of installations or locations. It also granted powers to the Irsa chairman to hire employees and consultants.

2,Peace prospects with India ‘grim’,FO in briefing to PM says situation can change after Indian polls,"Prospects of any rapprochement between Pakistan and India are grim but the situation can change after the Indian elections, according to the assessment of the Foreign Office shared with the new government.
The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has been getting briefings from different departments and ministries since it took charge. The Foreign Office, in its assessment, gave its input to the government on foreign policy challenges including ties with India.
Soon after the prime minister took charge, the outgoing caretaker foreign minister Jailil Abbas Jilani along with Foreign Secretary Syrus Qazi briefed Shehbaz Sharif.
Earlier, this week there was another briefing at the foreign office for the newly appointed Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
The assessment both by the outgoing foreign minister and the foreign secretary suggested that there were no or little chances of any breakthrough in the relationship between Pakistan and India in the foreseeable future.
Dar was informed that India, under Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was pursuing a policy of “Hindutva.” He was told that the Modi government was taking practical steps to convert India into a pure “Hindu State.”

India has also been aggressively pursuing the policy to ensure Pakistan’s international isolation, according to the assessment. In this backdrop, there were grim prospects of any ice break between the two countries.
However, the foreign office was also of the view that the situation could take a turn around after the Indian elections that are due in next couple of months.
Indian Prime Minister Modi had congratulated Shehbaz Sharif over his election as the prime minister. However, his unusually terse statement raised many eyebrows.
Shehbaz took two days to respond and his reply was equally brief, suggesting that both sides were not willing to concede an inch.
There has been a stalemate in the relationship between Pakistan and India for many years. The real dip in the relationship came in August 2019 when India revoked the special status of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region.
Pakistan downgraded the diplomatic ties and suspended trade in reaction to the Indian unilateral move.
There was a brief period in 2021 when chances of breakthrough were high after both sides agreed to renew the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC).
But the process could not move forward after the then government of Prime Minister Imran Khan vetoed a proposal to partially restore trade.
Prior to the elections, there were some prospects of ice break as many predicted that Nawaz Sharif would return as prime minister.
However, his refusal to head a coalition government is believed to have dented any possibility of rapprochement.

3,Kerfuffle in NA as govt bulldozes legislation,Lower house grants extension to seven ordinances,"Tensions soared in the National Assembly on Friday as the government hurriedly pursued a resolution seeking an extension for seven ordinances, sparking protests led by the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) and drawing criticism from the PPP, the major ally of the coalition setup.
Federal Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar pushed forward seven ordinances and two bills amidst vehement opposition protests. Among the bills presented were The Civil Courts Amendment Bill, 2024, and the Legal Aid and Justice Authority Amendment Bill, 2024, both of which were referred to relevant standing committees.
The ordinances in question encompassed a range of issues from amendments to the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation to changes in the criminal law.
Opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan of the SIC vehemently opposed the move, accusing the government of attempting to pass ordinances without proper scrutiny, labelling it as a bid to ""sell Pakistan.""
Ayub accused the government of making unjust alterations to laws, citing the proposed removal of the word ""difficulties"" from 'The Pakistan Postal Services Management Board (Amendment) Ordinance, 2023' as an example.
Addressing lawmakers, he questioned whether they had thoroughly reviewed all ordinances under consideration, directing queries to specific members. ""Khawaja Asif sahib, have you read? Khursheed Shah sahib, have you read?"" Ayub asked, highlighting apparent gaps in comprehension.
Ayub further scrutinised the alterations proposed in 'The Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2023', questioning the level of scrutiny from standing committees.
He expressed concern over potential repercussions, referencing 'The National Highway Authority (Amendment) Ordinance, 2023'.
PTI MNA Gohar Khan criticised the amendments, alleging favouritism towards certain contractors and potential detriment to the nation.
As chaos ensued, with opposition members decrying the lack of transparency and accusing the government of undermining democratic processes, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq initiated a vote on the ordinance extension. Ultimately, 130 votes were cast in favour of the resolution, while 63 opposed it.
In response to the uproar, Minister Tarar condemned the opposition's actions, urging them to read the ordinances before making judgments. He also criticized opposition leaders for allegedly engaging in treasonous activities and emphasized the government's commitment to consulting with all allied parties.
Meanwhile, Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar, speaking in the house, urged the opposition to contribute positively to the country's progress.
He defended the introduction of ordinances, emphasising that they would be thoroughly discussed in committees and urged the opposition to provide input during these meetings.Tarar criticised the PTI's opposition to the ordinances, stating,""The country will not progress like this. You should engage in some soul-searching; writing letters to the IMF and EU will not yield any positive results.
""He noted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's directive to establish National Assembly committees regardless of party seat numbers.""The moment these ordinances are laid in front of this house, they will be converted into bills. Now, these bills are to be referred to the committees by the House,"" Tarar explained, highlighting the importance of broad representation in these committees.

Meanwhile, addressing the floor of the NA, PPP leader Naveed Qamar also voiced reservations over the ordinances presented in the National Assembly, urging Azam Nazeer Tarar not to proceed against the people's wishes.Qamar expressed concerns about the contents of the ordinances and their presentation, suggesting that if their implementation became irreversible, the assembly should be disbanded, and the ordinance process relocated.
Meanwhile, the speaker, visibly frustrated by disruptions, warned against further disorderly conduct, threatening disciplinary action. Following the tumultuous proceedings, the session was adjourned indefinitely.
Earlier in the session, five women were sworn in as MNAs on reserved seats, bringing the total number of oath-taking ceremonies in the NA to 316.The newly sworn-in MNAs include Shaheen Habibullah, Ghazal Anjum, Asma Alamgir, Naima Kanwal, and Naeema Kishore.
Later, in a media briefing in Islamabad, party leaders Omar Ayub Khan and Asad Qaiser emphasised that while lawmaking was parliament's responsibility, it should be done properly, particularly when considering the promulgation of ordinances.
The PTI leader criticised the government for initiating legislation without adherence to rules.
