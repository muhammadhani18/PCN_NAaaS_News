0,Farmers ask Sindh to begin wheat buying,Say procurement centres are still not functional though harvest has begun,"Growers’ bodies have urged Sindh government to make wheat procurement centres operational forthwith, provide gunny bags, purchase 1.4 million tonnes from farmers and raise support price as all such steps will benefit and encourage farmers.
They said peasants had been harvesting wheat for the past two weeks, but the government’s procurement centres were still dysfunctional. The harvest time starts on February 20 and lasts until April 30.
They expected a bumper crop of over 5 million tonnes in Sindh because of favourable winter weather, proper water supply and other supportive factors.
Almost 4.8 million tonnes of wheat had been produced in the province last year. The government fixed the support price at Rs4,000 per 40 kg for the previous season and set a procurement target of 1.4 million tonnes but, according to the growers, it could purchase 1.3 million tonnes because private buyers used to pay higher prices ranging from Rs4,500 to Rs4,600 per 40 kg in the local market.
This year though the output has gone up, the government has reduced the procurement target and has also not scaled up the support price despite the skyrocketing food inflation.
“We demand that the government make wheat procurement centres operational by April 1, provide gunny bags, ensure payments and raise the procurement target to 1.4 million tonnes from the current 900,000 tonnes,” said Nabi Bux Sathio, Senior Vice President of Sindh Chamber of Agriculture (SCA).
He pointed out that the wheat support price of Rs4,000 had been fixed by the Sindh caretaker setup and endorsed by the Sindh cabinet a day ago.
However, the input cost of agriculture which included fertilisers, seeds, fuel and others outweighed the return on output this year, said Sathio.
He added that if the government had hundreds of thousands of tonnes in wheat stocks, it must be investigated why flour mills and Chakkis (smaller flour mills) were not provided the commodity a couple of months ago when flour prices shot up.
He emphasised that now flour mills and Chakkis would definitely demand fresh wheat.
“We reject the support price of Rs4,000 per 40 kg and demand that the government fix the price at Rs6,000 as well as ensure the provision of wheat flour at Rs75 per kg for the benefit of people,” said Ali Palh Advocate, President of small growers’ organisation Sindh Agriculture Research Council (SARC).
He was of the view that the government must set the support price in line with the rising inflation.
“Growers have spent more on crops due to the hike in prices of seeds and fertilisers. If they do not get better returns, they will be discouraged and will not grow more wheat, putting food security at risk,” he said.
He asked for mainly focusing on research and development (R&D) in the agriculture sector to enhance crop yields with a view to averting future food security challenges as Pakistan’s population was rising day by day.
Instead of giving gunny bags for wheat procurement to third persons and middlemen, the government ought to provide them to small growers directly so that farmers could benefit from the policy, he stressed.
He claimed that the middlemen purchased wheat from growers at prices varying from Rs2,800 to Rs3,500 per maund and stressed the need for eliminating their role.

1,France eyes return to Pakistan’s LNG market,"After legal disputes, French firms seek collaboration to address looming gas shortage","France is poised to re-enter Pakistan’s Liquefied natural gas (LNG) export market after an absence of over a decade, following a legal dispute that led to a French company withdrawing from the sector. During the previous Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) administration, a contract for an LNG project was awarded to French firm, GDF-Suez (now ENGIE), which eventually ended up in the apex court.
The PPP government granted a 3.5 million tonne LNG import project to the GDF-Suez on February 9, 2010. However, in March of the same year, a news report alleged a $1 billion loss in the deal, prompting the Supreme Court to take suo motu notice of the matter. Upon investigation, the apex court found no loss and instructed the government to review the decision.
Subsequently, the Supreme Court directed the then prime minister to oversee the bidding process for LNG import in April 2010. However, disputes between the petroleum ministry and the law division led to the cancellation of the project. Following this, the French firm exited Pakistan and did not engage in any LNG ventures thereafter.
The subsequent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government signed an LNG deal with Qatar in 2015, effectively initiating LNG imports to Pakistan. In addition to Qatar, Pakistan has been importing LNG on a spot purchase basis. However, Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) has struggled to secure LNG deals through spot purchases in recent years. Even after floating a tender for short-term LNG deals, no companies participated.
As Pakistan’s indigenous gas reserves continue to deplete by 6% every year while demand rises, there emerges an opportunity for French firms to export LNG to Pakistan, potentially averting an impending gas crisis.
The PML-N government’s success in materialising LNG projects has drawn France’s interest back into the LNG business, with intentions to engage in other energy projects once PML-N returns to power.
In a recent meeting, the French Deputy Head of Mission, Guillaume Dabouis, met with the newly appointed Minister of Energy, Dr Musadiq Masood Malik. They discussed potential collaboration in Pakistan’s energy sector, including LNG cargo provision, energy resource exploration, and projects to improve energy trading, distribution, and transmission within the country. The French delegation also expressed interest in initiatives to reduce line losses and revitalise Pakistan’s energy sector.
The Pakistani minister reiterated his commitment to addressing Pakistan’s longstanding energy challenges comprehensively. He assured that the new government would present a thoroughly prepared plan to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), ensuring that any agreements made with the IMF are discussed with stakeholders to make sure they align with the best interests of the Pakistani people. Additionally, he underscored the government’s broader economic reform agenda, focusing on sectors such as energy, finance, commerce, industries and production, and communication. 
He ensured that the prioritisation of Informational Technology (IT) and Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) remains steadfast in line with the prime minister’s transformation plan. The minister affirmed the prime minister’s commitment to modernising the agricultural sector through the integration of AI and machine learning technologies.
The discussions between the French deputy head of mission and the minister of energy signal promising collaboration between the two countries, holding the potential to address Pakistan’s energy needs while fostering mutually beneficial partnerships.

2,Forex reserves rise 0.22% to $7.91b,"The central bank’s foreign currency reserves reached $7,912.9 million in the week","Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves increased 0.22% week-on-week to $7.91 billion, according to the weekly update released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday.
According to latest data, the central bank’s foreign currency reserves reached $7,912.9 million in the week ended on March 8, 2024, up $17.2 million compared to the previous week’s tally of $7,895.7 million. The State Bank cited no reason for the increase in reserves.
Of the total, the foreign currency reserves held by commercial banks rose to $5,238.4 million compared to $5,124.3 million a week ago. Accordingly, the country’s total liquid reserves came in at $13,151.3 million in the week under review, up from $13,020 million in the prior week.
The reserves increase in the backdrop of a surge in remittances and a stable rupee.

3,Gas utility increases LPG imports to stabilise prices,Consumers forced to pay sharply higher prices as black market thrives,"Pakistani households have been left at the mercy of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) black marketers, who are demanding significantly higher prices in the range of Rs300-400 per kg from consumers, who need the fuel to run their kitchens.
The consumers, especially in the hilly areas of Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B), are being forced to pay exorbitant prices, which are much higher than the retail price of Rs257 per kg fixed by the government.
As black marketers continue to make a windfall, different stakeholders including local producers, importers, dealers and retailers blame each other for charging higher prices from end-consumers.
SSGC LPG Limited (SLL), a wholly owned subsidiary of state-owned Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), announced on Thursday that it had increased the import of LPG to improve supplies and stabilise prices in the local markets.
The company, with a market share of just 8% in gas cylinder supplies, stressed that it would sell LPG at the government-determined price and had no role in LPG provision at inflated prices.
LPG Industries Association of Pakistan Founder and Chairman Irfan Khokhar blamed local companies and importers for charging extra prices, adding that dealers would sell gas at the rate set by the government once they got the fuel at the official price.
He stressed that black marketing of LPG could be controlled by increasing production of the fuel in Pakistan. “The association takes responsibility of reducing the price in retail market if the government ensures supplies from LPG plants at the official price,” he added.
After the closure of Jamshoro Joint Venture Limited (JJVL), Asia’s largest LPG plant, the consumers had been at the mercy of LPG importers, he said.
JJVL was supplying 525 tons of LPG per day and its closure created room for price manipulation as demand for gas cylinders reached 6,000 tons per day.
LPG is being sold at Rs300-320 per kg in different parts of the country, but it is available at Rs400 per kg in the hilly and remote areas.
Dismissing the talk of playing a role in charging additional prices from end-consumers, SSGC said in a comprehensive statement that SLL was a state-owned enterprise (SOE) and operated under the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division).
Under the directives of the ministry, SLL has increased imports of LPG to ensure that there are no shortages during peak demand seasons and Ramazan. “At the same time, SLL stands committed to ensuring that no room is provided to black marketers who take advantage of these shortages to artificially increase prices of LPG and earn extra profits from the consumers.”
There are more than 250 LPG marketing companies in Pakistan. SLL does not have any allocation of indigenously produced LPG and is totally dependent on imports.
SLL’s market share is about 8% which cannot be termed monopolistic whereas other similar companies are operating with larger market shares.
It should also be noted that the price of indigenous LPG is always lower than the imported LPG whereby the importer has to keep its selling price within the price announced by Ogra, which is equal for importers as well as those having quotas from local producers.
“Therefore, there is no room for extra profit-taking for companies depending on imports such as SLL.”
It has been noted with grave concern that some vested interests are out there to defame SSGC and SLL, accusing their employees of financial misconduct in LPG imports while also misquoting a few government investigating agencies, the Ministry of Energy and others, it said.
“These vested interests are clearly passing on frivolous information for developing news reports that are contradictory. The management of both the companies has time and again denied those assertions of ‘financial misconduct’. There are routine enquiries/ clarifications from investigating agencies based on certain complaints which are normal for any public sector SOE,” SSGC said.

4,Rupee stabilises at five-month high amid IMF talks,Pakistan poised to receive the next IMF loan tranche of $1.1 billion soon,"The Pakistani currency closed stable at a five-month high of Rs278.77 against the US dollar in the interbank market, buoyed by an uptick in the supply of foreign currency in the system. This marks the second consecutive working day of positive territory for the currency, observed on Thursday.
According to data from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the domestic currency improved by Rs0.01 on a day-to-day basis against the greenback. Consequently, the currency has cumulatively risen by 10.16% or Rs28.34 over the past six months, compared to its all-time low closing at Rs307.10/$ recorded in the first week of September 2023.
The local currency maintained a steady trend due to a better supply of dollars, with exporters continuing to sell the greenback on futures counters to prevent any significant drop in the foreign currency.
Pakistan is poised to receive the next International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan tranche of $1.1 billion soon, as an IMF team was scheduled to reach Islamabad on Thursday to conduct the final review of the domestic economy under its $3 billion loan programme, which is set to be completed in March-April 2024.
Additionally, the newly formed government in the country has unveiled plans to secure another IMF loan programme, which will be larger and longer, providing time to implement economic reforms and address chronic issues to bolster the local economy.
The new programme aims to ensure timely repayment of maturing debt and liberalise economic growth. Newly elected Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has stated that increasing exports will sustain economic growth in the medium to long run, supporting the rupee as well. However, the currency in the open market ticked down by Rs0.04 to Rs281.26/$ during the day, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP). Consequently, the disparity in the value of the rupee between the two markets widened to Rs2.49 (0.89%), well below the IMF recommended maximum limit of 1.25% (around Rs4).

5,US waiver for Iran gas pipeline project sought,"Energy minister outlines dual strategy, promises sector reforms to tackle losses","Pakistan is engaged with the US administration to obtain a waiver of US sanctions on the Iran-Pakistan (IP) Gas Pipeline Project, aiming to fulfil contractual obligations with Iran, said the federal energy minister on Thursday.
The caretaker government opted to construct a portion of the 80-kilometer pipeline within its territory to preempt potential legal disputes with Iran in international courts. Pakistan feared facing an $80 billion penalty if it lost the case in the international court, hence the decision to proceed with its portion of the pipeline while concurrently seeking a US waiver on sanctions related to the IP gas pipeline project.
Federal Minister for Energy, Dr Musadiq Masood Malik, stated during a press conference on Thursday that Pakistan has been actively pursuing a waiver from US sanctions on the IP gas pipeline project. He explained that the government is pursuing a dual strategy: seeking a waiver from US sanctions while also progressing with the construction of gas pipeline infrastructure in compliance with the Iran-Pakistan Gas Pipeline contract.
Regarding his meeting with the visiting International Monetary Fund team, he clarified that it was merely an introductory meeting, affirming that the government has met all IMF conditions related to the power sector. He reiterated that reforming the energy sector is a government priority, not an IMF condition for future generation in the country.
Malik outlined plans to introduce energy sector reforms aimed at narrowing the gap between electricity costs and sales to mitigate annual losses of Rs1,000 billion. Progress has been made on the Weighted Average Cost of Gas (WACOG), which is expected to reduce power generation costs. 
He cited Bhikki and Haveli Bahadur Shah as examples of more efficient power plants. However, the per-unit cost of electricity rose to Rs22-24 due to expensive RLNG. In contrast, the cost of electricity from local gas was Rs12, with some private companies generating electricity at Rs6 per unit.
Addressing concerns about DISCOs, the minister underscored improving their performance and efficiency by reducing electricity theft and line losses. He mentioned plans to enhance DISCOs’ operational efficiency, either through private-public partnerships or public sector interventions.
Minister Malik announced directives for public sector oil companies to establish separate entities for renewable energy, aiming to generate affordable electricity while safeguarding the environment.
In rural areas, the government plans to provide direct subsidies to farmers for fertilisers, along with high-yielding seeds and solar tube-wells to boost agricultural productivity. 
Additionally, loans will be offered for the establishment of agro-industries to maximize the utilisation of fruits and vegetables.
For urban areas, the government intends to provide IT-related training to 500,000 individuals and facilitate access to soft loans from commercial banks for small and medium enterprises.

6,"In sharp U-turn, stocks turn bullish","KSE-100 index surges 1,015.82 points, settles at 65,064.27","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday made a sharp U-turn as the KSE-100 index soared over 1,000 points, crossing the 65,000 mark in a giant leap that came in the backdrop of optimism about the last review of the International Monetary Fund’s $3 billion standby arrangement (SBA) and a reduction in bond yields.
The bourse surged as soon as trading began and the uptrend continued steadily almost throughout the day, following the commencement of government’s discussion with the IMF.
The finance ministry’s assurance of the country being in a good shape to complete the SBA and negotiate a new larger and longer loan package lifted investors’ spirit. Furthermore, the fall in Pakistan Investment Bond (PIB) yields in an auction held a day ago acted as a positive trigger and bolstered investors’ interest.
In the auction, the government raised Rs56 billion against the target of Rs190 billion, with cut-off yields decreasing by 2 to 15 basis points, indicating a policy rate cut by the State Bank in March or April. It boosted the positive sentiment and lifted the index to the intra-day high of 65,205.81 towards the close of trading.
The KSE-100 added over 1,000 points to its tally and ended trading above the 65,000 mark.
“Stocks showed sharp recovery on falling PIB yields and rupee recovery in the wake of optimism about IMF review,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Ministry of Finance’s claims to have met all targets agreed with the IMF to complete the second review under the SBA, which would clear the way for the release of a $1.1 billion tranche, played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a surge of 1,015.82 points, or 1.59%, and settled at 65,064.27.
Topline Securities, in its report, said that in Thursday’s trading session, Pakistan equities reached 65,064. “Investor optimism was fuelled by expectations of a positive outcome from the meeting with the IMF,” it said.
Additionally, the PIB auction held on Wednesday indicated the bond market’s inclination towards an anticipated rate cut in April, if not in March.
Topline Securities’ Deputy Head of Sales Ali Najeb said that the “PSX welcomed dialogue with the IMF team for the last tranche of $1.2 billion of the SBA programme as the market regained the 65,000 level and recovered all the ground lost in the previous session”.
As a result, Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum, Mari Petroleum, Meezan Bank and Pakistan State Oil collectively contributed 366 points to the index, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, noted that the “general election gap” continued to have significance as it pushed the index back above 65,000.
Tech names remained hot with Pakistan Telecommunication Company (+7.55%), Air Link Communication (+6.94%) and Systems Limited (+2.08%) gaining ground.
The report added that “66,000 remains the near-term level to overcome, and doing so will trigger the move towards new all-time highs”.
Overall trading volumes increased to 315.2 million shares against Wednesday’s tally of 252.8 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs10.5 billion.
Shares of 336 companies were traded. Of these, 248 stocks closed higher, 72 dropped and 16 remained unchanged.
WorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 42.7 million shares, gaining Rs0.08 to close at Rs1.35. It was followed by Cnergyico PK with 36.1 million shares, gaining Rs0.46 to close at Rs5.09 and Kohinoor Spinning Mills with 19.6 million shares, gaining Rs0.54 to close at Rs4.79.
Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth Rs29.9 million, according to the NCCPL.

7,PWSMA pushes for digital tax fix,"Calls for QR-Code mandate to curb billions in evasion, highlights FBR’s resistance","Plastic bag manufacturers have blamed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) for billions of rupees in annual tax evasion by major commodity producers due to malfunctioning production tracking systems.
Industry players have sought the intervention of the new Finance Minister, Muhammad Aurangzeb, who is also advocating end-to-end digitisation of the tax system to eliminate leakages.
The Polypropylene Woven Sack Manufacturers Association (PWSMA) has proposed mandatory printing of codes on plastic bags and code reader machines on production lines—a move it claims can increase the size of the formal economy by 20%.
The association has sought the intervention of the finance minister for mandatory printing of codes on plastic bags used by various manufacturing sectors. The Polypropylene Woven Sack Manufacturers Association Chairman, Iskandar Khan, has also written a letter to the finance minister.
The association has highlighted imperfections in the FBR’s track and trace system at a time when there is increased focus on digitising the FBR to discourage leakages.
On Thursday, Chairman FBR, Amjad Zubair Tiwana, briefed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on various initiatives, including digital invoices and the track and trace system.
However, the FBR seems reluctant to adopt modern technologies and all its past initiatives have failed to yield the desired results, including the track and trace system. The tracking system had been installed to capture the real sales of sugar and tobacco manufacturers.
The FBR is now looking to fill three more positions of grade 20 to strengthen its Directorate General of Digital Invoicing. A day earlier, the finance minister did not endorse the FBR’s views about filling the 5,000 vacant positions and instead asked the FBR to consider whether new investment should be made in machinery digitisation.
The success of the track and trace system depends on the automation and transfer of production data online to FBR, as the automated system for affixing paper stamps on polypropylene sugar bags for online transmission to FBR has failed, said Khan.
He revealed that the FBR has allowed manual QR-Code paper stamp affixation, which encouraged the use of counterfeit paper stamps.
The association has requested adoption of mandatory printing of QR-Codes on polypropylene bags produced for all sectors, including sugar, cement, fertiliser, feed, wheat flour, rice, and chemicals.
It supports the finance minister’s proposal for issuing digital invoices for online data transfer to FBR, which it says will help plug leakages, along with installing QR-Code readers on production lines during packaging of industrial products.
The use of QR-Code technology will eliminate rampant tax evasion and significantly increase tax revenue for the government of Pakistan. Furthermore, the digitalisation of invoices has been agreed upon by Pakistan with the IMF.
Khan said the industry was encouraged by the finance minister’s views on the digitalisation of the tax system. Plastic bag manufacturers had proposed printing QR-Codes on polypropylene bags under the Track and Trace system in 2020.
Industry players said implementation of the proposed system will eliminate the highest levels of illicit trade, which consume 20% of Pakistan’s formal economy due to high taxes, ineffective enforcement, and poor documentation. Due to this, a cash-based economy thrives at the cost of billions of rupees in tax revenue, undermining the formal tax paying sector.
Khan complained that despite industry opposition, the FBR opted to affix imported QR-Code printed paper stamps for the sugar industry under the track and trace system, instead of printing QR-Codes on Polypropylene bags during their production at polypropylene factories, supported with digital invoices.
Many industries maintain two sets of accounts, one for tax purposes and the second showing real production and sales. FBR’s old plans to capture real incomes through tracking sales have not helped broaden the tax base and collection.

8,Seafood exports to China surge by 13%,"Rising demand, strategic partnerships drive growth in trade, says official","Pakistan’s seafood exports to China increased by 13% in 2023 compared to the previous year. The rise is due to the growing demand for seafood products in China, a trend that has been steadily increasing over the past few years, according to Ghulam Qadir, Investment and Trade Counsellor at the Pakistan Embassy in Beijing.
Qadir noted that Pakistan’s seafood exports to China reached $247.3 million, marking a 13% increase for the January-December period in 2023 year-on-year. In 2022, exports were valued at $219.3 million, while in 2021, they stood at $139.29 million, as per data from the General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China (GACC).
“This growth can be attributed to various factors, such as improved trade relations between the two countries, participation in the China Fisheries and Seafood Expo held in Qingdao last year by a large group of Pakistani fisheries companies, and the implementation of efficient supply chain management strategies in the Pakistani seafood industry,” the counsellor elaborated.
Qadir informed that, according to GACC, exports of frozen fish crossed $60.63 million in 2023. Fresh/chilled crabs saw an increase to $42.59 million and exports of frozen cuttlefish reached $34.93 million from Pakistan to China in 2023.
He also highlighted that Pakistan organised the International Food and Agriculture Exhibition in Karachi last year, where a significant number of Chinese, particularly from the seafood association, participated to explore the Pakistani market.

9,SBP expected to maintain rates at record 22%,Analysts eye rate cuts in Q2 2024 as CPI rises 23.1% YoY,"Pakistan’s central bank is widely expected to hold its key interest rate at a record 22% for the sixth straight policy meeting on Monday as inflation risks continue to loom, but a majority of analysts expect rate cuts from the second quarter of this year.
Monday’s policy decision would be the last ahead of the April expiry of a $3 billion Stand-By Arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The median estimate in a Reuters poll of 17 analysts predicts the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) will hold rates steady.
Three analysts are forecasting a 100-basis-point (bps) cut, while one expects a 25-bps cut on Monday. Fourteen of those surveyed expect a rate cut in the April-June quarter.
Pakistan’s key rate was last raised in June to fight persistent inflationary pressures and to meet one of the conditions set by the IMF for securing the bailout.
The country’s consumer price index (CPI) for February rose 23.1% year-on-year, its slowest rate since June 2022, partly due to the “base effect”.
“Several inflationary risks loom large, including the potential implementation of sales tax on petroleum products, heightened food inflation during Ramazan, and the prospect of entering a new IMF programme,” said Saad Hanif, Deputy Head of Research at Ismail Iqbal Securities.
In January, the central bank raised the average inflation forecast for the fiscal year ending in June to 23%-25%, from a previous projection of 20%-22%, due to rising gas and electricity prices.
Inflation hit an all-time high of 38% in May last year, driven partly by new taxation measures imposed to comply with IMF’s demands for a rescue programme that helped the nation avert a sovereign debt default.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb during a recent interview with local media outlet Geo News said, “I do think during the course of this year, we will see the rates coming down”.
Mustafa Pasha, Chief Investment Officer at Lakson Investments, said the chances of a rate cut are materially growing with each monetary policy meeting.
“We expect a symbolic cut of around 100 odd bps over Q2 of 2024, with the more aggressive moves coming in the back end of the year,” Pasha said.
