4,Real estate amnesty scheme faces audit,ICAP-certified firms to validate certificates submitted by builders and developers,"The federal government has decided to audit the completion certificates submitted by builders and developers who benefited from the amnesty scheme offered for the real estate sector during the PTI’s rule.
In this regard, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has notified the chartered accountancy companies rated satisfactory after their quality control review by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Pakistan (ICAP).
The beneficiaries of the amnesty scheme were not asked about their sources of income, and they were also given tax exemptions and concessions to the tune of billions of rupees.
When contacted, a senior officer of the FBR revealed that during the PTI’s rule, the tax amnesty scheme was introduced for developers and builders completing projects within a specified period in the real estate sector.
Under this amnesty scheme, eligibility criteria were established for developers and builders to avail tax exemptions and concessions. According to the criteria, developers and builders were required to have sold at least fifty percent of the plots and completed the sale proceedings for at least forty percent of the plots, houses, or flats.
Similarly, it was necessary for developers and builders to obtain certificates from the National Engineering Services Pakistan (Nespak) regarding completion of road infrastructure for at least fifty percent of residential and commercial projects.
Read Amnesty ‘alarmed’ by pre-polls unrest in Pakistan
In accordance with these eligibility criteria, developers and builders were mandated to obtain compliance certificates, and it was obligatory to verify these certificates from the chartered accountancy firms rated satisfactory by ICAP after quality control review.
Officials said the legal requirements for verifying the completion certificates of real estate sector investors benefiting from the amnesty scheme were not fulfilled as the FBR did not notify the audit firms rated satisfactory by ICAP.
They said in order to fulfill this legal requirement, the FBR has now certified the chartered accountant companies rated satisfactory by ICAP to validate the completion certificates.
The firms that received a satisfactory rating in ICAP’s quality control review after September 30, 2023, will be able to attest to the completion certificate submitted by the builders and developers who benefited from the amnesty scheme.
The builders and developers whose certificates are verified will continue to get tax relief. However, if the completion certificates cannot be verified or if they do not meet the eligibility criteria, they will not be granted tax relief.
Additionally, taxes will be levied against them, and legal action will be taken in accordance with the law. They may also be questioned about their sources of income.

6,"All eyes on race for Punjab, K-P governor slots",PPP still holding its cards but Kaira and Kundi frontrunners for these posts,"As the PPP leadership continues to hold its card over the candidates for Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa governors, it has largely become a one-horse race in the former though a senior party leader indicated that a surprise nominee should not be ruled out in both the provinces.
With presidential elections sorted out, something that the PPP wanted to deal with prior to finalising their picks for the Punjab and K-P governors -- the two positions offered to the party as part of the power-sharing formula with the PML-N -- the announcement of the names for the slots is now expected in another two days or so.
Punjab, which remains a more politically advantageous appointment for the party than K-P, initially had four candidates in the run, namely Makhdum Syed Ahmed Mahmud, Qamar Zaman Kaira, Nadeem Afzal Chan, and Chaudary Riaz.
However, Mahmud, who has already served as a governor once, is not interested in the post and pulled himself out the race, according to well-placed sources.
Chan, given his recent re-entry into the PPP from the PTI has inherent disadvantages despite being in good books of the party leadership.
Similarly, a PPP leader said Riaz, a relatively less known political figure in this race, was unlikely to be considered for this position. This leaves Kaira as the candidate with the bright chances of making it to the office.
Another plus for Kaira that puts him ahead of everyone else is that he is in good books of not only his party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari but also the ‘powerful circles’ as well as the PML-N, according to the sources.

However, the sources said Kaira being “overly” comfortable with the PML-N could be a setback for him.
They added that during the last coalition government, Kaira defended PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif better than his own people, raising many eyebrows about his future in the party. But a PPP leader described Kaira as a learned, soft-spoken and a down-to-earth person, who would in the capacity of the Punjab governor help the party make inroads in the province.
 
He said Mahmud was not the kind of the person, who would keep the doors of the Governor’s House open for the party activists all the time and that placed him at a great disadvantage.
The vibrant and relativity young PPP leader, Faisal Karim Kundi, is likely to bag the post of the K-P governor.
In K-P, Kundi has mettle it to take on not only the PTI but also the JUI-F. Also in the race for the slot is PPP’s K-P President Mohammad Ali Shah Bacha, former minister Zahir Ali Shah, Barrister Masood Kausar, and Khawaja Yawar Naseer.
A senior PPP leader from Sindh said the decision about the governorship of Punjab and K-P rested with party co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari.
She said it could be someone from among the names being quoted by the media or entirely somebody else.
When asked about the Sindh governor, she it would be up to the PML-N to pick its candidate as they had an understanding with its senior coalition partner that it should have this position.
However, she was unaware as to whether the PMLN would field its own candidate or offer this position to the MQM-P.

7,President calls for healing divisions in society,Zardari hails Shehbaz-Gandapur interaction,"President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday hailed the recent meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, saying it was time to begin the process of healing the divisions, restoring confidence in democracy and keeping Pakistan above all.
The president’s message is being viewed as an attempt to curb polarisation and ‘political sectarianism’ in society.
The president’s statement has come in connection with the ice-breaking development wherein the K-P chief minister held a meeting with Shehbaz Sharif on March13 in which he asked the premier, who is also the PML-N president, to politically engage with his party’s founder Imran Khan.
“It is high time we start thinking of working towards healing the divisions Pakistan has been going through,” the president said while welcoming the interaction.
In a statement, the president said that he had always advocated for prioritising Pakistan above all else, and it was time we gave people hope in the democratic process by showing them it could work. “This outreach is a good beginning,” Zardari stated.

Also, PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique said that major political parties of the country — including his own, the PPP and the PTI — would have to “accept each other”.
In a post on X, he referred to the recent meeting between KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and PM Shehbaz Sharif, terming it a “step in the right direction”.
Rafique said, “The pulse of the country is drowning in the game of putting each other down.”
Asserting that the PML-N and the PPP had “buried the game full of hatred”, he criticised ex-premier Imran Khan for indulging in the same “game” and involving others in it.
Rafique said: “[We] will have to accept each other. Dialogue with rival parties on state matters should continue.”
The contact between the two political opponents has rekindled the hope of reconciliation and raised the hopes of lowering the political temperature, which intensified amid rigging allegations and calls for protest against the government.
Meanwhile, PTI leader Hammad Azhar has said that K-P Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should not be considered an indication of “any compromise on the theft of Imran Khan’s or the public’s mandate”.
In a post on X, Azhar said, “Firstly, Ali Amin would never do so and even if he does, he himself knows the emotions of the public and the party. “Thousands of our people (workers) are currently unjustly imprisoned and half of the national and Punjab assemblies are fake,” he claimed. “This is no small matter.”

9,"PTI, SIC drift apart amid Raza, Marwat slugfest","Many people won’t be able to show their faces if I open my mouth, SIC chief responds to PTI leader’s criticism"," 
In a dramatic turn of events within the political landscape of the country, Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) chief Sahibzada Hamid Raza has issued a vehement response to remarks made by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Sher Afzal Marwat, igniting a fresh wave of controversy and intraparty tensions.
Marwat, known for his outspoken demeanor, aired his grievances against the PTI's alliance with SIC during a recent appearance on a private TV channel. Labeling the partnership with SIC as a 'mistake,' Marwat cited internal party dynamics, highlighting purported directives from incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan regarding alliances.
During his televised interview, Marwat divulged details regarding the internal deliberations within PTI, alleging that Imran Khan had initially directed the party to align with the Shirani group. However, Marwat claimed that discussions suddenly shifted towards an alliance with Hamid Raza's party, despite purported readiness from Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Shirani for an unconditional alliance with PTI.
Marwat further asserted that had PTI forged an alliance with the Shirani group as per Khan's directives, the party would not have faced setbacks concerning electoral symbols and reserved seats.
Responding to Marwat's accusations, Raza took to X, formerly Twitter, on Friday to rebuke the PTI leader's claims. Raza vehemently denied soliciting PTI for an alliance, asserting that the decision was exclusively made by PTI founder Imran Khan.
Expressing his willingness to address the intricacies of the alliance, Raza hinted at holding back criticisms out of respect for Khan and dismissed Marwat's statements as attempts at media sensationalism.

“From election symbols to reserved seats, I have a lot to say,” remarked Raza, adding that “if I also sit in talk shows and say something, many people will not be able to show their faces.”
He said that his commitment is with Imran Khan and will always be, adding that he can't think bad of Khan for the useless media publicity, “that's why I am silent”.
“Don’t sow discord by taking instructions,” he maintained without elaborating.
Raza's discontent over Marwat's comments manifested in his conspicuous absence from an event organised by PTI addressing Islamophobia today. Sources revealed that Raza had received an official invitation from PTI for the event, where he was also slated to speak. However, Marwat's remarks purportedly deterred Raza from attending, signaling escalating tensions between the two parties.
Raza had also voiced his grievances during a PTI core committee meeting held yesterday, further exacerbating tensions within the party. The meeting, attended by prominent PTI members including Latif Khosa, Salman Akram Raja, Shoaib Shaheen, and Sher Afzal Marwat, witnessed heated exchanges and clashes among top leaders, leading to the premature departure of several members.
