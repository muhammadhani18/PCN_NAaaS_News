On Saturday, the province witnessed multiple accidents resulting in 23 fatalities, including 14 children, and 34 injuries. Peshawar, the provincial capital, experienced intermittent rain causing flooding in low-lying areas, while upper regions remained cut off due to heavy snowfall, exacerbating the difficulties faced by residents and authorities alike.
Efforts to reopen closed roads have commenced, although continuous snowfall is hampering progress. The PDMA reports numerous houses damaged, with casualties including animals buried under debris, adding to the woes of affected communities.
The Meteorological Department forecasts continued rain and snow until Sunday, underscoring the urgency of ongoing rescue and relief operations.
Tragically, three lives were lost in a landslide incident in Lower Dir. Among the deceased were 25-year-old Zahid, son of Sher Maula, his 23-year-old wife, and five-year-old Harira, while three-year-old Arham Umar was injured.

9,Sehat card restoration from 1st of Ramazan,K-P government to pay Rs3b monthly to health insurer for free treatment resumption,"Medical Teaching Institute (MTI) hospitals are set to resume free treatment under Sehat Insaf Card in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa from 1st Ramzan
The provincial government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa has announced the reinstatement of free treatment facilities under the scheme across the region.
Sehat Insaf Card, a flagship project of the previous Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government in the province, faced criticism upon its suspension, drawing attention from locals.
In a significant move, the K-P government has allocated Rs5 billion for payment to the State Life Insurance Company, aiming to settle outstanding dues and restore treatment services.
Official sources told The Express Tribune that the provincial government owes Rs17 billion to the insurance company, with plans to initially release Rs5 billion followed by monthly instalments of Rs3 billion until the full amount is cleared.
An official from the health department assured this correspondent that all necessary arrangements have been finalized, emphasizing the government’s commitment to reversing the decision made by the caretaker government. The restoration of free treatment facilities is scheduled to commence from the 1st of Ramazan.
However, it’s noted that initially, only 85% of healthcare services will be reinstated, with procedures such as kidney and liver transplants subject to approval from the provincial cabinet.
The suspension of treatment on the Sehat Card last year, attributed to financial constraints, impacted services across the province, with only cancer and kidney dialysis treatments being provided free of charge under the caretaker government’s reduced scheme, significantly reducing monthly expenses.
The restoration of free treatment is expected to benefit approximately 10.2 million families across the region. Notably, there are 119 hospitals enlisted on the Sehat Card panel, including 60 public sector hospitals, with MTI hospitals also set to resume free treatment following the settlement of dues with the insurance company.
Background
In October of last year, the State Life Insurance Company ceased payment of claims to public sector hospitals operating under the Sehat Card scheme. This abrupt halt significantly impacted the revenue of these hospitals, including the Medical Teaching Institute (MTI) hospitals.
Official sources revealed that due to this financial setback, public sector hospitals struggled to procure essential medicines and provide necessary free treatment to patients. An official explained that the insurance company formally communicated to the chief of the Social Health Protection Initiative, stating that the outstanding dues under the Sehat Card had accumulated to a staggering Rs30 billion. The insurance company insisted that claims would only be settled upon the release of funds by the provincial government.
The insurance company specifically demanded that the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government disburse at least Rs10 billion in funds.
