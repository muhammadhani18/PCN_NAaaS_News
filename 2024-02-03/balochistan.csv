The problem of drug abuse is likely to explode in the next decade, particularly affecting children under the age of 14, adding, that the impact of the increasing drug abuse will be seen in both urban and rural areas of the country due to the busy schedules of parents and excessive use of digital gadgets.
He said the adverse effects of drug abuse are immense and it not only harms the brain but other organs of the body which soon loses immunity to fight disease.

The officers and personnel of all 28 government departments, including education, health, municipal corporation, district council, and social welfare, have been included in the polling duty.
The general elections are only five days away, which are scheduled for February 8. However, since there isn't an election campaign this time, all major political parties are not getting polling agents for polling stations. It is extremely difficult for candidates to appoint female polling agents. This time, the activists of the political parties have refused to allow their female family members to work as polling agents.
Subsequently, candidates have started offering an honorarium of Rs5,000 to female polling agents besides providing free breakfast at 6:30 am, lunch in the afternoon, tea and biscuits twice a day, and roasted gram, and desi ghee on the polling day.

6,Key public hospitals secure PHC licence,Health regulator implements sweeping measures against unlawful medical facilities,"In a significant development for public health, the Punjab Healthcare Commission (PHC) has officially granted licences to three prominent government hospitals in Rawalpindi.
After years of non-compliance with health indicators, Benazir Bhutto General Hospital (BBH), Holy Family Hospital (HFH), and District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital have successfully met the criteria, marking an end to their struggles since 2012.
Previously, these hospitals faced fines of Rs120,000 each for failing to fulfil the PHC’s health indicators. The criteria included evaluating the doctor’s approach towards patients, the healthcare facility’s environment, availability of essential utilities, comfortable waiting areas, medication supply and laboratory facilities. The prolonged delays and patient complaints about treatment methods prompted the fines.
Finally, the three hospitals were issued formal licences after they completed the health indicators set by the PHC. These hospitals were operating without the PHC’s issued licence. On the other hand, the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology (RIC) has been issued a formal licence by the Commission.
As part of its broader initiative, the PHC has initiated a crackdown on unlicensed medical facilities, including quacks and private laboratories setting up clinics without proper permits. To further reinforce its stance, the Commission has suspended medical treatment using health cards at hospitals lacking licences, whether government or private.

The PHC’s vigilance extends beyond hospitals, with a focus on quacks in streets and bazaars, particularly those linked to dangerous diseases. The Commission is actively addressing citizen complaints lodged on the web portals of the prime minister and the Punjab chief minister, indicating a commitment to public well-being.
Moreover, the PHC has begun imposing fines and sealing unregistered medical treatment centres that have not met health indicators.
Taking a stringent approach, legal actions, including imprisonment and fines, are being pursued against medical professionals found negligent in patient care or causing complications leading to deaths. Private laboratories are not exempt from scrutiny, as legal actions have been initiated against those failing to register with the PHC.
Field experts from the Commission conduct thorough inspections before granting registration to government and private hospitals, medical centres, laboratories, and clinics, imposing substantial fines for non-compliance with health indicators.
This comprehensive approach reflects the PHC’s dedication to ensuring the highest standards of healthcare for the citizens of Rawalpindi.

7,Voters question performance of NA-54 hopefuls,Locals say Ghulam Sarwar Khan of IPP and independent candidate Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan to have close contest,"Residents of Islamabad’s NA-54 constituency are expressing scepticism about the past performance of candidates competing in the February 8 general elections, saying political bigwigs had always put the provision of basic facilities on the back burner and broke electoral promises.
They are of the view that the elections are usually contested on tall claims of paving roads and streets, providing better education and health facilities, offering jobs, and executing other development works.
A survey conducted by The Express Tribune in the constituency exposes the performance of political heavyweights like former federal ministers Ghulam Sarwar Khan and Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.
Both politicians are face to face in NA-54 – the territorial jurisdiction of which starts from the Margalla Hills to the Attock’s Kala Chitta Pahar, and the banks of Swan River to the areas of Chakri and Adiala.
According to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the total number of registered voters in this constituency is 466,344, of which 241,350 are male voters and 224,994 are female voters. As many as 39 candidates are contesting the elections from NA-54, 30 candidates from PP-12, and 28 candidates will come face-to-face in the PP-13 constituency.
According to locals, the close contest will take place between Ghulam Sarwar Khan of Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) and independent candidate Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan. Sarwar quit the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI), while Nisar parted ways with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and is now contesting the elections as an independent candidate for the second time. Both aspirants are seen seeking public votes based on their past performance in their respective electrical campaigns.
On the other hand, the main contest for the provincial seat (PP-12) is expected between Mohsin Ayub of the PML-N, Ammar Siddiq Khan of the IPP, and Saad Ali Khan of the PTI. In PP-13, the PML-N-backed Malik Umar Farooq will step into the electoral battlefield to face the PTI’s Fahad Masood.

Locals have complained of a lack of basic facilities in the constituency. Azhar Hussain Qazi describes the pathetic condition of Primary School Paswal located in the native village of Ghulam Sarwar. He says the students are taking classes despite the school’s building having been declared dangerous by the building department. Some students told this reporter that they are forced to study in the open air amid cold weather.
Local people say that despite enjoying several ministries, Sarwar could not change the condition of the primary school and Basic Health Center of Pind Noushhari. They further say that both the candidates were also unable to fix encroachment problems at Chowk Sarai Kala Taxila. Usman Aziz says traffic jams, drainage and lack of a permanent place for vendors in Taxila Chowk are acute problems in the last ten years.
Tauqeer Riaz says that the 500-bed Wah General Hospital built at the cost of billions of rupees during the tenure of Nisar Ali Khan even lacks doctors and laboratory tests.
The voters in the constituency are of the view that the real change is still a distant dream as candidates seek to vote in the name of changing the fate of the constituency by solving the people’s problems, but break promises always.

8,Independents surge in Peshawar elections,Electioneering peaks in newly merged tribal districts,"In the lead-up to the impending general elections, the political arena in the Peshawar district finds itself amidst a formidable challenge, with approximately 195 independent candidates stepping forward to contend against established political heavyweights. This surge in independent contenders presents a significant shake-up, posing a formidable threat to traditional party lines by diverting crucial votes and intensifying the competition.
Data obtained by The Express Tribune reveals a total of 349 candidates vying for 13 provincial assembly and five National Assembly seats within the district, with independent candidates constituting a notable proportion. The campaign landscape is marked by a fervent door-to-door outreach by these independents, engaging in a relentless effort to sway voters with their individual platforms and promises.
Political observers keenly note the often underestimated role of independent candidates during election campaigns, highlighting their potential to wield considerable influence in the subsequent government formation process. Historically, independent members have played pivotal roles in coalition-building, often aligning with ruling parties post-elections to leverage their support in exchange for policy concessions or ministerial positions.

Meanwhile, with the countdown to the February 8 elections rapidly ticking away, electioneering has reached its crescendo across the seven merged tribal districts.
Candidates representing various political affiliations are leaving no stone unturned in their efforts to mobilize support, conducting large tribal gatherings, impassioned rallies, and extensive grassroots engagement to court voters.
The forthcoming elections mark a historic moment for tribal communities, as they prepare to cast their votes for both National Assembly and provincial assembly seats for the first time in their storied history. Excitement and anticipation run high among voters, eager to fulfill their civic duties alongside family and friends, in what promises to be a significant milestone in their democratic journey.
Asghar Afridi from Bara, highlights their collective resolve to journey to the polling stations in groups, accompanied by families and friends, to discharge their national obligations.
