1,Fresh youth set to flex voting muscles,First-time voters wield power to tip scales for any political heavyweight,"As the nation goes to ballots in a few days, a wave of fresh energy is about to hit the polling as more than 20 million of youth are set to make their debut in the voting.
Analysts say that the influx of first-time voters has the potential to shape the political landscape, making every vote count and propelling any political party to the coveted seat of power.
The predominant demographic in Pakistan comprises the youth, constituting 64% of the total registered voters, while a recent data from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) indicates a significant rise in youth voters, reaching 56.86 million from 46.43 million in 2018.
This surge, amounting to an increase of 10.42 million within approximately six years, puts this demographic behind the game-changer wheel capable of steering the outcome of the upcoming general elections.
Positioned at the nexus of political influence, this dynamic demographic holds the potential to sway the fortunes of any political heavyweight. As contenders vie for power, they zero in on capturing the hearts and votes of this influential group, placing them squarely in the spotlight of the political arena.
Civil society, government and others have long called for educating and encouraging the youth to step out on the polling day and flex their voting muscles.
The first crucial step in this civic journey involves presenting the original national identity card to the polling officer, who cross-checks details against the electoral roll.
Names and serial numbers are announced aloud to the polling agents, and subsequent thumb impressions are taken by an indelible ink mark on the voter's thumb.
As the process advances to the next stage, assistant presiding officers sign and seal the back of the ballot papers. A green-coloured ballot paper is designated for the National Assembly, while a white counterpart is earmarked for a provincial assembly.
Behind the voting screen, voters are tasked with accurately stamping the election mark of their chosen candidate on the respective ballot papers.
The responsibility then shifts to ensuring that the green ballot paper finds its place in the designated ballot box with the matching green lid, while the white ballot paper goes into the box with the white lid.
Before venturing to the polling station, voters are advised to adhere to some crucial instructions. Bringing the original national identity card is imperative, with expired cards also deemed acceptable.
Furthermore, the sanctity of the voting process must be upheld by refraining from bringing mobile phones and cameras into the polling station.
The voting window is set to open at 8 am and conclude at 6 pm. Notably, even after the scheduled polling time concludes, voters within the polling station will still have the opportunity to cast their ballots.

3,Export processing zone to be set up on PSM land,Stakeholders Group warns decision will have ‘disastrous consequences’,"The caretaker Sindh government has agreed to set up a modern export processing zone on the land of the Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) but the public entity’s Stakeholders Group has expressed concerns over the move, requesting that interim Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar should review the decision.
The interim federal industries and production ministry in a letter sent to the Sindh chief secretary has sought a written approval for the establishment of a modern export processing zone on the land.
According to sources, during a meeting held in Karachi on December 28, caretaker Sindh Chief Minister Justice (retd) Maqbool Baqar and interim Federal Minister for Industries and Commerce Dr Gohar Ejaz decided to establish a modern export processing zone on the land of the PSM.
The Sindh chief secretary, principal secretary to the interim Sindh CM, federal industries ministry secretary and chairman of the Trading Corporation of Pakistan also participated in this meeting.
In the huddle, the caretaker Sindh chief minister asked the interim federal government to write an official letter to the province seeking its consent for the proposal to set up an export processing zone on the PSM land.
He also assured the interim federal minister that in response to this letter, the caretaker Sindh government would agree to the proposal.
The sources said in this connection, the caretaker interim federal industries and production ministry sent a letter to the interim Sindh government on January 31, 2024, seeking the formal its consent for the move.
An area of more than 10,000 acres has been reserved for the PSM plant at present.
The PSM has been removed from the privatisation list and a plan for its rehabilitation has been given the nod.

However, the Pakistan Steel Mills Corporation (PSMC) Stakeholders Group has expressed its concern over the decision and appealed to the caretaker premier to reconsider the proposal.
PSMC Stakeholders Group Convener Mumrez Khan wrote a letter to the caretaker premier, interim federal industries and production ministry’s additional secretary in-charge, and SIFC secretary, warning that the establishment of a processing zone on the land of the PSM would have disastrous financial consequences for the institution.
He added that this type of zone could be built anywhere in the country, but it would not be possible to relocate the PSM to any other place.
Khan argued that reviving the PSM to provide raw material at competitive prices to the engineering industry and construction sector was essential to bring the country out of the current economic crisis.
He attributed the PSM losing Rs100 million per day because of production losses, which included 80% markup and surcharges, to the decision of not appointing a qualified board of directors comprising of professional experts.
In the letter, the SIFC was also urged not to repeat the mistakes of the previous governments because of which the country’s economy suffered a blow of $15 billion between 2008 and 2023, while the PSM’s losses stood at Rs700 billion, including payments and dues.
The convener further referred to the decision of the Supreme Court on November 18, 2019 that the federal industries ministry could not sell the land of the PSM, and according to the law its premises could only be used for a steel mill or related industries.

4,HRCP concerned over verdict in Imran’s marriage case,Says decision has troubling implications for people's right to privacy," 
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) n Saturday expressed grave concern over a court's verdict, sentencing former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to seven years' imprisonment on charges of contracting an “unlawful” marriage.
According to a statement issued by the HRCP, the verdict has troubling implications for people's right to privacy, particularly women's right to dignity during court proceedings and to make decisions about divorce and marriage without the intrusion of the state.
This could also set a precedent for Section 496 to be weaponised for political purposes.
“The fact that a politician who has fallen out of favour with the establishment has now been convicted four times over in five months in a series of trials that raise serious questions as to the due process, right to counsel and fair trial, is a sobering reflection on the state of democracy in Pakistan.”
