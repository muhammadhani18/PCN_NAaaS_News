0,Trade deficit shrinks to $13.1b,$6.4 billion cut in deficit now equals 78% of existing foreign exchange reserves,"Pakistan’s trade deficit shrank to $13.1 billion during the first seven months of this fiscal year, which is $6.4 billion less than the same period of the last fiscal year. This development offsets pressure on the exchange rate market amid thin foreign exchange reserves.
During the July-January period of this fiscal year, the gap between imports and exports amounted to $13.2 billion, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. The trade deficit was $6.4 billion, over 33% less than the comparative period of the last fiscal year, it added. The $6.4 billion cut in the deficit now equals 78% of the existing foreign exchange reserves.
Pakistan has been struggling to secure non-debt creating inflows on a sustainable basis aimed at lessening its dependence on foreign debt. The country needs an average of $25 billion to $30 billion every year for at least the next three years to repay maturing debt and finance the current account deficit.
Despite major injections by international financial institutions, foreign exchange reserves remain low, standing at $8.2 billion. These reserves are sufficient to finance less than one and a half months of imports and are far below the safe benchmark of three-month cover.
Last month, Pakistan requested China to extend the $2 billion maturing loan for another one year due to its inability to pay back the amount. The caretaker government of July 2018 had taken this loan for one year, but since then, it has been rolled over every year.
The country has sought the extension on existing terms. The Chinese loan is maturing on March 23rd, and Pakistan is paying an interest rate equal to 7.1%, making it one of the most expensive borrowings. The $1 billion similar loan from the United Arab Emirates had been taken at a 6.5% rate.
Imports during the first seven months of this fiscal year remained at $31 billion, down by $5.1 billion or over 14%, according to the national data collecting agency. The government has hoped to contain imports to less than $55 billion and to earn $30 billion in exports during the current fiscal year. This still leaves it with a gap of $25 billion to be bridged through foreign remittances.

The continued tight control over imports has lessened the pressure on foreign exchange reserves. The low available financing leaves the government with no option but to keep managing international trade.
The latest statistics indicate that imports may now even remain lower than the already downward revised projections by the global lender. Imports during the first seven months were equal to only 53% of the new IMF projection.
The PBS stated that exports picked up during the July-January period and stood at $17.8 billion. There was a $1.3 billion addition in exports in seven months, showing an increase of nearly 8%. The seven months’ exports were equal to 58% of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s downward revised projection of $30.6 billion.
On a yearly basis, there was also a reduction in the trade deficit, thanks to better performance of exports.
The gap between export receipts and import payments shrank to $1.94 billion in January over a year ago, reported the PBS. In absolute terms, there was a $642 million cut in the deficit, nearly equal to the last IMF loan tranche, due to a combination of a healthy trend in exports and tight control over imports.
On a year-on-year basis, in January, exports amounted to $2.8 billion, higher by $553 million, or one-fourth, compared to the same month of last year. But the exports were slightly lower than the preceding month.
Imports dropped 1.8% and remained at $4.7 billion last month. As a result, the trade deficit narrowed one-fourth to $1.94 billion in January.
On a month-on-month basis, the trade deficit widened by 6.5%. Exports shrank 1.1%, just under $2.8 billion last month compared to December. Imports also nominally increased.

1,"Malaysia buys more rice, frozen food",CG shows interest in increasing engagements with businessmen,"Malaysian Consul General Herman Hardynata bin Ahmad has said although trade with Pakistan is largely in favour of Malaysia, Pakistan’s share is improving as Kuala Lumpur has increased purchases of rice and frozen food.
“Malaysia’s exports to Pakistan mainly comprise palm oil, but we are unable to completely meet the South Asian nation’s growing demand despite the fact that we have been producing palm oil at peak capacity,” he said at a meeting during his visit to the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI). “Malaysia is a small country and in terms of palm oil, our production is limited.”
He expressed keen interest in engaging in maximum number of meetings with the business community of Karachi in a bid to strengthen trade and investment ties. He said both countries had been cooperating with each other not only in trade but also in the area of defence with Malaysia sending its defence officials for training in Pakistan. Also, Pakistani personnel of the armed forces are sent to Malaysia for imparting training.
“Apart from enhancing trade, there are many opportunities in other sectors as well including tourism, capacity building and the likes,” he said.

Earlier, KCCI President Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh stressed that both the countries had a strong and diversified bilateral economic relationship in various areas of mutual interest.
“Despite strong brotherly ties, the bilateral trade volume remains below its true potential as Pakistan’s exports to Malaysia currently stand around $300 million, which need to be enhanced to reasonable levels,” he said.
“It is imperative for Pakistan to pursue economic integration with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) having collective GDP size of $3.6 trillion.”

2,PM gives green light for PARCO MD hiring,Summary sent to cabinet for formal approval of MD’s appointment,"Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar has given the green light to appoint Irteza Qureshi as the new regular managing director of Pak Arab Refinery Limited (Parco).
He is currently working as the deputy managing director (DMD). According to sources, eight potential candidates had been shortlisted during the first phase for the slot of Parco MD.
Two candidates were from the Engro Group, one from contractor company Schlumberger, two from Parco, one from K-Electric and one from Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC).
In the final phase, the government shortlisted three candidates, who included SSGC MD, Schlumberger CEO and Parco DMD Irteza Qureshi.
Sources pointed out that the candidate from the contracting company could not be hired due to the conflict of interests whereas the SSGC MD had been allowed by the company’s board to continue his services.
Consequently, one candidate was left with a professional background, who had earlier been working in the country’s largest oil and gas explorer – Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) – and is currently working in Parco.
Sources said that the Petroleum Division had submitted a summary to the prime minister, who gave the nod for appointing the Parco DMD as the new MD. He also gave directives to table a case before the cabinet for formal approval.
Later, a summary was sent to the cabinet, which is expected to accord its approval next week.

The board of directors of Parco, a joint venture between Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), had earlier approved the hiring of Qureshi as the DMD, who took charge in early September 2021.
Having served as the chief financial officer (CFO) in OGDCL, Qureshi, a UK-qualified chartered accountant, brings diverse experience in both private and public sectors as well as multinational organisations within and outside of Pakistan.
His tenure at OGDCL saw significant achievements, including value creation, enhanced governance and financial control.
As the CFO, he played a pivotal role in implementing major HR reforms, achieved operational efficiencies and focused on diversification, resulting in substantial savings, estimated at Rs150 billion over a period of 10 years due to measures like “pensionable employment cessation” and salary capping.
OGDCL experienced a considerable reduction in procurement costs and benefited from lowered service rates by up to 50%, leading to significant savings in the company’s finances.
Parco, established in 1974, is likely to benefit from Qureshi’s expertise for future growth and success of the company.

3,Businessmen condemn POL price hike,Criticise govt for maintaining maximum limit of Rs60 per litre in petroleum levy,"In a move met with strong resistance, the caretaker government’s decision to significantly raise petroleum product prices has sparked serious concerns among business leaders. The move, denounced by various industry representatives, is anticipated to escalate inflation, posing further challenges to industrial production in the country.
The recent hike in petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) prices by Rs13.55 and Rs2.75 per litre, respectively, has set petroleum product rates at Rs272.89 and Rs278.96 per litre.
Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), President, Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh, expressed dismay, stating that while an increase of Rs5 to Rs9 per litre was expected due to rising international prices, the unjustifiable spike of Rs13.55 per litre would disproportionately impact all segments of society. Sheikh warned that this move would exacerbate hardships for the general public and significantly affect industrial production, as the cost of doing business would inevitably rise.

The KCCI president criticised the government for maintaining the maximum permissible limit of Rs60 per litre in petroleum levy, suggesting that reducing this levy could have mitigated the impact on the public. He denounced the caretaker government’s consistent pattern of making harsh decisions, including raising petrol, gas, and electricity prices, as unacceptable.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, President of the Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI), Adeel Siddiqui warned that the petrol price hike would negatively impact the national economy, leading to increased charges for freight transportation services and electricity. He expressed concern for SMEs on the brink of collapse due to escalating utility bills and water shortages.

4,NEPRA approves tariff hike of Rs4.567/unit,"Power consumers to bear burden of approximately Rs33.88b, along with 18% GST","The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) has granted approval for state-run power distribution companies (Discos) to impose an additional charge of Rs4.567 per unit on the bills of power customers for February 2024. This tariff increase, approved on Friday, is in response to fuel cost adjustments (FCA) from December 2023.
Consumers are expected to face a financial burden of approximately Rs33.88 billion due to this decision, and when factoring in the 18% General Sales Tax (GST), the total may rise to nearly Rs40 billion. It is crucial to note that this tariff hike applies to all consumer categories, excluding Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and Lifeline consumers.
The central power purchasing agency (CPPA), representing Discos, had filed a petition stating that in December 2023, consumers were charged a reference fuel cost of Rs5.4031 per unit, while the actual fuel cost incurred was Rs11.0225 per unit. The CPPA argued that the additional cost burden of Rs5.6194 per unit should be transferred to consumers.
After a public hearing on Wednesday, NEPRA conducted a detailed calculation of data and approved an increase of Rs4.567 per unit on Friday.
According to CPPA data submitted to the regulatory authority, 7,726 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity was generated in December 2023, costing Rs78.3 billion (equivalent to Rs10.134 per unit). Out of this, 7,418 GWh, originally priced at Rs81.767 billion, was delivered to distribution companies (Discos), with transmission losses standing at 3.51%.
Comparing December 2023 to the same month in the previous year, power generation saw an 8.21% decrease. However, there was a 2.37% increase in generation compared to the previous month (November 2023).
The generation cost per unit increased significantly, rising by a worrisome 44% to Rs10.134 per unit year-on-year in December 2023 from Rs7.044 per unit in December 2022. Similarly, compared to the previous month (November 2023, unit cost of Rs7.17), there was a 41.3% increase.

The per-unit power generation cost from imported coal surged by 18.7% in December 2023 to Rs17.2525/unit from Rs14.5305/unit in November 2023. Meanwhile, the cost of local coal generation remained unchanged at Rs12.3307/unit.
In December 2023, the generation cost from nuclear sources increased by 9.03% to Rs1.316/unit compared to the previous month. Over the corresponding month of the previous year, the cost of generation from nuclear sources increased by 22.7%.
Although the generation from nuclear sources fell substantially by 36% to 1464 GWh in December 2023 compared to December 2022, it decreased by 6.9% compared to the previous month’s generation of 1,572 GWh.
Power generation figures reveal a 24.6% increase to 1,310 GWh from local coal and a 21% cut to 384 GWh from imported coal in December 2023 compared to the previous month.
Notably, in December 2023, the government produced less electricity from renewable and cost-effective sources compared to the same month last year. The underutilisation of these resources contributed to higher costs, impacting consumers with increased payments.

5,Bulls keep firm grip over robust exports,"KSE-100 index rises 609.18 points, settles at 63,002.92","Bulls remained in the driving seat at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday as the market added another nearly 610 points following robust export data that showed a surge of 26.9% year-on-year to $2.786 billion in January.
In the morning, trading kicked off on a volatile note in the wake of central bank’s announcement a day ago about a decrease of $54 million in its foreign exchange reserves that reached $8,216 million.
As urea sales went down 3% year-on-year and 2% month-on-month in January, market players moved cautiously. Consequently, the index hit its intra-day low at 62,448.72 in the first hour of trading.
However, a considerable drop in the Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) showing a decrease in food prices, stable rupee and hopes for political certainty after February 8 polls provided support to investor sentiment in the latter half of the day.
Positive contribution mainly came from sectors like automobile assemblers and commercial banks, which helped keep the market in the green and took it to the intra-day high at 63,075.30.
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 609.18 points, or 0.98%, and settled at 63,002.92.
Topline Securities, in its commentary, wrote that the KSE-100 index extended its previous day’s gains and largely traded in the positive zone to close at 63,003, up 0.98%.
Overall investor participation in the market continued to be at the lower end as they preferred to remain on sidelines before the upcoming general elections slated for February 8, it said.
Major positive contribution to the index came from Millat Tractors, Engro Fertilisers, Oil and Gas Development Company, MCB Bank and Lucky Cement, which cumulatively contributed 299 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, wrote that the market remained strong and regained 63k at the close of the week, limiting the week-on-week decline to 1.22%.
The advancers-to-decliners’ ratio stood at 63:20 where leading positive contributors were Millat Tractors (+5.63%), Engro Fertilisers (+3.07%), and Oil and Gas Development Co (+2.32%).

“The close above first resistance at 62.5k is constructive, which needs to be built as support next week to set up a move towards 64k,” AHL added.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal noted that the bourse witnessed a range-bound activity with the KSE-100 moving between the high and low of 63,075 and 62,449 points, respectively.
Traded volume stood at 264 million shares with K-Electric (+4.9%), Pakistan International Airlines (+8.6%), Pakistan Petroleum (-1.3%), Hascol Petroleum (+2.5%) and Oil and Gas Development Co (+2.3%) among the volume leaders, he said.
“Going forward, we expect range-bound activity to continue as election concerns remain. Investors are advised to avail of any downtrend as an opportunity to buy in exploration and production, cement and textile sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 263.5 million shares against Thursday’s tally of 270.5 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs10.7 billion.
Shares of 336 companies were traded. Of these, 217 stocks closed higher, 92 dropped and 27 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 26.6 million shares, gaining Rs0.22 to close at Rs4.68. It was followed by the Pakistan International Airlines with 25.8 million shares, gaining Rs0.87 to close at Rs10.94 and Pakistan Petroleum with 18.5 million shares, losing Rs1.46 to close at Rs114.34.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs181.6 million, according to the NCCPL.

6,"Rupee rises, but market gap widens",Currency remains on winning streak for 4th straight day,"Pakistani currency rose to over three-month high at slightly below Rs279.50 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market on Friday, maintaining its winning streak for the fourth consecutive working day in the wake of increase in supply of foreign currency.
In the open market, however, the currency continued its downturn for the second successive day as it stayed above Rs281 against the greenback.
Accordingly, the difference between currency values in the two markets kept on widening, which triggered some concern. Earlier, a significantly larger spread had made the currency volatile in September last year.

According to SBP data, the rupee ticked up 0.03%, or Rs0.07, on a day-on-day basis in the inter-bank market, and closed at Rs279.41/$.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported that the local currency dropped a fresh 0.04%, or Rs0.13, to close at Rs281.21 in retail trade.
The movement in the rupee value in opposite directions in the inter-bank and open markets caused the widening of difference to 0.64%, or Rs1.80.

8,Weekly inflation hits 11-week low,"Despite persistent elevation, this marks second consecutive week of downturn","The weekly inflation rate in Pakistan recorded a significant deceleration, reaching an 11-week low at 39.45% in the week ending February 1, 2024. This downturn, measured through the Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI), is attributed to a drop in food prices, counteracting the impact of increased petroleum product prices. Despite this decline, the inflation rate remains elevated, indicating ongoing economic challenges.
According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the inflation reading decreased by 0.28% in the reported week compared to the previous week. This marks the second consecutive week of downturn on a week-on-week basis. The inflation rate had sustained above 40% for the preceding 11 consecutive weeks, reaching an eight-month high at 44.60% in the week ending January 18, 2024.
During the week under review, out of 51 items, prices of 12 (23.53%) items increased, 17 (33.33%) items decreased, and 22 (43.14%) items remained unchanged. Notable reductions include an 18.28% decrease in tomato prices to Rs108.32/kg, a 7.77% drop in egg prices to Rs393.31/dozen, and a 6.99% decline in onion prices to Rs209.52/kg. Additionally, the price of an LPG gas (11.67 kg cylinder) dropped by 1.53% to Rs3,341.48/cylinder.
Prices of other commodities experienced cuts in the range of 0.28% to 1.29%, covering items such as Lipton tea, potatoes, pulse masoor, cooking oil, and mustard oil. However, the price of super petrol increased by 5.20% to Rs273.93/litre in the reported week compared to Rs260.39/litre in the previous week.
Read Caretakers also leave double-digit inflation
Prices of various other items increased by up to 1.88% on a week-on-week basis. These include chicken, diesel, energy saver, bananas, salt powdered, pulse moong, mutton, gur, beef, tea prepared, and georgette, according to the PBS.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) projects that the benchmark monthly inflation reading, measured through the Consumer Price Index (CPI), will experience a significant deceleration starting from March 2024 and onwards. However, the SBP revised its projection for the average monthly inflation reading for the full fiscal year 2024 to be in the range of 23-25%, up from the previous estimate of 20-22%.
The anticipated increase in the average inflation reading is based on the record multi-decade high readings observed in the first half of the fiscal year. The reading slightly decelerated to 28.3% in January 2024 from the three-month high of 29.7% recorded in December 2023. The SBP underscored that the non-energy inflation reading has remained consistent with its July 2023 projection, as the hike in petrol and gas prices necessitated a revision of the full-year forecast.

9,DISCOs contribute Rs396b to debt,Report highlights that decline in recovery of bills has exacerbated crisis,"The persistent inefficiencies in power distribution companies, coupled with governance issues, have been identified as the primary drivers behind a staggering addition of Rs396 billion to Pakistan’s circular debt during the financial year 2022-23. According to the Industry Report 2022-23 released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), substantial losses and a decline in the recovery of electricity bills have exacerbated the circular debt crisis.
Nepra has recommended a forensic audit to enforce accountability within the staff, fostering transparency and efficiency in the distribution network. The report highlights that most Distribution Companies (DISCOs) failed to meet Transmission and Distribution (T&D) loss targets, significantly burdening the circular debt.
Entities such as Peshawar Electric Supply Company (PESCO), Tribal Electric Supply Company (TESCO), and Sukkur Electric Power Company (SEPCO) have reported notable losses, contributing a substantial Rs160.49 billion to the circular debt. PESCO alone has added Rs77.35 billion to the debt, showcasing the severity of the issue.
In detail, PESCO contributed Rs77.3 billion, Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO) Rs21.9 billion, Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO) Rs7.9 billion, Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) Rs15 billion, SEPCO Rs20.38 billion, and Quetta Electric Supply Company (QESCO) Rs21.21 billion.
Circular Debt Reaches Alarming Levels
As of June 30, 2023, the circular debt has surged to a staggering Rs2.309 trillion from Rs2.252 trillion in FY2021-22, posing a significant challenge. The power regulator has underlined the need for the government to address this by ensuring timely subsidy payments and exploring innovative solutions to minimise losses.
The recovery rate in FY2022-23 stood at 92.4%, resulting in an additional Rs236 billion added to the circular debt. Nepra suggests that the government, as the owner of DISCOs, should consider outsourcing recovery tasks and focus on addressing inefficiencies to curb the accumulation of circular debt.
Mounting Receivables
Receivables for DISCOs rose to approximately Rs1,727,104 million in FY2022-23, prompting concerns about potential billing manipulation. Nepra recommends the establishment of committees with independent professionals to ensure accurate receivables, stressing the need for transparent billing and collection practices.
Read Minister defends DISCOs overbilling
Nepra strongly condemns load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses and urges DISCOs to focus on resolving inefficiencies rather than resorting to arbitrary reductions. A forensic audit is recommended to ensure accountability, transparency, and efficiency in the distribution network.
Impact on Grid Integration
DISCOs’ failure to provide new connections as per the Pakistan Standards for Distribution Rights 2005 has led to a substantial backlog of connections. Nepra stresses that accountability measures, including penalties for negligence and rewards for exemplary performance, are necessary to address this issue.
In FY2022-23, 163 fatalities were reported in DISCOs, prompting comprehensive investigations, fines, compensation to bereaved families, and directives for safety improvements. Nepra underscored the essential need for grounding poles/structures and a focus on safety to prevent accidents.
To address challenges in DISCOs, Nepra recommends involving the private sector. Governance issues and inefficiencies contribute to the circular debt, necessitating concerted efforts to improve DISCOs’ performance.
AMI Initiatives
The authority has sanctioned a five-year investment plan of Rs375 billion for Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), LESCO, and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO). Encouraging the installation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) was encouraged as it is considered crucial for real-time monitoring and efficiency improvement.
