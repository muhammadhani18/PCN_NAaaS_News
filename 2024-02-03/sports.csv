0,Child helpers continue to suffer violence,Poor implementation of bills against child trafficking has allowed perpetrators to escape strict penalties,"Despite the government introducing laws every now and then, aimed at the elimination of child abuse and forced labor from society, the lack of implementation of crucial bills like the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act, 2018 has prevented the imposition of strict penalties against those found guilty.
For instance, just a couple of months ago, Noor Sadia, a nine year old child maid was found in a tortured state by the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau Punjab from a house located in the People’s Colony area of Faisalabad, where her mother, Zahida Bibi had left her for work six months ago.
When a video recording an instance of violence against the child was sent to the Child Protection Bureau by an eyewitness, a case was registered against the accused which included specific sections of the Protection of Children Act, 2004 and the Pakistan Penal Code. However, Section 4 of the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act (TIP) 2018 was not included, even though the case involved child trafficking and forced child labor. This allowed the perpetrators to escape any serious charges.
“Section 4 of the TIP Act should have been considered while investigating the Noor Sadia case. Excluding the provisions of the act implies that the process of prosecution will be lenient and the accused will be benefited,” worried Syed Kausar Abbas, leader of the Sustainable Social Development Organization.
“Almost 50 per cent of the children who are rescued from abusive work environments, are trafficked from other cities or forced into labor by their families. Therefore, the TIP Act must be applied so that strict penalties are issued against perpetrators and child abuse cases can be controlled,” asserted Sarah Ahmed, Chairperson of the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau, who was of the opinion that there was a need to create awareness on the applications of the TIP clause to child abuse cases. 
According to data obtained by The Express Tribune from the Punjab Labour and Human Resources Department, 2,516 cases have so far been registered under the Child Abuse and Trafficking in Persons Act, 2018 from March 2022 to October 2023, with the highest number of 635 First Information Reports (FIR’s) registered during September 2023, when 318 children were rescued.
Speaking to Express Tribune, Sadia Sohail Rana, former Member of the Punjab Assembly said, “Trafficking is a global issue but the tragedy in our country is that even when the relevant laws exist, implementing them is a challenge. All political parties should make this matter a part of their manifestos, and whichever party forms the next government, it should ensure its implementation.”
