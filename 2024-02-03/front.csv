0,Will not rest until Pakistan becomes stable: Nawaz,"Former PM zeroes in on country’s youth, claims young people rallying behind PML-N","Former prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Quaid Nawaz Sharif on Saturday declared his unyielding commitment to stabilising Pakistan, vowing not to rest until the nation overcame economic challenges.
Zeroing in on the youth – a demographic often viewed as the PTI's voter base – Nawaz confidently claimed the young people of Pakistan were rallying behind the PML-N.
""We will not rest until Pakistan becomes stable. We will not rest until we don’t bring back the lights in homes, eradicate poverty and unemployment, and build schools, hospitals, and motorways. We will fulfil the promises made by my brother Shehbaz Sharif,” he said while addressing a rally in Gujranwala.

The former prime minister expressed his concerns regarding the negative narrative propagated on social media.
""Some individuals create a storm of negativity on social media, claiming that the youth is with them. However, the real youth of Pakistan is the one standing with us,” he added.
A rapturous welcome by Gujranwala!! This is called popularity among the people. Mian sb is the BOSS!!

On his previous term as the prime minister, Nawaz remarked: ""During my tenure, the prices of commodities such as motorcycles, tractors, gas, flour, petrol, sugar and other items were lower. Look at the prices now; injustice has been imposed on the people.""
A day earlier, the PML-N supremo had also addressed the young demographic while jibing the PTI, saying that the country’s “real youth” stands behind his party, besides the “mummy-daddy ones”.
“Some people say the youth supports someone else. But no, youth, not the mummy-daddy ones, are with the PML-N. The real Pakistani youth. That’s why Nawaz Sharif loves you,” the former prime minister told a rally in Faisalabad on Friday.

‘Viral disease eliminated permanently’
In an apparent reference to former prime minister Imran Khan, PML-N Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz, during her address, stated that a “viral disease” was causing significant harm to Pakistan but that had been eradicated now forever.
She said that the “viral disease” had plagued Pakistan for the past five to seven years, causing extensive damage, but it had now been eliminated permanently.

She mentioned that Gujranwala was the first to defeat this viral disease, saying that the ones who had initiated the long march had fled from Gujranwala.
Maryam highlighted that promises of five million houses were made, but not a single house was constructed.
""If Nawaz Sharif had promised five million houses, he would have definitely deliver,” she claimed.
She concluded by urging to end the politics of revenge and to embark on a journey of progress.

1,Bilawal accuses Nawaz of political machination in Sindh,Claims PML-N Quaid trying to make inroads into Sindh via 'puppet govt',"PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Saturday escalated his verbal onslaught against PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif, accusing him of attempting to make inroads into Sindh – his party's fortress – by establishing ""a puppet government"" in the province.
Bilawal alleged that the former premier’s grand plan extended beyond imposing himself on Pakistan, adding that he was scheming for a puppet government in Karachi, all set to pilfer the rights and resources.
“Nawaz is not only trying to impose himself on Pakistan, he also wants a puppet government sitting in Karachi, so that he can rob your rights and your resources,” Bilawal alleged while addressing a public meeting in Chachro, Tharparkar district.
He, later in the evening, also spoke at a large public meeting in Mirpurkhas district.
He warned Tharparkar’s people that the PML-N also wanted to exploit the resource-rich Karoonjhar mountain which they had been protecting for a long time.
“They think if their government is formed, they will exploit granite and mineral resources of Karoonjhar.”
He underscored that the mountain was an asset of Tharparkar and that only the district’s people had the right to benefit from it.
“If they move their hands towards Karoonjhar, we will cut off their hands.”

The local people last year launched a protest movement and also started legal battles after which the contracts for extracting granite and minerals from the mountain were cancelled by the Sindh government.
The PPP chairman charged the PML-N for allegedly conspiring to trigger hatred and division among the people in Mirpurkhas as well as for having prepared a rigging plan.
“They [PML-N] are telling their facilitators who do politics of hate and division and the politics of terror to rig the elections,” he said referring to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan.
Bilawal contended that the MQM-P could not accept the fact that the people of Karachi and Hyderabad had elected two jiyalas as mayors of their cities.
He argued that the party wanted to repeat the political violence, giving examples of two recent violent incidents in Karachi.
“I want to warn them that if my workers get hurt, I will hold them accountable for this with my own hands.”

The PPP chairman emphasised that the people of Sindh had put to rest the politics of ethnic division and animosity.
However, he pointed out that certain political vested interests were attempting to revive it.
He requested the party workers and supporters to remain at the polling stations until the presiding officers provided Form-45 for the PPP candidates.
Reflecting on a past error, he highlighted that they had announced a break, intending to resume counting the next day, which proved to be a mistake. ""But not this time,” he added.
He asked the supporters to sleep at the polling stations if they were not given the official results on the election day.
Bilawal reiterated that Nawaz wanted to rig the elections in other parts of the country like Multan and Khuzdar as well.
He reminded the political opponents that the PPP jiyalas should not be considered some ‘mummy-daddy’ type enthusiasts.
“They are the workers who fought against dictator Ziaul Haq in MRD (Movement for the Restoration of Democracy) and against Pervez Musharraf.”

The PPP leader said Nawaz was not a tiger but a cat who was mistaken to believe that he could rob his mandate.
“If the mandate is snatched from the people of Mirpurkhas, we will go together to the ECP and we will snatch the voting results.”
He also criticised the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) as another facilitator of the PML-N.
He said Nawaz was thrice elected as the PM but he could never serve the people of Sindh owing to which he was reluctant to field his party’s candidates in the province.
“Therefore, he is looking for the candidates of the star (GDA’s election symbol) who will serve Lahore and Raiwand if elected.”
He asked his supporters to defeat all candidates contesting with the star symbol in the province.
“I like stars in the sky at night but not during the day.”
On Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s independent candidates, he reiterated that the people ought to understand that the upcoming polls were a one-on-one combat between the PPP and the PML-N.

He said the votes cast in favour of the independent candidates would go to waste.
“If the people want to stop the tiger from becoming the PM for the fourth time, then there is only one way and it is to put a stamp on the arrow (PPP’s electoral symbol) on the election day. God willing, I will hunt that tiger with the arrow after winning the election.”
The PPP chairman announced that after winning the elections, his party’s government would connect Tharparkar to Karachi via railway link.
He recalled that his government first built roads followed by an airport in Islamkot, Tharparkar.
The new mode of communication between the desert region and the coastal metropolis would not only facilitate trade but also the movement of people, he believed.
Bilawal also challenged Nawaz’s claim of starting the Thar coal project, saying if he was really speaking the truth, then Nawaz would have been addressing the public meeting in Tharparkar instead of him.
In another popular promise to the electorate, he assured that he would “snatch” lands from the feudal lords if they were required to build houses for the flood-affected people of Sindh who would also be given ownership rights.
According to him, it would be easier for the government to build residential units and give ownership rights to women on the state-owned land.

2,Interim govt seals plan to privatise PIA,Fawad says cabinet to give final approval,"The caretaker government was making “binding plans” for the incoming government after the February 8 elections to privatise the loss-making Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Privatisation Minister Fawad Hasan Fawad said on Friday.
In the past, elected governments have shied away from undertaking unpopular reforms, including the sale of the national-flag carrier. However, in June, the then coalition government agreed to overhaul loss-making state-owned enterprises under a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The government, then led by Shehbaz Sharif, decided to privatise PIA just weeks after signing the IMF agreement. The caretaker government, which took office in August, was empowered by the outgoing parliament to take any steps needed to meet the budgetary targets agreed with the IMF.
“Our job is 98% done,” Fawad told Reuters when asked about the plan to sell the airline. “The remaining 2% is just to bring it on an excel sheet after the cabinet approves it,” he said, adding that the cabinet would also decide whether to sell the stake by tender or through a government-to-government deal.
Fawad said the plan, drawn up by transaction adviser Ernst & Young, would be presented to the cabinet for approval before the tenure of the administration ends following the election. “What we have done in just four months is what past governments have been trying to do for over a decade,” Fawad said.
“There is no looking back,” Fawad added. He did not give specific details of the size of the stake to be sold, but two sources said that a 51% stake with full management control would be offered to buyers after parking the airline’s debts in a separate entity, under the 1100-page report from Ernst & Young.
PIA had liabilities of Rs785 billion and accumulated losses of Rs713 billion as of June last year. Its chief executive officer (CEO) had said that the losses in 2023 were likely to be Rs112 billion. Fawad confirmed the PIA privatisation plan involved its debts being spun off into a separate entity.
Progress on the privatisation will be a key issue if the incoming government goes back to the IMF once the current bailout programme expires in March. Caretaker Finance Minister Shamshad Akhtar told reporters last year that Pakistan would have to remain in IMF programmes after its expiry.
Besides operational and technical measures for PIA’s divestment, the caretaker government has also amended a 2016 law that had blocked selling off its majority shares, according to a draft posted on the Pakistan parliament’s website.
Ishaq Dar, who was the finance minister when Shehbaz was the prime minister and has been named by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) to retain the portfolio if it forms the next government, told Reuters that the sale of PIA will be fast-tracked. “It will, God willing, move ahead with fast speed.”
In a report in mid-January, the IMF expressed satisfaction over the measures initiated by the caretaker government to accelerate reforms of state-owned enterprises, specifically mentioning the amendment of the PIA privatisation law.
Under the privatisation plan submitted by Ernst & Young to the government on December 27, government-guaranteed legacy debt and payables – which are held by a consortium of seven domestic banks – would be parked in a holding company, Fawad and two sources involved in the process said.
Fawad said the government and the consortium had an agreement in place regarding the settlement of the legacy debt, which includes negative equity of Rs825 billions in loans, creditors’ money and the losses. He provided no further details.
The sources had earlier said the banks wanted a five-year bond issued against the debt with a 16.5% coupon on the paper, while the finance ministry was offering only 10%. The banks have not commented on the deal.

Besides its losses, PIA’s safety standards have been questioned by global aviation authorities for some years. In early 2020, Czech and Hungarian air force jets were scrambled to intercept a PIA flight with 300 people on board as it went astray due to an “avoidable human error” by its pilot.
In May that year, the crash of a PIA plane in Karachi killed nearly 100 people and a fake pilot licence scandal erupted later in 2020. The scandal led to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) banning the airline from flying to its most lucrative routes in Europe and the UK.
The 2020 ban is still in place and has cost the airline nearly Rs40 billion in revenue annually, according to government records presented in parliament. Pakistan’s financial crisis has also led to seizure of PIA aircraft by creditors in recent months, according to the airline.
While the airline awaits the government’s decision on a sale, it continues to need financial support: 23.7 billion rupees are required to keep it afloat for another five to six months before control is given to a new buyer, three government and PIA sources said.
However, not everyone agrees with pressing ahead speedily with the sale. Three senior airline officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said a fast sale could devalue the airline’s worth, and that it would not be a transparent transaction without due diligence.
But Singapore-based aviation analyst Brendan Sobie said PIA is in dire straits: the plan submitted to the government was “essentially the only option to save” the airline. “The privatisation will be challenging and a sale is likely not possible unless it first undergoes a deep restructuring and the debts are cleared.”
PIA’s assets include key slots at the world’s busiest airports and air routes to top European destinations, the Middle East and North America. PIA has air service agreements with more than 150 countries and generates about Rs280 billion annually in revenues despite the EU ban, airline records show.
It has 10 slots at Heathrow, which, according to two PIA officials, are currently worth Rs70 billion annually. It has a further nine slots at Manchester and four at Birmingham. Turkish and Kuwaiti airlines have been operating 70% of the slots under a business arrangement with PIA, the PIA officials said.
Separately, PIA’s physical assets, which include aircraft, hotels in Paris and New York and other properties, are worth Rs105.6 billion as per book value, according to the airline’s annual report for 2023. PIA officials, however, said the market value of the assets could be above $1 billion. In any case, the hotels and other properties would not be up for sale, they said. Reuters

3,Will die instead of striking deal: Imran,PTI announces it will challenge Iddat case verdict in high court,"Following the verdict announced in the 'illegal' marriage case that sentenced him and his wife to seven years in jail, PTI founding chairman Imran Khan on Saturday insisted that he would die instead of striking a deal with the ‘powerful stakeholders’ whereas the party announced that the judgment would be challenged in the high court.
Speaking to reporters after the announcement of the verdict, the former premier maintained that the Iddat case was an attempt to humiliate him and his wife, Bushra Bibi.
He added that nobody had been convicted in a case related to Iddat in the country’s history.
Imran said it was also the first time that somebody was sentenced to 14 years in jail in a Toshakhana case.
The PTI founding chairman said around 200 cases had been registered against him, adding that nobody had been booked so many times before.
He continued that there were 400 drone attacks in the country but nobody raised their voice against them.
“Now that their slave has arrived, he will do their bidding,” Imran said, apparently referring to PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif.
Talking to the media outside the Adiala Jail, PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party would challenge the ‘Illegal’ marriage case verdict before the high court.
He added that an application to shift Bushra from Bani Gala residence to Adiala Jail would be submitted to the high court as well.
“If there are no holidays, we will submit the application today because Bushra Bibi did not go to the Bani Gala residence as part of some deal.”

Gohar claimed that the verdict was an attempt to subject Imran to character assassination, terming the ‘illegal’ marriage case “shameless and baseless”.
The PTI leader claimed that Imran was accused of “immorality” and sentenced to seven years in prison in a frivolous case.
He complained that the party was not even allowed the opportunity to present its evidence or show it during cross-examination.
Gohar said the decision was pronounced verbally and a copy of the written verdict was not provided to them.
“All this is happening for political motives” he added.
He pointed out that this was the first time in the county’s history that a political party’s internal polls had been challenged and it was deprived of its electoral symbol.
He hoped that the high court would deliver justice to Imran.
Speaking to reporters after the verdict, Bushra said it was a war of “honour” and “disgrace”, adding that the decision had to be made by the people.
She added that the matter of Iddat was clear in the Holy Quran. “My Lord has already told me about Iddat in the Holy Quran.”
She maintained that the verdict in the case was that of the Satan.

4,SIFC pushes for IMF nod on Rs1.27t energy debt,Energy ministry proposed settling the debt without increasing tariff and without having any impact on budget,"The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) on Friday directed the authorities concerned to urgently secure the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) approval for the clearance of Rs1.27 trillion energy sector unpaid debt aimed at avoiding any further increase in electricity and gas tariffs to retire the debt.
If the cost of circular debt is passed on to the consumers, the electricity tariff will go up by Rs24 per unit, hitting Rs66 per unit. Similarly, gas tariff may also go up by Rs5,800 per metric million British thermal unit (mmbtu) for all consumers, which is more than double the existing rates.
The energy ministry has proposed settling the debt without increasing the tariff and without having any impact on the budget.
The instructions to immediately secure the approval of the IMF were given to the finance and energy ministries during the 9th meeting of the SIFC, which was also the last meeting of the civil-military body before the general elections.
The finance ministry has already shared the plan with the IMF and now it needs to pursue the lender to give its stamp of approval soon.
The total energy sector circular debt stands at Rs5.725 trillion as of Nov 2023. This includes Rs2.7 trillion power sector debt and over Rs3 trillion gas sector debt. The energy ministry has proposed to retire Rs1.268 trillion out of this, or 22% of the stock.
The SIFC was apprised that the proposed Rs1.27 trillion circular debt retirement plan had neither any financial impact on the budget nor would it burden the consumers of gas and electricity in the shape of higher prices to recover the debt.
In the past, the power sector circular debt was either settled through budget or the consumers were forced to pay for the cost of inefficiencies of the energy sector. The electricity consumers are still paying Rs3.23 per unit to pay interest on the power sector circular debt –a situation that may also arise in the gas sector if the issue was not taken head on, according to a cabinet member.
A senior government functionary said that considering the existing inflationary pressures, the circular debt could no more be passed on to the consumers in the shape of price increase.
The IMF has in the past been criticised for making the electricity prices unaffordable for the majority of the consumers under its failed strategy to retire the debt through price increase. If this debt is not cleaned now, it may become a major stumbling block at the time of the next programme talks.
The petroleum sector circular debt is a new phenomenon, which has now become an impediment to Pakistan after rapid depletion of indigenous resources by 7% annually. The debt and inadequate revenue requirement determination and subsidised gas prices has now put the entire petroleum sector at stake after the power sector.
Compared to only 17% increase in the power sector circular debt, the gas sector’s unpaid debt has doubled to over Rs3 trillion in less than three and half years, becoming yet another new threat to economic stability of Pakistan.
In June 2020, the gas sector debt was Rs1.5 trillion, which by November 2023 increased by another Rs1.5 trillion.
The Rs5.7 trillion energy sector circular debt includes Rs1.2 trillion late payment surcharges, mainly in the gas sector. Out of the Rs3 trillion gas sector debt, 70% is owed to exploration and production firms.

The details showed one-third of the gas sector debt, or Rs1.1 trillion is only owed to the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL), followed by Rs788 billion to the Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Rs793 billion to the Pakistan State Oil (PSO). The plan proposes settlement of debt of only the public sector firms.
Many companies in the exploration and production sectors are not recording the late payment surcharges as receivables to avoid tax exposures.
The energy ministry is seeking Rs745 billion supplementary grant for only two days, which under the plan would go back to the coffers of the Q Block in the shape of dividend payments against the government’s shares in these companies.
The net impact on budget of the Rs1.27 trillion circular debt plan will come to Rs902 billion. Out of the Rs902 billion, the lion’s share of Rs556 billion, or 62%, will go to one firm – the OGDCL.
Of the debt settlement plan of Rs1.27 trillion, it is proposed to retire a little over Rs1 trillion of the gas sector circular debt, involving companies listed at the stock market and leaving a major impact on their share prices. The remaining over Rs255 billion will be spent on curtailing the power sector circular debt of Rs2.7 trillion.
The IMF’s endorsement and implementation of the plan is very critical before the caretaker government hands over control to the next elected government. There is no guarantee that the next elected government would implement the plan. Such attempts have twice been made in the past but each time the finance ministry scuttled it.
Energy ministry officials said that the grant of Rs745 billion was needed for only two days to trigger the entire process. The actual funds that would go back to the kitty in the shape of dividends and taxes would be Rs748 billion, they claimed in the plan submitted to the SIFC.
Once implemented, the gas sector debt will come down from over Rs3 trillion to Rs2 trillion. The power sector circular debt will drop to Rs2.5 trillion.
The energy ministryhas proposed a seven-tier plan to settle the circular debt in a manner that greases the system but has no impact on the budget.
An amount of Rs556 billion will go to OGDCL. The second highest amount will be given to the Government Holdings Private Limited (GHPL), which will receive Rs168 billion, followed by Rs146 billion for the National Power Parks Management Company (NPPMC) and Rs29 billion for the PSO. The Pakistan Development Fund Limited (PDFL) will get Rs82.7 billion.
As per the plan, the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) will disburse Rs386 billion to exploration and production (E&P) companies. An amount of Rs126 billion will go to the PPL, Rs10 billion to the GHPL and Rs250 billion to the OGDCL on account of the SNGPL’s payables.
The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) will disburse Rs259 billion to E&P companies and out of which Rs112 billion will go to the GHPL and Rs147 billion to the OGDCL. The OGDCL’s private shareholders will receive Rs59.5 billion and the PPL’s private shareholders will get Rs23.8 billion.
The Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) will get Rs146 billion, including Rs100 billion of the supplementary grant.
The government fully owns the NPPMC and the GHPL. But its shareholding in the PPL was 75%, besides 85% in the OGDCL and 25% in the PSO. The OGDCL is expected to announce Rs467 billion in dividends, of which Rs397 billion will be the government’s share.
Without settlement of the past debt, the finance ministry would not be able to receive its future dividends, therefore, it is the time that the ministry and the IMF should act to clear the mess and save the consumers from further price hike, according to the energy ministry officials.
The PPL is projected to give Rs126 billion in dividends and Rs98 billion is expected to land in the government’s coffers. The GHPL will give Rs168 billion in dividends, the NPPMC Rs40 billion and the PDFL Rs28.7 billion. The PSO has been kept out of the dividend cycle.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) will get Rs24.2 billion in the shape of income tax on dividend payments.

5,Verdicts rained down on Imran at lightning speed,"PTI founding chairman, wife get seven years in jail in ‘illegal’ marriage case in third judgment in a week","A court on Saturday sentenced former premier Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to seven years imprisonment in an “un-Islamic” marriage case – meaning it found that they had tied the knot while the former first lady was going through her period of Iddat.
Senior civil judge Qudratullah, while announcing a reserved verdict, also imposed a Rs500,000 fine each on the PTI founding chairman and his wife.
The written order read that the two would be imprisoned for a further four months if they failed to pay the fines.
This was the third conviction handed down to the deposed premier over the last five days.
Earlier this week, the PTI founding chairman and his wife were sentenced to 14-year imprisonment in the Toshakhana (gift repository) case.
Similarly, Imran and PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi were handed down a jail term of 10 years in the cipher case this week as well.
The hearing of the “illegal” marriage case, which was filed by Bushra’s first husband, Khawar Maneka, was conducted within the premises of Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail.
Maneka alleged that Bushra had violated the Islamic practice of observing the mandatory pause, or Iddat, before marrying Imran.
Iddat is a mandatory waiting period that a Muslim woman must observe on account of the death of her husband or dissolution of the marriage.
Further, Maneka accused his ex-wife and Imran of having an adulterous relationship before their marriage.
The order read that Imran and Bushra were found guilty under Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) Section 496 (marriage ceremony fraudulently gone through without lawful marriage).
Earlier during the hearing, Maneka’s lawyer Rizwan Abbasi said in his final arguments that Bushra was divorced on Nov 14, 2017.
He continued that despite the long cross-examination of the witnesses, the accused could not deny the allegations and that was why the first marriage of Bushra and Imran took place on Jan 1, 2018.
Abbasi pointed out that after the completion if the Iddat period in Feb 2018, the oral marriage took place again.
He maintained that his client Maneka had been defrauded and deprived of his right to Rujuh (resumption of conjugal relationship) because of his former wife’s re-marriage.

Imran’s lawyer Salman Akram Raja said in his final arguments that the divorce took place in April 2017 and there was evidence of it.
He added that they wanted to present the third party witness in the case.
He contended that there had been no fraud as the Supreme Court had decided that the minimum duration of Iddat could be 39 days.
He added that from Nov 14, 2023 to Jan 1, 2024, the period came to 48 days.
The lawyer pointed out that Maneka had suddenly filed his complaint five years and 11 months after his ex-wife’s re-marriage.
He noted that Bushra in her statement to the court had said that her ex-husband divorced her orally in April 2017 and the document that he had presented in Nov 2017 was forged.
The lawyer further pointed out that Bushra in her statement observed that Maneka had remained in custody till Nov 14, 2023, after which he filed the complaint.
The court then announced its verdict.
According to the country’s superior judiciary, the union of husband and wife without observing the period of Iddat was an irregular marriage that might have consequences under Islamic law but it could not be declared as void.
Maneka filed the complaint under sections 34 (common intention), 496, and 496-B (fornication) of the PPC.
Last month, the civil judge, Qudratullah, indicted the couple in the illegal marriage case.
Later in January, the IHC stopped the proceedings against the couple and restrained the prosecution from producing the evidence in the case.
However on Jan 31, the IHC observed that it could not intervene in the trial process once the suspects had been indicted. However, it dropped the charge of Section 496-B from the case as it was not framed by the trial court.

6,Social media: a tool of choice for the campaigning,Political parties can no longer afford to shun digital age,"In this era of the internet, politics and social media are intertwined and inseparable. Reason: political powwow happens on social media platforms like TikTok, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and X – formerly Twitter – among others.
In the past, political parties and candidates used to rely more on posters, banners, door-to-door campaigns, corner meetings and rallies. However, in the internet-driven polls and amid security challenges coupled with sky-rocketing inflation, they are relying more on digital election campaigns, knowing that ignoring the social media platforms means they do not exist for voters, to say the least.
Experts believe political parties have shifted to digital playgrounds as they enable them to not only hear the public pulse but allow them to stay in touch with them. However, they added, it would be too early to entirely rule out the old-school methods such as food and transport, among other things, to persuade voters to come to polling stations.
“Information via social media platforms influences voters, especially, the young voters in urban and semi urban areas,” Raza Ahmad Rumi, a policy analyst and journalist, said.
“However,” he added, “there are many limitations when it comes to electoral politics.” First, Rumi maintained, elections in Pakistan, rural areas in particular, entail the influence of clan, tribe or familial ties and many voters use their right within the context of social networks they are part of.
Second, he incorporated, even if digital campaigns influence a voter in one particular direction, it is not certain that they would actually go out and vote. “The real challenge for parties and candidates ultimately is to mobilize the voter and bring them to polling stations,” Rumi said, saying, “This entails old-school methods of incentives such as transport, food and, in some cases, some measure of patronage.”
Rumi said that the digital campaigns are now a reality worldwide and Pakistan is no exception given the high penetration of mobile telephones in our society, saying the country has seen the effects of digital communications over the past decade.
The analyst said that the political parties, especially the PTI, are making full use of the social media platforms to influence voters and create an impression of their victory. “For the PTI,” Rumi said, “this is even more important given the legal and administrative crackdown on the party in recent months.”

Renowned political expert Majid Nizami said that the digital election campaigns are definitely effective but they haven’t fully captured the market yet. Digital election campaigns started in 2018 but the usage and reliance of digital media has increased to manifold in 2024 elections, Nizami said, adding that the trend of physical or on-ground campaign has decreased. He listed two main reasons for that: the current restive political situation; and political parties’ decision to shift to digital election campaigns.
WhatsApp, Facebook, X (Twitter), YouTube and other social media platforms are playing a crucial role in making up peoples’ mind, Nizami said, saying PTI was effectively utilising all social media platforms. He added that social media platforms were helping PTI to stay connected with its voters and supporters. Conversely, he added, the voters also remain aware of the happenings and able to comment on the developments.
“I think, all these apps will play an important role in the digital election campaign till the Election Day,” Nizami said.
Perhaps, he incorporated, it is being said that internet would be shut down to counter this important role during election days. The reason behind such theories is that a massive change has been witnessed because of these social media platforms and because of the change, people have shifted to alternate media.
To a question if digital voting campaigns can really change a voter’s mind, Nizami was of the view that digital election campaigns wouldn’t be able to change majority’s mind right now but its impact has already started. “In 2029, we may see that these digital election campaigns have a huge impact on elections,” Nizami said, saying it’s at an early phase right now but can slowly and gradually increase over the years.
Nizami said that the biggest question which remains to be answered is that if the digital campaigns would help bring the voters to polling stations as there is no example available in this regard. “We are going to experience it for the first time,” he said, adding that is why the political commentators are conjecturing that this is the potential point that can go in PTI’s favour as it is happening for the first time.
