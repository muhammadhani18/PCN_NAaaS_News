0,Trunk sewer project makes headway,RDA engages state-owned enterprise for feasibility study,"The Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) has engaged the National Engineering Services Pakistan (NesPak) to conduct a feasibility study for laying trunk sewers on both sides of Nullah Leh to transport the sewage from the city and Cantt areas to the Soan River.
The decision has been taken under the Government-to-Government principle to address the long-standing problem of environmental pollution and flooding in Rawalpindi.
RDA has contacted the Planning and Development Department (PND) for final approval.
This initiative aims to transport sewage from the city and Cantt areas to the Soan River, contributing to a cleaner environment and reducing the risk of flooding.
The project, which is part of a larger effort to tackle environmental challenges, is being approached in phases for effective implementation.
In the first phase, a comprehensive feasibility study will be conducted using funds of Rs48 million approved by the Punjab government. NesPak, a multinational state-owned enterprise, will be appointed as the consultant directly for this study, bypassing the traditional bidding process for contractors. This streamlined approach is expected to save time and ensure the services of a reputable agency.
The second phase of the project involves paving Leh’s middle section to channel rainwater effectively. In the third phase, roads will be constructed on both sides of the nullah, enhancing connectivity and providing an alternative traffic route to Islamabad. This strategic planning aims to alleviate the long-standing traffic congestion issues in Rawalpindi.
The RDA has been entrusted with the role of the executing agency for the Leh project. A PC-2 of Rs48 million has been approved for the initial phase, which will be included in the Annual Development Program (ADP) of the next financial year. The consultant will be responsible for preparing PC-1, and the formal contract award for the first phase will follow the completion of the feasibility study.
The project's significance is underscored by the ongoing challenges posed by the nullah’s open sewage, which has historically led to the loss of life and property during monsoon floods.
According to an RDA official, the decision to address this issue in various phases reflects a pragmatic approach to managing the project's costs while ensuring its timely completion.
The urgency of this initiative was highlighted in the aftermath of the devastating floods in 2001/2, which caused substantial financial losses and loss of lives in Rawalpindi. Previous efforts to address the Nullah Leh problem, including a project started in 2006/7, faced challenges and eventual termination in 2008. However, the current phased approach demonstrates a renewed commitment to solving this critical environmental and infrastructural issue in Rawalpindi, the official added.

1,Bandits kill accomplice during shop robbery,"In another incident, a citizen was injured for offering resistance to the snatchers","Robbers mistakenly killed their accomplice during a shop robbery and injured another citizen over resistance during a street crime incident on Sunday.
The CCTV footage showed that two robbers entered a grocery store in Afshan Colony in Racecourse police limits, held the owner hostage at gunpoint and started looting cash and valuables.
In the CCTV footage, the shopkeeper could be seen busy dealing with routine business affairs, while two bandits with masks on their faces could be seen entering the shop and inspecting it. One of the suspects wearing jeans and a brown jacket could be seen pulling out a pistol and demanding cash while pointing the gun at the shopkeeper. His other accomplice wearing shalwar kameez is looking busy on the other side of the shop.
The footage further shows that the shopkeeper, in an apparent act of diverting the attention of the suspects, throws his wallet towards the door. When the robber goes to pick up the wallet, the shopkeeper grabs the opportunity to take out his pistol. In the meantime, the robber could be seen pulling cash from the wallet and returning it to the showcase.
As the robbers were about to leave the shop after collecting cash and a cell phone, the shopkeeper could be seen in the footage coming out under the showcase and firing at the suspects while chasing them.
Present outside the shop, some accomplices of the two robbers started firing indiscriminately. The shopkeeper could then be seen running back inside the shop. The CCTV footage further reveals that in the random shooting by robbers, one of the bullets hit their own accomplice in the head. The suspect died on the spot, while his accomplices managed to escape.
After being alerted, the local police reached the spot, gathered circumstantial evidence and recorded witnesses’ statements. The shopkeeper’s mobile phone, identification card and a pistol were also seized from the deceased’s possession.
Racecourse SHO Raja Iftikhar said that police teams have been formed to track down and arrest the runaway suspects.
In another incident, some robbers intercepted one Asif on Misrial Road and attempted to snatch cash and a cell phone. As the 34-year-old offered resistance, the suspects fired at him and fled. Witnesses alerted the Rescue 1122 service and police. The victim was shifted to a hospital. The police collected the evidence and began an investigation.

2,‘Mega projects to end Rawalpindi’s water woes’,WASA MD says rain harvesting system being installed in city’s 30 buildings to secure rainwater,"Rawalpindi Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) Managing Director Muhammad Saleem Ashraf Sunday said mega projects were under way to tackle the city’s water supply problems.
To save and prevent wastage of water, the agency was taking measures day and night to eliminate the leakages of underground water pipes, which would not only save water but help control dengue, he said in a press statement.
Wasa would make efforts to repair and renovate mini-filtration plants across the city, Saleem said, adding chlorine would be added to improve water quality and filters would be replaced at water filtration plants.
The MD further said that WASA Rawalpindi was trying to provide clean drinking water to the citizens, urging the citizens to cooperate with Wasa and pay their water and sewerage bills on time.
Work had been started on mega projects including the supply of 12 million gallons of water per day from Chahan Dam, additional five million gallons of water per day from Rawal Dam and the uninterrupted supply of water to six union councils (UCs) of Khayaban Sir Syed, he said.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was providing funds for these projects, he said and informed that along with this, the rain harvesting system was being installed at 30 different buildings of the city with the support of UN-HABITAT to secure the rainwater. Under the project, the rainwater would be collected from the roofs in the underground tanks and this water would be used for horticulture. The step would help save clean drinking water, he added.
He asked the officials to further improve the service delivery to enable uninterrupted water supply to the citizens, particularly during Ramazan.
The MD said that the supply of clean drinking water to the citizens was being ensured from the mini-filtration plants during Sehar and Iftar in Ramadan.
Solid steps were being taken for immediate repair in case of malfunction of tube wells, he said adding, that negligence on the part of the officials concerned would not be tolerated.
According to a Wasa spokesperson, the agency is working to augment new water sources to overcome the upcoming shortage of water, especially in the Potohar region.
