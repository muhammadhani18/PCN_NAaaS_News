1,Ex-officials asked to return vehicles,Chanzeb gave a deadline of April 1 for the return of vehicles and equipment,"Advisor to Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Tourism Zahid Chanzeb has expressed his displeasure and anger over the failure of secretaries and other officials to return the official vehicles and other equipment owned by the Department of Tourism, Culture and Archeology despite strict instructions in this regard and ordered the return of all these things till April 1.
The advisor on Friday summoned the competent authorities and inquired about it. He regretted to know that instead of implementing the written instructions of the department regarding the return of vehicles, laptops and other equipment, the concerned authorities kept lull on the letter.
On this, Zahid Chanzeb gave a deadline of April 1 for the return of vehicles and equipment and directed that if no positive response is received, all those who took the vehicles, laptops and other equipment of this department with them to their homes or other offices, their names might be made public and publish their list in print, electronic and social media as well as disciplinary action be taken against them simultaneously.
The Adviser clarified that for the stability of any institution or department, it is essential to maintain perfect level of discipline and transparency there, but when its assets are scattered, it is not able to ensure the duty of public service delivery.
It may be noted that the advisor soon after assuming his portfolio, had directed the former secretaries, heads of authorities and project directors to return all the privileges received by them after transfer and clarified that the vehicles, staff and equipment held by the officials previously of the department should be recalled immediately as only those officials who are serving here have the right to use the resources of the department.

2,Polio vaccination drive faces resistance in parts of Bannu,"In Ghura Bakhail, around 30% of children still need to be vaccinated","In Ghura Bakhail, Bannu district, where three polio cases were detected recently, around 30 per cent of children still need to be vaccinated.
This was revealed at a meeting titled ‘Reaching the Unreached’ held under the chairmanship of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Minister Qasim Ali Shah and under the auspices of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) and the Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI).

Attending the meeting were Special Secretary, Health for Polio Eradication Abdul Basit, Health Services Director General Dr Shaukat Ali, Provincial Emergency Operations Centre Director General Zeeshan, and personnel from all district Emergency Operation Centres who participated online.
Minister Qasim Shah highlighted the significant responsibility that fell on parents of unvaccinated children whose unwillingness, he said, to allow vaccination of their children was a consequence of insufficient awareness and posed a risk to the entire nation. He stated that it was imperative to avoid international sanctions due to such negligence.
The federal government will be engaged in discussions regarding these issues, he observed. Qasim Shah added that access to remote areas in southern districts was crucial and necessitated the resolution of every possible challenge.
The health minister emphasized that the ongoing drive was the third phase of a special campaign to ensure the vaccination of unvaccinated children. He was informed that, in 69 Union Councils in the province, children under five received 12 vaccines, including the oral polio vaccine, to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases. He was also told that the situation in Ghura Bakhail presented a challenge that was being addressed under these campaigns.

3,QMC finalise plans for olive plantation in Quetta,QMC finalise plans for olive plantation in Quetta,"Quetta Metropolitan Corporation (QMC) has decided to plant olive trees on public-private partnership basis to reduce pollution, address environmental issues and boost the green cover in the provincial capital.
Talking to APP, Quetta administrator, Muhammad Hamza Shafqaat said that state land would be allocated on lease to private firms for olive trees plantation at various sites specified in Quetta.
According to the plan, resource management tasks such as silviculture, inventories, planning, reforestation, monitoring and harvesting of crops would be carried out by the private sector.
Shafqaat said the tree plantation would generate direct and indirect socioeconomic, ecological and environmental benefits for the local people. The initiative would also help keep the land free from illegal encroachments and constructions, and to make the environment more beautiful and attractive.
The Quetta administration also plans to establish ‘Miyawaki forest’ at different places of the city to reduce city’s increasing temperature. Shafqaat said the aggressive plantation would help in controlling the growing environmental pollution and be useful for boosting oxygen levels in the atmosphere.
The Quetta administrator was of the view that the civic authority would enhance forestation through such unique techniques. He said available resources would be utilised to protect the natural resources which were necessary for preserving green environment. Shaqaat emphasised the need for formation of Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) in the province to add greenery and preserve provincial horticulture.
He observed that more efforts were needed to maintain and renovate the public parks along modern lines in a bid to provide recreational opportunity to the city’s residents.
