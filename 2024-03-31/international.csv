0,"'Stop genocide in Gaza,' demand Karachiites at solidarity night","Large number of people, belonging to all walks of life assembled at Shahrae-Quaideen after Taraveeh prayers","Tens of thousands of Karachiites converged at Shahrae Quaideen to join the Gaza Solidarity Night -- organised by Jamaat-e-Islami Karachi ­ to show their support for Palestinians against Israeli hostilities and crimes against humanity.
A large number of residents of the port city, belonging to all walks of life assembled at Shahrae-Quaideen after Taraveeh prayers. Women and children also participated in the event.
The participants, carrying placards and banners, chanted slogans against the Zionist regime and its supporters in the Muslim World, including Pakistan.
JI Karachi Ameer Engr Hafiz Naeemur Rehman delivered the presidential address, whereas Hamas leader Khalid Qadomi also addressed the participants. Among others, JI leader Osama Razai and MPA Farooq Farhan also delivered speeches.
Naeemur Rehman paid a rich tribute to the participants and shed light on the glorious significance of the event. ""We are ashamed as a nation that despite having all resources and missiles and nukes, we as a whole are unable to get the genocide in Gaza to an end,"" he said.
""We are united with Palestinians on the basis of Islam, no one can undo this relationship,"" he added.
He demanded the government to bring the injured Palestinians to Karachi so as the JI would arrange health facilities for them.
Israel has killed over 32,000 innocent Palestinians, he said, adding that not even a single child would die, had the Muslim World shown an iota of self-esteem.
On the occasion, he made it clear that the nation will not accept the supremacy of the United States, Israel and India. Those who are misleading the nation in this regard should put their house in order, he said.
Hamas Leader Dr Khalid Qadomi also addressed the event through a video link. He thanked Karachiites and Naeemur Rehman for their support.
He made it clear that the resistance fighters were not fighting for just a piece of land but for Qibla e Awal and the future of the entire Muslim World as Israel is the enemy of the entire Muslim block of the world.
Over a million Palestinians are displaced and have been forced to starve, he said, adding that Gaza is the responsibility of the Muslim World.
MPA Farooq Farhan said in his speech that the solidarity night has proved that Karachi supports Palestinians and the concept of Umma.
During the past 170 days, Gaza was showered with explosives, and on average, eight innocent people were killed per hour.
He said that the two-state solution theory has breathed its last under the debris of Gaza.
He said that the missile and nuclear programs of Pakistan were supposed to safeguard the nation and the Umma. He further said that no compromise would be made on the two programs.

1,Massive corruption scam unveiled in Sindh Food Dept,Corrupt officials stole wheat worth a whopping Rs3 billion from govt warehouses,"Shocking revelations have emerged regarding rampant corruption within the Sindh Food Department, implicating officials in a scam involving the misappropriation of wheat stocks. An investigation report has exposed the discrepancy in records of spoiled wheat, exposing a staggering loss of Rs3.22 billion to the national exchequer.
The inquiry has disclosed that unscrupulous employees of the Sindh Food Department orchestrated the theft of 379,062 sacks of wheat from various warehouses in the province over the past years, valued at a whopping  Rs3 billion. Using the pretext of the 2022 rains, these officials allegedly resorted to deceitful tactics, including the falsification of records to cover up their illicit activities.
According to the report, officials directly involved in the theft and smuggling of wheat attempted to camouflage the stolen stocks by adulterating damaged wheat with soil and stones. The connivance of district officers further exacerbated the situation, as they failed to account for the missing sacks that had been surreptitiously sold in the market.
On the orders of the caretaker chief minister, the newly appointed chairman sanctioned the submission of the comprehensive investigation report to Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, spearheaded by inspection team member Ali Gul Sanjrani.
The report implicates officials in the brazen theft of 379,000 sacks of wheat, with significant shortages reported in various regions, including Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, and Shaheed Benazirabad.
Moreover, it has been revealed that 200,000 sacks of wheat went missing from warehouses in Karachi alone. The investigation highlighted the cunning ploy employed by Food Department officials to disguise the stolen wheat by mixing it with substandard grains and debris, effectively inflating the recorded quantities.
The investigating officials underscored the alarming revelation that the stocked wheat, purportedly stored for two years, had actually been pilfered and sold in the market, with bags containing damaged wheat and foreign contaminants. Officials deliberately concealed the extent of the wheat's degradation from the investigation team.
The report unequivocally recommends stringent measures to recover the billions of rupees lost due to the wheat fraud, urging decisive action against the culpable officials. Moreover, in light of the compromised quality rendering the wheat unfit for consumption by both humans and animals, immediate steps are urged for its disposal to avert potential health hazards.
Surprisingly, Sindh Minister Jam Khan Shoro expressed unawareness of the scam, promising to provide a statement after obtaining relevant information.
The newly appointed chairman, Shakeel Ahmed Magnijo, has greenlit the submission of the investigation report to Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah.

2,Intermediate students flunk language subjects,"Dying culture of reading, poor pedagogical practices have spiked the rate of failure in English and Urdu exams","In order for a student to excel in any academic subject or profession, a foundational level of written and verbal proficiency in the primary language of instruction is a key requirement yet for thousands of intermediate students in the port city who are consistently failing their English and Urdu examinations, the chances of succeeding in their chosen career paths appear quite bleak.
Over the past few decades, the technological revolution and social media boom has instigated the downfall of the book reading culture, with children of all ages spending a great deal of their leisure time scrolling mindless reels on their gadgets as opposed to flipping the weighty pages of a novel. Where the unpopularity of reading among the youth of the country had already stalled their linguistic development to a great degree, teachers' adoption of poor pedagogical methods alongside students' excessive reliance on coached learning has laid the final brick in the wall of their failure in language subjects.
""These days the practice of reading as a hobby has died out since textbooks are the only books children are willing to even open. Most children spend all their free time scrolling on their phones. This constant usage of text and slang language has left them incapable of properly reading and writing English and Urdu,"" said Nuzhat Fatima, the mother of a student at the Government College North Nazimabad.
Raees, an intermediate student who failed both his Urdu and English exams during the recent session shared his preparation method. ""Instead of studying from my textbook, I had relied entirely on the notes that I had received from my coaching center,"" said Raees.
""Coaching centers have made a specific pattern of notes for Urdu and English. Since the student is prepared according to the fixed pattern, if the examination contains questions which are somewhat unique, the students start panicking. Furthermore, half the exam papers are sent to the homes of teachers, who are not qualified enough,"" claimed Irfan Shah, Professor of Urdu at the Sirajud Daula Government Boys College.
According to data obtained by the Express Tribune from the Board of Intermediate Education Karachi (BIEK) out of a total of 106,039 candidates from the faculties of Pre-Engineering, Pre-Medical, Science General, Commerce Regular and Commerce Private, 31 percent have failed in the subject of Urdu while 34 percent of the students have failed in English during the recent exam session in 2023.
Moreover, in 2023 the number of students failing the Urdu and English exam was 61 and 51 per cent higher respectively than that in 2022; in other words 33,000 children failed the Urdu exam and 36,000 failed the English exam in 2023 for all faculties of first year intermediate. Students of Commerce Regular fared the worst in the 2023 exams, with 44 per cent test takers failing in Urdu and 50 per cent failing in English.
Dr Sarosh Lodhi, convener of the fact-finding committee and Vice-Chancellor of NED University, uncovered the reasons behind the poor results in the intermediate board exams. ""Most of the teachers are not interested in teaching and are also not competent enough. Moreover, no monitoring system is in place in our colleges to supervise teaching. We have come to know that even at the university level, students are facing difficulty communicating in English and Urdu. We are in the center of an educational crisis and strict action is needed across all educational institutions,"" said Dr Lodhi.
""We have re-examined the Commerce Regular results as well. If a student has left the exam sheet blank, it means that they have not prepared properly. If students are not taking language subjects seriously then teachers are responsible to some extent. Students' interest in a subject is interrelated with the teachers' style of instruction,"" affirmed BIEK Chairman Professor Naseem Memon.

3,Turtle hatchlings make perilous journey from sandy nest to sea,"SWD Marine Turtle Unit helps almost 15,000 baby turtles reach water","Green marine turtles’ breeding season came to end at the Hawke's Bay with the advent of early summer in the city on the shore of the Arabian Sea.
However, the Sindh Wildlife Department Marine Turtle Conservation Unit helped 14,960 hatchlings embark on a new journey of life. At least 16 female turtles visiting the coastal areas of Karachi were also tagged.
After hatching, the baby turtles that survive the perilous journey to reach the ocean are called ""Great Survivors"", said SWD Chief Conservator Javed Mehr talking to The Express Tribune. The breeding season of marine turtles on the coast of Hawke's Bay is from September to February every year, he said.

According to Mehr, a total number of turtles visiting the shores of Hawke's Bay in 2023-24 was 530. Among them, 270 green turtles went back to the sea, while 260 females stayed to choose a place, dig a hole and lay eggs.
Similarly, SWD Marine Turtle Conservation Unit took measures to protect 260 nests and keep them safe from wild animals. At least 14,960 turtle hatchlings that came out from these eggs were kept in protective care were helped to safely embark on the journey of a new life to the sea.

According to Mehr, 16 female turtles visiting the beaches of Karachi were also tagged. It should be noted that due to hard work and efforts of staff at Sindh Wildlife Marine Turtle Conservation Unit millions of hatchlings have been sent on their long journey to the sea since 1970.

Female green turtles migrate from deep sea to shores of Hawke's Bay and Sandspit to lay their eggs, digging trenches in the soft sand and leaving. The day the babies hatch, mother is not there to protect them. As soon as they hatch from the eggs, baby turtles head to the sea and it is beginning of the perilous journey.
Predators, including stray dogs and birds devour many hatchlings before they reach the water, and after hitting the water, marine life too finds the hatchlings a tasty diet, Javed Mehr said adding a minor percentage of the hatchlings survives to grow up and are thus called ""Great Survivors"".
Turtles have an important part in the ecosystem, Mehr said, adding, these useful companions of man have been unable to defend their breeding sites on the shores of Hawke's Bay and Sands Pit for centuries. It is feared that future generations may read about these turtles only in books. In the backdrop of global climate change, the planet's biodiversity is under threat and action is needed with the participation of all stakeholders.

5,SHC orders stepped up efforts to recover missing person,The court also summoned comprehensive reports on the matter within four weeks,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has ordered the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) and other relevant agencies to expedite their efforts to trace missing persons, particularly Khurram Kazmi.
During the court proceedings on Saturday, the heart-wrenching pleas of Kazmi's elderly father echoed through the courtroom, revealing the anguish of a parent whose son has been missing since 2021 from the Tipu Sultan area.
Despite the police providing leads on those allegedly involved in his abduction, little progress has been made in locating and securing his safe return.
Expressing dismay over the lack of progress in the case, the court underscored the urgency of finding the missing citizens.
The investigating officer disclosed that Kazmi had affiliations with a banned organisation, prompting ongoing efforts to locate him.
The court ordered the JIT and other concerned agencies to intensify their investigative efforts. The court also summoned comprehensive reports from the provincial task force, provincial government, federal government, and police authorities within four weeks.

As many as 4,000 B.Ed. or M.Ed./ M.A. qualified teachers (from both government and private sector) took the test, of which 646 cleared and secured an Elementary (Class 1-8) Teaching Licence.
The test contained two sections; 40 marks were dedicated to assessing candidates’ content knowledge via Multiple Choice Questions; while 60 marks were dedicated to assessing pedagogical content knowledge via Constructed Response Questions (descriptive questions). Candidates were required to obtain at least 20 out of 40 and 30 out of 60 marks respectively in order to clear the test. The goal of setting separate passing heads in each section was to ensure that licensed teachers have mastery over both the content and ways of teaching.
Sindh Education Minister, Syed Sardar Ali Shah reaffirms his dedication to advancing education in Sindh, saying, “As we celebrate the success of our teachers in obtaining their licences, I am reminded of the pivotal role, they play in shaping the future of our nation. This achievement underscores our collective commitment to providing our students with the highest standards of education.”
He pledges to continue working tirelessly alongside educators, stakeholders, and partners to implement initiatives that further enhance the quality of education in Sindh. “Together we will strive to create an inclusive and innovative learning environment that empowers our students to excel and thrive in an ever-changing world.”
He further added, “Sindh government will keep putting efforts to take all necessary steps for formulating policies and implementing them. The cooperation from the private sector in government initiatives is evident that we are united towards a common goal.”
A total 3,023 in-service government teachers took this test, of which 445 passed (14.7%), while out of the 977 private sector candidates, only 201 passed (20.6%). Government teachers, who have secured this licence, will be eligible for promotion into BPS-16 while successful candidates from the private sector will be eligible for appointment to BPS-16 posts, subject to Sindh Public Service Commission rules.
Furthermore, the Sindh Education Department is considering an additional professional allowance for senior government teachers, who are already at BPS-16 and higher, and have secured a teaching licence.
To accommodate newly licensed teachers, Sindh government has approved the creation of 700 new posts of Elementary School Teachers (eligible to teach grades 1-8) at BPS-16. Previously, Junior Elementary School Teachers (JEST) were being inducted at BPS-14 and were required to have completed graduation in any field. These new 700 vacancies will be reserved for only licensed Elementary School Teachers.
Karachi region had the highest passing percentage in the in-service government teacher category at 31% (95 candidates passed out of 305), followed by Hyderabad region at 16% (49 passed out of 301) and Sukkur region at 15% (107 passed out of 706). Karachi also had the highest passing percentage in the private sector teacher category at 53% (79 passed out of 150), followed by Sukkur region at 26% (59 passed out of 228) and Larkana region at 16% (44 passed out of 271).
Sukkur region had the highest total number of passing government teachers at 107, followed by Karachi region with 95 and Larkana region with 91. Karachi region had the highest number of passing private sector candidates at 79, followed by Sukkur region at 59 and Larkana region at 44. Overall, Karachi, Sukkur, Larkana, Shaheed Benazirabad, Hyderabad, Mirpur Khas, Banbhore regions produced 174, 166, 135, 69, 58, 38 and 6 successful candidates, respectively.
In the in-service government teacher category, the average age of passing candidates was 34; while in the private sector, it was 27.
The passing rate for men was 11% (217 passed out of 2006) in the in-service teacher category, while for women it was 22% (228 passed out of 1,017). In the private sector teacher category, the passing rate for men was 12% (52 passed out of 435) while for women it was 27% (149 passed out of 542).
Of the 646 qualifying candidates, 31 scored between 70 and 80 marks (out of 100), 258 scored between 60 and 70 and 357 scored between 50 and 60.
Candidates who have not cleared the licensing test will be eligible to re-appear in the test next year. Furthermore, the Sindh Teacher Education Development Authority (STEDA) is already planning to expand the licensing regime next year to include other licence categories such as the Primary and Secondary Teaching Licences.
This teaching licensing initiative is an example of the good work that results from a strong vision, political continuity and partnerships between the public and private sector.

7,"19 days on, police yet to arrest rapists of woman",The victim expressed frustration at the lack of progress in the investigation,"Nineteen days on, police have yet to arrest two suspects involved in the rape of a mother of two who was lured with a promise of job. The victim, wife of Ali Shan, narrated her harrowing ordeal while talking to The Express Tribune.
According to the victim, she had befriended a man identified as Syed Ali on Facebook two months ago, who subsequently lured her to an apartment in Gulistan-e-Jauhar, Block 19, with the promise of employment.
As soon as she reached his flat, she found Mubeen, a friend of Syed Ali, already present. At his friend's instructions, Mubeen threatened her with a handgun, warning her that raising alarm would result in dire consequences. Despite her pleas and disclosure of being a mother of two, the accused sexually assaulted her.
The victim reported the incident at Sharea Faisal police station, where a case was registered against Syed Ali and Mubeen. She also underwent a medical examination, during which DNA samples were collected.
However, the victim expressed frustration at the lack of progress in the investigation, claiming that police efforts seemed limited, with only one raid conducted thus far. Subsequent visits to the police station yielded little cooperation from the investigating officer.
Adding to her distress, the victim revealed that both Syed Ali and Mubeen have been granted pre-arrest bail. She has since appealed to police bosses, including IG Sindh, AIG Karachi, DIG East, and other officers, urging them to expedite the arrest of the accused and ensure that they face punishment.

8,Trans community observes ‘Visibility Day’,"The day serves as a platform for transgender community to raise awareness, demand recognition","The transgender community in the metropolitan city came together on Saturday to celebrate the ‘International Transgender Day of Visibility’, advocating for peace in Palestine. The event, themed ‘Celebrating Trans Resilience and Liberation’, gathered scores of trans people at a local hotel.
Annually observed on March 31, alongside the ‘Transgender Day of Remembrance’ on November 20, this day serves as a platform for the transgender community to raise awareness and demand recognition.
“This year, we stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine, urging the international community to take decisive actions for peace,” stated Kami Sid, a transgender leader and the head of Sub Rang Society.
Explaining the significance of the day, Sid stressed the importance of visibility in advocating for transgender rights. “If we don't step forward and demand recognition, our struggles will remain invisible,” Sid added.
Sid highlighted the progress in acknowledging transgender rights but stressed the need for continued awareness, especially in urban centres like Karachi, where misconceptions persist.
While locally in Sindh, trans people are often addressed respectfully as ‘faqeer saen’, Sid underscored the importance of broader societal acceptance and understanding.
According to Sid, Karachi is home to over 60,000 trans persons, reflecting the community's significant presence in the metropolis.
The event drew participation from over a hundred trans persons from various parts of Karachi, reflecting a united call for visibility, recognition, and peace.
