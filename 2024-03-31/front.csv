0,"Pakistan prioritises US ties for peace, prosperity","In response to Biden’s letter, PM welcomes bilateral cooperation","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Sunday that Pakistan attached “high importance to its relations with the United States” and wanted to work with Washington to achieve the common goal of global peace and security and the development of the region.
The prime minister sent his reply to a letter written by the US President Joe Biden last week – the first communication between the White House and any Pakistani leader since the current US administration came to power nearly four years ago.
“Pakistan attaches high importance to its relations with the United States,” Shehbaz wrote in response to Biden’s letter. “Pakistan wants to work with the United States to achieve the common goal of global peace and security and development and prosperity of the region,” he added.
President Biden probably knows more about Pakistan than any other US politician since he remained engaged with Islamabad first as chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee and then as the vice president in former president Barack Obama’s administration.
Perhaps that played a part in his approach towards Pakistan when he opted not to directly engage with former prime minister Imran Khan, when he was elected in 2020. He never telephoned Imran or Shehbaz, who succeeded the PTI founder in April 2022.
Against this backdrop, the letter he wrote to Shehbaz came as a surprise for many.

Observers believe that Army Chief Gen Asim Munir’s visit to the US, the role of the Pentagon and US Ambassador to Islamabad Donald Blome seemed to have all contributed to the White House’s re-engagement with Pakistan at the highest level.
The reason for the renewed US interest may be stemming from the situation unfolding in Afghanistan.
Pakistan, the US and several reports suggested that terrorist groups are gaining ground in Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021.
The US may need Pakistan’s support in the future to tackle any terror threat. That is why Washington wants to remain engaged with Pakistan. For Islamabad, Washington’s support for the revival of economy is crucial given the leverage the US has over the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Shehbaz welcomed the cooperation between the two countries in the energy sector and the Green Alliance initiative. “The two countries are working together on important initiatives in the fields of energy, climate change, agriculture, health and education,” the prime minister noted.
Biden had said in his letter that enduring partnership between the US and Pakistan was critical for the security of both the people and the world. He also spoke about continued cooperation with Pakistan on health, education, economy and climate related issues.
Pakistan has sought to build relations with the US beyond the traditional areas of interests such as security and Afghanistan. Islamabad is keen to develop its relationship with Washington based on the trade, investment and commercial ties.
Observers, however, are sceptical if such cooperation can be realised given the US priorities and larger geostrategic issues. They believe that the security, Afghanistan and counterterrorism will continue to provide the basis for any cooperation between Pakistan and the US.

1,Govt drops petrol bomb days before Eid,Price of fuel hiked by Rs9.66 per litre from today,"The new government on Sunday increased the price of petrol by Rs9.66 per litre effective from Monday (today) in line with the fluctuation in global oil prices -- just as the inflation-hit people were preparing to celebrate the upcoming Eidul Fitr.
However, it decreased the price of high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs3.32 per litre on the recommendation of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
Petrol will now be available at Rs289.41 per litre against its previous price of Rs279.75 per litre.
Meanwhile, HSD will now cost Rs282.24 per litre instead of Rs285.56.
Justifying the hike, the finance ministry in a statement said the price of petrol had increased in the international market during the last fortnight while the rate of HSD had marginally declined.
It added that the government had accordingly decided to revise the existing prices of petroleum products from April 1.
The ministry further said the price adjustments were in line with the government’s policy of passing on the variations of prices in the international market to the domestic one.
It said the consumer price of HSD had been accordingly decreased once again, after a downward revision in the middle of March this year.

Petrol is mainly used in cars and motorcycles.
Its use in Punjab is higher as CNG stations in the province lack the supply of indigenous gas. They are provided with expensive imported gas.
HSD is widely used in transport and agricultural sectors. Therefore, the decision to cut its price will have a healthy impact on the farmers and other people as it may reduce the inflationary impact.
On Ogra’s recommendation, the price of LPG has been reduced to Rs250,341.58 per ton from Rs256,790.16 per ton, registering a decline of Rs6,448.58 per ton.
An LPG cylinder’s price has been reduced from Rs3,030.12 to Rs2,954.03 for domestic consumers.
Kerosene oil and light-diesel oil (LDO) prices have also been slashed by Rs2.27 per litre and Rs0.38 per litre, respectively, from their previous rates of Rs186.39 per litre and Rs167.80 per litre.

Kerosene is primarily used for adulteration and lighting in remote areas, while LDO is used by flour mills and a few power plants.
Currently, the government is charging a levy of Rs60 per litre on almost all petroleum products.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is pushing the government to impose a general sales tax (GST) of Rs18 per litre on the petroleum products.
Presently, there is no GST on these products.
If the government imposes the GST, the prices of petroleum products will go up further up in the coming months.

3,K-P Senate election in doldrums,ECP warned that K-P Senate elections will be postponed if provincial government refuses to hold assembly session,"In what appears to be an attempt to prevent newly elected opposition candidates from participating in the April 2 Senate polls, the PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) government has instructed the provincial assembly speaker to convene an assembly session on the same day.
Although the session's timing has not been specified, it is expected to commence after the Senate election on Tuesday evening.
The ruling party in the province has also approached the Peshawar High Court (PHC) to intervene and prevent the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) from postponing the Senate elections due to the non-administration of oaths to opposition parties’ candidates-elect.
Earlier, The PTI, stripped of its election symbol before the February 8 general elections, fielded its candidates as independents. Subsequently, PTI-backed independents aligned with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) to secure reserved seats for women and minorities.
However, the ECP rejected the party’s request, asserting that the SIC failed to submit its priority list for such seats before the polls. The ECP decided to distribute reserved seats among other parties based on their general seats.
The PHC upheld the ECP order. While hearing petitions filed by opposition parties, the court last week also directed the K-P speaker to administer oaths to MPA-elects on reserved seats to enable their participation in the Senate elections.
Now, the PTI government has called for an assembly session on election day.
The newly appointed women and minorities members will take oath as per the PHC's directive but will be unable to vote in the Senate polls, effectively aligning with the provincial government's strategy to prevent their participation.
The ECP has warned that Senate elections in K-P will be postponed if the provincial government refuses to hold the assembly session and delays the oath-taking ceremony.
Currently, the PTI-backed MPAs number 91, while opposition lawmakers total 27. If Senate elections precede the administration of oath to new MPAs elected on reserved seats, the PTI is poised to win 10 Senate seats, including two women and two technocrats’ seats, with the opposition securing just one seat.
However, if women and minority MPAs in the K-P assembly take oaths before the Senate polls, the PTI is expected to lose at least four seats, including two general and one technocrat and women's seat each.
Adviser to the K-P CM on Information Muhammad Ali Saif emphasized that the ECP is obligated by law to hold elections within a specific timeframe. He warned that any attempt by the ECP to postpone Senate elections in K-P would be challenged in the PHC as unlawful.
It was later revealed that the PTI has already petitioned the PHC, seeking to prevent the ECP from ""illegally"" postponing the Senate polls.

4,Legacy looms over inquiry: Can former CJ do justice?,"Legal community divided over whether Jillani can steer the commission, ensure fairness","As the spotlight falls on ex-CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, the central question looms large: can the seasoned adjudicator, with a storied career behind him, steer a fair and impartial investigation into the explosive allegations levelled by the six Islamabad High Court judges.
The 75-year-old Jillani finds himself at the helm of the inquiry commission tasked with navigating the murky waters of judicial integrity in a heated political climate. However, the decision has stirred up a heated debate, with many questioning whether the former top judge can ensure a fair investigation.
Weighing on the matter, Abdul Moiz Jaferii expressed about the commission's ability to achieve anything substantial. He believed that the commission could achieve only one thing: to lower the reputation of the judges who have complained of influence, as well as diminishing the reputation of the judge heading the commission. He went on to say that the move was an invitation to destroy ex-CJP Jilani's legacy. ""I’m surprised Jilani sahab agreed.”
Meanwhile, representing the Pakistan Bar Council in the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), Akhtar Hussain commended the six IHC judges for their boldness in addressing a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
He said that the SJC was required to do two things: first, to provide guidelines to the judges regarding their response to interference/intimidation by agencies. Secondly, the SJC should examine the conduct of the IHC chief justice in light of the letter.
However, the PBC representative believed that CJP Isa did the right thing by obtaining the endorsement of the inquiry commission from the full court. He doubted whether the commission would be successful in creating deterrence.
Akhtar Hussain also criticised the political parties for failing to throw their weight behind the six IHC judges.
On the other hand, a senior lawyer expressed doubts regarding the leadership of the inquiry commission by ex-CJP Jilani. He expressed hope that the former chief justice might reconsider and decline to be part of the commission. He claimed that he had learned that Jilani was contemplating expressing regret.
Currently, the legal community is at loggerheads over the establishment of an inquiry commission spearheaded by Jillani.
The superior bars, led by the Independent Group, are staunchly supporting Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and the government's decision to set up an inquiry commission to investigate the IHC judges' letters.
Conversely, the bars, led by Professional Group, are vehemently opposing the formation of the inquiry commission, calling for the SC to take suo motu notice in this matter.
Meanwhile, it was learnt that Jillani will commence his duties in a couple of days. Jillani, often referred to as 'the gentleman judge' for his mild demeanour, retired in July 2014.
Opinions are split over his nomination. Former CJP Jawwad S Khawaja, in his book, has made negative remarks about him.
Accepting the responsibility of heading the commission, the former chief justice stated that he would commence work on the matter after Eidul Fitr, upon the issuance of the notification.
In October 2017, the government nominated the former chief justice as a judge ad hoc in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Kulbushan Jadhav case.
He served as a judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan from July 31, 2004, to December 11, 2013, and subsequently as the 21st chief justice of Pakistan from December 12, 2013, until July 5, 2014.
Born on July 6, 1949, in Multan, he completed his Master's in Political Science from Forman Christian College and LLB from the University of Punjab, Lahore.
He began practising law at the Multan district courts in 1974 and was elected general secretary of the district bar association in 1976. He became a member of the Punjab Bar Council in 1978 and was appointed assistant advocate general of Punjab in July 1979.
Enrolled as an advocate of the Supreme Court in 1983, he was appointed additional advocate general of Punjab in 1993.
Justice (retd) Jillani took oath as a judge of the Lahore High Court on August 7, 1994, and was elevated as a judge of the Supreme Court on July 31, 2004, serving until the imposition of the state of emergency on November 3, 2007.
Due to his refusal to take a fresh oath, he was rendered dysfunctional. He retook the oath as a judge of the Supreme Court in 2008.
Justice Jillani has participated in numerous international conferences and colloquiums, addressing issues such as the 'domestic application of international human rights,' 'gender justice,' 'alternative dispute resolution,' 'forced marriages,' 'transnational child abduction,' and 'religious tolerance’.
