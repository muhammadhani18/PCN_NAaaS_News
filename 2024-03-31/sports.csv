1,Power pilfers in the crosshairs,"Smugglers, hoarders also face stern action","Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has ordered a zero-tolerance policy against electricity theft, smuggling and hoarding.
Chairing a meeting of the energy department, she directed the authorities concerned to conduct a grand operation across the province against electricity theft, smuggling and hoarding to implement a policy devised in a meeting presided over by the prime minister. She directed the officials to fix targets in this regard and present a compliance report after a month.
“Every connection, including industries, factories, shops, houses and shopping malls, will be checked. The relevant authorities will be responsible in case of any failure,” she warned.
The chief minister said anyone found involved in power theft, smuggling or hoarding should not be offered any lenience.
She called for legislation for severe punishments and heavy fines for the elimination of electricity theft. She highlighted that electricity theft is already a cognisable offence, so arrests and immediate punishment should be ensured.
“Action will also be taken against government officials involved in electricity theft. Black sheep within the system should be identified and tried under the relevant laws,” she stressed.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said the energy ministry would also monitor all electricity distribution companies (DISCOs) of the province.
She issued directives to form a task force of experts and government representatives to devise an effective strategy to curb the menace. This task force will monitor the ministry of power, the performance of DISCOs and the operation against electricity theft.
The participants of the meeting were informed that electricity worth Rs100 billion is stolen in Punjab every year.
The chief minister reiterated, “There will be zero tolerance on electricity theft in Punjab. Billions of rupees lost in electricity theft will be spent on health, education and development of the people.”
In a message on the Zero Waste Day, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz stressed the importance of responsible use of essential commodities and waste management.
“The world is facing numerous environmental challenges. We need an industrialised economy where resources are used efficiently and minimum waste is generated,” she said and added, “People should adopt eco-friendly alternatives by reducing single-use plastics.”
The chief minister said, “A comprehensive waste management system is being introduced in all major cities of Punjab. For the first time, a sustainable and effective system of village sanitation is being devised.”
She added, “It is my commitment to see every city, village and neighborhood clean.”
“We must choose sustainable products and plan to reduce food waste,” she stated.
The chief minister said, “Old items need to be repaired, donated or repurposed. Do not throw recyclables in the trash, and sorting waste is essential. By working together, a healthy environment and secure future can be achieved from the waste materials.”

2,"Heavy rains, hail storm lash Dera Ghazi Khan",Farmers hit hard as floodwaters devastate crops,"Koh-e-Sulaiman in Dera Ghazi Khan have borne the brunt of heavy rains, hailstorms, and subsequent flooding, wreaking havoc on agricultural crops and disrupting power supply.
In response to the widespread damage, residents and farmers have demanded of the Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to declare the region a calamity-hit zone.
The recent bout of heavy rainfall, experienced not only in Dera Ghazi Khan but also in neighbouring cities of Punjab, brought temporary relief from scorching temperatures but brought catastrophe to the tribal areas nestled within the Sulaiman Mountains. Areas such as Mount Sulaiman, Fort Munro, Sakhi Sarwar, Rakhi Gaj, Taunsa, and their surroundings faced torrents of water, inundating fields and causing extensive harm to wheat and chickpea crops.
The night's relentless downpour and hailstorm proved catastrophic for agricultural communities residing in the mountainous terrain.
Wheat crops spanning over 40,000 acres in Town Sokar, South Village, Chit Pani, Baghlani, and Jhok Rohal of Taunsa were obliterated.
Furthermore, the overflow of the Sanghar Ravine wreaked havoc in Town Ashraf, Jarhi Leghari, Jarrah, Aara, Mubarak, Lingah, Geha, and Pulwa North.
The unyielding deluge has not only decimated crops across thousands of acres but also raised concerns about food scarcity in the region.
Despite fervent prayers at mosques to halt the rainfall, efforts to appease the weather gods have proven ineffective, exacerbating anxiety among residents.
Additionally, the disruption of power supply, owing to multiple tripped feeders, has compounded the woes of remote communities.
In light of the widespread devastation, residents and farmers have called relief and assistance to those affected by the heavy rains.

3,PA passes Rs617b supplementary budget,Opposition lawmakers criticise budgetary allocations,"The Punjab Assembly passed a supplementary budget of over Rs617 billion for the fiscal year 2022-23 amidst strong protests from the Opposition. They vehemently opposed the budget, alleging it was illegitimate and aimed at undermining the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
During Saturday's proceedings, Opposition lawmakers delivered fiery speeches criticising both the budgetary allocations and the actions of the caretaker government, which they accused of targeting the PTI.
Deputy Speaker of the Punjab Assembly Zaheer Iqbal Channar requested the Opposition to remove play cards bearing the message ""release 804"" from the microphones, but the Opposition refused to comply.
The Opposition lambasted the caretaker government and police officials for their treatment of PTI workers, alleging that police did little to combat crime but made concerted efforts to incarcerate PTI lawmakers and file false FIRs against them.
They highlighted a police report indicating that over 200 police officials were involved in drug abuse, condemning the allocation of funds for the police force while such issues persisted.
In response to Opposition’s queries, Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman addressed concerns about missing details in the budget. He clarified that Rs208 billion was spent on purchasing wheat and Rs119 billion on road infrastructure during Chaudhry Pervez Elahi's tenure as Chief Minister of Punjab.
He contrasted this with the brief tenure of Hamza Shehbaz Sharif, during which little money was spent, and highlighted spending under former CM Mohsin Naqvi.
Following the finance minister's remarks, the Deputy Speaker initiated the process of passing the supplementary budget, prompting strong protests from the Opposition.
They chanted slogans and tore copies of the budget, gathering in front of the deputy speaker's chair to protest the approval. However, the deputy speaker prorogued the session after passing the budget indefinitely.
In response to Opposition requisition, Speaker of the Punjab Assembly Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan summoned a new session for April 1 at 11 am.

4,Prime suspects in Balaj murder declared proclaimed offenders,Police initiate steps for red warrants,"Prime suspects Khawaja Tareef alias Teefi Butt and Khawaja Aqeel alias Gogi Butt in the Ameer Balaj murder case have been declared proclaimed offenders (POs).
They had evaded arrest for the past one-and-a-half month.
According to police sources, it is suspected that Teefi has fled abroad and Gogi is hiding in the county.
According to Organised Crime Unit (OCU) DIG Imran Kishwar, the police have initiated the procedure to get red warrants issued through the interior minister against the suspects after declaring them proclaimed offenders.
The warrants help bring back the accused to the country from abroad with the help of the International Police.
Ameer Balaj Tipu was attending a marriage ceremony in a housing society last month when he was shot dead by a suspected shooter later identified as Muzzafar Hussain, an old gunman of Teefi Butt, over a 30-year-old enmity.
Muzzafar was shot dead instantly after the murder.
Teefi and Gogi were nominated in FIR lodged by Ameer Moasab, the younger brother of Balaj.
The sources said the investigations so far pointed at Teefi as the main character in masterminding and executing the murder.
A close friend, Ahsan, was arrested for spying and surveillance of Ameer Balaj for Teefi to facilitate his murder over a promise of Rs50 million. He had received the amount. Ahsan was sent in remand.
DIG Imran Kishwar said the investigations so far had indicated that Teefi was the prime suspect.

5,Patwari culture continues to undermine bureaucracy,"Pakistan’s core province, Punjab, still faces delays in the digitalization process of land records","Where the global shift towards bureaucratic digitalization has significantly prevented the probability of human error and malpractice from negatively influencing state data thereby improving departmental efficiency and transparency, in Pakistan’s core province, Punjab, which still faces delays in its digitalization process of land records, tasks that can be performed conveniently with a few taps on a screen are still carried out by discreditable Patwaris.
In 2001, the computerization of the Board of Revenue Punjab was initiated with the goal of streamlining ownership processes including the buying and selling of property, claims of inheritance and transfer of property so that the century’s old Patwari system, which involved the manual registration and collection of records by an accountant, could be abrogated. However, even after the passage of 23 years and the combined expenditure of billions of rupees on the pilot project, the digitalization process remains far from completion and the Patwari, who is the ‘king of revenue’ in Punjab, still holds the power to financially exploit the common people by demanding bribes for settling disputes over personal property, land acquisition and inheritance after the death of the proprietor.
Faisal Mehmood, a local spotted fidgeting outside the Patwari’s office, disclosed that he had been visiting the officer for documentation concerning his newly purchased property since the past one month. “Sometimes, I am told that the Patwari is not present, while on other occasions, the representative of the Patwari asks me to come after a week. I have also visited the digital land record center but their system is down,” shared Mehmood, who had also been told by the officers that he could expedite the process by paying a bribe anywhere between Rs7,000 to Rs10,000.
On the other hand, Fida Hussain, a Patwari in the Finance Department refuted such accusations of bribery. “Regardless of how much our salary is, we have to bear the regular expenses of all functioning officers out of our own pockets. Therefore, when people willingly offer us money to get their job done, we have no reason not to accept it,” maintained Hussain.
Contrary to Hussain’s validations, records obtained by the Express Tribune indicate that 35 per cent of all anti-corruption cases that are filed to the accountability watchdog are against Patwaris and revenue officers.
 
“More than 2,000 cases have been registered against revenue department officers and Patwaris during the past three years. Bail has been granted to some officers while others are still in jail,” unveiled an officer from the Anti-Corruption Establishment Punjab, while speaking to the Express Tribune.
“Even as the province is steadily shifting towards digitalizing land records, completely eradicating the Patwari culture will take time,” said Mushtaq Ahmed, the Deputy Tehsildar of the Finance Department.
Expanding on the same, Shahid Hussain, an IT specialist believed that it was not possible to fully computerize data dating back to the British era. “In many cases, the government does not have access to these records since many have been burnt to ashes in fires breakouts at courts,” he added.
In this regard, an officer from the Punjab Land Records Authority revealed that currently more than 150 land centers in Punjab are undergoing digitalization. “90% of the records across 39 districts have already been digitalized. Traditional Patwari offices are being constructed in a contemporary manner. Copies can be obtained online and the time for registration has also been reduced to two months. The government is recruiting more than 3000 Patwaris with an educational background in modern technology education,” claimed the official, who further asserted that corruption cases had been reduced to half with the digital record system.
