0,PSX breaks records amid stellar performance,"KSE-100 index adds 1,853 points, or 2.84% WoW, settles at 67,005.11","In a much-awaited rally, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) demonstrated exceptional performance and surged to a new record high above 67,000 points during the outgoing week, where records were eclipsed a couple of times.
Investors resorted to value hunting as they took encouragement from relative economic stability, a fast-track process for privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and other state-owned enterprises. Pakistan government’s determination to seek a new, larger loan programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a continuous increase in foreign currency reserves and the strengthening rupee also aided the market’s advance, where the KSE100 index gained over 1,850 points during the week.
At the beginning of the week on Monday, stocks experienced a significant recovery, driven by the World Bank’s approval of $150 million project financing and completion of final review under the IMF’s $3 billion standby arrangement (SBA). Next day, the KSE-100 index continued its bullish momentum from the previous session, primarily fuelled by a surge in stock valuations in oil and banking sectors.
PSX soared to a record high on Wednesday as it crossed the 66,500 milestone over progress in the privatisation process for PIA and optimism about a new and larger IMF loan programme. The market continued its highly bullish trend next day as well and surpassed the 67,000-point barrier to a new record high as news emerged about the classification of Pakistan as a secondary emerging market in the FTSE Global Equity Indices.
However, on Friday, the two-day recordbreaking rally paused as the bourse dropped nearly 140 points due to profit-taking by investors, an unimpressive economic growth and a hike in power tariffs. The benchmark KSE-100 index added 1,853 points, or 2.84% week-on-week (WoW), and settled at 67,005.11. JS Global analyst Shagufta Irshad, in her report, wrote that the KSE-100 index reached an all-time-high above 67,000 during the week, taking WoW gains to 3%.
Average trading volumes surged 12% WoW in terms of shares and 7% in terms of value, following stagnation in the previous two weeks with the start of Ramazan. “PIA’s momentum persisted this week as it surged by an additional 23%, fuelled by the accelerating privatisation proceedings,” she said. The company’s board of directors gave the green light to its unbundling and privatisation, signalling a significant step forward in the process. “Concurrently, the new government reiterated its firm commitment to finalising the transaction by the end of June, which further boosted investor confidence in PIA’s future prospects,” she said.
In addition, the government disclosed its plans to sell shares in Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) to Gulf investors. The government also announced that it would engage with the IMF for a new, larger and longer facility in the upcoming spring meetings to be held in mid-April. In another notable announcement, Pakistan’s GDP grew only 1% during 2QFY24 from 2.5% in 1QFY24, where a robust cotton harvest was the key driver of growth.
Moreover, SBP’s reserves stood at $8 billion, the JS analyst added. Arif Habib Limited (AHL) said, in its report, that throughout the week the stock market showcased a stellar performance, taking the index to an all-time high of 67,246 points. “The robust momentum is attributable to value hunting by investors post-stability on the economic front and the ongoing progress related to the privatisation of stateowned enterprises,” it said.
On the economic front, the SBP revealed that repatriation of profits and dividends on foreign investment in Pakistan climbed up $534 million and settled at $759 million in 8MFY24 compared to $225 million in the same period of last year. Additionally, the National Accounts Committee disclosed GDP growth of 1% in 2QFY24 amid higher production of crops including cotton, rice and maize. Foreigners’ buying continued during the week, clocking in at $3.6 million compared to net buying of $2 million last week, AHL added.

1,"Centre, Sindh agree to collaborate","Discuss at-source deductions, gas price hikes, attracting foreign investment","Sindh Chief Minister (CM) Syed Murad Ali Shah and Federal Minister for Finance Mohammad Aurangzeb have agreed to collaborate in an attempt to attract foreign investment and boost exports, thereby enhancing financial stability of the province and the country. This partnership emerged in a meeting between the two officials held at CM House on Saturday. The meeting was attended by PSCM Agha Wasif, Additional Secretary Ministry of Finance Amjad Mahmood, and Provincial Secretary Finance Fayaz Jatoi.
Shah raised concerns, saying that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and other federal entities were illegally implementing atsource deductions, contrary to established policy. He highlighted that the federal government has been deducting money from the provincial government’s head through at-source deduction. Recently, it has deducted a total of Rs13.4 billion, out of which Rs8.2 billion was for Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) and Rs5.2 billion was for Sukkur Electric Power Company (SEPCO) bills.
Moreover, the CM pointed out that his government has always paid its electricity bills on time. He asserted that if there were any outstanding bills that needed to be reconciled, the federal government should have brought the issue to their attention instead of making at-source deductions.
Shah also disclosed that the FBR, after reading a news item of the cars registered in Sindh from 1948 to 2015, had deducted Rs6 billion of the province at source. Despite the resolution of the issue, the amount has not been refunded. Assuring the CM, the finance minister said he was working to develop a proper professional working relationship between the federal and provincial organisations. “The federal and provincial organisations and institutions have to work together, learn from each other’s expertise, support each other for growth and cooperate for collective uplift and development,” he said. Additionally, Aurangzeb assured the Shah that the at-source deduction issue would be resolved amicably.
During the meeting, both officials discussed the price escalation of industrial gas. To this, Shah said that the industrialists were quite upset with the increased prices. Acknowledging his concerns, the finance minister said that during his meeting with the industrialists, they also complained to him. Therefore, both parties agreed to discuss the matter with the federal minister for petroleum to resolve the issue. Furthermore, the Sindh chief minister said that no new scheme has been given to the Sindh government in the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), as compared to the other provinces for the last eight years.

Both Aurangzeb and Shah agreed that the issue of PSDP’s new schemes would be discussed with the federal minister for planning and development.
It was also agreed that the federal and provincial governments would work together to develop the agriculture sector on scientific and modern methods. They emphasised that there was amplepotential to cultivate export-quality crops, vegetables, fruits, and dairy products so that they could be exported to earn foreign exchange. The CM informed the federal finance minister that he was working to introduce new technologies to improve crop yield and measures being taken to ensure the provision of certified seed in the market.
Discussing the reconstruction of flood-devastated infrastructure, the CM said that houses, school buildings, and roads were being reconstructed. He expressed concerns that although the donor agencies have extended a helping hand in the reconstruction of flood-affected infrastructure, the funds have not trickled down as was pledged by the international community.
Both ministers also agreed to attract foreign investment in different sectors for which investment procedures would be made simple and automated. Moreover, Aurangzeb appreciated the Sindh chief minister’s efforts in establishing one of the best public-private partnership units.

2,Banks to pay tax on lower lending,Govt will collect 10-16% in taxes if bank credit drops below 50% of deposits,"The government will collect an additional tax in the range of 10% to 16% from banks in case their lending to the private sector falls below 50% of total deposits, aimed at encouraging them to provide more financing to ramp up business activities ahead of a potential drop in borrowing cost.
The record high policy rate of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) at 22% resulted in default by many businesses and households on bank loan repayments in 2023. This led to a spike in bad loans of banks to a 14-year high at Rs62 billion. Topline Research reported that banks having advance-to-deposit ratio (ADR) below 40% would pay a 16% tax on the income generated from investment in government debt securities like treasury bills (T-bills) and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs).
Financial institutions will pay a 10% tax in case their ADR stands above 40% but remains below 50%. There will be no such tax on banks keeping the ADR above 50%. In 2023, the ADR of almost all the banks listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) stood below 50%, except for three banks namely Samba Bank, Faysal Bank and The Bank of Punjab, the research house said.
Arif Habib Limited economist Sana Tawfik elaborated that banks in their annual and quarterly analyst briefings revealed they had been subject to the tax in case of a low ADR in 2022. They, however, got exemption in calendar year 2023. “Technically, as per law and in principle, the tax has been reinstated in 2024 considering the exemption was only for one year,” she said. Some banks, however, are waiting for the upcoming budget to have clarity whether the tax has become applicable again in 2024.
The re-imposition of the tax may encourage banks to revert to the old practice where they stopped accepting higher deposits from clients to show compliance with the ADR requirement. Low deposits in the last month of 2023, ie, December automatically took advances to the private sector on the upside, showing the banks met the ADR requirement and were not liable to pay the tax for 2022, she said.
Tawfik was of the view that the government should establish a new mechanism to check ADR compliance, like asking banks to maintain the ratio on a weekly, monthly or quarterly basis instead of once in a year in December. This condition will encourage them to step up lending to the private sector in its true sense. Though some banks are eager to provide more credit to private businesses, some others do not want to take extra risk in a high interest rate scenario, where chances are high for an increase in non-performing loans (NPLs).
In a report titled “Banks: all-time high interest rates take NPL accretion at 14-year high”, JS Global Head of Research Amreen Soorani said “analysis of the NPL stock in calendar year 2023 shows an absolute increase of Rs62 billion – the highest since 2010, taking credit cost to Rs52 billion. The infection ratio deteriorated 41 basis points year-on-year to 6.2% in calendar year 2023.”
The monetary tightening cycle generally sparks concerns about the asset quality of banks and potentially large provisioning expenses. This cycle, which has seen a 15-percentage-point expansion in policy rate to 22% in the past three years, is no different when it comes to similar concerns, she said. Moreover, in the midst of such concerns, the sector faced regulations discouraging a lower ADR by penalising the same via higher taxes, which were later exempted for calendar year 2023, but remain in place for CY24 and beyond.
“This exemption for CY23 led banks to move away from loan disbursements this year, reducing the ADR from 53% to 44%, as lending demand also reduced amid higher borrowing costs, coupled with the banking sector cherry-picking blue-chip borrowers to shield its asset quality.”
Soorani analysed segment-wise loan portfolio and growth of various banks where the most common growth segments were textiles, individual consumers, agriculture and energy. These sectors cumulatively account for almost 45% of the lending book of most of the banks listed at the PSX. Other than the agriculture sector, the remaining top segments have registered no growth this year.
Textiles are amongst the large contributing segments in the banking sector’s lending portfolio for sample banks (having 85% of the sector’s market capitalisation at the PSX), maintaining a 17% loan portfolio. “The contribution to NPL accretion has been a mixed bag with varied segments for some banks while concentrated for others, however, textiles were again the segment highlighted more than others,” she said.

3,Hyderabad’s motorcycle industry seeks govt aid,"Industrialists warn of mass unemployment, call for policy support as Chinese assemblers face collapse","Hyderabad industrialists are calling on the government to establish a policy and introduce a motorbike financing scheme, stressing the importance of safeguarding the assembling plants of Chinese petrolversion motorbikes to prevent the collapse of this struggling industry, which could lead to increased unemployment.
Speaking to The Express Tribune they mentioned that there are a total of nine fullyfledged assembling plants, with four located in Hyderabad, two in Karachi, three in Lahore, and one in Sialkot. “Back in 2002, there was a significant surge in Chinese motorcycle production, with approximately 135 assembling units established nationwide,” stated Auto Sector Analyst Mohammad Sabir Shaikh.“These units were officially producing 900,000 motorbikes annually, alongside an informal production of 2.5 million.
Additionally, there were over 1 million motorcycles from Japanese brands like Honda, Yamaha, and Suzuki. We were even exporting bikes to Afghanistan and several African countries.” He highlighted the industry’s challenges, citing consecutive setbacks in 2009, 2016, and 2020-2021, the latter occurring shortly after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Hyderabad was once the thriving hub of the Chinese motorbike assembling industry from 2000 to 2010. Now it is struggling to survive,” explained Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry (HCSTSI) President Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani. “During this period, around nine modern motorbike-cum-rickshaw units operated, attracting hundreds of thousands of former glass bangle workers to transition into this industry.”
He highlighted that the industry began shuttering plants not only in Hyderabad but also across the country due to insufficient support and proper government policies. Factors contributing to this downturn include escalating business costs, rising raw material expenses, soaring utility bills, a 22% interest rate, currency depreciation against the US dollar, and political and economic instability.
Stressing the need for sustainable growth in the local industry to strengthen the national economy, he also pointed out that bike dealers, who often provided bikes on credit, were unable to fulfil their payment obligations to assemblers on time, exacerbating the situation. CEO of Memon Motors, Mohammad Saleem Memon, shared that their company introduced auto rickshaws under the Super Star brand in 1992 and ventured into the motorbike industry in 2001-2002, when a 70-CC motorbike cost Rs32,000.
Currently, it sells for Rs103,000, operating within a market with a slim profit margin. He mentioned that four renowned brands of Hyderabad motorbikes—Super Star, Unique, Hi-Speed, and Express—are struggling to maintain viability, producing around 8,000 to 10,000 units per month. This is a significant decline from the peak production period when they assembled over 40,000 units monthly

4,Pakistan eyes $2b in health funding,"Hopes to collaborate with US in areas of family planning, nutrition, diabetes among others","Pakistan is eyeing foreign funding worth $2 billion to fight various diseases over the next four years, while also seeking an opportunity to collaborate with the United States in the area of health security.
The funding is being secured for interventions in various areas, mainly family planning, nutrition, hepatitis C elimination, and diabetes control, in addition to containing the spread of various viral diseases. Dr Nadeem Jan, former interim health minister, mentioned that the health ministry has been trying to secure $1.6 billion in grants and the remaining $400 million in loans.
Dr Jan stated that during the interim government’s tenure, the Ministry of Health received commitments of around $1 billion from GAVI, the Global Fund, the World Bank, USAID, the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the French Development Agency, and private charities. The process for obtaining another $1 billion in grants and loans has been initiated, with discussions beginning with the Global Fund and non-governmental stakeholders, according to Dr Jan.
In the first communication by any US President in almost five years, President Joe Biden has mentioned “greater health security” as one of the areas for advancing relations with Pakistan. The US has also shown interest in advancing relations in the areas of economic growth and access to education for all. In January this year, Pakistan also held a global health security summit. Biden’s emphasis on cooperation in health security provides an opportunity for Pakistan to seek support to fight various diseases. Dr Jan highlighted that the Global Health Security Momentum, an amalgam of 70 countries, can be utilised for health and climate gains, given Pakistan’s global health leadership. This momentum can also be used to advocate for climate justice.
Pakistan is eyeing a $289 million grant from the Global Fund, $210 million from Gavi, $100 million from the World Bank, $30 million from the UK government, and $100 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The caretaker government had initiated discussions for a $100 million loan from the IDB and $55 million from the French Development Agency, said the former health minister.
The US government has also planned a $50 million grant to Pakistan in the area of health security, with the process already initiated, according to Dr Jan. The UK government is also considering supporting Pakistan’s global health security agenda. China has also shown interest in investing around $300 million in modernising the health sector in Pakistan, he added.
Dr Jan highlighted that Pakistan loses over 15% of its GDP to ill health, malnutrition, population explosion, and communicable and non-communicable diseases. However, the country only allocates 1% of its GDP to health, which should be increased to 3%. He added that the health-economy nexus remains unexplored, holding huge synergistic potential. Pakistan’s pharmaceutical sector largely remains protected, leading to loss of productivity and lack of appetite for exports. He stressed the need to increase pharmaceutical exports and invest in human resources.
He also underscored the imperative for the new government to steer global health security leadership and formalise the “Islamabad Pandemic Accord” with member states, reached at the summit in January. The onus is on the new government to capitalise on and maximise this new health and economic model for Pakistan’s health sector and economy, remarked the former minister. This may require tough decisions that could be politically challenging but are nationally highly desirable.
The National Health Support Programme, amounting to $432 million, has been made operational after which the second tranche of budgetary support will be released to Pakistan to fill the gap in the implementation of the essential package of health services, said Dr Jan. He stated that the interim government also established a mechanism for providing technical assistance through the development budget. Funding for the polio eradication initiative, amounting to $155 million for three years, has been secured from the IDB and other donors.
The Child Investment Foundation has also agreed to work on nutrition in Pakistan through a matching fund of approximately $100 million, with negotiations underway, he added. Dr Jan explained that integrating polio eradication efforts into government structures and ensuring government ownership will greatly benefit Pakistan in its fight against polio. By placing the responsibility within government structures there will be improved coordination, accountability, and sustainability of polio vaccination campaigns.
