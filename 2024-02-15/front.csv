0,Amid unrest PML-N eyes govt in Balochistan,Party woos independent and other parties’ members,"Amid widespread protest over alleged rigging in the recently-held elections in Balochistan, former chief minister and PML-N leader Jam Kamal Khan Alyani on Wednesday announced plans to engage with independent members and other political parties in an effort to form a coalition government in the province.
The announcement came as workers and supporters of political parties held mass protest across the province to protest against ballot stuffing and other malpractices on the polling day.
Moreover, in deadly turn of events, at least two people were killed and around a dozen injured during an exchange of fire between two rival political groups in the Hub city of Balochistan.
Meanwhile, Alyani’s statement came a day after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari announced the formation of the Balochistan government.
The PPP is yet to nominate its candidate for the slot of chief minister in the province.
However, Sarfraz Bugti, the former caretaker interior minister and Mir Sadiq Umrani, a PPP central leader, are considered to be the potential candidates for the slot of the Balochistan chief minister.
Nawab Aslam Raisani of the JUI-F and Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani of the BAP are other prominent candidates eyeing this provincial post. However, Alyani himself is also in the race for the coveted office.
“With 10 seats under its belt, the PML-N Balochistan is poised to play a significant role in the formation of the provincial government,” Alyani said.
In a post shared on social media platform X, Alyani wrote that the PML-N Balochistan was interacting with independent members as well as the rest of the parties so that a progressive and prosperous way forward could be made for the province.
In Balochistan, six independent candidates won the provincial assembly elections, making made their way to the House of 65 and their role was crucial.
The PML-N Balochistan also held its first consultative meeting after the polls chaired by party’s provincial president Sheikh Jaffar Mandokhail.
A day earlier, a shutter-down strike was observed in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan against the alleged poll rigging in the province.
Four nationalist political parties -- the BNP, PkMAP, National Party, and Hazara Democratic Party had given the call for a strike against what they claimed was record poll rigging during the recently held general elections.
Alyani’s statement comes at a crucial juncture as all parties are intensifying their efforts to ensure the smooth formation of the government in Balochistan.
By reaching out to independent members and other parties, the PML-N aims to foster cooperation and collaboration, laying the groundwork for a united approach to address the challenges facing the province.
The initiative reflects a commitment to inclusive governance and consensus-building, emphasising the importance of collective action in driving development and prosperity in Balochistan.
As discussions unfold and alliances are forged, stakeholders remain hopeful that a constructive and cohesive government will emerge, dedicated to advancing the interests of the people as well as realising the full potential of Balochistan.

1,Fazl interview makes jaw-dropping claims,"JUI-F chief says Bajwa, Faiz orchestrated no-trust vote against Imran","Feeling left out of the government race following the inconclusive vote on Feb 8 in which his party showed poorly, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Thursday accused former army chief General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa and ex-director general Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed of orchestrating the downfall of the PTI government led by Imran Khan in 2022.

The Maulana’s allegations made during an interview with a private TV channel came a day after his party rejected the election results as “rigged” and decided to sit on the opposition benches in parliament in “protest mode”.

“I was opposed to the idea of tabling a no-confidence motion against Imran Khan,” the Maulana said while referring to the events unfolded in 2022 as the country saw for the first time in its history the ouster of a prime minister through a no-confidence vote. Maulana Fazl was among top opposition leaders who spearheaded the efforts to oust the PTI founder under the banner of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM).

Coming on the heels of rapidly changing political landscape in the country and particularly at a time when the political parties who once were part of the PDM have been in the process of forming a new coalition at the Centre – a la PDM 2.0 -- the revelations would add to the controversy of removing an elected by the opposition with the help of the military establishment.

Moreover, just before his retirement the former army chief prided himself in claiming that the armed forces had learnt from history and become apolitical, adding the “political quarantine of the armed forces” will bode well for Pakistan in the long term.

“Despite some criticism and undue vilification of the armed forces through mass propaganda and meticulously crafted false narratives, the institutional resolve to remain apolitical will remain steadfast,” Bajwa had said in an interview with the UAE-based publication, Gulf News, just a day before doffing his uniform.

For its part, the PTI accused the country’s then-rulers of colluding with the US and hatching a regime change conspiracy to topple Imran’s government and blamed the military, which was led by retired Gen Bajwa at the time, for letting the then-dispensation in Islamabad go ahead with the alleged conspiracy.

In the interview, the JUI-F chief, who described himself as “a fighter and not a quitter”, elaborated on the events of the no-confidence vote and said: “They (Gen Bajwa and Gen Faiz) were in contact with all political parties regarding the no-confidence motion and they told us the way of going about it.”

Directing a fusillade of criticism at his former coalition partners, Fazl claimed that Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) spearheaded the no-confidence move against Imran, with Bajwa and Faiz providing directives to the political parties. ""I was not in favour of it, but I supported it because then the PDM (Pakistan Democratic Movement) would have said that I saved Imran Khan,"" he stated.

He emphasised his preference to proceed with the “power of the movement”, noting that the PPP was spearheading the no-confidence motion. “Gen Faiz had come to me and he asked me to go ahead [with the no-confidence vote], but only within the system, but not out of the system. Though I refused it,” he claimed.

Fazl further explained that he changed his stance once representatives from various parties approached him for a joint action. “If I had refused it again, they would say I am saving Imran.”
He insisted that all political parties were convened in the presence of the two generals, who allegedly provided directions on the matter.

The JUI-F leader alleged that Lt Gen (retd) Faiz also supported the no-confidence motion, claiming, ""Gen Bajwa and Gen Faiz gave instructions about the no-confidence motion and PML-N and PPP sealed it. Gen Faiz said that we can do everything within the limits of the system and he had no objection to it”.

Fazl's remarks have caught political analysts off guard, given his reputation as a staunch supporter of the establishment. Some speculate that his comments about Bajwa and Hameed stem from his sheer frustration over his recent defeat in general elections.

During the interview, Fazl maintained that both the 2018 and 2024 elections were rigged. ""We have decided to protest against this vote theft. Now the decisions would be taken on the ground rather than in the assembly,"" he declared.
Regarding discussions with PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif on government formation, the JUI-F chief disclosed his refusal to participate. ""I believe whatever happened during the 2024 elections, it benefitted PML-N. There are rumours that Nawaz Sharif was given the Lahore seat,"" he added.

He cautioned that if PML-N and other political parties proceed to form the government, they would be held accountable for the consequences. ""I don’t see a [bright] future for the parliament, therefore, I invited PML-N to sit with us,"" he stressed.
Fazl also expressed optimism about resolving differences with the PTI, indicating a willingness to engage in dialogue.
