Among the notable figures are Mian Aslam Iqbal, Ali Amin Gandapur and Imtiaz Sheikh, raising concerns over the administration’s ability to apprehend these accused.
Despite extensive efforts by Joint Investigations Teams (JITs) to capture the suspects, they have been evading arrest.
Notably, Gandapur has even been nominated as a candidate for the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), where PTI-backed independent candidates have secured a significant number of seats.
Furthermore, a considerable number of activists involved in the alleged violent attacks on sensitive defence installations during the May 9 incident were observed actively participating in elections campaigns.
