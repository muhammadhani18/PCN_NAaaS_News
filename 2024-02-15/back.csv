He introduced a short-term Hajj facility for the first time, marking a significant milestone in the nation's history.
Speaking at the commencement of the training session for pilgrims at Darul Hajj Haji Camp on Wednesday, the minister announced that all women participating in Hajj pilgrimage would be provided with Abayas featuring the Pakistani flag.
The minister stated that pilgrims, selected through a transparent system, were chosen via a draw, and their training had commenced on Feb 12.
He emphasized that upon taking charge of the ministry, it was firmly stated that Pakistani pilgrims would receive top-notch facilities in 2024.

1,Pakistan wants ‘strict’ IWT implementation,Ambassador Akram takes part in UNSC debate,"UNITED NATIONS: A top Pakistani diplomat on Tuesday called for “strict” implementation of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a World Bank-negotiated water-distribution agreement between India and Pakistan, as he underscored the need to address the looming water crisis.
“Increasing water demand, coupled with climate change impacts, creates the potential for trans-boundary water disputes in several parts of the world,” Ambassador Munir Akram told the UN Security Council’s high-level debate on the impact of climate change and food insecurity on international peace and security.
“Pakistan attaches high priority to the strict implementation of the Indus Waters Treaty,” the Pakistani envoy stressed in the course of the day-long debate, which was convened by Guyana, the president of the Security Council for February. Nearly 90 countries took part.
Pakistan, he added, aims to reinvigorate the Indus River basin — the largest contiguous irrigation system in the world, which provides food security to over 225 million people.
“To this end, Pakistan has launched the multi-dimensional Living Indus projects,” Ambassador Akram told the 15-member Council.
Noting that the disputes over water -- at the state, sub-national and local-community levels -- were rising, he said competing claims to agricultural and animal pastures, especially in Sub-Sahara and Central Africa, were being exploited by terrorist groups and criminal gangs.
“The scramble for exploitation of fisheries and fishing rights, and potentially for seabed minerals and resources, is causing increased friction between neighbouring coastal countries,” he pointed out.
“Addressing the looming water crisis will be critical,” Ambassador Akram added.
Extreme temperatures, he said, were melting Pakistan’s glaciers at an alarming rate, and together with heavier monsoons, lead to massive foods, like the 2022 epic floods which devastated the country, causing damage amounting to over US$ 30 billion.
“Urgent action is required to preserve the Himalayan glaciers and adapt to the impacts of global warming,” the Pakistani envoy told delegates from around the world.
When addressing climate change, securitising the issue in the development agenda must be avoided, Ambassador Akram said. The already scarce funding should not be diverted from development and climate change actions to security-related approaches.
Scarcity is the mother of most conflicts, he said, adding that the best means of conflict prevention is sustainable development, achieving the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) and the climate goals.
“Unless the commitments made at COP28 and other Conferences are implemented, ” Ambassador Akram said, “it will become almost impossible to achieve either the goals of climate change or the SDGs.”
The Security Council, he said, could make a singular contribution to both the climate and development goals – by endorsing the commitments made on climate change and sustainable development to transform these into binding obligations.
Opening the debate, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on member states to act now to break the deadly links between conflict, climate and food insecurity.
Climate chaos and food crises are serious and mounting threats to global peace and security. It is only right that they are addressed by this Council, he said. APP

6,SC demands clarity on military commerce,Notes that assets of SBCA inspectors must be investigated," 
The top court, emphasizing that all institutions of the country must stay within their constitutional boundaries, has sought assurance from the state’s top law officer that the armed forces will not engage in commercial activities.
“The military has started running marriage halls and other businesses. Make sure that it won't engage in business. The military should only focus on defense, not business,” Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa observed.
The CJ led a three-member bench also composed of Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Mussarat Hilali, which on Wednesday resumed hearing a slew of petitions filed against illegal constructions in Karachi, the country’s most populous city.
“Everyone should stay within their boundaries. The military should do its job, and the courts should do their job,” he said while addressing Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan.
The AGP agreed with the chief justice, stating that it is indeed the principle that all people must do their assigned tasks. “If you have such instructions then you should give an assurance in this regard,” the CJ added.
Earlier, the lawyer for the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) told the court that some people made forged documents of a property owned by the ETPB and sold it to a builder. “Now a five-story building stands there,” he said.
Justice Mazhar inquired about the actions of the ETPB during the construction of the building on its land.
The CJ stated that illegal constructions in Karachi could not occur without the involvement of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA).
The SBCA director-general appeared in court and informed the bench that there are a total of 1,400 employees in the SBCA, including 600 inspectors and 300 senior inspectors.
The CJ noted the need to investigate the personal assets of the SBCA inspectors and senior officers.
""It is also necessary to audit the assets of the sub-registrars in Karachi through the FBR [Federal Board of Revenue],"" he added.
The court observed that illegal buildings are being constructed in Karachi, and residential plots are being converted into commercial areas with the knowledge of the authority.
It stated that the SBCA looks away when a builder constructs an illegal building but takes action and starts demolishing such structures as soon as people buy units in these projects.
It further noted that bulldozing illegal buildings where common people have invested their money affects the rights of these residents. The court ordered that during construction, the SBCA must erect boards displaying details of the approval for that construction.
""The SBCA cannot exploit the situation for its own benefit. The SBCA should not delay issuing a certificate of building completion,"" it added. The court later adjourned for an indefinite period.

7,"PPP, PML-N to ‘collaborate for national stability’",Agree that a stable democratic government is urgently needed to tackle challenges,"The PML-N and the PPP have agreed on forming ""a stable democratic"" government to address economic, political, security, and terrorism challenges.
According to sources, this agreement was reached during a consultative meeting attended by the nominated candidates of the PML-N and the PPP in Islamabad.
Both sides presented their respective suggestions. After consultation, it was decided that another session would be held today, with the PML-N returning candidates from other provinces also participating. It was also decided that after consultation with other like-minded political parties, matters will be finalized.
In an unexpected political development, PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif emerged as a leading contender to reclaim the reins of power. His former coalition comrades – the PPP, the MQM, the PML-Q, BAP, and the IPP – once again rallied behind him.
The development came as his party chief, Nawaz Sharif, took a strategic backseat, nominating Shehbaz for the prime ministerial position and his daughter Maryam for the role of Punjab chief minister.
A powerhouse gathering at PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat's Islamabad residence saw the heads of the political parties, declaring unequivocal support for Shehbaz and pledging to address the country's issues together.
While the undertones of the press conference suggested that PPP Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari may be considered for the next presidency of the country. Earlier, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari advocated for Zardari as the next president for the nation's betterment.
The former foreign minister declared the party’s intent to abstain from holding government portfolios, although it appeared that this position would be limited to ministries and advisory roles.
