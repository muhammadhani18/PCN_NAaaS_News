0,Twin cities grapple with water scarcity,Authorities attribute shortage to annual desilting of Khanpur Dam’s left bank canal,"Annual cleaning of the Khanpur Dam's Left Bank Canal has led to a significant reduction in the daily water supply to Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
Commencing on February 12 and continuing until February 21, the extensive cleaning aims to eliminate obstructions and leaks in the 12 km long open water channel that transports water from Khanpur Dam to the Singjani Water Treatment Plant.
During this period, citizens have been urged by the Rawalpindi Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), Chaklala Cantonment boards, and the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to use water responsibly and conserve water until the cleaning process is completed.
The daily water supply from Khanpur Dam to Rawalpindi has been curtailed from 15 million gallons per day to 6 million gallons per day, while Islamabad's supply has been reduced from 7 million gallons per day to 4 million gallons per day.
WASA Managing Director Muhammad Saleem Ashraf said the joint efforts of CDA, WASA, and Cantonment boards are focused on efficiently completing the cleanup within the specified ten-day timeframe.
“The primary objective is to ensure a smooth flow of water in the canal by addressing any hindrances and leakages.”
Several areas in Rawalpindi, including Pir Wadhai, Dhok Mingtal, Dhok Hasu, Khayaban-e-Sir Syed, Shamsabad, and Double Road areas, will experience water supply suspension or reduced supply.
Residents are advised to use water judiciously during this period and store water for essential needs.
The managing director assured the public that endeavours will be made to expedite the cleaning process. “In case of emergencies, consumers are encouraged to report issues to WASA's toll-free number 1334 or the nearest complaint centre.”
Citizens have been alerted through an advisory issued by the Rawalpindi and Chaklala Cantonment boards and CDA to exercise caution in water usage during the sanitation period.
The advisory emphasized the importance of avoiding water scarcity and potential difficulties by being mindful of reduced water availability.
It is worth noting that the twin cities' water supply relies on the discharge from Khanpur Dam, Rawal Dam, and tube wells. Despite these water sources, citizens continue to face water shortages throughout the year, underscoring the necessity for coordinated efforts during routine maintenance to mitigate disruptions in the water supply system.
The water supply department of the CDA said it is working on several projects to meet the shortage of water in Islamabad so that the citizens do not face any kind of difficulties during summer.

3,Anti-dengue drive from March 1 in Rawalpindi,RMC has set up 27 clusters under new anti-dengue strategy,"The eight-month anti-dengue campaign for the new year will start from March 1 and continue till October 31. A new anti-dengue micro plan has been prepared for the campaign.
Under the plan, the training of dengue staff will begin in the third week of Feb, while 3,000 new dengue sanitary patrol workers including a good number of women, will be recruited as daily wagers.
This time, a priority will be given to Pothwari, Pashtun, Punjabi and Pahari languages speaking women so that they can continue the dengue campaign by visiting housewives in the densely populated areas of the inner city.
Under the new anti-dengue plan, the Rawalpindi district is divided into four sectors. Cluster centres consisting of two to three union councils in the city and two to three wards in Cantt have been formed. A total of 27 cluster centres have been set up and each cluster centre has an independent in-charge.
Each cluster centre will have teams of 12 to 15 women and men workers who will work from 8am to 5pm.
All those areas, from where dengue patients had appeared in the last five years, have been declared as sensitive and separate in-charges have been appointed in all these areas.
There will also be third-party survey teams, comprising three organisations, for the campaign. These teams will conduct a third-party survey of each cleared area. If dengue larvae are found during surveys, actions will be taken against the teams.
New spray pumps, modern sprays and protective kits have been ordered in large numbers for the new anti-dengue campaign. From March 1, the weeding of grass, weed and hemp will also be started in vacant plots and graveyards to prevent the spread of dengue. The Rawalpindi Metropolitan Corporation (RMC) will be responsible for cleaning cemeteries and weeding grass and hemp.

5,No relief in sight for Fawad in fraud case,Court extends ex-minister’s remand till Feb 28,"A district and sessions court in Islamabad on Wednesday postponed hearing the post-arrest bail plea of former minister Fawad Chaudhry in a road construction scam case and extended his judicial remand till February 28.
Fawad was accused of committing irregularity in Pind Dadan Khan to Jhelum Road project.
Judge Shah Rukh Arjamand, who heard the post-arrest bail plea as Judge Muhammad Bashir is on leave, adjourned the hearing till February 19.
Fawad’s lawyer Faisal Chaudhry pleaded that that court had two cases of bail and remand. His client Fawad is a Supreme Court’s lawyer and has been in jail for the past two months. The court should issue an order whether it wanted to hear the petition or not, the lawyer said.
Judge Shah Rukh remarked that whether Judge Muhammad Bashir's leave was approved on medical grounds or not, he would tell later, but he [the judge] would hear arguments on bail on Feb 19. The judge further argued that four other courts were also at his disposal.
The lawyer said that it didn’t matter whether they [the judge] had four courts or six, the court should hear his client’s plea. Fawad Chaudhry said that as general elections were over, what was stopping the court to retain him in jail.
To which, the judge remarked that the question should be asked by those who had kept Fawad in jail. He further remarked that he had signed the order sheet but couldn’t write observations.
Fawad Chaudhary said the court had signed the order sheet without the accused, a practice that is a routine in [Pakistan].
The court later adjourned hearing of the case till Feb 19 and extended Fawad’s judicial remand as of Feb 28.
Court reserves verdict
A district and sessions court in Islamabad reserved its verdict pertaining to the production of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder, Imran Khan in the case against his alleged intimidation of a female judge. 
Civil judge Mureed Abbas heard the case in Islamabad in which Khalid Yousuf Chaudhary, the counsel for Khan, maintained that his client is currently in detention by the state. 
Judge Mureed Abbas said to the council that he had first filed a petition which stated that Khan had security concerns due to which he cannot be presented. 
The lawyer argued that the concern about security persisted before the arrest, as there were serious risks then. 
The court remarked that the court may decide on the earlier petition and summon the PTI founder. The lawyer said that it is the state’s responsibility to present him now. The court reserved its order on the production request of founder PTI.

8,‘Rural support schemes reduce poverty’,NRSP chief emphasises collective responsibility to eliminate socio-economic disparities,"Speakers at a moot on Tuesday underlined the need to continue with the rural support programmes to fight rural poverty in the country.
The Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) hosted its latest ‘Thought Leaders Forum’ (TLF) under the title, “Poverty Alleviation and the Role of Rural Support Programme.”
National Rural Support Programme (NRSP) Chairman Shoaib Sultan Khan shed light on poverty alleviation and the role of rural support programmes.
He emphasised that Pakistan's rural support programmes are among the oldest in the region, are widely acknowledged for their success and have served as a model and inspiration for similar initiatives in South Asia, including India. The pursuit of poverty eradication should be a shared political agenda, serving as a unifying force rather than a source of division within regions, Sohaib added.
“It’s a common goal that has the potential to foster collaboration and solidarity across diverse geographical areas, emphasising the collective responsibility to address and eliminate socio-economic disparities.”
The NRSP chief further elucidated multiple factors that contribute to the success of such programmes including long-term political commitment, poverty eradication as a common political agenda, political support and ownership, sustained governmental support, institutional development, innovation and adaptation, and participation of women.
He brought attention to four essential elements of the success of a rural support program; (i) the willingness of the households to organise and enable their potential; (ii) a competent community leader with social mobilisation vision; (iii) professional, dedicated and committed support organisation; and (iv) availability and commitment of resources.
Dr Neelum Nigar, the Director of the Centre for Strategic Perspectives (CSP), said that under the TLF, ISSI acknowledges and pays tribute to individuals esteemed as authoritative voices in specific fields. These individuals have played a crucial role in shaping perspectives, influencing decisions, and driving innovation within their respective domains in Pakistan.
ISSI director-general Ambassador Sohail Mahmood noted that Pakistan has made significant strides in reducing absolute poverty, with rates dropping from 61.6% in 1998-99 to 21.5% in 2021-22. However, multidimensional poverty remains high at 39%, highlighting deprivation in health, education, and standard of living.
