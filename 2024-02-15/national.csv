0,ECC approves increase in gas prices,"Govt aims to recover Rs242 billion from residential, industrial consumers","The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet on Wednesday approved an increase in gas prices for residential and industrial consumers to recover an additional Rs242 billion but could not finalise rates due to the competing interests of cabinet members.
The ECC also approved the imposition of 25% sales tax on all categories of SUVs and CUVs having value of over Rs4 million, excluding taxes. The decision will give Rs4.5 billion in additional revenue to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
The matter of gas price increase is likely to land in the federal cabinet on Thursday and the Petroleum Division is in the process of working out new rates for the residential consumers and captive power plants in light of the discussions held in the ECC meeting.
February 15 is the last date to meet the International Monetary Fund (IMF) condition of increasing gas prices and to honour the commitment to raise rates for the in-house gas plants of industries.
There was uncertainty about the new gas rates for Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited (FFBQ) plant, which was availing Rs10 billion in subsidies. The finance ministry wanted to withdraw it.
The industry minister again opposed the increase in gas prices for the in-house power plants owned by industrialists by Rs750 per million British thermal units (mmbtu), or 34%. But he agreed to a nominal increase in rates.
The energy minister sought to increase rates in line with the commitments given to the IMF.
ECC Chairman and Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar stated in the meeting that gas prices should be rationalised for the fertiliser plants that were availing the subsidy being paid by bulk, power, industrial, cement and compressed natural gas (CNG) consumers.
The subsidy of Rs39 billion on feed and fuel gas for Engro Fertilisers was withdrawn and the ECC approved a new rate of Rs1,597 per mmbtu.
In a statement, the Ministry of Finance stated that a summary of the Petroleum Division titled “Natural gas sale pricing FY 2023-24, effective February 1, 2024”, was deliberated upon at length.
“After discussion, the ECC decided that the revision of sale price and tariff should be consistent with revenue requirements of Sui companies,” the ministry said.
The ECC was informed that the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) determined Rs205 billion in revenue requirement for Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC). After including taxes, consumers would be forced to cough up an additional Rs242 billion, said the sources.
The finance ministry stated that the ECC recommended a uniform gas price for fertiliser plants, a decision that should lead to the withdrawal of subsidies.
Engro was paying mere Rs200 per mmbtu on feed gas, which will now go up to Rs1,597. The Petroleum Division had proposed Rs760 per mmbtu but the finance minister got it increased to Rs1,597.
The additional amount to be collected from Engro will be used to slightly lower the proposed increase in gas prices for residential consumers. The Petroleum Division had proposed a 5% to 67% increase in gas prices for residential consumers.
New rates will be tabled before the federal cabinet on Thursday after incorporating the impact of additional revenue from the Engro plant.

The ECC directed the Competition Commission of Pakistan to investigate the undue increase in urea prices and fix responsibility. It also directed the Ministry of Industries to ensure the stability of urea prices.
However, the fertiliser sector lobby was very strong and on Wednesday again approached the finance ministry, asking it to review a day earlier decision to withdraw the subsidies.
Under an agreement with the IMF, Pakistan is required to further increase gas prices by February 15. Secretary finance told the ECC a day earlier that without price increase, the IMF would not complete the next programme review, which was necessary for the release of last tranche of $1.2 billion.
It is the third increase in gas prices that the government has proposed in the past one year.
The Petroleum Division had proposed to put the maximum burden on the most vulnerable households with 67%, or Rs100, increase per unit for monthly consumption of 0.5 cubic hectometres (HM3).
There were heated arguments on the proposal of increasing gas prices for the industrialists in the range of 18% to 34%. The Petroleum Division proposed that the existing distinction between the export and non-export industries using gas for in-house electricity generation should be abolished.
It proposed that one unified price of Rs2,950 per mmbtu may be fixed for all types of industries. This will result in an increase of Rs750 per mmbtu, or 34%, for exporters and Rs450, or 18%, for the non-export sector using gas for captive power plants.
“The textile sector cannot take an additional burden of Rs33 billion after the previous increase in gas prices put a burden of Rs110 billion,” Industries Minister Gohar Ejaz told The Express Tribune after the meeting.
He said that due to the previous increase in prices, the textile sector badly suffered, which also impacted its exports.
An official of the Petroleum Division said that due to the stiff resistance by the industries ministry, the new increase in captive gas rates would be much less than the proposed Rs2,950 per mmbtu.
Pakistan has committed to the IMF that it will make gas prices uncompetitive for the captive power plants by increasing them to the level of imported LNG prices. The imported LNG prices stand at Rs3,750 per mmbtu.
The efficiency of industrial captive plants is very low compared to LNG-fired power plants, thus, the IMF and Petroleum Division want to divert gas from industries to the power generation sector.
Only five sectors – textile, carpets, leather, sports and surgical goods – were using subsidised gas in the name of the rest of the exporters. The exporters of petrochemicals, rice, steel, ceramics, cement and glass goods were not getting the benefit.
Agritech and Fatima Fertiliser are currently getting RLNG from the SNGPL network. The proposed price for these plants will be Rs1,596 per mmbtu, which is the average prescribed price in case these plants are offered system gas on SNGPL.
These two plants are availing Rs9 billion in subsidy, which should be withdrawn instead of passed on to residential consumers.
For the CNG sector, the ECC approved increasing prices from Rs3,600 per mmbtu to Rs3,750 equivalent to the RLNG price being the fuel for the majority CNG producers.

1,Govt takes flak for seeking Rs81.5b from consumers,"DISCOs want to recover amount on account of capacity charges, T&D losses","The government has come under fire for seeking permission from the regulator for recovering Rs81.5 billion from honest consumers paying bills regularly on account of capacity charges and losses caused by theft and leakages.
Interveners called on the regulator to take strict action to fix the problem. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) held a public hearing on Wednesday to review a petition in which power distribution companies (DISCOs) sought the recovery of Rs81.5 billion from consumers under quarterly adjustment for the second quarter of financial year 2023-24.
It was informed that DISCOs wanted to collect a total of Rs75,139 million on account of capacity charges and Rs10,818 million to recover transmission and distribution (T&D) losses under the monthly fuel charges adjustment (FCA).
“Is there any end to the capacity charges that are going to rise further in future after installation of more power projects,” an intervener said during the hearing.
Capacity payments go to the power plants which remain idle and do not produce any electricity but consumers are compelled to pay due to the agreements signed by different governments with power producers on a “take-or-pay” basis.
The hearing was told that electricity consumption had decreased by 12-13% in the second quarter of FY24.
Regarding efforts to reduce circular debt, the regulator said that it was not satisfied with the measures being taken in this regard. It also expressed displeasure over the absence of senior officials of DISCOs from the public hearing.
Nepra chairman stressed that they should be present to respond to the challenges being faced by the public.
“Neither the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guarantee (CPPA-G) CEO turned up nor anyone came from the Power Division,” a member Nepra remarked and asked, “why has power consumption decreased in the country”.
The member Nepra observed that rampant load-shedding was happening in the areas of electricity companies while consumers were forced to make capacity payments.

“Electricity companies are not interested in providing new power connections,” remarked Member Nepra Rafiq Shaikh.
It was noted that electricity connections that required consumption of 1,100 megawatts had been pending but DISCOs were claiming that power consumption had dropped.
The regulator announced that it would issue a decision after the scrutiny of data.
According to the petition, DISCOs sought a total of Rs81,498 million on account of capacity charges and the impact of T&D losses on the monthly FCA.
Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco) is looking to recover Rs9,446 million, Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco) Rs2,663 million, Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) Rs3,524 million, Islamabad Electric Supply Company (Iesco) Rs6,921 million, Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) Rs15,105 million, Multan Electric Power Company (Mepco) Rs14,884 million, Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) Rs11,583 million, Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco) Rs10,983 million, Sukkur Electric Power Company (Sepco) Rs2,879 million and Tribal Electric Supply Company (Tesco) Rs3,510 million.
According to the policy guidelines issued by the federal government for the application of uniform quarterly adjustments, the FY24 second quarter adjustment for DISCOs, to be determined by Nepra, will be applicable to the consumers of K-Electric as well.
To proceed further and arrive at a just and informed decision, Nepra conducted the hearing on Tuesday.
Pursuant to the notified tariff, DISCOs filed requests for adjustments on account of capacity charges, transmission charges, market operator fee, the impact of incremental units and T&D losses on FCA, and variable operation and maintenance charges for the second quarter of FY24, October-December 2023, in line with the notified mechanism.

2,Stocks soar over prospect of coalition govt,"KSE-100 index gains 926.92 points, settles at 62,153.84","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday continued its winning streak in a spectacular rally where the KSE-100 index climbed over 900 points as investors were optimistic about the prospect of setting up a coalition government.
Earlier, the trading session kicked off with a sharp spike with the bullish activity being driven by a mutual decision of political parties, which announced plans for a coalition administration at a press conference.
Consequently, the KSE-100 index hit its intra-day high at 62,432.25. The positive sentiment was bolstered by the upbeat data on car sales, which surged 30%.
During midday trading, there was some subdued activity, which resulted in the index hitting its intra-day low at 61,635.61.
However, appreciation of the rupee against the greenback put the market back on track. The bourse maintained the bullish trend throughout the day and closed above the 62,000 mark.
“Stocks showed sharp recovery as investors weighed the decision of forming a coalition government, upbeat data on car sales that surged 30% year-on-year (YoY) in January 2024 and MSCI’s inclusion of 22 firms in the frontier market and small-cap index,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Strong earnings outlook and rupee stability played the role of catalysts in bullish close in the post-election rally at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded gains of 926.92 points, or 1.51%, and settled at 62,153.84.
Topline Securities, in its commentary, said that it was a day with some sigh of relief. “Continuing its recovery mood from Tuesday, Pakistan equities initiated business on a positive note,” it said.
“The buying momentum can be attributed to clarification regarding the formation of a new government as major political parties agreed and announced the upcoming coalition setup via press conference.”
Owing to the development, across-the-board buying was witnessed throughout the trading hours.

Resultantly, exploration and production (E&P), fertiliser, tech and oil marketing companies’ sectors contributed positively to the index as Pakistan Petroleum, Engro Corporation, Engro Fertilisers, Systems Limited and Pakistan State Oil added 343 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, noted that the recovery from sub-60,000 level continued with solid gains and the index bouncing off Tuesday’s lows.
“The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) is expected to consider revising gas prices. The IMF, in its latest country report, has stated that the government needs to raise gas tariff by Feb 15, 2024,” it said.
Hub Power reported 2QFY24 earnings per share (EPS) of Rs11.78, up 15% YoY and 1HFY24 EPS of Rs24.95, up 44%. It also declared dividend per share of Rs4 (1HFY24 – Rs9), which was below expectations.
“The rally is now shaping up to test 63,000-64,000, which is a supply zone,” AHL added.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal stated that bulls pushed the KSE-100 index up as news flow on the political and economic fronts improved market sentiment.
“We recommend investors to avail any downside as an opportunity to buy stocks in cement, tech and E&P sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 303.9 million shares against Tuesday’s tally of 435.5 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs14.7 billion.
Shares of 342 companies were traded. Of these, 267 stocks closed higher, 56 dropped and 19 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 33.4 million shares, gaining Rs0.32 to close at Rs4.47. It was followed by Oil and Gas Development Company with 32.2 million shares, losing Rs2.17 to close at Rs122.01 and Pakistan Petroleum with 15.5 million shares, gaining Rs6.1 to close at Rs107.37.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs92.8 million, according to the NCCPL.

3,Soap industry demands stop to smuggling,"Urges govt to tackle higher interest rates, call for import restrictions","The soap industry has implored the government to take stringent actions against under-invoicing and the smuggling of imported finished soap and detergent, urging the discouragement of any imports of soap, soap noodles, and detergent into the country.
Manufacturers contended that the escalating and debilitating inflation has driven up soap prices, rendering them beyond the purchasing capacity of most consumers in the local market. They also underscored the higher interest rate, a significant hindrance to the genuine growth of the entire industry. Claiming advance taxes to meet tax targets set by the Federal Board of Revenue, especially in the presence of substantial refunds, exacerbates the financial strain on the industry.
“The government should urgently and immediately undertake the following actions to address the issues faced by the soap industry: scaling down the high rate of duty on basic raw materials for soaps, curbing under-invoicing and the smuggling of imported finished soaps and detergent, ensuring maximum facilities for export, reducing skyrocketing tariffs of gas and electricity, and providing proper and required energy to the soap industry,” declared Pakistan Soap Manufacturers AssociationChairman, Syed Anwer Suhail Razvi. He highlighted that the industry contributes over Rs100 billion to the national exchequer annually while exporting goods worth $20 million each year. 
CEO of Zaki Industrial Corporation, A Abdullah Zaki, confidently stated, “The country is self-sufficient in terms of the production of all types of soaps and detergents. Currently, many units in the organised sector manufacture quality soap and detergent, successfully competing with multinational brands. Under these circumstances, there is no need to import any soap and detergent. Consequently, the import of soap, soap noodles, as well as detergent must be discouraged, while strict actions must be taken against rising smuggling and under-invoicing.”

4,‘50% increase in global LNG demand by 2040’,"Global trade in LNG reached 404 million tonnes in 2023, up from 397 million tonnes in 2022","Global demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) is estimated to rise by more than 50% by 2040. This growth is fuelled by industrial coal-to-gas switching in China, as well as South Asia and South-east Asian countries using more LNG to support their economic growth, according to Shell’s LNG Outlook 2024.
Global trade in LNG reached 404 million tonnes in 2023, up from 397 million tonnes in 2022, with tight supplies of LNG constraining growth while maintaining prices and price volatility above historic averages. While demand for natural gas has already peaked in some regions, global demand continues to rise, with LNG demand expected to reach around 625-685 million tonnes a year in 2040, according to the latest industry estimates.
“China is likely to dominate LNG demand growth this decade as its industry seeks to cut carbon emissions by switching from coal to gas,” said Steve Hill, Executive Vice President for Shell Energy. “With China’s coal-based steel sector accounting for more emissions than the total emissions of the UK, Germany and Turkey combined, gas has an essential role to play in tackling one of the world’s biggest sources of carbon emissions and local air pollution.”
Notably, over the next decade, declining domestic gas production in parts of South Asia and South-east Asia could drive a surge in demand for LNG.

5,Market gap widens to Rs2.27,Difference stretched to 0.81% after domestic currency maintained downturn in open market,"The disparity in the value of the Pakistani currency at the interbank and open markets further widened to Rs2.27 on the second consecutive working day amid political uncertainty. This fresh increase in the gap on Wednesday strengthened earlier signs of market volatility returning to the currency.
The difference stretched to 0.81% after the domestic currency maintained a downturn in open market but remained largely stable in the interbank. The gap stood at Rs1.50 some days ago, it was learnt.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, ECAP General Secretary, Zafar Paracha said, “The supply of foreign currencies has reduced at the open market as fewer people are coming to sell foreign currencies (post the general elections).”
According to ECAP, the currency dropped 0.09%, or Rs0.27 on a day-to-day basis, weakening to Rs281.59/$ in the open market. Cumulatively, the currency has dropped 0.14%, or Rs0.40 in the past two days in the retail market. In the interbank market, the domestic currency ticked down Rs0.01 on a day-to-day basis, closing at Rs279.32/$.

6,IMF loan uncertainty very high,Moody’s points to external vulnerability risks until clarity on financing plan,"Moody’s Investors Service has given a “credit negative” signal to Pakistan in the face of prolonged political ambiguity and social tensions over election results, which will make it tough to approach the IMF for a new programme, weaken external economy and make liquidity management more challenging.
In its report titled “Political uncertainty persists in Pakistan following inconclusive election results, a credit negative”, the global credit rating agency said “overall, uncertainty around Pakistan’s ability to quickly negotiate a new IMF programme after the current one expires in April 2024 remains very high. Pakistan’s government liquidity and external vulnerability risks will remain very high until there is clarity on a credible longer-term financing plan.”
It said Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves remained “very low” at $8 billion as of February 2, 2024, sufficient to cover only about six weeks of imports and well below what was required to meet external financing needs for the next three to four years.
Based on the IMF’s report published in January, Moody’s said Pakistan’s external financing needs were about $22 billion in the next fiscal year (Jul-Jun) 2024-25 and about $25 billion annually in fiscal 2026 and 2027. “The country will need a longer-term financing plan to meet its very large financing needs for the next few years, after its current IMF programme ends in April 2024.”
At present, Pakistan has been assigned a stable rating of “Caa3” by Moody’s. It said prolonged delays in the formation of a government would increase policy and political uncertainty at a time when it faced very challenging macroeconomic conditions.
People voted to elect a new government for the next five years on February 8. No political party including the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) won a majority – at least 134 out of the 266 contested seats in the centre – to form a strong government, resulting in a hung parliament.
Laws suggest the new government can be formed in the first 14 days after polls or the president may convene a session of parliament in the maximum of 21 days from the date of elections.
Read How bad is country’s debt crisis and can the IMF save it?
The caretaker government has clarified that the new government can be established any day till February 29, 2024, dismissing reports of delay in constituting the new government beyond February. The rating agency said “the inconclusive results have exacerbated political tensions amid allegations of vote rigging and tempering by PTI leading to protests in various cities. The results will also begin a complex process of parties trying to secure support from other parties in a bid to lead a coalition government.”
It said even if a combination of parties successfully formed a multiparty coalition government, the coalition may not be very united and politically strong.
The new government will face challenges in securing consensus to pursue difficult but necessary reforms, including revenue-raising measures, to improve macroeconomic conditions.
Moreover, there is also uncertainty around the extent of public protests because they may challenge the legitimacy of the new government. “Social tensions may increase, which would likely constrain the government’s ability to undertake reforms.”
The mixed election results or the alleged tempered results are against financial market expectations and pre-poll survey results, which had suggested PML-N winning majority seats to form a strong government in the centre.
In this backdrop, S&P Global Ratings, in its pre-election commentary, had hinted at upgrading Pakistan’s credit rating to “B” following the new political government came to power. It, however, linked the change in rating from the current “CCC+” with the economic roadmap from the new rulers. S&P said “Pakistan’s road to securing higher credit ratings will depend on whether the elections will bring about a government that can push for tough reforms.”
A government with popular support and the ability to work with key institutions will have a better chance of securing financing from the IMF, S&P analysts including Kim Eng Tan wrote in a February 4 report.
“Together with new policy moves to improve investor confidence and bring down inflation, this could lift fiscal and external metrics sufficiently for sovereign ratings to move to the ‘B’ rating category,” S&P added.

7,‘50% textile firms may shut down in coming weeks’,APTMA says production at these energy rates no longer feasible,"With over 50% of firms in the textiles and apparel sector at high risk of shutting down over the coming weeks, All Pakistan Textiles Mills Association (APTMA) has called upon the federal government to review the energy rates to make textile exports competitive in the international market.
The international competitiveness of Pakistan’s textiles and apparel exports is being continuously eroded by persistent surge in energy prices that are, on average, over twice those in competing countries. Moreover, electricity prices for industrial consumers are hovering at 16.7 cents/kWh and the price of gas is being increased to Rs2,950/MMBtu from Rs2,200/MMBtu at present, marking a notable increase from Rs852/MMBtu just over a year ago.
In a letter addressed to Energy Minister Muhammad Ali, APTMA, Secretary General, Shahid Sattar warned that the closure of the textiles and apparel sector will cause widespread unemployment and social unrest. “Production at these energy rates is not financially feasible and the sector’s exports have become stagnant. We’re losing market share to regional economies that have significantly lower energy tariffs like Bangladesh, India and Vietnam,” he said.
At the same time, Pakistan’s macroeconomic outlook remains weak as high inflation continues to persist, and the external sector remains vulnerable with no improvement in foreign exchange earnings. The economy is stuck in a wholly unsustainable situation in which industrial activity is shrinking with every passing day. This will have implications not just on employment and poverty but also on power sector revenue and the government’s fiscal position.
Read Textile sector faces worrying decline
Industrial power consumption has been declining since Q2FY24. Additionally, industrial contribution to the fixed costs of the power sector has also declined, necessitating an increase in the power tariffs of all other consumer categories, as reflected in the quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA) for the current quarter.
“This will likely cause even more of a decline in industrial power consumption and necessitate further increases in power tariffs for all consumers. We are stuck in a vicious cycle of declining consumption and increasing tariffs with no end in sight,” he said, adding that the industry can no longer bear the burden of paying for cross subsidies to non-productive sectors in their energy tariffs.
These cross subsidies are an economic distortion that cannot be exported and therefore significantly hinder the international competitiveness of Pakistan’s manufacturing sectors.
“A delegation of industry leaders from the textiles and apparel sector urgently requests a meeting with you to explain the precarious position the industry is in and the implications this will have on the entire economy over the coming months, and to seek your guidance on a way forward,” he said, warning that if corrective action is not taken urgently, over 50% of firms in the textiles and apparel sector are at high risk of shutting down causing widespread unemployment and social unrest.

8,FIA unearths bank fraud including counterfeiting,"Finds forensic evidence of DIB officials’ involvement in forging signatures, documents","The Federal Investigation Agency disclosed on Wednesday that a forensic report has established that officials of Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) were involved in forging documents and depriving depositors of their money – in a disclosure that brings into question the credibility of the banking system.
Additional Director General of FIA, Mujahid Akbar Khan, briefed the Senate Standing Committee on Finance on the progress of a Rs410 million fraud that DIB bank’s officials allegedly committed against a family, depriving them of their hard earnings. Senator Saleem Mandviwalla of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) chaired the meeting.
“We have received the forensic report, which established that the bank’s staff forged the signatures and withdrew money from their accounts,” said the additional director-general in testimony before the standing committee.
Akbar said that the FIA has decided to register a First Investigation Report (FIR) against the staff of DIB, saying there was negligence on the part of the bank.
This is the second fraud with depositors to have surfaced in recent months and come to the level of the Senate Standing Committee after the banks’ management found protecting their employees instead of taking action against them. Earlier, a similar fraud was reported in another bank.
Justice must be done, and the FIA should investigate DIB officials, said Senator Farooq H Naeek, the former Law Minister and member of the committee.
The additional director-general further said that the FIA was now in possession of “physical evidence of the forgery and about the involvement of the three officials of the bank”. He said that there was evidence of the issuance of fake cheque books, parallel banking, and encashment of fake cheques.
At least seven to 10 employees of the banks are involved in the fraud who issued nine fake cheque books to withdraw money from the accounts, Nazhat Butt, one of the affected depositors, told the standing committee.

She said that the bank’s employees started unauthorised cash withdrawals in 2017 which continued for seven years – the period in which she was residing abroad. “In a single day, Rs10.3 million was illegally withdrawn from my account,” said Butt.
Acting CEO of Dubai Islamic Bank, Syed Farhan Ali, told the committee that the bank found the concerned branch manager’s behaviour suspicious in 2022 and subsequently fired him. He said that there were suspicious transactions valuing Rs20.5 million, and the amount was subsequently paid to the depositors.
The acting CEO did not deny the existence of the fraud but said that it was a complicated case. Ali said that the bank received the claim of Rs410 million in 2023, about a year and a half after making the Rs20.5 million payments.
The committee did not accept the CEO’s view and said that the fraud began in 2017, and the bank took action in 2022, that too not to the satisfaction of the victims.
The Additional Director-General of FIA reported that certain documents related to the case were sent for forensic examination, and it was discovered that forgery had been committed through the use of fake signatures and cheques.
The Committee directed the acting CEO of Dubai Islamic Bank to cooperate fully with the FIA. Additionally, the Committee requested a fact-finding report on the issue to be presented in the next meeting on February 21, 2024.
Fahad Butt and his family, who were the victims of the alleged fraud, attended the committee meeting and provided evidence of the alleged wrongdoing.
The FIA is substantiating the victim’s claim. If it is Dubai Islamic Bank, should we sell our sovereignty and let it swindle the depositors, questioned Senator Farooq Naeek.

The pipeline project, an initiative of the Petroleum Division and the SIFC, aims to complement the oil pipeline backbone from Karachi to Peshawar. Additionally, it aims to facilitate the energy-efficient movement of petroleum products as well as prevent adulteration and provide increased safety. The pipeline will connect Punjab from Machike, near Lahore, to Tarujabba, near Peshawar.
The pipeline consists of two segments: Machike-Thallian and Thallian - Tarujabba along Motorway with connectivity options with Attock refinery, Chakpirana and Faqirabad. It completes the infrastructure supply chain from Karachi to Peshawar. This may be called a flagship project spearheaded by FWO and jointly supported by PSO and ISGS. The 477 km long pipeline, aims at ensuring a smooth supply chain of petroleum products from Karachi to Peshawar with initial carrying capacity of 7 MTPA extendable to 10 MTPA.
(Amended press release is available on Petroleum Division's, PID and APP website.)
