1,Porn addicts are lured into spreading blasphemy: official,FIA cyber wing deputy director says some sites offer more explicit content for sharing blasphemous content,"Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Cyber Wing Deputy Director Mahmudul Hasan revealed that individuals visiting pornographic websites are often coerced into sharing blasphemous content online.
Has made this shocking revelation while addressing the awareness session on ‘Blasphemous Material: Misuse of Social Media’ organised by the Students’ Advisor of the University of Karachi at the Chinese Teachers’ Memorial Auditorium. 
Hasan emphasized that individuals found guilty under Pakistan’s 295c Law, which carries a maximum punishment of the death penalty, face dire consequences in both this life and the hereafter. He noted that Pakistan ranks among the highest in the world for viewing pornographic websites and sharing child pornography. 
Hasan explained that those visiting such sites are manipulated into sharing blasphemous content after becoming addicted to obscenity, thus serving as unwitting conduits for spreading offensive material in exchange for access to more explicit content.
The deputy director of the FIA Cyber Wing informed the audience that they had arrested 344 people aged between 15 and 35 years. Last year, seven people were sentenced to death for uploading and sharing insulting content, and the remaining 242 cases are in the final stages.
Meanwhile, University of Karachi Vice Chancellor Professor Dr. Khalid Mahmood Iraqi reiterated the sanctity of reverence for the Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) and emphasised the necessity of halting the dissemination of blasphemous material under the guise of modernism. Dr Iraqi acknowledged that blasphemy laws are sometimes misused, leading to debates within the country.
Earlier, PTA Islamabad Web Analytics Division Director Muhammad Farooq said in the last six months, Facebook has removed 14.8 million content based on bullying and harassment and 28.7 million content based on hate speech.
Farooq stressed that, “it is necessary to educate our youth to protect them from the negative use of social media.”
A member of the Islamic Ideological Council, and a KU faculty member Dr Umair Mehmood Siddiqui said that people who have been watching pornographic content for three or four years are found involved in following, spreading, and sharing insulting content, “which is very alarming for our society.”
He informed the audience that the United States hosts 60 per cent of porn websites, while Pakistan is number one in the search of porn sites on Google, which is very shameful and a serious concern for all of us.
The KU Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences Dean Professor Dr Shaista Tabsum emphasised promoting awareness for the positive use of social media and the internet in Pakistan and said that we all need to play our role in this regard.
Ziauddin University Karachi Human Rights Center Director Dr Muaz Shah shed light on the laws in Pakistan regarding misuse of social media and promotion of offensive content. The KU Associate Professor of the Department of Islamic History Dr Muhammad Sohail Shafiq, and the KU Students’ Advisor Dr Nosheen Raza also spoke on this occasion.

2,"50 years on, man continues to fight to get his plot",SHC judge calls Karachi 'haven for criminals',"Despite the passage of 50 years, a senior citizen's plot dispute remains unresolved, prompting Justice Salahuddin Panhwar of the Sindh High Court (SHC) to comment on the city's status as a ""haven for criminals."" 
A two-judge bench, headed by Justice Panhwar, then ordered an inquiry into the case, specifically focusing on missing documents from the subordinate civil case. 
Appearing before the bench, the counsel for the petitioner, Advocate Riyaz Alam, argued before the bench that the alternative plot provided by the Karachi Development Authority (KDA) lacked welfare facilities and was a breeding ground for criminal activity. 
Advocate Alam told the bench that Mansoor Latifi's father had purchased a 1,000-yard plot in the Korangi Industrial Area in 1975, but it got occupied by squatters. The current market value of a 1,000 square yard plot in KIA is between Rs150 million to Rs200 million.
Following a civil case at the subordinate court over the ages, the KDA was ordered to allocate a plot to the petitioner in Surjani Town. However, due to criminal activities in the area, the petitioner requested the KDA for an alternative location.
Justice Panhwar highlighted the city's overall crime situation, stating that Karachi, home to thousands of criminals, including target killers, poses challenges for its residents. The court ordered an inquiry into the missing documents from the civil case.

3,Lobbying underway for Sindh’s incoming govt,Influential members of the PPP are moving at a brisk pace to pick the new Chief Minister and his or her cabinet,"The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) is all set to form another government in Sindh, after nearly sweeping the entire province electorally on day of the general election, which resulted in a thumping majority for the party. 
With this huge win under its belt, the PPP’s leadership now faces the seemingly tough task of which individuals from the party gets to head the province and who will accompany the individual as part of the provincial cabinet. In this regard, Senator Taj Haider, in an exclusive telephonic conversation with the Express Tribune, after attending the PPP’s Central Executive Committee meeting held in Islamabad, informed that the party had not taken any decisions as of yet. “PPP has not made any decision regarding who will be in government in Sindh. This decision will be taken after the ongoing consultation process regarding formation of government in the centre is complete,” said the Senator. 
Nevertheless, as per multiple sources within the PPP, who spoke with the Express Tribune under the condition of anonymity, influential people with the party are active in Sindh for the formation of a government in the province and are actively lobbying for the future Chief Minister of Sindh and his or her provincial cabinet. Moreover, the Express Tribune learnt that in this regard once particular lobby, which has successfully placed 7 out of 12 people in the top slot of the province is highly active and former chief minister Syed Murad Ali Shah’s name is gaining prominence. 
As far as the provincial cabinet is concerned, party insides informed that if Syed Murad Ali Shah becomes the Chief Minister again, there will be some old faces in his cabinet, like Sharjeel Inam Memon, Syed Sardar Shah, Mukesh Kumar Chawla, Azra Fazal Pechuho, and Sajid Jokhio. However, the Express Tribune was told that efforts will also be made to give a share to members of influential political families who joined the party prior to the general election, such as the Mehar Family of Shikarpur and the Mehar Sardars of Ghotki.  
In this regard, senior political analyst, Qazi Asif, was of the view that those who joined PPP recently will definitely demand inclusion in the provincial cabinet but might be subjected to constitutional restrictions. “According to the 18th amendment to the country’s constitution, the provincial government cannot have more than 11 per cent of the total members of the assembly as ministers. This means that Sindh’s cabinet can have a maximum of 18 ministers,” explained Asif. 
Sources within the PPP are aware of the constitutional bar; nevertheless informed the Express Tribune that the Chief Minister had the power to appoint assistants and special assistants apart from ministers, so other aspirants would likely be adjusted in such positions. 
Be that as it may, some political observers feel that the PPP’s priority should not be to keep political families and Members of the Sindh Assembly happy because the people have voted for it to solve their problems and thus welfare of the people should be its first priority.
In this regard, Sohail Sangi, opined that the incoming PPP government will have to pay special attention to ministries such as transport and public health this time. “It is crucial to solve the problems of drinking water and sewage and public health in the province, therefore, the PPP has to give more importance to these ministers. Similarly, the transport ministry will also need special attention because transport is one of the major problems in many cities of Sindh including Karachi,” asserted Sangi while talking to The Express Tribune.

4,Facial recognition system at airport remains ineffective,"Despite the system being operational for several months, the operation room remained closed","The modern facial recognition system, a collaborative effort between Karachi airport and the government of Japan, is facing operational challenges due to incomplete data entry, rendering it ineffective.
Sources reveal that the state-of-the-art system, installed at the Jinnah International Terminal with Japanese cooperation, is not fully realising its potential in identifying wanted suspects. One major issue contributing to this limitation is the inadequate entry of data concerning individuals sought by law enforcement agencies, including police. Another hurdle is the shortage of manpower within the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), impacting the optimal functioning of the system.
Donated by Japan a few years ago, the system comprises modern cameras strategically placed at entry gates and various sections of the international departure lounge. These cameras are designed to identify wanted suspects and criminals upon their entry into the terminal, utilising stored images in the Facial Recognition System (FRS). Once identified by the duty officer in the monitoring room, suspects can be detained.
Despite the system being operational for several months, the operation room remained closed.

5,SHC orders release of funds to tackle stray dogs issue,Also orders reinstatement of the dedicated helpline 1093,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has ordered the Sindh government to release funds for tackling the issue of stray dogs and to reinstate the dedicated helpline 1093. This decision was given on a petition against the increasing stray dog population in the city and the inadequate supply of dog-bite vaccines to hospitals.
A bench headed by SHC Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi took up the petition, which focused on controlling the increasing number of stray dogs and the insufficient availability of vaccines. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) lawyer informed the court that the orders had been executed, and a comprehensive report had been submitted.
The project director of the Anti-Rabies Program appeared before the court, elaborating on the measures taken. The court questioned the steps to be implemented and those already in implementation stage. The project director explained that anti-rabies vaccinations were being administered to stray dogs across the province.
Chief Justice Abbasi remarked on the visible presence of at least 50 dogs in the SHC premises. He emphasised the lack of observable actions to address the issue. The project director responded, stating that legislative measures had been undertaken, and three centres were established for sterilisation and vaccination in South, East, and Malir districts.
Chief Justice Abbasi pointed out the need for practical steps, questioning whether any efforts were made to catch stray dogs in the SHC premises. The project director assured that teams had been dispatched to South, Central, and Gulshan-e-Maymar for action against stray dogs, citing a shortage of funds.
The chief justice directed his inquiry to the public prosecutor, questioning the delay in fund release. The court ordered the restoration of helpline 1093, dedicated to action against dogs, and urged the Sindh government to promptly release funds for addressing the stray dog issue. The court also ordered the continuation of efforts to control the stray dog population.

The speaker advised those alleging rigging to approach the Election Tribunal with evidence regarding their complaints and if their complaints are found to be valid, they will surely get justice. 
When asked about the sit-ins of various political parties against the alleged rigging, he said that road blocking causes inconvenience to the citizens. 
In response to a question, he said that if GDA chief Pir Pagara wants to do road politics, he is welcome to fulfill this desire and then there will be the time when we would do something. 
He said that PPP would run the proceedings of the Sindh Assembly without being influenced by anyone. He said, unless a member of the assembly takes the oath, he is not considered a member of the assembly. 
Durrani said that he does not know if the Election Commission has selected the candidates.
