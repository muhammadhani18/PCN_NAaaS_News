0,X becomes govt's first target,Experts term social media blackout an attempt to impede free flow of information,"Social media giant X, formerly Twitter, often becomes the first casualty when the government fails to handle criticism in Pakistan.
Once again, amid political, economic and security challenges coupled with rigging allegations arising out of February 8 elections, the government’s fear of dissent forced it to take X as a threat and shut it down without giving any reasons.
It’s not the only one, as other social media applications, cellular services and internet frequently face blackout, leaving from the president to experts and media to common man to question the unannounced disruption and dub it an attempt to silent dissent.
“The blockage of social media websites in Pakistan was due to the lack of intellectual capacity to handle criticism,” President Dr Arif Alvi said on Monday in remarks, which came on the heels of X’s nation-wide disruption for the last three days as noted by Netblocks — a global internet monitor.
The more insulting moment was when the caretaker IT Minister Umar Saif, while apparently using a proxy service – VPN – proudly posted on X that “Pakistan’s IT industry is taking off…” when X was down in Pakistan.
“It appears that the caretaker government intends to limit free flow of information regarding the 2024 elections,” said Jibran Nasir, a renowned lawyer and civil rights activist. “And by doing so [it] is making the election results more controversial than they already are.”
Nighat Dad, a lawyer and the executive director of the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF), said that suspending any social media platform was against the fundamental rights enshrined in Article 19 [about freedom of speech, etc] and 19-A [about right to information] of the Constitution.
Also, the eminent expert said, hindering and violating access to any platform or access to information was against the international commitments, especially the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the international human rights frameworks.
“What is more worrying is that there is complete silence and lack of transparency by the regulator,” Dad said, adding that it was unclear what laws or frameworks were the authorities concerned following to suspend X or other social media platforms. “Disruption sends a message of uncertainty,” she added.
While listing down the possible reasons behind the government’s decision to black out X and other apps, Dad said that the purpose was to curtail certain speeches, suppress voices and stop people from discussing and debating “rigging”.
Dad emphasised that security threats and massive disinformation at a time when people were charged and biased and ready to believe anything, including AI or synthetic media content, could be other reasons to block a social media site(s).
However, she said, the solution was not to completely shut down an app or the social media site, stressing that the access could be limited due to security threats in certain areas.
“But it’s like two truths and a lie kind of situation,” she said as it’s not just the rights but businesses, riding apps and free lancers, among others, who were affected but the negative message that it sent to international community. “It hurts business and investments as well,” she said.
Sharing views with The Express Tribune, IT and AI Strategist and Consultant Khawaja Fahad Shakeel said that disrupting X had technical, social and economic implications for the country. “It is used to make trends like the 2024 general elections, former Rawalpindi Commissioner Liquat Ali Chatha and the like.
On top of that, Shakeel said, the international media and watchdogs kept monitoring and measuring trends through the parameters like social media apps, used by all bigwigs and political parties. “If it is blocked, they stops making trends and the rankings fall significantly.”
He said common people are unaware of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), stressing that around 2 or 3% of the total internet users in Pakistan knew how to use VPNs to operate the social media platform. “When people have no access to information,” Shakeel said, “it impacts negatively.”
IT sector is divided into four industries—call center industry, SEO [Search Engine Optimisation] marketing industry, software development industry and social media industry, Shakeel said, adding the IT companies had to move to Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn to market their brands, when X was down.
Economic analyst and Alpha Beta Core CEO Khurram Schehzad said that the marketing agencies took full advantage of all social medial platforms and if even one app was down, it hurt businesses and image of the country.
“The social media are way more powerful these days, if it is blocked, it negatively impacts people, including investors, companies and foreigners.”

1,IHC tasks spymasters with missing persons recovery,Court expresses displeasure at absence of PM,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) formed a committee comprising heads of three top spy agencies of the country on the issue of missing Baloch students, and once again summoned the caretaker prime minister on February 28.
The committee comprised directors general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the Military Intelligence (MI) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB). The court said that regardless of political government, the committee would provide answers regarding the missing persons.
IHC Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani took up the matter for hearing.
Expressing concern over the non-recovery of the missing Baloch students and the absence of the prime minister, the court once again summoned the caretaker premier for February 28.
Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan cited the caretaker prime minister's unavailability due to engagements in Karachi. Justice Kayani emphasised the importance of accountability, stating that appearing in court was not a matter of insult for the prime minister; rather, he was answerable.
The court said that a committee was being formed of the same agencies, which had been facing allegations relating to the missing persons issue. It added that regardless of the government, or the new government, this committee would provide the answers.
Additionally, the court announced stringent measures, stating that in any future cases of disappearance from within Islamabad's jurisdiction, a case would be filed against the Inspector General (IG) of police, interior secretary, and the in-charge of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD).
Attorney General Awan informed the court that eight students were still missing. The judge said that the prime minister was called because he was answerable to the court. He added that here nobody was above the law.
The court expressed dismay over the failure in the recovery of all missing individuals even after the lapse of two years. Whether institutions were responsible for their disappearance; or they ran away on their own, or they were kidnapped, in either case it was the failure of the state institutions, he added.
The attorney general requested the court for some time so that the new government could make a policy. The court said that three governments in the past had not been able to do anything to recover the missing Baloch students.
Iman Mazari Advocate said that during the last few months more students were forcibly disappeared, stressing that the change of government would not help. Justice Kayani said that the committee had been formed which would give answers, regardless of which government was in office.
The judge said that some institutions had been granted exemptions, which should not be given to them. He warned that the deputy commissioner of Islamabad misused Maintenance of Public Order (MPO)and now, after the court decision, he was facing the contempt case.
Lawyer Sher Afzal Marwat told the court that his house was raided at 2am by those who were wearing police uniforms and masks.
Justice Kayani said that Marwat was a member of the National Assembly (MNA) as well as a lawyer. If this could happen to an assembly member here in Islamabad, imagine, what could be happening to the common people in Balochistan. If the state institutions did this, who would protect the citizens from thieves and robbers, he asked.
In a stark warning to the official, the judge said that they should be afraid of the time when someone stood up against the law enforcement personnel and shoot them in resistance.
The court then summoned the caretaker prime minister and adjourned the hearing till February 28.

2,Senators seek treason proceedings against CEC,Political parties join forces against CEC for playing fast and loose with Constitution,"Political heavyweights in the Senate on Tuesday joined forces to condemn what they claimed to be blatant rigging in the Feb 8 general elections, firing shots at the chief election commissioner for playing fast and loose with the Constitution, committing treason, while demanding action under Article 6 – high treason.
The Jamaat-e-Islami and the Awami National Party accused CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja of violating the Constitution and committing treason.
The PTI, on the other front, proposed a judicial investigation into the election results and an audit of Form-45.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) suggested pursuing legal action against political parties allegedly tampering with the election results.
The PML-N advised fellow political actors to roll up their sleeves and play their role in the parliamentary arena.
However, the JUI-F, ANP, and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party flatly rejected the election results.
Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani presided over the Senate meeting during which the Leader of the Opposition, Waseem Shehzad, presented a motion to suspend the question period, which was approved.
Subsequently, discussions on the general elections of 2024 commenced in the Senate.

‘Bullet hijacked ballot’
During the Senate session, JI Senator Mushtaq Ahmed called for the prosecution of the CEC, alleging a violation of the Constitution and treason.
He accused the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of not conducting transparent elections, asserting that action should be taken against the CEC under Article 6 for violating the Constitution.
Mushtaq expressed concern that the election had exacerbated the country's economic and political crisis, labelling those who were involved in rigging as national criminals.
He contended that the “ballot has been hijacked by bullets during the election”.
He expressed regret that a handful of government officials clandestinely deprived the people of their rights, adding that the CEC ought to issue an apology and a sum of Rs50 billion should be reclaimed from him.
To ensure a transparent examination of the election, it is imperative to establish a judicial commission, he asserted.
He lamented that despite attaining freedom from the British, “certain government servants” were choosing to subjugate the masses in “secret meetings”.
The alarms over the Feb 8 polls – marred by rigging allegations from the start – were raised in the upper house after former Rawalpindi commissioner Liaqat Ali Chattha dropped a bombshell, accusing the ECP and Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa of involvement in rigging—a claim denied by both the electoral watchdog and the top judge.
Senator Mushtaq, addressing the Senate, criticised the elections held on Feb 8 as the worst-ever rigging, asserting that any government formed based on those polls would be considered fake.
He demanded an apology from the ECP for failing to fulfil its constitutional responsibility and called for the resignation of the CEC.
Mushtaq urged the initiation of proceedings under Article 6 of the Constitution and the recovery of the Rs5 billion spent on the elections from those who were responsible for rigging.
Accusing four departments—the ECP, caretaker government, judiciary and establishment—of “stealing the public mandate”, Mushtaq insisted that the ECP should be tried for high treason.
He lamented the increase in the costs of essential services, attributing it to the money allegedly given to the ECP.
Mushtaq further questioned the credibility of the Feb 8 polls, pointing out the suspension of mobile and internet services on election day.
He criticised the clampdown on social media, alleging it was to suppress the evidence of rigging.
Referring to Chattha's news conference, Mushtaq claimed that it had exposed irregularities in the Feb 8 elections.
The senator commended JI Karachi Amir Naeemur Rehman for forfeiting his Sindh Assembly seat and raised concerns about pre-made deals influencing election results.
He said that the alleged poll rigging was jeopardising Pakistan's future, turning elections meant to resolve crises into sources of economic and political challenges.
Mushtaq questioned the transparency of decision-making behind closed doors by civil servants and its impact on the public.
Vote revolution
PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar emphasised that the Pakistani people, especially the youth, unequivocally expressed their support for imprisoned party leader Imran Khan on Feb 8.
""It signifies a vote revolution and a commitment to democracy,"" he stated. ""Despite instances of both pre- and post-poll rigging, the decision is resounding. Whether acknowledged or not, this choice stands in favour of hope and democracy, supporting the PTI and Imran Khan.""
He recounted the challenges faced by the PTI, including harassment with the anticipation that the supporters wouldn't turn out to vote.
Zafar highlighted raids on the homes of the PTI candidates, obstructions in filing nomination papers, and the prevention of party gatherings leading up to the polls.
He lamented the last-minute snatching of the party's symbol to create confusion among voters, labelling these events as ""pre-poll rigging"".
Barrister Zafar criticised the timing of Imran's convictions in various cases just days before the polls, referring to it as a ""witch hunt"", and warned of the adverse effects on the country's politics.
“Despite all this, the nation came out and voted for the PTI on Feb 8. But when pre-poll rigging failed, post-poll rigging began. Our mandate has been stolen and if it is not returned, then it will not stay in anyone’s hands.
“A government without legitimacy and mandate will only fail,” he added.
Meanwhile, PTI Senator Walid Iqbal noted that the word “election” in Pakistan’s Constitution meant that it was not the mere casting or counting of votes but was rather “an entire process”.
“But whatever happened throughout this process — which includes snatching of nomination papers, depriving a party of its electoral symbol, and raids — proves that the electoral process was tainted,” he claimed.
He lamented the suspension of mobile and internet services, saying that the outage was condemned across the world.
“The caretakers and the ECP will have to prove that there was no malice in this suspension,” the senator demanded.
Iqbal highlighted that the CEC had assured the nation that provisional results, on the basis of Form-45, would be announced by midnight.
“But this did not happen, everything is in front of us,” he pointed out.
Meanwhile, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui acknowledged the imperfections in Pakistan's electoral history, noting that this issue had persisted for several decades.
He pointed out that none of the democratically elected governments had been allowed to complete their tenure.
""I agree with my colleagues that the history of our elections is far from perfect. However, why are we not discussing the 2018 polls?"" the senator questioned. ""The events in the 2018 general elections constitute a dark chapter in our country's history. Much transpired back then, and perhaps similar events occurred this year as well. If so, it wasn't limited to Punjab or Balochistan; it occurred in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa too.""
Senator Siddiqui emphasised that the irregularities were widespread.
""If you experienced it, so did we,"" Siddiqui underscored.
In the meeting, Barrister Zafar introduced a resolution in the Senate calling for the issuance of a production order for PTI Senator Ijaz Chaudhry.
The resolution received signatures from 24 members representing various political parties.
Subsequently, as the caretaker minister for human rights prepared to conclude the ongoing debate regarding alleged election rigging, PML-N’s Senator Sadia Abbasi objected and pointed out the quorum.
In response, the Senate meeting was adjourned and postponed until 10:30 on Friday morning.

3,PTI-backed MPs swell SIC ranks,Hafiz Hamid extends ‘unconditional support’ to PTI,"The dust of controversy-marred elections on Feb 8 finally seemed to settle to some extent as the PTI, in its efforts to form a government, announced on Monday that its independent candidates, who emerged victorious in the Centre, Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa would join the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).
“Our candidates have submitted their affidavits with us and with their consent, today we are announcing that PTI-backed independents are joining the Sunni Ittehad Council,” PTI leader Barrister Gohar said while addressing a news conference in the federal capital.
He was flanked by the party’s chief organiser and nominee for premiership Omar Ayub Khan, Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan, SIC Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza and Majlis Wahadat-e-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas.
Gohar observed that the PTI-backed independent candidates had emerged victorious in all the provinces, with more than 30 million ballots cast in the party’s favour. “We claim that the PTI has won 180 National Assembly seats. Our candidates will join Sunni Ittehad Council in national, Punjab and Khyber-Pakhunkhwa assemblies,” he said.
Gohar elaborated that the PTI had reached a ""formal agreement"" with SIC, noting that the step had been taken to protect the reserved seats. ""There are 70 reserved seats in the National Assembly and 227 reserved seats in the country, and these seats are only provided to political parties,"" he said.
“Hence, to protect our reserved seats and provide cover to our members, we have reached a formal agreement under which all our candidates have joined the SIC and we will present this documentation before the ECP.”
Parties are allocated 70 reserved seats - 60 for women, 10 for non-Muslims - in proportion to the number of seats won. This completes the National Assembly's total 336 seats. Independents are not eligible for reserved seats.
He added that a request would be submitted to the ECP to allocate the reserved seats according to the party's strength.
Gohar stressed that Form 47 should have been made in accordance with Form 45. Forms 45 and 47 are the official documentation of the election results.
After voting is completed and ballots are counted at a polling station, the presiding officer fills out Form 45 and submits it to the returning officer of the constituency. The returning officer then gathers and tallies results from Form 45 from every polling station in the constituency to determine the final results.
Meanwhile, prior to official confirmation of final results, Form 47 documents the unconfirmed results in a constituency. This includes the number of votes polled in the constituency, a candidate-wise breakdown of votes, and the number of votes cancelled or rejected. Form 47 is prepared by tallying results obtained from Form 45s.
On election night, reports surfaced that candidates and their representatives were being denied Form 45 by the presiding officers with the PTI expressing concerns over the “non-provision of Form 45” to its polling agents.
Gohar said PTI’s seven to eight seats from Peshawar were rigged by the deputy commissioner and others, demanding that the “engineering in polls” be investigated as it was a matter of public mandate.
He said JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman was with the PTI in their struggle against rigging in polls.
Referring to PTI founder Imran Khan, Gohar stated that the decision about the return of turncoats to the party could only be taken by prisoner number 804.
Independents join SIC
As the development unfolded, 50 of the 93 successful PTI-backed independent candidates who won the National Assembly seats in the general elections officially joined the SIC and submitted the party certificate along with affidavits to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
The SIC chairman sent a letter to the polls supervisory body, urging it to issue a notification in this regard.
Meanwhile, over 60 triumphant independent candidates from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have officially become members of the SIC. The recently elected assembly members have submitted their affidavits to the designated chief minister.
The PTI fell short of securing a hat-trick in forming the government for the third consecutive term in the province. As per official records, the SIC will be at the helm of the provincial government, not the PTI.

4,"PML-N, PPP fail to break logjam",Both parties will meet again today," The fifth round of talks between the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) ended without leading to a breakthrough on points of contention, leaving the formation of government at the Centre delayed for at least another day, it emerged on Tuesday.
The formation of a central government is hanging in the balance as the PML-N is delaying decision on the proposals forwarded by the PPPP.
The inter-party meetings between the two sides are being held to decide the terms and conditions of a possible alliance at the Centre.
So far, both sides have failed to reach any conclusion and the matter has now been delayed till Tuesday (today).
In talks, the PPPP has been demanding that the office of the president should be given to it along with the Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker seats.
In response, the PPPP while announcing that it will not take any portfolios will support the PML-N’s candidate for the premiership.
The PML-N, however, has not yet responded to the PPPP’s demands. However, it wants the PPPP to join the federal cabinet and take ownership of the decisions instead of just simply sitting on the treasury benches as silent spectators.
On Monday, both sides met behind closed doors and continued deliberating on pending issues for over three hours.
Both the sides are expected to meet again on Tuesday. The meeting, held at the residence of senior PML-N leader Senator Ishaq Dar at the Parliament Lodges in Islamabad, saw the participation of prominent figures from both the parties.
The PPP delegation comprised Murad Ali Shah, Qamar Zaman Kaira, Nadeem Afzal Chan and others.
Meanwhile, the PML-N leadership met with the leaders of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) to seek their support for the formation of the federal government.
In a statement, the MQM-P spokesperson said that the party has sought a pledge from the PML-N on its three-point constitutional amendments to join the government.
The MQM-P’s three constitutional amendments deal with local government autonomy.
In its manifesto, the party has shared the draft of the bill as well. It stated that it is imperative that in order to instill a truly representative and participatory democracy quintessentially, the local governments at grass root levels, throughout the country, are to be empowered politically, financially, and administratively, so that the fruits of democracy are extended for the benefit of the populace.
In the meeting on Monday, discussions on other issues, including creating a common strategy to deal with the challenges being faced, were discussed. Various other issues focusing on how to get the people of Pakistan, especially Sindh, out of the mire of problems were deliberated upon.

The party statement said that it is the responsibility of all the parties to solve the problems faced by the country and to get out of the crises.
“Giving constitutional protection to the devolution of powers and resources at the grassroots level is the top priority of MQM Pakistan,” the spokesperson said.
He said that the leaders of both the parties agreed to continue talks and meetings regarding the government formation.
Following the PML-N and the MQM-P meeting, Sindh governor and MQM-P leader Kamran Tessori engaged in an informal dialogue with journalists, reiterating the parties’ unified stance in navigating the complexities of government formation.
Reportedly, Tessori affirmed, “We stand united in the challenging task of government formation. The MQM-P has assured full support, and we anticipate the issuance of an official declaration later today.”
Despite multiple rounds of talks, a decision regarding the PPP’s inclusion in the cabinet remained elusive. Optimism, however, persists within the PML-N circles, with sources expressing confidence that an agreement with the PPP will be reached soon.
Speaking informally to reporters after the meeting, PML-N leader Azam Nazir Tarar conveyed a positive trajectory in the ongoing discussions, asserting that talks with the PPP committee would resume the next morning.
He hinted at predetermined aspects concerning the PPPP’s integration into the federal cabinet.
