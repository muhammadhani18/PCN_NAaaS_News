1,Out of city attendants face tough ordeal,Government should provide facilities for patients and their relatives coming from far flung areas in public hospitals,"Due to a dearth of modern treatment facilities in interior Sindh and Balochistan, residents of the two areas often have to make their way to Karachi for medical attention but the lack of affordable accommodation facilities in the city is a hassle for family and friends accompanying the patients.
One such relative of a patient is Muhammad Faqir Khaskheli, who was laying on a footpath inside Jinnah Hospital. Khaskheli, who hails from Thatta, accompanied his brother to the public hospital for treatment along with two women of the family. “We do not have enough money to rent a hotel. All the money we had is being spent on our brother’s treatment. Therefore, we have to spend the night on the footpaths,” bemoaned Khaskheli.
Likewise, Zubaydah, who hails from Hub, also has to spend the night under Karachi’s sky due to lack of accommodation options inside the hospital and exorbitantly priced hotels outside. “I have brought my daughter here, who has a complicated disease. It is unfortunate that there are no accommodation options for the poor,” lamented Zubaydah, who further added that toilets and privacy were her biggest concerns.

“However, I have no choice. I want my daughter to recover,” an upset Zubaydah informed.
Sumaira, who was sitting outside the National Institute of Heart Diseases and Burns Center, related to Zubaydah’s plight. “Our mother has to undergo a heart surgery therefore we brought her here from Khairpur,” she explained, “we do not even have the money to fund the surgery, which is being done through the Zakat fund, therefore, we have to make do by sleeping out in the open.”
“The government should provide some facilities for patients and their relatives coming from far flung areas in public hospitals. No one can afford to pay for medical treatment, accommodation, and food together,” she implored.
Shakeel Dehlvi, an activist who provides social services in hospitals, understands Sumaira’s situation. “The biggest problem with the families of patients visiting Karachi’s hospitals from far flung areas is that they do not have accommodation and food facilities here. Patients and their families are forced to incur costs of the medical treatment and their living in Karachi,” remarked Dehlvi.
In this regard, a spokesman for the Jinnah Hospital, informed that they were aware that accommodation was an issue for attendants of patients. “Presently we do not have any accommodation facility for attendants but in the near future accommodation will be arranged for female attendants of out of city patients,” he assured.
The Spokesman of the Department of Health and Social Welfare, also gave a similar assurance when asked about the plight of out of city attendants for patients. “The Sindh government is trying to provide more facilities for the caregivers of such patients on its own and with the support of social institutions,” the Spokesman informed while talking to The Express Tribune.

She informed the seminar that another study shows that about 57 per cent of working women face harassment at workplace. According to her, this is a reported figure and there are chances that more females experience the same problem.

7,PTI-independents say ROs made MQM win,The allegations put forth by PTI nominees underscore the need for transparent and fair electoral practices,"Independent candidates fielded by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in Hyderabad, including Dr Mustansar Billah and Naeemuddin, have come forward asserting PTI’s sweeping victory not only in Hyderabad but across the nation.
Speaking at a joint press conference held at the Hyderabad Press Club, Dr. Mustansar Billah, PTI’s nominee from NA-219, expressed concern over the defeat of independent candidates aligned with PTI, alleging foul play orchestrated against them.
Dr Mustansar highlighted PTI’s purported nationwide dominance in the general elections, citing specific polling station data from NA-219, where PTI reportedly secured a significant number of votes. He criticized the traditional stronghold of MQM in Hyderabad, accusing them of manipulating the electoral process and undermining the democratic mandate.
Despite facing challenges such as the removal of PTI’s symbol, the “bat,” Dr. Mustansar emphasised the success of PTI candidates and implicated Returning Officers (ROs) and Senior Superintendents of Police (SSPs) in alleged rigging incidents. He pointed to specific instances, like in PS62, where PTI candidates were purportedly leading by a substantial margin but were declared losers under dubious circumstances.
Similarly, Naeemuddin, PTI’s nominee from PS64, echoed Dr Mustansar’s concerns, citing irregularities observed after the polling period ended. He lamented discrepancies between Form 45 and Form 47, indicating possible tampering with the election results. Naeemuddin asserted that these malpractices not only undermine the electoral process but also cast doubt on the credibility of esteemed national institutions.
The allegations put forth by PTI nominees underscore the need for transparent and fair electoral practices, ensuring the integrity of democratic processes and upholding the will of the people.

8,SHC orders verification for medico-legal certificates,"Such certificates in criminal cases to be signed by three health, police officers","The persisting controversies surrounding medico-legal certificates in criminal cases have long posed challenges for litigants and the judiciary alike. 
To address this issue, the Sindh High Court (SHC) has mandated that such certificates must now bear the signatures of three different concerned officers. 
Furthermore, medico-legal officers are required to capture coloured photographs of injuries, ensuring these visuals become a part of the official record.
The directive was issued on Monday by Justice Amjad Ali Sahito's bench at the Hyderabad Circuit, responding to a petition filed by Muhammad Siddique and others from Tando Allahyar district challenging a medico-legal certificate.
The judge not only introduced new measures to authenticate certificates but also placed restrictions on lower courts and the police, prohibiting the acceptance of certificates that do not comply with the order. 
The order explicitly states that any violation by medical officers will hold the Health Secretary accountable, and any breach by Investigating Officers (IOs) will make the Inspector General of Sindh Police responsible.
The bench emphasised the need to safeguard innocent people falsely implicated in criminal cases through fraudulent medical certificates. 
Often, such certificates and postmortem reports issued by Medico-Legal Officers (MLOs) are contested by litigants before medical boards.
Justice Sahito commended the Sindh Health Secretary for addressing the issue in light of the court's observations, citing a February 16 office order from the Sindh Health Department. 
The order has made it mandatory for MLOs to have certificates countersigned by police surgeons and medical superintendents of the respective health facilities. 
Additional police surgeons and additional medical superintendents are also authorised to sign these legal documents.
According to the court's order, all civil judges and judicial magistrates in the province will not accept medico-legal certificates and postmortem reports unless they are countersigned. The same directive extends to IOs of the Sindh police. The SHC's registrar has been tasked with circulating the order to all district and session judges for compliance by magistrates, with a copy sent to the IGP Sindh.
