0,Work on IP pipeline to begin in Pakistan,"Despite US sanctions, Islamabad accelerates project to avoid $18b penalty","Islamabad has engaged Tehran by committing to complete the first phase of the 80-kilometer Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project within Pakistan’s territory to avoid a looming $18 billion penalty. According to reports, Iran has granted an extension in the deadline of the IP gas pipeline project by 180 days until September 2024.
Tehran has granted this extension in a bid to avoid litigation in international court. Experts suggest that Pakistan and Iran could face strained diplomatic relations if Iran files a case against Pakistan in an international court. Iran could pursue legal action to safeguard its rights concerning the pipeline project.
Now, Pakistan has decided to proceed with the construction of the IP gas pipeline within its borders to satisfy Tehran, despite the sanctions imposed by the United States.
Sources indicate that the Petroleum division is seeking approval from the cabinet to commence work on the IP gas pipeline project in Pakistan. Additionally, the Board of Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) has been directed to expedite the financing process for the project.
Recently, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) referred a case of fertiliser manufacturers to the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) to investigate the unjustified increase in urea prices. The caretaker government also withdrew the subsidy on feedstock provided to fertiliser manufacturers.
Sources reveal that the government is displeased with these manufacturers who have accumulated billions of rupees from farmers under the guise of GIDC, which was intended for mega pipeline projects like IP, Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India (TAPI), and Liquefied natural gas (LNG) pipelines. However, they failed to deposit the money into the national exchequer and obtained stay orders from various courts, refusing to pay despite the Supreme Court’s decision.
Currently, the government requires funds from the GIDC collection, which has amounted to over Rs350 billion. However, this money has been allocated to projects like the orange train and has not been utilised for pipeline projects.
Industrialists such as fertiliser manufacturers have refused to pay over Rs450 billion. During the tenure of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) government, a 50% amount was waived off, but the Supreme Court directed payments in instalments. Nevertheless, the fertiliser manufacturers did not comply and obtained stay orders from lower courts.

Iran claims to have already spent $2 billion to complete its part of the pipeline within its territory. In contrast, Pakistan has not even commenced construction.
Previously, constructing the 80km portion of the IP pipeline project was part of the LNG Gwadar Pipeline project, intended to connect Gwadar with other parts of the country. It was agreed that Pakistan could construct this portion if relations between Tehran and Washington normalised and Pakistan was granted a waiver.
However, due to mounting pressure from Iran, Pakistan has now opted to build a portion of the IP gas pipeline project within its territory.
Earlier, under pressure from Saudi Arabia, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government decided to shelve the LNG Gwadar Pipeline. At that time, Pakistan considered constructing the 80-kilometer pipeline if the situation between the US and Iran stabilised.
In 2017, Saudi Arabia engaged in a diplomatic dispute with Qatar, pressuring Sharif’s government to abandon both the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline and the LNG contract with Qatar. Pakistan, however, only shelved the LNG Gwadar deal, which was deemed part of the IP gas pipeline project, and continued the LNG deal with Qatar.
The petroleum secretary previously informed the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that Pakistan faced the threat of $18 billion in claims due to the failure to commence construction on the IP project.
Historically, Pakistan and Iran have enjoyed good relations, particularly during the reign of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP). During Asif Ali Zardari’s presidency, both countries signed a Gas Sales Purchase Agreement (GSPA), binding Pakistan to commence construction on the IP project. In the past, Pakistan imported Iranian oil – the supply, however, ceased in 2010 when Pakistani refineries failed to make payments. Although payment was never a significant issue between the two nations – both had worked out currency swaps and barter trade arrangements – experts believe the primary reason for the fallout was the US’s reluctance to show flexibility regarding oil and gas trade between Pakistan and Iran.

1,PML-N choices for finance minister limited,"Dar, two bankers’ names float about as options remain few","The Pakistan Muslim League-N has not yet finalised its choice for a new finance minister, as it faces a hard decision between appointing the highly experienced Ishaq Dar as the finance minister and bringing in a new face at one of the most critical economic junctures.
The party’s dilemma is that if it decides to replace Dar, it may end up selecting a technocrat, which would deprive it of the claim of having an experienced economic team. The PML-N has not groomed second-tier economic leadership, and without Dar, it might end up relying on technocrats like the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
Sources in the PML-N told The Express Tribune that the party is also exploring other options, including considering the names of two bankers. They said that neither Dar nor anyone else has yet been finalised. However, a strong camp in the PML-N is not in favour of appointing Dar to the post for the fifth time, they added. However, the final decision would be made by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who has not yet to share his thoughts about his choice for the position. Dar’s name cannot be ruled out until Sharif shares his thoughts, they added.
Dar has served as finance minister four times and earned the reputation of a ‘tough negotiator’ with the International Monetary Fund. His relations with the IMF are now one of the reasons for the reconsideration of his appointment. However, Pakistan could not successfully complete the last $6.5 billion bailout package, and the blame has been placed squarely on Dar for his handling of the programme. In his speech at the Senate Standing Committee on Finance on June 16th, 2023, the former finance minister said that geopolitics was behind the stalled loan programme, as global institutions wanted Pakistan to default like Sri Lanka and enter negotiations.
The IMF has publicly denied this, while behind closed doors, the US had also complained about Dar’s statement. Sources said that in one of the meetings after Dar’s statement, US Ambassador Donald Blome had explained to Dar that his country did not have any influence on the IMF – a stance that the then finance minister did not agree with. The current IMF deal was finalised after the intervention of the then-PM Shehbaz Sharif.
Where Dar is blamed for the failure of the last programme, he has also been credited with completing the 2013-16 IMF programme.
The sources said that relations with the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and foreign powers, and the future role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), are the key considerations for selecting the nominee for the slot of finance minister.

Read Deadlock persists as fifth PML-N, PPP meeting ends inconclusively
However, criteria like clarity on strategic relations, political weight, and experience in managing the economy have not been given due weight at this time, according to party insiders.
In case Dar’s name is not chosen and the party decides to appoint a politician, former Minister for Economic Affairs Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and former Power Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif could be possible replacements. Former Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal might not be keen on taking the responsibility. The PML-N’s choices for appointing a politician as finance minister are limited after the exit of Miftah Ismail and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.
Newly elected Member of the National Assembly Bilal Kyani could either be appointed as the Minister of State for Finance in the centre, or he might be the next finance advisor to the chief minister of Punjab. The PPP has publicly opposed Dar’s candidacy, but its opposition does not carry weight until the party formally joins the next cabinet. The names of Muhammad Aurangzeb, the incumbent President of the Habib Bank Limited (HBL), and Sultan Ali Alana, the chairman of the HBL board, are also being considered for the position, according to some party insiders.
Aurangzeb is considered close to Shehbaz Sharif. Sultan Alana’s name had also been considered for the position of the caretaker finance minister, but then Dr Shamshad Akhtar’s name was finalised. The next finance minister’s first task will be to sit with the IMF, get the last loan tranche of $1.2 billion, and at the same time kick-start negotiations for a new long-term deal. Any inexperienced appointee might find it difficult to sit across the table and negotiate a deal that strikes a balance between economic stabilisation and people’s growing miseries.
One of the considerations for the next IMF programme might be the restructuring of unsustainable public debt. Bringing in a banker as finance minister might raise questions about conflicts of interest. The sources said that the establishment didn’t seem keen on importing a finance Minister this time, particularly after the experience of appointing a central banker from abroad.

2,CAD at 6-month high as outflows rise,"Increase in imports, outflow of FDI by $173m takes deficit to $269m in Jan 2024","Pakistan’s balance of the current account failed to stay in surplus for the second successive month, hitting a six-month high deficit of $269 million in the wake of a month-on-month increase in the import of goods and services in January 2024.
Besides, foreign investors – mainly China – aggressively pulled out investments from some power projects running in Pakistan, resulting in an outflow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by a notable $173 million in January 2024, interrupting a long spree of recording inflows in each month during the past two years. Moreover, such a large outflow in a month is seen after a gap of over five years.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) revised number, the current account recorded a surplus of $404 million in December 2023.
The current account deficit surged to $269 million in January 2024 compared to $167 million in the same month of the last year, rising by 61% in the month under review on a year-on-year basis.
Cumulatively in the first seven months (Jul-Jan) of the current fiscal year 2023-24, the current account deficit shrank 71% to $1.09 billion compared to $3.79 billion in the same period of the last year.
While talking to The Express Tribune, Optimus Capital Management’s Head of Research, Maaz Azam, said though the balance of the current account has shifted into a deficit in January from a surplus in the prior month, “However, it ($269 million) is not a large deficit. Rather, it is moderate and affordable.”
He said a 10% increase in imports to $4.51 billion in January compared to $4.10 billion in December 2023 played a pivotal role in contracting the balance of the current account.
The current account deficit aggregated with a 4% drop in exports of goods to $2.69 billion in the month compared to $2.79 billion in the previous month. And less than a 1% uptick in inflows of workers’ remittances to $2.39 billion in January compared to the previous month.
He said the increase in import is driven by the necessity for urea amid a shortage in the local markets, higher LNG imports in response to increased demand during the winter season. Additionally, the food sector experienced an uptick, primarily attributed to a 24% month-on-month surge in palm oil imports and a 47% month-on-month surge in imports of other food items.
He anticipated the current account deficit would remain near and around January 2024 level in the remaining five months of FY24 amid high inflation reading and almost no demand for goods in the local markets or it may slightly increase if the government liberalises imports to let the economic activities enhance.

Read PM directs steps to attract FDI
SBP stuck to its original forecast for achieving moderate economic growth in the range of 2-3% in FY23 compared to a negligible contraction in FY23.
He said the current account deficit stood at 0.3% of GDP ($1.09 billion) in seven months, agreeing with the central bank’s forecast for the full-year deficit to come in the range of 0.5% to 1.5% of GDP ($1.7 billion to $5.2 billion).
He said the immediate challenge to the nation is to sail out from political upheaval through forming a government and then going to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to secure a larger and longer-tenure loan programme in March-April 2024 to ensure repaying foreign debt on time and liberalising economic growth to create the required job opportunities.
In a report titled ‘Pakistan’s election outcome highlights risks to new IMF deal’, Fitch Ratings said on Monday the close outcome of Pakistan’s election and resulting near-term political uncertainty may complicate the country’s efforts to secure a financing agreement with the IMF, to succeed the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) expiring in March 2024. A new deal is key to the country’s credit profile, and “we assume one will be achieved within a few months, but an extended negotiation or failure to secure it would increase external liquidity stress and raise the probability of default.”
FDIs down
Topline Securities reported that Pakistan recorded a net FDI outflow of $173 million in January 2024 after a period of around two years.
Country-wise major outflow was witnessed from China ($225 million) and sector-wise major outflow witnessed in the power sector ($243 million) in January 2024.
China has apparently pulled out some investment after its power dues remain pending, and foreign companies operating in Pakistan witnessed a slowdown in the repatriation of profit to their headquarters in foreign countries in December 2023.
Cumulatively in the first seven months of FY24, net FDI inflow is down by 21% to $689 million compared to an inflow of $877 million in the same period of the last fiscal year.

3,IT exports dip 12.4% to $265m,Year-on-year exports see increase of 39.47% from $190m in January 2023,"The latest data from the State Bank of Pakistan has revealed a 12.54% decline in Telecommunications, Computer, and Information Technology exports for January 2024 compared to the previous month. The figures, released on Monday, indicate a decrease from $303 million in December 2023 to $265 million in January 2024.
However, on a year-on-year basis, there has been a notable increase of 39.47% in exports, with January 2023 recording exports worth $190 million. Despite this yearly growth, the month-on-month decrease points to challenges within the sector.
Overall service exports also saw a decline on a month-on-month basis, dropping by 7.25% to $678 million in January 2024 from $731 million in December 2023. Similarly, on a year-on-year basis, there was a 1.45% decrease in exports.
For the first seven months of the fiscal year 2023-24, the overall services export numbers stand at $678 million, reflecting a decline of 2.41% compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.
Experts in the IT sector had been warning of a potential slowdown in exports due to various infrastructural issues faced by software houses and freelancers in Pakistan. These issues have positioned Pakistani IT companies and individuals at a disadvantage compared to their regional counterparts.

Read IT exports expected to exceed $3b
According to industry experts, the reported figures include telecommunications and computer exports alongside IT exports, with call centres contributing significantly. However, concerns remain regarding the true representation of the IT sector’s performance in these numbers.
Many IT companies are reportedly considering shifting part of their operations to other countries, such as the UAE, due to infrastructural, political, and economic challenges in Pakistan.
The freelancing community, a significant contributor to IT exports, is also facing challenges, including internet suspensions and regulatory hurdles. Addressing these challenges is crucial to maintaining Pakistan’s position as an attractive outsourcing destination in the global market.
Despite being a cost-effective market, negative perceptions about Pakistan may impact future outsourcing decisions, underscoring the urgent need to address issues within the IT sector.

4,POL imports decline 12.06%,"Offset by increase in LNG, LPG import","Imports of the overall petroleum group have witnessed a decline of 12.06% during the first seven months of the ongoing financial year 2023-24, as revealed by data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS). From July to January (2023-24), total petroleum group imports amounted to $9,332.322 million, down from $10,611.727 million in the corresponding period the previous year.
Within the petroleum category, imports of petroleum products notably decreased by 25.94%, falling from $4,889.799 million to $3,621.420 million. Meanwhile, imports of petroleum crude witnessed a smaller decline of 3.96%, dropping from $3,100.481 million to $2,977.671 million during the review period.
On a year-on-year basis, petroleum group imports showed a marginal increase of 0.03% in January 2024 compared to January of the previous year, rising from $1,326.205 million to $1,326.540 million. However, on a month-on-month basis, petroleum imports into the country dropped by 14.52% in January 2024 compared to December 2023 when imports stood at $1,551.870 million, according to the data provided.
Oil industry officials say that the sale of petrol witnessed an average decline of 6%, whereas high-speed diesel saw a 7% decrease during the first seven months of the current financial year. They attribute this decline in sales to inflation and economic slowdown.

Although the prices of petroleum products have substantially declined, they remain relatively expensive, contributing to the decrease in imports. Refineries have also raised concerns over the rise in smuggling of petroleum products from Iran, which has impacted legal industry sales.
Despite the overall decline in petroleum imports, imports of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) experienced a 4.82% increase, rising from $2,192.489 million to $2,298.144 million. This increase is attributed to additional LNG cargoes arranged to meet rising demand, particularly during the recent winter season.
Meanwhile, the import of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) grew by 1.47%, reaching $434.991 million compared to $428.687 million in the corresponding period of 2022-23, driven by increased demand during the winter months due to natural gas shortages for domestic consumers.

5,Rupee surpasses Rs282/$,"According to ECAP currency drops by 0.08%, or Rs0.23, on a day-to-day basis in market","The Pakistani currency declined further, surpassing Rs282 against the US dollar in the open market on Monday. This marks the seventh consecutive working day of losses, driven by increased demand for the greenback amidst heightened political uncertainty in the country.
According to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan, the currency dropped by 0.08%, or Rs0.23, on a day-to-day basis in the market. According to SBP data, the domestic currency held steady at Rs279.32/$ in the interbank market on Monday. The contrasting trends in the two markets have widened the disparity in the currency’s value to Rs2.84, gradually approaching the IMF recommended maximum limit of 1.25%, equivalent to around Rs4 at current values. The spread stood at around Rs1.50 just a couple of weeks ago.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, ECAP General Secretary, Zafar Paracha said, “The demand for foreign currencies has increased by around 10% compared to pre-election times. People are buying currencies in advance to hedge against speculated further rupee depreciation. Things will normalise soon.”

REER Appreciates
Pakistan’s real effective exchange rate (REER), the value of the local currency compared to a basket of currencies of foreign trading partner countries, “increased to 101.7 in January 2024 from 98.8 in December 2023,” according to SBP.
This trend indicates that imports have become slightly cheaper while exports have become less competitive, presenting a challenging outlook for the balance of trade going forward.
Earlier, SBP maintained REER mostly around 95-96 during 2020-2023.

7,PSX rebounds on political stability optimism,"KSE-100 index surges 586.78 points, settles at 60,459.74","The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a notable recovery on Monday, driven by investor optimism regarding breakthroughs in coalition government negotiations, effectively mitigating ongoing political uncertainty.
In the morning, the trading session commenced on a lacklustre note, touching an intraday low of 59,191.85 points. Despite this initial dip, investor confidence rebounded following the Supreme Court’s postponement of a hearing challenging the validity of the February 9 elections. Consequently, the KSE-100 index started to climb.
Additionally, Fitch Ratings’ affirmation of an imminent coalition government, a surge in foreign exchange reserves, and the recent inclusion of 22 firms in the frontier market and small-cap index by Morgan Stanley Capital International’s (MSCI) further lifted the index. Resultantly, the market crossed the significant 60,00 barrier, reaching an intraday high of 60,504.48 points in its final hours of trading.
The bourse concluded the day near its peak, reporting substantial gains.
“Stocks showed sharp recovery on investor speculations over a major breakthrough in negotiations over the coalition government setup later today, easing political instability,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Fitch Ratings’ assertion on all set for the coalition government, surging foreign exchange reserves, and MSCI’s inclusion of 22 firms to the frontier market and small-cap index last week played a catalyst role in the bullish close in the post-election rally at PSX.”
At the close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded gains of 586.78 points, or 0.98%, settling at 60,459.74.
Topline Securities noted in its report that the “KSE 100 Index opened on a negative note as the index declined to make an intraday low of -681 points. However, investors came in to accumulate after the Supreme Court on Monday postponed the hearing of the petition that sought to declare the February 8 national elections as ‘null and void’ due to the petitioner’s non-appearance.”
Major positive contributions to the index came from Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum, Hub Power Company, Engro Corporation, and Bank Al Habib as they cumulatively contributed 419 points to the index. On the flip side, United Bank, Nestle Pakistan, Colgate-Palmolive, Dawood Hercules Corporation, and Pakistan Oilfields lost value, weighing down on the index by -88 points, Topline added.

Arif Habib Limited (AHL) observed in its report the intraday low of 59,191 in early doors, before a strong rally to close +1.18% DoD.
“51 stocks rose while 39 fell with Oil and Gas Development Company (+7.04%), Pakistan Petroleum (+6.42%), and Hub Power Company (+2.36%) being the biggest contributors to index gains,” it said, adding that the political situation remains fluid, which is expected to keep volatility in the market high.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal noted that the KSE-100 index opened in the red owing to continued political uncertainty but eventually gained to close at 60,460, gaining 587 points.
“Going forward, a cautious approach is recommended. Investors are recommended to wait for dips before engaging in fresh accumulation,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 261.7 million shares against Friday’s tally of 314.2 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs9.91 billion.
Shares of 330 companies were traded, with 170 stocks closing higher, 139 dropping, and 21 remaining unchanged.

8,Industries at risk as energy costs surge,"Industrialists warn of impending job losses, inflation amid escalating tariffs","Rising gas and electricity tariffs threaten to shutter industries, drive up unemployment, and worsen inflation, lamented distressed industrialists.

Speaking to The Express Tribune, President of the Federal B Area Association of Trade and Industry (FBATI), Syed Raza Hussain highlighted the impact of the gas tariff increase on small and medium-sized entrepreneurs already grappling with production costs and competitive pricing.

“The merciless hike in gas prices will have dire consequences on SMEs, including cost-cutting which will result in joblessness and retail price hikes, exacerbating inflation alongside escalating electricity and petroleum product prices,” warned Hussain.

Calling for a review of government policies, Hussain urged a shift towards pro-industry and pro-business decisions to spur production and tax revenue growth.

Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), President, Atif Ikram Sheikh echoed concerns, particularly regarding the alarming surge in captive gas prices, which could spell disaster for Pakistan’s industrial sectors.

Sheikh underscored the ripple effect of soaring energy costs, leading to higher production expenses passed on to consumers, exacerbating financial strains amid persistent inflation.

He called for a comprehensive reassessment of energy pricing frameworks, noting the unfeasible manufacturing landscape and the deterrence of domestic and foreign investment in Pakistan.

Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry, President, Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani questioned the rationale behind a recent electricity price hike approved by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA).

Read NEPRA mulls record Rs5.62/unit hike in electricity prices

Shaikhani highlighted government decisions contributing to mounting circular debt and the shutdown of industries, urging clarity on the reasons behind substantial fuel adjustment increases.

Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) President Adeel Siddiqui criticised the caretaker federal government for its failure to prioritise renewable energy production. He highlighted that this negligence led to a recent Rs4.567 per unit cost hike in fuel prices, approved by NEPRA for December 2023 bills.

In a statement issued on Monday evening, Siddiqui lamented the decrease in renewable energy production in 2023 compared to 2022 figures. He condemned the current caretaker administration’s incompetence, noting that consumers would bear the brunt of this increase in fuel prices, reflected in their February bills following NEPRA's approval.

Siddiqui urged for the rehabilitation of closed powerhouses and underscored the importance of investing in research and advanced technology to meet energy production needs. Specifically, he proposed utilising locally produced coal to operate the 1,300MW Jamshoro coal powerhouse. Additionally, Siddiqui underscored the necessity of enhancing the efficiency of power distribution companies.

Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) officials stated that the Large Tax Payer Office Karachi had requested additional documents from the tractor manufacturing company to process the sales tax refund claim. The company then filed an application in the Sindh High Court, which was dismissed as inadmissible. In its judgment, the SHC referred to the recent Supreme Court judgment in the Digi com case, reiterating the importance of following the legal process.
