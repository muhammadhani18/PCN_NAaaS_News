0,Judges raise legal issues on SJC authority over retired judges,Bench says justice delivery could be affected if judges fear investigations,"Several legal issues were raised by the sitting judges during hearing of a case on Monday, pertaining to the Supreme Judicial Council's (SJC) authority to pursue complaints against retired or resigned Supreme Court judges.

Justice Jamal Mandokhel voiced concern that proceedings against judges could hinder justice delivery, as judges might fear repercussions. He emphasised that judicial immunity existed not for personal benefit, but to safeguard the public's right to justice.

A five-member larger bench, led by Justice Aminuddin Khan heard the appeal of the federal government regarding the SJC proceedings against the retired or resigned judges of the Supreme Court.

Amicus curie Faisal Siddiqui argued that if the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act were implemented from October 11, instead of April 21, this appeal could not be heard. However, Justice Khan told the lawyer that he should argue on the main case, rather than on appeal’s admissibility.

Siddiqui replied that he only wanted to draw the court’s attention that the provision of the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act about retrospective application had been declared null and void.
He said that ordinary laws did not apply to judges. He argued that action could be taken if there were allegations of corruption against a judge. However, he added that SJC jurisdiction ceased with the retirement of the judge.

Justice Khan asked the question whether that SJC process ended with the judge's retirement. Justice Mandokhel said if he committed a crime as a judge, would his resignation clear him of all the crimes.
Sitting on the bench, Justice Irfan Saadat said that the SJC had disposed of the proceedings against a former chief justice. He then asked the question whether the proceedings could be reopened if the SJC had already given its opinion once.

Justice Mandokhel asked whether chief justice could hold the SJC hostage or could he hear a complaint against himself in the SJC? Siddiqui replied that as per rules, the judge who faced complaint should recuse himself from the SJC proceedings.

Siddiqui further told the bench that inquiry rules were for the sitting judges only. Also sitting on the bench, Justice Mussarat Hilali remarked that the inquiry rules were silent regarding a judge against whom the proceedings were pending.

Siddiqui further said that no one stopped institutions like the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) or other anti-corruption institutions from corruption investigations against the judges.

Justice Mandokhel remarked that if any institution started proceedings against the judges, would it not put the judges in fear. Siddiqui said that the government could amend the Presidential Order, 1987, for withdrawing the pension and benefits for the judge.

Later, another amicus curie Moiz Jafari started his arguments, saying that if the ordinary laws were applied to judges, the independence of the judiciary would be affected. He added that judges would be under constant fear that the FIA or the NAB might take action against them.

He stressed that any action against judges could be recommended by the SJC otherwise, if the general rules were applied to the judges, every one of them would be sitting before a police inspector on the next day of his retirement.

Jafari made a point that after the resignation or retirement of a judge, the SJC’s recommendation for the removal of the judge became ineffective.

However, another amicus curie Akram Shaikh argued that once the SJC started its proceedings against a judge, it could not end.

Misconduct of a judge and his ability not to be a judge were two different things, Shaikh said, adding that the termination of the proceedings upon the resignation of judge would give the impression that the SJC was dependent on the will of the judge.

The hearing was adjourned till Wednesday (tomorrow).

1,Senate shoots down public hanging bill,"Presented by JI, piece of legislation sought public execution of rapists, sex offenders","The upper house of parliament has rejected a bill seeking public execution of sex offenders and rapists as a deterrent against such heinous crimes.

Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan of the JI introduced the bill during the Senate's farewell session, chaired by Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani on Monday.

Defending the bill, Senator Khan referred to a report stating that 1,122 cases of rape were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) province alone in the last five years.

He stated that following these incidents, the police arrested 581 individuals, of whom 494 were acquitted and only 87 were convicted. He added that 341 of the suspects were booked for raping women, but only 23 were sentenced.

Senator Mushtaq mentioned that 152 people accused of raping children were acquitted, while courts sentenced only 64 of them. “According to one report, in the first six months of 2023, 12 children were targeted for sexual assault every month,” he said.

He proposed, ""Let just four such public executions be held, and this crime will end. Don't be afraid of America and Europe; strict punishments are necessary to control crime.""

Senator Kamil Ali Agha of the PML-Q supported the bill, citing the practice in America where authorities release videos of lethal injections being administered to convicts.

“In Saudi Arabia, public executions are carried out. If we are Muslims, our stance should be correct. What is happening in the world is not important; what Islam says is important.""

Senator Humayun Mohmand of the PTI also voiced support for public hanging of rape convicts. ""In countries where public executions are carried out, crime rates are low. Where hands are cut off, theft is also minimal,"" he said.

PPP’s Senator Sherry Rehman opposed the bill, stating that public hanging spreads barbarism.
She mentioned that the PPP had opposed the death penalty for rape and emphasized the need for improving policing rather than focusing solely on death penalty laws.

“Pakistan ranks fifth in the world in terms of the death penalty. Public hanging does not suit a society of the 21st century. Public hanging will not stop crime,” she said.

Senator Irfan Siddiqui of the PML-N also opposed the bill regarding public hanging, saying that hanging should be confined to the gallows. PML-N’s Senator Ishaq Dar said since the death penalty is already part of the law, they are against public hanging.

Interestingly, Barrister Ali Zafar, who also belongs to the PTI, opposed the bill.

“We support the current law which includes the death penalty. However, we oppose public hanging. Instead of public executions and hangings on the streets, efforts should be made to improve the justice system,” he said.

When Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani conducted a vote on the bill, 14 members voted in favor, while 24 members voted against it. Consequently, the chairman rejected the motion to present the bill for approval.

During the session, PTI members surrounded the chairman's dais, protesting vehemently against alleged election rigging. The protest ended after the chairman assured them of a detailed discussion on alleged election rigging today (Tuesday).

2,Election tribunals likely to decide rigging disputes,PTI candidates trying to obtain relief either from ECP or superior courts,"Despite the suspension of notification regarding the victory of three MNAs by the Islamabad High Court, the final fate of the alleged election-rigging disputes are likely to be decided by the election tribunals, which is a time-consuming process.

However, the current week is very significant as either the superior judiciary or the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) will look into the matter or the matter will be referred to the election tribunals for trial.
The PTI candidates are trying to obtain relief either from the ECP through summary proceedings or the superior courts.

The ECP will take up the PTI candidates’ complaints today (Tuesday) against the issuance of final results without considering the Form-45 results given by the presiding officers.

The IHC division bench led by Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb will resume the hearing on election matters on Wednesday.

The PTI lawyers are hoping for some relief from this bench. However, PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, mistrust IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq.

The PTI has an advantage that some lawyers who contested the elections are aggrieved by the final results. Now, they are approaching every legal forum for relief though they have no support from both the superior bars – Pakistan Bar Council and Supreme Court Bar Association. However, it is being witnessed that the PTI has no one policy to challenge the election results.

A PTI lawyer agreed that the aggrieved candidates should have approached the Supreme Court on this controversy. However, a senior lawyer believes that final adjudication of election disputes by the superior courts will change the settled law and also create grave complications.

He believes that the apex court should give a strict timeline to the election tribunals for final decisions of election petitions. He expressed apprehension that if the superior courts intervene, then every losing candidate will want the same treatment.

The sanctity of ballot is likely to be undermined, he added. However, the PTI lawyer disagreed with the contention, saying that if the SC allows this election fraud, then there will be serious implications on democracy.

This bad precedent of election rigging through issuance of Form-47 will be remembered for decades and it will be misused in the election process every time, he added.

The PTI lawyer also states that adjudication of election tribunal is a time-consuming process.

Even if the tribunal de-seats any candidate, then he may get a stay order from the apex court.
There is a need that the SC should form an inquiry commission to probe the allegations of alleged systematic rigging in the elections, he added.

Hafiz Hussain Khokhar advocate has said that the ECP does have jurisdiction under Section 9 read with other provisions relating to all corrupt practices regarding the election matters and can pass any order. However, when the election tribunals have been notified under Section 140 of the Elections Act 2017 for the entertainment and adjudication of election petitions, then no court, including the high courts, can exercise their jurisdiction relating to the election matter of a particular constituency or many constituencies in view of bar contained in Article 225 of the Constitution where it has been described that all election disputes will be decided by tribunals and this legal proposition in such a way has been many times decided by the SC and different high courts through their various judgments.

He also said that generally, the high court declines from interfering in constitutional jurisdiction relating to post-election matters or corrupt election practices, and this has been evident from the recent orders of the high court where all these types of applications filed in writ jurisdiction after this general election were forwarded to the ECP to be decided in accordance with law.

A three-judge bench of the apex court led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa will take up ex-military officer Ali Khan's petition on Wednesday, which seeks a declaration that the February 8 elections were rigged, urging for a fresh round.

The PTI has disadvantage that all state institutions are on the same page regarding major issues.
Although the petitioner has requested for withdrawal of the petition, the bench is determined to decide it on merit.

The SC has ordered to serve notice on the petitioner through the defence ministry or the SHO concerned.

Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in ex-army chief Gen (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa job extension case had noted that a public interest litigation (PIL) can only be withdrawn with the permission of the court.

This is because it does not raise a personal issue limited to the petitioner; it is not a dominis litis (the person to whom a suit belongs) that would give a right to the petitioner to withdraw it as a matter of choice. “In granting the permission (to withdraw) the Court would be guided by considerations of public interest and would also ensure that it does not result in the abuse of the process of law.

“Courts must guard against possibilities of such litigants settling the matters out of Court to their advantage and then seeking withdrawal of the case.

“Sometimes withdrawal of a public interest litigation, for oblique ends, can be used to the detriment of the public interest agitated therein. The Court has to be cautious not to fall prey to such oblique motives. The proceedings in public interest litigation are inquisitorial in nature and, therefore, the request for withdrawal of such litigation must always be weighed in the light of the question of public importance raised in it.

“A petitioner initiating public interest litigation is, therefore, not entitled to withdraw the petition at his sweet will. The Court, however, may permit withdrawal of such litigation on considering the nature of the matter agitated therein and ensuring that it does not involve abuse of the process of law,"", the detailed judgement authored by Justice Shah said.

Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad also highlighted that in three provinces and in the capital, the election tribunals have been notified and the judges of respective high courts have been designated for such election petitions, thus all pending cases relating to the election disputes of general elections 2024 would ultimately be decided by them in 120 days and not by the high courts in writ jurisdiction, and these pending matters before the appointment of election tribunal would ultimately land in election tribunal.

3,Cyber threats increased by 17% in 2023,Research reveals 16m cyberattacks were blocked,"Experts of the global cybersecurity and digital privacy company Kaspersky have revealed that the number of overall cyber threats in Pakistan increased by 17% in 2023 as compared to 2022.
The facts surfaced in a recent discussion on the evolution of the cyber threat landscape in the region during its 9th annual Cyber Security Weekned-META 2024 on Monday, a statement said.
Kaspersky blocked 16 million cyberattacks in 2023 whereas 24.4% of users in Pakistan are affected by online threats.
The focal point of the discussions was the security of emerging technology trends such as AI that are influencing the scale of modern threats.
In parallel, threats targeting industrial control systems within critical infrastructure, in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia were also discussed.
Dissecting the threat landscape further, Kaspersky experts saw attacks using banking malware rose by 59%. Such attacks are designed to collect online banking credentials and other sensitive information from infected machines.
Researchers also reported an increase of 35% in trojan attacks that disguise themselves as legitimate computer programmes but are used to run malicious code by cyber criminals.
In addition, ransomware attacks designed to encrypt a victim’s data, files, or system, making them accessible in exchange for a payment, increased by 24%.
Also, the researchers reported attacks using spyware rose by 36%, such attacks are malicious software that enters a user’s computer, gathers data from the device and user, and sends it to third parties without their consent.
“Being an emerging country and accepting digital transformation at a good pace, Pakistan has a very important role to play in Asia”, the statement added.
As the cybersecurity landscape evolves, cyber threats continue to become diverse and sophisticated.
This trend is particularly evident due to the emergence of advanced technologies like AI and the escalating geopolitical and economic turbulence within the META region.
META Research Center Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) Director Amin Hasbini stated that these factors collectively contribute to the surge in cybercrime and the heightened complexity of cyberattacks.
According to Kaspersky’s analysis, the cybersecurity threat landscape in the META region has fluctuated significantly.
In the region, Turkey saw the highest number of users affected by online threats – 41.8%, followed by Kenya 39.2%, Qatar 38.8% and South Africa 35%.
Fewer users were affected in Oman – 23.4% and Egypt 27.4% followed by Saudi Arabia 29.9% and Kuwait 30.8%. app

5,"Four dead as rain, snowfall unleash chaos","Power outages, fatalities, traffic chaos plague regions","The inclement weather in the northern regions of the country wreaked havoc for the second consecutive day on Monday, claiming the lives of over four people and leaving nine others injured.

The severe weather conditions led to the suspension of electricity supply in numerous areas of the province, with casualties occurring due to roof collapses in Swat, Lower Dir, Upper Dir, Lower Kurram, and Mardan.

The second day of relentless rain and snowfall on Monday left a trail of disruptions, power outages, and tragic incidents across Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and upper areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Tourists found themselves stranded as their vehicles got stuck in the aftermath of heavy snowfall in popular destinations such as Galyat, Nathia Gali, Dunga Gali, Thandiani, and Ayubiya.

Electricity supply was abruptly halted, while the Meteorological Department warned of more snowfall in the next 24 hours.

In Abbottabad and surrounding areas, three consecutive days of non-stop rain have been recorded, leading to a suspension of business activities. Meanwhile, the upper regions, including Galyat and Thandiani, witnessed over two feet of snowfall, causing the closure of the main Murree Road for all vehicular traffic due to heavy snow and landslides.

Director-General of Galiyat Development Authority (GDA), Shah Rukh Ali Khan, has instructed the deployment of staff with heavy machinery to clear the snow and ensure the safety of the roads.
Efforts are underway to clear the roads leading to Nathiagali and Murree, with the combined resources of GDA and C&W.

Widespread damage was caused by the storm, with trees, billboards, signboards, and electric wires and poles collapsing in various locations.

In Murree, powerful winds resulted in the roofs of numerous houses being blown off.
The disruption extended to the electrical infrastructure, as several feeders tripped, leading to the suspension of electricity supply in most areas. The continuous rain has heightened the risk of landslides in affected regions.

Authorities in Murree district, along with relevant institutions, have been put on high alert in response to the unfolding situation.

Similarly, the plains and upper regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa grappled with the aftermath of continuous snowfall and rains for the second consecutive day, causing widespread disruptions and tragic incidents.

As rain and snowfall persisted, a total of three hundred and six feeders tripped in different areas, leaving most regions without electricity for over fourteen hours.

Compounding the crisis on Monday, 306 feeders tripped across different areas of the province due to the rain, leading to electricity outages lasting more than fourteen hours in many regions.

The accumulation of water on major highways in Peshawar caused severe problems for commuters, with Peshawar's key commercial area, University Road, resembling a flood scene. Despite the cessation of rains, traffic remained gridlocked for hours.

In the low-lying areas of Peshawar, residences near rivers and canals faced water ingress. Local residents rallied to assist in pumping water out of affected houses, demonstrating a community response to the crisis.

Looking ahead, the Meteorological Department anticipates the continuation of rain in the plains of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and snowfall in the upper districts over the next 24 hours.

6,IHC seeks answers on phone surveillance,"Expresses displeasure at absence of PEMRA chairman, Intelligence Bureau DG","The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has once again summoned the heads of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) in a case related to the illegal recording of private telephonic conversations.
An IHC bench comprising Justice Babar Sattar issued this order on Monday as it resumed hearing the petitions filed by Najam-us-Saqib, son of former Chief Justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar, and Bushra Bibi, the wife of former prime minister Imran Khan in the wake of the leaking of their alleged telephone calls.
The FIA director-general, Waqar Uddin Syed, appeared in court along with a representative of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), Asif Bashir Chaudhry.
At the last hearing of the case, the court had also summoned the director-general of the IB and the chairmen of the PTA and the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA). However, the officials did not appear in court.
Angered by their absence, Justice Sattar asked the state law officer why the court should not issue their arrest warrants. “How did they decide themselves that they couldn't appear in court?” he asked.
The government lawyer informed the bench that the IB director-general was unwell, but the IB’s deputy dg was present in court. The IHC noted that the officers who are unwell should present their medical reports at the next hearing.
Later, the judge asked the FIA director-general to appear in court at the next hearing and explain how surveillance and recording of phone calls take place.
“The director-general of the IB must inform us who can conduct surveillance on the citizens of Pakistan and whether the state of Pakistan has the capability to remain secure from illegal surveillance.
“The PTA chairman should also brief us on the steps that can be taken to secure the calls and data of mobile phone users,” Justice Sattar added. The court later adjourned till the first week of March.
In a reply submitted on Dec 19, 2023, the Federal Ministry of Defence had told the IHC that only a social media platform can tell which user has uploaded a particular content—audio, video, or picture—on it.
The ministry had highlighted that only the FIA has access and power to request such information from these platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and X.
“Under [Pakistan Electronic Crime Act] PECA, 2016, FIA Cyber Crime Wing is [the] designated agency for [curbing] cybercrimes.
“Under Section 35 of PECA, the FIA has power to access or demand any information in readable and comprehensive format or plain version from service providers [social media platforms]. [The] court may direct [the] FIA cybercrime wing to further investigate the matter and get the details,” it said.
The report stated that various tools are available on smartphones to record phone conversations.
“These tools are cheap and easily available to everyone. Moreover, various groups provide paid services under which they claim to steal data from devices through various means,” it added.
The report noted that a caller can also record his or her phone conversation with someone, and that recorded call can get leaked or hacked.
It said with the advancement in artificial intelligence, it is now possible through various available tools to alter one’s voice or change the content of any conversation. “These tools can be used to mimic someone,” it added.
In its written order issued on December 23, the court had expressed shock at the revelation that the state does not have the capacity to find out who records private telephonic conversations of citizens and how this illegal act is carried out.""

7,"SC debates martial law, pressure, procedural doubts in Bhutto case",CJ says heirs of late Bhutto will also be heard in presidential reference,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday delved into intricacies of the presidential reference about the death penalty awarded to former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto more than four decades ago, asking questions about the historical and contemporary legal frameworks.
During a hearing of the reference, Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, and Justice Jamal Mandokhel raised several law points, concerning institutional action and individual initiative in enforcing martial law, importance of assessing cases on a contextual basis and the procedural matters.
Heading a nine-member bench, Chief Justice Isa questioned whether the commencement of legal proceedings against Bhutto during the martial law period could be disregarded.
He observed that a martial law was not declared by the military as an institution rather it was an individual’s initiative.
Prompting a broader contemplation of the role of institutions in drawing boundaries within the legal landscape, he said: “We are looking at the past but not considering the future. Shouldn’t institutions also draw the line?”
Justice Mansoor remarked that such cases might come up in the future, therefore, instead of an opinion on the reference, the bench should look at the cases when they arose.
The chief justice remarked that the court’s focus was on the constitutional aspect, adding that a case could not be revised twice.
Justice Mansoor remarked that the real question in this case was whether or not the proper process was followed in the court proceedings.
However, Justice Mandokhel said that the case had attained finality, therefore, the question in the reference could be decided in an appeal.
The chief justice asked amicus curie Makhdoom Ali Khan, was there a question of bias or an admission of wrongdoing in this case. Makhdoom replied that a judge, who sat on the apex court bench on Bhutto’s appeal, had said in an interview that there was pressure on them.

However, the chief justice pointed out that the judge did not say that he was biased.
He added that if a judge could not withstand pressure, he should leave the bench.
Further, he continued, a person might raise the issue of prejudice, but others might not have the same opinion.
The chief justice also enquired about a judge’s remarks about a cat in the Bhutto case.
Makhdoom said that Justice Qaiser Khan had once said that “even a cat cannot be hanged”, on the basis of the evidence in the Bhutto case and that the manner in which Bhutto’s case was decided had never happened before.
Makhdoom said that Bhutto’s case bench member Naseem Hasan Shah had dilated on the differences between Bhutto and Justice Molvi Mushtaq.
Naseem had said that Mushtaq was unhappy with Bhutto for ignoring eight senior judges and appointing Justice Aslam Riaz as the chief justice.
The chief justice said that Naseem was talking about other judges. He then asked where it was stated that he was under pressure to take a decision.
Makhdoom replied that it was not specific to this case but in the overall context.
Naseem – who retired as the chief justice of Pakistan – had also said that the court could have given the benefit of the doubt, but it did not because of its weakness and that the then defence counsel Yahya Bakhtiar had angered the judges, Makhdoom said.
He added that Naseem had said in an interview that Bhutto’s lawyer did not argue for reducing the sentence and had angered the judges.
The chief justice remarked that if one got angry, then he could have stopped hearing the case, adding that the client should not be punished for the lawyer’s conduct.
The chief justice said Bhutto’s case was the first in the history of Pakistan where the trial took place at a high court, which consequently, took away the right to appeal.
He also referred to the Supreme Court’s 4-3 ruling that upheld Bhutto’s hanging. “Can death penalty be given with a ratio of 4-3.”
Justice Mansoor said that there was only one interview related to pressure on the judges.
He asked whether those, who were accused of partiality, should also be heard.
He pointed out that those who disagreed with the decision had to leave the country.
Later, the court ordered that as Makhdoom had given gave his arguments, his written statement be submitted. It added that another amicus curie Khalid Javed Khan had made his written submission and he could give his oral arguments at the next hearing.
The court said that heirs of the late Bhutto would also be heard, including Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s lawyers Farooq Naek, Raza Rabbani, and Zahid Ibrahim.
The court said that Ahmad Raza Kasuri, would also be heard.
The attorney general apprised the bench that he would take a little time at the end. The court was adjourned till Feb 26.

8,New judge appointed at capital’s NAB court,Judge Nasir Javed Rana replaces Judge Muhammad Bashir at Islamabad Accountability Court-I,"The Ministry of Law and Justice has appointed a district and sessions judge, Nasir Javed Rana, as the new judge at Islamabad Accountability Court-I. The accountability court’s incumbent judge, Muhammad Bashir, is set to retire on March 14.

According to the notification issued by the ministry on Monday, Nasir Javed Rana has been appointed as a judge of the accountability court until January 24, 2027.

On January 20, Judge Bashir applied for medical leave until his retirement.

In the letter sent to the IHC and the Ministry of Law and Justice, the judge stated that due to his deteriorating health, he could not perform his duties.

However, the ministry did not approve his request. After his request was denied, the judge withdrew his application on January 27, stating that he was now well and able to perform his duties.

On January 28, Judge Bashir sentenced former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse, Bushra Bibi, to 14 years in prison for misusing the state’s gift repository during the former’s term as PM. On February 3, the judge once again applied for leave until his retirement on medical grounds.

Judge Bashir was adjudicating a number of high-profile cases, including the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) references filed against former Imran Khan and his wife for their alleged involvement in a £190m scandal.

The judge was also hearing another Toshakhana reference involving former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Yousuf Raza Gillani, as well as former president Asif Ali Zardari as accused.

He was also presiding over the hearing of a fake account case registered against Zardari and a NAB reference against former PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.

Appointed in 2012 during the tenure of then-PM Gilani, the judge served an unusually long term. Although accountability court judges are typically appointed for three years, Judge Bashir served in the NAB court for eleven years.

His tenure saw appointments by former PM Nawaz Sharif in 2018 and PM Imran Khan in 2021. Judge Muhammad Bashir is probably the only judge in the country who has convicted two former prime ministers in corruption cases.

9,Pakistan a ‘global joke after mother of all rigging’: Imran,"‘Selected ones’ have honoured the boot, Aleema says quoting Imran"," 
In a scathing criticism of the Feb 8 general elections, PTI's founder Imran Khan has denounced the poll irregularities as the ""mother of all rigging,"" asserting that it has turned Pakistan into a global laughing stock, according to statements made by his sister, Aleema Khan.

Speaking to the media outside Adiala Jail, Aleema relayed Imran's statement, sharing that the PTI founder referred to the ""mother of all U-turns"" as giving respect to the ""boot"" instead of the vote.

Quoting Imran, she said that the “mother of all selections” involved dropping criminal cases against certain individuals and shifting the blame onto the PTI founder, resulting in a 32-year sentence.

Aleema asserted that pre-poll and election-day rigging aimed to undermine the people's right to choose their representatives and voters' freedom to make informed decisions.

Aleema Khan said that her brother wants the culture of impunity to end and the mandate of the people must be respected to salvage the country’s reputation internationally.

Imran also ridiculed his arch nemesis, the PML-N, which willingly bartered away its narrative to grab power. “Instead of honouring the vote, the ‘selected ones’ have honoured the boot,” Aleema quoted Imran.

“The selection was so blatant and blind that corruption cases were dropped by the selectors against the ‘selected ones’,” she further stated quoting her brother.“Instead the PTI chairman was sentenced to 32 years in jail after marathon trials on trumped up charges.”

Imran said that pre-poll, election day, and post-election rigging denied the people of Pakistan their democratic right to choose their representatives.

“On the voting day, the internet was shut down, leaving people perplexed. But when it did not work, post-poll rigging was carried out at night by brazenly changing the results by ignoring Form 45,” he added.

The incarcerated PTI chairman also referred to the Rawalpindi commissioner who in a recent damning video confession admitted to rigging the election for the PML-N.

“Not just one commissioner, there are many more who have ample evidence of rigging, but they have been silenced,” he said while fearing that the commissioner would be subjected to physical torture.
