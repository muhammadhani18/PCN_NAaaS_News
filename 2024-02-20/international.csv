Addressing the media at the Peshawar Press Club, PPP Provincial Information Secretary Amjad Khan Afridi, alongside Misbahuddin and Ayub Shah, said that his opponent was crying foul and raising hue and cry, while it was him, in fact, who has been the victim of fraud.
He lamented that no one was lending an ear to his grievances and his requests were falling on deaf ears.

He bemoaned that despite his application to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to halt the announcement of the opposing candidate's success, the notification was issued without consideration.
Expressing objection to the judges of the election tribunal, Afridi warned, ""If our voices continue to go unheard, we will be left with no choice but to take to the streets in protest.""
The PPP leader alleged that PTI and its splinter group, PTI-Parliamentarians, were two sides of the same coin.

5,"28,150 treated under health card","Programme CEO Kakar highlights three-month achievements, challenges","A total of 28,185 patients have been provided free medical treatment under the Balochistan Health Card Programme since its launch on Nov 1, 2023. 
A meeting chaired by caretaker Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Ali Mardan Khan Domki on Monday reviewed the programme. 
Chief Secretary Shakeel Qadir Khan, Principal Secretary Rashid Razak Khan, Secretary Health Abdullah Khan, Secretary Finance Babar Khan, Balochistan Health Card Programme Chief Executive Officer Asadullah Kakar and Balochistan Revenue Authority Chairman Noor Baloch were in attendance.
The meeting was aimed at scrutinising the performance of the programme and addressing challenges.
CEO Kakar provided a comprehensive overview of the programme's performance, highlighting both its achievements and challenges. 
“Notably, the programme's inclusive nature is commendable, as it offers access to high-quality healthcare services in 1,200 hospitals nationwide, catering to individuals from diverse economic backgrounds,” he said, adding that however, concerns persist regarding the dissemination of information about the programme's benefits and administrative obstacles it faces.

“The treatment of 28,185 patients through the programme signifies substantial progress in improving healthcare accessibility.” 
Particularly in Quetta, he added, a significant number of patients sought treatment for heart-related conditions under the programme.
Kakar highlighted that efforts to address transparency concerns centered around implementation of a digital supervision and monitoring system. 
“This system aims to enhance accountability by providing real-time updates on resource allocation through a dedicated mobile application, thus deterring potential misuse.”
Further, the issuance of health cards had resulted in reduced fees charged by private doctors, providing relief to economically disadvantaged segments of society. However, the CEO said, there remained a need to expand the programme's scope to ensure that every individual in Balochistan was aware of his/her allocated healthcare resources.
Proposals to improve the programme's efficiency included the establishment of official accounts for timely payments to insurance companies, NADRA, and panel hospitals. 
This measure aimed at ensuring uninterrupted provision of public healthcare services while adhering to legal protocols.
Despite the ongoing challenges, the Balochistan Health Card Programme shows promise in transforming healthcare accessibility. 
With continued refinement and expansion, Kakar said, it had the potential to positively impact the lives of countless individuals across Balochistan.
