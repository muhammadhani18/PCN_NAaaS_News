1,Webinar discusses economic reforms,"Experts urge inclusive implementation, broader tax base & political maturity","A webinar on the subject ‘The Prospects of Charter of Economy for the new government and the new IMF deal’ was held in Islamabad with several prominent economists and experts in attendance.
The event was organised by the Devcom (Development Communications Network) Pakistan and DTN to discuss an inclusive political economy that speakers emphasised should be the top priority of the Pakistan government without any political fiddling by any of the stakeholders.
They underscored the need of the hour for politicians to sit in the parliament, do the legislation and ensure its implementation in letter as well as spirit.
They further instructed that whatever party comes into power should limit the federal ministries count to ten. Then ministers should pass on the vision and mandate to the teams of the technocrats as they know their job well. The performance of the governments world over depends on the technocrats based on ‘right person for the right job’.
Some expressed the notion that the IMF is not a villain, but a fiscal regulator. Which means that the government will need to comply with its proposed measures and take them accordingly. All the political parties and other stakeholders should come together to handle the budget deficit and increase tax base to get rid of the subsidies and reduce state expenses.

They advised that shrinking the bureaucracy and implementation of civil service reforms is a must to reduce burden on the national exchequer. The sluggishness and red-tapism, which they called the hallmark of Pakistan’s bureaucracy should be let go off. The other issue is the politics of agitation that should come to an end.
They also talked of the public’s role in discouraging any protest legislations that would serve vested interests of politicians.
Speaking at the webinar, political activist Dr Nasir Khilji said that all the stakeholders of the country have to take the responsibility of inclusive economic reforms and their true implementation.
He said that the reforms should include a comprehensive strategy to handle the budget deficit and reduce the nonproductive and operational costs. He added that Pakistan has to broaden its tax, wipe off subsidies and reduce the financial burden of bureaucracy that produces hurdles only.
Dr Khilji emphasised that major surgery is required for Pakistan’s entire financial management and governance system. “It is not possible without having all the stakeholders on the same page. They have to come on the same page if they care about 250 million people,” he said.
“Pakistan is a library of recommendations but no implementation of any proposed frameworks,” he further added.

2,Wildlife population dwindles in Chakwal,Deforestation and increased pollution endanger rare species of city and forest areas,"The wildlife of Chakwal city and its surrounding forests is dying owing to deforestation, construction work in the city and especially, due to the act of illegal hunting.
The diverse range of wild animals that were previously able to be spotted close to the city, such as foxes, jackals, hares, snakes and wild cats that roamed the city are now rarely seen. The bats and fireflies that appeared at night have also seemed to all but disappear.
The pollution being caused by the harmful smoke emitted by brick kilns has increased to an extent that even the bee population of Chakwal has declined. Not a single bee can be found in the areas at a distance of 10 to 15 kilometres from the city.
Another reason for the dwindling wildlife population is the construction of expansive housing societies for which large swathes of the forest area have to be cut down. Construction work and growing human settlements also mean that the environment is polluted, and animals no longer have access to clean air, food or water sources. These conditions force animals to either succumb to death or migrate to remote areas.
It used to be that animals were able to find leftover, discarded food remnants, such as meat scraps, and remains of fish and chicken around the city. However, since there’s been an increase in the commercial trade, animal remains including animal fat, intestines, bones, feathers and all kinds of waste are being sold to various industries which use it as raw material. The practice of burying animal remains in deep pits within the ground after they have been slaughtered for consumption, also cuts off wild animals’ and birds’ access to food sources.
Aside from starving to death, the increase in the city’s population and private vehicles has also led to a greater number of street cats being fatally hit by cars. Many animals survive by sticking to the few patches of tree groves and vines that are found around the city.
The challenge of wildlife being threatened in the area due to pollution and problems caused by human activity must be addressed before the problem escalates further. It is the district administrations and organisations that work for wildlife health’s duty to take necessary action.
However, responsibility also falls on civilians, and on both small and large meat sellers to dispose of animal remains in distant areas, where wild animals can feed on them.
In addition to the ongoing threats to wildlife in Chakwal, another pressing concern is the loss of habitat and food sources for the remaining animal populations.

3,Rawalpindi admin urges citizens not to fly kites,"Over 356 kite flyers, sellers rounded up nearly 48,000 kites and 800 string rolls were recovered from their possession","The Rawalpindi district administration and police have urged citizens to ensure that their children do not violate the ban on kite flying imposed by the provincial government.

The spokesperson said on the special directives of City Police Officer Syed Khalid Hamdani, police were taking strict action under the law. The CPO had requested the parents to stop their children from getting involved in such activities as a crackdown against kite flyers had already been accelerated in the city, he added.
Special squads had been formed to net the violators while deputy superintendents of police and station house officers were also taking part in the operation. He said that the officers concerned had been directed to utilise all available resources to control the kite flying and to net the ban violators and the kite sellers.

5,Industries face action for toxic wastes,Sources say flour mills and pharma units lack sewage treatment plants in Rawalpindi,"The Environment Protection Department (EPD) Punjab has found water waste in around 90% of industries substandard and 300 flour mills and the majority of pharmaceutical units without wastewater treatment plants in Rawalpindi district.
In the first phase, the EPD concluded the sampling and laboratory tests of wastewater from 67 major industries in the district.
Field officials are now starting to collect sewage samples from all industries, flour mills, and pharmaceutical companies in all six districts of Rawalpindi division after the presence of toxic chemicals in underground water and Soan River was confirmed in laboratory tests.
The department has decided to enforce the installation of wastewater treatment plants in all industries of the division.
This toxic water is not only harming the healthy soil, but it’s also causing harm to the aquatic animals. The use of chemical-contaminated sewage water is further poisoning vegetables, fruits and crops.
The department has established that the flour mills in Rawalpindi district have been contaminating water for the last 20 to 40 years and causing illnesses.
Beginning on March 1, the EPD has also approved the sampling of wastewater being released by pharmaceutical companies in the Rawalpindi district. It is revealed that wastewater treatment plants were not installed in the majority of pharmaceutical units, while those factories having these plants use them for demonstration purposes only.
The wastewater sampling of industries in the Attock district will be completed by Feb 29, while sampling of multiple industries in the districts of Chakwal, Talagang and Jhelum, which begins in the first week of March, will be completed by March 31.

The EPD will initiate legal action against the industries whose samples are found substandard and they fail to install sewage treatment plants. In the first phase, notices will be served to all factories and responses will be sought. Subsequently, if their answers are unsatisfactory, they [industrial units] will be served with final show-cause notices.
Cases will be further sent to the Punjab Environmental Tribunal. After hearing cases, the tribunal can impose a fine ranging from Rs100,000 to Rs1 million sealing the units or can impose both penalties.
When contacted, senior research officer laboratory at the EPD, Amin Baig told The Express Tribune that the wastewater sampling of industries is in progress in Rawalpindi division. He said that the companies release substandard and hazardous chemical-mixed water into the Saon River, which then flows into other rivers.
Due to the constant release of toxic chemicals into the water, it is becoming a threat to the aquatic life in the rivers, Amin, said, adding the same water is also used for irrigation purposes.
He said that the department would complete division-wide sampling by March 31 before pursuing stern legal action against the violators. The field staff of Rawalpindi district has been provided final reports for pursuing legal procedures, the official added.
Amin said that this year the department would fully focus on the installation of wastewater treatment plants by the industries, and ensure that the discharge of water from factories is per environmental standards.

6,Shopping festival dazzles capital,"Highlighting women-owned brands, Mashion Bazaar wraps up after two days of fun activities","Adding to the string of festivals that took place in the federal capital, the Mashion Bazaar came to a close on Feb 19, Sunday after hosting two days of vibrant activities for Islamabad’s residents.
The Mashion Bazaar is a shopping festival featuring women-owned, home-based ventures or brands targeting women. This was the first time that the festival came to Islamabad as it was previously only held in Karachi and Lahore.
The line-up of stalls at the event included niche brands which mainly operate through social media engagement and sales. The items showcased at the event ranged from home decor and fashion accessories to skin care products. The event also had a dedicated food area with a variety of food vendors offering festival snacks.
The festival also included other activities such as fun photo op installations and a punching bag site that allowed visitors a go at releasing their stress.
Each evening closed with musical performances by celebrated artists such as the musical band AUR, Taha G and Izzchughtai. The festival was a star-studded event as aside from the performing artists, many celebrities including Uzair Jaswal and Merub Ali were also spotted at the shopping fair.

The festival ran for two days with visitors flocking to the event even on the second day despite the persistent overcast and rainy weather. However, most festivalgoers seemed to gravitate towards the food section as the selection of items for sale at the bazaar was on the pricier side.
Talking to The Express Tribune, a visitor, who identified herself as Sana, said: “It seems like an event for the elite since on top of the pricey entry tickets, the products are just too expensive and do not cater to the general public.”
Another visitor, Yahya, on the other hand, found the festival to be “the best out of all food festivals until now since the atmosphere was very pleasant and the environment that they had set up was quite well-arranged.”
The festival seemed to have more success with younger visitors who were attending just to enjoy the festival, eating snacks and vibing to the music.
The event was held in The Rock Musicarium grounds situated within the Naval Sailing Club, making it a rather exclusive event set at some distance from the main city.
Mashion Bazaar is organised by the culture and lifestyle digital platform, Mashion which is run by renowned actor Mahira Khan.

8,Provisional budget ends on Feb 29,Sparks fears of financial crisis before new govt takes the reins,"The provisional budget of Punjab for the fiscal year 2023-24 is set to expire on February 29, sparking fears of a financial crisis in the province.
The development has posed a significant challenge to the bureaucracy.
According to sources, failure to form a new Punjab government before the deadline will render the use of government funds illegal starting March 1. Currently, all development funds and special expenditure funds are in a state of suspension.
Except for salaries, no funds can be utilised without specific approval from the chief minister. Even the disbursement of salaries on March 1 is anticipated to encounter difficulties.
As per constitutional provisions, a caretaker government is restricted to presenting an interim budget for a maximum of four months.

Read Uncertainty looms over K-P’s budget
The interim budget for Punjab was initially presented by the caretaker government in June 2023, covering the period from July 1 to October 31.
Upon the end of the date, the Punjab cabinet once again introduced a fresh interim budget for the subsequent four months, spanning from November 1, 2023, to February 29, 2024.
This second interim budget is poised to expire at midnight on February 29, making all expenditures unlawful in Punjab thereafter.
To address this looming crisis, the finance ministry has suggested the presentation of a third interim budget for four months to the caretaker government. Approval for this budget is contingent upon the consent of the Punjab cabinet and the caretaker chief minister.
This proposal aims to provide the newly formed Punjab government with an opportunity to present a budget aligned with the party's policy in June.

9,IHC nixes PML-N wins in Islamabad,"Court suspends victory notifications for NA-46, NA-47 and NA-48 seats","The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday suspended the victory notifications of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidates from the three Islamabad National Assembly (NA) constituencies.
A two-member division bench comprising Justice Mian Gul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir suspended the notification of the success of Anjum Aqeel Khan from NA-46, Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhary from NA 47, Raja Khurram Shahzad Nawaz from NA-48.
During the hearing of intra-court appeals filed by Aamir Mughal, Shoaib Shaheen Advocate and Ali Bukhari against the election results, Shoaib Shaheen advocate said that he received around 380 Forms 45 that night.
He alleged that his [Shoaib] vote was being cast for Tariq Fazal and vice versa. “I barely could access the Returning Officer (RO) and asked him for correcting the mistake. To which the RO hastily asked me to leave or he will be kicked out of room.”
Shoaib Shaheen, who was PTI-backed candidate, informed the court that Form 45 was not being issued till 1am, so they staged a sit-in.
Justice Mian Gul Hasan Aurangzeb inquired whether the RO’s signature there on Form 45. Shoaib confirmed the signature and said that he first submitted an application to the RO and then to the District Returning Officer (DRO).

The complainant further informed the court that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) then issued an order to the RO to stop the final consolidation and sought a report within three days, but it has not been submitted yet.
The RO, who prepares Form 48 in the presence of all candidates, refused to issue final consolidation citing the ECP’s directive. Shoiab told the court that they later came to know that the RO was indulged in tampering at his office in the presence of candidate Tariq Fazal Chaudhry.
“When we reached the RO office there, were were not allowed to enter. The ECP later issued a notification without consolidation despite our written plea,” Shoaib further pleaded.
He further said accepting his request, the IHC had ordered the conduct of entire process again.
If the electoral watchdog has withdrawn the notification of the successful candidate from the Lahore’s NA constituency of advocate Salman Akram Raja, the notifications of successful candidates of their constituencies also be withdrawn, Shoaib Shaeen pleaded.
The court then suspended the notification of the victory of the candidates of the three constituencies.
The court’s decision follows intra-court appeals filed against the election results.
