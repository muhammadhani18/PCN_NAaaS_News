0,Global collaboration for food security stressed,Foreign scientist highlights disparity in wheat productivity,"Foreign agricultural scientists have stressed the need for collaboration to enhance work on climate resilient, high yielding and fortified varieties of crops to ensure food and nutrition security amid the challenges of increasing population and inadequate productivity. 
Addressing the inaugural session of a two-day international conference hosted by the University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF), Vice Chancellor Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan said there was a huge gap between the productivity of progressive and traditional farmers. 
“We have to promote modern trends in order to raise the per acre productivity,“ he added.
He said the country imported wheat, whereas 10 per cent in the average productivity could make it self-sufficient. 
He said the UAF was developing climate-resilient wheat varieties in collaboration with the Washington State University.
The US Kansas State University Wheat Genetics Resources Centre’s Founding Director Dr Bikram Singh Gill called for utilising plant breeding to cope with climate changes. 
He said that centre's gene bank, which maintains more than 5,000 wheat genetics stocks, offers opportunities for researchers to quickly improve crop yield, quality and food security.
Scientist Dr Kulvinder Singh Gill from the Washington State University said the world's record of maximum wheat production is 17 tonnes per hectare, while the average production is limited to three tonnes. The maximum yield of rice is 22 tonnes and the average only four tonnes.

He said that in his project, high yielding varieties of heat tolerant germplasm from the heat stressed areas were collected and their field trials had been conducted in Pakistan, India, Nepal and Egypt. 
He said field trials of new varieties were also being carried out at the UAF, which were expected to yield positive results.
Dr Richard Trerthowan from Sydney University briefed the participants about achieving higher yields of wheat. 
He said a hybrid variety with enhanced yield requires fewer inputs
and produces more nutritious grain.
Dr Alex Johnson from
the University of Melbourne said two billion people in the world are suffering from iron deficiency, whereas deficiency of zinc and other essential nutrients is also widespread. 
He said he was collaborating with UAF researchers to explore the potential of genetically modified wheat. 
Islamic Organisation for Food Security’s Programme and Projects Director Dr Zulfiqar Ali said only seven of the 57 OIC countries are meeting the food security goals. 
In 2019, the OIC
countries were facing a food deficit worth $65 billion, while low hanging food worth $300 billion went waste due to lack of processing and other factors. 
An expert from Tajikistan also attended the conference.

1,Harassment culture plagues driving test centres,"Root cause of problem lies in society’s preconceived, sexist notion that all women were bad drivers","“There must be a lady behind the wheel in that car.” For the typical Pakistani driver maneuvering through bumpy roads and jam-packed avenues, the aforesaid adage is the default reaction to any untoward encounter, be it a wrongly parked car, a sluggish vehicle blocking the way, or an unavoidable fender bender. While such misogynistic attitudes generally work well at keeping women from taking the driving seat, even the few who dare to defy the odds are covertly driven away, courtesy, the underreported harassment culture plaguing driving test centers.
Even though discrimination against female drivers is a universal manifestation of sexism, with a plethora of jokes and memes existing in almost all cultures around the world, most developed nations have to some degree invested in improving women’s participation in the public sphere by enforcing strict anti-harassment laws.
In Pakistan however, sexist outlooks towards female drivers having seemingly seeped into state institutions like the Traffic Police, which despite claiming to be gender inclusive, have failed to curtail the display of sexually offensive gestures by male onlookers, who harass and intimidate female drivers during their maneuvering assessments thereby preventing them from passing the test and obtaining a license.
“Whenever a woman is taking a maneuvering assessment, male test takers who are waiting for their turn, gather around and start hooting and ogling at the female driver. As a result of the bullying, many women get confused and are unable to pass the tricky test,” revealed Madiha Qasim, a test taker.

Madiha’s revelation was supported by records obtained by The Express Tribune, which revealed that more than 50 percent of the women taking a driving test under the supervision of the Traffic Police, failed the maneuvering assessment are were thus unable to obtain a license.
According to Dr Mehwish Zafar, a psychologist, such poor performance is a natural result of the harassment culture at driving test centers, which pressurizes women psychologically and negatively impacts their performance on the test.
“Harassment is a major source of stress. The trauma of harassment hampers the woman’s ability to focus on the driving test. It is well understood that when a person does not focus on what they are doing, their performance is poor,” explained Dr Mehwish, who further implored the government to actively deal with such cases, in order to improve women’s chances of passing the driving test and obtaining a license.
Shedding light on the broader culture of discrimination against female drivers, Amina Malik, a social activist and lawyer opined that the root cause of the problem lied in the society’s preconceived, sexist notion that all women were bad drivers. ”Therefore, when a woman is driving on the road, male drivers nearby will try to intimidate her through hand gestures or demeaning phrases. 
Similarly, when a woman wants to obtain a license, she is harassed by onlookers during the test,” asserted Malik, who further alleged that as a result of such misogynistic attitudes towards female drivers, a large population of women above the age of 18 did not have a driver’s license.
Denying Malik’s speculation, Amara Athar, City Traffic Officer at the Lahore Traffic Police maintained that women were treated on a priority basis across driving test centers in Lahore. “100 to 150 women receive driving licenses everyday at our centers. While no separate center for women’s traffic licensing exists in the city, female officers are available at all centers, which are open 24/7,” claimed Amara.

A senior provincial health official told The Express Tribune that around 90% of the pneumonia patients were children. The official also complained of lack of effective steps by the authorities to cope with the issue. He said the response of the authorities concerned had been limited to convening meetings and issuing statements rather than taking action to address the plight of the patients.
“The weather in Punjab has again turned cold and the parents should take care of the health of the children and protect them from low temperature,” Mayo Hospital’s Senior Medical officer Dr Ghulam Fareed said.
He called for special care of newborn babies and their timely vaccination.

5,Gang war claims another life,Balaj Tipu shot dead at wedding ceremony,"The longstanding feud spanning over three decades between two prominent underworld families of the walled city has taken a deadly turn yet again, with Khawaja Aqeel alias Gogi Butt and Khawaja Tareef alias Teefi Butt now implicated in an FIR related to the murder of 32-year-old Ameer Balaj Tipu.
The incident occurred at a private housing society in Chung, where Balaj was attending the wedding of his childhood friend's younger brother. Suddenly, he was fatally shot by an unidentified assailant.
This attack adds another chapter to the history of violence between the two families. Balaj's father, Arif Amir alias Tipu Truckanwala, was murdered in 2010 at the Allama Iqbal International Airport parking lot, with Gogi and Teefi Butt allegedly behind the orchestration of the crime. Khuram Butt, serving a life sentence for the murder, was identified as the shooter.
Balaj himself had survived numerous attempts on his life, including an attack outside the civil courts in Lahore, where he sustained severe injuries and lost five of his guards.
The Butt brothers, along with former inspector Abid Boxer, were accused in this incident as well.
Tragically, Ameer Balaj's grandfather, Ameerul Din alias Billa Truckanwala, also fell victim to the ongoing feud when he was shot dead outside his residence in Shah Alam Market.
The recent attack on Balaj occurred as guests were departing from the wedding ceremony. The assailant, pretending to take a selfie, pulled out a gun and fired at Balaj, who was surrounded by guards, friends, and hosts. Despite efforts to defend themselves, Balaj sustained fatal injuries along with others present.
