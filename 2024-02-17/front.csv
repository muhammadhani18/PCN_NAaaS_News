0,Political landscape: Indecision mars parties a week after inconclusive vote,"PML-N wavers on coalition at Centre, convenes another meeting today to firm up plans","A week after the electoral showdown, the political battleground on Friday seemed anything but settled with major political players caught in second-guessing, leaving the formation of a central government hanging in the balance.
PML-N, initially eying a coalition federal government alongside the PPP and the MQM-P, appeared to be indecisive while the PTI, lacking the numerical muscle for a government takeover, hinted at finding comfort on the opposition benches.
Meanwhile, the PML-N reconsidered its plans on Friday, mulled over the consequences of making a coalition federal government and limited itself to Punjab.
In a meeting at Jati Umra, which was chaired by PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, the party leadership advised that the PML-N shouldn’t take the federal government and focus only on Punjab where it can easily form the government. They also said that the party shouldn’t accept unreasonable demands of any political party for the sake of forming government in the Centre.
The party leaders also said that the only purpose of forming a federal government was to save the country and the state from sliding further into political and economic crises.
Nevertheless, certain members raised concerns about the feasibility of the country's governance in the absence of any party taking the initiative to lead at the national level. They argued that the PML-N should not withdraw from consideration if no other party is capable of forming a federal government.
A tweet stating that Nawaz chaired the meeting called to contemplate if the PML-N should form government in the Center and Punjab has already taken some crucial decisions. The tweet, which was retweeted by PML-N-nominated chief minister in Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, added that the committee earlier formed to reach out to the PPP and other parties gave a briefing to Nawaz and some more important decisions were expected soon.
The decisions can be expected after a scheduled meeting between the PML-N and the PPP’s committees on Saturday evening. The committees, earlier constituted to finalise conditions on which both the parties would move ahead, had to meet on Friday but due to the PML-N meeting, it was postponed till Saturday.
The committees were formed after PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had announced that his party would vote for the PML-N’s candidate for the Prime Minister’s slot but wouldn’t become a part of the federal government.
Bilawal, however, had unequivocally conveyed that the officer of Presidency should be given to his father and PPP president, Asif Ali Zardari.
In the two rounds that have already been held between the two sides, the PPPP has stuck to the party line so far as it hasn’t asked for any portfolios but demanded key constitutional offices like the presidency, chairman senate and speaker of National Assembly’s positions. The PPP committee has already briefed Bilawal about the multilateral contact among political parties.
Some other factors contributing to political uncertainty include JUI-F’s Maulana Fazlur Rehman decision not to support the PML-N and even asking it to sit on the opposition benches. The thaw in the JUI-F and the PTI relations after a PTI delegation approached Maulana to seek support for the protest against the alleged rigging has also forced parties to reconsider their strategies.
In November 2019, PML-Q’s President Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain warned that no one would want to become the prime minister of the country after three months due to rampant inflation and unemployment. Given the current situation, it seems his prophecy has come true.
Before polls, it was envisaged that elections would lead to political stability but the split mandate has created a situation where political parties are still navigating the unchartered waters and busy in wheeling & dealing. Political observers believe that uncertainty seems to be the only certainty at the moment.
Nevertheless, the PTI, while dialling up its allegations of rigging and deciding to hit the streets, made it clear that it won’t be pulling a disappearing act from parliament.
It asserted that it would not abandon the parliament by replicating its en masse resignations after the ex-premier Imran Khan was ousted through a vote of no-confidence in April 2022.
PTI officials told The Express Tribune that even if their candidate, Omar Ayub, fails to clinch the parliamentary vote for the premier's slot, the party is here to stay in the parliamentary arena.
Meanwhile, PTI leader Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif announced that following the instructions of PTI founder Imran Khan the party has decided to sit in opposition both at the Centre and in the province of Punjab.
When approached, PTI information secretary Raoof Hasan said that PTI will not abandon parliament, adding that a formal statement will be issued in this regard on Saturday (today).

1,PTI stage countrywide protests against poll ‘rigging’,"Party wants Punjab, Sindh top officials sacked as Salman Raja arrested in Lahore","The PTI on Saturday demanded the immediate dismissal of the Punjab and Sindh chief secretaries as well as the police chiefs of both the provinces for “facilitating electoral fraud” and “assisting in robbing” the mandate of the people.
According to the PTI’s central media department, the senior leadership of the party has sought the removal of these four officials as they have played a “criminal role in tarnishing democracy and promoting lawlessness” in their provinces.
It added that the PTI’s senior leadership wanted these four officials to be held “sternly accountable” for their “actions”.
As per its plan, the PTI earlier in the day staged protest rallies in various cities of the country including Islamabad and Lahore against alleged rigging the results of the recently held general elections but those in the provincial capital of Punjab faced the wrath of police, especially party leader Salman Akram Raja.
In Lahore, the police launched a crackdown on the rally and arrested dozens of protesters including PTI-backed independent candidate lawyer Raja for NA-128 as well as several women.
Surrounded by security and media personnel, Raja said he stood ""with the people of Pakistan"" and he was “illegally” being arrested as the police dragged him towards their vehicle.
However, taking to social media platform X, Punjab caretaker Information Minister Amir Mir claimed that Raja and some other “miscreants” had been set free after being detained briefly.

But in response, lawyer Sameer Khosa shared on X that Raja's family had not heard or seen from him yet, adding that they were filing a habeas corpus petition in the high court.
The protesters in the countrywide rallies included men, women and a large number of youngsters.
The youth waved PTI flags and chanted slogans against “rigging”.
In Islamabad, a protest rally was led by PTI’s Sher Afzal Marwat. The PTI Islamabad had sought permission from the deputy commissioner to stage the rally, but it was turned down and Section-144 imposed in the federal capital.
However, the party went ahead with its protest in any case.
The rally kicked off from F-9 Park and culminated outside the National Press Club before coming to an end.
Shoaib Shaheen, Seemabia Tahir, Shehryar Riaz and other PTI leaders participated in the rally as well.
Addressing the participants of the rally, Marwat said the resignation of the Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chatha had exposed how despicable people had stolen the mandate of the people.
Earlier in the day, Chatha claimed that the results of the February 8 general elections were “manipulated” under his watch and they had caused the independent candidates, who were leading by “thousands of votes”, to lose by using “fake stamps”. He also stepped down from his post.
Other PTI leaders also spoke on the occasion.

In Balochistan, four nationalist political parties -- the BNP-M, PkMAP, National Party, and Hazara Democratic Party have vowed to carry on their protests in Quetta and other cities as well as town of the province against alleged rigging in the elections.
The four-party alliance has called for a wheel-jam strike across Balochistan on Sunday (today).
They also set up a joint protest camp to mount pressure on the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to reexamine its results about their constituencies.
“People from all walks of life and political activists have rejected the results of the general polls not only in Balochistan, but in other parts of the country as well,” said PkMAP secretary general Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal.
He added that the returning officers had snatched their democratic right.
The PkMAP leader blamed the ROs and ECP for the “record polls rigging: in the province.

2,Shocking ‘revelation’ sends shockwaves through country,Pindi commissioner confesses to allowing poll rigging,"In a shocking ‘revelation’ that sent shockwaves through the political landscape, Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chatha on Saturday dropped a bombshell, confessing to his role in rigging the recent Pakistan elections, a week after polls marred by allegations of manipulation returned no clear winner.
Taking responsibility for what he termed a ""heinous crime,"" Chatha implicated not only himself but also pointed fingers at the head of the election commission and the country's top judge – thrusting them into the spotlight.
The ‘confessions’ came as the ECP has already been in the crosshairs of several rigging allegations in the aftermath of a tumultuous week and thick clouds of manipulation continue to linger over results, throwing further questions over the legitimacy of the ballots.
Chatha, in a stunning admission, announced his intention to surrender to the authorities, acknowledging his role in tampering with the electoral outcome by turning the tables and flipping losers into winners.
""We converted the losers into winners, reversing margins of 70,000 votes in 13 national assembly seats,"" he told reporters.
""For committing such a heinous crime, I will hand myself over to the police,"" he said, also implicating Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikander Sultan Raja and Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa.
In a handwritten letter, he expressed his decision to resign from his ""post and service,"" citing his ""deep involvement in serious crimes like mega election rigging 2024.""
The letter was directed to Punjab Governor Haji Ghulam Ali, interim provincial chief minister Mohsin Naqvi, and the provincial chief secretary.
When questioned about potential ""irregularities"" in the electoral process and whether local returning officers had caused delays in result transmission, Chatha stated that ""'irregularities' is a minor word for it.""
The commissioner further emphasised that the act of ""stabbing the country in its back"" keeps him awake at night.
""I should face punishment for the injustice I have committed, and others involved in this injustice should also be held accountable,"" he added.
During a press conference at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, Chatha disclosed that there was significant ""pressure"" on him, to the extent that he contemplated suicide in the morning but ultimately decided to bring the matter before the public.
""It is my appeal to the entire bureaucracy not to engage in any wrongful actions for these political figures,"" he concluded.

Newly-appointed commissioner refutes rigging claims
Meanwhile, in the wake of allegations made by his predecessor, the newly appointed commissioner, Saif Anwar Jappa, along with all five District Returning Officers (DROs) in the division, vehemently refuted the claims and urged a transparent inquiry by the ECP.
In a press conference held at the Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner's Office, Jappa asserted that the role of a commissioner primarily involves coordination and not interference in elections.
He said that the 2024 elections were conducted transparently, dismissing all accusations made by his predecessor.
DRO Rawalpindi Hassan Waqar Cheema echoed Jappa, declaring, ""We have ensured the transparency of the election. We reject all allegations and call for a thorough investigation into the matter.""
Similarly, DRO Attock Rao Atif Raza insisted that the elections in Attock were conducted transparently without any external pressure. He rejected the allegations put forth by the former commissioner.
DRO Jhelum Captain (retd) Sami denied the accusations, stating that he conducted the elections in accordance with his predecessor, maintaining cleanliness and transparency throughout the process.
Meanwhile, DRO Chakwal emphasised adherence to the Election Act during the elections in Chakwal and urged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to conduct an impartial investigation into the allegations.
Khawar Bashir, DRO of the fifth district of Talagang in Rawalpindi Division, asserted the transparency of the elections in Talagang and called for an independent investigation into the allegations made by the former commissioner.
It is pertinent to note that as the controversy unfolds, the Election Commission of Pakistan has been urged by political parties and others to take swift action to address the concerns raised and ensure the credibility of the electoral process.
However, the election commission has rejected Chattha's allegations, but said in a statement that it would ""hold an enquiry"".
Leading advocacy group the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said after Chattha's announcement that the ""involvement of the state bureaucracy in rigging in Pakistan is beginning to be exposed.
Candidates from the PML-N and PPP claimed most of the seats in Rawalpindi, sweeping aside candidates loyal to jailed former prime minister Imran Khan -- the target of a sweeping crackdown.
Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party called nationwide protests against the alleged rigging on Saturday.
A small number of supporters took to the streets in major urban centres, with the largest gathering of around 4,000 people in its stronghold northern city of Peshawar.
In the central city of Lahore, police detained senior party member Salman Akram Raja and around a dozen supporters -- surrounding the party headquarters -- but said they had all been released by late afternoon.
Senior PTI official Ali Muhammad Khan said after the protests that Chattha's statement proved his party was cheated.
""We must be returned our mandate,"" he told reporters in Islamabad.
PTI defied a months-long crackdown that shattered its campaigning and forced candidates to run as independents, gaining more votes than any other party.
But it has been unwilling to enter a coalition with its opponents, paving the way for PML-N to form the next government.(With Input from AFP)

3,"CJ, CEC brush off rigging allegations",SC opts to keep its hands off accusations; ECP forms high-level probing panel,"In the eye of a political tempest sparked by the Rawalpindi commissioner, Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikander Sultan Raja on Saturday defended themselves against the allegations while shrugging off the ""baseless accusations"".
Moreover, the ECP, in a late night meeting, decided to form a high-level committee to investigate the Rawalpindi commissioner’s allegations.
The chief justice said that tossing them around without a shred of truth or evidence ""doesn't carry any weightage,"" while the CEC formed a high-level meeting.
The remarks came hours after Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chatha kicked up a political storm, claiming that the chief election commissioner and the chief justice were “also completely involved” in alleged election rigging.
In a casual interaction with media personnel in Islamabad on Saturday, the CJP said: “Someone can blame me for theft or murder tomorrow. If hurling allegations is your right, give me evidence along with it too.”
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court opted to keep its hands off the allegations of election rigging hurled by the Rawalpindi commissioner at CJP Isa, deciding against taking suo motu notice.
Reliable sources told Express News on Saturday that this decision was reached after a consultation among the judges, including CJP Isa, himself.
The allegations, which involve CJP Isa’s purported involvement in poll rigging, were expected to be deliberated upon during a scheduled hearing in an election-related case on February 19.
Sources suggested that there is a possibility of the Rawalpindi Commissioner's case being considered within the framework of this pre-arranged case.
A consultation meeting chaired by CJP Isa was reportedly convened to address the accusations made by the Rawalpindi Commissioner.
Justices Muneeb Akhtar, Yahya Afridi, Ayesha Malik, and Athar Minallah were also present during the deliberations. Following a careful examination of the allegations, the participants decided against taking suo motu notice on the matter.

ECP forms probing committee
The ECP decided to establish a high-level committee to investigate the rigging allegations.
Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikander Sultan Raja called for an emergency meeting of the ECP following the serious allegations made by Chattha.
In a press release following the meeting, the ECP disclosed that the allegations were thoroughly discussed, leading to the decision to form a committee headed by a senior member of the commission to scrutinise the claims.
The committee will also include the secretary, special secretary, and additional director general of the law department, as outlined in the statement.
“The committee will take statements from Rawalpindi’s District Returning Officers (DROs) and Returning Officers (ROs) and is expected to submit a report to the commission within three days of being notified,” the statement detailed.
The ECP further specified that based on the committee’s findings, legal action and contempt of ECP proceedings might be initiated against the former commissioner.
Earlier in the day, the electoral watchdog commission refuted the allegations made by Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha against the chief election commissioner and the ECP.
“No official from the ECP issued any instructions to Commissioner Rawalpindi to manipulate election results,” stated the release issued soon after the commissioner’s press conference.
“It is important to note that the commissioner of any division is not the DRO, RO, or presiding officer and does not have a direct role in conducting the elections,” it emphasised.
Nevertheless, the electoral watchdog will promptly initiate an inquiry into the matter.

SCBA deeply concerned
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has demanded the election commission conduct a transparent investigation into the allegations.
A statement issued by the SCBA stated that Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha has tried to make the office of chief justice controversial, adding that the CJP has no role in the conduct of the elections.
“Executive Committee of the Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan have expressed deep concern and anguish over the statement issued to the media by the Commissioner Rawalpindi division whereby he tried to involve the Chief Justice of Pakistan in the allegations of rigging in the general elections,” the statement, available with The Express Tribune, read.
It stated that the SCBAP considers the statement of the Commissioner to be a “malicious attempt to raise a controversy qua the esteemed office of the Chief Justice of Pakistan” which is regrettable and intolerable”.
The SCBA noted that it is a matter of common knowledge that neither the SC net the Chief Justice of Pakistan has any concern with the entire electoral process which is within the exclusive domain of the ECP.
“The SCBAP however considers that in the wake of allegations of serious rigging, the matters need to be taken up by the ECP and the same should be fairly inquired into and remedial steps must be taken to address the grievances of the contesting candidates.”
It further pointed out that large-scale allegations qua the integrity and transparency of the election results certainly call for an urgent and thorough investigation which is the constitutional duty of the ECP in terms of Article 218(3) of the Constitution.
The SCBAP urged the ECP to perform its constitutional obligations to take all possible steps to ensure the integrity of the electoral process. In light of these developments, it urged all political parties and stakeholders who feel aggrieved by the election results or alleged rigging to exercise restraint.
“It is essential to prioritise the preservation of democracy and to avoid any actions that could potentially derail the democratic process in the country. Furthermore, the SCBAP is of the view that the importance of adhering to the provisions outlined in the Elections Act of 2017 is essential at this point of time,” the statement said.
Any grievances stemming from election results should be addressed through legal channels and under established election laws/ rules as well as democratic norms. In these critical times, it is essential that the integrity of the electoral process is preserved and, the will of the people is respected so as to uphold democracy and stability in the country.
