0,Bonds rally on Goldman Sachs forecast,Hubco acquires 9.5% stake in SECMC – country’s top coal-rich mine,"Responding to Goldman Sachs’ forecast of a rebound in Pakistan’s US dollar-denominated Eurobond, the leading foreign bond maturing in April 2024, and others maintained an uptrend for the second consecutive working day on Friday. This marks a partial recovery from the approximately 5% decline following the post-election upset.
In a story titled ‘Goldman Sachs sees end to Pakistan bond selloff on IMF prospects’, Bloomberg reported on Thursday that “Goldman Sachs Group Inc says Pakistan’s dollar bonds will rebound, overcoming a fractured election mandate, as the leaders of the emerging coalition understand the gravity of the economic crisis and will work together to secure International Monetary Fund aid.”
According to a local research house, Pakistan’s 10-year Eurobond worth $1 billion, maturing in two months on April 15, 2024, ticked up 0.1% to 97.91 cents on Friday. Pakistan has eight foreign bonds listed globally, totalling $7.8 billion, maturing between April 2024 to April 2051. Three of them, including the leading one, maintained an uptrend, while the remaining five bonds ticked down on Friday.
Bloomberg further stated that the South Asian nation’s bonds rallied Thursday, led by notes maturing in April 2024, after the third-biggest group in the new parliament pledged support for former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to take office again. Sharif, who already has a track record with the IMF, obtained a nine-month, $3 billion programme from the multilateral lender last June. These gains helped offset post-election losses that had reached 5%.
The nation is facing a looming deadline to find the money to meet $25 billion of external debt payments starting July, three times its foreign-exchange reserves. Its inflation rate is the highest in Asia, while the economy contracted last fiscal year. Investors demand an additional 11.5 percentage points of yield over Treasuries to buy the country’s bonds, much above the 10 percentage points seen as the threshold of distress.

The IMF has announced its team will visit Pakistan after the new government forms to discuss a medium-term package. “We do not see any of these stakeholders to be a holdout in the upcoming IMF negotiations,” said Dhiraj Bajaj, lead portfolio manager for Asia and Emerging Markets debt at Lombard Odier, referring to the major political parties tipped to form a new government. “The only way forward to their success to stay in power is an IMF programme, and to then regain bilateral funding and meet their external liabilities. We believe this outcome is good for shorter and mid-dated US dollar bonds for now.”
Pakistan’s dollar bonds delivered some of the best returns in emerging markets last year, gaining over 90%. Goldman analysts cautioned that the outlook for Pakistan’s bonds beyond a short-term rebound will depend on global financial conditions. Investors will weigh the risk of sticky US inflation and a longer wait for Federal Reserve rate cuts, which will act as a drag on all distressed debt, including Pakistan’s, the analysts wrote.
Hubco buys stakes in Thar coal
In a notification to PSX on Friday, the Hub Power Company said it has entered into a “definitive agreement” for the acquisition of shares of Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), equivalent to approximately 9.5% of the issued and paid-up ordinary share capital of SECMC, held by Habib Bank Limited. To recall, the power company had entered into talks of the acquisition in mid-January 2024 to take stake in the country’s top coal-rich mine that is supplying the black gold to run power plants.

1,Rupee dips again amid supply concerns,Falls to Rs281.77/$ in fifth consecutive drop,"The Pakistani currency dropped to Rs281.77 against the US dollar in the open market on Friday, maintaining a downturn for the fifth consecutive working day, potentially leading to further depreciation in the major interbank market.
According to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP), the currency decreased by 0.06% or Rs0.17 on a day-to-day basis in the retail market.
Cumulatively, it has lost 0.27% or Rs0.67 in the past five days. Currency dealers in the open market attribute this downturn to a reduction in the supply of foreign currency. With fewer individuals coming forward to sell foreign currencies there are concerns of volatility in the local currency.
However, the interbank market has defied this declining trend, with the currency remaining largely stable at Rs279.32 against the greenback, showing an increase of Rs0.02 on a day-to-day basis.
The recent uptick in the forex reserves and improvements in export earnings suggest that the supply of foreign currency has remained higher than the prevailing stable demand, supporting the rupee to maintain an uptrend going forward.
In the past five months, the currency has gained almost 10% or Rs27.78 in the interbank market. The downturn in the open market and the upturn in the interbank market have widened the disparity in the value of the rupee between the two markets to Rs2.45 (0.87%).

2,Brief reprieve seen in inflation trend,Decreases 0.78% but gas price hike threatens stability,"The inflation rate in Pakistan showed a slight decrease of 0.78% in the week ending February 15, marking the third consecutive week of decline. However, this downward trend may soon face disruption following the government’s significant increase in gas prices for the second time in three months.
Despite the latest weekly downturn, inflation remains alarmingly high, fuelled by price hikes in essential commodities such as pulses, rice, and potatoes.
Data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics reveals that the inflation rate hit a 12-week low at 34.25% compared to the same period last year. While this marks a slight improvement, inflation has consistently remained above 34% year-on-year, indicating persistent economic challenges.
The recent spike in gas prices, with residential rates rising by up to 67% and a staggering 700% hike for fertiliser manufacturers, threatens to reverse the declining trend. This latest increase, effective from February 1, 2024, is expected to exert further pressure on consumer prices in the coming weeks.
During the reviewed week, prices of 22 out of 51 items witnessed an increase, while 11 items saw a decrease and 18 remained stable, according to PBS data.

Read Inflation to stay at 28.5% despite ‘economic stabilisation’
Notable decreases were observed in the prices of eggs (28.82%), chicken (4.23%), onions (3.48%), and LPG gas (2.85%). Conversely, prices of certain items including potatoes, moong pulse, Basmati rice, and mutton saw significant increases, contributing to the overall inflationary pressures.
The year-on-year trend reflects a 34.25% increase, largely attributed to previous hikes in gas prices and rising costs of essential items.
Despite earlier projections of a slowdown in the second half of the fiscal year, the central bank revised its full-year inflation forecast to 23-25%, citing sustained inflationary pressures from previous gas price hikes and other economic factors.

3,Textile exports surge to $1.46b,"Political uncertainty, gas price hike threaten sectors competitiveness","Textile sector exports for January 2024 soared to $1.46 billion, marking a 3.97% month-on-month increase over December 2023 figures of $1.399 billion. This positive trend in the second consecutive month, however, falls short of the industry’s expectations, given its significant role in Pakistan’s economy.
According to data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, textile exports also saw a year-on-year increase of 10.10%, with January 2023 figures at $1.32 billion. However, the first seven months of fiscal year 2023-24 witnessed a negative growth of 2.99%, dropping from $10.04 billion to $9.72 billion compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.
Analysis of half-year data reveals a decline of 82.89% in the export of raw cotton on a month-on-month basis, with January 2024 figures at $2.34 million compared to $13.7 million in December 2023. Similarly, cotton yarn exports fell by 14.65% to $81.29 million, while cotton cloth exports surged by 11.23% to $159.72 million.

Exports of knitwear saw a marginal decline of 0.46%, amounting to $365.05 million in January 2024. Conversely, the bedwear sector experienced a positive growth of 11.37%, reaching $252.08 million, and towel exports increased by 9.68% to $96.07 million. The readymade garments sector posted a significant growth of 11.69%, amounting to $333.41 million.
Despite hopes for a recovery in the textile sector this year, industry experts remain cautious due to persistent challenges, such as high energy tariffs. The recent general elections in Pakistan brought anticipation for positive economic changes. However, the subsequent split mandate and nationwide protests alleging poll rigging have raised concerns among business communities.
Furthermore, the recent hike in gas prices, from Rs2400/MMBTU to Rs2950/MMBTU, threatens to undermine the competitiveness of Pakistan’s textile sector. Industry insiders fear that this will make it challenging for the sector to compete in regional markets, potentially leading to a downward trend in export figures in the coming months.

4,SBP purchases $2b from market,"Strategic move stabilises rupee-dollar parity, meets IMF targets on NIR","The State Bank of Pakistan has bought over $2 billion from the interbank market in the past seven months aimed at retaining official foreign exchange reserves at their current levels and also offsetting the impact of low disbursements of foreign loans.
The purchases from the market have also helped achieve the targets set by the International Monetary Fund regarding the net international reserves (NIR) requirements and the forward swaps, according to the sources in the central bank.
Despite major buying from the market, the rupee-dollar parity largely remained stable with the local currency strengthening to around Rs279 to a dollar.
The central bank avoids responding to questions about the sale and purchase of foreign currency.
The sources said that the major purchases were made during the past few months, which have offset the impact of the shrinking window of external borrowings. Had these purchases not been made, the foreign currency reserves would have slipped to below $6 billion, and the rupee started depreciating, said the central bank sources.
The sources said that the SBP has met the IMF target of lowering the forward swap position to $3.45 billion by the end of December. These short-term borrowings by the central bank remained at $3.42 billion, slightly better than the IMF’s maximum ceiling for the first half, the sources added.
They said that the central bank was also comfortable against another IMF target of NIR. The global lender has set the condition that the government’s net reserves should not be negative by more than $13.4 billion in the first half of the fiscal year.
The IMF’s projection of keeping the gross official foreign exchange reserves to $8.2 billion by the end of December has also been met. The reserves remained at $8.3 billion by end-December.
All this was possible mainly because of buying the dollars from the market, as the federal government struggled to materialise the planned foreign loans inflows.
During the first half of Pakistan, the federal government repaid $3.2 billion foreign debt and also secured the rollovers of another $4 billion from Saudi Arabia and China. Despite these payments, Pakistan’s external debt and liabilities again increased to $131.2 billion by end-December, according to the central bank data.
Pakistan is now trying to secure a rollover of $2 billion Chinese debt maturing on March 23rd. The country’s current reserves position does not support making these payments, and there is no option but to get the loans rolled over again.
Three weeks ago, Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar wrote a letter to Li Qiang, the Chinese premier, requesting him to rollover the debt, according to the finance ministry officials. Pakistan is paying a 7.1% interest rate on this $2 billion Chinese loan.

Read IMF loan uncertainty very high
Another loan payment of $1 billion on account of Eurobond is maturing in mid-April that cannot be rolled over.
The IMF has assumed the average exchange rate at Rs300 to a dollar by June – an assumption that is unlikely to be true if the central bank keeps buying the dollars from the market to cushion the reserves.
The IMF said earlier that the wedge between the interbank and open market exchange rates has narrowed, and the money markets have adequate liquidity. Reforms of exchange companies introduced in early September, coupled with measures against illegal foreign exchange activities, also helped improve market sentiments and liquidity, according to the IMF report.
The last IMF report had also stated that on the back of disbursements by the international financial institutions and continued SBP purchases, gross reserves further increased. However, despite the relative increase in the level of the foreign exchange reserves, the cushion was hardly sufficient to back 1.4 months of imports.
During the first seven months of the fiscal year, the country had booked a trade deficit of $19.6 billion on the back of a 14% reduction in imports. The imports during this period remained at $36 billion as against $16.5 billion of exports.
Since June 2019, Pakistan has adopted a market-based flexible exchange rate system, where the exchange rate is determined by market demand and supply conditions. But there have been incidents since June 2019 when the central bank also pumped dollars to stabilise the exchange rate during the period of uncertainty.
The higher purchases and meeting the external sector-related targets may help completion of the next programme review that carries the bonanza of the $1.2 billion loan tranche. However, the IMF is keen to negotiate the last tranche with an elected government.
An early formation of the government and timely announcement of the new finance minister would help secure the date for the next review talks from the IMF.
The finance ministry has not been able to ensure inflows of $6 billion on account of Eurobonds and foreign commercial loans. The data reported by the Economic Affairs Division and the central bank showed that Pakistan secured $8.1 billion in foreign loans during the first six months of the fiscal year, which was equal to one-third of the downward revised annual requirements.
Pakistan has also secured $5 billion rollovers from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, taking total external sector inflows to $13.1 billion or 52% of its needs.

5,Political turmoil sends PSX plunging 2%,"KSE-100 index loses 1,147.10 points, settles at 59,872.96","The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) plummeted nearly 2% to above 59,000 points on Friday amid intense political turmoil following the emergence of a new version of the story about former Premier Imran Khan’s ouster by a no-confidence motion in April 2022. The index traded predominantly in the red as mainstream political players failed to reach a coalition arrangement necessary to form a new government, discouraging investors.
In the morning, the trading session began sluggishly as persistent political uncertainty weighed heavily on investor sentiment, pushing the index down by over 1,000 points by mid-day. Weak export data reported by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics further dampened market spirits, leading to an intra-day low at 59,739.47 points. The market continued its sharp decline, closing with a loss of more than 1,100 points.
“Stocks sharply declined amidst dismal data showing negative LSM growth at -0.39% for July-Dec ‘23 and reports of Pakistan being downgraded to an authoritarian regime by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU),” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti. “Uncertainty over the power-sharing formula by major political parties, IMF’s new conditions over the next $1.2 billion tranche under SBA to liberalise imports, and the cabinet’s approvals for an increase in gas prices acted as catalysts for the bearish market close.”
At the close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a loss of 1,147.10 points, or 1.88%, settling at 59,872.96. Topline Securities noted in its report that Pakistan equities began the day negatively, continuing the momentum from the previous day. The bourse remained negative for most of the business hours, with the KSE-100 index hitting an intraday low at 59,740 level (down 1,281 points) and ultimately closing at the 59,873 level (losing 1,147 points; down 1.88%).
“Today’s pessimism stems from continuous uncertainty over the political front regarding the formation of the upcoming coalition setup, as political parties have yet to reach a conclusion in this regard,” Topline added. The Exploration & Production, Power, Tech, and Cement sectors contributed negatively to the index, with Oil and Gas Development Company, Hub Power, Pakistan Petroleum, Systems Limited, Mari Petroleum, and Lucky Cement collectively losing 465 points, according to the report.

Arif Habib Limited (AHL) observed in its report that stocks witnessed a close below 60k with a -5.14% week-on-week (WoW) decline, nearing the 59k February target set at the end of January, as the market entered a seasonally weak period. Only 13 stocks rose on Friday while 74 fell, with Oil and Gas Development Company (-5.47%), Hub Power (-2.65%), and Pakistan Petroleum (-4.12%) being the biggest drags on the index. Conversely, Engro Fertiliser (+2.12%) and Fatima Fertiliser (+7.36%) were the biggest index gainers, AHL wrote.
In significant developments, the federal cabinet approved a +12.3% increase in the weighted average gas price to Rs1,533/mmbtu. The gas tariff revision aligns with the IMF’s conditions for the upcoming second review of the Standby Arrangement, the report added. JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal noted that the market remained negative, with the KSE100 index losing 1,147 points to close at 59,873. “We recommend investors take advantage of any downside as an opportunity to buy in the Banking and Exploration & Production sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 314.2 million shares against Thursday’s tally of 345.1 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs12.3 billion. Shares of 331 companies were traded, with 77 stocks closing higher, 238 dropping, and 16 remaining unchanged.
K-Electric led in volume with trading in 41.8 million shares, losing Rs0.23 to close at Rs4.10. It was followed by WorldCall Telecom Limited with 25.7 million shares, losing Rs0.04 to close at Rs1.21, and Oil & Gas Development Company with 20.6 million shares, losing Rs6.18 to close at Rs107.93.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs636.14 million, according to NCPL.

6,Sesame exports to China surge 126.3%,"Surpass $290m mark, captures 19% market share in 2023 as key supplier","Pakistan’s export of sesame seeds to China registered a growth, surging 126.29% on a year-on-year (YoY) basis surpassing $290 million from January to December last year, said Ghulam Qadir, Commercial Counsellor of the Pakistan Embassy in Beijing.
According to the General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China (GACC), China imported 166,682.987 tonnes of sesame seeds from Pakistan in 2023. This represents an increase of 96.13% by volume, amounting to $290.66 million, compared to 84,985.321 tonnes worth $128.44 million in 2022.

In 2023, Pakistan contributed to around 19% of the total sesame seed exports to China from January to December.

Arbi urged caretaker Prime Minister Anwarul Haq Kakar, Federal Minister for Commerce, Industries and Production Dr Gohar Ejaz, and Minister for Energy Muhammad Ali to revoke the decision in the larger interest of the economy and to prevent industry collapse, according to a statement released by the association on Friday. Failure to do so, he warned, would lead to shutdowns, reduced exports, and widespread unemployment.

He stressed the importance of setting utility prices through stakeholder consultations to ensure they are reasonable and globally competitive, enabling uninterrupted industrial operations. Arbi warned that if gas tariffs are not reduced, they would adversely affect Pakistan’s exports.
