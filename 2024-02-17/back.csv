1,US concerned voter suppression in Pakistan,Questions have been raised about fairness of Feb 8 election both inside Pakistan as well as in major foreign capitals,"The United States is concerned about reports of intimidation and voter suppression in Pakistan’s election, the White House said on Thursday after reports of protests in some parts of the country.

Pakistan's election last week did not return a clear majority for anyone but independent candidates backed by jailed former prime minister Imran Khan won 92 out of 264 seats, making them the largest group.

Questions have been raised about the fairness of the Feb 8 election both inside Pakistan as well as in major foreign capitals, with Washington having previously said there were ""undue restrictions"" on freedoms of expressions and assembly.

“We are watching this very, very closely,” White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday, expressing concern about “intimidation and voter suppression”.

“International monitors are still taking a look at those tallies, I’m not going to get ahead of that process,” he added about the vote count.

3,PM warns against spreading anarchy,Kakar says elections step towards promoting democracy," Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Saturday said the recently conducted general elections in the country had been a step towards promoting democracy.

In a statement, he said, “Significant turnout from all segments of society, including both genders, has been acknowledged internationally.”

“Post elections, it is imperative that all stakeholders realise that victory and defeat are inherent aspects of democratic processes,” he added.

He said that parties and individuals who harboured any concerns regarding electoral irregularities were encouraged to pursue legal recourse through the available channels.

“Pakistan’s legislative, judicial, and executive branches are resilient and stand ready to deliver impartial justice to all.”
PM Kakar said, “While peaceful protest and assembly are fundamental rights, any form of agitation, violence, or incitement for vigilantism will not be condoned and law would take its course without any hesitation.”

“Anarchy and disorder will not be tolerated at this crucial time. This only serves to advance the agenda for hostile forces, both domestic and foreign, to exploit and create grave law and order challenges.”“The caretaker government implores patience, as political parties engage in consultations to form governments at both the federal and provincial levels, in accordance with democratic traditions and norms. We hope that this process concludes as early as possible with mutual understanding and respect,” he added.

4,Cabinet not satisfied with drugs pricing mechanism,Health ministry terms 2018 Drug Pricing Policy unfair to people,"The federal cabinet has observed that the medicine prices regulatory mechanism has become ineffective and exploitative amid credible complaints of endemic corruption, with the health ministry terming the 2018 Drug Pricing Policy unfair as it ensured “supernormal profits” for the pharmaceutical industry.

These concerns were shared by the cabinet members in a meeting on Dec 13, 2023, while considering approval of increase in maximum retail prices (MRPs) of 262 drugs under Hardship Category as recommended by the Drug Pricing Committee (DPC) in its 56th and 57th meetings.

The ministers held the view that the pharmaceutical industry was profit-centred, and not people-centric. They also lamented the poor performance of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) for not playing its role as required by the law.
Expressing concerns that the drugs regulatory mechanism had remained ineffective and exploitative and credible complaints of endemic corruption, the cabinet members emphasised the need for deregulating the pharmaceutical sector.
While discussing the method of increasing drug prices in phases and to avoid any disruption in the market, the cabinet members stressed the need for distinguishing priorities between life-saving drugs and other drugs.

The health ministry informed the cabinet that the Drug Pricing Policy, 2018 allowed consideration for hardship cases once in three years with certain conditions.

A minister proposed that the prices should be reviewed and fixed at the DPC or the ministry level, and not in the cabinet.
The health ministry explained that the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines were being followed for categorisation of essential and non-essential drugs, adding that the policy board was mandated to recommend essential and non-essential drugs to the cabinet with the purpose of use and generic name.

The cabinet observed that the import of drugs as well as import of raw material for manufacturing drugs put a heavy burden on foreign exchange, and that the problems of hoarding, smuggling, double-pricing and shortage of life-saving drugs merited serious attention.

The cabinet was apprised that on the recommendations of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC), different regional models were studied to bring improvements in the functional governance of the sector, adding that an application had been launched to register complaints, besides the helpline portal.

While deferring the approval of increase in the MRPs of 262 drugs under Hardship Category, the federal cabinet had directed for constituting a committee to have a comprehensive market analysis so that a well-informed and fair decision could be taken regarding fixing the drug prices.

The committee comprising finance, health, economic affairs, privatisation, inter-provincial coordination, ministers any other minister nominated by the prime minister and provincial health ministers was mandated to give its recommendation on reforming the process.

Following the cabinet directive, the committee met on Jan 11, 19, and 30, 2024. After thorough deliberations, the committee advised the health ministry to place its proposal based on the recommendations of the DPC of Drap, directly to the federal cabinet.
The ministry, in view of the current economic situation, solicited approval of the cabinet for an increase in the MRPs of 262 drugs in a phased manner – the MRPs of 17 drugs in short supply in the first phase and 37 in moderately short supply in the second phase.

It also recommended increase in the prices of remaining 208 drugs in the third phase.
The cabinet considered the summary and also decided to approve the increase in the MRPs of 146 essential drugs, with their generic names, as per the WHO criterion.

Meanwhile, the health ministry would submit its proposals to amend the Drug Pricing Policy, 2018 to improve fairness and transparency in the determination of drug prices to make it people-centric and to devolve decision-making of the drug pricing to the ministry or the DPC level.

6,Four more testify in SJC proceedings against Naqvi,CJ Isa says former SC judge can cross-examine witnesses if he wishes,"The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) recorded statements of four more witnesses during the proceedings against former Supreme Court judge Justice (retd) Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, and postponed further proceedings for an indefinite period.

The five-member SJC with Chief Justice Qazi Faiz Isa in the chair, continued the proceedings of the complaints filed against Justice Naqvi on charges of misconduct on the second consecutive day. The SJC decided not to summon Justice Naqvi’s son.

Chief Justice Isa remarked that the proceedings were being conducted on tax money and noted that two judges, who were members of the SJC, had come from other provinces. He noted that the matter was already pending in the Supreme Court but no injunction orders had been issued.

Chief Justice Isa revealed that the open proceedings were being conducted in the matter on an application, adding that there were complaints against some other judges also, which would be heard during the in-camera session.

Besides the chief justice, the SJC comprised Justice Sardar Tariq Masood and Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Lahore High Court (LHC) Chief Justice Amir Bhatti and Balochistan High Court (BHC) Chief Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan. Supreme Court Registrar Jazeela Aslam was also present as the SJC secretary.

During the proceedings, Justice (retd) Naqvi was not present to cross-examine the witnesses. The chief justice said that Justice (retd) Naqvi would know what was going on here and if he wanted, he could cross-examine the witnesses or submit his written reply.

The Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) submitted affidavit of witness Warda Naqvi regarding the Gulberg-III Lahore property. A private witness Mohammad Safdar Khan told the SJC that he bought the Gulberg-III property, measuring 2 kanals and 4 marlas, from Justice Naqvi in June 2022.

The witness added that the property was bought for Rs 130 million and the payment was made in the form of Rs30 million cash, and two pay orders of Rs50 million each in the name of Justice (retd) Naqvi and Chaudhry Shehbaz.

The AAG said that Justice (retd) Naqvi had bought the property on June 30, 2021 for Rs72 million and six months later, sold it for Rs130 million. Federal Government Employees Authority Director General Capt (retd) Zafar Iqbal presented documents about the three other properties allotted to Justice Naqvi.

Waqf Property Board Lahore Zone Administrator Ruman Jalal and Deputy Administrator Asif Ijaz informed the AJC that Justice (retd) Naqvi's son Syed Tassaduq Mustafa Naqvi was given a commercial property on lease in Dhamial Singh Mansion at the rate of Rs35 rupees per square yard.

They said that the rate charged for the property next to it was Rs205 rupees per square yard. The SJC chairman remarked that government plots were for honest government officials, why more than one plot was given to an official. Later, the proceedings were adjourned for an indefinite period.

7,PBC calls for probe into Chattha’s allegations,Notes that the electoral process has lost its integrity and credibility,"The Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) has called for a thorough investigation into the allegations made by Rawalpindi commissioner Liaquat Chattha on Saturday, adding that it is “deeply troubled” by the ongoing political turmoil due to alleged pre- and post-poll rigging in the February 8 polls.

“The recent allegations and disclosures by the Rawalpindi commissioner have heightened concerns surrounding the electoral process,” the country’s highest elected body of lawyers said in a statement.

In an explosive press conference, Chattha announced his resignation from his position on Saturday, confessing that massive rigging took place in Rawalpindi on February 8 under his watch. The civil servant also accused the chief justice of Pakistan and the chief election commission (CEC) of complicity.

The PBC noted that the electoral process has lost its integrity and credibility, adding that all political parties and stakeholders aggrieved by the electoral process and allegations of rigging must work towards establishing an independent commission acceptable to all political parties.

“Such a commission, free from bias and influence, is crucial to ensuring a fair and transparent electoral process that
commands the trust of all citizens,” it said.

It reiterated its previous concerns expressed before the election regarding the performance and credibility of CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja.

“Regrettably, these concerns were disregarded by the political parties, contributing to the current political turmoil. Addressing such concerns in a timely manner [including the resignation of the CEC] could have averted the present crisis,” it said.

The PBC also condemned the alleged coercion faced by independent candidates to align with specific political parties against their will. Every independent candidate must have the freedom to choose their affiliation without undue pressure or interference.

“In the end, the PBC urges all stakeholders to prioritize the restoration of trust in the electoral process and commit to upholding democratic principles for the stability and progress of Pakistan.”

It stated that now that the CEC “has played havoc with the whole election process”, the demand for justice from the same institution by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) through a press statement seems to be a “mockery of justice”.
The council also condemned the arrest of Fawad Chaudhry and Salman Akram Raja.

The lawyer said that the petitioner was also a candidate for the post of prime minister.

Chief Justice Ibrahim asked Additional Attorney General (AAG) Daniyal Chamkani about his views as to how much time should be given to the petitioner.

AAG Chamkani suggested that one month’s time should be given and the court concurred.

The petitioner’s lawyer also requested the court that there might be some supplementary cases in which bail should also be granted.

The chief justice remarked that the bail had been granted and no one would arrest Ayub.

9,Fazl’s ‘allies’ snub his claim on no-trust move,"PML-N, PPP, MQM-P say ex-army chief opposed Imran’s ouster","Contrary to JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s claim, his “allies” on Friday maintained that previous army chief Gen (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa was against bringing a vote of no-confidence motion against former premier Imran Khan in 2022.
PML-N leader Malik Ahmad Khan said contrary to what the JUI-F chief was claiming, Gen (retd) Bajwa opposed the idea of introducing a vote of no-confidence motion against PTI founding chairman Imran.
PPP’s Faisal Kareem Kundi also lashed out at the JUI-F chief for making these “disclosures” after enjoying a stint in power.
A day earlier, the Maulana accused the former army chief and ex-ISI director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed of orchestrating the downfall of the PTI government led by its founding chairman Imran in April 2022 by asking the then-opposition parties to initiate a vote of no-confidence motion against him under the banner of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM).
Speaking to a private TV news channel, Fazl claimed he was opposed to the idea of tabling a no- trust motion against Imran but “sacrificed” his opinion for the sake of his friends in the alliance.
Addressing a news conference in Lahore, Ahmed maintained that the former army chief met with the then opposition parties on March 26, 2022 at the Punjab Judges House, a huddle where he was present as well, bringing them a message from Imran that there could be a crisis in the country if a no-trust resolution was moved.
However, he added that the JUI-F chief resisted the former army chief’s proposal and in fact he was perturbed over the delay in moving the no-confidence resolution.
Ahmed wondered if the JUI-F chief could bring one person forward to back his claim about his meeting with Gen (retd) Bajwa.
He added that JUI-F chief’s statement was contrary to the facts, and he should come up with evidence to show that he held a meeting with the former army chief and the ex-spymaster, where they asked him to introduce the no-trust motion.
He pointed out that at the time of the meeting, Lt Gen (retd) Faiz was not even the ISI DG and serving as a corps commander “somewhere”. Ahmed was correct as Lt Gen (retd) Faiz had been appointed the Peshawar corps commander at that time.
The PML-N leader said all PDM parties worked hard to make the vote of no-trust motion successful -- a feat that nobody else had pulled off in the country’s history before.
He continued that the PDM was of the view that the country would default if the economic situation and inflation continued as they were.
PPP’s Faisal Kareem Kundi, while addressing a news conference in Islamabad, claimed that the JUI-F chief was the biggest beneficiary of the no-trust motion himself, adding that he could have opted to stay out of the move being the head of the PDM.
He pointed out that now when the government formation was under way after the end of the polls, a major twist was seen on Thursday when a the JUI-F chief met with a PTI delegation despite a history of bad blood between them.
Kundi inquired that as the president of the PDM, on whose instructions had Fazl staged a sit-in in Islamabad and then why did suddenly call if off.
He maintained that after enjoying the perks of ministries during the coalition government’s 16 months in power, the JUI-F was protesting in Sindh and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa after tasting defeat in the polls.
The MQM-P also dismissed the JUI-F chief’s claim about the no-trust motion being initiated at the behest of Gen (retd) Bajwa as “baseless”.
Addressing a news conference at the MQM-P’s temporary headquarters in Karachi, the party’s convener and former federal minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui questioned the motive behind such statements after the elections and expressed concern about their potential impact on democracy.
He clarified that the meeting in question took place on March 26 2022, where MQM was also invited and he represented the party.
Siddiqui continued that the JUI-F chief’s claims were completely different from the actual case and situation discussed during the huddle.
Disclosing details about the meeting, the MQM-P convener said Gen (retd) Bajwa had urged the then-opposition parties to withdraw the no-confidence motion and find a middle ground. According to Siddiqui, the political leaders present at the meeting discussed various aspects, including the country’s economy.
