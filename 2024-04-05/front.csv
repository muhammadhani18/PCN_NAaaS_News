0,Pakistan seeks to unlock Saudi investment,"Shehbaz to meet MBS, discuss investment during two-day visit","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will leave for Saudi Arabia on Saturday (today) on his first major foreign visit since his election in February, the Foreign Office announced on Friday, as the newly-formed government seeks to unlock opportunities in the strategic sectors, particularly in Reko Diq -- one of the largest copper and gold reserves in the world.
In addition to financial support, Pakistan has lately been trying to secure Saudi investment in industries ranging from agriculture to mines, minerals and aviation. Islamabad says Riyadh has shown interest in acquiring government stakes in Reko Diq gold and copper mine, which could be a major deal for the country’s economy.
During his two-day visit starting April 6, the prime minister will perform Umrah and offer prayers at Masjid Nabwi Al-Sharif. The prime minister will be accompanied by ministers for foreign affairs, defence; finance, information and economic affairs.
The prime minister is also expected to meet Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman and discuss issues of mutual interest. The two leaders will also exchange views on regional and global developments.
The government has prepared a comprehensive plan to bag an investment of over $1 billion from Saudi Arabia in the Reko Diq Copper-Gold Project located in Balochistan’s Chaghi district.
The plan, prepared by the finance and energy ministries as well as the Board of Investment, has been presented to the prime minister. Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb will give a special briefing to the kingdom’s investors on the investment plan in the project.

Saudi Arabia will also be given special incentives to invest in the project and the finance minister will inform the investors about them during his briefing.
Sources said the size of Saudi Arabia's investment transaction in the Reko Diq Copper-Gold Project would be the largest even though the Canadian firm, Barrick Gold Corporation, owns 50% stake in the mine.
The major investment in the project is being made through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). The council was established to attract foreign investments, specially from the Gulf nations. In September last year, it unveiled a new visa policy, targeting increased investments from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations and other countries.
The sources said the SIFC had been taken into confidence in connection with the Saudi investment in the project as well as the plan chalked out for the purpose.
On the trip to Saudi Arabia, members of the committee established for investment in the Reko Diq Copper-Gold Project -- including officials of the finance and energy ministries as well as the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) -- will also accompany the premier.
The Saudi government has not yet commented on the visit or its agenda. Sharif last traveled to Saudi Arabia during his first term as PM in October 2022. He met the crown prince during the visit and also attended the Saudi Future Investment Initiative summit.

1,Length of penalty in cypher case baffles IHC,Bench says maximum two-year sentence prescribed for copy loss," 
An Islamabad High Court (IHC) bench hearing appeals of former prime minister Imran Khan and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi against their conviction in the cipher case was informed on Thursday that the case was not about losing the original cipher but a copy of it.
The lawyer for the appellants, Barrister Salman Safdar, said that when a cipher was lost, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and senior security officials had to be informed about it. As per the law, he added, the time period for returning the cipher copy was one year.
The bench, led by Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, heard the appeal against the sentence awarded to Imran and Qureshi. During the hearing, lawyer Salman Safdar continued his arguments.
On January 30, a special court convicted Imran and Qureshi in a case related to the misuse of a diplomatic cipher during the final days of the PTI government in March 2022, sentencing each of them to 10 years in prison under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), 1923.
Continuing his arguments on the appeals, Safdar explained that eight copies of the cipher were made and distributed to different people. According to the former secretary to the prime minister, one copy was given to the then prime minister, which had been lost.
Safdar said that the PTI founder was convicted under both clauses about negligent and willful loss of documents. The chief justice noted that punishment could not be awarded under both sections of the OSA, adding that it would be either Section 5(1)C or 5(1)D.
The lawyer said that normally, the copy of the cipher was returned to the Foreign Office within a period of one year. But in this case, he added, notice was given after seven months, while a criminal case was also lodged without any departmental inquiry.
Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb asked the lawyer on which document he relied to state that the cipher copy was to be returned in one year. Safdar replied that, as per the record, one of the witnesses had said that the general practice was that the copy was to be returned in one year.
Safdar continued that there was no document on record to show that the copy had to be returned within one year. He added that then foreign secretary Sohail Mehmood had said in a statement that the prime minister's cipher copy had been lost.
According to Sohail Mahmood, the lawyer said, Azam Khan, the then principle secretary to the prime minister, had asked him for a new copy of the cipher, but the then secretary declined the request, saying that he should look for their own copy, as a new copy could not be issued.
On that, Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb remarked that Azam Khan was the only witness to the handing over of the cipher copy to Imran, adding that if Azam Khan’s statement was removed, then there would be no witness.
Safdar mentioned that there was a book called “Security of Classified Matters in Government Departments”, which was related to the working of cipher. Hamid Ali Shah, the prosecutor from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), interjected and said that it was a top secret document.
When Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb asked whether the trial court judge had a copy of it, Safdar replied that a copy of it was not with the judge, nor was anyone else allowed to see it. On that, the chief justice pointed out that some of its sections had been written in the decision on bail matters.
Chief Justice Aamer Farooq remarked that the punishment for losing a cipher copy was up to two years. In this case, he added, the trial court had awarded a two-year sentence, which was the maximum. Further hearing of the appeals would be held on April 16.

2,Mystery of poison letters deepens,Letter handed over to CTD; number of LHC judges to receive suspicious letter reaches six,"The specter of alarming ""threatening letters"" rattling the top judiciary refused to fade into the shadows as Lahore High Court's (LHC) Justice Ali Baqar Najafi found himself the recipient of a ""suspicious"" letter on Friday.
In a disturbing development, the content of these letters, it was disclosed, contained traces of arsenic, adding a toxic layer to an already murky situation as the spate of letters continues to rattle judges amid a heated political climate.
Similarly, the tally of Supreme Court justices grappling with ominous letters surged to 10, with five more judges finding themselves in the crosshairs. All the letters were dispatched on the same date. However, some judges discovered the letters belatedly.
Justices Ayesha Malik, Irfan Saadat Khan, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, and Munib Akhtar were among those on the receiving end of unsettling letters on Friday, according to sources.
The sources said the chemicals in the letters sent to Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges contained arsenic, prompting authorities to task the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of the federal police with probing the ‘mysterious letters’.
In the most recent series of such letters, Justice Najafi became the sixth judge from the LHC to be singled out by a ""suspicious"" letter.
Inspector Muhamad Anis from the Special Branch disclosed that the letter was delivered to Justice Najafi's secretary. Out of the five letters received by the secretary, one raised suspicion.
Anis further confirmed that the concerned letter was promptly handed over to the CTD. However, Anis refrained from providing details regarding the potential presence of toxic substances or threatening content within the letter.
The total number of LHC judges receiving the letter reached six. The letter received by Justice Najafi was said to have been handed over to the CTD.
Two days ago, eight judges, including Chief Justice Aamer Farooq of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) received letters containing an unknown powder, suspected to be laced with anthrax.
A day later, the letters containing the suspicious powdery toxic substance were sent to the Supreme Court jurists, including Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, as well as other judges of the LHC.
CTD teams formed
As part of the ongoing efforts to address recent threats targeting esteemed justices, three teams from the CTD have been deployed across key locations in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Lahore.
Comprising two teams in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, with an additional team stationed in Lahore, these investigative units have been tasked with probing the alarming influx of threatening letters directed at honourable justices.
The Lahore team boasts a force of 11 members, underscoring the gravity of the situation.
The focal point of the investigation revolves around scrutinizing the vicinities surrounding the post offices from which these ominous letters were dispatched. Investigators aim to sift through CCTV footage, although challenges persist due to the scarcity of available recordings.
Moreover, the teams are compiling data on individuals who frequented or availed themselves of postal services during pertinent time frames. The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) is extending support to facilitate profiling efforts and identify the accused.
In a parallel development, following yet another menacing letter addressed to a judge in Lahore, a multi-agency response was promptly initiated. The Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA), in tandem with the CTD and local law enforcement, swiftly visited the scene to gather vital evidence.
‘Traces of arsenic found’
According to sources within the CTD, the forensic analysis of the substance found in the suspicious letters sent to IHC judges has uncovered the presence of arsenic.
The disturbing revelation has prompted heightened concerns.
The forensic examination indicated a significant concentration of arsenic, amounting to 15% in the substance. Arsenic, notorious for its toxicity and deadly effects, poses a grave risk to human health, particularly impacting the nervous system.
The CTD intends to present this crucial forensic report to the Supreme Court within the coming three to four days.
The office of the director general (DG) of the Pakistan Post issued a notification on Friday conveying specific instructions regarding mail addressed to judges, diplomats, and other high-profile individuals.
Urging immediate action, the DG asked for the mail to be carefully examined and delivered to the R&I section of the relevant office. Furthermore, the director general also emphasized the safety of the postal staff handling the mail.

""Ensuring the safety and security of the postal operational staff is our prime responsibility and priority,"" stated the DG in his letter. Postmaster generals were directed to provide masks and gloves to staff members to mitigate potential risks associated with handling hazardous materials.
The notice explicitly instructed all postal staff to exercise extreme caution when handling letters and packages brought into the post office.
""Any unattended and suspected material should be immediately reported to the supervisor on duty, local administration, and the head of the unit and circle concerned,"" the notification stated.
""Postal staff posted at counters, DMOs, and Delivery Post Offices should also be directed to remain vigilant while booking, sorting, transmitting, and delivering mail,"" the notice added.
Staff members were asked to comply with Rule-171 of the PO Manual Volume VI, which outlines the proper treatment of articles presented for registration, as well as Rule-122 of Volume-V, which prohibits certain articles from being transmitted by inland post.
Additionally, the notification emphasized adherence to Section 23 of the Post Office Act, 1898, which delineates the authority to address postal articles posted in contravention of the act. The SOPs were issued by DG Pakistan Post.
New SOPs for parcel booking
On the other hand, the authorities tightened the rules for booking parcels across the country, as the investigation into the threatening letters sent to the judges continues.
According to sources, the CTD of the federal police and other law-enforcement agencies is investigating the powder-laced letters that were sent to the judges. They added that the letters carried the stamp of the sub-divisional post office in the Satellite Town of Rawalpindi.
The chemical in the letters has been sent for forensics, and the staff at the Satellite Town sub-divisional post office are being questioned. The police are also gathering the CCTV footage of the postboxes of the post office and the fingerprints on the letters.
In the wake of the incident, the authorities have issued new standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the booking of parcels. The new SOPs, which will be implemented immediately, make it mandatory that the sender’s complete address, telephone number, and identity card number are written on the parcel.
Under the new SOPs, booking clerks will be held responsible in case of booking of all types of prohibited articles, and items. “It will be necessary to write the full name, complete address, telephone number, and identity card number of the person booking the parcel,” the SOPs said.
At the time of booking, according to the SOPs, checking of all the items in the parcel has been made mandatory and if any prohibited item is found in the parcel sent at any point, the responsible booking clerk, or gate officer will be directly responsible.
The SOPs say that if any prohibited items are found during the checking of the parcel, it will be necessary to call the police immediately for the arrest of the person making the booking. The new SOPs have been sent to all post offices and national and international mail offices across the country.

3,PTI wants a full-court on letter controversy,Announces nationwide movement against rigging post Eid," 
The PTI has demanded the formation of a full court of the Supreme Court to address allegations raised by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges regarding interference of state institutions in judicial affairs and the recent threatening letters received by various senior judges.
The former ruling party has also announced the launch of a nationwide protest movement, along with other opposition parties, after Eidul Fitr against alleged rigging in the February 8 polls.
Senior PTI leaders—Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, Asad Qaiser, and Shah Farman—made these announcements on Thursday after meeting with PTI founder and former Prime Minister Imran Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail.
During the media interaction, Omar Ayub stated that Imran Khan stands with the judiciary and the six IHC judges who raised their voices against state interference in court cases. ""We demand that the SC form a full-court to address the issues raised in the IHC judges’ letter,"" he said.
Omar reiterated the claim that Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, was poisoned. Bushra, sentenced to 10 years in prison in the gift repository case, is currently detained at Imran’s Bani Gala residence. The PTI leader said Bushra's resilience is a source of strength for Imran Khan.
Asad Qaiser said the party is planning to launch a robust movement against electoral fraud in consultation with other opposition parties.
He announced that the first meeting regarding this movement will be held in Quetta on April 12 at the residence of BNP chief Akhtar Mengal. ""We will disclose the schedule for the nationwide movement after the meeting,"" he added.
Qasir also expressed grievances over the lack of necessary cooperation from the federal government with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) government, stating that the delay in releasing funds to the province, where the PTI is in power, is hindering the smooth operation of government affairs.
He condemned the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to postpone Senate elections in K-P, lamenting that the people of K-P are facing repercussions for reposing their trust in the country's most popular political party, the PTI.
Shibli Faraz emphasized the necessity of legal battles and scrutiny of electoral documents to combat the imposition of rejected candidates. He warned that the country’s economy would suffer if a government brought into power through electoral fraud was allowed to rule.
Meanwhile, Imran Khan has appointed five focal persons to articulate the party's policies. These focal persons are PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub, Senator Ali Zafar, and senior lawyer Intazar Hussain Panjutha.

4,Blinken sets tone of ties in phone call to Dar,"Washington, Islamabad resolve to strengthen cooperation","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday telephoned his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar in a maiden contact in which both sides reviewed bilateral ties and discussed regional and international issues.
“Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar received a telephone call from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken today (Friday),” said a statement issued by the Foreign Office.
The statement said both sides reiterated their dedication to strengthening bilateral cooperation across all spheres of mutual interest.
A wide range of bilateral issues, including enhancing trade and investment relations, climate change, agriculture and security came under discussion, it added.
The statement further said that various matters of regional importance such as the situation in Gaza, the Red Sea, and developments in Afghanistan were also discussed. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the current positive momentum in bilateral relations.
The telephonic conversation between the two top diplomats came on the heels of a letter earlier written by President Joe Biden to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Biden’s letter was the first formal contact between the White House and the Prime Minister's Office in years. The US President never reached out directly to any of the Pakistani prime ministers during his term as president. He never spoke to former prime minister Imran Khan nor interacted with his successor Shehbaz Sharif.

However the latest flurry of engagements at the highest level between the two countries suggested that there seems to be a change in US policy towards Pakistan.
Meanwhile, according to a statement issued by the US embassy, Secretary of State Antony J Blinken reaffirmed the US commitment to a robust partnership between the US and Pakistan “that advances the prosperity of both nations”.
Secretary Blinken stressed the importance of continued cooperation on counterterrorism, expanding trade and investment partnerships, and advancing women’s economic security and empowerment, the statement added.
Observers believe that the uncertain situation in Afghanistan and the renewed threat of global terrorism might have pushed Washington to keep the channel of communication open with Islamabad.
US generals in recent testimonies before Congress admitted Pakistan’s vital role in the Afghan situation and counter-terrorism operations.
CENTCOM chief General Michael Kurilla told the US Arms Services Committee in one of the recent briefings that Pakistan had invaluable experience in dealing with Afghanistan and was a willing partner in counter-terrorism efforts.
However, experts feel that it is too early to say if the re-engagement between Pakistan and the US would lead to some tangible partnership.
A lot will depend on the situation unfolding in Afghanistan and the outcome of the presidential elections in the US which are scheduled for later this year.
Pakistan is keen to maintain constructive engagement with the US as it considers Washington’s support crucial for IMF bailouts and help from other Washington-based lenders.
