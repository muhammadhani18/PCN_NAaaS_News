KARACHI: A rare record-breaking spree continued in the fag-end of Ramazan on the back of aggressive value-hunting by jubilant investors, tossing the KSE 100-share index to an all-time high closing above 68,000 on Thursday.
Topline Securities Ltd Chief Executive Muhammad Suhail told Dawn that the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) normally sees low volume and lacklustre activities in Ramazan. Still, due to political stability post-election and other developments, the market is touching new highs as expected, he added.
“Overall economic activities are showing signs of stabilisation. Inflation is finally coming down from 38 per cent to 20.7pc in March while the rupee has remained stable in the last year,” he explained, adding that all this signals that the new government will be able to secure an IMF deal boosting investor confidence.
Buying interest was observed in the pharmaceutical sector on news that the Lahore High Court had vacated the stay order against the deregulation of the maximum retail price of drugs in favour of the pharmaceutical industry. As a result, multiple pharma companies closed at their respective upper limits.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation told Dawn that the equities market closed at an all-time high in the holy month due to a robust corporate earnings outlook.
He said the expected monetary policy easing, $1bn Saudi Reko Diq deal next month, Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd and Pakistan Petroleum Ltd share offerings, surging global crude oil prices and anticipation of positive talks for new IMF programme were the key triggers fuelling bullish sentiments.
Answering a question about the expected hike in electricity tariffs under IMF conditions, he said the power tariff would further rise to resolve the circular debt crisis, and the IMF would seek more solutions to avoid a slowdown in economic growth owing to surging energy costs.
Regarding the chances of economic optimism’s sustainability in view of the likely heating up of political issues after Eidul Fitr, Mr Ahsan said political noise and economic uncertainty are the new normal for the geopolitical scenario and could be an opportunity to prioritise sectors.
He added that reforms for tax revenue and power sector issues could be the next target for the government to manage fiscal deficits.
“Retail investors should take a longer-term view up to two years when interest rates could be in single digits and high dividends paying stocks should be priority owing to political and economic uncertainty, he advised.
The benchmark index hit an intraday record high of 68,439.37, gaining 683.34 points. However, it closed at 67,756.04 points after adding 660.75 points, or 0.98 per cent from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume rose 7.44pc to 388.75 million shares. The traded value surged 50.26pc to Rs17.88bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (47.20m shares), Cnergyico PK (29.71m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (21.12m shares), Pakistan Refinery Ltd (16.96m shares) and Searle Company (15.79m shares).
The companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Hoechst Pakistan Ltd (Rs49.50), Shahmurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs40.61), Highnoon Labor­atories Ltd (Rs38.17), Abbott Labor­atories Ltd (Rs34.84) and Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs26.24).
The shares registering the most significant decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs80.00), Nestle Pakistan (Rs33.44), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs8.65), Lucky Cement Ltd (Rs7.58) and Shield Corporation (Rs5.18)
Foreign investors remained net buyers as they picked shares worth $1.06m.

1,Aleem showcases PIA opportunity to investors,The minister hoped that Pakistani businesses would show their interest in acquiring the national airline.,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Privatisation Abdul Aleem Khan has called PIA “an attractive opportunity” for local and international investors, especially after restructuring its liabilities.
Chairing a meeting of the Privatisation Commission Board on Thursday, the minister hoped that Pakistani businesses would show their interest in acquiring the national airline.
The Privatisation Commission Board, in the two sessions held on April 2 and 4, approved the prequalification criteria and the committee for evaluating bids and interests submitted for PIA’s divestment.
The government appointed Ernst & Young, a global financial advisory firm, to prepare the plan for the loss-making firm, which completed its task during the caretaker setup.
The caretaker cabinet has approved Ernst & Young’s appointment for the financial and administrative reorganisation of PIA.
The financial advisor and the committee would evaluate prequalification documents to determine whether interested buyers meet the prescribed standards and criteria, which include experience, financial stability, technical expertise, safety record, and other relevant factors.
To speed up the privatisation process, the national airline has been bifurcated into two companies — the Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PIAC) and PIA Holding.
The former would own flying operations, while the airline’s non-core assets and liabilities have been transferred to the latter.The Privatisation Commission, through an advertisement in national and international newspapers on April 2, has already invited expressions of interest from investors willing to buy majority stakes in PIACL.

3,Engro signs SPA to sell energy assets worth Rs34.7bn,"The consortium consists of Liberty Mills Ltd, Soorty Enterprises, and Procon Engineering through Master Group of Industries.","KARACHI: Engro Energy Ltd (EEL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Engro Corporation Ltd, has entered into a share purchase agreement (SPA) with Liberty Power Holding (Pvt) Ltd and a consortium to sell its thermal energy assets portfolio.
The consortium consists of Liberty Mills Ltd, Soorty Enterprises, and Procon Engineering through Master Group of Industries. Selling thermal assets is part of Engro’s ongoing efforts to streamline and optimise capital and resource allocation.
According to a press release, the SPA has been signed for the sale of Engro Energy’s entire 68.9pc shareholding in Engro Powergen Qadirpur Ltd (EPQL), 50.1pc shareholding in Engro Powergen Thar (Pvt) Ltd (EPTL), and 11.9pc shareholding in Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company Ltd (SECMC).
The transaction value of each of EEL’s shareholdings is: EPTL: Rs21.04 billion, SECMC: Rs6.21bn and EPQL: Rs7.5bn, in each case, subject to certain adjustments as agreed in the definitive agreements. Completion of the transaction is subject to the agreed conditions, including receipt of corporate/regulatory approvals and lender consent.
Engro entered the energy vertical in 2008 by establishing Engro Powergen Qadirpur Ltd, a power asset that utilised flare gas, to help solve the unprecedented energy crisis faced by Pakistan. The Group has continued to achieve significant milestones in the energy sector, including unearthing Thar coal and subsequent Mine expansions under SECMC, and setting up two 330 MW EPTL power plants. These energy assets are consistently ranked amongst the most efficient, reliable, and compliant in terms of global safety and environmental standards.

4,Depreciation fears prompt exporters to sell dollars,SBP reserves increase for fourth week to reach $8.04bn.,"KARACHI: Banks are experiencing a surplus of dollars, driven by exporters swiftly selling their earnings in anticipation of further depreciation of the US currency.
In the currency market, some banks are considered export banks due to their large network of exporters, who sell their proceeds to these banks. According to currency dealers, there’s been a remarkable increase in the inflow of export proceeds, exerting pressure on the exchange rate.
“The current situation could have driven the dollar to even lower rates, which would have been detrimental for exporters,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market.
Over the past three months, the exchange rate has gradually strengthened the rupee against the dollar, which closed at Rs277.93 on Thursday. The dollar’s value has decreased by around Rs3 in the interbank market during this period.

SBP reserves increase for fourth week to reach $8.04bn

Moreover, the forward premium — a future currency exchange rate — has dropped by over 50 per cent for six months, reducing to Rs14 from a peak of Rs24 per dollar within the fiscal year.
Similarly, the forward-booking premium for three months has come down to Rs8 per dollar, showing waning confidence in the greenback. The government is now taking measures to prevent further dollar depreciation to support exporters.
Banking sector dealers have observed that importers, in anticipation of future costs, are securing dollars at these adjusted premiums for three, four and six months to manage their import needs.
The banks are following the State Bank’s policy to provide dollars to importers only when they have in their accounts. This policy has restricted imports, resulting in reduced trade as well as current account deficits. Importers are still facing restrictions on some essential and non-essential imports.
Though the SBP has expanded the list of imports of essential items, importers said the restrictions have significantly affected the economic growth. Pakistan depends on imports of raw materials on a large scale for its finished domestic and exportable products.
The low imports and high inflation reduced the consumption in the country, resulting in negative growth in the previous fiscal year and just 1pc growth rate in the second quarter of this year. The World Bank estimates the country’s economy to grow by only 1.8pc this fiscal year.
SBP reserves up $19m
The SBP reported on Thursday that the reserves have increased by $19m to $8.04 billion. The currency market believes that the improvement in the SBP’s reserves was due to the purchasing of dollars from the interbank market. This is a usual practice of the SBP.
The country’s total foreign exchange reserves have reached $13.38bn, including $5.34bn of the commercial banks during the week ended on March 29.
The central bank also hopes to receive about $1.2bn this month as the final tranche of the ongoing short-term loan agreement with the IMF.
The inflow will help the State Bank to bear the outflow of $1bn, which is due for the payment against the maturing of Eurobonds. The maturity of the bonds is expected by mid-April.
The banking market also expects higher inflows of remittances due to Ramazan that would help the State Bank to manage its foreign exchange reserves and the exchange rate.

5,Fines imposed on five power firms for ‘illegal loadshedding’,The regulator said it had taken up the issue to investigate several complaints regarding unscheduled loadshedding by the general public.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday imposed a fine of Rs50 million each on five power distribution companies including K-Electric for carrying out commercial-based excessive loadshedding in violation of laws penalising honest consumers.
It is for the first time the regulator has moved from issuing warnings against collective punishments in the power sector which started more than a decade ago in Karachi and was adopted by public sector companies with the tacit approval of the federal government and penalised power companies for revenue-based loadshedding.
In its similar but separate judgments, the power regulator observed that collective punishment to all consumers for the wrongs of a few could not be allowed indefinitely through disconnection of electricity to consumers on the basis of aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses. It issued judgments on five power distribution companies from Karachi, Quetta, Peshawar, Hyderabad and Sukkur.
The regulator said it had taken up the issue to investigate several complaints regarding unscheduled loadshedding by the general public during public hearings on monthly fuel price adjustments and written means. “Upon inquiry, it was revealed that loadshedding is being carried out based on AT&C losses policy which is not in line with the provisions of the Nepra Act, 1997, and Performance Standards (Distribution) Rules, 2005, and has never been recognised by Nepra”, it said.
It sought views and reports from the power companies and, having found unsatisfactory responses, formally issued show-cause notices and provided companies with an opportunity to defend themselves. While some of them gave varying reasons, most of them conceded AT&C-based power cuts and claimed they were being done under the government’s policy.
It said the power companies, under the documents they submitted to the regulator, it was “obligatory” on power utilities to “provide and ensure fair, reliable, equitable, and uninterrupted distribution of electricity services” in accordance with the eligibility criteria, performance standards, safety health, and environment protection.
However, it was noted that licensees were even violating their own so-called AT&C policies and carrying out excessive loadshedding as compared to the scheduled one. Moreover, a few feeders were randomly selected, and observed that the licensees had failed to make improvements in technical and financial health of those feeders since many years despite having been allowed colossal amounts for operations and maintenance. They were “continuing their operations in status quo, due to which, even good paying consumers suffer a lot”.
The KE contended that a major component of AT&C loss-based load shed policy was the recovery ratio based on which the feeders were categorized into respective load shed categories. Over the years the paying propensity of the consumers has been significantly impacted due to the ongoing economic condition of the country, leading to significant challenges on the recovery front, distorting the recovery ratio, especially in the last 12 months, consequently affecting the loss profile of feeders. Similar views also came from other companies.
The Nepra observed that attributing economic conditions alone overlooked potential internal inefficiencies and shortcomings in the companies’ operations and management. Moreover, instead of solely relying on recovery ratios as the basis for load-shedding policies, the companies should explore alternative measures to address financial challenges, such as improving billing and collection processes, reducing technical losses, and enhancing consumer awareness regarding the importance of timely payments.
Additionally, companies should prioritise transparency and accountability in their operations to rebuild consumer trust and ensure fair treatment for all consumers regardless of economic conditions.
It noted that there was still AT&C-based load shedding on 30pc of the KE’s feeders and weekly monitoring reports suggest that KE was “not even following its so-called AT&C-based load shedding criteria and the consumers are experiencing extended hours of load shedding even more than their scheduled hours”.
The regulator said that Nepra laws permit load shedding solely for technical reasons, without any allowance for load shedding based on commercial considerations, such as a regime that differentiates between higher and lower-paying consumers.
The Nepra noted that public sector companies were “admitting the allegations” and claiming that the loadshedding priorities under Nepra standards and rules were “deliberately not being followed by all and that the law is impractical & ultra vires… the load shedding is happening on the instruction of the Ministry of Energy”.
The loadshedding hours were ranged from 2.5 to 10 hours. Companies were “trying to hide” inefficiencies and showing a reduction in line losses by implementing AT&C load shedding for most consumers instead of implementing corrective measures to improve feeder losses.
