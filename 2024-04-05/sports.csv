0,Target-less procurement decried,Wheat growers warn of protest amidst fears of market crash,"For the first time, the Punjab Food Department will carry out wheat procurement without a target set by the provincial cabinet.
After the cabinet did not set the target in the wheat procurement policy, the responsibility of the food department in this regard has increased.
According to sources, the department has gunny bags available to buy two million tonnes of wheat. However, under the policy of the authorities, it will try to buy less than 500,000 tonnes of the commodity.
The provincial cabinet has also significantly reduced number of sacks per acre and transportation charges for issuance of the official gunny bags.
On the other hand, farmer organisations have criticised the procurement policy, expressing fear that middlemen, traders and flour mills have been given a free rein to exploit them.
Leaders of farmer groups expressed apprehension that there was a risk of the market of fresh wheat in Punjab crashing and the price falling to about Rs3,200 per maund.
They warned that all farmer organisations would give a call for a protest demonstration in Lahore after mutual consultation.
Meanwhile, the Flour Mills Association asserted that the business should be free. The mills in the province have the capacity to up to three million tonnes of wheat.
Under the policy approved by the cabinet, 384 procurement centres will be set up in the province. The number was the same last year.
In the past three years, the food department had not fixed the limit of area for issuing official gunny bags for the procurement. Earlier, the department used to set a limit of up to 12 acres every year.
However, this time a limit of six acres has been fixed for issuing the Bardana.
In the past, 10 sacks per acre were issued, but this year the number has been reduced to six.
At the same time, the transportation charges paid to farmers per sack have been reduced from Rs60 to Rs30.
The provincial cabinet also approved the abolition of per kilogramme commission of banks for payment to farmers for the wheat procurement.
The sources said the food department had gunny bags for two million tonnes of wheat. The tender for purchasing the bags has expired and if the government has to take a decision to procure more wheat in the coming days due to pressure from the farmers, immediate acquisition of additional gunny bags will be a big challenge.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Pakistan Kisan Ittehad President Khalid Mahmood Khokhar said the official support price Rs3,900 were maund was low and the cost of production had increased a lot.
He said that the limits of six sacks per acre and six acres were unjustified as the owner of up to 12.5 acres of land were considered small farmers.
He alleged that the government had announced “an anti-farmer policy at the behest of the bureaucracy”.
As a result of the policy, the price of freshly harvested wheat would drop and the farmers would suffer a huge loss, he warned.
All Pakistan Kisan Foundation chief Mahmood Bukhari said the policy approved by the cabinet showed that the government does not want to buy wheat and will leave the farmers at the mercy of traders, middlemen and flour mills.
He said an official had assured him earlier that the government would buy plenty of wheat from the farmers.
On Wednesday morning, the price of fresh wheat in Rahim Yar Khan was Rs3,500 per 40kg and the implementation of the policy and arrival of more wheat in the markets would result in a reduction after Eid, he warned.
He said all farmer organisations would jointly protest over the issue.
However, Pakistan Flour Mills Association Chairman Asim Raza insisted that the business should always be free. In the current situation, the flour mills do not have the capacity to buy more than three million tonnes of wheat to accumulate stock, he added.

1,Breathing life into a new identity for Mustafabad,"Project involves repainting exteriors of over 1,000 homes and community spaces","Mustafabad, once a neglected village of district Kasur, has recently began to catch the public’s attention as the ‘Let’s Colour’ campaign kicked off in the area.
As part of the campaign, various parts of the village were coloured by a paint company. The initiative attracted public from Lahore and other nearby cities. The locals also appreciated the efforts for providing colorful celebrations and happiness to the village.
A leading producer of paints and coatings started the impactful social initiative in collaboration with the Akhuwat Foundation.
The transformative project involved repainting the exteriors of over 1,000 homes and community spaces. The initiative saw a collaborative effort involving 41 team members along with 26 skilled painters and mural artists from Mustafabad, working passionately over four months. Together, they breathed life into a new identity for Mustafabad.
Incorporating local artists in the project was widely appreciated as the culture and traditions of the area were highlighted.
Mustafabad is exposed to high temperatures, so appropriate paint was applied to the homes as protection against the weather. The exterior emulsion not only ensures long-lasting all-weather protection but also incorporates a technology effectively lowering surface temperatures by up to 5°C, making a tangible and beneficial impact on the local community.

 
A resident of the village, Muhammad Riaz, commented on the initiative, ""A positive change has emerged among the locals after the painting and art work and we are now aware of the importance of cleanliness. Our streets used to give an impression of neglect but now this is the most beautiful village of our district. The sentiments of happiness are also shared by our kids and females as they now can proudly tell others that they are residents of Mustafabad, the most beautiful village of this area.”
CEO AkzoNobel, Mubbasher Omer, also shared his take on the initiative, “We are proud to see how ‘Let’s Colour’ is revitalising more than just walls. The vibrant colours make living spaces more fun and enjoyable. The transformation has helped to uplift the community with renewed pride and hope today while painting a better tomorrow for Mustafabad.”

2,Girl students defend school from illegal land conversion,Landlord wanted to construct commercial buildings on premises,"The young girls attending a nearby public school rose to the occasion, shielding their educational space from a landlord's endeavour to transform it into a commercial zone.
The young students of Government Primary Girls School approached the office of SDPO Circle, DSP Tahir Ejaz, to report the ongoing unauthorised commercial construction within their school compound, despite prior notice from the school administration.
Upon receiving the collective complaint, SDPO Tahir Ejaz promptly escalated the matter to DPO Hussnain Haider and AC Asghar Laghari for immediate action.
The assistant commissioner, accompanied by revenue officials, police personnel and SDPO Tahir Ejaz, proceeded to the site to verify the claims.
Eyewitnesses confirmed that landlord Ghulam Abbas along with his sons Muhammad Yunis and Amir, accompanied by their friend Abdul Khaliq, were overseeing the construction of commercial buildings on the school's premises.
Following a thorough investigation conducted by revenue department officials, it was conclusively established that the land being developed belonged to the school.
Subsequently, law enforcement authorities apprehended the landlord and his accomplices involved in the illegal occupation of public property, registering cases against them.
In a decisive move, the assistant commissioner ordered the demolition of the unauthorised structures erected on the school's land, comprising shops and a house.
DPO Hussnain Haider commended the courageous actions of the young students, whose timely intervention helped safeguard the integrity of the educational institution.

4,Man allegedly rapes daughter-in-law,Suspect used videos to blackmail victim,"A man allegedly raped his daughter-in-law and later used the video footage to blackmail her.
Police said Sobia Bibi, a resident of 219 RB Kokian Wala, lodged a complaint stating that her daughter was married to Sajid on February 23 and did not return home after the wedding.
Sobia alleged that her father-in-law, Shaukat Ali sexually assaulted her during a visit on March 30, under the pretext of giving her Eidi.
The victim managed to escape while he was in the act. The Millat Town police have initiated a search for Shaukat Ali and have registered a case under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
In a separate incident, Subhan Ali from Geelani Mohalla, Jaranwala, reported that his cousin, a student at a private college in Jaranwala, was subjected to repeated sexual assaults by Muzamil from Mahmood Colony, Jaranwala. Muzamil allegedly intercepted the victim on his way to college, using weapons to coerce him into a residence where he recorded a video of the assault.
Muzamil then reportedly blackmailed the victim, threatening to release the video on social media unless he complied with his demands.
This led to the victim being extorted repeatedly for money, with the accused continuing to sexually assault him.
The police have filed a case against six suspects under sections 376, 292, and 337L2, and are actively working to apprehend them.
Meanwhile, in Muridwala, the body of a middle-aged man was discovered hanging from a tree, initially suggesting suicide.

5,Repairs at Gujranwala DHQ Teaching Hospital delayed,Government and medical college administration had given a date of March 31 to restore the hospital departments,"The emergency, outdoor and indoor and cardiac departments of DHQ Teaching Hospital have been closed for 5 months for repairs. While the completion date for finishing repairs has been postponed three times, the work is yet to be finished. While, the new date for completion has been set as 30 June. As a result, citizens are forced to seek treatment in private hospitals and clinics, despite DHQ Civil Hospital was a source of affordable treatment for the 25 lakh urban population of Gujranwala and the residents of hundreds of neighboring villages.
In November 2023, five departments of DHQ Civil Hospital were decommissioned for repairs. Later, all the departments including Emergency, ENT, Ophthalmology, Respiratory and Thoracic, TB, Orthopedic, Paediatrics, Maternal and Child, Radiology, Cardiology, Urgent Diseases, Gastroenterology, General Physician, Kidney and Bladder, and Surgery –in-door and out-doors– were shifted to the hospital adjacent to the medical college in Gondlanwala. This too proved to be an inconvenience for the people. The caretaker government and the district administration had claimed that all hospital departments would be restored by February 4, 2024, however, this did not happen. Next, the government and medical college administration had given a date of March 31 to restore the hospital departments, which also did not result in completion.
Now, citizens have to travel 17 kilometers for treatment and pay Rs500 to rickshaw pullers to go to the medical college. The district administration had claimed that a local transport route would also be allocated and shuttle service would be run to go from the city to the medical college. However, both the claims have not formalized yet.
Besides, shifting patients so far is a painful exercise, the date of three months later has been given again and the hospital is still closed. People suffering from heart, orthopedic, mental diseases cannot go that far and are forced to get treatment in the private sector by taking heavy loans.
In this regard, Principal Gujranwala Medical College Professor Dr. Raqbal Dogar said that C&W has been asked to speed up the work. The C&W team has visited the hospital and informed about the situation. According to latest updates, the date of June 30 has been given, but efforts will be made to transfer cardiology, radiology and other departments as soon as possible.
