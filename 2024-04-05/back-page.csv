0,"Don’t unilaterally decide migrants’ fate, Kabul urges","Asks Islamabad to not ""harass"" its citizens; FO insists policy on expulsion of illegal foreigners not ""Afghan specific"".","KABUL: Taliban authorities urged Pakistan on Thursday not to make a unilateral decision on repatriating Afghan migrants, saying they shouldn’t be “harassed”, after reports Islamabad would renew an eviction campaign.
Meanwhile, Pakistan denied the perception that the policy on expulsion of foreigners illegally residing in Pakistan was Afghan specific.
Since the announcement of the policy last year, amidst heightened TTP violence that further frayed the ties between Islamabad and Kabul, nearly 527,000 Afghans have returned to Afghanistan.
There are no reports that the government is planning to expand what it calls ‘Illegal Foreigners’ Repatriation Plan’ to Pakistan-issued Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders after Eidul Fitr and subsequently to UNHCR-issued Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders.

Asks Islamabad to not ‘harass’ its citizens; FO insists policy on expulsion of illegal foreigners not ‘Afghan specific’

At a weekly media briefing in Islamabad, Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch stayed short of confirming this, saying “several measures are under consideration and debate”.
“The issue of refugees is bilateral and decisions regarding them should be made through an understanding between both countries,” said Abdul Rahman Rashed, according to a ministry statement on social media platform X on Thursday.
“They shouldn’t be harassed until a joint mechanism is reached.”
Visa relaxation
Commenting on the reported relaxation of visa requirement for truckers involved in Pak-Afghan transit trade, FO spokesperson Baloch said there was no change in Pakistan’s position with respect to the one-document regime, which was still intact and the two sides had during Commerce Secretary Khurram Agha’s visit to Kabul agreed on a transition period for full implementation of the regime.
More than half a million Afghans fled Pakistan last year after the former government ordered undocumented migrants to leave or face arrest as Islamabad-Kabul relations soured over security.
Islamabad initially set a November 2023 deadline but official sources, who asked not to be identified, told AFP in March that Pakistan is gathering data on Afghan migrants ahead of a renewed push slated to start after Ramazan.
A final decision has not been made on a repatriation push, according to Pakistan officials, but the Afghan deputy minister for refugees urged restraint in a meeting with a top Pakistani diplomat in Kabul.
The Taliban authorities have urged Afghans to return home since taking power in 2021, but they also have condemned Pakistan’s actions, saying nationals are being punished for tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, and have called for people to be given more time to leave.
Millions of Afghans have poured into Pakistan over the decades, fleeing successive conflicts and political upheaval.

1,Taiwan rescuers struggle to reach scores trapped in tunnels,Families shelter in tents after apartments prove vulnerable to aftershocks.," 

HUALIEN (Taiwan): Rescue personnel search the rubble for the body of a missing hiker, in the country’s eastern region on Thursday.—AFP

HUALIEN: Taiwanese rescuers worked on Thursday to reach scores of people trapped in highway tunnels as engineers began a massive clear-up operation a day after the island’s biggest earthquake in a quarter of a century.
Relief workers set aside stuffed toys, blankets and baby formula for families sheltering in an elementary school in Hualien, the epicentre of the earthquake.
Ten people were killed and nearly 1,100 injured in Wednesday’s magnitude-7.4 quake, but strict building regulations and widespread public disaster awareness appear to have staved off a major catastrophe on the island.
Dozens of residents of the worst-hit city, Hualien, spent a night outdoors rather than in apartments still being shaken by aftershocks, and a huge engineering operation was underway to fix damaged roads and prop up tilting buildings.

Families shelter in tents after apartments prove vulnerable to aftershocks

Dramatic video released on Thursday by the island’s Central Emergency Operation Centre showed a helicopter flying two sorties to pluck up six miners trapped in a gypsum quarry in Hualien county.
Rescuers knew the whereabouts of dozens more people trapped in a network of strongly built tunnels in the county, a feature of the roads that cut through the scenic mountains and cliffs leading to Hualien City from the north and west.
Hundreds of others were holding out at a luxury hotel and youth activity centre near the Taroko National Park, with roads leading to both blocked by landslides.
“I also hope that we can use today’s time to find all people who are stranded and unaccounted for and help them settle down,” Premier Chen Chien-jen said after a briefing at an emergency operation centre in Hualien.
The island has been shaken by hundreds of strong aftershocks since the first quake, and the government warned people to be wary of landslides or rockfalls if they ventured to the countryside for Qingming, a two-day public holiday that began on Thursday.
Families traditionally visit the tombs of their ancestors on the holiday to clean the gravesites and burn offerings. “Do not go to the mountains unless necessary,” warned President Tsai Ing-wen.
‘Good to be alive’
The latest casualty, a 65-year-old man, was found on a hiking trail in Hualien county on Thursday afternoon.
Rescue workers deployed ropes to move the body on the uneven terrain filled with jagged rocks, according to footage released by officials.
Authorities were in contact with over 700 people trapped in tunnels or cut-off areas, but had lost touch with about a dozen — although they were believed to be safe.
At around 4pm, a highway leading to Taroko National Park was cleared. A small group stranded for nearly 30 hours emerged to be greeted by rescue workers handing them water and ushering some to the first aid tent.
“It’s good to be alive!” said David Chen, who works at the luxury Silks Place Taroko hotel located deeper in the mountains.
In Hualien, a glass-fronted building named Uranus — now tilting at a 45-degree angle after half of its first floor pancaked — has become something of a symbol of the quake.
Over 100 people chose to sleep in tents at a shelter set up in an elementary school as the aftershocks continued.
“Our worry is when the big aftershocks happen it might be really hard for us to evacuate one more time — especially with the baby,” said Indonesian Hendri Sutrisno, 30, a professor at Donghua University.
He and his wife hid under a table with their infant when the earthquake struck before fleeing their apartment.
“We have all the necessary stuff, blankets, (a) toilet and a place to rest,” he said.
Social media was awash with video and images from around the island shared by people who experienced Wednesday’s quake.
Wednesday’s quake was the most severe since 1999, when Taiwan was hit by a magnitude-7.6 temblor. It killed 2,400 people, the deadliest natural disaster in the island’s history.

2,Trump loses bid to delay hush money proceedings,Has pleaded not guilty in each of the four criminal indictments he faces.,"NEW YORK: A New York judge has denied Donald Trump’s bid to delay his April 15 trial on charges stemming from hush money paid to a porn star until the US Supreme Court reviews claim to presidential immunity in a separate criminal case.
The court is scheduled to hear the former US president’s arguments that he is immune from federal prosecution for trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democratic President Joe Biden on April 25.
His defence lawyers in the New York case in March asked Justice Juan Merchan to delay the trial until that review was complete, arguing it was relevant because prosecutors were seeking to present evidence of statements Trump made while he was president from 2017 to 2021.
In a court ruling on Wednesday, Merchan said Trump had waited too long to raise the issue. “Defendant had myriad opportunities to raise the claim of presidential immunity well before March 7, 2024,” Merchan wrote.
Todd Blanche, a lawyer for Trump, declined to comment.
Trump, the Republican candidate to challenge Biden in the Nov 5 election, has pleaded not guilty in each of the four criminal indictments he faces.
The New York case could be the only one to go to trial before the election.
He is accused of falsifying business records to cover up his former lawyer Michael Cohen’s $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in 2006.
Trump denies any such encounter with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.
Trump is also seeking a delay on the basis that a deluge of news coverage of the case has led potential jurors to believe he is already guilty.
Prosecutors with Manha­ttan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office, which charged Trump in 2023, opposed that request in a court filing made public on Wednesday.

3,Pakistani man convicted of UK cop’s murder,"Piran Ditta Khan, 75, had been wanted by British authorities since 2006.","LONDON: After two decades of evading justice, a Pakistani man was convicted on Thursday of murdering a UK police officer in 2005.
PC Sharon Beshenivsky was a 38-year-old mother of three who was shot dead outside a travel agency in Bradford while responding to an armed robbery call. She was shot at point blank range.
Piran Ditta Khan, 75, who has been wanted by British authorities since 2006, was found guilty at Leeds Crown Court after previously pleading guilty to robbery. He was the last of seven men involved in the robbery to be convicted.
Khan was convicted of murder by a majority of 10-1 after 11 jurors deliberated for almost 19 hours over four days. He was also found guilty of two counts of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, also by a majority of 10-1. He was unanimously convicted of two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon.
The incident unfolded on Nov 18, 2005, when Sharon Beshenivsky and PC Teresa Milburn responded to an alarm call at a travel agency on Morley Street in Bradford. Upon arrival, they were met with gunfire by three assailants, resulting in Beshenivsky’s fatal shooting and injuries to Milburn.
Prosecutors said former takeaway boss Khan was the group’s ringleader and, although he did not leave the safety of a lookout car during the raid, he played a “pivotal” role in planning it and knew that loaded firearms were to be used.
They told jurors this made him guilty of Beshenivsky’s murder “as surely as if he had pulled the trigger on that pistol himself”.
He was the only one of the group who was familiar with Universal Express and had used them in the past to send money to family in Pakistan, the court heard.
Khan told jurors he had no knowledge that a robbery was going to be carried out, or that weapons were going to be taken. He claimed the business’s owner, Mohammmad Yousaf, owed him £12,000 and that debt collector Hassan Razzaq offered to get his money back after the pair met through a business associate.
Khan said he thought the men Razzaq sent would “intimidate” the staff at Universal Express, or at worst, “slap them”.
Prosecutor Robert Smith KC said Khan’s claim of being defrauded was an “entirely false” attempt to explain why he was in Bradford at the time of the robbery and murder.
Jurors heard Khan, who was living in Enfield, London, at the time, was driven to Yorkshire by Razzaq on a reconnaissance trip five days before the raid.
The day before the robbery, they travelled up again to a “safe house” in Leeds where they spent the night.
Francois Baron, who was working on renovating the house, later told police he had heard the robbers discussing the plot in one of the bedrooms.
Mr Baron said he heard gunman Muzzaker Shah asking Khan: “Uncle, is it safe?” Khan was said to have replied: “Yes, it’s safe. Genuine.”
Jurors heard Shah asked: “How much can we get?” and Khan replied: “Minimum £50,000, maximum target 100 grand.”
The group were said to be “elated” and “confident,” shouting: “Let’s go do it.”
Khan fled to Pakistan two months after the murder to evade capture and remained free till he was apprehended in 2020 in Islamabad. While there, his lawyer said Khan wanted to be tried in his home country.
Despite the absence of an extradition treaty, the CPS, National Crime Agency, and Pakistani authorities worked together to facilitate Khan’s return to the UK in April 2023, where he was arrested and charged.

4,IMF to finalise release of final instalment this month,"PM Shehbaz says new loan programme ""very important to consolidate economy"".","WASHINGTON / ISLAMABAD: An official of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Wednesday that the IMF board will finalise the release of its last tranche to Pakistan by the end of this month.
In July 2023, the IMF’s executive board approved a nine-month, $3 billion Stand-By Arrangement for Pakistan to support the country’s economic stabilisation programme.
On March 20, the IMF and Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement on the second and final review under the arrangement, subject to the approval of the IMF’s executive board. Upon approval, Pakistan will have access to around $1.1bn.
Asked at a virtual news briefing on Wednesday about the status of the Fund’s negotiations with Pakistan, IMF’s Communication Director Julie Kozack said the executive board will meet by the end of this month and finalise the release of its second and final tranche.

PM Shehbaz says new loan programme ‘very important to consolidate economy’

She pointed out that the two sides had already reached a staff-level agreement and the IMF believed that confidence in Pakis­tan’s economy was being restored. So, the board will finalise its decision at the next meeting, she added.
Earlier on Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed hope that the IMF will release the last tranche of $1.1bn under the existing standby arrangement this month.
Addressing a meeting of the federal cabinet, he said his government was planning to enter a new programme with the IMF, which was “very important to consolidate the economy”.
PIA privatisation
Regarding PIA’s privatisation, the premier told the meeting that the process was on track and the timeline set for the process would be strictly followed.
On the issue of outsourcing airports’ operation, PM Shehbaz said a Turkish company was arriving in Islamabad on April 6 to negotiate terms of the outsourcing process with Pakistani authorities.
He also told the meeting that the Federal Board of Revenue would appoint consultants for the digitisation of the tax collection process by the month end.
The prime minister also gave a briefing on the recently held meeting of the Special Investment Facilitation Council in which issues of various sectors, including finance, investment, exports, IT, agriculture, power and petroleum were discussed.

5,Universe’s accelerated expansion might be slowing down,"For more than a century, scientists have known that the universe started expanding after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago.","PARIS: The universe is still expanding at an accelerating rate, but it may have slowed down recently compared to a few billion years ago, early results from the most precise measurement of its evolution yet suggested Thursday.
While the preliminary findings are far from confirmed, if they hold up it would further deepen the mystery of dark energy — and likely mean there is something important missing in our understanding of the cosmos.
These signals of our universe’s changing speeds were spotted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which is perched atop a telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in the US state of Arizona.
Each of the instrument’s 5,000 fibre-optic robots can observe a galaxy for 20 minutes, allowing astronomers to chart what they have called the largest-ever 3D map of the universe.

Scientists have been able to map six million galaxies and quasars using light that stretches up to 11 billion years into the universe’s past

“We measured the position of the galaxies in space but also in time, because the further away they are, the more we go back in time to a younger and younger universe,” Arnaud de Mattia, a co-leader of the DESI data interpretation team, told AFP.
Just one year into its five-year survey, DESI has already drawn up a map which includes six million galaxies and quasars using light that stretches up to 11 billion years into the universe’s past.
The results were announced at conferences in the United States and Switzerland on Thursday, ahead of a series of scientific papers being published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics.
DESI is on a mission to shed light on the nature of dark energy — a theoretical phenomenon thought to make up roughly 70 percent of the universe.
Another 25 percent of the universe is composed of the equally mysterious dark matter, leaving just five percent of normal matter — such as everything you can see.
An inconstant constant?
For more than a century, scientists have known that the universe started expanding after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago.
But in the late 1990s, astronomers were shocked to discover it has been expanding at an ever-increasing rate.
This was a surprise because gravity from matter — both normal and dark — was thought to have been slowing the universe down.
But obviously something was making the universe expand at ever-faster speeds, and the name “dark energy” was given to this force.
More recently, it was discovered that the acceleration of the universe significantly sped up around six billion years after the Big Bang.
In the push-and-pull between matter and dark energy, the latter certainly seems to have the upper hand, according to the leading model of the universe called the Lambda CDM.
Under this model, the quickening expansion of the universe is called the “cosmological constant,” which is closely linked to dark energy.
DESI director Michael Levi said that so far, the instrument’s early results were showing “basic agreement with our best model of the universe”.
“But we’re also seeing some potentially interesting differences which could indicate that dark energy is evolving with time,” Levi said in a statement.
In other words, the data “seems to show that the cosmological constant Lambda is not really a constant,” because dark energy would be displaying “dynamic” and changing behaviour, De Mattia said.
Slowing down in old age
This could suggest that — after switching into high gear six billion years after the Big Bang — the speed at which the universe has been expanding has been “slowing down in recent times,” DESI researcher Christophe Yeche said.
Whether dark energy does in fact change over time would need to be verified by more data from DESI and other instruments, such as the space telescope Euclid.
But if it was confirmed, our understanding of the universe will likely have to be changed to accommodate for this strange behaviour.
For example, the cosmological constant could be replaced by some kind of field linked to some as-yet-unknown particle.
It could even necessitate updating the equations of Einstein’s theory of relativity “so that they behave slightly differently on the scale of large structures,” De Mattia said. But we are not there yet.
The history of science is full of examples in which “deviations of this type have been observed then resolved over time,” De Mattia emphasised.
After all, Einstein’s theory of relativity has withstood more than a century of scientific poking and prodding and still stands stronger than ever.
