0,Myanmar capital comes under rare drone attack by anti-junta fighters,"YANGON: Opponents of Myanmar’s junta launched a drone attack on the military-built capital Naypyidaw on Thursday,...","YANGON: Opponents of Myanmar’s junta launched a drone attack on the military-built capital Naypyidaw on Thursday, they and the junta said, in a rare attack on the military’s centre of power.
The ouster of Aung San Suu Kyi’s democratically elected government in a 2021 coup sparked renewed fighting with ethnic minority armed groups, as well as with pro-democracy “Peoples Defence Forces” (PDFs) in areas previously untouched by decades of conflict.
The junta said that “terrorists” — as it terms the PDF — had targeted “important buildings and departments” with 13 fixed-wing drones.
Two drones were destroyed in the air and the rest were downed, the junta’s information team said in a statement, adding that four had been carrying explosives.
Those four were destroyed in controlled explosions, it said, adding that the attack had caused no casualties or damage.
The “national unity government” (NUG), dominated by lawmakers ousted in the coup who are now working to topple the junta, said it had carried out the attack with a local PDF.
Naypyidaw’s airport was temporarily closed after the incident around 10am local time (0330 GMT), according to a source at the airport.
The source confirmed there were no casualties there, adding that one of the downed drones was carrying a bomb that was later defused.
Pictures released by the junta’s information team purportedly of the aftermath showed nine broken fixed-wing drones lying on display, and a large piece of debris in a wooded area.
Local media reported that a PDF group in the area said it had launched drones at military targets in Naypyidaw.
The NUG said on Facebook that the attack had targeted the military’s headquarters and a military air base in Naypyidaw, adding that “initial reports” suggested there had been casualties.
It did not provide details or say what kind of drones had been used in the attack.
The junta statement did not give details on the buildings or locations it thought had been targeted.
‘Drop bombs’
Outgunned and outnumbered, opponents of the junta have increasingly taken drones into their arsenal, with devastating effect.
Many groups operate commercial drones adapted to carry bombs that can be dropped on military positions.
In recent months, waves of such “drop bomb” attacks across Myanmar have displaced junta troops from positions, hit domestic airports and killed a brigadier-general near the China border.
The term has even entered the lexicon of junta-controlled media, which regularly attacks PDF groups that use the drones in battle.

1,Iraqi man behind desecration faces extradition,Momika’s actions burnings sparked widespread outrage and condemnation across the Muslim world.,"OSLO: An Iraqi refugee in Sweden who stoked international outrage by repeatedly desecrating the Holy Quran last year, has been arrested in Norway and now faces deportation back to Sweden, according to court documents.
Salwan Momika, a Christian Iraqi who burned copies of the holy book at a slew of protests in Sweden over the summer, told AFP last week that he had left Sweden for Norway, where he planned to seek asylum.
According to a ruling by the Oslo District Court, Momika was arrested on March 28 — a day after he arrived. After a hearing on March 30, the court decided to detain Momika for four weeks, awaiting a likely request from the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration to Sweden that he is returned.
In the court’s ruling, it said “a deportation will take place as soon as the formal and practical arrangements are in place.”
Police had requested that he would be detained in the meantime, citing the country’s migration law when it can be assumed that a foreign national will attempt to evade the implementation of a decision for him to leave the country.
Momika’s actions burnings sparked widespread outrage and condemnation across the Muslim world.
Iraqi protesters stormed the Swedish embassy in Baghdad twice in July, starting fires within the compound on the second occasion.
The Swedish government condemned the acts of desecration, but stressed the country’s laws regarding freedom of speech and assembly.

2,Magnitude-6.0 quake shakes northeast Japan,"TEPCO, the operator of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, said “no abnormalities” had been detected","TOKYO: A magnitude-6.0 earthquake struck off northeastern Japan’s Fukushima region on Thursday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said, but no tsunami warning was issued.
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries after the earthquake, whose epicentre had a depth of 40 kilometres (25 miles) and which was also felt in Tokyo.
TEPCO, the operator of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, said “no abnormalities” had been detected at the stricken plant or others in the region.
Japan, one of the world’s most tectonically active countries, has strict building standards designed to ensure structures can withstand even the most powerful earthquakes.
The archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year, the vast majority of which are mild.
The United States Geological Survey put the magnitude of Thursday’s quake at 6.1, with a depth of 40.1 kilometres.
It comes a day after at least nine people were killed and more than 1,000 injured by a powerful earthquake in Taiwan.
Wednesday’s magnitude-7.4 quake damaged dozens of buildings in Taiwan and prompted tsunami warnings as far as Japan and the Philippines.

3,"Academic freedom declining globally, index finds","Significant declines were particularly seen in India, China and Russia.","PARIS: Just one in three people live in a nation that guarantees the independence of universities and research, according to an annual index warning that academic freedom is declining worldwide, particularly in Russia, China and India.
Attacks on freedom of expression, interference at universities and the imprisonment of researchers are just some ways that “academic freedom globally is under threat”, the index said.
The Academic Freedom Index — based on input from more than 2,300 experts in 179 countries — was published last month as part of a report on democracy by the V-Dem Institute at Sweden’s University of Gothenburg.
It measures changes in higher education and research over the last half century by looking at five different indicators: freedom of research and teaching; of academic exchange; of academic and cultural expression; of institutional autonomy and campus integrity.
Significant declines were particularly seen in India, China and Russia — the first, second and ninth most populous nations — which Kinzelbach called “clear examples of autocratisation”.
Katrin Kinzelbach, a professor at Germany’s University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and one of the organisers of the index, said 171 states had ratified a human rights treaty which commits them to respect the freedom of scientific research.
But because of recent “significant deteriorations” in countries with large populations, “only every third person in the world today lives in a country where research and higher education enjoys a high degree of freedom”, she said.

4,ALS drug withdrawn after it fails in trial,The company also said it was reducing its workforce “by approximately 70 percent” as it focused on other drugs.,"WASHINGTON: Amylyx Pharmaceuticals announced Thursday it was withdrawing its approved treatment against the deadly neurodegenerative disease ALS after clinical data found no evidence the drug worked.
In a statement, the US company said it would discontinue its market authorizations for Relyvrio/Albrioza, using the brand names of the medicine in the US and Canadian markets.
“While this is a difficult moment for the ALS community, we reached this path forward in partnership with the stakeholders who will be impacted and in line with our steadfast commitment to people living with ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases,” said the company’s co-CEOs in a statement.
The company also said it was reducing its workforce “by approximately 70 percent” as it focused on other drugs. The news follows data from a clinical trial of 664 ALS patients announced in March, which found no significant differences in outcomes between those on the treatment group and those who received a placebo.
It was a big blow for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, sometimes called Lou Gehrig’s disease after the famous baseball player, which devastates nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.
ALS affects about two people per 100,000 every year, causing progressive loss of motor and cognitive function. Most patients die within five years of their diagnosis. For now, there remain only a handful of treatments available.

5,From Cold War to the Ukraine war — Nato turns 75,The organisation was forged in the Cold War and re-energised by Russia’s war on Ukraine.,"BRUSSELS: The Nato military alliance on Thursday marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of its founding treaty in Washington.
Here are some facts and figures about the organisation forged in the Cold War and re-energised by Russia’s war on Ukraine.
From 12 to 32 members
Just 12 countries were founder members of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949 as the United States, Canada and much of western Europe clubbed together to face up to the threat of former World War II ally the Soviet Union.
In 1952, often uncomfortable neighbours Turkey and Greece joined, before West Germany became a member three years later.
After the end of the Cold War, Nato went through several waves of enlargement that saw its border with Russia grow with the inclusion of Poland and the former Baltic states.
After Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022, Nordic neighbours Sweden and Finland reversed long-standing policies of non-alignment.
9/11
Nato has only ever once triggered its Article Five collective-defence clause —which says an attack on one member is considered an attack on all — after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.
The fall-out from 9/11 saw Nato get involved in Afghanistan where it remained until 2021, when a calamitous US-led withdrawal allowed the Taliban to take back power.
Two per cent of GDP
In response to Russia’s seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, Nato allies agreed they would aim to spend two percent of their GDPs on defence.
That goal was raised after Moscow launched its all-out invasion of its neighbour in 2022 to having two percent as a minimum.
France’s tenuous relationship
No country has ever withdrawn from Nato, but France spent almost 43 years outside its military command structure after then president Charles de Gaulle pulled out in 1966 complaining of US domination.
The decision — which saw Nato move its headquarters from Paris to Brussels — was only reversed by former president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2009.
Nonetheless, France’s sometimes strained relationship with Nato continues.

ROME: A view of the new water feature installed at the Baths of Caracalla which reflects the ancient Roman ruins like a mirror. The baths were the city’s second largest public baths, likely built during the reigns of emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla.—AFP

 
ROME: The Baths of Caracalla, one of Rome’s most spectacular sites, unveiled a special pool on Thursday that reflects the majestic ruins, in an interplay of the contemporary and ancient.
The pool, called “Lo Specchio” (The Mirror), measures 42 metres by 32 metres (138 feet by 105 feet), creating a sparkling surface for the reflection of the remains of one of antiquity’s largest bath complexes.
Cultural officials said they were not trying to recreate one of Caracalla’s many baths, but rather to evoke the spirit of the site.
“The return of water is not only a wonder for its own sake, a joy for the eyes and the spirit, but is meant to be a concrete symbol of reconnection with the ancient world,” said Daniela Porro, special superintendent for cultural affairs in Rome.
The addition of the contemporary architecture “harmonises with the ancient one, to consolidate the role of the Baths of Caracalla as a centre promoting culture and art”.
Water jets and spotlights installed at the bottom of the pool create a play of water and light, suggesting the steam of the ancient baths.
A stage can be placed over the water for theatre and dance performances or concerts, officials said.
The installation opens to the general public on April 13 with a new ballet set to George Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue.

7,Online hate sows fears among Muslims in India,"HALDWANI: After his brother was murdered in anti-Muslim riots, Pervez Qureshi watched the videos he believes incited...","HALDWANI: After his brother was murdered in anti-Muslim riots, Pervez Qureshi watched the videos he believes incited the killers, part of a wave of hatred being fomented on social media before India’s elections.
Analysts warn increasingly available modern technology is being used to deliberately exploit divisions.
“Videos and messages were shared on Facebook and WhatsApp which contained inflammatory language and incitement to violence,” Qureshi said, recalling the attack on his brother Faheem in February in Haldwani, Uttarakhand state.
“It poisoned the atmosphere.”
Nearly 550 million more Indians now have access to the internet than when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power a decade ago, according to figures from the Internet and Mobile Association of India.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is widely expected to win a third term in elections that begin on April 19.
‘Atmosphere of hatred’
But critics accuse the BJP’s sophisticated social media apparatus of also fanning the flames of division.
Haldwani community leader Islam Hussain said tensions were already high before February’s violence, after months of incendiary social media posts calling Muslims “outsiders”.
“It was said that due to the increasing population of Muslims, the social demography of Uttarakhand is changing”, he said. “Right-wing social media cells have a big role in creating an atmosphere of hatred against Muslims.” Clashes erupted after the authorities said a mosque had been built illegally, and a Muslim group gathered to prevent its demolition.
Hindu residents gathered to cheer on the police clampdown, chanting religious slogans and throwing rocks at the crowd.
Footage of the riots spread swiftly on social media. Egged on by online calls to mobilise, Hindu mobs rampaged through the streets.
Qureshi said his brother Faheem, 32, was killed by Hindu neighbours after they first torched his car.
‘Triggers an incident’
But Saini, coordinator for the BJP’s youth wing, said the online team he leads does not encourage violence — and is under strict instruction not to “write anything against anyone’s religion”.
He said his colleagues had mobilised quickly on the day riots broke out to provide information, not to stir up trouble.
“When we got the news, we immediately started preparing graphics, videos and text messages to reach people with the correct and accurate information related to the incident,” he said.
According to him, the initial violence was clashes between police and a Muslim group — and blamed Modi’s opponents for instigating riots to tarnish the government’s image.
But critics disagree. Raqib Hameed Naik, from research group Hindutva Watch, said that the BJP’s IT cell had generated anger towards minorities, by promoting the government’s Hindu-nationalist agenda.

8,UK judges join calls for halt to Israeli arms sales,Say provision of military assistance may render Britain complicit in Gaza genocide,"LONDON: Three former Supreme Court justices have joined more than 600 members of the British legal profession in calling for the government to halt arms sales to Israel, saying it could make Britain complicit in genocide in Gaza.
Their call was also backed by two of the country’s leading intelligence experts, who argued that Britain needed to use any leverage it could to persuade Israel, and its biggest backer the United States, to change course in the conflict.
The British government has been a staunch ally of Israel since the eruption of hostilities on Oct 7, but Foreign Secretary David Cameron has hardened his language in recent months over the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
Cameron said on March 8 that Israel had to be compliant with international humanitarian law in order for Britain to grant export licences allowing arms sales to Israel, and that a judgement on that was underway and due in the “coming days”.

Say provision of military assistance may render Britain complicit in Gaza genocide

The Foreign Office said on Thursday it kept advice on Israel’s adherence to the law under review but that the content of government advice was confidential.
Senior members of Britain’s legal profession said the government needed to halt sales now to avoid “aiding and assisting an international wrongful act”.
“The provision of military assistance and material to Israel may render the UK complicit in genocide as well as serious breaches of International Humanitarian Law,” the judges, barristers and legal academics said in a 17-page letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
One of the former justices, Jonathan Sumption, told BBC Radio that he was concerned the British government had lost sight of its own obligations under international law.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called any suggestion of genocide as “outrageous”, and has said Israel has an “unwavering commitment to international law”.
Resisting pressure
Sunak has resisted calls to immediately halt weapons sales to Israel, saying the government adheres to a “very careful licensing regime”.
But the killing of seven aid workers, including three British nationals, in Israeli airstrikes this week has ratcheted up the pressure. Israel said they were mistakenly killed.
Britain licences the sale of British-made explosive devices, assault rifles and components for military aircraft to Israel but it is a relatively small supplier, with Israeli exports making up about 0.4 per cent of Britain’s total global defence sales in 2022, the last full-year data was available.
Two senior figures in Britain’s intelligence community — former national security adviser Peter Ricketts and Alex Younger, the former head of the MI6 foreign spy service — have said those sales should be used as leverage.

9,"Israel wrecking Gaza healthcare, says MSF",The MSF says deadly attacks on humanitarian staff showed either deliberate intent or reckless incompetence.,"

GENEVA: Israel is systematically destroying Gaza’s healthcare system, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Thursday, describing scenes of carnage that no hospitals in the world would be able to handle.
The medical charity said children were turning up in hospitals with gunshot wounds from drones, while many patients were being crushed under rubble then suffering severe burns.
The MSF said deadly attacks on humanitarian staff showed either deliberate intent or reckless incompetence. Amber Alayyan, MSF deputy programme manager for the Middle East, said the healthcare system in Gaza before Oct­ober was imperfect but robust and improving.
“Now we’re seeing the systematic and deliberate destruction of the healthcare system,” she told a press conference at MSF’s headquarters in Geneva.
Alayyan said the vast majority of injuries seen by MSF medics in Gaza were explosive injuries: the effects of bombs hitting homes.
“You get crush injuries to the abdomen, to the thorax; amputations are required for the legs and arms; and on top of that, patients suffer severe burns,” she said.
“No healthcare system in the world can cope with the volume and type of injuries, and the medical conditions, that we’re seeing on a daily basis.
“You could add 1,000 field hospitals; you’re not going to be able to replace the healthcare system that was in Gaza before the war.”
“We see gunshot wounds now in children from quadcopters — drones with guns,” she added.
The MSF said Israel was acting with impunity in the Palestinian territory, adding the UN Security Council’s call for a ceasefire needed to be backed up with action.
MSF International’s secretary general Chri­stopher Lockyear said nearly 200 humanitarian workers had been killed in Gaza, including five MSF staffers.
“This pattern of attacks is either intentional or indicative of reckless incompetence,” he told reporters in Geneva, calling it “a war fought with no rules”.
He said Israel allowing the attacks to happen was “a political choice” because “Israel faces no political cost”.
“Instead, its allies enable this brutality with impunity and provide even more weapons.”
He said all states supporting Israel were “morally and politically complicit”.

Russian forces have stepped up their aerial bombardments in recent weeks, with Zelensky calling nearly daily for his Western backers to deliver air defence systems to save Ukrainian lives.
“A few air defence systems could fundamentally change the situation,” Zelensky said in an evening address posted on social media.
“It is totally unacceptable that so many countries in the world are still thinking about how to counter terror, even though only a few political decisions are needed,” he said.
Drone attacks on Ukr­aine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv killed four people, including three rescuers responding to an earlier strike, Interior Min­ister Igor Klymenko said.
Twelve others were injured in what Zelensky termed a “despicable and cynical attack”. “When the rescuers arrived at the scene of the strike, the terrorists attacked again,” he said.
In a separate incident, Russian artillery fire killed two — a married couple aged 53 and 51 — in the town of New York, eastern Donetsk region.

Police described the daring heist as one of the largest cash thefts in the city’s history. It took place on Easter Sunday in the northern suburb of Sylmar.
The Los Angeles said burglars busted through a roof to access the building’s vault, somehow evading a sophisticated alarm system.
The elaborate and complex theft appeared to be the work of an experienced crew, and was only discovered on Monday when staff opened the vault, the newspaper said.

12,Drones deliver food to French prisoners,"Inmates from late 2022 to December 2023 had been making orders via social media app Snapchat, paying an average of 450 euros.","PARIS: In the dead of night a drone hovers over a prison in southern France, secretly dropping packages to inmates inside. But one parcel becomes stuck in the railing outside a cell window, and guards seize three others.
Across France, prisoners have been making orders online for drones to illegally bring them everything from drugs and phones to their favourite fast food, often just outside their window.
The botched delivery in southern France in early 2023 led authorities to bring down a business called “Drone2France” that had been delivering goods to more than a dozen prisons in France and Belgium.
Inmates from late 2022 to December 2023 had been making orders via social media app Snapchat, paying an average of 450 euros ($490) per package, weighing a maximum 350 grammes.
The service provider required a minimum order of four packages per delivery, and they often fell from the drone’s claws in potato sacks.
Another setup called “Air Colis” ( “Air parcel “), busted in western France in September, lowered down contraband stuffed in socks on the end of fishing line.
And in another incident in southern France, authorities found parcels containing more than 100 grammes of cocaine and 700 grammes of cannabis.
Hundreds of such deliveries are made a year, prison guards say.
“There isn’t a day when there isn’t a drone flying over, whether on the mainland or in overseas territories,” said Dominique Gombert of prison guard union FO Justice.
Last year, more than 1,000 drones were detected in flight over penitentiaries, 400 of which were “blocked”, a source close to the case said.
Cannabis and kebabs
The prisons authority did not reply to a request from AFP for comment, but union representatives provided details of how the drone deliveries worked.
Wilfried Fonck, the secretary-general of another prison guard union called Ufap-Unsa Justice, said the deliveries were becoming increasingly precise.
“They make it almost right up to a window,” Fonck said.
Most orders are for cannabis and mobile phones, but also kebabs, spicy sausages, ceramic knives or religious books, he explained.
Delivery services advertise directly on social media and can pick up the goods from an inmate’s friend or relative.
Most drones are the smaller ones sold online, which is why packages cannot be too heavy.
The drone operator is usually located within a radius of two to five kilometres (1.2 to three miles) from the prison, with accomplices on the lookout.
The drone often flies with all its lights off, guided by a light the inmate shines out of their window.
The detainee then only needs to stretch their arm through the bars to catch the goods.
With less guards at nighttime, there is less chance of being caught.
“At most, you can conduct surprise searches the next morning,” Fonck said.
But that was often complicated because those storing the contraband were often the more discreet inmates.
