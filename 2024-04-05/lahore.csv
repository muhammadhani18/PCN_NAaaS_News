1,Stroke centres established at 12 hospitals across Punjab,Unhealthy food habits among causes of ischemic stroke.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has established 12 provincial stroke management centres (PSMCs) at the major teaching hospitals across the province for the timely diagnosis and treatment of ischemic stroke patients.
These facilities were not available in Punjab except one at the Services Hospital Lahore, which was unable to cater to the needs of a large number of stroke patients of the province.
Following the need to provide life-saving health facilities, the Punjab government designated four major hospitals in Lahore and eight in other main cities to treat the stroke patients.
In Lahore, the critical facility would now be provided at the Services Hospital Lahore, Mayo Hospital, Sir Ganga Ram and one dedicated center at the Punjab Institute of Neuro Sciences (PINS) Lahore while in other cities, it would be available at the Allied Hospital Faisalabad, Nishtar Hospital Multan, Allama Iqbal Memorial Teaching Hospital Sialkot, Shaikh Zayed Hospital Rahim Yar Khan, Holy Family Hospital Rawalpindi, DHQ Hospital Gujranwala, DHQ Hospital Narowal and Bahawal Victoria Hospital Bahawalpur.

Unhealthy food habits among causes of stroke

The PSMCs were established at the teaching institutes having neurology units and functional CT scan facilities where the dedicated teams of doctors would be available to attend to the patients and start treatment within four hours of the onset of the ischemic stroke.
 
 

Talking to Dawn, the head of department of neurology at the Services Institute of Medical Sciences (SIMS), Prof Dr Qasim Bashir, threw light on the project.
He said a stroke patient’s son donated USD 100,000 when he realised the importance of the disease and the timely treatment provided by the doctors to help establish the stroke centres in Punjab.
Meanwhile, he said, Punjab Health Secretary Ali Jan also supported and provided funds, logistic support and the facilities at 12 hospitals.
“The PSMCs strive to empower healthcare professionals and the public to recognise stroke early, minimise disability through a swift emergency response network, ensuring rapid access to free life-saving treatment while also prompting stroke research across the province.”
Dr Qasim said that under the project, the Rescue 1122 personnel had been trained to play an important role to shift the stroke patients to the designated centres where a team of the doctors would be available to start timely diagnosis and treatment.
He said the centres would provide free of cost the most demanded and costly injection tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a powerful agent that dissolves blood clots.
“It is injected by intravenous administration (IV) for emergency stroke treatment,” he said and added that a stroke could be caused by an interruption in blood flow either due to a blood clot (ischemic stroke) or a bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke) in the brain.
Prof Qasim said that all the centres had been interlinked to obtain, for the first time, a reliable data bank of stroke patients in Punjab. This data bank would help the Punjab health department authorities for the resource allocation, he said, adding that all age group people, particularly adults and young people, were at the risk of stroke due to the unhygienic food habits.
To a question, he said energy drinks were contributing a lot to creating serious health risks and suggested to the parents to take care of their kids in this respect to avoid the onset of the stroke.
Meanwhile, Punjab Minister for Health Khawaja Salman Rafique attended the opening ceremony of a PSMC at the Services Institute of Medical Sciences auditorium on Thursday.
Punjab Secretary Emergency Services Dr Rizwan Naseer, Principal Sims Professor Dr. Zohra Khanum, Executive Director Punjab Institute of Neurosciences Prof. Dr Asif Bashir, Prof Dr Jodat Saleem and other senior
medical teachers were present on the occasion.

A jail official informed the courts that Mr Elahi had broken four ribs after he fell in the washroom of his cell. He said the doctors had advised the former chief minister against travel.
Mr Elahi and other suspects were scheduled to be indicted in cases of illegal appointments in the Punjab Assembly by a special court for anti-corruption and receiving kickbacks for releasing development funds by an accountability court. 
Both courts adjourned the hearing till April 18.
Other suspects, including Muhammad Khan Bhatti, former principal secretary to the CM, were produced before the courts.
The Anti-Corruption Establish-ment alleged that illegal appointments of BS-17 posts were made in the provincial assembly when Mr Elahi was the chief minister and Mr Bhatti was his principal secretary. It said favourite candidates were appointed to the posts despite being declared failed in the written examination.
In the other case, the NAB alleged that Bhatti being the principal secretary to then chief minister Elahi maneuvered the award of contracts in favour of blue-eyed contractors in connivance with other suspects, including officials of government departments.
It said the suspect had released full payment to the contractors even before the commencement of construction work only to receive kickbacks.
The bureau alleged that money from the corruption committed by Bhatti had been transferred into the bank accounts of Mr Elahi and his son Moonis Elahi.

The cabinet committee met in the Punjab Assembly, presided over by Food Minister Bilal Yasin. School Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat, education secretary, additional home secretary, DIG special branch and officers from different education boards were also present. 
Mr Yasin said all institutions and individuals involved in the class-IX examination process should be more vigilant. 
The cabinet body was formed after reports of cheating and serious irregularities in the examination process from several districts, including Lahore. 
Mr Yasin said that appointment of private invigilators in the examinations and reports of corruption were a question mark on the efficiency of the administration. He said all examination centres inspected by the provincial ministers were showing irregularities. 
He said the management’s reports were contrary to facts brought out by government’s undercover teams. He said private invigilators caught red-handed doing corruption would be behind bars. 
He said the mistakes should not be repeated in future exams and administration should ensure the best arrangements. 
Mr Hayat said the money extorted from candidates should be recovered. 
“The administration has been directed to implement a zero-tolerance policy regarding cheating in all future examinations. It is recommended that cases should be registered against the people arrested at examination centers under 16 MPO,” he said. 
Consideration was also given to installing cameras in examination rooms for the future and recommendations were sought from all stakeholders to formulate a comprehensive policy regarding future examinations. 
The government has sacked 93 private invigilators at the Lawrence Road centre and got registered cases against them for facilitating cheating. 
Several students complained that they were being asked for bribes for a favour in solving the paper.

With violence against women, children and transpersons showing no signs of abatement, HRCP has recommended strengthening the Punjab Commission on the Status of Women, instituting more effective child protection mechanisms and legislating to raise the age for marriage to 18 years.
 






Threats to religious freedoms must also be addressed by implementing the 2014 Supreme Court judgment in letter and spirit and taking steps to penalise false accusations of blasphemy.
Existing labour laws and regulations related to inspections, safety protocols and wages must be implemented to protect vulnerable workers.
Tactics to repress dissent, such as arbitrary raids and detentions and undeclared curbs on press freedom, must end.
Women and other political prisoners must also be released immediately, and the state must legislate to restore student unions.

7,Report notes use of AI for violence against women,Women constitute 58.5pc of complainants while transgender community also subjected to an orchestrated online hate campaign.,"LAHORE: A report has found a surge in the technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV) in Pakistan in 2023 with nearly 2,500 cases reported in the year with significant rise of such complaints by women and marginalised groups.
The year saw another alarming trend, i.e. the use of generative AI content for violence against women in the public sphere near the general elections.
The annual cyber harassment helpline report 2023 was released by the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF).
 
 

The seventh annual report by the foundation showed a total of 2,473 complaints on its helpline with an average number of 206 each month.
The report is a compilation of the data from complaints received by the DRF helpline through its toll-free number (0800-39393), email and social media platforms.
In a press release, DRF Executive Director Nighat Dad noted that a significant rise of complaints relating to the TFGBV against women and marginalised groups was reported during 2023.
She said the instances of violence were also leading to a rise in the potential offline violence for these groups. She said the helpline noted another alarming thing that the use of generative AI content was being used to exacerbate violence against women in the public sphere near the general elections, particularly against women journalists.
“These growing numbers are alarming and show how online spaces are perpetuating identity-based attacks on women and marginalised groups.”
Ms Dad stressed the need for urgent redress and protection for survivors facing the TFGBV with holistic support from the state institutions within the country.
The women were the main victims of online harassment constituting 58.5pc of the complainants while the transgender community was also subjected to an orchestrated online hate campaign. Helpline manager Hyra Basit said they had seen how the manifestation of the TFGBV had evolved over the years, with rising complaints of incredible privacy violations of women via unregulated apps and the use of modern editing and generative AI to produce non-consensual intimate images (NCII).
The report highlighted that the highest number of complaints received in 2023 were from Punjab (1,724), followed by Sindh (261) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (112).
It also includes a set of recommendations for policymakers and the law enforcement agencies regarding online harassment cases.
