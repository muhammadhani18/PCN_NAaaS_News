0,Doctors find no sign of poisoning during Bushra’s examination,"Shaukat Khanum, Pims doctors say she is ""perfectly alright""; Raoof Hasan claims no lab in Pakistan can detect slow poisoning.","ISLAMABAD: A team of doctors who examined and collected samples from former first lady Bushra Bibi in Banigala on Thursday have found no symptoms of slow poisoning in her body, according to one of the doctors who was part of the medical team.
The medical team inclu­ded doctors from Islama­bad’s Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) and the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital in Lahore.
Ms Bibi’s lab samples were collected days after she, her husband Imran Khan and several PTI leaders claimed that the former first lady had been slow poisoned in the sub-jail, where she is serving her prison sentence in the Toshakhana reference.
Talking to media persons, Shaukat Khanum Hospital’s Chief Medical Officer Dr Asim Yousuf said Ms Bibi has not been tested for slow poisoning and there were no symptoms of the same.

Shaukat Khanum, Pims doctors say she is ‘perfectly alright’; Raoof Hasan claims no lab in Pakistan can detect slow poisoning

Mr Yousuf added that the former first lady had health-related issues for almost two months, and she was “perfectly alright” when the team visited her.
“She herself said she was all right, and there was no evidence that she was poisoned,” he said.
While replying to a question, the doctor said no samples were collected to identify the slow poisoning. “Only blood samples were collected, and Gas­troscopy was suggested.”
Other team members of the medical team included Dr Ayesha Javed from Pims’ Department of Gen­e­ral Medicine, Dr Ayesha Afzal from the Depart­ment of Ophthal­mology, Dr Am­­m­­ara Aslam from the Dep­a­rtment of ENT and Dr Maria Baloch from the Dep­artment of Gastroenterology.
The report
According to the medical report, seen by Dawn, Ms Bibi, 51, had “no previous co-morbid illnesses” when she was tested on Thursday.
“According to the patient, she took some food two and half months ago that caused burning sensation in the epigastrium, swelling of lips, watering of eyes and dryness of skin. This continued for a few hours and then improved.”
Over the next few days, the former first lady complained of “experiencing a bad taste in the mouth” with occasional pain in the abdomen and early satiety.
However, she didn’t experience any odynophagia — pain while swallowing — or dysphagia — a medical term for swallowing difficulties.
The report added that Ms Bibi did lose some weight during the initial weeks of her incarceration, but the weight has now been regained.
“Currently, [the] patient complains of bad taste in mouth and occasional mild lower abdominal discomfort. She also complains of occasional ear blockage but no other ear or nasal symptoms,” it stated.
The report added that Ms Bibi’s medical history and physical examination showed “no such signs or symptoms” that would raise any concerns.
While talking to Dawn, a senior official of the health ministry said that the medical team collected samples in compliance with court orders.
The official, who wished not to be named, said since it was a high-profile issue, the ministry would “prefer to stay away” from the matter.
“[Other] government officials such as the information minister may ann­ounce more details about the issues and reports.”
Recriminations
Punjab Information Minister Azma Zahid Bokhari said four doctors of Pims collected Ms Bibi’s samples, and there were no symptoms of poisoning.
“Unfortunately, both husband and wife are habitual liars,” she added.
Meanwhile, PTI’s Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan said that there was not a single laboratory in the country that could detect slow poisoning.
While talking to Dawn, Mr Hasan also criticised the Punjab information minister’s statement, saying she was unaware that lab samples needed to be sent to Germany or Canada to confirm slow poisoning.
Meanwhile, PTI leader and former Punjab chief minister Parvez Elahi, who is also admitted in Pims, underwent a number of tests on Thursday.

LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday underlined the need for introducing judicial reforms in the country in line with the Charter of Democracy, which was reached between the late Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif decades ago.
Ninety per cent of the points mentioned in the charter of democracy have been implemented, he claimed, adding that now is the time to go for judicial reforms so that people could get justice.
People of Pakistan face certain difficulties in getting justice, Mr Bhutto-Zardari told a gathering of polling agents and in-charges of the election campaign for the Sindh Assembly’s constituency PS-10. The meeting was held at the camp office of presidency in Naudero, marking the death anniversary of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
The PPP leader said that after the Supreme Court’s recent short order in the Z.A. Bhutto case time has come to introduce judicial reforms in the country. He appealed to the federal government to carry out judicial reforms to ensure speedy justice to people.

He noted that the judgement in the Z.A. Bhutto reference filed by President Asif Ali Zardari came after a long struggle.
He stated that due to the holy month of Ramazan the death anniversary of Z.A. Bhutto would now be held on April 13 or 14, adding that the party would make a final decision in this regard. He said the future event would be a historic one since it would be held in the wake of the Supreme Court’s short order in the Bhutto case.
The PPP leader pointed out that during the election campaign he had stated that no party would be able to form its government without the PPP’s support, adding that his prediction stands proved today.
“We took part in elections, but could not secure a simple majority to form our government. Therefore, we decided to lend support to the federal government with the sole objective of addressing the issues of poverty, economic crisis, price hike and unemployment,” he said. The federal government should be given time to deliver and pull the people out of the economic crisis, he added.
About PPP’s governments in Sindh and Balochistan, he said those who won the elections should now be ready to make efforts to find out solution to people’s problems.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari asked Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to call upon ministers to hold open kutcheris in different districts to have first-hand knowledge of the issues and prepare development plans in consultation with the area people. He said funds for the execution of development schemes would be released to provide relief to people.
Talking about the ‘Awami Muashi Muahida’, which was launched during the PPP’s election campaign, he said efforts would be made to implement in letter and spirit its contents by the PPP-led governments in Sindh and Balochistan. “We are trying to extend relief to people in their energy bills through solar energy systems and would also provide relief to farmers through the Kissan Card,” he added.
The PPP chairman said that the energy minister had assured him of providing relief to the masses through the solar system, adding that process had already started to launch the Benazir Mazdoor Card.

2,Zardari assures China of security for its nationals,Russian envoy tells president Moscow wants to double bilateral trade volume,"ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday assured China that foolproof security will be provided to all Chinese nationals working on different projects in Pakistan.
The president gave the assurance to Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong during a meeting at the Aiwan-i-Sadr, according to a statement issued by the Presidency.
“Pakistan will take necessary measures to ensure the security of Chinese nationals working on different projects in the country,” the president said.
The meeting between the president and the Chinese envoy comes more than a week after five Chinese engineers and their Pakistani driver were killed in a suicide attack in Bisham area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Russian envoy tells president Moscow wants to double bilateral trade volume

The attack prompted China to demand a thorough probe into the deadly attack and security for its citizens.
In response, Islamabad had announced a swift probe to hold the perpetrators and accomplices of the attack to account. Chinese investigators had also arrived to join the probe.
In response to the Chinese government’s demand to promptly investigate the incident and act against those involved, the government had also decided to form a joint investigation team to investigate the matter.
The statement said President Zardari and Ambassador Zaidong discussed matters of mutual interest, besides underscoring the need to increase counter-terrorism cooperation and intelligence sharing to overcome the menace of terrorism.
“The president assured the ambassador that Pakistan would take all necessary measures to ensure security of our Chinese brothers, who are working on different projects in Pakistan,” it added.
The Bisham attack was part of a series of assaults in a span of a few days specifically targeting Chinese interests, including recent attacks at the Gwadar Port Authority Complex and the Naval base in Turbat.
These consecutive attacks underlined the escalating security challenges facing Chinese projects and personnel in Pakistan.
In a previous attack in July 2021, 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals, were killed when a coach carrying them to an under-construction tunnel site of the 4,300-megawatt Dasu hydropower project fell into a ravine in the Upper Kohistan area after an explosion.
Russian ambassador meets president
President Zardari also had a meeting with Russian Ambassador Albert P. Khorev and extended his condolences for several deaths in a terrorist attack last month in Moscow.
Mr Khorev told Mr Zardari that Russia desired to play its part in the economic development Pakistan and that both countries were cooperating on mutual issues such as anti-terrorism and drug trafficking.
The ambassador said that Russia desired to double the existing volume of bilateral trade with Pakistan and President Zardari also expressed the hope to increase bilateral trade, particularly in energy and barter trade.

3,39 PTI activists get bail in Lahore corps commander house attack case,Lawyers say police have failed to produce any evidence establishing charges against the petitioners.,"LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court on Thursday granted post-arrest bail to 39 activists of the PTI in a case of attacking Lahore corps commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House, during May 9 riots.
Judge Arshad Javed allowed the bail petitions of the jailed activists subject to furnishing of surety bonds of Rs100, 000.
Those granted bail include Shan Ali, Nadir Mahmood, Awais Ali, Yar Gul, Waqar Jamil, Zeeshan Butt, Kashif Khan, Awn Abbas, Naqeeb Ahmad, Riaz Ahmad and Tasawur Hussain.
Lawyers for the activists mainly argued that they had not committed any illegal act.
They said the police have failed to produce any evidence establishing charges against the petitioners. They said the investigation rather showed the petitioners were peaceful participants of a political march.
The counsel said the police levelled general accusations against the petitioners without attributing any specific role to them.
They further argued that the petitioners were not nominated in the FIR and police implicated them at a later stage without conducting identification parade of the suspects.
They pointed out that many suspects having similar roles had already been released on bail and, therefore, the rule of consistency was applicable to these petitioners also.
Sarwar Road police had registered FIR No 96 against PTI leaders and workers on charges of attacking and vandalising the Jinnah House during the May 9 violent protests which had erupted after the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan in a graft case by NAB from the Islamabad High Court.
Over the last two months, over 200 male and female activists of PTI have been granted bail in the Jinnah House attack by different trial courts.
Besides terrorism charges under Section 7 of the Anti-Tterrorism Act, 1997, various offences were added to the FIR.

4,IHC orders removal of Mazari’s name from ECL,"Separately, PTI leader Azam Khan Swati was granted pre-arrest interim bail in a case related to controversial tweets against state institutions.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Thursday directed the interior ministry to remove the name of former federal minister Dr Shireen Mazari from the Exit Control List (ECL).
Ms Mazari’s name was placed on the ECL because she was among those members of the PTI-led federal cabinet that had approved the confidential agreement that allowed transfer of GBP190 million to real estate tycoon Malik Riaz.
Mr Riaz allegedly laundered this money to the UK for the purchase of a house, but the amount was detected by the National Crimes Agency (NCA) and it was later sent back to Pakistan.
Special Prosecutor of the National Accounta­bility Bureau (NAB) informed the IHC that Ms Mazari was not required on the no-fly list as she was not among the accused persons.
The assistant attorney general told the court that a letter had been written to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on March 27 in this regard.
After hearing the arguments, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz ordered the ministry to remove Ms Mazari’s name from the ECL.
Azam Swati gets interim bail
A special judge central granted pre-arrest interim bail to PTI leader Azam Khan Swati in a case related to controversial tweets against state institutions.
Mr Swati was an absconder in the case. He appeared before the court along with his lawyer Ali Bukhari. The court granted Mr Swati interim bail till April 20.
The Anti-Terrorism Court of Islamabad also granted bail to Mr Swati in a case registered against him in connection with violent protest outside the Fed­eral Courts Complex in March last year.

5,Balochistan still awaits formation of cabinet,Sources say PPP and PML-N would be the main shareholders while other parties would also get some share in the cabinet.,"QUETTA: Even though all other provinces have their new administrations in place, the Balochistan cabinet has yet to be for­m­ed, despite the election of PPP’s Mir Sarfraz Ahmed Bugti as the leader of house almost a month ago.
Mr Bugti, who took oath as the chief minister on March 2, had hinted that the cabinet would be in place after the Senate elections and ministers sworn in on April 4.
The process of Senate elections has been completed and all 11 senators from Balochistan have been elected unopposed.
It was being expected that coalition partners will choose the cabinet with consensus the same way as they lent support to the candidates for Senate.
CM Bugti and leaders of other coalition parties held several meetings to finalise the names of ministers and advisors. The CM also called on PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari to seek his approval for the party’s candidates for ministries.
As a result of these deliberations, sources claimed, things had almost been finalised among coalition partners and the cabinet was scheduled to take oath on April 4, but Mr Bugti had to suddenly fly abroad because of the illness of his elder brother.
The newly appointed spokesman for the Baloc­histan government, Sha­hid Rind confirmed on Thursday that matters regarding cabinet formation have been settled between the coalition parties, but the annou­ncement was delayed due to the chief minister’s trip.
The process will be completed after the CM’s return, he said Mr Rind also claimed that one more party might join the coalition, currently comprising PPP, PML-N, Balochistan Awami Party and Awami National Party.
Sources have said that as per the power-sharing formula, PPP and PML-N would be the main shareholders while other parties would also get some share in the cabinet.
“Now, the parties will choose MPAs for the posts of ministers and advisors,” a senior PPP leader told Dawn.
However, PML-N suffered a setback as it lost slot of the speaker when retired captain Abdul Khaliq Achakzai was deseated after ECP cancelled the notification of his victory from PB-51 Chaman.
Accepting petitions of his three rivals, Muhammad Asghar Achakzai of ANP, Abaseen Achakzai of PkMAP and Muhammad Nawaz of JUI-F, the ECP has ordered re-polling in 12 polling stations.
The result of 12 polling stations was cancelled after the ECP observed an unusual pattern of voting.

6,Hafiz Naeem becomes the new face of Jamaat-i-Islami,"Defeats veterans Sirajul Haq, Liaqat Baloch; will lead party until April 2029","

Hafiz Naeemur Rehman

 
LAHORE / KARACHI: Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, known for his populist approach and vocal leadership in Karachi, has been elected the sixth emir of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), defeating established figures like Sirajul Haq and Liaqat Baloch and setting a new course for the party.
Rashid Naseem, the head of the JI election commission, announced the decision at a press conference at the party’s headquarters in Mansoora.
Mr Naseem told the media that most party members had cast their votes in favour of Hafiz Naeem to lead the party. However, as per party policy, he didn’t disclose the number of votes earned by each candidate.
Hafiz Naeem, a professional engineer, currently serves as the emir of the JI Karachi chapter. He is set to lead the party until April 8, 2029.

Defeats veterans Sirajul Haq, Liaqat Baloch; will lead party until April 2029

Before his entry into national politics, he was actively involved in student politics and held the position of elected nazim-i-aala (president) of the Islami Jamiat-i-Talaba (IJT).
Mr Naseem revealed that over 82 per cent of the JI members participated in the election. JI has over 45,000 members, including around 6,000 women, who form the electoral college for the emir’s election.
The JI’s election commission, an elected body itself, was responsible for overseeing the election process.
Mr Naseem, the JI election commission head, said the election was conducted through secret balloting. The process began on Feb 19, with the printing and distribution of ballot papers among the members, and concluded on March 25. He said the election process was smooth and peaceful and ended on April 3.
The party’s 100-member shura, or governing body, had proposed three names for the consideration of the JI members: the outgoing Emir Sirajul Haq, Vice Emir Liaqat Baloch, and Hafiz Naeem. However, members were also free to suggest any other name as well.
Hafiz Naeem is the sixth person to occupy the top party post, following Maulana Abul A’la Maududi (1941-72), Mian Tufail Muhammad (1972-87), Qazi Hussain Ahmed (1987-2008), Munawer Hassan (2008-2013) and Sirajul Haq (2013-2024).
With Hafiz Naeem elected as the new emir, political pundits see the breaking of many trends in Jamaat’s set patterns of political behaviour. They see it as a sign of populism creeping into the Jamaat as the newly-minted emir has been able to capture the attention of the media and the public far more than both his rivals in recent days.
He has been the most prominent voice of his party, leaving far behind both his rivals Sirajul Haq and an old guard Liaqat Baloch and appealing directly to the voters, which seems to have paid off.
“Jamaat, a religious and conventional party, normally avoids tradition-breaking leaders,” a party insider said.
Who is Hafiz Naeem?
The 52-year-old graduate of NED University of Engineering and Technology, Hafiz Naeem has risen to the top slot of the party, which was founded over 82 years ago in Lahore, before Partition.
Hafiz Naeem, who was born in Hyderabad and moved to Karachi after matriculation, turned out to be an active political activist from his teenage years and became the IJT chief in 1998.
He entered mainstream politics in 2000 when he formally joined the Jamaat after years of student activism. He then climbed through the ranks to become the emir of JI’s Karachi chapter in 2013.
During his decade-old leadership of the party in Karachi, Hafiz Naeem became a strong voice not only of the JI but was also often seen as the leading campaigner for the city and its rights.
From campaigning against inflated power bills and excessive power outages in Karachi to the movement against the real-estate giant Bahria Town demanding justice and “true utilisation” of Karachiites’ hard-earned money, Hafiz Naeem became a household name of Karachi politics.
His growing popularity helped the JI stage a strong comeback in electoral politics, first in the Cantonment Board elections in September 2021 and then in the local bodies election in January 2023.
Though the party failed to create any impact in National Assembly constituencies of Karachi in the Feb 8 general elections, it claimed to have won over half a dozen seats of the Sindh Assembly which it said were stolen and given away to rival parties through alleged vote rigging.
