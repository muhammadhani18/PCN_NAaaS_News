Earlier today, Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Justice Ali Baqar Najafi became the latest target on Friday of the suspicious ‘toxic letters’ received by superior members of the judiciary over the last few days.
The total number of LHC judges receiving the letter reached six. The letter received by Justice Najafi was said to have been handed over to the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD).
Two days ago, eight judges, including Chief Justice Aamer Farooq of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) received letters containing an unknown powder, suspected to be laced with anthrax.
A day later, the letters containing the suspicious powdery toxic substance were sent to the Supreme Court jurists, including Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, as well as other judges of the LHC.

1,"Biden's ultimatum to Netanyahu: protect Gaza civilians, or else","If we don't see the changes that we need to see, there will be changes in our policy: Blinken","US President Joe Biden effectively gave Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an ultimatum on Thursday: protect Palestinian civilians and foreign aid workers in Gaza or Washington could rein in support for Israel in its war against Palestinian resistance group Hamas.
The message, after months of US calls for Israel to change its military tactics that have killed tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians, followed an Israeli attack that killed seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers and triggered global outrage.
Israel claims the strike - which targeted the WCK convoy thrice - was a mistake.
The White House did not say exactly what steps it wanted Netanyahu to take, nor what it would do if he failed to take them. But analysts said the implicit threat was to slow US arms transfers to Israel or to temper US support at the UN.
""This is as close to a 'come to Jesus' moment as you can get,"" said analyst Steven Cook of the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, referring to Biden's comment last month that he and Netanyahu were heading for such a turning point.
Dennis Ross, a veteran US diplomat now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said, ""The president, in effect, is saying meet these humanitarian needs or I will have no choice but to condition (military) assistance.""
Biden, up for re-election in November, has struggled to balance pressure to rein in Netanyahu from progressive democrats dismayed at the Palestinian civilian death toll against the risk that may alienate mostly pro-Israel independent voters. He has so far resisted setting conditions on arms transfers.
The war on Gaza has laid waste to much of the densely populated territory and displaced most of its 2.3 million people.
More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the health ministry in Gaza, of which most were women and children.
Describing their call, the White House said Biden called for Israel ""to announce and implement a series of specific, concrete, and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers"".
""He made clear that US policy concerning Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel's immediate action on these steps,"" the White House added in a statement.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was more blunt.
""Look, I'll just say this, if we don't see the changes that we need to see, there will be changes in our policy.""
On Thursday evening, just hours after the call, the Israeli government announced several steps to increase aid flows to Gaza, including opening the Ashdod port and the Erez crossing into northern Gaza and increasing aid deliveries from Jordan. It was not clear if the steps would be enough to satisfy US demands.
Turning point
The turning point for Biden, an ardent supporter of Israel, was Monday's deadly Israeli attack on the workers from celebrity chef Jose Andres' WCK charity group.
It came as the Biden administration has been stepping up pressure on Israel to consider alternatives to a threatened ground offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a source familiar with the talks said the 30-minute call was at times tense, with Biden spelling out his concerns and Netanyahu defending his approach on Gaza.
A senior White House official described the conversation as ""very direct, very straightforward,"" saying it included Vice President Kamala Harris, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Blinken.
As to what the United States expects, the official said, ""We need a comprehensive plan on them doing a much better job here. They can’t be killing humanitarian aid workers and civilians.""
While Biden has long avoided curtailing US support for Israel, he may finally have reached his limit.
""There was always going to be a point at which the Biden administration felt that the domestic and international cost of supporting Israel's campaign in Gaza outweighed the benefit of what Israel was able to achieve on the ground,"" said Mike Singh, a former National Security Council official on the Middle East.
""What is remarkable is not that this is happening but that it took so long.""
Singh, now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said if Israel did not meet Biden's conditions, the likeliest step was the US negotiating a UN Security Council resolution like the one that ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict.
""Placing conditions on arms transfers is more fraught politically, would likely face stiff opposition on (Capitol) Hill, and could leave Israel vulnerable to attack by Hezbollah or other Iranian proxies,"" he added.
Still, Biden may have telegraphed his thinking last month when, after saying a Rafah invasion would be a ""red line,"" he said he would never cut off ""all weapons so that they don’t have the Iron Dome (missile defense system) to protect them.""
He did not explicitly make such assurances about offensive weapons, fueling speculation he could impose conditions on such arms transfers to Israel, which relies heavily on US arms.
Jonathan Panikoff, a former deputy national intelligence officer on the Middle East, said Biden was unlikely to take drastic action upending US-Israeli ties, such as withholding big-ticket weapons or completely abandoning Israel at the UN.
But he could put conditions on smaller military items and take further measures against extremist Jewish settlers involved in attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
""Biden's frustration with how the war is being conducted, and with Prime Minister Netanyahu himself, has reached an apex,"" Panikoff said.

3,PML-N stays aloof from internal rift,Party fears acknowledging 'gibberish' would invite unnecessary media attention,"Despite sharp jabs from its own ranks, the PML-N appears determined to strategically play the proverbial ostrich, burying its head in the sand while hoping that the criticism will not garner traction on its own.
Despite senior party figures openly lambasting the central government, PML-N appears unfazed as sources within the PM House reveal that acknowledging such criticism would only draw unnecessary media attention towards such “gibberish”.
From former interior minister Rana Sanaullah to portfolio-less federal minister Javed Latif, Senator Javed Abbasi and former senator Asif Saeed Kirmani, a slew of party stalwarts have taken potshots at the leadership.
Their remarks, questioning cabinet formation, casting doubt on the legitimacy of general elections, and expressing disillusionment with the party cosying up to the establishment and abandoning the ‘vote ko izzat do’ slogan.
The airing of public grievances has significantly damaged the party's reputation as a champion of democracy..
Interestingly, all four critics share a common thread: two of them, Sanaullah and Javed, faced defeat in elections, while the others failed to secure party support for re-election, leaving them out of any legislative assembly.
‘Sour grapes’
A well-placed source within the PM House said that Javed Latif and Rana Sanaullah's statements against the government stem from sour grapes. Both of them got a taste of defeat in the recent elections, and no amount of criticism will change that fact.
In fact, Rana Sanaullah, who is also the party’s central Punjab president, not only bit the dust in his own electoral run but also saw his party's ship sink city-wide to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), laying bare his feeble grip on the party's internal affairs.
He said that engaging in the charade that there was some conspiracy against him or that the cabinet formation had input from the establishment only exposes his shallow-minded approach.
When questioned about the party's stance on taking action against such leaders, he clarified that while Sanaullah's remarks were distasteful, they didn't breach party protocol, unlike Javed Latif's extensive transgressions.
Despite their scathing criticism of the government, it was deemed prudent to overlook their statements as serving them with a show cause notice would only amplify the attention towards their allegations, rendering any action counterproductive.
When asked if these pros and cons were taken into account by the PM or his cabinet, he without specifying confirmed that the matter had been discussed.
Another source within the federal cabinet concurred with the said opinion, saying that issuing a show-cause notice would only divert public attention towards their remarks. He suggested that their meaningless chatter should be disregarded for the time being.
The party's priority lies in fulfilling its election promises, and it's imperative to maintain focus on that agenda, he added.
Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, speaking to The Express Tribune, emphasised the federal government's unwavering focus on the economy, growth, and various pressing issues facing the nation and its citizens.
When asked about the aforementioned statements, he asserted that the government has no time to dedicate to non-issues.

5,IHC removes Mazari’s name from ECL,NAB had previously recommended removing her name from the ECL in March,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has ordered the removal of former human rights minister Dr Shireen Mazari's name from the Exit Control List (ECL) based on statements by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor and the assistant attorney general.
The decision came during a hearing of a petition filed by Mazari, who personally appeared before the court. NAB prosecutor Rafay Maqsood informed the court that Mazari was not implicated in the £190 million case, and NAB had previously recommended removing her name from the ECL in March.
Additionally, the assistant attorney general said they had notified the Prime Minister's Office on March 27 to remove Mazari's name from the ECL, leaving the decision to the federal cabinet.
Justice Imtiaz noted the heavy workload of the federal cabinet and expressed the court's willingness to assist. Consequently, the bench instructed authorities to permit Mazari to travel abroad.

6,Bilawal demands judicial reforms,PPP chief says party backs PML-N for continuity of democracy,"Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said on Thursday that time had come for introducing judicial reforms in the country following the Supreme Court’s opinion that the conviction of party founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in the late 1970s was the result of mistrial.
Addressing party workers and supporters at an Iftar in Larkana district on the occasion of 45th death anniversary of the late Bhutto, Bilawal announced that the PPP would ask the federal government to undertake such reforms.
In response to a presidential reference filled more than a decade ago, the Supreme Court on March 6 observed that the trial in the murder case against former prime minister Bhutto did not meet the requirements of a “fair trial and due process”.
“It is time to initiate judicial reforms. The PPP will ask the federal government to undertake these reforms,” the PPP chairman told the gathering. “We want to provide speedy justice to the people. We want to fulfil our promise,” he added.
The PPP chairman recalled that his mother and former prime minister late Benazir Bhutto had made the judicial reforms an integral part of the Charter of Democracy (CoD), which was signed with Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif in May 2006.
In collaboration with the PML-N, Bilawal claimed, 90% of the CoD had been implemented, including the restoration of the 1973 Constitution in its original form and giving rights to the provinces. “Any work that is left undone, so far, is the part pertaining to the judicial reforms,” he said.
He pointed out that the apex court had acknowledged that a “historic crime occurred” in the conviction and hanging his grandfather. “I think [Bhutto’s conviction] is a big stain on our judiciary and on its history, which we need to ‘correct’ for which we will have to step forward to [start] judicial reforms.”
The PPP chairman suggested that his party, which is an ally of the PML-N government at the Centre, would take measures in parliament to fulfil the promise of reforms made in the CoD.
“We should bring changes in the Constitution and in the law… so that we can provide justice to the people of Pakistan.”
Bilawal told the gathering that the April 4 public meeting on Bhutto’s death anniversary had been postponed because of Ramazan, adding that a historic public meeting would be held on April 14 at the mausoleum of the Bhuttos in Garhi Khuda Bukhsh.
Speaking about the general elections, Bilawal said that the PPP was not given a clear majority; therefore, the party preferred to support the PML-N to form the federal government. He reiterated that continuity of democracy and prevailing economic hardships in the country motivated them to take that decision.
He said that he had asked Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and his cabinet ministers to hold public meetings in all the districts of Sindh to take the people’s input regarding the provincial budget for the fiscal 2024-25.

7,Balochistan cabinet formation in limbo,Delay in assigning of portfolios results in a growing uneasiness in the ruling coalition,"Despite Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti's assurances to the media, the much-anticipated formation of the Balochistan cabinet, slated for April 4, is still pending, leaving the coalition parties in suspense.
While provincial cabinets have been established in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh, Balochistan has yet to follow suit, even after more than a month since election.
Assurances were given that portfolio distribution among lawmakers would commence after the Senate voting on April 2. However, this commitment remains unfulfilled, further escalating the already tense political climate in the province.
In a bid to prevent horse-trading and vote-selling, coalition partners, along with opposition factions, collaborated to ensure the uncontested victory of Balochistan's senators. Their efforts yielded results, with 11 senators elected unopposed, showcasing a rare unity among political adversaries.
The delay in the oath-taking ceremony of provincial ministers has been attributed to the death anniversary of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the founder of the ruling PPP and former prime minister of Pakistan.
CM Bugti's absence, reportedly due to his brother's medical treatment in Dubai, has been cited as a contributing factor to the delay, further complicating the situation.
While there has been no official confirmation from the chief minister or the government spokesman in Balochistan, insiders suggest that the cabinet formation process is facing significant hurdles due to constraints outlined in the 18th amendment.
This amendment limits the province to accommodate only 14 provincial ministers and 5 advisers. With the number of the PPP, PML-N lawmakers, and their allies exceeding 40, allocating positions becomes a daunting task, ripe with potential for intra-party conflicts and discontent.
As the political landscape in Balochistan remains uncertain, stakeholders await further developments regarding the formation of the provincial cabinet, hoping for resolution amidst mounting pressures and expectations.
Cracks are likely to emerge after the distribution of portfolios among the members of the treasury benches, with potential resistance from the losers against the chief minister.

8,Country should chalk out pension reform plan: WB,Global lender asks Pakistan to revamp personal income tax system,"The World Bank has stressed the need for Pakistan to introduce immediate parametric reforms to reduce the fiscal liability arising from federal and provincial public sector pensions.
In its recent Pakistan Development Update report, the WB has recommended that the country should develop and take initial steps to implement a longer-term pension reform plan to ensure sustained fiscal affordability.
“[Pakistan should] take initial steps under a reform plan to rationalise public sector compensation, including through simplification and monetisation of benefits,” it added.
The global lender also suggested that Pakistan should continue its electricity and gas sector tariff reforms to align them with the cost of supply to constrain mounting energy sector circular debt.
In term of the rising electricity and gas sector tariffs, it called for aiding the poor through enhanced social protection.
The WB also pushed the country to revamp its personal income tax system to reduce complexity by aligning schemes for salaried and non-salaried workers.
It further called for reforming personal income tax schedules to “increase equity by eliminating privileged treatment of specific income sources and by harmonising rate structures across taxable income sources”.
The global lender suggested that the country should increase taxes on socially harmful goods, including increased taxation of tobacco, other unhealthy products, and environmentally damaging goods.
It added that Pakistan should eliminate personal income tax withholding charges on consumption of energy products, telecommunications, financial services, and others to reduce the burden on poor and vulnerable households.
The WB also further urged Pakistan to reduce average tariffs and do away with the anti-export bias of the existing trade policy.
It continued that to achieve this goal, the country could develop, publicise, and begin implementing a tariff rationalisation strategy.
“Phase out import duty exemptions under the 5th schedule of the tariff code to level the playing field and reduce tax expenditures.”
The WB called for opening export financing schemes to firms in all sectors, focusing on new cones or those exporting new products or to new markets and gradually link interest rates with those of the market to increase cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability.
""Simplify requirements and documentation for firms to access the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS). Digitise and automate EFS processes and verification checks through the Pakistan Single Window to allow risk-based audits"" it added.

9,Provinces to get devolved ministries,PM wants tax-to-GDP ratio at 15% in next five years,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday directed that a comprehensive plan for increase in revenue should be prepared without putting burden on the common man.
While chairing a meeting on the Ministry of Finance, he said in the next five years the tax-to-GDP ratio would be taken to 15 per cent.
He said the federal government would strengthen the provinces and would hand over all the relevant ministries and departments to the provinces under the 18th amendment, adding expenditure would be reduced to decrease fiscal deficit.
He directed to speed up the process of reforms and privatisation of the state-owned institutions, especially those which were running in losses.
He said the public-private partnership should be initiated with private operators to improve the services at all the large airports of the country.
The prime minister said the government was fully focused on gradually decreasing the public debt, pension and subsidy reforms and reforms and privatisation of the state-owned entities.
He said the conclusion of the standby programme with the International Monetary Fund was a positive development, adding the government would make full effort for the next programme with the IMF.
He said a detailed plan should also be presented for decrease in external debt. The services of international experts should be hired for achieving economic progress, he added.
The meeting was briefed about revenue, taxes, fiscal deficit, foreign exchange reserves, remittances and current account.
The participants of the meeting were also informed about the progress on the implementation on issues of revenue, subsidies, power sector reforms and on the instructions of the prime minister to reduce government expenditure.
Federal ministers Muhammad Aurangzeb, Ahad Khan Cheema, Dr Musadiq Malik, Ahsan Iqbal, Deputy Chairman Planning Commission Jehanzeb Khan, Coordinator of Prime Minister Rana Ihsaan Afzal and relevant officers attended the meeting.
