0,Two-time champion ineligible for Olympic qualifiers,LAUSANNE: Russia’s two-time Olympic champion Abdulrashid Sadulaev will not be allowed to compete in the European ...,"LAUSANNE: Russia’s two-time Olympic champion Abdulrashid Sadulaev will not be allowed to compete in the European OG Qualifiers in Baku after United World Wrestling (UWW) on Thursday found new information about his support of the Ukraine-Russia war.
The sport’s governing body said that the 27-year-old, who won gold at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro and at Tokyo 2020, failed to meet the eligibility criteria set by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for Individual Neutral Athletes.
Relations between Russia and the IOC have worsened in the run-up to the Paris Olympics, starting on July 26 where Russian and Belarusian athletes will compete as neutrals, without their flags and anthems, and be excluded from the opening parade, because of the war in Ukraine.
“Sadulaev was declared ineligible after the panel found new information about his support of the Ukraine-Russia war...,” UWW said in a statement.
“The decisions regarding eligibility were made by a panel, relying on comprehensive vetting reports provided by an independent and private intelligence service provider.”
Alikhan Zhabrailov will replace Sadulaev for the event in Baku, the third continental Olympic qualifiers which will be held from April 5-7 with 36 quotas on offer.
“I want to emphasise that it was the IOC that made the decision on Sadulaev’s ineligibility, the UWW on the contrary did everything possible to make Sadulaev wrestle,” president of the Russian Wrestling Federation Mikhail Mami­ashvili said.
“At the moment, all Russian wrestlers have a clear task - to get tickets to the Olympic Games on a sporting principle. And after that we will weigh the pros and cons and decide whether to go to Paris.”

1,Flawless Leverkusen cruise past Dusseldorf into German Cup final,LEVERKUSEN: Bunde­sliga leaders Bayer Lever­kusen overwhelmed second division club Fortuna Duss­eldorf 4-0 on...,"LEVERKUSEN: Bunde­sliga leaders Bayer Lever­kusen overwhelmed second division club Fortuna Duss­eldorf 4-0 on Wednesday to reach the German Cup final and stretch their unbeaten run to 40 matches across all competitions this season. 
First-half goals from Jeremie Frimpong, Amine Adli and Florian Wirtz put the game to bed as Dusseldorf struggled to cope with the hosts’ pace. 
Germany international Wirtz added a fourth with a penalty on the hour to give Xabi Alonso’s team another shot at winning a major trophy for the first time in 31 years. 
Leverkusen will face Kaiserslautern, who ousted third division Saarbrucken 2-0 on Tuesday, in the final on May 25. 
“It is very important for the last game of the season to be a final,” Alonso, who is staying at Leverkusen despite interest from major European clubs. “We now have a super chance and we are happy. 
“It has been a long road. We started back in July with new players. But they have done it well. We show it on the pitch and that is important. We now have to enjoy the moment that we have earned the chance to be in the final.” 
Leverkusen can clinch the Bundesliga title for the first time earlier than that, however, with a 13-point lead over second-placed Bayern Munich and seven games remaining. They are also through to the Europa League last eight where they face West Ham United. 
Duesseldorf’s hopes of joining Kaiserslautern in the first-ever all second-division final took an early hit, Frimpong slamming in from close range after seven minutes. 
Wirtz, again pulling the strings for Leverkusen despite being just 20, found Adli who blasted home confidently to double the lead. 
Leverkusen scored a third after winning the ball back and working it quickly to Wirtz, who shed a defender and finished past Florian Kastenmeier. 
After 60 minutes, Patrik Schick’s header connected with the hand of Duesseldorf’s Matthias Zimmerman, with the referee pointing to the spot after a VAR review. 
Kastenmeier guessed correctly but Wirtz’s shot was per­f­ectly tucked inside the left post, and the home fans broke out into chants of “Ber­lin, we’re going to Berlin” for May’s cup final.

PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that he had no doubt Russia would malevolently target the Paris Olympics this summer, in comments that underline the fraught geopolitical backdrop to the Games.
“I have no doubt whatsoever, including in terms of information,” Macron said in response to a reporter’s question about whether he thought that Russia would try to target the Olympics.
The Russian embassy in Paris did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Macron’s remarks, delivered at an event in Paris for the inauguration of the new Olympics aquatic centre, represent his most explicit acknowledgment to date of foreign threats to the security or smooth running of the games.
The globally anticipated event takes place amid a complex global context, with Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israel’s conflict with Hamas in Gaza complicating efforts to safeguard the Olympics.
A Macron aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to say whether the president was referring to specific intelligence signalling a future Russian interference attempt.
Instead, she said:  “There is a hardening from Russia, which we have been seeing for several months.”
Macron has recently adopted a tougher stance against Russia, vowing that Moscow must be defeated, and has not ruled out that European troops may one day go to Ukraine, although he has made clear that France has no intention of instigating hostilities against Russia.
His government has also adopted a tougher line against alleged Russian disinformation efforts across Europe.
Earlier this week, Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said France will propose EU-wide level sanctions on those behind spreading disinformation amid what Paris sees as growing efforts by Russia to destabilise the bloc.
Relations between Russia and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have worsened in the run-up to the Paris Olympics, where Russian and Belarusian athletes will compete as neutrals, without their flags and anthems, and be excluded from the opening parade.
They were initially banned from competing internationally following Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Russia said last year it planned to relaunch a multi-sport ‘Friendship Games’ in 2024, 40 years after its first edition, a move the IOC has criticised as a  “political action”.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this week that the IOC’s attitude to Russia’s plans to host international sports events was  “unacceptable” and the IOC was damaging the Olympic movement by refusing to dissociate itself from politics.
In other comments, Macron backed the idea of Franco-Malian singer Aya Nakamura performing at the opening ceremony of the Games and urged his compatriots to have  “confidence” ahead of the Games.
Nakamura has been at the centre of a political storm since March when it emerged in media reports Macron had suggested the superstar singer of  “Djadja” could perform at the opening ceremony on July 26.
Influential far-right politicians and other conservatives have rounded on the 28-year-old, accusing her of  “vulgarity” and not respecting the French language, while racist online abuse has sparked a police investigation.
“I think she is certainly suitable for the opening or closing ceremony of the Games,” Macron told reporters in his first comments on the controversy.
“If she’s part of the ceremony with other artists, I think it’s a good thing,” he added, saying the  “Games and the ceremonies should resemble us. She is part of French culture and French music.”
The recent row over Nakamura and a spat over the official poster for the Games — in which a Christian cross has been omitted from a Paris landmark — underline the tricky job organisers have in uniting a fractious country behind the Olympics.
An Islamic State-claimed attack last month on a Moscow concert hall, which left at least 144 people dead, has also revived fears extremists might be plotting to target the first Games in the French capital in 100 years.
“We need to have confidence in ourselves,” Macron told reporters, adding:  “Yes, there are risks, but there are risks in life and the best way to avoid risks is to do nothing. I don’t think that’s the mission of the French nation, or ever has been.”
Up to the final second “we will be determined, vigilant and at work. We’ll succeed and it will make the country proud,” he promised.
Concern has centred on the spectacular opening ceremony being planned on the river Seine that will see athletes travel several kilometres on a flotilla of more than a hundred boats -- rather than parade through the athletics stadium, as is customary.
Macron insisted that the open-air extravaganza, with as many as 500,000 spectators watching from the banks and nearby buildings, remained the “favoured scenario” but contingency plans were being worked on.
“Everything is a cause of vigilance and attention, nothing is a cause of worry or paralysis. That is my and our state of mind,” he said.
In further efforts to lift the gloom around the Olympics, Macron urged observers to look at the achievements so far, with all of the sporting infrastructure on track and with a budget that is only slightly higher than expected.
The 188-million-euro ($204-million) aquatics centre he visited on Thursday — one of only two new venues built for the Paris Olympics — was handed over to the local organising committee a month ahead of schedule.
“Take a bit of perspective and look at the history of previous Games,” he said.  “Remember the overspends of four, eight, or 12 years ago. It’s nothing like this.

3,‘PCB chairman furious over mishandling of Ihsanullah injury’,Naqvi believes it was the responsibility of the board officials and medical panel to take good care of the fast bowler.,"LAHORE: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi is furious over the way the board’s officials have handled the injury of young fast bowler Ihsanullah, the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency reported on Thursday.
Ihsanullah, 21, made a big impact in last year’s Pakistan Super League with his pace and subsequently went on to make his debut in three T20 matches against Afghan­istan in Sha­r­jah and two ODIs at home against New Zealand.
But after the New Zealand series, he suffered an elbow injury and was sidelined for remaining events including the Asia Cup and World Cup.
Unfortunately for the youngster, an incorrect diagnosis of his injury and a botched-up surgery in Lahore has meant he is yet to recover completely.
According to a PCB source, the initial diagnosis was done by a senior doctor on the board’s medical panel, due to which time was wasted on trying to rehabilitate him without surgery.
After he had undergone surgery, which was botched up at a private hospital in Lahore, doctors at his PSL franchise Multan Sultan concluded he needed to consult a specialist in the UK for his treatment.
The franchise owner, Ali Tareen, has now got permission from the PCB to send Ihsanullah to London for further consultation but this has upset Naqvi who believes it was the responsibility of the board officials and medical panel to take good care of the fast bowler. 
“Mohsin Naqvi is very upset after this incident came out in the open and he came to know about it. Chances are that some of the officials responsible for supervising Ehsan’s treatment will find themselves out of jobs very soon,” the source said.
Ihsanullah had impre­ssed everyone with his pace against Afghanistan in Sharjah, finishing with six wickets in three matches while going for very few runs.

4,Misbah slams PCB over handling of Pakistan captaincy saga,"“The change of captaincy always affects all the players of the team,"" says Misbah.","LAHORE:  Criticising the Pakistan Cricket Board moves to remove Babar Azam and then Shaheen Shah Afridi as captain, former skipper Misbah-ul-Haq says the manner in which these decisions were taken disturbs the entire set-up of the team.
“[First] the way Babar was removed as captain was wrong, and now Shaheen was replaced [with Babar] in haste. Both are wrong ways which always disturb the players and the entire set-up of the team,” Misbah said while talking to reporters during a gathering in Lahore on Thursday.
“The change of captaincy always affects all the players of the team. Therefore, the PCB should be more careful in making such decisions,” Misbah, who also worked as national team head coach in the past, added.
Interestingly, Misbah was chairman of the Cricket Technical Committee (CTC) of the Zaka Ashraf-headed PCB Interim Management Comm­ittee when Babar resigned as captain of all three formats in November last year following Pakistan’s dismal performance in the Asia Cup and then the 50-over World Cup where the green-shirts failed to qualify for the semi-finals.
Sources say that Zaka did not consult Misbah, the CTC head, while taking major decisions like removing Babar and team director Mickey Arthur, as the PCB chief noting that Misbah was now engaged in cricket commentary.
The day Babar stepped down, Zaka appointed Shaheen as national T20 captain and former Test all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez as team director in haste, as a demanding Test tour to Australia was round the corner. Zaka also made opener Shan Masood Test skipper for the series Down Under where Pakistan suffered a 3-0 clean sweep.
However Mohsin Raza Naqvi, the recently-elected PCB chairman, brought Babar back after the Shaheen-led Pakistan lost a five-match T20 series 4-1 in New Zealand in January year — which removed all the reservations of Zaka about Babar’s role in Saya Corporation, an England-based players’ agent company.
Misbah further said that the PCB should also take the appointment of coaching staff seriously, emphasising “such decisions are of great importance and long-term coaches should be appointed after considering all the aspects”.
Foreign or local coach, Misbah reckoned, did not matter. “[Rather] the first and foremost thing is to select the best coach and that too for a long period,” he said.
According to Misbah, there should be a proper and clear process for judging the abilities of a coach.
“If he has skills and talent to take the team to progress, he should be hired.”
While saying that choosing the coaching team is not an easy job, he hoped that the PCB must have a think-tank to pick the best staff.
Though the PCB advertised for hiring coaching staff recently and the last date for interested candidates to submit the application is April 15, the names of former South African opener Gary Kristen (Test team coach) and ex-Australian fast bowler Jason Gillespie (white-ball coach) had already been decided by the PCB, according to some media reports.
Shan, meanwhile, insisted that whoever leads the national team in any format the common goal for all players remains the same.
“There’s a new set-up that’s come in, a new selection committee, and you always have a plan,” opener Shan said while talking to Wisden Cricket Monthly.
“And they saw a certain plan and we saw through the explanation that they probably want Shaheen to be rested as well. Because we lost [pacer] Naseem Shah last year just before the [50-over] World Cup which proved very costly to Pakistan,” the left-handed opener added.
“I think for us as players we’ve got a common goal of making sure the Pakistan team does well. Whoever is leading it, everyone is behind them and ready to put in a good shift for them.”

6,Nadal withdraws from Monte Carlo  Masters comeback,The record 11-time Monte Carlo winner lost against Carlos Alcaraz in a Las Vegas exhibition in March before pulling out of the Indian Wells Masters.,"BARCELONA: Rafael Nadal withdrew from the upcoming Monte Carlo Masters on Thursday, where the 22-time Grand Slam winner was expected to make his ATP Tour comeback, saying his body is not yet ready for competition. 
The 37-year-old Spaniard, who has said he expects to retire after the 2024 season, returned to competition in Brisbane in January, after almost a year sidelined with a hip flexor injury, but has not played an ATP event since. 
The record 11-time Monte Carlo winner lost against Carlos Alcaraz in a Las Vegas exhibition in March before pulling out of the Indian Wells Masters, where he had first intended to make his comeback. 
“These are very difficult moments for me, sporting wise. Unfortunately I have to tell you that I am not going to be playing in Monte Carlo. My body simply won’t allow me,” Nadal said in a statement on social media. 
“Even if I am working hard and making the maximum effort every day with all the will to play and compete again at tournaments that have been very important for me, the truth is that I can’t play today,” Nadal continued. 
“You have no idea how hard this is for me to not be able to play these events. The only thing I can do is to accept the situation and try to look at the immediate future keeping the excitement and will to play in order to give me a chance for things to get better. 
The Monte Carlo Masters begins on Sunday.

7,Riyadh to host WTA Finals from 2024-26 with record prize money,The WTA said its agreement with the Saudi Tennis Federation will offer record prize money of $15.25 million this year.,"RIYADH: The season-ending WTA Finals will be held in Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh from 2024-26, the women’s tennis body said on Thursday, ending months of speculation and marking the Gulf country’s latest foray into the sport.
Riyadh will host the season finale — which features the top eight singles players and doubles teams — from Nov 2-9 and replaces last year’s hosts Cancun, Mexico.
The WTA said its agreement with the Saudi Tennis Federation will offer record prize money of $15.25 million this year with further increases in 2025 and 2026.
“To have a women’s tournament of this magnitude and profile is a defining moment for tennis in Saudi Arabia. The WTA Finals has the power to inspire far beyond the sport, especially for our young girls and women,” Saudi Sports Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal Al-Saud told Reuters.
Talk that the event could be shifted to Saudi Arabia had intensified after the men’s ATP Tour said last August its Next Gen Finals would be held in Jeddah from 2023 to 2027.
“The WTA selected Riyadh following a comprehensive evaluation process over several months, which has included assessment of multiple bids from different regions and engagement with players,” it said in a statement.
Saudi Arabia landing the elite tournament is the latest sign of its increasing influence on the sport, after Rafa Nadal was named ambassador of its tennis federation with plans also in the pipeline for a training academy.
The men’s ATP tour also signed a multi-year  “strategic partnership” with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is now the official naming partner of the men’s rankings.
Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in sports like football, Formula One and golf in the last few years while critics accuse the kingdom of using its PIF to  “sportswash” its human rights record.
The country denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws.
WTA chief Steve Simon said last year that Saudi Arabia presented  “big issues” as a host for women’s tour events but also acknowledged the progress it had made and continued to engage with players.
“Bringing the WTA Finals to Riyadh is an exciting new opportunity for us and a positive step for the long-term growth of women’s tennis as a global and inclusive sport,” Simon said.
“We’ve been impressed by the commitment shown by the Saudi Tennis Federation to grow the sport at all levels.”
World number one Iga Swiatek and Caroline Wozniacki said at the Australian Open that engagement offered the chance to spark positive change.
There has been pushback from greats Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova saying the WTA’s values were in stark contrast to those of Saudi Arabia and holding the event there would not represent progress but  “significant regression”.
But the country’s ambassador to the US Reema bint Bandar Al-Saud said the criticism represented stereotypical and western-centric views.
Activists maintain that the human rights risks in Saudi Arabia to players, fans and journalists are  “very serious” and have called for due diligence from tennis bodies if any tournament is held there.
Russian Daria Kasatkina, who came out as gay in 2022,  expressed reservations  last year about competing in future WTA tournaments in Saudi Arabia, where homosexuality is illegal.
“The WTA must now make clear how it expects Saudi Arabia to address serious human rights risks for women, LGBT fans and players, journalists and all who might attend the WTA tournament or be affected by it,” Minky Worden, Director of Global Initiatives at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters.
“These human rights risks must be credibly addressed as part of the tournament preparation.”
SHIFTED FROM SHENZHEN
The tournament was looking at a long future in Shenzhen, China, when the WTA held the 2019 edition of the Finals there with a prize pot of $14 million after the Asian city saw off rival bids to secure a 10-year deal.
However, China’s response to the Covid pandemic forced the event to be cancelled the following year and it was shifted to Guadalajara, Mexico in 2021.
It did not return to Shenzhen in 2022 as expected after the WTA suspended its billion-dollar business in China amid concerns over the treatment of former doubles number one Peng Shuai.
The WTA eventually resumed operations in China last year.
Fort Worth, Texas hosted the 2022 tournament, drawing sparse crowds and the WTA was expected to shift it to Saudi Arabia last year before naming Cancun as the venue less than two months from the start.
That edition was criticised by Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka, who said that she felt  “disrespected” by the standard of organisation, prompting Simon to send a letter to players admitting the event was  “not perfect”.

PARIS: Kylian Mbappe’s strike propelled Paris St Germain into the French Cup final with a comfortable 1-0 win over Stade Rennais on Wednesday, taking them one step closer to a 15th trophy. 
A dominant PSG looked set to take the lead early in the game but goalkeeper Steve Mandanda thwarted their attempts and saved a penalty from Mbappe in the 37th minute. 
However, the 25-year-old striker opened the scoring three minutes later, latching on to a pass from Fabian Ruiz for his eighth goal of the tournament as the Parc des Princes erupted. 
PSG will face Olympique Lyonnais in the cup final on May 25 after they beat 3-0 Valenciennes FC on Tuesday. 
Rennes were desperate for an equaliser in the second half to force a penalty shootout but a Martin Terrier effort was the best they could muster, while Mandanda denied PSG a further advantage. 
“It was a difficult first half but we completely dominated the game. Rennes were very good. We had a lot of pace in the first half and in the second half we had the chance to make it two but Mandanda was impressive,” PSG boss Luis Enrique said. “Cups in any country are particularly important and this has been one of our objectives since the start of the season.” 
The final at the end of next month could end up being Mbappe’s last game as a PSG player, with the 25-year-old having informed the club of his intention to depart after this season when his contract expires. 
The Ligue 1 season concludes on May 18, although the Champions League final will be played in London on June 1 — PSG, who are top of the Ligue 1 standings, are still alive in Europe and face Barcelona in the first leg of the quarter-final next week. 
“Before we think about the Champions League, we have to think about Clermont Foot [in Ligue 1]. It’s important for the team to perform at a high level in all competitions,” Luis Enrique added. “Playing against my former team [Barca] will be nice but I want us to be competitive and play a great game.

9,"Arsenal reclaim top spot, City stay close",LONDON: The three-way race for the Premier League title looks likely to go down to the wire after wins for Arsenal...,"LONDON: The three-way race for the Premier League title looks likely to go down to the wire after wins for Arsenal and Manchester City made it even tighter at the top.  
Arsenal returned to the summit with a comfortable 2-0 victory over relegation-threatened Luton Town, while City crushed Aston Villa 4-1 to keep their hopes of retaining the title very much alive by going level on points with second-placed Liverpool.  
Just one point separates the top three teams in what is shaping up to be the most compelling title fight in recent history. But it is three-time defending champions City who have the pedigree. 
“If we are in and around it with 10 games to go then we know we are capable,” said City forward Phil Foden, who scored a hat trick against Villa. “We are in and around it again now so it is still possible. We have to keep believing. That was what the manager was big on today, believe and fight until the end.” 
Liverpool had taken advantage of their two rivals drawing 0-0 on Sunday and moved two points clear at the top. 
By the end of Wednesday’s games, Jurgen Klopp’s team were playing catch-up to Arsenal again and were ahead of City only on goal difference — even if they have a game in hand on both. 
The question for Arsenal is whether they can go the distance after falling away so badly at the end of last season.  
The Londoners led the table for 248 days before eventually being overtaken by a City team that won their third title in a row and completed a treble of trophies which also included the Champions League and FA Cup.  
Mikel Arteta’s players have already improved head-to-head against City — winning and drawing against the defending champions. But it remains to be seen how they handle the pressure with just eight league games to go. 
While Arsenal were expected to beat relegation-threatened Luton at home, there was always the potential for a slip.  
That never looked likely after Martin Odegaard’s sweet left-footed strike opened the scoring in the 24th minute and an own goal from Daiki Hashioka in the 44th after good work by Emile Smith Rowe made it 2-0 by halftime.  
Arteta opted to shuffle his pack with Declan Rice on the bench and Bukayo Saka not involved while Smith Rowe, Reiss Nelson and Thomas Partey were all given starts. But his side showed their strength in depth to cruise to victory. 
“We want to be at the top — winning our games is the only thing we can do,” Arsenal manager Arteta told the BBC. “We managed to rotate and freshen the team up a bit. Those who came in did really, 
really well.” 
Defeat for depleted Luton leaves Rob Edwards’ side third from bottom of the English top flight, three points from safety, and facing an immediate return to the Championship.  
Brentford drew 0-0 with Brighton & Hove Albion to edge further clear of the drop zone. 
FODEN HITS HAT-TRICK 
Foden shone in the absence of Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne as the England international’s hat-trick powered City to a thumping win against Villa as the champions responded emphatically to questions over their ability to win the biggest games. 
City’s victory was their first over a top-five team in the league this season. 
“Something we’ve been struggling with this season to face the teams at the top — beating Aston Villa 4-1 is not easy but we did it,” Rodri told TNT Sports. “We’re there, we knew we had to do our homework. We did it and now we focus on the next game.” 
Pep Guardiola showed faith in the depth of his squad by leaving Haaland and De Bruyne on the bench for the full 90 minutes ahead of a hectic schedule in their defence of three competitions. 
“The schedule is terrible and we have to bring energy. Everybody has to be involved,” said Guardiola on his decision to leave out Haaland and De Bruyne. 
Guardiola has hailed Foden as the best player in the English top-flight this season and the 23-year-old backed up his manager’s words by taking his goal tally for the season to 21 with three supremely taken strikes. 
“Phil, when he plays in a central position, he has a sense of goal,” added Guardiola. “He’s a really top class player -- he has a natural talent, a gift.” 
City monopolised possession from kickoff and took the lead in the 11th minute when Rodri poked in Jeremy Doku’s cross. 
Villa silenced the home crowd, however, when 20-year-old Jhon Duran slotted into the far corner after a neat one-two with Morgan Rogers in the 20th minute. 
City restored their lead just before half-time to calm the rising tension among the Etihad crowd thanks to Foden finding a gap in Villa’s wall with a superb free kick just before halftime. 
Rodri dribbled through Villa’s defence before laying the ball off for Foden to claim his second in the 62nd minute and the 23-year-old completed his hat-trick with a rocket into the top corner from 25 yards.

10,Mandragora stunner gives Fiorentina advantage in Italian Cup semi,FLORENCE: Fiorentina edged a step closer to another Coppa Italia final with a 1-0 home win over Atalanta in the ...,"FLORENCE: Fiorentina edged a step closer to another Coppa Italia final with a 1-0 home win over Atalanta in the first leg of their semi-final on Wednesday, courtesy of a stunning first-half strike by midfielder Rolando Mandragora. 
Fiorentina, who lost last year’s final to Inter Milan 2-1, are looking to lift the club’s first trophy since they won the cup in 2001. 
Italian Mandragora decided the clash in Florence in the 31st minute with a rocket of a shot from outside the box, which ricocheted in off the post. 
His goal, sent into the net from 27.6 metres, is the longest-distance goal scored by Fiorentina this season across all competitions. 
Vincenzo Italiano’s Fiorentina are now slight favourites to reach the final for the second straight year before the second leg in Bergamo on April 24. 
The Tuscan outfit were also losing finalists in last season’s Europa Conference League. 
“The final is not one step away, even if we had scored another goal it would have been tough anyway,” Italiano told Mediaset. “Atalanta at home close you in your own half... We know that we will have to play an amazing match there.” 
Should they go through Fiorentina will face either fierce rivals Juventus or Lazio in next month’s final. 
Juve are 2-0 ahead in their last-four tie after dominating their Roman opponents on Tuesday night.

The 24-year-old was shot in the chest at a petrol station on Wednesday night and the assailants drove off in his vehicle.
“While waiting to be served by the petrol attendant, he was confronted by two armed males,” police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Mavela Masondo told reporters, adding no arrests had yet been made.
Centre-back Fleurs played every minute for South Africa at the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021, and that same year was called up to the senior team for World Cup qualifiers against Ethiopia, though he did not make it off the bench and was uncapped.
“We woke up to the heartbreaking and devastating news of the passing of this young life. This is such a huge loss for his family, friends, his teammates and football in general. We are all grieving this young mans passing,” South African Football Association president Danny Jordaan said in a statement.
South Africa’s Minister of Sport, Arts & Culture Zizi Kodwa said he was  “saddened that yet another life has been cut short due to violent crime”.
Fleurs joined Chiefs from SuperSport United in October, having come through the Ubuntu Football Academy in Cape Town.
