0,Investigators hunt source of ‘toxic letters’,PM vows to unearth plot behind letters; Punjab govt forms its own task force.,"• Forensic tests reveal letters contained ‘traces of arsenic’, not anthrax
• CTD Islamabad expands probe after letters traced to Rawalpindi GPO
• PM vows to unearth plot behind letters; Punjab govt forms its own task force
ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: As Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed to solve the mystery of ‘toxic letters’ received by around 17 judges of the superior courts, the Counter-Terrorism Depart­ment of the police seems to be in a bind in its efforts to trace those behind these letters.
Investigators in the capital have traced these letters to the General Post Office in Rawalpindi, but due to the absence of CCTV cameras on the premises, the senders have yet to be identified.
After the letters were opened by the court staff, it was widely believed that the suspicious powder in the envelopes was ‘anthrax’, a harmful substance that causes an infection upon contact with skin.
However, forensic analysis has revealed that the letters sent to LHC judges did not contain anthrax, rather “carbohydrates having arsenic traces”.
Initial investigations have revealed that the arsenic was not in its pure form.
“There were no traces of anthrax or any other toxic chemicals,” sources told Dawn. They added the investigating agencies had also been instructed to trace the fingerprints on the envelopes to catch the attackers.
The Punjab Safe City Authority had also been instructed to trace the senders of the suspicious letters through its surveillance cameras installed across the provincial capital.
At Thursday’s cabinet meeting, PM Shehbaz Sharif vowed to unearth the plot apparently aimed at threatening judges of superior courts through letters carrying a suspicious powder.
“The government is investigating the matter with the sense of responsibility to uncover the reality,” the prime minister said in his speech at the federal cabinet.
Task force formed
In response to the letters received by the Lahore High Court judges, the home department held a meeting in the provincial capital atten­ded by top police and forensic officials. The meeting reviewed the toxic substances found in the envelopes. The meeting did not rule out the role of foreign agencies and decided to expand the canvas of the investigation. According to sources, the CTD constituted a task force headed by the DIG to trace the culprits and their motives behind sending these documents.
With regard to the protection of judges and their staff members, the home department and other line agencies have decided that the judges be provided scanning machines to scan before opening suspicious letters or envelopes. It was also decided that all Lahore High Court judges’ staff members be offered training besides equipping them with gadgets to handle suspicious letters and articles in an informed manner.
GPO Rawalpindi
As the investigation in Islamabad inched forward, the CTD team led by DIG Shahzad Nadeem Bukhari traced the letters sent to the Supreme Court and the Islamabad High Court to the General Post Office in Rawalpindi.
Sources privy to the investigation told Dawn that following the delivery of these ‘toxic’ letters to the judges of the apex court and the high courts, the investigation team had managed to establish that they were dispatched from the Rawalpindi GPO and the sender mailed all these letters through a post box.
Though the letterbox has been identified, the identity of the sender was still not known.
Sources said that the efforts were being made to trace the sender through CCTV footage and the authorities concerned had been asked to furnish the footage.
Sources said that it was difficult to ascertain who brought these letters to the post office since there were no cameras installed inside the crowded premises. According to sources, the investigation team has asked adjacent offices and buildings to share footage from their respective CCTV cameras.
When contacted, Islamabad Police Spokesperson Taqi Jawad told Dawn that the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) was investigating the case. According to him, DIG Operations Syed Shehzad Nadeem Bukhari was personally supervising the investigation. He expressed hope that the investigation team would trace the senders soon.
Following the incident, the IHC administration took several precautionary measures and the administration has decided to return all letters without a proper sender’s address.
The letters to the top court sent by an unknown group ‘Tehreek-i-Namoos-i-Pakistan’ accused the judiciary of “pretending to do justice” and claimed the struggle for petty politics and vested interests would not be tolerated anymore. The text threatened that the toxic substance in the envelopes was a warning for others to ‘repent’ or face the consequences. The phrase “Welocme [sic] to Bacilus anthracis [sic] !!!” was also written along with a photo of a human skull and bones.

1,Pakistan rules out talks with TTP,• Foreign Office calls for decisive action against militant outfits based in Afghanistan  • Slams Mirwaiz’s house arrest in held,"• Foreign Office calls for decisive action against militant outfits based in Afghanistan
• Slams Mirwaiz’s house arrest in held Kashmir
• Flays Israeli attack on Iranian embassy in Damascus
ISLAMABAD: In a veiled rebuff to the Afghan Taliban’s latest appeal for dialogue with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamabad on Thursday firmly dismissed the prospect of peace talks with the militant group, instead urging Afghanistan’s de facto rulers to take decisive action against it.
“Pakistan is not holding any talks with the terrorist organisation, the TTP. We have no plans to hold these talks with TTP,” Foreign Office spokeswoman Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said at the weekly media briefing.
Her remarks were directed at a statement of Afghanistan’s Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Nabi Omari, who asked Islamabad and TTP to resolve their issues through dialogue as the violence in Pakistan “was spreading to Afghanistan”.
Ms Baloch said Pakistan expected the Afghan authorities to take action against Pakistani terrorists, who have taken up sanctuaries in Afghanistan for the violence they are perpetrating here.
Islamabad took a tougher line on the issue of terrorist threats from Afghanistan, as the 19th meeting of the National Security Advisers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation on Thursday expressed their concerns about the presence of terrorist groups in Afghanistan and the resultant threat to the countries in the region. National Security Division Secretary Waqar Ahmad led the Pakistan delegation at the meeting.
The presence of terrorist sanctuaries within Afghanistan has significantly strained the relationship between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban, a group historically supported by Islamabad. Despite repeated requests from Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban have not taken measures to prevent militants from launching attacks from these safe havens. This issue became more pronounced after the TTP escalated their violent activities following the collapse of peace talks brokered by the Afghan Taliban in late 2022.
Recent developments have heightened suspicions regarding Afghanistan’s involvement in the attack on March 26 in Bisham, which resulted in the death of five Chinese nationals. This speculation gained traction particularly after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, in the aftermath of a high-level security meeting, explicitly labelled Afghanistan as a “source of terrorism”.
Moreover, the communiqué issued by the participants of that meeting indirectly implicated Afghanistan by highlighting the issue of “sanctuaries available to terrorists across the borders”.
However, the Foreign Office spokesperson said the investigation in Bisham incident were continuing and the matter would be raised with Afghan Taliban “if there is a clear connection”.
Ms Baloch reminded that there had previously been repeated incidents of terrorism inside Pakistan, which were planned and executed by elements based inside Afghanistan. “We expect the Afghan authorities to take urgent, immediate action against all terror groups,” she added.
Israel’s aggression
In a condemnation of Israel’s continued aggression, Ms Baloch highlighted ongoing violations of international law, including an attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus and strikes on a humanitarian convoy in Gaza.
The Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate, she said, marked a significant breach of the UN Charter and international norms. She noted that the attack on a convoy from the NGO World Central Kitchen in Gaza was part of a series of actions over the last six months targeting UNRWA, humanitarian relief organisations and unarmed civilians in violation of international humanitarian law.
“Deliberate targeting of a humanitarian convoy, bringing food to people facing famine, is a serious violation of international humanitarian law. The attack has taken place at a time when Israel is creating hurdles in UNRWA’s efforts to bring food and vital lifesaving aid to the people of Gaza. We condemn these atrocities and call for international accountability of Israel for its crimes against humanity,” she said.
The Foreign Office welcomed the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) recent provisional measures ordered on March 28 in response to the deteriorating situation in Gaza. The ICJ’s rulings call for the immediate provision of humanitarian assistance, including food, water, electricity, fuel, and medical supplies, to Palestinians in Gaza, highlighting the worsening of the crisis due to Israeli obstructions.
The ICJ’s decision, she noted, underscores Israel’s continued defiance of international legal orders, emphasising the need for accountability and action to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Ms Baloch reiterated Pakistan’s call for the swift implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2728, adopted on March 25.
Mirwaiz Farooq’s detention
The spokeswoman condemned Indian authorities’ decision to prohibit Eidul Fitr prayers at the Eidgah in Srinagar as the holy month of Ramazan concludes. She highlighted the house detention of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, the chief cleric of Srinagar’s historic Jama Mosque and a prominent Kashmiri leader, preventing him from commemorating an event in honour of his ancestor, the late Mirwaiz Molvi Muhammad Yousuf Shah.
According to Ms Baloch, this move is part of a longstanding pattern by Indian occupation authorities to impose restrictions on religious gatherings and curb the activities of Kashmiri religious leaders, especially during significant religious occasions in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).
“Imposing restrictions on Kashmiri religious leaders and restraining the Kashmiri public from congregating on special religious occasions have become pervasive in IIOJK,” she said.
She urged the Indian authorities to uphold the rights of the people in India-held Kashmir to peaceful assembly and to practise their religion freely.
The spokesperson also condemned the attacks on police stations and other installations in the Iranian cities of Chabahar and Rask.

2,"Foreign ministry ‘unmoved’ by cipher’s loss, lawyer Salman Safdar tells IHC",Says that the interior ministry had “hijacked the case for no reason”.,"ISLAMABAD: A lawyer representing former prime minister Imran Khan on Thursday raised concerns over the handling of the cipher case, alleging that the foreign ministry was seemingly unbothered by the document’s disappearance, despite being its custodian, and that the interior ministry had “hijacked the case for no reason”.
Presenting arguments before a division bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, Barrister Salman Safdar sought the suspension of Imran Khan and Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s sentences in the cipher case.
However, the bench declined the request, opting instead for a swift decision on their appeals.
Mr Khan is accused of misusing the cipher — a confidential diplomatic communication — for political gain and endangering national security by disclosing and misplacing it. Mr Safdar contended that the cipher still exists in Foreign Office records, and its transcribed version has been shared with eight individuals.
Mr Safdar said the Foreign Office sent a copy of the cipher to Azam Khan, the principal secretary to the then-prime minister, Imran Khan. Mr Azam alleged he handed over a copy to Mr Khan, who failed to return it. The counsel said this might be negligence, not a crime, adding that Mr Khan could not be convicted for mere negligence.
He said that when the cipher went missing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not show any concern, nor did it issue any letter to the Prime Minister’s Office.
He said that when the PMO informed the foreign ministry that their copy of the cipher was missing, the foreign secretary replied that a copy of this confidential document could not be issued and advised the PMO staff to try to find the cipher.
Mr Safdar also pointed out that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) issued a notice to Mr Khan seven months after the receipt of the cipher, whereas the former PM could have retained it for a year.
Justice Aurangzeb noted that if Azam Khan was the only witness of handing over the cipher’s copy to Mr Khan, in case his testimony is excluded, there would be no evidence that the cipher was misplaced from the former premier’s custody.
The judge also inquired under what law the copy of the cipher could be retained for a year. Mr Safdar replied that the prosecution had taken this stance during the initial hearings.
When the court inquired how long the counsel would take to conclude the arguments, the former prime minister’s counsel replied that he would conclude it by the next session.
The court set the next hearing for April 16.

3,10 Iranian soldiers killed in border province attacks,"Pakistan strongly condemns attacks, expresses concern over growing militancy in the region.","TEHRAN: Militant atta­cks in southeastern Iran near the border with Pakis­tan killed 10 security personnel, state media repo­rted on Thursday, doubling an earlier toll.
The militant group Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice) claimed responsibility for the attacks in Sistan-Baluchestan — the province which has for years faced unrest involving drug smuggling gangs and militant groups.
Pakistan strongly condemned the attacks and expressed concern over growing militancy in the region.
 






“Pakistan unequivocally condemns the heinous and dastardly terrorist attacks at police and security installations,” the foreign ministry in Islamabad said.
“We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and pray for the recovery of the injured.”
It added that Pakistan “is deeply concerned about the growing acts of terrorism in our region”.
“The case of the terrorist attacks was closed with the martyrdom of 10 members of the security forces,” and the killing of 18 “terrorists”, Iran’s state television said.
Majid Mirahmadi, vice minister of the interior, had earlier told the channel that five members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the police died during two night-time attacks against a Guards base in Rask and a police post in Chabahar.
“The terrorists had planned to seize military bases,” Mirahmadi later told state television, adding that “none of them survived” the clashes. He added that the assailants appeared to be foreigners, without providing further details.
The number of assailants killed in the clashes also rose from the 15 which General Mohammad Pakpour, who heads the Guards’ land forces, had announced on television.
Jaish al-Adl claimed the attacks on its Telegram channel. Formed in 2012, it is listed as a “terrorist” group by Iran and also by the United States.
The group also claimed responsibility for an attack in December that killed 11 officers at a police station in Rask, one of the deadliest in years. The group claimed another Rask police station attack that killed one officer on January 10.
A week later, Iran said it retaliated with drone and missile strikes against Jaish al-Adl targets over the border in Pakistan.
In response, Pakistan said it carried out air strikes against Baluchi separatists inside Iran.
The Iranian strikes killed at least two children, according to Pakistan, while Pakistan’s strikes killed at least nine people in Iran, according to the official IRNA news agency.

4,US threatens policy shift if Israeli excesses continue,"In call with Netanyahu, Biden demands immediate ceasefire.","• In call with Netanyahu, Biden demands immediate ceasefire
• Conditions military aid to Tel Aviv with safety of aid workers, Palestinian civilians
• Jill Biden among ‘strongest voices’ calling for end to Gaza war: NYT report
WASHINGTON: The United States on Thursday issued its strongest public rebuke toward Israel since it launched an invasion of Gaza, seeking for the first time to leverage US aid to influence Israeli military behavior.
President Joe Biden, a staunch supporter of the Israeli offensive until now, called for an immediate ceasefire in a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, conditioning support for its offensive on concrete steps to address the safety of aid workers and Palestinian civilians.
The rebuke followed an attack on a World Central Kitchen charity convoy this week that killed seven food aid workers.
The White House had described Biden as outraged and heartbroken by the attack but, prior to Thursday’s call, the president had made no fundamental change in Washington’s steadfast support for Israel in its conflict against Palestinian Hamas militants.
During the call, Biden “underscored that an immediate ceasefire is essential to stabilise and improve the humanitarian situation and protect innocent civilians,” the White House said.
It said Biden “made clear the need for Israel to announce and implement a series of specific, concrete, and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers”.
He “made clear that US policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel’s immediate action on these steps,” the White House said in a statement.
The statement reflected a sharp change in Biden’s tone and, for what appears to be the first time, a set of strings atta­ched to continued US support. Biden staunchly supported Israel, even when other governments sought to put more pressure on it.
His comments marked the first time the US has suggested it would condition its continued support.
During a briefing with reporters after the call, White House spokesperson John Kirby declined to elaborate on what specific changes the US would make on its policy toward Israel and Gaza. He said Washington hopes to see an announcement of Israeli steps in the “coming hours and days”.
Jill Biden
US First Lady Jill Biden is reportedly one of the most ‘heartbroken’ by the civilian deaths in Gaza and has been urging her husband to end the war, the US media reported on Wednesday.
Quoting a participant at a Ramazan event that the president held on Tuesday, The New York Times reported that Mrs Biden was not happy with his backing for Israel.
The reports describe her as one of the strongest voices in the White House calling for an end to the war.
The reports also included a quote from the first lady’s communications director, Elizabeth Alexander, who said: “Just like the president, the first lady is heartbroken over the attacks on aid workers and the ongoing loss of innocent lives in Gaza. They both want Israel to do more to protect civilians.”
Earlier this week, Biden met Muslim community leaders — something the first lady reportedly said she disapproved of because of his support for Israel in the conflict, according to the New York Times.
One guest, Salima Suswell, the founder of the Black Muslim Leadership Council, said that President Biden recounted that his wife had been urging him to, “stop it, stop it now”.
CNN and some other media outlets reported that during the Iftar dinner, a guest confronted Mr. Biden, saying that his wife had asked him not to attend the meeting due to the president’s support for Israel.
In response, Mr. Biden stated that he understood because his own wife, Jill, had put pressure on him over the matter. Another guest, Palestinian American physician Thaer Ahmad, said he raised his voice over killings in Gaza and gave President Biden a note and a picture of an 8-year-old orphan from Rafah, which Israel intends to attack next. According to Dr. Ahmad, Mr. Biden responded, saying, “I understand”.
Pressure from Democrats
Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers have also increased their pressure on Mr. Biden to do more to increase humanitarian aid and end the war. They are urging him to use the leverage afforded by the billions of dollars in US military aid to persuade Israel to stop its offensive now.
“I think we’re at that point,” Chris Coons, a Biden confidant and senator from the president’s home state of Delaware, told CNN.
If Israel begins its long-threatened full-scale offensive in the southern city of Rafah without plans for the 1.5 million people sheltering there, “I would vote to condition aid to Israel,” Mr Coons said. “I’ve never said that before, I’ve never been there before,” he added.
Another Democratic senator, Chris Murphy, who heads the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on the Middle East, said that Israel “needs to pause military operations in Gaza right now.”
Yet another Democrat, Senator Elizabeth Warren, said that she would block the sale of F-15s to Israel after an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers.
In an interview with CNN, she said the US Congress had a “responsibility to act” and accused Israel of violating laws that require access to humanitarian relief.
“I hope this will be the moment where the president changes course,” said Chris Van Hollen, a Democratic Senator from Maryland.
“Netanyahu ignored the president’s requests, and yet we send 2,000-pound bombs with no restrictions on their use,” he added.
Biden, who has described himself as a Zionist, supported Israel staunchly in the early days of its retaliation. But as the Gaza death toll rose and the war widened with new fronts in Lebanon and Yemen emerging, his administration began pushing for a ceasefire and urging humanitarian aid access. Last month, the US abstained from a UN Security Council vote demanding a ceasefire, drawing Israeli anger.
Biden also faces deep Democratic anger over his handling of the Gaza war, a dynamic that could depress support in November’s election contest against Republican former president Donald Trump.
Laura Blumenfeld, a Middle East analyst at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies in Washington, said the strike on WCK aid workers “was the last straw.” “This call was the long-promised ‘come to Jesus conversation’ that Biden said last month he would have with Netanyahu,” Blumenfeld said.
