A gas utility spokesman said that in a counter gas theft operation a raid was conducted at the vicinity in the heart of the city where gas was illegally suppled to 2,500 houses from SSGC’s 63-mm line through three tapping points. He said that theft volume was estimated at 2,400,000 cms per year (Rs75,000,000).
The spokesman said that the SSGC had intensified its crack down on gas thieves across its franchise areas of Sindh and Balochistan, and the Counter Gas Theft Operations (CGTO) Wing along with Recovery Department were disconnecting illegal connections of customers who were stealing gas directly through domestic meters for commercial activities.
He said that raids were also conducted in old city areas, including f Soldier Bazar, Ranchore Line and Ram Swamy where five meters were found tampered and three others were found passing unregistered gas.
Besides, the spokesman said, the raiding team also cracked down on Shanti Nagar, Sindhi Para, in Gulshan-e-Iqbal, where eight houses were being supplied gas through rubber pipes.

While the police claimed that it was not a robbery-related incident, relatives of the deceased said the victim was killed by robbers over resistance.
Orangi Town SHO Jamal Leghari said 30-year-old Mohammed Asif, who sold plastic bags and utensils, left his shop at Banaras to deposit cash at a nearby bank branch to be transferred to his native place in Bahawalpur.
As soon as he reached his shop after depositing Rs250,000 in the bank, the police said, armed motorcyclists arrived there, shot him after a short scuffle and rode away. He suffered a single bullet wound, which proved fatal. 
The SHO claimed that it was not a robbery-related incident as the killers did not take away anything.
Victim’s uncle Mohammed Hanif told the media at the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital that Asif has been doing business in Karachi for the last eight years. “Karachi is no longer worthy of living,” said the grief-stricken man.
The victim had recently purchased a Suzuki van on instalments.

4,"Construction continues at Karachi Seaview despite stay order, SHC told","Court official inspects seafront, finds withering plants, dilapidated beach parks.","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) was informed that despite a restraining order, several construction activities were being carried out at the Seaview beach and the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) could not justify such developments. 
A court official (nazir) in his inspection report also said officials of the DHA and Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC) were directed to submit details about the constructions and Seaview beach development project, but despite the lapse of considerable time the same was being awaited till finalisation of the report.
On the directive of the SHC, the nazir had carried out the inspection of Seaview bench from Nishan-i-Pakistan to Clock Tower in order to examine the present status of the construction and other activities, in the presence of relevant parties.
The nazir in his report placed before the SHC also stated that a seven to eight feet tall stonewall was found to be built between Nishan-i-Pakistan to Clock Tower and as per officials of the CBC, the objective of such a wall was to protect the project from sand. 

Court official inspects seafront, finds withering plants, dilapidated beach parks  

Some sections of the beach park, located between Clock Tower to Chunky Monkey Amusement Park, had been found in dilapidated condition and, additionally, the coconut and palm trees/plants had been observed to be dead, the report added.
It also stated that a service road was being used for charged parking and the persons wearing jackets of the CBC were present there to collect parking fee.
A health café and ground-plus-one-floor restaurant was found constructed and another ground-plus-one-floor restaurant, and other construction works were being carried out at the Seaview bench, it maintained.
The report further said that a total of 11 food kiosks were found in partially decaying condition and seven to eight small shops were also appeared to be constructed while a room was also being built as labourers informed the nazir that it would be used for generator/machinery for the purpose of under-construction storm water drains and a premises was being used for information/rescue and the DHA security vigilance.
An open drain of untreated domestic sewage waste was also found discharging filthy water and waste directly into the sea and heaps of debris were found lying at two places, the report added.
It also submitted that eight under-construction storm water drains were also found from Clock Tower to Nisan-i-Pakistan Park and besides washrooms and prayer area, walkways and wooden seating arrangements were also available.
“Upon query from the DHA officials with regard to approval/permission of construction, they did not provide any information and could not justify the same. Hence, officials of the DHA and CBC were directed to submit detailed reports with regard to available constructions and the Seaview bench development project for placing the same before the Hon’ble Court. However, despite a lapse of considerable time the same is still awaited till the finalisation of the report,” it added.
The court official also submitted that as per the report filed by a director the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa), the proponent of the project namely the CBC had submitted the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) in December 2019 for the beach development project (from Nisan-i-Pakistan Park to Clock Tower).
After careful review and compliance with the legal formalities, Sepa said the subject project had been approved in February 2020, it added.
After taking the nazir’s report on record, the two-judge bench headed by Justice Salahuddin Panhwar said the respective parties would be at liberty to file objections, if any, and adjourned the hearing till May 6.
Last month, representing the petitioners, Zubair Ahmed Abro had pointed out several construction activities at the Seaview bench while the lawyers for the DHA and CBA had contended that they had not permitted any new constructions.
Thereafter, the SHC had appointed the nazir for inspection and directed the DHA and CBC to ensure that no new constructions should be carried out and that the construction activities must also be stopped till further orders. 
Arif Belgaumi and others had petitioned the SHC in 2022 against the alleged commercialisation of the seafront from Nishan-i-Pakistan Park to Village Restaurant (Now Clock Tower) in the Phase-V of the DHA.
The petitioners had contended that an environmental tribunal had already set aside the IEE approval accorded by Sepa to the proposed commercialisation.

6,Man in Karachi sentenced to 14 years in prison for acid attack on wife,Court imposes fine of Rs1 million and directs that the amount be given to the complainant in compensation.,"KARACHI: A sessions court sentenced a man who threw acid on his wife to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment. 
Additional district and Sessions Judge (East) Muhammad Ilyas Memon of the gender-based court, convicted Kausar Abbas for throwing acid on his wife Saima, who had suffered 31 per cent burn injuries on her body. 
The court also imposed a fine of Rs1 million and directed that the amount be given to the complainant in compensation, otherwise, the convict would undergo an additional six-month imprisonment on default. 
“The accused being addicted led to his wife’s relocation to her parental house and his subsequent suspicion of her extramarital affair (as evident from the charge sheet), is the apparent root cause of his aggression, which steered him to commit this offence,” the court observed. 
According to state prosecutor Kubra Syed, complainant Saima stated in her statement recorded at the hospital that her husband was addicted to narcotics and would often ask her for money to buy drugs. 
Due to his behaviour, she left their home and stayed with her brother. On March 19, 2021, her husband came to the house and demanded more money to buy narcotics. However, when the complainant refused, he threatened her and threw a bottle of acid on her, causing her burn injuries. 
A neighbour took her to hospital upon hearing her cries. 
On the other hand, the defence argued that the complainant had falsely accused their client, with the support of her mother, brother, and the police. 
However, the court noted that the FIR was registered as the police approached her in a hospital following the incident, and she accused her husband, adding that therefore, there was no time for her to consult with police and falsely implicate her husband. 
The court observed that the victim presented her evidence naturally and remained consistent during cross-examination, adding that the court found her testimony to be trustworthy and reliable. 
Regarding the victim’s clothing, which was not secured by the police as evidence, the court noted that this suggests fault on the part of the investigating officer, who failed to secure the clothing. This cannot be attributed to the victim or anyone else, as they are not legal experts.

Built on the far side of the sprawling and historic Burns Garden, which has trees older than Pakistan, the building has been storing — for preservation and display — invaluable artefacts and manuscripts representing a wide variety of subjects, ranging from religion to literature and from the Pakistan movement to rare artworks.
While going through old copies of this newspaper, one comes across interesting nuggets of information. One of them, for example, is that in 1964 a chair used by the greatest Urdu poet Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib was to be given to the museum by an archaeologist from Delhi, Dr Iftikhar Ahmed. One is not sure whether that chair was ever handed over to the museum; and if it was, it’s still there. But one has seen rare manuscripts of Mir Taqi Mir’s collections.
Talking to Dawn, National Museum curator Omar Qureshi dispelled the notion that exhibitions don’t take place at the facility as often as they should. 
He said, “We hold exhibitions regularly. In fact, a few television channels cover it. We held one show on Women’s Day, one on March 23 which can be seen on the first floor of the building.”
Shedding light on rare objects that the museum contains, he said, “With respect to archaeology, we have a huge collection. We have 100,000 artefacts. They are prehistoric pieces as well as those from Gandhara times etc. Every six to eight months we change displays. We have 11 galleries. We have a big number of manuscripts, too.”
The ongoing exhibition with reference to the holy month of Ramazan has a beautiful and rare collection of the Holy Quran. It’s a must-see, soul-enriching display. 
About the show Mr Qureshi said, “There are rare nuskhey of the Holy Quran. Then we have one made with dhaga (thread). The Holy Quran collection belongs to the museum. But some of the exhibits are borrowed.”

8,"Rising crimes can force people to take up arms, Hafiz Naeem warns","Attends funeral prayers for Hamid, who was killed by bandits in North Karachi","KARACHI: Seeking recruitment of Karachiites in police force, the Jamaat-i-Islami on Thursday warned that the ‘failure’ of the Pakistan Peoples Party government in controlling street crimes in the metropolis could force the citizens to ‘take the matter into their own hands’. 
“People can get arms licences, erect barriers in their streets and set up committees at mohalla level to fight the menace on their own,” JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman said. 
Speaking to reporters after attending the funeral prayers of Syed Hamid Ali, a senior party worker who was killed by armed bandits in North Karachi on Wednesday for resisting the mugging attempt, he also made it clear that his party would stand by the people of the city whenever such a consensus emerged and would lead Karachiites from the front for their safety. 
He went a step further and warned that in such an emerging situation, the party and the people won’t oblige the law-enforcement agencies if they objected to the measures adopted by citizens for their own safety against street crimes. 

Attends funeral prayers for Hamid, who was killed by bandits in North Karachi 

“Now these cosmetic measures [suspension of SHOs over street crime complaints] won’t work,” said Hafiz Naeem. 
“Don’t push the people to that extent that they take up the matter in their own hands. If you [Sindh government and police authorities] can’t do your job, then let us do ours. Let the people put barriers in their streets and get arms licences. We would be among the people to set up committees. And then the police and Rangers won’t have any right to raise objections to the people’s moves.”
Number of Karachiites in police force
He raised the issue of number of Karachiites in the city police force and demanded the management control of the key law-enforcement department under the local bodies system which could allow the grass-root representatives of the people to keep a check on performance of such personnel and question them in case of any failure. 
“Now the people would have to take to the street,” he said. “After Eid we will launch a strong movement against street crimes in Karachi. We will stage sit-ins outside CM House after Eid. If people of Karachi are not safe in their homes, streets and markets, then how can our rulers feel safe in their palaces or forts like homes? We would not let this to happen. We would make them realise what insecurity actually means to common Karachiites.”
He said the PPP government had put people on the mercy of armed robbers as the growing crime rate in the city reflected a total failure and patronage of crime on part of the government, the police and other law-enforcement agencies. 
“As many as 14 innocent Karachiites have lost their lives for offering resistance against robbers in Ramzan alone, while the police high-ups instead of curbing crimes advise citizens not to resist against criminals,” he said. 
“There’s no law and order in Karachi and the police authorities are busy in either protocol or VIP security. The PPP has lost every moral ground to continue its rule in Sindh whereas in rural areas armed gangs of bandits have become a symbol of terror and in urban areas people are losing lives only for resisting armed robberies.”

9,Police require more time to control crime: DIG,Says release of ‘criminals’ on bail is a serious issue,"• Says release of ‘criminals’ on bail is a serious issue
• Defends police performance by saying five ‘robbers’ were killed in past 10 days in 33 encounters              
KARACHI: Against the backdrop of rising street crimes and break down of law and order in the city, a top police officer admitted on Thursday that the metropolis was facing an ‘extra-ordinary situation’ which required ‘extra-ordinary’ steps to control the menace. However, the policy of suspending SHOs of affected areas was thoroughly discussed between police and government authorities and in his opinion police should be given ‘more time’ to control crime in Karachi.  
West-Zone DIG Irfan Ali Baloch who was speaking at a press conference at his office, announced that specials teams had been formed to investigate from where street criminals were getting arms.  
A suspected robber who had shot dead a shopkeeper recently in Bilal Colony was gunned down in an ‘encounter’ on Thursday while his accomplice was arrested in wounded condition, the DIG announced.  
Sharing details, he said that on March 24, a shopkeeper, 23-year-old Abdul Rehman, was gunned down in Bilal Colony of New Karachi. Police with the help of technical and human intelligence conducted a raid during which they killed one suspect, Afzal Husain, in encounter and arrested his accomplice, Osama in wounded condition.  
He said the killed suspect had a past criminal record as there were 13 FIRs registered against him.  
He said that separately, the West police had busted an eight-member gang as part of their strategy to eliminate gangs involved in crimes.  
The held suspects were involved in 15 robberies. He said that during the last 10 days, 33 encounters took place in which five robbers were killed while 32 arrested in wounded condition. Those 31 wounded suspects were ‘repeat offenders,’ he added.  
Mr Baloch observed that suspects were often arrested, sent to jails and released on bail and started committing crimes again, which was a serious issue.  
He said special investigation teams had been formed to investigate the held suspects for the first time, particularly to ascertain where they got arms from, adding that the weapons seized from the criminals were brought from ‘Dara’ but they used POF bullets.  
In response to a question, the DIG said that the murder of a cyclist in Orangi was a ‘targeted killing’ and not robbery-related while they were trying to ascertain the exact motive behind the murder of an estate agent in Gulshan-i-Maymar and injuries to his friend.  
He said the victims had drawn cash from a bank and given it to someone on their way. Their car had tinted glasses and armed pillion riders fired on them while riding the bike. Thus they had doubts that it was a robbery-related incident. 
The DIG said that both political leadership and police were unanimous that the ongoing wave of violent street crimes should be controlled and the government’s decision of suspending SHOs after violent street crime was also aimed at showing that the SHOs should take the issue seriously.  
Asked whether the SHOs had started terming robbery-related murders as ‘personal enmity’ to avoid being suspended, the DIG Irfan Baloch said that there was a lot of discussion as to whether the SHOs should be suspended or not. He said that in his personal opinion, the SHOs should be given ‘time’ to control the rising crimes but hastened to add that ‘extra-ordinary situations demanded extra-ordinary steps’.  
He said that there were ‘weaknesses’ in the criminal justice system, due to which the repeat offenders got bail. Besides, there were also ‘shortcomings’ in police investigation and prosecution as well, he added.  
“We may have some weaknesses but we are also making serious efforts to bring down the ongoing wave of robbery-cum-murder and robbery-cum-injury incidents,” he said, recalling that there was a time when up to 20 people were being killed in Karachi on daily basis but those targeted killings had also been controlled.  
He claimed that after the recent crackdown against the criminals, street crimes had been reduced up to 20pc in West Zone as per call data of 15-Madadgar.  
He opined that giving the task of robbery-cum-murder cases to SIU would help the police.

The anniversary was observed with utmost simplicity in honour of the holy month of Ramazan on districts level throughout the country as the party had postponed the main programme to April 14.
PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari along with Ms Faryal Talpur, chairperson of PPP women’s wing, visited Bhuttos’ mausoleum in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Bhutto on Thursday.
Accompanied by PPP Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, ministers Aijaz Jakhrani, Nasir Shah, Zulfikar Ali Shah, Gul Muhammed Jakhrani and other party leaders, they spread flowers on the graves of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto, Begum Nusrat Bhutto, 
Mir Murtaza Bhutto and Mir Shahnawaz Bhutto and offered fateha.
Khuhro said in a press statement that Bhutto’s ‘judicial murder’ was a ‘black chapter’ in the country’s history though Supreme Court had tried to remove the stain from the judiciary’s record with its verdict. 
After the court’s admission that Bhutto was denied opportunity of a ‘fair trial’ he (Bhutto) should be declared a national hero, he said. 
In Karachi, Quran khawni was held at the party’s city headquarters, People’s Secretariat, which was attended by a large number of party workers. Senior PPP leaders Senator Waqar Mehdi, Sindh minister Saeed Ghani, MNA Shahhida Rahmani and several other leaders and legislators attended the programme and offered prayers for the founding chairman of their party.

They were sharing views at the moot organised by the Hari Welfare Association, an NGO, to mark inauguration of a women peasant literary centre in Matiari, said a press release the other day. It was one of 12 basic literacy centres the association had set up for peasant women in Shaheed Benazirabad, Sanghar and Matiari districts.
HWA president Akram Khaskheli said that a significant number of rural women faced challenges in understanding medicines’ expiry dates, lacked literacy skills to read and write, struggled to lodge complaints through online platforms and faced difficulties in reading signboards among other limitations.
He said that one of the major reason for debt bondage was that peasants, including women, did not know how much loan they had taken from contractors, landlords or brick kiln owners whereas the lenders continued to inflate the actual loan amount paid to them.
He said 600 rural peasant women, who were members of trade unions in those districts were enrolled; they would be provided basic education and awareness of social, economic and political rights. 
He said that in a four-month literacy course, participants would have a context-specific curriculum including literacy (Sindhi and English), numeracy and essential life skills under supervision of Female Community Teachers. Ms Yasmeen Tariq, social organiser, also spoke.

12,Sindh starts getting more water than its share,"Irsa agrees to increase supply from 35,000 to 41,000 cusecs."," 

HYDERABAD: A view of the parched Indus riverbed, downstream of Kotri Barrage, on Thursday. Although flows are expected to improve after the Indus River System Authority agreed to release more water for Sindh, there are still fears a severe water shortage may be in the making.—Umair Ali

HYDERABAD: The Indus River System Authority (Irsa) on Thursday accepted Sindh’s request for release of water to the province over and above its share from April 6.
Irsa’s decision is the outcome of its Sindh member Mohammad Ehsanul Haq Leghari’s recent move to take up the issue of increasing values of TDS (total dissolved solids) in Indus water at Kotri Barrage.
The constantly rising TDS values had turned water in Hyderabad’s vital reservoirs unfit for human consumption, according to lab tests performed in the last week of March.
Irsa’s spokesman Khalid Idris Rana told Dawn on Thursday that Sindh had first placed an indent (demand for flows) as per its share i.e. 35,000 cusecs and then a fresh indent of 41,000 cusecs was submitted. “Irsa has agreed to release 41,000 cusecs, which is over and above Sindh’s share, for the current month from Saturday (April 6),” he said.
 
 

A few thousand cusecs of additional water supplies for Sindh would be released from Panjnad downstream within the next 48 hours, he said on Thursday, adding that when the 41,000 cusecs of flows would enter Sindh, the ‘second 10 daily’ of April would have started.

Irsa agrees to increase supply from 35,000 to 41,000 cusecs

Mr Leghari said he had submitted the request to Irsa so that drinking water needs of cities could be met.
He said the additional supplies would help meet irrigation requirement as well.
He said Irsa was told that if there would be over and above the allocation of indent, then it could be adjusted later. He told Dawn that this 6,000 cusecs of water would be adjusted later on; when there would be surplus water in monsoon season in Sindh.
Wasa resumes lifting water from Indus
With the release of flows downstream Kotri and Sukkur barrages, the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) on Wednesday started lifting water from Indus to fill its lagoons, meant for drinking water supply to consumers in Hyderabad, according to the agency’s Managing Director Zishan Malik.
He said Indus discharges at Sukkur downstream had now increased and simultaneously a few hundred cusecs were released downstream Kotri Barrage — Wasa’s principal source of drinking water supply.
Sukkur Barrage downstream discharge was recorded at 6,200 cusecs on March 29 which dropped to below 6,000 on the next couple of days.
Wasa raised the issue at relevant forums with evidence of increasing TDS values in its reservoirs coupled with discharges of Manchhar lake’s toxic waters into Indus. Accordingly, the Sindh irrigation authorities increased discharges downstream Sukkur as Wasa had to stop lifting water from Indus a few days back due to its deteriorating quality.
Wasa had also informed the authorities concerned that it was left with a water storage sufficient only for two-three days.
On Wednesday (April 3), discharges from downstream Sukkur Barrage increased to 7,550 cusecs and on the following day the same volume of discharge was recorded. These flows would take about a week’s time to reach Kotri.
Life-threatening contamination
Wasa raises SOS whenever Indus water quality gets deteriorated due to abnormal values of TDS or other parameters in view of the May 2004 situation, which had caused close to 50 deaths in Hyderabad and its adjoining districts.
The casualties were attributed to consumption of Indus water having been mixed with toxic water discharges from Manchhar Lake.
In the wake of public outcry and Supreme Court intervention over the tragedy, a dilution formula —flows of Indus river and quantum of water to be released from the lake — before release of its discharges into Indus was enforced.
In the last week of March, the TDS values in Indus water, according to the laboratory reports of Wasa’s water filtration plant, had increased to 770mg/l and 875mgl, prompting the agency to stop lifting water from its sources.

13,Growers want Sindh govt to increase wheat support price,LARKANA: The Sindh Abdgar Board (SAB) has rejected wheat support price declared by the provincial government and...,"LARKANA: The Sindh Abdgar Board (SAB) has rejected wheat support price declared by the provincial government and demanded it revise the price to between Rs4,500 and Rs5,000 per 40 kilogram otherwise growers will be compelled to launch province-wide protest after Eid. 
SAB Larkana district president Irfan Jatoi and Zuhaib Rehman said at a press conference at Larkana Press Club on Thursday that not only the support price was dismally low but the government had also not yet established procurement centres in the province to buy the grain.
They said the prices of agriculture inputs like urea, DAP, petrol and diesel had multiplied while the growers had invested huge money in addition to bank loans to have a good crop. “We have achieved bumper crop but low procurement price and traders’ monopoly have discouraged us as we cannot afford to sell wheat at Rs4,000 per 40 kg to government,” they said.
They said that instead of transferring benefits to growers the government had imported 3.2 million tonnes of poor quality wheat at the rate of Rs7,000 per 40 kg. It was quite unfortunate that growers with bumper crop in hand were looking to the government to provide them gunny bags to sell their yield though procurement centres, they said. 
They said that in the absence of satisfactory measures the traders were buying wheat in open markets at as low a price as Rs3,200 to Rs3,300 per 40 kg from growers. The traders would later sell the wheat at higher rate in connivance with food department, they said. 
They feared the nexus between traders and food department would damage growers’ interests. The 70 to 80 per cent population of Sindh, which was linked with agriculture, would come under great stress as they would have to clear heavy loans they had obtained on high interest rates in case they did not get fair price for their produce, they said. 
They said that SAB representatives who attended a conference in Islamabad convened by Chief of Army Staff had drawn attention of COAS to the issue of not getting appropriate procurement prices for crops. “But despite his assurance we are not getting satisfactory rate of wheat crop,” they said.
