2,"PTA blocks 1.07m ‘objectionable’ web links, PHC informed",Court disposes of petition for blocking blasphemous content on social media.,"PESHAWAR: The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority told the Peshawar High Court on Thursday that it had blocked 1.07 million web links after finding their contents to be blasphemous or pornographic.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Syed Arshad Ali disposed of a petition of several lawyers seeking the court’s directives for the respondents, including the PTA, to block all links on social media platforms carrying blasphemous contents, which, he said, were against the injunctions of Islam.
The petitioners also called for the issuance of orders to the PTA for filtering contents before uploading on social media platforms.
Following arguments by one of the petitioners, Sara Ali Khan, lawyer for the PTA Jehanzeb Mehsud and deputy attorney general Hazrat Said, the bench pronounced a short order for disposing of the petition. Detailed judgement will be released later.
Advocate Sara Ali contended that the petitioners came to know about the issue on social media in which openly blasphemous material were available and were still circulating. She said that act was not only against the injunctions of Islam but was also against humanity.

Court disposes of petition for blocking blasphemous contents on social media

“Such acts also violate provisions of the Constitution,” she said.
The lawyer argued that the respondents, including the PTA, had the authority to regulate circulation of different contents on social media platforms.
She added that the Constitution didn’t allow circulation of any un-Islamic material on social media and the respondents should devise a mechanism for blocking such material prior to its uploading.
Advocate Jehanzeb Mehsud submitted comments on behalf of the PTA’s chairman and said out of a total of 1.109 million web links processed by the authority, 110,862 were related to blasphemy and of them, 90,976 (82.06 percent) were blocked.
He added that those links were from social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok and Daily Motion.
The lawyer said 998,334 processed links were related to pornography and of them, 988,768 (99.04 per cent) were blocked by the PTA.
He said on receipt of the petition, the PTA, based on information available in the petition, searched for the alleged blasphemous contents and took up the matter with the relevant social media platform and blocked/banned the content for viewership in the country.
When the bench asked if the PTA had any mechanism to block any content before its uploading, the lawyer said no such mechanism was available so far to filter contents before uploading it from any source.
Mr Mehsud said the PTA had established the Web Analysis Division to deal with the issues related to unlawful online content and a dedicated “wed analysis cell” was working under it.
The counsel said the division had also developed an e-portal to receive complaints from stakeholder organisations including ministries, intelligence agencies and law-enforcement agencies and these organisations had also established dedicated cyber wings in their respective departments.
He said Section 37 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act empowered the PTA to remove or block or issue directions for removal or blocking of access to an information through any information system, if it considered it necessary, in the interest of glory of Islam or the integrity, security or defence of Pakistan, public order, decency or morality.
He contended that the Removal and Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight and safeguard) Rules, 2021, provided mechanism to deal with the blocking or removal of ‘online content’ and any person or entity could file a complaint to the PTA regarding unlawful content.
The counsel said under the rules, the petitioners could approach the PTA with a complaint about any website carrying objectionable contents.

3,ANP asks lawmaker to withdraw Gandhara Corridor Bill,PESHAWAR: Awami National Party (ANP) rejected “Gandhara Corridor Bill” submitted to National Assembly by MNA Dr...,"PESHAWAR: Awami National Party (ANP) rejected “Gandhara Corridor Bill” submitted to National Assembly by MNA Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani and described it a conspiracy to deprive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of its archaeological assets.
ANP provincial spokesperson Samar Haroon Bilour said in a statement here on Thursday that more than 90 per cent sites of Gandhara civilisation in Pakistan were situated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. She said that the bill was a conspiracy to seize the relics of the existing Gandhara civilisation in KP.
“After the passage of 18th Amendment, tourism and archaeology is a provincial department. If the antiquities are in Pakhtunkhwa, the province has the authority to legislate about it,” she said.
The ANP leader said that any legislation about the Gandhara corridor would be against the 18th Amendment and provincial autonomy. Reacting to the submission of the bill by MNA Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, she said that the federation had already attacked Gandhara in the form of Gandhara Culture Authority Act, 2023, which was not acceptable to her party. 
Ms Bilour, who is also a former MPA, asked MNA Dr Ramesh Kumar to withdraw the bill immediately. She said that the same member of National Assembly was also in the forefront in establishing Gandhara Culture Authority.
The ANP spokesperson said that the lawmaker from Sindh should bring a bill regarding Harappa and Mohenjo-daro instead of KP’s historical resources. She said that Gandhara civilisation and its remains had an important role in the sources of income of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
She said that her party would not tolerate such tactics to snatch the resources of the province. “The province is already deprived of other rights including electricity and natural gas net hydel profit and NFC award. It is hoped that Chief Minister Gandapur and PTI members from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in National Assembly will raise their voice against this bill,” she added.

In the letter written, it was stated that the University of Peshawar, Agricultural university and Engineering university (greater campus), were facing financial difficulties, adding that for the last six years, the federal and provincial governments had been providing insufficient funds, which led to a crisis.
Dr Bakht stated that the payment of increased salaries and pension to employees had also created a crisis. 
He further said that the prevailing financial crunch was posing a threat to higher education and the existence of universities.
He said the secretary higher education had asked the universities to solve their financial problems by themselves as autonomous institutions. Dr Bakht pointed out that excessive recruitment at the universities had aggravated the financial problem.

5,Institute of Liver Transplant to be operational in three months,"15 free medical procedures planned every month, says CM’s focal person","PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has planned to make the Institute of Liver Transplant in the provincial capital operational in the next three months.
It has also decided that the institute being put up at the Institute of Kidney Diseases of the Hayatabad Medical Complex will carry out 15 free medical procedures every month to replace diseased livers of patients with healthy ones from donors.
“We [the government] are going to operationalise the Institute of Liver Transplant, the first of its kind in the province, for hepatic transplantation. It’ll cater for patients from Peshawar region as well as Hazara, Malakand and southern areas of our province,” the focal person for the chief minister on health Dr Amjad Ali Khan told Dawn.
He said the provincial government had already allocated more than Rs200m for the institute, which would procure goods directly from foreign manufacturers,” he said.

15 free medical procedures planned every month, says CM’s focal person

Dr Amjad, a PTI-backed MNA from Swat district, said he was tasked by Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur with overseeing health projects in the province, considering his healthcare expertise.
“I’ll ensure the projects are completed on time and the taxpayers’ money is utilised to people’s benefit,” he said.
The focal person said currently, the province didn’t have any institute for liver transplants, prompting well-off residents to go to other provinces or abroad for hepatic transplantation, while the poor ultimately died because they were unable to afford the high cost of the procedure.
He said after the institute became functional, patients from districts other than Peshawar, too, would avail themselves of the free transplant facility there.
“We are in contact with the relevant departments and doctors to ensure that the institute becomes operational without trouble, as the chief minister wants to see people with damaged livers live a normal life in line with the PTI’s agenda of universal health coverage,” he said.
Dr Amjad said the government was also committed to the early establishment of the Institute of Bone Marrow Transplant at the Regional Blood Centre of the HMC.
“We’ve already pledged Rs300 million for the institute. There is no cure for blood issues, so patients have to rely on blood donations for survival,” he said, adding that bone marrow transplantation will give a new lease of life to the patients by ending their dependency on blood transfusion.
The focal person said hundreds of people suffering from thalaessemia underwent cashless bone marrow transplants at the institute to stay alive and work as normal people.
He said work had already been initiated on the architectural design of the institute, and an expert from his hometown, Swat, had volunteered his services for it.
“It will be an institute of international standard to be linked with national and international institutes to offer the latest health services,” he said.
Dr Amjad said the proposed Institute of Neurosciences and Orthopaedic Centre of Excellence was not only meant to provide services to the people, but it would also impart the latest knowledge and techniques to doctors, nurses, and paramedics in those specialties and spread services to other regions in the near future.
He added that all those institutes would be linked with three regions, including Hazara, Malakand, and the southern belt, whose patients would be referred to Peshawar institutes for specialised services.
“People will get services like hip and knee replacement free of charge,” he said, adding that expenses for these procedures are unaffordable for the common man.
Dr Amjad said the government was supporting those initiatives to improve patient care, as currently there was no treatment available for liver cirrhosis and thalaessemia, whose only solution was transplantation.
He said patients would get all investigations and medication free of charge.
“We [the government] will provide all required budgetary allocations to these institutes,” he said.

HEC approved campus for Oghi eight years ago

The former naib nazim said the Hazara University’s campus in Battagram was approved much later than Oghi’s campus but it had become functional.
He said if the Oghi campus was launched, students of the neighbouring Torghar district, which didn’t have any degree college, could also benefit.
Mr Yusuf warned if the demand wasn’t met, the residents would take to the streets.
STREET DOGS: Street dogs have bitten dozens of people, mostly children, in Oghi and its suburbs in recent days, said residents.
Tahir Khan Hassanzai told reporters on Thursday that despite high dog bite incidence, the tehsil municipal administration had yet to cull street dogs.
He said he took up the issue of the shortage of anti-rabies vaccine with the health departmentand culling of street dogs with the tehsil municipal administration, but to no avail.
“Many people, mostly children, are bitten by dogs in Paghal Gali and its suburbs, so children are afraid of stepping out and going to schools,” he said.
Mr Hassanzai said as the local health centres lacked anti-rabies vaccines, the people bitten by street dogs were taken to the King Abdullah Teaching Hospital, Mansehra.
Meanwhile, residents have demanded a crackdown on begging in Oghi and adjoining areas.
A group of traders led by Haq Nawaz told reporters that professional beggars both men and women from other parts of the country came to the area during Ramazan and sought alms on the streets, especially in bazaars, without let or hindrance.
He demanded strict action against beggars without delay.

14,Funds shortage hampering work on Tanda Dam,"KOHAT: Work on raising dyke of Tanda Dam for restoration of its 76,000 acre-feet original storage capacity scheduled...","KOHAT: Work on raising dyke of Tanda Dam for restoration of its 76,000 acre-feet original storage capacity scheduled for completion in June 2024 has hit snags owing to shortage of funds.
The hydraulic iron gate of the dam is also being remodeled. When the gate is opened upwards, the lake water is released into the irrigation canal. It is also a popular lake-view and wildlife park.
The hot picnic spot is the spillway of the dam through which water gushes out into the canal spreading vapors along with fish. Local children, who are experts in swimming, dive from above the spillway into the canal for catching fish that are sold to visitors.
It is a historical dam that was inaugurated by former president Ayub Khan in 1962 but became functional in 1967. The project had been started at Rs2.5 billion in 2022 but now it could take more than a year for completion if the funds are released on time.
The sub-divisional officer of the irrigation department, Sultan, told this scribe that the Rs1200 million cost escalation was also a major impediment factor but the contractor was cooperating with them and continuing the work.
He said that the water could not reach the tail ends after exhausting its pressure on the way which had been caused by the pileup of dreg in the dam. He said that the water was being released in the under-construction canal when needed by the farmers which did not damage it but strengthened the concrete structure.
He informed that the irrigation canal had been increased to 87 kilometres from 84 kilometres including subsidiaries adding 3.2 kilometres which would benefit 135,000 farmers.
At the time of its inauguration, it had a storage capacity in the en-catchment area of 76,000 acre feet which had come down to only 40,000 acre feet due to silt accumulated during the last 56 years.
KILLED: A young employee of a local bank was killed in Mohallah Mianbadshah on Wednesday night over a petty dispute.
Mohammad Ali and his father Mohammad Shoeb have been nominated in the FIR by Firdous Bibi, the mother of 28-year-old victim Akash.

The development came during a meeting between JUI-F leaders and elders of the former governor’s family, according to the spokesman for the JUI-F’s local chapter.
In the meeting, the JUI-F was represented by Maulana Abdur Rasheed, Khar tehsil council chairman Haji Said Badshah, and Mohammad Imran Mahir. 
The meeting was attended by JUI-F leaders Maulana Abdur Rasheed, Haji Said Badshah and Mohammad Imran Mahir, Engineer Shaukatullah’s elder son Najeebullah Khan, and other family members.
They decided that Maulana Abdur Rasheed would withdraw her candidacy from NA-8 in favour of Engineer Shaukatullah and Najeebullah Khan, the elder son of the former governor, from PK-22 in support of Mohammad Imran Mahir, the JUI-F-backed independent candidate.
The JUI-F workers and supporters will vote for Engineer Shaukatullah, while Engineer Shaukatullah’s influential family will support Mohammad Imran Mahir in the April 21 by-polls.
Engineer Shaukatullah’s family confirmed the development in a statement, saying the seat adjustment is part of the strategies of both sides to claim electoral victories.
Sources in the JUI-F said Imran Mahir, who was the party’s candidate in the February 8 general elections, was taking part in the April 21 electoral exercise as an independent contestant after JUI-F chief Maulana Fazl Rehman announced the boycott of the April 21 by-polls.

17,Foreign tourist lauds KP people’s hospitality,Michael Johnson says visit to Peshawar changed his perception about the city,"PESHAWAR: A foreign tourist, Michael Johnson, has termed people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa peace loving, hospitable and opened-minded.
After a recent trip to different parts of the provincial metropolis, he shared his views with a group of local rights activists, saying that close interaction with Peshawarites shattered the image portrayed in the media as he witnessed the real situation on ground.
The London-based Australian tourist said he was happy to experience the sights and sounds of the city of which he had a terrible image. 
He said that close interaction with locals including rights activists, educationists and artists helped him explore the real image of the people craving for peace, hospitality and a pluralistic approach towards life.

Michael Johnson says visit to Peshawar changed his perception about the city

“Life is abuzz with a broad perspective laden with welcoming passion towards guests and tourists. It really made me wonderstruck as it was exactly opposite to the image being portrayed in the international. Amid all whims and fears, I was determined to visit Peshawar city, its dwellers and witness its real face. Not only I saw it I also enjoyed it while interacting with this beautiful face,” said Johnson.
He said that all cafés and restaurants in the city remained close owing to fasting month but locals opened their hearts and offered him a luncheon, showcasing their traditional hospitality and due regard for guests.
“It reminded me of a quote by Gandhi Ji, who had travelled to Parachinar tribal district in pre-partition India during the fasting month and local people still presented traditional luncheon to their honourable guest. I saw here girls are going to schools, even transgender community is given respect while Christian, Sikh and Hindu communities are living together in the same city,” said the tourist.
Mr Johnson also visited the office of Mafkoora, a local organisation, and met its chief executive Hayat Roghani and other workers. “I did not expect a place like this in Peshawar where young volunteers work for promotion of peace and cultural diversity. I was really surprised,” he said.
Prof Samiuddin Arman, executive member of Mafkoora, also gifted a fresh monthly edition of a Pashto magazine for children ‘Rana Barn’ and a copy of Bacha Khan’s profile to the guest. Later, he was given a trip to different parts of Mafkoora, city’s heritage sites and bazaars.
“My visit would remain alive in my memories for long as it helped me to explore the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, their hospitality drenched in respect, love and passion for diversity,” said Mr Johnson.
