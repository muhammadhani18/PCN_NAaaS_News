PTI leader Raoof Hasan said that it was not correct that the public meeting was called off.
“We have decided to extend the date because of the last Ashra of Ramazan as people would be busy in prayers during these days. We will announce the fresh date for the public meeting after Ramazan,” he said.
After Feb 8 polls, PTI announced to hold countrywide protests and public meetings against the alleged rigging. 
The protests had to be started from Islamabad. Party had submitted application with the district administration on March 14 and then a reminder was submitted on March 18 seeking permit to hold public meeting at Parade Ground Shakarparian, or D-Chowk, or F-9 Park, on March 23 or March 30.
After failing to get any response from district administration PTI approached IHC. The court directed the district administration to respond to the application.
The district administration stated that section 144 Cr.PC. had been imposed on all kinds of public gatherings in federal capital. 
Moreover, it informed that after seeking input from Intelligence Bureau, 
Special Branch and Islamabad Police, it was decided that approval could not be given for ‘security reasons ’ and non-availability of security personnel.
Party was also informed that it violated its affidavits and promises in the past.
Later PTI again contacted IHC due to which Chief Justice Aamer Farooq allowed PTI to hold meeting in Islamabad, observing that peaceful gathering was a constitutional right which cannot be denied for technicalities.
He directed the district administration to impose reasonable conditions for holding the public gathering.
However the counsel for the government argued that due to security threats attack in which Chinese engineers were killed. He pointed out that PTI violated the undertaking of holding peaceful gatherings earlier.
Justice Farooq termed the terrorist attack unfortunate but remarked that the constitutional right could not be denied due to such activities since Pakistan needed to eliminate the menace through collective efforts. 
He directed the district administration to issue the no objection certificate (NOC) for the gathering and also advised the PTI’s counsel to ensure the procession remained peaceful.
The party was allowed to hold public meeting on April 6 but now it may require another NOC for holding the public meeting after Ramazan.

1,Row over powers leaves Islamabad police department in a fix,"Capital police without their chief for almost a week; commissioner tells them to approach. 
interior secretary for acting IG’s","ISLAMABAD: The office of the Islamabad police has been lying vacant for almost a week due to a tussle between the district administration, the interior ministry with the police over the Police Order 2002 brought into force by ex-IGP Akbar Nasir Khan in 2022.
The Police Order proclaimed by the ex-IG empowered the police chief and placed the capital police under the interior ministry instead of the capital administration.
This resulted in an ongoing rift between the three departments, with the interior ministry voiding multiple promotions approved by the then-IGP. This eventually resulted in two major groups: the police chief on one side, and the capital admin and the ministry on the other.
The ex-IGP Islamabad promulgated the Police Order 2002 in 2022, but it is yet to be approved by parliament and the president. The authorities concerned did not issue a notification either. Before the promulgation of the Police Order, the capital police worked under Police Rules.

Capital police without their chief for almost a week; commissioner tells them to approach interior secretary for acting IG’s notification

The recent departure of Dr Akbar Nasir has renewed this power struggle between the police and the commissioner’s office. The outgoing police chief was bid farewell in a ceremony on Saturday. The ceremony was also supposed to welcome the new chief but due to unknown reasons, the Lahore DIG operations did not take charge.
According to the Esta Code (Civil Establishment Code) and Rules of Business 1973, the IGP could have appointed the senior-most officer to look after the top post for 90 days or till the appointment of a regular police chief. Since the IGP failed to appoint his stopgap replacement and the new police chief appeared reluctant to take charge, the most senior officer of the capital police will look after the office of the IGP as per the aforementioned rules.
The Police Rules in vogue before the promulgation of the police order by the former IGP had empowered the commissioner to notify the appointment of a temporary police head, but since the Police Order is in the field, the commissioner has excused himself from exercising the powers he had under the police rules.
After the police approached the commissioner to notify the acting IGP, he told them to approach the interior secretary as the Police Order had empowered the latter for the job.
After the commissioner snub, the police have yet to approach the ministry for a stopgap arrangement.
However, the senior most DIGs — two from 29 CPT and one from 30 CPT — are yet to obey the Esta Code and the Rules of Business 1973 which say that the senior most officer will automatically become the acting IGP in case the office remains vacant.
On the other hand, a 19-grade officer Shahzad Nadeem Bukhari, who is working at a grade-20 post of DIG Operations, is using the powers of the IGP as well as the power that had been taken away from him by ex-IGP Dr Akbar Nasir Khan.
Recently, the three senior officers — DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza, DIG Security Owais Ahmed, and Safe City head DIG Mohammad Shoaib — had approached the commissioner for a 15-day leave because they did not want to ‘salute’ a junior officer, DIG Operations from CTP-31, of the Lahore police, who was named the new police chief. The request for the leave was turned down and the application was returned to the DIGs.
The commissioner’s office asked them to approach the interior secretary to seek leave, saying the commissioner lost its powers to the interior secretary after the promulgation of the Police Order. After the leave request was rejected, the DIGs resumed their duties.
It may be noted that the police officers had approached the administration for a 15-day leave after the approval of their five-day leave by the outgoing police chief. The IGP can only approve a leave of up to five days.
Police spokesperson Taqi Jawad told Dawn that the IGP was still vacant and the leave request of the three DIGs had also been turned down.
He did not comment on other queries and said he’d respond after consulting the relevant officials. However, the response was still awaited as the story went to press.

2,CDA continues with blanket ban on plots transfer despite IHC ruling,ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has yet to implement an Islamabad High Court (IHC) order about ...,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has yet to implement an Islamabad High Court (IHC) order about the issuance of a No Demand Certificate (NDC) –a pre-requisite for allotment of plots.
The CDA through a letter dated January 17, 2024, had banned the issuance of NDC for further allotment of residential plots, which were allotted from July 2021 to September 2023 until clearance from the inquiry being conducted by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). Last year, the FIA started a probe against alleged fraudulent allotments during the said period.
However, the CDA banned the NDC for all allotment of plots, without any distinction of legitimate and alleged bogus plots, putting many citizens in trouble. During the said period, the CDA allotted hundreds of plots, which were further sold in markets and second and third buyers are now suffering.
“This is the right of the CDA to stop further allotment of any plot, which was initially allotted through illegal way, but a blanket ban on all plots is not justified,” said an official.
The issue was also reached in Islamabad High Court by some people and the court directed the CDA to give relief to petitioners. IHC Justice Babar Sattar also set aside the said orders dated January 17. In his order, Justice Sattar said: “ In terms of rights to property, it is settled proposition that a purchaser step into the shoes of the seller and doesn’t inherit a title better than that of the seller.”
Then CDA moved an intra-court appeal, but that was also rejected. Despite the said court orders, the CDA has yet to start the operation of issuing NDCs.
A CDA official in a detailed response to Dawn’s question said that the civic agency would start issuing NDCs “soon”.
“After completing some formalities in the coming days, we will start issuing NDCs,” he said and added that the CDA had issued the said notification in January as it was apprehensive that it might become a party to any illegality regarding the transfer of the plots. The officer said that the CDA also took this plea before the IHC. “Anyhow, now this issue is going to be settled as soon we will finalise our working,” he said.
The NDC is a pre-requisite for the transfer of plots from one party to another and if an NDC is not issued, it means that the transfer will not take place.
Separately, the sources said that FIA also expedited its probe against the CDA officials and two FIRs had already been registered a few months ago regarding 62 plots of Sector I-15 as the CDA had held balloting for these plots, but they were not allotted. The second FIR was related to the allotment of 11 plots. The FIA had arrested several CDA officials, who later secured bail.

3,No major event held in twin cities on Bhutto’s death anniversary,Only few party workers gathered at old Phaansi Ghaat; speakers pay tributes to Bhutto at Szabist seminar,"RAWALPINDI: For the second consecutive year, the Rawalpindi Chapter of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) did not arrange any major event to mark the death anniversary of the party’s founding chairman and former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as only a few party workers gathered at the old Phaansi Ghaat, the site of his hanging, to pay homage to their leader.  
Similarly, the Islamabad chapter of the party also did not hold any major event to mark the day, except a seminar organised by the Shaheed Bhutto Foundation (SBF) at Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology (Szabist) where speakers paid glowing tributes to the former prime minister and lauded his services and sacrifices for the cause of democracy in the country.
A PPP leader from Rawalpindi Nasir Mir, when contacted, said that the party did not arrange any big gathering due to Ramazan. He, however, said that small gatherings for Quran Khawani for late Bhutto were held in different places in the city.
Those who visited the site of old Phaansi Ghaat included information secretary Muhammad Shahid, Malik Tanveer Ahmed, Mian Haroon Qureshi, Chaudhry Faheem Waqar, Fazl Haq Khan and Raja Zaheer Janjua.

Only few party workers gathered at old Phaansi Ghaat; speakers pay tributes to Bhutto at Szabist seminar

Previously, the party office-bearers, including some central leaders, traditionally used to gather at the site of the old jail in Rawalpindi, where Mr Bhutto was hanged on April 4, 1979, to pay homage to their leader, deliver speeches and also distribute food among the people. However, there had been no such activity at the venue for the second consecutive year. Last year too, the party had not arranged any event due to Ramazan.   
It was during the second tenure of Benazir Bhutto’s government that the district jail site was converted into a park and Phaansi Ghaat became a place for the PPP workers and supporters to arrange special events on the the Bhutto’s death anniversary.
Talking to Dawn on condition of anonymity, a local PPP leader presented a grim scenario, stating that Ramazan was just an excuse for the leadership as the party had been fast losing the ground in the city and there had been lack of enthusiasm among the party workers, generally called Jiyalas, for the past many years.
The PPP has already announced to hold the main event to mark the Bhutto’s death anniversary at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh on April 14 due to the holy month of Ramazan.
Meanwhile, speaking at the seminar organised by the SBF in Islamabad, the participants engaged in insightful discussions, highlighting the significant contributions of the late leader to the nation’s political landscape and his unwavering dedication to democracy, social justice and progress.
The speakers paid homage to the Bhutto’s remarkable leadership, acknowledging his pivotal role in shaping Pakistan’s history and inspiring generations of leaders and activists.
President of the PPP’s Human Rights Cell and former senator Farhatullah Babar said the recent awakening of judiciary had provided a historic opportunity to political parties to take the bull by the horns in securing freedom of politics, parliament, judiciary and media from the invisible forces in a hybrid model of governance.
He said the historic March 6 ruling after 44 years of the “murder” of Shaheed Bhutto and the letter by six high court judges marked not only an attempt to jettison its past but also a course correction by the judiciary.
It is also an opportunity to politicians, generals, media and the people to correct their course, he added.
He said from political parties awarding Senate tickets to independents wired to mysterious backers, formalising the hybrid through bodies like SIFC and not investigating the mysterious attempt to amend the IRSA ordinance and thus change the Indus delta landscape it appeared that political parties had yet to undertake any meaningful course correction.
He was of the view that as long as the parliament, political parties, media and judges were amenable to manipulation and as long as the people were not the real sovereigns there would be no real democracy and no real freedom in the country.
Another speaker Zafarullah Khan said: “On this solemn occasion, we honour Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s legacy by rededicating ourselves to the ideals of democracy and social justice for which he fought tirelessly.”
Former KP governor Barrister Masood Kausar, former ECP secretary Kanwar Dilshad, Nargis Faiz Malik, Prof Tahir Malik and head of the SBF Asif Khan also addressed the seminar.

They passed the resolution during a seminar organised by Potohar Organisation for Development Advocacy (PODA) with the collaboration of the University of Chakwal in connection with World Health Day.
Presenting the resolution to around 200 participants, including students, faculty members, senior district administration officers of various university departments, lawyers, social activists, community leaders, and media persons, Chief Executive Officer PODA Sameena Nazir urged the government that, for granting the right to health, there was a dire need to introduce a constitutional amendment.
Terming health as a fundamental human right, she explained that most countries in the world made the right to health for their citizens a constitutional right; however, unlike 115 countries in the world, the Constitution of Pakistan does not explicitly recognise the right to health.
In 1948, countries around the world came together and founded the World Health Organisation (WHO) to promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable so everyone, everywhere, could attain the highest level of health and well-being. The First World Health Assembly decided to celebrate World Health Day on April 7 of each year, with effect from 1950.
PODA, in collaboration with the University of Chakwal, jointly celebrated World Health Day here in the university auditorium titled “Promoting and Protecting Women and Girls’ Health, Challenges and a Way Forward,” organised under the project “Reduce Early Marriages to Enhance Gender Equality,” funded by the Royal Norwegian Embassy, Islamabad.
According to a statement issued from Islamabad highlighting the importance of a healthy diet for attaining proper nutrition, Vice Chancellor University of Chakwal Dr. Mohammad Bilal Khan, said there was a need to promote local products.
Appreciating PODA and the management of the University of Chakwal, Assistant Commissioner Ms. Sameena Bashir said, “healthy women guarantee a healthy society.”.
CEO of the Education Department of Chakwal, Abdul Waheed, said: “Unlike other countries, we don’t pay much attention to the subject of health in the curriculum. We need to ensure holistic education for our future generations, including elements of physical, mental, and emotional health for their development in text books. We need to address subjects related to health at the school level, as it has become a reality since COVID-19.”
Another speaker, Dr Faiza Akhter, said that malnourished females can manage their lifestyle adaptation in diet through portion control by adding five major groups of foods such as carbohydrates (roti, rice, pasta, noodles), protein fat (meat, lentils), fat (healthy fat, olive oil, coco oil), folic acid, and zinc supplements. “By lifestyle modification, a diet plan, and healthy exercises, females can manage malnutrition issues,” she added.

A statement issued here said that the project was announced on Aug 31, 2021 with the original cost of $22.76 million.
The notes for the additional grant were signed and exchanged between Wada Mitsuhiro, Ambassador of Japan and Dr Kazim Niaz, Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs on Thursday.
On the same occasion, amended grant agreements of the project were signed and exchanged Thursday between Naoaki Miyata, who is Chief Representative of JICA Pakistan Office and Saeed Ashraf Siddiqui, Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Under this project, a new maternal and child health center would be established at the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS), Jamshoro, which was a public medical institution serving as the regional hub hospital in Hyderabad district.
The maternal and child health center would have departments of obstetrics and pediatrics, including a labour room, an obstetrics ward, a neonatal intensive care unit, a maternal and fetal intensive care unit, a laboratory, and outpatient consultation rooms.
In addition, around 120 items of medical equipment including newborn incubators and ultrasonic diagnostic device were to be installed. The project was scheduled to be completed by April 2025.
Ambassador Wada said, “The project is expected to benefit more than 20 million people. In terms of the project amount $27.19 million and beneficiary population, this is one of the largest grant projects implemented by Japan in countries around the world.
“I am confident that upon completion in April 2025, this project will be one of the symbols of Japan’s development assistance to Pakistan, along with the Pims in Islamabad.”
The statement issued here by the Japanese embassy said that the number of care facilities to treat mothers and babies with complications was limited in Sindh.
This project would not only alleviate the pressure of tertiary hospitals in Karachi and Hyderabad, but also open up opportunities for families from all over southern part of Sindh, with improved accessibility and better chances of saving lives.

11,Countries must learn from past environmental disasters: expert,"Aftab Alam Khan has developed climate-resilient solutions across 35 countries and advised governments in Pakistan, Indonesia, and South Africa.","ISLAMABAD: Capacity issues at all levels and a lack of coordination among the stakeholders were two of the key reasons that developing countries, including Pakistan, will counter the effects of climate change and mitigate losses caused by it.
Aftab Alam Khan, an award-winning climate change expert, said while talking to the media on Thursday that developing countries need to learn from the past for the future, adding, “The concept of lessons learned is almost non-existent, mainly related to environmental disasters and the effects of climate change.”
Mr Khan has executed an award-winning project related to hardships faced by the most vulnerable populations across 14 countries due to soaring inflation in essential commodities such as food, fertilizer, water, and petroleum products. He has developed climate-resilient solutions across 35 countries and has advised governments in Pakistan, Indonesia, and South Africa.
Mr Khan has also contributed to integrating climate change into university curricula and informed the media that the impact of climate change and environmental disasters has led to a serious crisis that has largely remained underreported.
The award-winning climate change expert is also the co-author of the report titled, “The Human Costs of the Food Crisis: How Price Spikes are Wreaking Havoc across the Globe.”
“There are two serious impacts of environmental disasters that have largely remained unreported in mainstream media, not only in Pakistan but also in other vulnerable countries: debt traps and prolonged poverty due to loss of land or a source of livelihood,” he said.
Highlighting his report, Mr Khan said that the vulnerable communities are forced to borrow money from local lenders but end up paying huge interest over a long period, whereas many are forced to sell their land or livestock only to survive the catastrophe.
The policy recommendations in the report included that the Committee on World Food Security, housed at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (UNFAO), should play a greater role in devising policy options for the alarming situation highlighted in the report.
It added that the governments should be supported by the United Nations, other international institutions, and donor countries to put in place and strengthen their social protection and public services to cushion the impact of price increases on households.
The report has suggested that since the debt stress leaves little space to finance social protection initiatives, the international community should cancel the debts of the affected countries.
The report shows that using agro-ecology has helped to make savings on crop production, which is a method to use water-efficient techniques, build soil fertility, and reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers that emit greenhouse gases.

Mr Abdula was addressing the business community at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI).
He recalled the experiences related to the first ever trade delegation visit mobilised by the Ethiopian Embassy last year in March.
“We received an overwhelming response to the first trade delegation, which I called Hijra Trip to Ethiopia, that enabled the business community of Pakistan to explore business, trade, and investment opportunities in Ethiopia,” the ambassador noted.
He stated that more than 75 businessmen participated in the first trade delegation to Ethiopia and got an opportunity not only to directly communicate with the high-level government officials but also businessmen from the major sectors.
“I would like to urge every businessman in Pakistan to become part of our Hijra Trip II and contribute to the efforts of the Ethiopian Embassy in establishing strong trade relations and partnerships between the two countries,” the ambassador stressed.
During the meeting, the ambassador also highlighted the extraordinary trade and investment opportunities offered by the home-grown economy of Ethiopia in diverse economic sectors, including agriculture and agro-processing, manufacturing, mining, ICT, and tourism.
He said Ethiopia was producing cheap, clean, sustainable, and affordable energy, exporting it to its neighboring countries, including Kenya, Djibouti, Sudan, and others. Likewise, multiple incentives, including one-window operations, were introduced to facilitate foreign direct investment in Ethiopia.
Mr Abdula further noted that Pakistan also offered immense trade and investment opportunities to the business community of Ethiopia, especially in the areas of manufacturing, agriculture, fertilizer, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, surgical equipment, textiles, automotive, and others.
Speaking on the occasion, FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh appreciated the socio-economic development in Ethiopia during the recent past, especially under the leadership of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.
He expressed complete support for the Embassy of Ethiopia in Islamabad for mobilising the trade delegation being planned for May-end.
The FPCCI President vowed to be part of the delegation, along with a number of businessmen who were part of the federal trade body as well as regional ones, to explore and harness opportunities available in Ethiopia and Africa.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, he said out of Pakistan’s 240 million population 70 per cent were young people. Among them, those under 30 years made up 170 million of the population. This youth bulge needed to be guided in the right direction and provided with a platform to engage in positive activities.
He emphasised the importance of instilling confidence in the youth, assuring them that hard work would be rewarded based on merit whether in education, sports, technology or skill development. Mr Mashhood highlighted the focus on youth empowerment during Shehbaz Sharif’s tenure as the chief minister of Punjab.
Initiatives such as the laptop scheme, Punjab Education Endowment Fund, scholarships, skill development programmes, and quality education initiatives were launched under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif.
He announced plans to expand the youth loan programme and increase the IT industry’s growth from 15 per cent to 25 per cent in coming years.
He said initiatives like e-employment and Daanish schools introduced during the Shehbaz Sharif’s tenure as chief minister of Punjab would be expanded to Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir, Balochistan and Sindh under the Daanish Authority.
The aim is to empower Pakistani youth through investment programmes in IT skill training courses and other initiatives. Efforts were also underway to provide dignified employment opportunities locally and internationally through modern skill development courses for the youth, he claimed.
Mr Mashhood stressed the importance of e-gaming in the digital era, highlighting its potential as a billion-dollar industry and acknowledging the achievements of Pakistani youth in this field. The youth festival in Punjab showcased the talent and capabilities of young individuals in sports.
The Prime Minister’s Youth Talent Hunt Programme was initiated to nurture talent across 12 sports disciplines. Promising athletes identified through talent hunt leagues and national games would receive training in collaboration with Olympic Associations to participate in international sports events.
To promote Pakistan’s culture, support would be provided for local art and craft to gain recognition both nationally and internationally. He said the tourism sector was being focused on as an industry that could potentially generate $10 billion to $15 billion annually. 
An official also claimed that projects were underway to enhance tourism experiences, including launching tourist double-decker buses on scenic routes in Islamabad to showcase Pakistan’s civilisation and culture to visitors from around the world.
