0,Sabalenka earns Swiatek revenge to win Madrid title,MADRID: World number two Aryna Sabalenka played a superb attacking game to beat Iga Swiatek in the Madrid Open final...,"MADRID: World number two Aryna Sabalenka played a superb attacking game to beat Iga Swiatek in the Madrid Open final on Satu­rday for her first win on clay against her top-ranked rival.
The Belarusian prevailed 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 to capture the title in the Spanish capital for the second time.
Until Saturday, the 25-year-old had lost all of her three previous meetings with the Pole on clay without even winning a set.
“It’s something unbelievable. I’m really happy that I’m able to fight against her and I’m able to get this win so it’s not like so super boring for people to watch our matches,” said the champion.
“I really enjoy playing on clay, because I have extra time. It’s not super fast, so I can go for my powerful shots. There are longer rallies. It’s like not just bomb, bomb.”
The big-hitting Belarusian gained revenge for defeat by her Polish rival in the Stuttgart final a fortnight ago with a thrilling triumph to end Swiatek’s nine-match winning streak ahead of her French Open defence.
Swiatek fought her way back into the match after an explosive start by Sabalenka, but the second seed came back strongly in the third set to win the first WTA 1000 final featuring the top two ranked players since 2014.
Sabalenka earned her 13th career title, and only her second on clay in two hours and 25 minutes, clinching victory on her fourth championship point with a forehand cross-court winner.

DORTMUND: Borussia Dortm­und demolished hapless VfL Wolfsburg 6-0 on Sunday, with two goals apiece from Karim Adeyemi and Jude Bellingham, to stay hot on the heels of Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich with three games left in the season.
The Ruhr valley club fired three goals past the Wolves in the first half to take the wind out of their sails and added three more after the break in a one-sided game which Wolfsburg littered with defensive errors.
Dortmund are now on 64 points, one behind Bayern, 2-1 winners against Werder Bremen on Saturday. 
In front of a sold-out crowd of more than 81,000, the hosts went in front after 14 minutes with Adeyemi rising high to head in his fifth goal of the season.
The Wolves should have levelled in the 20th minute when Patrick Wimmer had only keeper Gregor Kobel to beat but his shot was blocked and Jonas Wind missed the target with his rebound.
Instead it was Dortmund who struck again in the 28th when Adeyemi delivered a pin-point assist for Sebastien Haller to tap in.
Donyell Malen did the same from a Julian Brandt assist in the 37th and after the break the hosts picked up where they had left off with Bellingham seeing his shot initially blocked by keeper Koen Casteels before the ball bounced off the bar and rolled in.
Wolfsburg’s disastrous defending continued, with another wrong pass allowing Adeyemi to slip in and make it 5-0 in the 59th. The Germany international could have earned his first Bundesliga hat-trick but he thundered a 65th-minute penalty over the bar.
Bellingham put an end to Wolfsburg’s ordeal in the 86th.
On Saturday, Serge Gnabry scored his second goal in two games to help Bayern record a win over Bremen, moving his side a step  closer to an 11th successive Bundesliga title.
Bayern toiled in the first half and were lucky not to concede  when Christian Gross fired a shot inches over the bar on 35 minutes.
Sadio  Mane came close to putting the champions ahead after the break, but it  wasn’t until just after the hour mark that Gnabry broke the deadlock.
Pouncing on a loose ball in the penalty area, the Germany international slotted the ball past Jiri Pavlenka in the Bremen goal.
Leroy  Sane added a second from the bench ten minutes later, before Niklas  Schmidt pulled a goal back with a spectacular long-range effort.
But that wasn’t enough for Bremen to avoid a 13th straight home defeat to Bayern, in a run stretching back to 2009.
Earlier on Saturday,  a late goal from Kevin Kampl put RB Leipzig back on course for the  Champions League spots with a 1-0 win over fellow top-four hopefuls  Freiburg.
Kampl’s dainty chip on 73 minutes gave his side a 1-0  win in an otherwise stagnant game in Freiburg, just days after Leipzig  had won a DFB Pokal semi-final in the same stadium.
The win lifted Marco Rose’s side to third, leapfrogging both Union Berlin and Freiburg in the race for the Champions League.
Union remained in the top four despite slipping to a 1-0 defeat away to Augsburg.
Dion  Beljo’s neat first-time finish early in the second half was enough for  Augsburg, who have still never lost to Union at home.
The win moved Augsburg closer to safety. Enrico Maassen’s side are now six points clear of the bottom three.
Hertha Berlin and Hoffenheim also landed crucial victories in the relegation fight.
Bottom side Hertha kept their slim hopes of survival alive with a tense 2-1 win against fellow strugglers Stuttgart.
Former  Stuttgart player Marc Oliver Kempf put Hertha into the lead on half an  hour, climbing high in the box to meet a Marco Richter cross.
Serhou  Guirassy levelled for Stuttgart with a tap-in, but Hertha restored the  lead through Florian Niederlechner in first-half stoppage time.
Meanwhile, Hoffenheim pulled four points clear of danger with an eventful 3-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt.
Frankfurt  reached the DFB Pokal final with a dramatic comeback against Stuttgart  in midweek, but their sluggish league form continued in a miserable  first half against Hoffenheim.
Christoph Baumgartner headed  Hoffenheim in front on eight minutes and was later brought down in the  box, allowing Andrej Kramaric to double the lead from the penalty spot.
Ihlas  Bebou made it three from close range on the stroke of half time, before  Mario Goetze netted a consolation goal for the visitors in the second  half.
Elsewhere, Boc­hum slipped back into the bottom two after  they lost 2-0 at Borussia Moenche­ngladbach. Jonas Hofmann and Lars  Stindl scored for the home team.

3,"Milan speeds to Giro triumph, Evenepoel retains lead",SAN SALVO: Italy’s Jonathan Milan of Bahrain Victorious claimed his first Grand Tour stage win at the Giro...,"SAN SALVO: Italy’s Jonathan Milan of Bahrain Victorious claimed his first Grand Tour stage win at the Giro d’Italia on Sunday after powering through to the finish line in the final sprint of stage two, a 202-km ride from Teramo to San Salvo. 
After Remco Evenepoel obliterated the competition in the opening time trial on Saturday, stage two was a chance for the sprinters while points were up for grabs for climbers as well. 
The route’s home strai­ght was one km long and a bunch of riders set themselves up for the sprint with Alpecin Deceu­ninck in the lead as Ramon Sinkeldam went on the final leadout to give his team mate Kaden Groves the upper hand. 
Fernando Gaviria (Movistar) and Pascal Ackermann (UAE Team Emirates) were also in the mix but Milan put his head down, emerged from behind Groves and pedalled hard in the last 100 metres to take victory after nearly five hours of cycling. David Dekker of Arkea-Samsic was second while Groves had to settle for third place. 
With less than four km to go, there was a crash in the bunch when the road narrowed with Mark Cave­ndish of Astana-Qazaqstan among the riders to fall, taking out a couple of fans lining the road in the process. 
Evenepoel was at the heart of the bunch at the time but he escaped the crash to retain the leader’s maglia rosa jersey with a 22-second lead over Ineos Grenadiers rider Filippo Ganna. 
Ineos rider Tao Geogh­egan Hart of Ineos Grenadiers was the major victim of the late crash. Having started the day in fourth overall, he lost 19sec on the day.

7,Rodrygo double fires Real to Copa del Rey triumph,Real have now won all six of the trophies available to them during Ancelotti’s second reign at the club.,"SEVILLE: Rodrygo struck twice and Vinicius Jr dazzled as Real Madrid beat Osasuna 2-1 on Saturday to win their 20th Copa del Rey title and first since 2014.
Brazilian Rodrygo scored the opener after two minutes but Carlo Ancelotti’s side were pegged back when Lucas Torro equalised 13 minutes after the break.
Rodrygo, however, tapped in a loose ball in the 70th minute to claim a much needed win for Real and a confidence boost after a run of poor results as they prepare to host Manchester City in their Champions League semi-final first leg on Tuesday.
Real have now won all six of the trophies available to them during Ancelotti’s second reign at the club, after the Italian returned in  2021. Los Blancos were dominant against Osasuna courtesy of a brilliant performance by Vinicius, who was virtually unstoppable down the left channel and was involved in the build-up to both Rodrygo’s goals with superb individual runs.
Rodrygo scored the opener with a tidy finish through a forest of legs after Vinicius dribbled past several defenders on the left wing and delivered a perfect cross with the outside of his boot.
Real had almost 65 per cent of the possession and Vinicius created several opportunities but his team-mates failed to make the most of it.
“They made the difference, Vini unbalanced them and Rodrygo scored the two goals,” said Ancelotti of his Brazilian wingers.
Madrid beat both Atletico Madrid and then rivals Barcelona to reach the final  and Ancelotti said it was time to celebrate, but not too heavily ahead of the clash with City.
“This night we will celebrate, a little bit, not too much, and then we will get back to work for Tuesday.”
Rodrygo missed a sitter half an hour into the game after another Vinicius run and Osasuna almost scored on the counterattack through Abde, but a desperate Dani Carvajal managed to clear the ball off the goal line.
A little later, David Alaba hit the crossbar with a free kick and Vinicius almost scored himself with a curling shot from the edge of the box that went just wide.
Real, however, took their foot off the gas in the second half and allowed Osasuna to level with Torro finding the net with a low shot from the edge of the penalty area.
Rodrygo, however, scored the winner when he finished from close range after Vinicius’s run and cross-found Toni Kroos whose shot was deflected off a defender before ending up at the feet of Rodrygo at the far post.
“I’m really happy, we were talking about this in the week, that it was a long time since Madrid had won this competition,” Rodrygo told  Spanish television broadcaster La 1.
Osasuna departed with the taste of defeat but their heads held high.
“It’s very difficult to defend against (Vinicius) and on Tuesday I am sure City will suffer too,” said coach Arrasate.
“It’s not news that Vinicius stood out, Rodrygo scored two as well, we’re talking about two of the best players in the world.”(Real) are champions because they deserve this cup, but we’re proud of the team, and let’s try to do it again.“

8,‘Pathirana can  be Sri Lanka’s asset with reduced workload’,Dhoni says Sri Lanka should use Pathirana sporadically and only for showpiece events organised by the ICC.,"NEW DELHI: Mahendra Singh Dhoni believes Matheesha Pathir­ana could become a limited-overs asset for Sri Lanka with a light workload that does not include any Test cricket.
Operating with a slingy action, Pathirana has proved his death-overs skills in the Indian Premier League inviting comparisons with compatriot Lasith Malinga, who troubled the best batters of his time with a similar unconventional action.
The 20-year-old claimed 3-15 to set up Chennai Super Kings’ six-wicket victory on Saturday, bowling all his overs in the second half of the Mumbai Indians innings.
“I personally think he is not someone who should play a lot of red-ball cricket,” Chennai captain Dhoni said alluding to the rigour of Test cricket.
“I think he shouldn’t even get close to it. Even in white-ball cricket, he should play the 50-over version as less as possible.”
Sri Lanka should use him sporadically and only for showpiece events organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC), Dhoni said.
“Make sure he is fit and available for all ICC tournaments and he will be a great asset for Sri Lanka. Not to forget, he is a really young boy.”
Pathirana has played only one T20 International match and went unsold at the auction ahead of last year’s IPL before Chennai brought him to replace an injured Adam Milne.
The right-arm bowler played just two matches last year but has 10 wickets from seven matches this season with an economy rate of 7.60.
“I feel he will serve for a very long time for Sri Lankan cricket, but we’ll have to keep an eye on how much he bowls,” Dhoni said insisting there was more to Pathirana’s bowling than just the odd action.
“People who don’t have very clean [conventional] action, batsmen find it difficult to pick them... That is just on the action part, we are not talking about the pace that he bowls, the variations he has and the consistency he has got. All of it makes him special.”

9,Gavaskar suggests break for struggling Rohit before WTC final,NEW DELHI: Batting great Sunil Gavaskar has advised India captain Rohit Sharma to take a break from the ongoing...,"NEW DELHI: Batting great Sunil Gavaskar has advised India captain Rohit Sharma to take a break from the ongoing Indian Premier League to keep himself fit and fresh for the World Test Championship final against Australia next month.
Mumbai Indians captain Rohit fell for his 16th duck in IPL, most by any batters in the tournament’s history, in Saturday’s defeat by Chennai Super Kings and now has five runs from four innings.
The off-colour opener demoted himself to number three against Chennai but fell for his second successive duck after attempting an ill-fated scoop shot against Deepak Chahar.
Rohit will lead India’s bid for the WTC title at the Oval on June 7 and Gavaskar felt a break could do wonders to the opener’s fitness and confidence.
“I would say that Rohit should maybe take a break for the time being and keep himself fit for the World Test Championship final,” the former India captain told Star Sports channel.
“He can come back again for the last few matches, but right now [he should] take a little bit of a breather himself.”
New Zealand beat India in the final of the inaugural WTC in 2021 and Rohit would have to lead by example if they are to prevail this time around despite mounting injury woes.
India will be without pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, recovering from a back surgery, and first-choice wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant, who remains sidelined after a horrific car crash in December.
Batters KL Rahul (thigh) and Shreyas Iyer (back) have also been ruled out of the contest at the Oval with injuries.

NAPLES: Victor Osimhen shot Napoli to a 1-0 win over Fiorentina on Sunday in the newly-crowned Serie A champions’ first appearance in front of their home fans since being crowned kings of Italy for the first time in 33 years. 
Nigeria striker Osimhen lashed home from the penalty spot in the 74th minute to take his league tally to 23 just a few days after netting the goal which sealed Napoli’s third Scudetto with a record-equalling five matches to play. 
A party mood has enveloped Naples since Thursday’s draw in Udine, and on Sunday afternoon fans let off fireworks and flares in the jammed streets around the stadium named after their icon Diego Maradona on a gorgeously sunny day in southern Italy. 
Packed bars and restaurants did a roaring trade with locals and tourists alike decked out in blue as a festive but relaxed mood dominated the city. 
Before kick-off supporters put on a display of the Italian flag with the number three in honour of their title wins and hailed their heroes with loud chants of “we are the champions”. 
But once the match got underway a torpor slowly washed over the ground, not helped by two teams with nothing to play for going through the motions and Napoli creating next to nothing. 
Osimhen couldn’t even put away a penalty awarded a minute after half-time for Sofyan Amrabat’s rugby tackle on Stanislav Lobotka. 
However Serie A’s leading scorer was given a chance to redeem himself when Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s weaving dribble towards goal was stopped illegally by Nicolas Gonzalez, and this time he made no mistake. 
Fiorentina, who host FC Basel in the first leg of their Europa Conference League semi-final on Thursday, remain eighth on 46 points, 12 points behind AS Roma in seventh and Atalanta in sixth with four games left in the season. 
JUVE UP TO SECOND 
Earlier on Sunday, Juventus moved up to second with a hard-fought 2-0 victory at Atalanta after 19-year-old English forward Samuel Iling-Junior scored his first professional goal before Dusan Vlahovic sealed the win in injury time.  
Victory moved Juve —who host Sevilla in the Europa League semi-finals on Thursday — up to 66 points, two points clear of Lazio and three ahead of fourth-placed Inter Milan in a tight race for Champions League spots with four rounds left in the season.  
England youth international Iling-Junior netted 55 minutes into his first start in Italy’s top flight before Vlahovic finished the job from a devastating counter-attack with his 10th league goal of a difficult season, celebrating by putting his finger to his lips to silence the home fans who had racially abused him.  
The Serbia was insulted as a “gypsy”, abuse which had led to the match being briefly stopped by referee Daniele Doveri. The Italian word for gypsy is often used by sections of football supporters as a slur for players from the Balkans and eastern Europe, regardless of their ethnicity.  
“Unfortunately these chants keep happening, they need to be fought against,” said Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri to DAZN. “I think we need to ignore them when they happen and let those in charge take action.”  
MILAN CLUBS WIN AHEAD OF CL SHOWDOWN 
On Saturday, AC Milan and Inter secured matching 2-0 victories over Roman clubs as they briefly swapped places ahead of their Champions League semi-final clash.   
An early goal by Ismael Bennacer and a Theo Hernandez stunner saw Milan briefly jump from sixth to fourth, leapfrogging Inter, with a home victory over Lazio in the early game.   
“We played a great game. Now there is plenty of time to recover ahead of the semi-final against Inter,” said Milan coach Stefano Pioli. “Now let’s think about the Champions League.”   
Inter then jumped back to fourth, two points ahead of Milan, when they won away at Roma with midfielder Federico Dimarco and striker Romelu Lukaku were both on target as, keeping Jose Mourinho’s team outside the European places.   
Inter coach, Simone Inzaghi said the Champions League semi-final would be “a showdown played over 180 minutes”. “We know what we have to do,” he added.   
Roma also have an eye on Europe. They stayed seventh, five points behind Inter in the last Champions League place, but have another route into that competition if they win the Europa League. Roma host Bayer Leverkusen in the first leg of a semi-final on Thursday.

11,Iftikhar’s heroics fail to keep Pakistan top as New Zealand grab consolation win,"New Zealand defeat Pakistan by 47 runs in the final ODI of the five-match series, which Pakistan won 4-1","KARACHI: It was set up perfectly for Pakistan. A decent crowd at the National Stadium here on a breezy Sunday night was in celebratory mood as the hosts sought to cement their number one spot in the ICC ODI Rankings in the fifth and final match of the One-day International series against New Zealand and close a memorable home season.
The spectators were also here to watch captain Babar Azam give them yet another treat on his 100th ODI outing. But as it turned out, it seemed as if Pakistan found themselves weighed down by the occasion.
However, despite an anticlimactic end that saw the match end as a 47-run win for New Zealand with a dubious umpiring decision for a run-out, Iftikhar Ahmed made a strong case for a place in Pakistan’s first XI.
The muscular right-hander blasted an unbeaten 93 off 71 balls with eight fours and two sixes to take Pakistan close but his partners at the other end — other than Salman Ali Agha (57), who was involved with Iftikhar for a 97-run knock — did not support him enough.
That, however, was also down to a fighting performance from the New Zealand bowlers, who have struggled throughout the series – pacer Henry Shipley leading the way with three wickets for just 34 runs in his nine overs.

After Pakistan opener Shan Masood had departed early, Shipley made Babar his first prey, silencing the crowd chanting the Pakistan skipper’s name since he had walked into bat with “100” printed on the back of his shirt.
Pakistan’s hopes of securing their first 5-0 ODI series win in five years were dealt with a massive blow as Shipley trap­ped Mohammad Rizwan lbw, leaving Pakistan reeling at 52-3 by the end of the 14th over.
Fakhar Zaman falling to slow left-armer Rachin Ravindra (3-65) five overs later pushed Pakistan further into trouble but a steady show by Salman and Iftikhar took the side past the 100-run mark in the 26th over.
After the duo reached their 50-run partnership by the end of the 28th over, Salman went on the offensive with a six off Ravindra and two fours against leg-spinner Ish Sodhi.
Iftikhar joined the party with a pull off pacer Matt Henry for a boundary two balls before Salman brought up his second half-century in a row. It was all over for the latter, though, when he became Shipley’s third victim in the 35th over.
Shadab Khan was the next to go after Iftikhar brought up his fifty in 48 balls. A few lusty blows by the incoming Usama Mir and Iftikhar himself didn’t help much before tailender Haris Rauf was run-out by Henry at the non-striker end despite TV replays not looking decisive enough.

Earlier, opener Will Young struck 87 off 91 balls, hitting eight fours and two sixes in a show of great control and immaculate shot selection to help New Zealand post 299.
Although leg-spinner Shadab was Pakistan’s second-most expensive bowler — leaking 67 runs in 10 overs – his two wickets, that of Young and Mark Chapman, proved key in helping the hosts restrict New Zealand to what turned out to be an unachievable score when they seemed to be cruising towards a way bigger total.
Once New Zealand skipper Tom Latham’s anchoring knock of 59 off 58 balls ended, Pakistan pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi (3-45) tore through the New Zealand tail, fizzling out the Black Caps’ hopes of getting a consolation victory.
Young put up a 51-run partnership with Henry Nicolls, who became leg-spinner Usama first prey before reached his half-century in the 19th over and brought up New Zealand’s 100 two overs later.
He used his feet to perfection and two of his boundaries and one of his sixes came as a result of the right-hander dancing down the ground to swivel his bat off his pads to find the midwicket boundary.
But when he danced down the ground against Shadab once more, this time to clear the extra-cover boundary before striking for four more, Pakistan must have felt the heat. However, it was Shadab only, who struck gold for the hosts two overs later with a sharp spinning delivery to get the better of the batter.
With Young gone, the in-form Chapman boosted New Zealand’s prospects to put on a big total with two sixes and as many fours off Salman’s off-break in the 34th over, by which the visitors had 195-3 on the board. But three overs later, Shadab came back to get another big wicket.
Latham, who had worked hard to keep his side stable, followed Chapman in Usama’s (2-53) 42nd over but he and his side had done enough.

Defeat would have left Arsenal’s hopes of a first title since 2004 hanging by a thread but Martin Odegaard’s brilliant strike and a Fabian Schar own goal sealed a vital victory.  
Newcastle’s second home defeat of the season slows the Magpies’ charge towards Champions League football next season as their lead over fifth-placed Liverpool remains three points.  
Arsenal held an eight-point lead just a month ago but had won just one of their last five league games to let the destiny of the title slip out of their hands.  
Mikel Arteta’s men, though, showcased their improvement over the last 12 months since defeat at St. James’ Park last season cost them a place in the top four.  
Newcastle dominated early on but Odegaard’s sweet strike after 14 minutes gave the visitors the lead. The Norwegian took aim from long-range and arrowed the ball low bey­ond Nick Pope’s left hand.  
Schar then inadvertently turned in Gabriel Martinelli’s cross with 20 minutes remaining.  
City, who have won 10 straight games to overhaul Arsenal, have 82 points from 34 games with the Gunners on 81 having played a game more. Newcastle stay third on 65 could slip to fourth if Manchester United win their game in hand. 
LIVERPOOL TARGET TOP FOUR 
Liverpool’s hopes of a top-four finish continued as they beat Brentford 1-0 at Anfield in Saturday’s late match, 
Liverpool closed to within one point of Manchester United as Mohamed Salah’s first-half goal was enough for a sixth consecutive win for Jurgen Klopp’s men.  
Salah bagged the only goal of the game in the 13th minute, starting the move before Fabinho crossed to Virgil van Dijk at the back post, and the big Dutchman headed the ball back for the Egyptian to bundle home his 100th goal at Anfield.  
“It means a lot to me,” said the Egyptian. “I feel at home here, I’m happy. We need to finish the season the best possible way.”  
United, who have two games in hand, and Newcastle are still strong favourites to secure a place in the Champions League but Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool are at least applying the pressure thanks to their best run of form in a disappointing season. 
“Six games ago nobody would have thought we would be here,” Klopp said. “We cannot do more than win football games. We have to make sure we finish the situation in the best possible way.”
