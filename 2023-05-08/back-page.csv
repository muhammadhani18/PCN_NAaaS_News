CAIRO: The Arab League on Sunday welcomed back Syria’s government, ending a more than decade-long suspension and securing President Bashar al-Assad’s return to the Arab fold after years of isolation.
The ministers of the 22-member body in a statement emphasised their “keenness to launch a leading Arab role in efforts to resolve” the Syria crisis and its “humanitarian, security and political consequences”, noting that humanitarian aid must reach “all those in need”.
They also agreed to form a ministerial committee to continue “direct dialogue with the Syrian government in order to reach a comprehensive solution”.
Ahmed Aboul Gheit, head of the 22-member Arab League, said the decision “brings the Arab side into communication with the Syrian government for the first time in years, in order to look into all aspects of the problem”.

Panel formed for talks with Syrian govt; Damascus says next stage requires ‘mutual respect’ and joint work for ‘common Arab interests’

Syria’s return to the body is “the beginning... not the end of the issue”, he added, noting it was up to individual countries to decide whether to resume ties with Damascus.
Following the announcement, Syria’s foreign ministry stressed the importance of “Arab cooperation”, in a statement carried by state news agency Sana.
“The next stage requires an effective and constructive Arab approach... based on dialogue, mutual respect and common Arab interests”, it added.
The Arab League had suspended membership of Damascus over its crackdown on anti-government protests that started in 2011. Several Arab countries cut ties with Syria early in the conflict, betting on Assad’s demise, while some including Qatar and Saudi Arabia provided support to the Syrian opposition.
The civil conflict resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, displacement of millions, and extensive damage to the country’s infrastructure and industry. While the front lines have mostly quietened, large parts of the country’s north remain outside government control.
Summit, mutual respect
“Government delegations from the Syrian Arab Republic will resume their participation in Arab League meetings” starting Sunday, said a unanimous decision by the group’s foreign ministers.
Assad has been politically isolated since the war began, but recent weeks have seen a flurry of diplomatic activity, ahead of an Arab League summit in the Saudi city of Jeddah on May 19.
On Sunday, Syria called for Arab states to show “mutual respect”, after the Arab League voted to readmit it following more than a decade of estrangement over the Syrian civil war.
Arab states should pursue “an effective approach based on mutual respect”, the Syrian foreign ministry said in a statement that also stressed the “importance of joint work and dialogue to undertake the challenges facing Arab countries”.
Diplomatic push
The United Arab Emirates, which re-established ties in late 2018, has been leading the recent charge to reintegrate Damascus into the Arab fold.
A Feb 6 earthquake that wreaked devastation in Turkiye and Syria sparked Arab outreach to Assad’s government, while intensified diplomatic activity has been under way in the region since a historic decision by Saudi Arabia and Iran to resume ties.

1,Imran asks ticket-holders to mobilise voters,Asks party leaders to win over the hearts of the disgruntled activists by redressing their complaints.,"LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan has urged upon the party’s ticket-holders to build a momentum for the elections by mobilising voters in their respective constituencies, while a schedule for his public meetings in the strongholds of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz in Punjab is also being finalised.
In a meeting with a group of ticket-holders at his Lahore residence on Sunday, Mr Khan urged them to hold more and more rallies and public meetings as well as going door-to-door in their election campaign. He asked them to win over the hearts of the disgruntled activists by redressing their complaints and try to reach as many voters as possible.
The directive was issued as PTI is scheduling the party chairman’s public meetings in the towns along G.T. Road, which is considered as citadels of the rival PML-N and the first such meeting in this regard will be held in Muridke, on Wed­nesday. One public meeting will be held in Gakhar Mandi and Lalamusa each on Thursday.
The public meetings would be followed by meetings in Gujar Khan and Attock. Mr Khan will address these meetings, though a formal schedule would be announced only after his approval, disclosed a person who attended the meeting.
The chairman was quoted as thanking the people for showing street power on Saturday to express solidarity with the Supreme Court on the Punjab polls.
He stressed that the people took to the streets for upholding the Constitution and not for any person. He said the Constitution called for polls within 90 days of the dissolution of an assembly but the government was defying the constitutional provision as well as the apex court verdict on the issue.

2,Shooting rampage at Texas mall leaves nine dead,Police quickly respond to gunfire and ‘neutralise’ the shooter,"WASHINGTON: A man went on a rampage at a Texas outlet mall on Saturday, shooting dead eight people and wounding several others before he was killed by a police officer.
Video footage circulating online showed the shooter getting out of a sedan in the mall’s parking lot before opening fire on people walking nearby.
An officer inside on an unrelated call quickly responded to the gunfire and “neutralised” the shooter as scenes of panic broke out at the sprawling facility in Allen, police said.
The identity of the shooter was not released. His body, sprawled on a sidewalk, was one of seven deaths at the mall when more police arrived.

Police quickly respond to gunfire and ‘neutralise’ the shooter

Two others died at hospital while “three are in critical surgery, and four are stable,” said Allen fire chief Jonathan Boyd.
The shooting at Allen Premium Outlets, 55km north of Dallas, began around 3.30pm when it was busy with weekend shoppers, police said.
The officer in the mall “heard gunshots, went to the gunshots, engaged the suspect and neutralised the suspect,” said chief Brian Harvey of the Allen police department.
Some of the victims were as young as five years old, a hospital official told NBC News.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott called the mass shooting an “unspeakable tragedy.”
President Biden denounced the “senseless acts of violence” and ordered US flags flown at half-staff at federal buildings, military posts and American embassies until sunset, May 11, “as a mark of respect for the victims.”
Local officials hailed the actions of the police officer who charged and killed the shooter. “We owe a debt of gratitude to first responders that ran towards the gunfire and acted swiftly to neutralise the threat,” said Keith Self, a Republican congressman whose district includes the city of Allen.
Authorities believed initially that a second shooter might be on the loose.
As police combed through stores in the mall, frantic shoppers and store employees rushed into parking lots.
Harvey later said police believe the unidentified shooter, who CNN said was wearing tactical gear, “acted alone.” Janet St James, a spokesperson for Medical City Healthcare said it received eight patients from the shooting, ranging in age from five to 61, NBC News reported.
“Allen is a proud and safe city which makes today’s senseless act of violence even more shocking,” mayor Ken Fulk said in a statement.
“I want to commend our police and fire departments for their quick response. Their thorough training not to hesitate to move toward the threat likely saved more lives today.”
‘No more safe places’
Jaynal Pervez, who arrived at the mall while his daughter was inside, told CNN: “There’s no more safe places. I don’t know what to do.”
Pervez told CBS the scenes in the mall parking lot had been chaotic. “I saw the shoes around there, people’s cell phones on the street,” he said.
With more firearms than inhabitants, the United States has the highest rate of gun deaths of any developed country — 49,000 in 2021, up from 45,000 the year before.
There have been more than 195 mass shootings so far this year in the US.

3,Two deaths from Congo virus alert health authorities,"In the past four months, four people have died of Congo virus, official says.","QUETTA / KARACHI: Health authorities were alerted on Sunday after two deaths from the Congo virus were reported in Karachi and Quetta.
The first victim was a 20-year-old pregnant Afghan woman, according to the health authorities. Gul Naz was brought from Kuchlak with symptoms of the virus and admitted to Quetta’s Fatima Jinnah Chest Hospital.
She was bleeding from mouth and nose and her blood samples were sent to a laboratory, which confirmed the disease.
She couldn’t survive and died Sunday morning, Dr Zubair Ahmed of the hospital told Dawn.
 
 

He confirmed that this was the third death from the virus in the last 10 days. “In the past four months, four people have died of Congo virus.” All patients had travelled to Afghanistan, he said.
One death in Karachi
The Sindh health department also confirmed the death of a 28-year-old man in Karachi. The deceased, Mohammad Adil of Liaquatabad, was a meat seller.
“Initially, he developed a headache and fever on April 30, which intensified two days later. He was taken to a private hospital where he remained under treatment for a day,” a health department official said. The victim later had episodes of nasal bleeding.
The patient was initially tested for dengue and malaria, but the results came negative, the official added.
“On May 4, the patient’s condition deteriorated and he was admitted to Ziauddin Hospital in North Nazimabad. He passed away a day later,” he said.

4,India’s attempt to link Bilawal’s remarks to threat of violence ‘mischievous’: FO,ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office has resented the Indian insinuation that Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had...,"ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office has resented the Indian insinuation that Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had threatened New Delhi for its plans to hold G20 meetings in held Kashmir, stressing that linking his remarks to the threat of violence was “mischievous” and “highly irresponsible”.
In a statement issued on Sunday, FO spokeswoman Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said the foreign minister, during his visit to India, had emphasised the “critical importance of relevant UNSC resolutions” for a peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. “Clearly, he based his case on international law,” she said.
Ms Baloch said the foreign ministry had already articulated Pakistan’s position on the G20 Tourism Working Group meeting in held Kashmir. In the April statement, the ministry had condemned India’s “irresponsible move” to hold the G20 Tourism Working Group meeting in Srinagar on May 22-24. It also said that scheduling two other meetings of a consultative forum on youth affairs (Y-20) in Leh and Srinagar in heldKashmir was “equally disconcerting”.
Ms Baloch said, “Any insinuation, associating foreign minister’s remarks with a threat of violence, is not only mischievous but highly irresponsible,” she said. “It is an attempt to shift focus from the Foreign Minister’s key message of conflict resolution through dialogue and in accordance with international law and UNSC resolutions.”
FM Bhutto-Zardari, during his visit to India for SCO foreign ministers’ meeting, again condemned New Delhi’s decision to hold G20 meetings in the disputed territory.
Answering questions on the matter in a media talk after the SCO moot, he said: “Obviously we condemn it and at the time we will give such a response that it will be remembered.”
He said holding meetings in the disputed territory showed India’s “pettiness” and was “a show of arrogance to the world that to hell with international law, UNSC resolutions and bilateral agreements, India will hold its events in Kashmir”.
Subsequently, Indian news outlets described Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s remarks as a “veiled threat to India”.

5,UN aid chief arrives in S. Arabia for Sudan peace talks,KHARTOUM: The UN’s top humanitarian official arrived in Saudi Arabia on Sunday for ceasefire talks between...,"KHARTOUM: The UN’s top humanitarian official arrived in Saudi Arabia on Sunday for ceasefire talks between Sudan’s warring generals, as gun battles and air strikes flared in the Sudanese capital at the start of a fourth week of fighting.
Multiple truce deals have been declared and quickly violated since battles erupted on April 15 in the country with a history of political instability.
Fierce combat since then has killed hundreds of people, most of them civilians, wounded thousands and sparked multiple warnings of a potential “catastrophic” humanitarian crisis.
Across the Red Sea in the Saudi city of Jeddah, talks were under way aiming for a ceasefire that could push efforts to bring humanitarian aid to the besieged population.
Army spokesman Brigadier General Nabil Abdalla said the talks were on how a truce “can be correctly implemented to serve the humanitarian side”, while Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who heads the Rapid Support Forces, only said on Twitter that he welcomed the technical discussions.
The UN’s top humanitarian official, Martin Griffiths, was in Jeddah on Sunday “and the purpose of his visit is to engage in humanitarian issues related to Sudan,” spokesperson Eri Kaneko said.
Griffiths was last week in Port Sudan, where he said he had been informed by the UN’s World Food Programme that six trucks bringing aid to the Darfur region had been “looted en route” on Wednesday, “despite assurances of safety and security”.
He called for security guarantees “clearly given by militaries, to protect humanitarian systems to deliver”.
There was no indication that Griffiths would play a direct role in the Saudi discussions about a possible ceasefire.
Riyadh and Washington have supported the “pre-negotiation talks” and urged the belligerents to “get actively involved”.

6,‘Underfunded’ WFP to suspend food aid to Palestinians from next month,Israeli forces demolish a Palestinian primary school in occupied West Bank.,"

GAZA: The World Food Prog­ramme (WFP) will suspend food aid to over 200,000 Palestinians from next month due to a “severe” shortage of funds, the group’s senior official for the Palestinian territories said on Sunday.
“In light of the severe funding shortages, WFP is forced to make painful choices to stretch the limited resources,” Samer Abdeljaber, the WFP’s country director, said. “WFP would have to start suspending assistance to over 200,000 people, which is 60 per cent of its current case load, from June.” The most impacted families are in Gaza, where food insecurity and poverty are the highest, and in the West Bank.
The United Nations agency offers impoverished Palestinians both monthly vouchers with a value of $10.30 per person and food baskets. Both programmes will be affected.
Gaza, which has been run by the Hamas group since 2007, is home to 2.3 million people, of which 45pc are unemployed and 80pc depend on international aid, according to Palestinian and UN records.

“WFP understands the implications of this unavoidable and hard decision on hundreds of thousands of people who also depend on food assistance for their most basic needs,” said Abdeljaber.
Citing security concerns with the enclave’s Hamas rulers, Israel has led a blockade together with Egypt that has put restrictions on the movement of people and goods for years.
Chanting “No to Hunger” dozens of Palestinians staged a protest outside the WFP offices in Gaza City to protest the decision.
“The voucher is life, the message they sent us equals death since there is no other source of income,” said Faraj Al-Masri, a father of two, whose family gets vouchers worth $41.20 per month.
In Jabalia, in the northern Gaza Strip, Jamalat El-Dabour, whose family receives $164.80 worth of vouchers per month, said they will “starve to death” as her husband was sick and unemployed.
Israel demolishes school
Meanwhile, Israeli forces on Sunday demolished a Palestinian primary school in the occupied West Bank citing safety issues, drawing sharp criticism from the European Union which had funded the project.
Palestinians hurled rocks at Israeli forces who fired tear gas at them, as bulldozers moved in on the site at Jabbet al-Dhib village near Bethlehem.
The EU said it was “appalled” after Israeli forces arrived at dawn at the school site, which a Palestinian Authority official said served 45 students and consisted of five classrooms.
A caravan and classrooms constructed of tin sheeting were cleared out of their contents before the demolition.
COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body overseeing civilian affairs in the occupied territories, imposed in March a two-month deadline to vacate the premises following an order by a Jerusalem court.
The body had determined that the school had been “built illegally” and posed a “safety hazard”.
Ahmed Naser, a Palestinian education ministry official, said the school had replaced another school demolished by Israel in 2019.
Naser noted its remote location, which he said prevents the “displacement and forced eviction” of local Palestinians, charging that Israel “wants to confiscate these lands”.
The EU called on Israel to “halt all demolitions and evictions, which will only increase the suffering of the Palestinian population and further escalate an already tense environment”.
“Demolitions are illegal under international law, and children’s right to education must be respected,” the office of the EU representative to the Palestinian Territories said in a statement.
New settlements
On the other hand, Israel published tenders for over 1,000 new housing units in the occupied West Bank, despite a commitment it made in US-backed talks in February that discussion of new settlement units would be halted.
The expansion of settlements has been among the most contentious issues between Israel and the international community for decades. It has continued despite repeated calls for construction to stop from allies including the US.
Israel’s housing ministry claimed, “All the tenders that were published are in line with the rules and have received the required permissions, including from the defence minister.”
There was no comment from the defence ministry.
Since the meeting in Jordan, attended by US, Egyptian, Jor­danian, Palestinian and Israeli officials, the Israel Land Authority has published on its website separate tenders for 1,248 new housing units in illegal settlements of occupied West Bank.
