0,Japanese PM tells South Koreans his ‘heart hurts’ over pain caused by occupation,Stops short of offering new official apology for wrongs committed under the 1910-1945 occupation.,"SEOUL: Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told South Koreans on Sunday his ‘heart hurts’ when he thinks of suffering and pain during Japanese colonial rule, in a nod to historical disputes that have soured relations between the two US allies.
Kishida was in Seoul for the first visit to the South Korean capital by a Japanese leader in 12 years, returning the trip South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol made to Tokyo in March where they sought to close a chapter on the historical disputes that have dominated Japan-South Korea relations for decades.
Speaking to reporters after his summit with Yoon, Kishida stopped short of offering a new official apology for wrongs committed under the 1910-1945 occupation, but said his government inherits the stance of earlier administrations, some of which have issued apologies.
“For me personally, my heart hurts when I think of the many people who endured terrible suffering and grief under the difficult circumstances of the time,” he said.
Yoon said unresolved historical issues should not mean that no forward steps can be taken to deepen ties.
A senior official at Yoon’s office said Kishida’s remarks had not been pre-arranged and Yoon thanked him for “showing his sincere position even though there was no such request,” and said it would be “greatly helpful for future cooperation.” The pledge by the leaders to boost cooperation has been welcomed by the United States as a way to better confront threats from North Korea and competition from China.
“Cooperation and coordination between South Korea and Japan are essential not only for the common interests of the two countries, but also for world peace and prosperity,” Yoon said in opening remarks at their meeting.

1,Anti-monarchists criticise arrests at Charles coronation,More than 14 million people tuned in to watch King Charles III’s coronation on BBC television.,"LONDON: Anti-monarchists on Sunday criticised the policing of the coronation of King Charles as heavy-handed, saying there was no longer a right to peaceful protest in Britain after dozens of protesters were arrested and detained into the night.
Police arrested Graham Smith, leader of the Republic group, and 51 others in central London as thousands of royal fans gathered in the capital for the event on Saturday, saying their duty to prevent disruption outweighed the right to protest. Republic said that members began to be released late on Saturday evening after nearly 16 hours in custody.
“This was a heavy-handed action which had the appearance of a pre-determined arrest that would have occurred regardless of the evidence or our actions. The right to protest peacefully in the UK no longer exists,” Smith said in a statement.
“These arrests were not about protecting people from harm, but about protecting the King from embarrassment.” The police said on Saturday that they understood public concern following the arrests, but said they acted after receiving information that protesters were determined to disrupt the coronation procession.
London police chief Mark Rowley warned on Friday that police would take action if protesters tried to “obstruct the enjoyment and celebration” of people, saying there would be a “very low tolerance” for disruption.
14m watch coronation
More than 14 million people tuned in to watch King Charles III’s coronation on BBC television, the corporation said on Sunday.
At its peak, 13.4 million watched on the main BBC One channel, with an average of 11.9 million watching Saturday’s coverage of the ceremony.
A signed version on BBC Two peaked at 1.7 million, averaging at 1.4 million, a statement from the public broadcaster read.
Saturday’s coronation — the first to be held in Britain in 70 years — was only the second to be televised, and the first to be shown in colour.
Street parties
On Sunday, tens of thousands of street parties got underway as Britain celebrated the coronation of King Charles III. “It’s lovely… you need these things to bring the community together,” Annette Cathcart, 67, said from at a party at the village hall in Ashley Green, in Buckinghamshire, southern England. “It’s the perfect way to celebrate.”
Prince William and wife Kate surprised fans on Windsor’s Long Walk with an unannounced visit. Buckingham Palace issued a statement saying Charles and Camilla were “deeply touched” by Saturday’s history-making events.
It added they were “profoundly grateful both, to all those who helped to make it such a glorious occasion”.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hosted a lunch at Downing Street, inviting community volunteers, Ukrainian refugees and dignitaries including US First Lady Jill Biden.
The British leader was joined by his wife, two daughters and the family dog, Nova, who sported a union flag bandana. Monday (today) has been declared a public holiday.

2,Wagner group in apparent U-turn on Bakhmut withdrawal,Evacuations spur IAEA’s concern over Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant,"MOSCOW: Russia’s Wagner mercenary group appeared on Sunday to ditch plans to withdraw from Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, saying they had been promised more arms by Moscow and suggesting they may keep up their assault on what Russia sees as a stepping stone to other cities in the Donbas region.
Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin had said on Friday that his fighters, who have spearheaded a months-long assault on Bakhmut, would pull out after being starved of ammunition and suffering “useless and unjustified” losses as a result.
But in an audio message posted on his Telegram channel on Sunday, he said: “We have been promised as much ammunition and weapons as we need to continue further operations. We have been promised that everything needed to prevent the enemy from cutting us off (from supplies) will be deployed.” 
‘Mad panic’
Evacuations from the front line around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant prompted safety warnings from the UN nuclear watchdog, as a string of recent strikes escalate predictions of a looming spring counteroffensive.

Evacuations spur IAEA’s concern over Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant

Moscow has ordered families with children and elderly to temporarily evacuate a slew of Russian-held areas in southern Ukraine, including the town near Europe’s largest nuclear plant.
“The general situation in the area near the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant is becoming increasingly unpredictable and potentially dangerous,” IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said in a statement. “I’m extremely concerned about the very real nuclear safety and security risks facing the plant”, he added. 
The removal order has led to ‘a mad panic and no less mad queues’ at the checkpoint into Russian-annexed Crimea, said Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
The General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said on Sunday that the residents are being evacuated in the direction of Berdiansk and Prymorsk on the coast of the Sea of Azov.
With buses ferrying people out every 20 to 30 minutes, he said stations have been drained of gasoline.
“The partial evacuation they announced is going too fast, and there is a possibility that they may be preparing for provocations and (for that reason) focusing on civilians,” Fedorov wrote on Telegram.
Nationalists targeted
Investigators said Ukraine was behind the blast that wrecked writer Prilepin’s car on Saturday morning in Nizhny Novgorod, around 400 kilometres from Moscow.

Thousands more have been told to be prepared to leave on a moment’s notice, as the number of fires — fanned by strong winds — jumped to 110.
One-third of the blazes were listed as out of control.
“We’ve declared a provincial state of emergency to protect the safety, health and welfare of Albertans,” the province’s Premier Danielle Smith told a news conference after a meeting of her government’s emergency management committee.
Earlier she said the province — one of the world’s largest oil-producing regions — “has been experiencing a hot, dry spring and with so much kindling, all it takes is a few sparks to ignite some truly frightening wildfires.” “These conditions have resulted in the unprecedented situation our province is facing today,” she said. 
According to Smith, more than 20 communities have been evacuated and at least 301,000 acres have burned so far.

4,Indians score high on illegal boats to Britain,"NEW DELHI: Indians are now the second largest group of migrants, after Afghans, crossing into the UK over the ...","NEW DELHI: Indians are now the second largest group of migrants, after Afghans, crossing into the UK over the English Channel on risky small boats, The Wire said on Sunday, quoting the UK Home Office.
British newspapers have given details of the upsurge. According to the data, 675 Indian nationals entered the country by small boat between January and March, amid a “surge in attempts to evade work visa restrictions”, The Daily Mail has reported.
“In contrast, during the first three months of this year the number of Albanians — earlier the [second-largest group] reaching Britain by small boat — fell to 29, compared with 1,100 in the previous quarter. This appeared to reflect official predictions that Albanian numbers would drop off over winter and resume this spring,” the report continued.
A source from the Home Office said, “There’s been an unexplained spike in Indian nationals arriving here by small boat in the last few months. We believe they are attempting to dodge visa checks and are coming here to work illegally in the underground economy.”
Officials from Britain are “taken aback by the sudden rise in the number of Indians looking to take their chances in small boats”, as reported by The Telegraph.
Earlier this year, in January, as per UK Home Office, about 250 Indian migrants entered the UK, outnumbering the 233 who arrived via small boats in the first nine months of last year. Indians often entered Britain lawfully up until last year, but many subsequently overstayed their visas.
This year, Indians have come in just behind Afghans, who form 24 per cent of the people making the perilous sea journey from the European mainland. 
Afghans made up the largest nationality group in the first quarter with 909.
In recent months, The Wire said, there has been a surge in the number of Indian nationals attempting to make the crossing, with many reportedly paying smugglers exorbitant fees to help them reach the UK. Although some have succeeded, others have been intercepted by authorities and detained or deported.
The majority of undocumented Indian immigrants have historically been young people from places like Punjab and Haryana who are unskilled or semi-skilled and seeking higher pay, as per The Telegraph. However, earlier in a report by the newspaper, the Indian government had warned the British government that a crackdown on separatist activity in (Indian) Punjab was to blame for the unexpected increase in persons from this nation trying to enter unlawfully. 
The Indian government has not made any public statements, and the British Home Office claimed it lacked the evidence necessary to determine whether this is truly the case.
Other causes for the unexpected increase in Indians crossing the English Channel include their discovery of entrance ports in nations in Eastern Europe where obtaining legal visas is simpler. To get to the French shore from there, they go a long way and via several European countries. It is 22 miles from France across the English Channel at its narrowest point.

Toufic Kerbage, 65, watched the value of his pay packet and pension evaporate after the Lebanese economy began melting down in 2019, taking the local currency and people’s savings with it. Without family support  “I would have starved,” said the music teacher, who began working at the conservatory in the late 1980s.
“It’s difficult at my age to ask for money”, he said from the silence of the conservatory’s branch in Sin al-Fil, a suburb of the capital Beirut. Once on a comfortable income, Kerbage now earns around $70 a month, in a country the World Bank says suffers the highest food price inflation globally. He has been teaching his classes online, battling Lebanon’s  “disastrous” internet and spending more than he earns on a generator subscription to get through hours-long daily power cuts.
The state-run conservatory, with several thousand mostly school-aged students and 17 branches around the country, counts prestigious musicians like the composer and oud player Marcel Khalife among its alumni.
But as the economic crisis grinds on, some teachers have quit. Many others have turned to online classes to save on travel costs or teach private lessons on the side to make ends meet.

6,Erdogan leads show-of-force rally in Istanbul,Latest polls suggest that Erdogan and opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu are locked in a dead heat and probably heading to a runoff on May 28.,"ISTANBUL: “Istanbul!” President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shouted to the sea of supporters he gathered for a show-of-force rally ahead of next Sunday’s election — the toughest of his two-decade rule.
“If you say okay, we will win for sure!” The masses were packed shoulder-to-shoulder across the tarmac of Istanbul’s old Ataturk airport: a tidal wave of Turkish flags and banners with the 69-year-old president’s face.
Erdogan was the mayor of this city before leading his Islamic-rooted party to power and ending half a century of secular rule in the mostly Muslim but officially secular state.
The loss of Istanbul to the opposition in 2019 mayoral elections cracked Erdogan’s aura of invincibility and sounded the first warning bell for the approaching vote.
The latest polls suggest that Erdogan and opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu are locked in a dead heat and probably heading to a runoff on May 28. But surveys in Turkiye are an inexact science and both are trying to show their supporters that they can win outright next weekend by picking up more than 50 per cent of the vote.
Kilicdaroglu staged a smaller but still-impressive rally that filled a park on the Asian side of the city facing the Sea of Marmara the day before. But Erdogan and his party charted 10,000 buses to bring in people from 39 provinces for what the president dubbed  “the rally of the century” on Sunday.
He claimed that more than a million people had shown up — and aerial footage of the event beamed live across the nation suggested that Erdogan might have been right.

7,Dutch suspects arrested in Germany over ATM robbery,FRANKFURT: Two Dutch nationals have been arrested on suspicion of blowing up a cash machine in Germany and stealing ...,"FRANKFURT: Two Dutch nationals have been arrested on suspicion of blowing up a cash machine in Germany and stealing a large sum after a car chase, German authorities said on Sunday.
Using explosives to carry out bank machine robberies has become increasingly common in Germany.
The latest incident took place on Saturday in the centre of Bad Homburg, outside Frankfurt, according to a joint statement from police and prosecutors.
Explosives were used to break open the cash machine, with the bank housing it  “badly damaged due to the force of the explosion,” they said.
More than 150,000 euros ($168,000) was stolen before the men made off in a car, with police in pursuit in cars and a helicopter. The suspects’ vehicle broke through a police barrier on the access road to a motorway but was then brought to a halt by spikes laid across the road.
A first suspect, aged 25, was caught in the area after a short pursuit on foot and the stolen money was recovered from the car. The second, aged 27, was also picked up in the manhunt, authorities said.
The pair were arrested on suspicion of causing an explosion and theft. They are also suspected of attempted murder due to the force of the explosion in the centre of Bad Homburg. The hunt for a third suspect is ongoing.
Searches related to the robbery also took place in the Dutch cities of Amsterdam and Utrecht on Saturday, German authorities said.

8,Christians seek SC probe into Manipur violence,Plea filed by Manipur Tribal Forum says situation in the state is  “extreme”.,"NEW DELHI: A Bench led by Chief Justice of India D. Y. Chandrachud is scheduled on Monday (today) to hear a petition filed by a Delhi-based body for Manipur tribal communities seeking the constitution of a special investigation team to probe the attacks and violence which has gripped the Manipur.
More than 50 persons were killed in ethnic violence on Wednesday, which saw assaults on and destruction of dozens of churches, reports say the majority Hindu Meiti community is seeking to be given the status of Manipur’s tribespeople, a move opposed by extant tribal groups who are mainly Christian.
The petition, filed on Saturday was urgently listed for hearing, a three-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice and accompanied by Justices P. S. Narasimha and J. B. Pardiwala.
The petition filed by Manipur Tribal Forum, through advocate Satya Mitra and senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, said the situation in the state was “extreme” and these “attacks had the full support of the party in power in the State as well as the Centre which supports the dominant group and has planned the attacks on account of a non-secular agenda”.
The Manipur Tribal Forum said there have been sparks even in the national capital where Kukis have come under attack by the “dominant community”.
“The assaults have also spread to Delhi where the Kukis in Delhi are also coming under attack by the dominant community. Similar attacks are also taking place in Meghalaya,” it said. The petition said armed groups were seen roving with semi-automatic weapons, doing house searches, in Manipur.
“Petitioners have a few videos and photos of the assailants during the assault on the tribals and some of these videos and photos show burning of churches, beating of tribals and assailants walking around with semi-automatic weapons, which is surprising because even the police force would not be in possession of such modern and deadly weapons,” the petition said. It said there was also a spread of online hate speech.
“Up to today, approximately 41 churches have been razed to the ground, wherein the mobs went on a rampage, burning houses and vehicles, and business establishments and even hospitals belonging to the tribals,” the petition said.
It has asked the apex court to order a team to be put together to conduct an inquiry into the villages burnt and assess the value of property destroyed in the violence. The petition has listed at least 58 villages in this regard. The petition said the state should be directed to compensate the people and reconstruct the churches.
“Thirty tribals were killed by the dominant community and 132 injured… Neither FIR was registered nor was there any investigation taking place as the police itself is on the side of the dominant community and has stood by idle while the killings took place,” the petition alleged.
The forum has urged the court to direct a special investigation team to be headed by a former director general of police of Assam to investigate and prosecute the crimes.
The tribal body has alleged that the conditions faced by tribal people sheltered in six police force camps are “deplorable and pathetic”.
“Each of them holds approximately a thousand-odd tribals and more, with many of them without food and most of them have not been able to have a bath for days. Their conditions are deplorable and pathetic,” the petition said.
It has sought a direction to take the tribal people back to their homes in the hill districts. The Bench would also hear a separate petition filed by Chairman of the Hill Areas Committee (HAC) of the Manipur Legislative Assembly, Dinganglung Gangmei, who has challenged a State High Court order to grant Scheduled Tribe status to the Meitei community. The petition alleged that the High Court order led to the Meitei-Kuki clashes in Manipur.

9,Iran sports boss quits after women compete unveiled,Local organisers of the public event have been summoned to provide “explanations”.,"TEHRAN: The head of Iran’s athletics federation resigned on Sunday over a sporting event featuring women without the mandatory headscarf, state media reported, as the Islamic republic toughens enforcement of hijab rules.
“Hashem Siami resigned from his post due to the controversies that arose from the endurance (running) race organised in Shiraz” in Iran, official news agency IRNA said.
According to images from Friday’s competition published by Iranian media, some women were running without headscarves, made compulsory shortly after the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Local organisers of the public event have also been summoned to provide “explanations”, the provincial prosecutor said in a statement.
Siami told IRNA he was not involved in organising the competition, and the unveiled athletes were not part of the national federation.
A new police programme came into force last month aiming for stricter enforcement of hijab-wearing in public.
The number of women in Iran defying the dress code has increased since a wave of protests following the September 16 death in custody of Kurdish-Iranian Mahsa Amini, 22, for allegedly breaching it.
Authorities in Tehran last week launched proceedings against at least four actors who had appeared in public without a headscarf, local media said.
More than 150 commercial establishments nationwide were closed after employees had allegedly violated the dress code, authorities said in mid-April.
Police in Shiraz arrested in June girls who removed their veils at a skateboarding event, as well as the organisers.

10,Vietnam reports record-high temperature,The country’s scientists have warned that global warming is exacerbating adverse weather.,"HANOI: Vietnam has reported a record-high temperature, with climate experts warning such extreme weather events would continue.
The country’s scientists have warned that global warming is exacerbating adverse weather, with the region sweltering under a heatwave in April — when neighbouring countries also registered record temperatures.
A temperature of 44.1 degrees Celcius (111.38 degrees Fahrenheit) was measured in Vietnam on Saturday, the National Centre for Hydro Meteorological Forecasting said, breaking the 2019 record of 43.4 degrees Celsius.
Farmer Nguyen Thi Lan said that temperatures in the central city of Danang had been increasingly hot, forcing workers to start earlier than ever. “We have had to finish before 10am to avoid the heat,” she said. Lan said forecasters said temperatures had risen to nearly 40 degrees Celsius.
“But at lunchtime, I think it was much hotter.” Vietnam’s weather varies from north to south, but the entire country is now entering its hottest summer months.
The record temperature was measured indoors at Hoi Xuan station in northern Thanh Hoa province. It topped the previous high of 43.4 degrees Celsius, recorded in April 2019 at Huong Khe District in central Ha Tinh Province.
“This is a worrying record in the context of climate change and global warming,” climate change expert Nguyen Ngoc Huy said from the capital Hanoi.

The victims in the morning crash were waiting at a bus stop near a shelter for the homeless used by migrants. He said some migrants were among the dead.
“We are doing an investigation in forms of intoxication to see if he was intoxicated at the time of the accident,” said Sandoval, the police official.
The city of Brownsville, on the border with Mexico, is one of the places expecting an influx of migrants when Covid-era restrictions expire on Thursday.

12,Yellen warns of crisis if Congress fails to act on debt,WASHINGTON: US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Sunday issued a stark warning that a failure by Congress to act on...,"WASHINGTON: US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Sunday issued a stark warning that a failure by Congress to act on the debt ceiling could trigger a “constitutional crisis” that also would call into question the federal government’s creditworthiness.
Yellen sounded the alarm over possible financial market consequences if the debt ceiling is not raised by early June, when she has said the federal government could run short of cash to pay its bills.
The negotiations on the issue should not take place “with a gun to the head of the American people”, Yellen told the ABC programme This Week. Biden has asked Congress to raise the debt ceiling with no conditions. The Republican-led House of Representatives last month passed a bill that would raise the government’s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, but the measure included sweeping spending cuts over the next decade that Biden and his fellow Democrats oppose.
Biden is preparing to meet on Tuesday at the White House with Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and top congressional Democrats to discuss the issue.
“It’s Congress’s job to do this. If they fail to do it, we will have an economic and financial catastrophe that will be of our own making,” Yellen said.
“And we should not get to the point where we need to consider whether the president can go on issuing debt. This would be a constitutional crisis,” Yellen added. 
Biden has steadfastly said he will not negotiate over the debt ceiling increase, but would discuss budget cuts after a new limit is passed.

14,Hollywood strikes inflamed by claim AI could do writers’ jobs,"LOS ANGELES: The Hollywood writers’ strike broke out this week over pay, but the refusal of studios like Netflix...","LOS ANGELES: The Hollywood writers’ strike broke out this week over pay, but the refusal of studios like Netflix and Disney to rule out artificial intelligence replacing human scribes in the future has only fuelled anger and fear on the picket lines.
With their rapidly advancing ability to eerily mimic human conversation, AI programs like ChatGPT have spooked many industries recently. The White House this week summoned Big Tech to discuss the potential risks.
As part of the weeks-long talks with studios and streamers that collapsed on Monday, the Writers Guild of America asked for binding agreements to regulate the use of AI.
Under the proposals, nothing written by AI can be considered “literary” or “source” material — industry terms that decide who gets royalties — and scripts written by WGA members cannot “be used to train AI.” But according to the WGA, studios “rejected our proposal,” and countered with an offer merely to meet once a year to “discuss advancements in technology.” 
“It’s nice for them to offer to have a meeting about how they’re exploiting it against us!” joked WGA negotiating committee member Eric Heisserer, who wrote Netflix hit film “Bird Box.” “Art cannot be created by a machine. You lose the heart and soul of the story... I mean, the first word is ‘artificial,’” he said on the picket line outside the streaming giant’s Hollywood HQ.
While writers already know this, the danger is that “we have to watch tech companies destroy the business in an attempt to find out for themselves,” he said.
‘Not just scripts’
While few television and film writers who spoke to agency on the picket lines believe their work could be done by computers, the apparent conviction of studios and streamers that it can has been an extra slap in the face.
They fear that belt-tightening executives in Hollywood, where Silicon Valley companies have upended many traditional practices such as long-term contracts for writers, may seek to cut costs further by getting computers to write their next hit shows.
Comments by top Hollywood executives at this week’s Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills will have done nothing to quell writers’ concerns.
“In the next three years, you’re going to see a movie that was written by AI made... a good one,” said movie producer Todd Lieberman.
“Not just scripts. Editing, all of it... storyboarding a movie, anything,” added Fox entertainment CEO Rob Wade.
“AI in the future, maybe not next year or the year after, but if we’re talking 10 years? AI is going to be able to do absolutely all of these things.” The studios’ own account of the breakdown in WGA talks offered a more nuanced take.
In a briefing note, they said writers do not in fact want to outlaw AI, and appear happy to use it “as part of their creative process” — so long as it does not affect their pay.
That scenario “requires a lot more discussion, which we’ve committed to doing,” the studios said.
‘Guardrails’
For Leila Cohan, a 39-year-old writer on Netflix smash hit “Bridgerton,” the only usefulness of AI for writers is limited to “busy work” such as coming up with names for characters.
But she predicted that studios “could start making incredibly bad first drafts with AI and then hiring writers to do a rewrite.” “I think that’s certainly a very scary possibility... it’s very smart that we’re addressing this now,” she said.
Indeed, the last Hollywood strike in 2007-08 won writers the right to be paid for online viewing of their shows or films — highly prescient, at a time when streaming was in its infancy.
Back then, Netflix had barely started online viewing, and the likes of Disney+ and Apple TV+ were more than a decade away.
Even for sci-fi writer Ben Ripley, who believes there is no role whatsoever for AI in writing, introducing legislation now “to put guardrails up” is “very necessary.” Writers “have to be original,” he said. “Artificial intelligence is the antithesis of originality”.
