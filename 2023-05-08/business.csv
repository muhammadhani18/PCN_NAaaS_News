0,Winning tickets and elections,Candidates are required to open a bank account to fund electioneering and declare the account number in the nomination paper.," 


Away from the heat of political and legal frictions in Islamabad, aspiring contestants of national and provincial assembly seats in Pakistan must be busy hobbling to mobilise resources deemed necessary to stand a chance in general elections.
In theory, any Pakistani can enter provincial or national assembly on the strength of the public support base in a constituency, expressed through the ballot.
However, even a fleeting look at the finances involved in the process indicates that, in practice, only the rich and those connected with the nexus of the power elite enjoy the opportunity unless some unique circumstances align the stars of a commoner with a resourceful party. At one time, many MNAs and MPAs of MQM and Jamat e Islami, hailing from humble backgrounds, were counted in this category.
“Apart from everything else, electioneering is a costly business, way beyond the means of ordinary folks. How can someone who might find it hard to pay a security deposit to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) at the nomination stage even dream of securing a legislative seat?” a politician from Karachi who aspired to fight and win an election on a general seat back in 2008 told this writer. Later she entered National Assembly on a quota.

Candidates are required to open a bank account to fund electioneering and declare the account number in the nomination paper

Currently, the nomination fee/security deposit is Rs30,000 for the National Assembly and Rs20,000 for the provincial assembly, according to the Election Act 2017. The amount is forfeited in the government’s favour if the candidate’s votes are less than 25 per cent of the total votes polled in the constituency. The last elections saw a sizeable percentage of 6,000 candidates in the run losing their security deposit.
It’s interesting to note that the ‘electioneering period’ for candidates and the Election Commission of Pakistan is different, and therefore, the accounts of candidates liable to scrutiny do not cover the full scale of election spending.
The ECP fiscal rules for a candidate become operational the day one files the nomination papers. “Under the law, a candidate is required to open a dedicated bank account to fund electioneering and declare the account number in the nomination paper,” Qurat ul Ain Fatima, spokesperson ECP, informed over the phone.
She said that the ECP had created a political finance wing in 2022 to improve the financial management of the electoral process. “The law dictates all candidates submit their spending records to the ECP for scrutiny. They are also obligated to route all payments during electioneering through this account.”
The cost matrix of party candidates appears to be different from independents. There might be exceptions, but generally, the cost of running from a popular party platform is higher. Parties often charge dearly for tickets to build up their own finances in the run-up to elections.
Other parties have yet to mobilise, but some sources in Punjab informed confidentially that currently, PTI tickets are on sale and commanding fabulously high prices.
“A friend trying for a PTI ticket told me that more than half of his election budget has been consumed by the party. Of Rs100 million he set aside for elections, he had to pay Rs60m to the party and was anxious if the leftover will suffice for putting up a winning campaign,” a former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry said while discussing the subject over phone.
Another business leader who supports candidates of multiple parties laughed off the spending cap. “I think the limit is absurdly low and more of an unnecessary formality. Either ECP should make it realistic and acquire the scrutinising capacity or drop the idea altogether,” he said.
The government claims to be serious about making elections financially transparent, but the efforts have yet to yield results. The history of attempts to enforce discipline in political finance, however, is even older than the first-ever regular general elections in 1971, held fifteen years after the creation of the ECP in March 1956.
The ECP has been reformed and restructured many times since. Even before 1971, whatever experiments Pakistan did in the name of elections, there were rules regulating the financial conduct of the candidates, even if in theory (See table).

The table was shared with the ECP, which did not contest the content but said it needs time to search for the relevant record to confirm its veracity.
Over the past 60 years, for NA spending limit multiplied many times over, but the findings based on interviews and random market surveys carried out by Dawn in 2013 and 2018 indicated that the money actually infused in the process is nowhere near what the ECP projections suggest or is legally permissible.
According to informed estimates, candidates spent almost 10 times the permissible limits in the last three elections since 2008. In the last elections in 2018, against the limit of Rs0.4m, on average aspiring legislators of NA spent Rs40m, and PA bust the cap of Rs0.2m to spend no less than Rs20m.
“Wonder why ECP can’t see what is visible to the blind. Ask anyone in the street, and his projection of spending by a candidate will be closer to the reality than officials whose job is to monitor and regulate election expenditure. This can’t be an innocent omission,” commented a watcher.
Zafarullah Khan, a civil rights activist and former executive director of the Centre for Civic Education Pakistan, who has worked on political finance, endorsed the view that elections in Pakistan are big money spinners.
“In this day and age of competing powerful interests, there is very little scope for a person with empty pockets in electoral politics. If an aspiring candidate is not rich, he needs rich sponsors.”
Many current and past legislators were approached to share how much did they spend, but the response did not go beyond ‘a lot’. None was ready to say exactly how much. Many found floating estimates absurdly conservative. They did concede that over 80pc of the election economy is cash driven.

1,The super app challenge,Careem’s eroded user base will be a hurdle despite its eye-popping funding.,"For all the cliched takes of finance bros on markets as the best selector of outcomes, the reality is usually different. In fact, they are kind of bipolar, swinging between two opposites — too bullish and too bearish even though the ground realities are often in between. The two years right after Covid-19 were high on the optimism side.
This was the age of “biggest-ever rounds” and shoddy metrics. Money was cheap and abundant enough that everyone thought they could conquer everything. As a result, you’d see well-funded startups quickly launching new verticals within days in an attempt to capture a particular category. The race for the super app was truly on, and leading that in the Middle East, Northern Africa and Pakistan region was its poster child, Careem.
The whole idea behind super apps is to build an active user mass (usually through discounts) around a core service and then offer additional services. That helps reduce customer acquisition costs and increase the average order value, thus making up for neat unit economics in theory.
The model has done wonders in certain parts of the world, such as China or Southeast Asia broadly, led by the likes of WeChat, AliPay and Gojek.

Careem’s eroded user base will be a hurdle despite its eye-popping funding

So once enough money was available in our region, startups thought they could do the same. Careem launched its super app in the middle of 2020 when the world was under peak Covid-19. At the time, the company’s mobility business was seriously disrupted due to lockdowns and needed to diversify to other verticals quickly.
It did too, but mostly just in Dubai, where Careem headquarters are based. There, you can still use the app for a number of things, from booking a cab to ordering food to hopping on a shared electric scooter.
Elsewhere, the story was starkly different. For example, in Pakistan, the food business was shut in 2022 and the payments vertical has long been in limbo. Forget that, the company struggled to hold on to even the core ride business, as by early 2021, customers had started flocking to a new rival, InDrive. This held particularly true for volumetric markets like ours and Egypt’s.
This ambition required spending money that the post-Uber acquisition Careem couldn’t anymore — even for the core service — and the business greatly suffered. But that changed a couple of weeks back when the company announced it had raised $400 million for super apps from e&, or Etisalat Group, the Emirati telecom group which partially owns PTCL too.
This brought together two parties (three, if you count Uber) who have been in the super app race for quite some time. In fact, telcos have been believers in this model long before others came. Remember when Veon spent millions of dollars on building its own version of WeChat and was all over your ads?
For them, the case is simple: average revenue per user from voice has been declining so new revenue streams must be unlocked, which are inevitably going to be in tech instead of telecom. Basically, they are just leveraging those tens of millions of customers.
While the bet didn’t exactly work out for Veon then, the company pivoted slightly to unbundle its offerings. Instead of one super app, it moved to multiple platforms across categories — Jazzcash for financial services was already big, but now there was Tamasha for video entertainment or Bajao for audio streaming. And individually, they have all gotten big, especially in terms of users.
Careem’s partnership with e& should be seen from a similar lens — of a tech company short on cash turning to one of the biggest state-owned groups and that of a telecom player hoping that the region’s poster child will help establish its footprint in digital. In theory, things should work out, but will they?
After all, Careem has all but lost its volumetric markets. In Pakistan, it did over 100m rides in 2019 alone, while from 2020 until October 2022, that number was just 63m. So in almost three years, the company did less than two-thirds of its peak volumes. In almost all countries, it has been displaced from the top spot of Google Play and App Store.
This complicates things because the whole idea was to capitalise on existing critical user mass to sell additional services too. Now, that’s mostly gone and bringing them back requires money. Does this mean we’re back to square one, the same old era of subsidised growth? Not exactly, e& still has millions of sticky customers, which Careem can build for.
But that somewhat masks the broader point: the (un)conventional wisdom passed among startups on how to grow and about things with questionable unit economics and half-baked metrics doesn’t pass the test once markets turn the tide. At least, 99 out of 100 times. Careem could possibly be an exception as the company’s ability to raise eye-popping amounts of capital is unparalleled, something other founders should be mindful about.

2,Pipe dreams of EVs,"Instead of focusing on promoting impractical imports, govt should incentivise local innovation, says a young engineer.","Every morning, in the town of district Swabi, on the road surrounded by lush green outfields, Humza Siddiqui, 22, an engineering student, hurries to his campus building riding his electric bike.
During his undergraduate degree, he developed this bike himself and considers it more fun, economical, and environment-friendly than petroleum-driven bikes. Humza is a final-year Electrical Engineering Student at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“We are trying to innovate in Pakistan, but the most expensive and crucial parts of an electric vehicle, like lithium-ion batteries, are imported, and this creates an environment of uncertainty. Especially since lead iron-phosphate batteries are more efficient but are not imported,” he says.
Fatiq Bin Khursheed, the CEO of Vlektra, an electric bike company based in Karachi, also shares the concern. “There are multiple issues with the supply of imported parts essential for assembling an electric vehicle (EV),” he says.

Instead of focusing on promoting impractical imports, the government should incentivise local innovation

Although to resolve some issues, the government made policies to smooth imports and incentivise manufacturers, having a fancy written document is not enough.
In 2019, the government announced the National Electric Vehicle Policy, incentivising manufacturing by bringing down the general sales tax to one per cent, lowering electricity tariffs for the users and offering more subsidies to meet a target of selling 30pc EVs by 2030. But pointing towards the trade deficit and import ban, manufacturers and assemblers raise their concerns about the effectiveness of the policy.
“We are grateful for the policy, but if there is a ban on imports overall, we cannot import at any cost, and that makes the EV market unsustainable,” says Mr Khursheed.
Another important step taken by the government this year was in April 2023, when Ishaq Dar announced the Prime Minister’s Youth Business and Agriculture Interest-free Loan Scheme aiming to give loans on two-three-wheeler EVs of up to 0.5 million in three years.
It initially targeted loans for 15,000 bikes and set a target of 60,000 bikes by 2024 and 100,000 bikes by 2025. Even though the loan scheme sounds promising for a cleaner future, its practical implication is much more complicated.
“An average Pakistani cannot afford a loan of up to 0.5m. Bike and rickshaw owners would be reluctant to pay 13,000 a month for three years to the government under this scheme when their fuel cost is less than that,” says Dr Aazir Anwar Khan, director of the Integrated Engineering Centre of Excellence at the University of Lahore.
“Hypothetically, the path is smooth for manufacturers and consumers, but practically there are a lot of issues. For example, a rickshaw of Rs1m was launched last week, which raises the question of whether anyone would buy it. Can even a single rickshaw driver afford it?” he added.
The practical implication of these kinds of policies is ambiguous. It is uncertain whether EVs will become accessible and available for consumers in the near future. There are cheaper options, like retrofitting the older bikes into electric ones, but no clear policy regarding them exists.
“With the current scheme of 15,000 vehicles a year, the question remains whether we have the demand, budget or capacity to import 40-50 bikes a day,” said Dr Khan.
Innovation versus imports
“Importing vehicles alone is not enough. If we want to create a stronger market, we urgently need to innovate, engage engineers and try to build things locally,” says Waqar, a young engineer in mechatronics. Currently working at a lab at the University of Lahore, he has been developing electric vehicles for four to five years.
The transition towards electric vehicles is not about importing vehicles from China and selling them; rather, it gives us a chance to develop the electric auto industry from scratch. “We need a budget for innovation; we need to engage the thousands of unemployed engineers and build our things,” he says.
According to the data from the Engineering Development Board, there are 22-23 EV companies registered in Pakistan, and all of them are importing their vehicles or parts to assemble from China.
“There is a difference between innovation and trading,” adds the chairman of Dice Foundation, Dr Khurshid Qureshi, who built Pakistan’s first indigenous electric vehicle. They launched a prototype in August 2022 called Nur E 75 to bring it to the market in a year or two.
“We have been importing for the last 75 years. Electric vehicles are giving us a chance to innovate and develop locally produced items that are sustainable in the longer run. It is stupidity not to avail this chance of strengthening our domestic industry,” he said. It is high time that the government gives seed money and opportunities to the scientific minds rotting in Pakistan.
Most of the institutions that are innovating EVs remain unnoticed by the media and government because they do not spend millions on marketing.
“Every time the government introduces a new policy, there are suddenly four to five EV startups ready to import vehicles, which is good. But if all of them are focused on importing and selling them at high prices, when will we capitalise on the opportunity for indigenous solutions or innovation,” concluded Dr Khan.

3,Tackling the crisis creatively,"Upcoming polls may not bring political stability due to persisting stagflation, absence of national consensus on charters of economy, governance.","Amidst the worsening crises, the national search for remedies has intensified. However, the views about the future economic and political outlook and the possible correction course diverge widely as imponderable uncertainties continue to navigate virtually a rudderless ship.
Nonetheless, what may appear a confusing debate is rooted in ground realities. The solutions offered are of short-, medium-, long-term durations, while not always immune from conflicting interests.
The important thing is that the debate is also generating a breath of fresh air — some creative ideas that can bring a culture change in the country’s mode of governance, public service delivery, and better utilisation of natural and abundant human resources for socio-economic development.
Let us take first the optimistic view that the situation may improve incrementally here and there with no fundamental or meaningful changes, at least in the short to medium–term.

The next polls may not bring political stability because of persisting stagflation and the absence of national consensus on charters of economy and governance

This view gains currency from the after-tax earnings of the corporate sector recorded at Rs877.6 billion in the first nine months of the current fiscal year, up 8.8 per cent from a year ago. The data compiled and its analysis carried out by Arif Habib Ltd is based on the results of 89 of the top 100-listed companies, representing 93.1pc of the stock market’s capitalisation.
And official figures show that the direct tax collection shot up by 44pc to Rs2.5 trillion during 10 months of FY23, as compared to the same period of the last fiscal year. An analyst described it as the only success story in the domain of tax collection.
Bankers and currency dealers expect remittances for April at $2.5bn to help post a current account surplus for the second month in a row. But remittances declined by 10.8pc in the first nine months of the current fiscal year.
The trade deficit fell by 39.62pc to $23.71bn during 10 months of FY23 as compared to the same period last fiscal year. Imports of merchandise plunged by 28.44pc to $46.88b, however, exports also dropped by 11.71pc to $23.71bn. But ‘public debt risks remains high’ says the Economic Advisory Wings of the Ministry of Finance.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that the government’s interest payments will increase to Rs5.5tr in the current fiscal year against the earlier estimate of Rs3.9tr. An analyst says this means that the State Bank of Pakistan policy rate would remain very high. To be successful over the long term, say researchers, a country must earn an amount that is at least equal to what it spends.
Judging by one year’s performance of the PDM government and persisting long-term macroeconomic imbalances, many see the political economy remaining stuck in a quagmire.
PML-N leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi says it was impossible to deliver on promises within the current system of governance, and it needs to be ‘redefined.’
“We need a 360-degree rethink of industry, trade, taxation, monetary and fiscal policies.’ says Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry President Irfan Iqbal Sheikh, describing the country’s short-term economic scenario as ‘extremely volatile, rickety, and uncertain.’
Bank credit to the private sector dropped to Rs229.92bn from July to April compared to Rs1.19tr of nine and a half months last fiscal year.
On the other hand, bank financing to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has simultaneously ballooned to Rs249bn from Rs12bn. Pakistan’s SOEs, notes a World Bank report, are the worst in South Asia, and their losses are growing faster than their assets. This is making privatisation more difficult.
Owing to precarious foreign exchange reserves position and curbs on dollar movements, foreign companies’ outflow of profits and dividends during July-May have plummeted 86.6pc to $233bn as against $1.2bn a year ago.
We are not immune from international banking trends. Only hours after the First Republic Bank was rescued by JPMorgan Chase, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said she expects more weaknesses to be exposed in the banking sector. Joseph Stiglitz says supervisory failures worsened the financial turmoil triggered by rapid interest rate hikes.
We are seeing somewhat similar ‘rescue’ operations in Pakistan. UAE investor Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah has raised his shareholding to 51pc and acquired management control of the Summit Bank by injecting Rs10bn fresh equity. JS Bank is reported to have moved closer to acquiring a 24.88pc shareholding of BankIslami Pakistan. United Bank says it is ’exploring a potential merger with Silk Bank.
A segment of the business community believes that the political situation will be in focus until the general elections take place. Disagreeing, certain analysts do not see the next polls bringing political stability in view of persisting stagflation and the absence of national consensus on charters of economy and governance.
It is common values and aspirations that build trust, cooperation and social cohesion, which are critical factors for the country’s economic and social development, says an eminent development economist. But here, power politics are a major hurdle.
Asked about the current crisis at the launching of his book titled ‘Pakistan: Origins, Identity and Future’, its well-known author Pervez Hoodbhoy said: ‘the system is about to change and collapse because no one wants to give us loans.’
Large and widening wealth gaps tend to lead to periods of greater conflict, especially when economic conditions become bad and people are fighting over a shrinking pie, says Ray Dalio, author of the book ‘Principles for the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail.’

4,Soaring towards aviation growth,"According to IATA, aviation industry contributes approximately $2.7tr to the world’s GDP and supports 65.5m jobs globally."," 


In today’s world, the quintessential boosters of a country’s economy are the three Ts, namely, trade, travel and tourism. Intuitively, these three Ts are also the pillars for the sustenance of the aviation industry of a country. And interestingly, the relationship between the growth in aviation and the growth in the economy is bidirectional. If one grows, the other also gets a boost.
Commercial aviation has become an essential part of our everyday lives, connecting people, goods, and businesses around the world. The aviation industry has grown significantly over the years, and its contribution to the global economy is immense.
It has been proven time and again that there is a statistically significant, positive correlation between the growth of aviation and a country’s economy. It is further established that the significance of aviation-specific education cannot be over-emphasised for sustained growth of a country’s commercial aviation.
The aviation industry has grown rapidly in the past few decades, contributing significantly to the growth of the global economy.

According to the International Air Transport Association, the aviation industry contributes approximately $2.7tr to the world’s GDP and supports 65.5m jobs globally

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry contributes approximately $2.7 trillion to the world’s GDP and supports 65.5 million jobs worldwide.
The aviation industry plays a critical role in facilitating the movement of goods and people. It enables businesses to access global markets.
Additionally, the aviation industry drives tourism, as travellers utilise air transport to experience different resorts in various parts of the world, meet people, and observe cultures and traditions. The tourism sector contributes significantly to the growth of the economy, and the aviation industry plays a key role in promoting it.
Moreover, the aviation industry has a spillover effect on other sectors of the economy. For example, the development of airports creates employment opportunities for various professionals, such as engineers, architects, managers, security personnel, and business entrepreneurs.
Also, the aviation industry drives innovation, leading to the development of new technologies that can be utilised in other sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing.
The growth of the aviation industry is dependent on a skilled workforce. Aviation-specific education provides individuals with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in the aviation industry.
The aviation industry is diverse, ranging from pilots, air traffic controllers, ground staff, maintenance engineers, admin personnel, and aviation managers. Aviation-specific education ensures that professionals in these sectors are proficient in their respective roles.
Aviation-specific education provides individuals with a broad understanding of the aviation industry, including its history, regulations, and operational requirements.
For instance, a degree in Aeronautical Engineering provides individuals with specialised knowledge related to aircraft design, maintenance, and repair, while a degree or certificate in Aviation Management is essential for managing aviation-related business domains.
Aviation marketing, supply chain, aviation finance, safety, security, aviation economics, and other administrative skills are essential for effectively managing airports, airlines, general aviation and ground support services.
Moreover, aviation-specific education ensures that professionals in the aviation industry are up to date with the latest technological advancements. The aviation industry is constantly evolving, and professionals need to possess the skills and knowledge required to operate in this dynamic environment.
For instance, air traffic controllers need to be proficient in the use of advanced technological equipment utilised in controlling air traffic. Familiarity, knowledge and application of new technologies are often a requirement for most jobs in the aviation sector.
The role of government in promoting aviation and aviation-specific education is significant. Here are a few ways in which governments can promote aviation and aviation-specific education:
Investment in Infrastructure: Govern­ments can invest in building and maintaining airports, air traffic control systems, and other related infrastructure. This can facilitate the growth of the aviation industry and create more job opportunities.
Regulation: Governments play a crucial role in regulating the aviation industry to ensure safety and security. This includes setting standards for aircraft maintenance, pilot training, air traffic control, and airport security.
Subsidies and tax incentives: Govern­ments can offer subsidies and tax incentives to encourage airlines to operate in their country. This can lead to increased competition, lower fares, and improved connectivity.
Education and Training: Governments can promote aviation-specific education and training programmes to develop a skilled workforce for the aviation industry. This can include programmes that provide technical training for pilots, air traffic controllers, aviation managers, and maintenance technicians.
Research and Development: Govern­ments can fund research and development in aviation technology to promote innovation and improve safety and efficiency.
The wheel that churns the country’s economy gets its impetus from the government’s effective role, ie, involvement in building the infrastructure, subsidies for deserving students, promoting aviation-specific education, making congenial policies, and creating an aviation-friendly environment that promotes aviation-specific education, and provides investor-friendly regulations, taxes, and duties.
As aviation grows, skilled human resources are gainfully engaged, and aviation becomes a sustainable growth and prosperity contributor for the country. The end result is that the economy starts flying in tandem with aviation and attains heights hitherto unknown.

7,Supporting mango exports,"Markets such as the EU and UK offer higher profitability but only through compliance with international standards, TDAP official says.","The Trade Development Authority Pakistan (TDAP) seeks to improve the export of quality mangoes to increase its share in the global high-end market.
To this end, TDAP has initiated mango bagging under a pilot project in Pakistan’s two main mango-producing districts in Sindh and Punjab.
It seeks to ensure uniformity in size, colour and fruit shape to have premium quality mango with cosmetic appeal.
Around 10 farms have been selected in Sindh’s districts and 15 in Multan, where the project is underway. Unripe mangoes are bagged in a few lower-Sindh mango farms of progressive mango producers in Tando Allahyar.

Markets such as the EU and the UK offer higher profitability but only through compliance with international standards

“Apart from the traditional industries, there are sectors that have huge scope for export, and agriculture is one of them. The government will benefit from increased foreign exchange, and growers from better profitability if the quality of the mango is ensured”, opines TDAP secretary Dr Farid Iqbal Qureshi. He refers to last year’s mango export to Kazakhstan which fetched $36 million.
TDAP has provided paper bags which were porous in nature. Owners of selected farms are supposed to use them to protect mangoes against insects and abrasion, thus preserving their cosmetic value. The bags serve as physical barriers for fruit flies as well.
These are one of the many social compliances and certifications needed for accessing formal high-end markets in the European Union, United Kingdom etc. In contrast, Pakistani mangoes mostly end up in Middle Eastern countries’ ethnic markets. The share of exports in total exports is less than six per cent, which could be enhanced, TDAP official says.
“We do not generally comply with the standards of formal markets abroad. The unavailability of efficient and supportive infrastructure is another stumbling block to enabling mango export to supermarkets, as 70pc of the customers in the EU and the UK buy fruit from these markets.
“We have to first ensure mangoes are healthy, disease- and pest-free with lesser cosmetic issues if we aim to grab high-end markets although the opportunity is wide open for us,” says Mahmood Nawaz Shah, whose farm was selected for bagging mangoes.
He appreciates that TDAP is intervening in the horticulture sector and hopes this would payoff to improve fruit exports to desired destinations.
“Growers avoid getting certifications because of the higher fee structure. As they get an equal return in the market, even after being certified, they see no reason to acquire it. To encourage them towards exports, TDAP, to begin with, may absorb part of the certification fees as a subsidy,” he says.
He says the infrastructure at airports is not supportive towards facilitating the export of quality mangoes to high-end markets.
TDAP officials concede that in the absence of compliance with standards, Pakistani mangoes from Sindh and Punjab don’t fetch the prices that they otherwise would. The authority aims to create awareness among mango producers about required export conditions.
For bagging purposes, TDAP imported the paper to cover unripe mangoes in trees in envelopes. The paper could have been arranged locally as cement companies use it for packing.
If these measures produce good results this year, mango producers will be more inclined to follow them. TDAP’s agriculture consultant, Dr Mubarak Ahmad, points out that the authority will hopefully promote the mango bagging initiative at a bigger scale next year with certain allocations for farmers’ bags if this step shows reasonable impact. “TDAP will connect growers with exporters. Otherwise, the effort will dwindle away,” he says.
Regrettably, Sindh has an unimpressive number of Global GAP (good agricultural practices) certified mango growers: Ghulam Sarwar Abro, Mahmood Nawaz Shah, Junaid Hyder Shah and Syed Zain Shah. Initially, there were eight, but some lost interest for one or the other reason.
Some of these farmers have successfully exported mangoes to Belgium, Netherlands and the UK, though for a limited time, after US Agency for Inter­national Development’s intervention at selected farms, leading to the establishment of pack houses.
“Our experience shows qualitative expectations of consumers are higher in markets of value where customers pay more for quality and duly processed fruit,” says Mr Shah. In developed countries, customers are always keen to know the traceability and origin of the fruit. They want very minute details of fruit processing and packaging, he explains.
Since certifications and compliances remain cumbersome and most farmers avoid it, they remain satisfied with dumping their mangoes locally or in the Middle East only to get lower prices. On the other hand, mango crops often fall prey to various pests and diseases that cause considerable production losses during flowering and fruit-setting seasons.
To overcome weaknesses in the mango industry, TDAP intends to sponsor doctoral studies in the mango sector and select teachers from Nawaz Sharif University Multan and Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) Tandojam equally to have quality research and ensure the studies’ usefulness for benefiting exports.
This happened again this year too. Sindh’s mango crop was affected by malformation and hopper, which damaged the crop. Malformation remains contagious with no immediate treatment.
Sindh Horticulture Research Centre (SHRC) survey noted that the crop was hit by hoppers (pest) and malformation. It was visible in Tando Allahyar, which is a second home to mangoes after Mirpurkhas, the hub of Sindhri mangoes.
He attributed malformation to unusually lower temperatures in February when trees need temperatures between 15-24 degrees Celsius. Many orchards don’t get aeration and sunlight, which are vital for trees to bear healthy fruit. Orchards where trees get aeration and sunlight were not affected, he says.
Owners who sprayed crops in January and used fungicides in November were better able to have their fruits. “We believe yields in orchards will be affected,” he fears.
Growers feel that the unending disease pattern shows much-needed research interventions that are lacking in Sindh, which worries mango producers.
“While TDAP’s initiative for producing quality mango is good, the main problem is the diseases that affect mango trees almost every year.

TCF and Citi partnership
The Citizens Foundation (TCF) and the Citi Foundation expanded their partnership for the sixth year to implement the ‘21st Century Employability and Digital Skills for the Youth Programme’, as per a press release. Under the collaboration, Citi Foundation provided a one-year grant of $175,000 to support the continuity of quality intermediate learning for TCF college students to help them transition to tertiary education and build technical skills. Citi Foundation has helped impact the lives of over 1,100 youths. 
Secondary students from low-income families in Pakistan face immense barriers to transition to intermediate and tertiary education because of irregular classes in government institutions and the unaffordability of expensive tutoring and transportation. 
In addition to a rigorous academic curriculum, TCF College offers its students 200 hours of self-development programmes to build and enhance critical technical skills needed in today’s job market. It also organises year-round activities and workshops to enrich students’ learning experiences.

9,CORPORATE WINDOW: The mirage of good news,Industry performance in next fiscal year depends mostly on the environment in which general elections are held and who comes into power.,"Here is good news! Corporate earnings in the first nine months of this fiscal year remained robust despite flat economic growth, according to a recent Dawn report based on data compiled by Arif Habib Ltd.
Combined earnings of the representative firms of corporate Pakistan rose 8.8 per cent year-on-year to Rs877.6 billion during July 2022-March 2023. The annual increase in after-tax profit in January-March 2023 was even higher — 12.7pc.
While this development is reassuring and reflects the resilience of Pakistan’s corporate sector, policymakers in the country and the private sector need to work harder to sustain the trend. That’s not going to be a walk in the park.
April-June 2023 corporate earnings may not show as promising growth as in the last quarter, reflecting the effect of the heightened political/constitutional crisis. And the performance of the corporate sector in the next fiscal year, beginning in July, depends mostly on the environment in which general elections are held and who comes into power.

Industry performance in the next fiscal year depends mostly on the environment in which general elections are held and who comes into power

It also depends on what kind of FY24 budget the incumbent PDM-led federal coalition government presents in June — and what happens to the provincial budgets of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The caretakers in these two provinces have outlived their Constitutional tenures.
And the Election Commission of Pakistan and the Parliament do not want to hold elections there earlier than the next general elections as per the Supreme Court’s orders.
According to Arif Habib Ltd., growth in corporate earnings during July-March FY23 was driven by the banking, oil and gas exploration, cement and chemicals sectors. And the sectors that reported aggregate losses were fertiliser, oil and gas marketing, refineries, automobile and steel making/engineering.
Growth in Pakistan’s banking sector’s earnings often comes with a heavy price for the economy. During July-March FY23, the banking sector’s profitability was driven extensively by banks’ excessive lending to the cash-strapped federal government, which effectively means lower bank financing for the private sector. Pakistan’s economy had expanded by 6pc in FY22, but FY23 growth is estimated at 0.5pc only.
This economic slowdown, too, naturally depressed the demand for private-sector credit. So, it is natural for banks to invest excessively in government debt papers, particularly when interest rates are at the highest-ever levels.
But generally, banks in Pakistan are too choosy in lending to the private sector and shy away from penetrating deeper into the credit market with suitable financial products for micro, small and medium enterprises.
In nine months and three weeks of this fiscal year, the private sector’s borrowings totalled just Rs232bn, but the federal government borrowed a whopping Rs 2.805 trillion from banks, according to the State Bank of Pakistan.
The 8.8pc rise in overall corporate earnings seen in nine months of this fiscal year should lead to an 8-9pc full-year increase in earnings even if April-June 2023 losses of some of the already stressed sectors grow. But sustaining this growth trend in FY24 will be challenging.
We must not forget that the FY23 increase in corporate profitability has originated in large part due to 6pc GDP growth a year earlier. That high growth played a key role in keeping a large part of aggregate demand alive in FY23 and retained earnings of the corporate sector accumulated in FY22 helped them a lot in a much tighter monetary environment and low private sector credit disbursement. These two factors will not be in play in the next fiscal year.
The central bank’s policy rate, already at an all-time high of 21pc, may go further up as headline inflation remains at a 59-year high of 36.4pc. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is also pressing for further monetary tightening disregarding concerns that further rate hikes will harm economic growth.
Besides, in FY24, the government will have to increase its borrowing from banks as the fiscal deficit is projected to peak at 8.3pc of GDP from an estimated 6.8pc in FY23. In the best-case scenario, projected by the IMF, Pakistan’s economy will grow by 3.5pc in the next fiscal year.
This much growth (coming in the wake of only 0.5pc expansion in this fiscal year) would be insufficient to help the corporate sector fare too strongly next year, more so if the country does not get out of the current political/constitutional crisis.
The corporate sector should not hope for something big in the FY24 budget either. The budget is being prepared under the scrutiny of the IMF, whose ultra-harsh conditions do not leave any room for the government to offer any big incentive to the corporate, or to any other sector for that matter.
Besides, this year’s excessive domestic and external borrowings of the government are likely to expand the debt-servicing cost to Rs5.3tr against the budgeted estimate of Rs3.95tr.
Whether corporate earnings maintain the current trend of increase in profitability — and to what extent tax evasions and leakages in revenue collection can be plugged — will be crucial for tax-revenue generation in the coming fiscal year. And that, in turn, may have a decisive impact on how the government and the public sector together will contribute to national prosperity. Let’s hope for the best, but let’s be prepared for the worst.
Meanwhile, it is good and reassuring to learn that some top-tier members of corporate Pakistan, including some multinational companies, are pressing the government and the private sector for wage reforms.
In a recent round-table dialogue in Karachi, they proposed that “minimum wages” be replaced with “fair living wages”. They called upon all the stakeholders to increase the current Rs25,000 per month minimum wage to Rs50,000 per month fair living wage. One hopes the government and the private sector heed the call and find practical ways of implanting this noble idea.

10,Car consumerism,"According to a survey conducted by Gallup & Gillani last year, 93pc Pakistanis report they do not have a car at their home."," 

Source: Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association

Standing at a signal in Karachi’s Defence area, one wonders whether the country is in a crisis or not. There is a Vigo on one side, a Hilux in front, two Civics behind and a Mercedes that can be seen through the rearview mirror. There is no shortage of vehicles with an eight-figure price tag in the city.
Over the last two decades, car sales have increased almost five times, but tractor sales have increased by 115pc. One could argue that with increased industrialisation and a shift towards the services sector, the need for tractors has decreased. However, according to World Bank data, agriculture’s share in Pakistan’s GDP has not materially changed since 1999, when it was 25pc, to 2021 when it was 23pc.
The explosion of car ownership is limited to a few hands. According to a survey conducted by Gallup & Gillani last year, 93pc Pakistanis report they do not have a car in their home. These results are similar to the Pakistan Social and Living Standard Measurement survey (2019-20), which states that only 6pc of Pakistanis claim car ownership.
Economics dictates that what is demanded will be supplied. The status-conscious consumerism-driven elite have a penchant for impractically big cars which is why finding parking has become a nightmare. And the rich do not care about food security beyond a glance at the headlines and writing of cheques to favoured charities.
Tractors, even with 90pc localisation rate, are much lower in demand. Farmers that bemoan the high price of fertilisers and basic farm inputs will have little left to invest in agricultural mechanisation.
Preparing land is labour-intensive and is usually the first activity to be mechanised. While in advanced economies such as the US, the one-man-one-tractor paradigm is being broken as single operators manage an entire fleet of self-driving tractors, primitive ways of agriculture are still being practised in many parts of Pakistan.
Over the years, there have been attempts by the government to increase access to tractors through schemes such as the Benazir Tractor Scheme and the Kamyab Kisan Programme. However, many small farmers opt to rent tractors or do without as they do not have the purchasing power to acquire farm machinery.
Small farm landholdings, which comprise the bulk of the agriculture sector, also make mechanisation unviable due to lack of scale, trapping the rural poor in the vicious cycle of poverty. Politics play a role as well. The feudal lords drive their Prado but prefer to do without tractors to employ more farm hands and thus strengthen their vote bank.
The rise of cars but comparatively limited growth in tractors indicates the country’s priorities.

11,Data points,"As consumers grow increasingly conscious of the environmental toll of plastic packaging, many brands have taken steps to","Superfluous packaging
As consumers grow increasingly conscious of the environmental toll of plastic packaging, many brands have taken steps to reduce their use of plastic. But at the same time, some brands have adopted a much less productive approach to the anti-plastic movement: adding superfluous paper packaging on top of plastic packaging to make their products look more environmentally friendly — without actually reducing plastic waste. Research found that this sort of overpackaging can indeed be effective in boosting consumers’ perceptions of sustainability, despite the fact that it is demonstrably worse for the environment (not to mention more expensive for manufacturers). However, they also found that simply adding a “minimal packaging” label to plastic packages can reduce the misperception that overpackaged products are more sustainable, enabling brands to attract environmentally-conscious consumers without creating unnecessary paper waste.

End of the tech boom
As the market downturn drags on and investor cash remains hard to come by, more startups will start to run out of money, experts say. Some venture-backed companies will be forced to raise new funding even if it means agreeing to a lower valuation than they once secured, a deal called a down round, dreaded by founders and investors alike. Founders assiduously avoid down rounds because they signal that a company’s to-the-moon trajectory has been derailed, battering morale and wiping out millions, and sometimes billions, of paper wealth for startup founders and employees. Yet ask most tech industry professionals, and they will grimly confirm that such deals are becoming inevitable.

Steep payments and repairs
Cars are staying on the road longer, reaching an age where they need substantial repairs or break down. It is a key reason more people are falling behind on their auto loans. The trend, noted by lenders, consumer attorneys and others, is another example of the long-lasting effects of the pandemic, which transformed the auto industry by making new and lightly used vehicles hard to come by. Some lenders are getting spooked, tightening their standards so that drivers who want to buy older vehicles have fewer options for getting financing. Americans who already were discouraged by the rapid increase in car prices over the past few years could have an even harder time finding a car they can afford, or one that won’t guzzle up their savings after they buy it. Many consumers already struggled to pay the large car loans they took out to buy vehicles after prices surged in 2021 and early 2022. They are less likely to keep paying if they also have to foot steep bills to keep the cars on the road.

Same story in Bolivia
There is no shortage of dollars,” announces a banner on the homepage of Bolivia’s central bank. “Our economy is strong, solvent and stable.” The need for the post suggests otherwise. For the past few weeks, Bolivians have desperately been trying to buy dollars. Investors are spooked. Government bonds maturing in 2028 have lost nearly half their value since January. The dollar shortage is partly a result of tighter global financial markets. When the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates last year, it became harder for Bolivia to take on foreign debt. Then came the war in Ukraine, and the annual cost of importing fuel doubled to more than $4bn (or 10pc of GDP). Though the country’s dollar shortage was exacerbated by short-term problems, it has been long in the making.

17,Going vertical,"A normal sector in Islamabad, having hardly 0.1m people, can accommodate a million if developed as a high-rise housing cluster.","The area of Islamabad is roughly 900 square kilometres, and its population is about 1.3 million. In comparison, Singapore has an area of little more than 700sqkm and a population of 5.5m million which is more than four times that of Islamabad. 
Built-up land in Singapore is not more than 40 per cent of the island’s total land. So, they have cramped 5.5m people in under 350 sq km with the best public services in the world. How did they do it? 
The simple answer is they are going vertical to save precious land. More than 75pc of the population of Singapore lives in high-rise towers. 
Vertical housing can be good for Pakistan for several reasons. Pakistan is a rapidly urbanising country with a large and growing urban population. As cities become more crowded, there is an increasing demand for housing that can accommodate a growing number of people in limited space. 
High-rise buildings are an efficient way to provide housing for a large number of people in a smaller area, reducing the pressure on land and resources. 

A normal sector in Islamabad, where hardly a hundred thousand people live, can accommodate a million people if developed as a high-rise housing cluster

In densely populated cities where land is at a premium, building vertically allows more people to live in a smaller area. This not only helps to reduce urban sprawl but also minimises the environmental impact of construction, as fewer resources are required to build and maintain a high-rise building compared to multiple low-rise structures.
Vertical housing can be a more affordable option for many people, particularly in high-cost urban areas where the cost of living can be prohibitively high. By sharing the cost of amenities and maintenance with other residents, living in a high-rise building can be more cost-effective than owning a single-family home. The same is true for Pakistan. 
Vertical housing has the potential to save agricultural land by reducing urban sprawl and allowing more people to live in smaller areas. As urban populations continue to grow, there is increasing pressure on agricultural land, which is often converted into residential and commercial areas to accommodate the needs of the expanding city. 
One advantage of vertical housing is that it allows more people to live in a smaller area, which can help to reduce the overall demand for public services like water and transportation. For example, a high-rise building with 100 units would require less land, water, and transportation infrastructure than 100 single-family homes spread out over a large area. 
Moreover, vertical housing can be designed to incorporate sustainable technologies like rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling, which can help reduce the demand for freshwater and lower the cost of water services.
Additionally, high-rise buildings can be located in areas with good public transportation infrastructure, or new public transport can be planned to pass through high-rise housing clusters reducing the need for residents to own cars and the cost of providing transportation services. The same will be true for other essential public services like health, education, and waste management.
Moreover, vertical housing can promote sustainable living by encouraging residents to use public transportation, walk or bike to work, and reduce their carbon footprint. This can help to reduce the overall demand for land needed to make roads, leading to less pressure on forest land and other natural resources.
Pakistan is a country hard hit by climate change, and a move to sustainable living can save future generations. Vertical living clusters with all the basic amenities provided at the same place can greatly reduce people’s need to travel, thus reducing their need to have cars. This will, in turn, help minimise never-ending traffic congestion on roads, reduce fuel import bills and generate many other positive externalities. 
Our civic agencies, like Capital Development Authority, Lahore Development Authority, Karachi Development Authority and many others, need to change the way they think of urban development. For 75 years, their vision for development has revolved around making underpasses, flyovers and bypass roads on one side and separating living and commercial areas on the other.
This approach has only worsened housing, traffic and public services in our major cities. It is difficult to understand why these civic agencies have made two-story houses a part of their faith which they are not willing to violate at any cost. 
A normal sector in Islamabad, where hardly a hundred thousand people live, can accommodate a million people if developed as a high-rise housing cluster.
The time has come in Pakistan to go vertical to save our environment and precious agricultural land and to provide better public services to a large chunk of the population. We need to reimagine our cities as clean and hassle-free economic hubs, and for this purpose, we do not need to reinvent the wheel; we just need to fly to Singapore or some other live-able city to see the urban wheel. 
It will be better to staff our urban policy-making bodies with people specialising in sustainable urban management, smart city researchers and urban economists instead of career bureaucrats.
