0,"Election within 90 days is duty, not choice: CJP","""When it comes to constitutional enforcement, we must not blink our eyes,"" Justice Bandial says.","• Says ‘we must not blink’ on constitutional enforcement
• States if a verdict is not challenged, then it becomes final
• Stresses all citizens have equal rights, pays tribute to former top judge Justice Cornelius
LAHORE: The Consti­tution calls for elections within 90 days after the assemblies are dissolved and leaves no choice for a delay, Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial said on Sunday, as the judiciary and the government continue to lock horns over when polls should be held in Punjab.
“When it comes to constitutional enforcement, we must not blink our eyes,” Justice Bandial said at a conference on minority rights in Lahore. “If it says 90 days for holding elections, it is our duty to say that and not our choice, instead of finding a reason why we should avoid saying that.”
His remarks follow an order by the Supreme Court asking the government to hold elections in Punjab on May 14 — a delay of one month from the Constitution-mandated time, as the provincial assembly was dissolved in mid-January.
And a further delay is possible if the government and the opposition PTI manage to reach a consensus. An earlier round of talks produced no results.
For now, the government is still baulking at the idea of holding polls in one or two provinces before the general election and wants simultaneous voting across the country, sometime in October.
This has been vehemently opposed by the PTI and it petitioned the Supreme Court, which is set to resume a hearing in the case on Monday (today).
In his address, Justice Bandial regretted that the matter was being called a “controversy”. He said: “I’m sorry, I’m not worthy of controversy.”

And as the PTI has started rallies in solidarity with the chief justice, Justice Bandial told the audience: “Please don’t say that you support us. I’m just one of the members of the Supreme Court. You must support the Supreme Court if you stand up for the law and the Constitution and not [for] any individual.”
He said the Supreme Court and its judges had no existence individually but “as a unit [and] as a constitutional organ and that is how we function”.
“The important thing is when the Supreme Court speaks on merit, then its judgement has moral authority. That becomes even more important when those judgements are not appealed or no review is filed, then that means no one has any objection to the judgement.
“If a review is filed, then it will be heard because no judgement is binding unless it becomes final. But if a judgement is not challenged, then it becomes final, so let’s see what happens now,” he said.
 
 

The chief justice said he was “optimistic” that the nation’s leaders, institutions and people were all “committed to the Constitution”.
Referring to negotiations between the government and the PTI, he said the apex court was informed that they had yet to conclude.
“We have nothing to do with that, but at least they are conscious that they have a duty to comply [with] the Constitution and we are there to support that effort otherwise our judgement is there, it has a force of its own, it may not be implemented today but it will last to the test of time and shall be implemented tomorrow,” he said.
Minority rights
Earlier, speaking on the event’s theme, Justice Bandial paid tribute to Justice Alvin Robert Cornelius, who served as the chief justice of Pakistan from 1960 to 1968.
He said Justice Cornelius gave 17 years to the Supreme Court and his life was an example for the judges because when he retired, he had no assets in the country.
Recalling some of Justice Cornelius’ famous decisions, Justice Bandial said the late judge declared the governor general’s dissolution of the assembly as illegal, arguing that the executive officer could not decide the fundamental rights.
Similarly, when two provinces banned Jamaat-i-Islami in 1964, Justice Cornelius lifted the ban, saying it was a matter of basic human rights, Justice Bandial said.
Justice Bandial told participants that the Constitution assured freedom to profess religion and manage religious institutions subject to public order and morality.
“Our Constitution in Article 21 safeguards against the taxation of any particular religion. So, for no particular reason can other religions be taxed,” he said. “Article 22 safeguards educational institutions in respect of religion. No religious instruction or ceremony in any educational institution other than one’s own religion.”
The chief justice added that no citizen could be denied admission to educational institutions, which received aid from public revenues, on the grounds of caste, race, religion, or place of birth.
“Our Constitution says everyone is free to profess their religion, and all citizens have equal rights and yet for years our minorities have felt discriminated, marginalised and sidelined,” he said.

1,"Focus on ‘security’ in COAS meetings with Chinese, Afghan FMs",Gen Munir reiterates the need for full support from Afgha­nistan’s interim govt in matters of mutual interest.,"ISLAMABAD: Army chief General Asim Munir on Sunday discussed regional security and border management mechanisms in separate meetings with the foreign ministers of China and Afghanistan.
The meetings with the top envoys of neighbouring countries came a day after Pakistan and China agreed to “work together with all stakeholders for a peaceful, stable, prosperous and united Afghanistan” after the fifth round of trilateral foreign ministers’ dialogue.
In his meeting with Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, Gen Munir stressed the need for enhanced cooperation between the two governments to effectively tackle the “common challenges of terrorism and extremism”.
He reiterated the need for full support and commitment from Afgha­nistan’s interim government in matters of mutual interest.

Bilawal holds ‘in-depth’ discussion with Muttaqi on peace, trade

The media wing of the military said that the army chief and Chinese FM Qin Gang discussed regional security, enhancing cooperation in the field of defence, and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
“[The] COAS met Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister H.E. Qin Gang at his office. Matters of mutual interest including regional security and defence cooperation came under discussion,” said the ISPR statement.
During the meeting, the army chief reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the China-Pakistan strategic relationship and pledged full support for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project — a vital component of the BRI.
Gen Munir, who visited China last month, appreciated Beijing’s unwavering support for Pakistan on regional and international issues.
Mr Qin underscored the importance of the “longstanding strategic relationship” with Pakistan and expressed “satisfaction over the progress made” on CPEC.
He also stressed China’s commitment to the timely completion of CPEC projects.
The foreign minister appreciated Pakistan’s efforts in maintaining regional peace and stability, especially the army’s support for provision of security to Chinese nationals and projects in Pakistan.
The two also discussed the evolving security situation in the region.
Gen Munir acknowledged China’s role in promoting peace and stability in the region, and both sides agreed to enhance their existing cooperation in defence and security domains to effectively counter regional security challenges.
‘Mechanism to improve security’
During his meeting with the Afghan foreign minister, the army chief discussed regional security, border management, and formalisation of bilateral mechanisms to improve the current security environment.
It may be noted that after the fall of Kabul in 2021, Pakistan has experienced a surge in cross-border attacks, mostly in tribal districts bordering Afghanistan, claimed by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
Mr Muttaqi appreciated Pakistan’s support for the people of Afghanistan and acknowledged the role that Pakistan “continues to play in facilitating peace and development” in his country.
The minister expressed his desire to “work closely with Pakistan to promote regional stability and prosperity”.
Both sides agreed on the importance of maintaining regular contact to strengthen bilateral ties and address issues of common concern.
‘Importance of trade’
Separately, Mr Muttaqi called on Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to discuss a host of issues, including peace and security and counter-terrorism. According to the Foreign Office, the meeting was held in a candid environment and an in-depth exchange on key issues of mutual concern, including peace and security, as well as trade and connectivity took place.
 






On peace and security, the foreign ministers stressed the need for enhanced coordination to counter-terrorism. Regarding bilateral and transit trade, the two sides stressed the importance of removing impediments to trade in order to advance the goal of enhanced regional economic integration and connectivity.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said he was “pleased” to host his Afghan counterpart and held a comprehensive discussion on all areas of mutual importance. “Pakistan is committed to enhancing bilateral relations in a spirit of cooperation, trust and respect,” he said, underscoring the importance of “frequent leadership-level exchanges to provide further stimulus” to bilateral relations.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari also hosted a luncheon in honour of the visiting Afghan delegation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Pictures shared by the foreign minister’s account showed State Minister for Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar was also present during the meetings.
Earlier in the day, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said it was an honour to host the foreign ministers of China and Afghanistan at the 5th China-Pak-Afghan Trilateral FMs Dialogue. “We held productive discussions on political engagement, counter-terrorism, trade, and connectivity,” he said. “I look forward to constructive engagement under a trilateral process between our three countries.”

2,"PM, Scottish leader agree to expand collaboration",LONDON: Prime Minis­ter Shehbaz Sharif met Scotland’s First Minister Humza Yousaf in London on Sun­day and...,"

LONDON: First Minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf shakes hands with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, on Sunday.—Online

 
LONDON: Prime Minis­ter Shehbaz Sharif met Scotland’s First Minister Humza Yousaf in London on Sun­day and invited him to visit Pakistan.
Mr Yousaf, who des­cribed their engagement as ‘very positive’, said: “I am grateful to him [Mr Sharif] for making time for me. I am proud of being the first Scottish Pakistani to become Scotland’s first minister, and am a son of the soil of Pakistan.
“We talked about doing more on trade, investment, education, Pakistan’s flood response and the challenge of climate change.”
He also told reporters after the meeting that there had been a major increase in the number of Pakistani students coming for higher education to Scotland.
Mr Yousaf said Scotland and Pakistan have a long tradition and history going back many years. “The prime minister extended a formal invitation for me to visit Pakistan and I will definitely come.”
When asked about the political situation in Pakis­tan, Mr Yousaf remarked, “Politics of Pakistan are for the people of Pakistan.”
The first minister expressed his gratitude to those Pakistanis who supported him, and said he got scores of messages from people in both his parents’ hometowns in Pakistan.
Mr Yousaf’s father, who was born in Mian Channu tehsil of Khanewal district, emigrated to Glasgow with his family in 1964. His mother, born in Kenya to a family of South Asian descent, also moved to Scotland in 1968 and has family in Faisalabad.
In March, Mr Yousaf became the first Scottish Pakistani and first Muslim to lead the country, after contesting a close race for the leadership of the Scottish National Party in the aftermath of Nicola Sturgeon’s resignation. His victory was hailed as a positive step by ethnic minorities in Scotland, who said it was hugely symbolic.
Prime Minister Sharif described the meeting as positive. He said Mr Yousaf was a young and energetic politician. Pakistan enjoys great relations with Britain and equally great relations with Scotland. There are over 80,000 Pakistanis in Scotland. We discussed holding a joint investment conference on how to further increase and strengthen ties, by focusing on education, trade, solar energy and investment.”
Given clean chit
Asked about the National Crime Agency’s investigation into allegations against Mr Sharif last year, the prime minister said that PTI Chairman Imran Khan used state machinery to launch a malaise case against him in the United Kingdom through the NCA but that he was given a clean chit.
The premier said the agency’s investigation spanned the UK, Dubai and Switzerland but that he was vindicated. He accused Mr Khan of wasting taxpayer money on frivolous investigations.

3,Centre may stop financing provincial projects,"Senior official says Centre is instead focusing on exports, energy, equity, e-Pakistan and environment in next year's Public Sector Deve­lopment Programme.","ISLAMABAD: Amid the tight fiscal position, the Centre is considering ending financing provincial development projects, and instead focusing on five strategic sectors — exports, energy, equity, e-Pakistan and environment (5Es) — in the next year’s Public Sector Deve­lopment Pro­gramme (PSDP).
A senior government official told Dawn that the planning and development ministry had moved a summary to the prime minister for his consent to cap the provincial development projects in the PSDP 2023-24 to be presented to parliament as part of the next year’s budget and also restrict the PSDP to 5Es.
The decision was taken at a recent meeting, presided over by Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal, with a view to moving forward to finalising the next year’s development budget with clarity after the prime minister’s consent.
PM Sharif has been given a suggestion that only those projects should be included in the PSDP which have a strategic importance and no provincial project of devolved responsibilities should be part of the PSDP, except for the projects of compelling significance which should be funded on a 50:50 basis by the Centre and provinces.
“The provincial development projects in federal PSDP should be capped forever,” the meeting concluded.
The prime minister had been given a rundown on the declining federal PSDP that dropped from about Rs1 trillion in the fiscal year 2017-18 (FY18) to about Rs480 billion in FY22 and less than Rs600bn in FY23 because of resource crunch. This was further constrained by allocation for about 16 responsibilities and ministries devolved to the provinces more than a decade ago.
“The provincial governments should now take responsibility for their subjects in their provincial annual development plans (ADPs),” the official said, quoting the summary sent to the prime minister.
The meeting also decided that the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) would entertain the projects only relating to 5Es.
The official said the planning minister would personally take up the matter with the prime minister this week and take him into confidence given the increasing demands of the coalition partners towards development priorities of their constituencies and requirements of strategic projects of national importance.
Another official was of the opinion that a representative government of major political parties maybe in a better position to reach a consensus on a national challenge like it had taken a series of tough political and economic decisions so far in the larger national interest, albeit with a substantial political cost.
Federal funding
The federal funding to provincial projects in FY22 stood at about Rs310bn which increased to about Rs330bn during the current fiscal year. It may be recalled that 16 federal ministries, along with development projects, had been devolved to the respective provinces following the 18th Constitution Amendment and abolition of Concurrent List.
The financing of projects of provincial nature was discouraged through the PSDP, except for core vertical projects of health and population till 2017. The financial burden on the federal budget, however, kept on increasing despite the fact that its fiscal share in divisible pool fell from over 57 per cent to about 45pc under the 7th National Finance Commission (NFC) award almost at the same time. The provincial projects have since then crept back into the PSDP, leaving a limited fiscal space for projects of national importance.
The PSDP 2021-22 contained about 331 projects of provincial nature worth Rs1.151tr (among 1,190 PSDP projects) and about Rs345bn had already been spent by the Centre on these projects with an allocation of Rs330bn. The Planning Commission wants these projects to be financed by the provinces themselves. It believes that because of provincial burden, the federal mega projects of national importance were suffering on account of cost overruns and delays.
The move towards capping the provincial projects from federal funding comes weeks after the World Bank suggested to the government that it should rationalise its spending by almost Rs2.5tr, starting with diversion of about Rs710bn worth of provincial project financing to federal priority areas.
Debt servicing
The government’s debt servicing cost has been rising tremendously over the years and surged past Rs3.5tr in just first nine months of the current fiscal year compared to about Rs2.1tr during the same period last year. As fiscal space reduces with limited increase in revenue collection, the axe always falls on development spending.

4,Analysis: Fate of new anti-dacoit siege hangs in the balance,"Police chief says pickets being set up on dykes; ‘unholy trio’ of cops, tribal chiefs, dacoits sows discontent among locals.","INDIGENOUS acacia trees, natural fishponds and crops dot upper Sindh’s riverine area; a picturesque landscape, which is routinely tormented by the smell of gunpowder, sounds of gunshots and sights of conflict.
The fertile land is trudged less by ploughs and more by armoured carriers. Currently, the area is bustling with police presence who are up against a well-entrenched, heavily armed and ruthless enemy — the dacoits of the katcha area.
Police have launched an operation to clear the area. As per official claims, 30 dacoits have been killed since January. Even if these numbers are to be believed, they have come at a steep cost. Several policemen, including DSP and SHOs, have also been killed by the dacoits, who operate with near impunity in the area.
Sindh has a vast riverine area. The forest department alone controls 241,198 hectares, or around 600,000 acres, of riverine forests. Besides forests, there is land owned by the revenue department and private owners. In terms of length, around 64km dyke exists in Kashmore, 40km in Sukkur, 78km in Ghotki and 38km in Shikarpur.
The Durrani Mahar police station in Kashmore, Khanpur and Garhi Tegho police posts in Shikarpur and Raunti police station in Ghotki are the bandits’ hotspots which remain a no-go area for police.

Police chief says pickets being set up on dykes; ‘unholy trio’ of cops, tribal chiefs, dacoits sows discontent among locals; force demands hi-tech gadgets

Pickets on the dykes
In this rugged terrain, the dichotomy between the police and the dacoits is glaring. While the police force is stretched to limits with limited manpower and paltry resources, dacoits are well entrenched and heavily armed.
For now, it appears that the police’s best strategy is to man the area through posts and disconnect supplies’ routes to dacoits.
Pickets are being established on the dykes in Ghotki, Shikarpur, Kashmore-Kandhkot to choke dacoits’ supply routes.
Sindh police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon believes the strategy will pay off just like it did in 1997 when he served as Ghotki SSP. “This mechanism will yield results coupled with consistent monitoring”, IG Memon expressed the hope while talking to Dawn over the phone.
But a former police officer doesn’t agree. For him, dacoits have built trenches. He says the outlaws have a bird’s eye view of policemen’s movement, hardly leaving them with a fighting chance.
“Police can’t chase the dacoits in the jungle,” said Sain Rakhio Mirani, a retired DIG who has served across Sindh.
The conditions in the riverine area have changed exceptionally in two decades, said Mr Mirani, who lives in Kashmore district, near the Durani Mahar police station — currently plagued by the dacoit factor.
“Gone are the days when police and dacoits had the same weapons. Police can’t match arms that dacoits possess as the latter use anti-aircraft guns, rocket launchers and sophisticated weapons.”
Yet, the police have decided to proceed with their plan under which pickets will be set up at a distance of 300 metres from Guddu to Sukkur barrages along the dyke.
These pickets will be powered by solar energy with round-the-clock police presence, said Ghotki SSP Tanvir Tunio, adding that 90pc of the proposed 60 pickets have already been set up. He believes this would choke the dacoits’ ammunition supply routes.
“Assault teams at selected spots will be available to respond if dacoits storm a picket. The response will be swift within five to 10 minutes,” said the SSP.
Punjab urges joint survey
The police in Punjab’s Rahim Yar Khan district also expressed willingness to support their counterparts in Ghotki for joint picketing on the dyke since the katcha starts from Punjab’s southern region and extends to Sindh. But they weren’t ready to commit anything before a joint survey to assess the vulnerabilities.
“We told the Ghotki police to go for a joint survey first given the area’s terrain and to see whether it is productive and safety of the force could be ensured or not. Otherwise, it is akin to throwing the force to wolves,” Rahim Yar Khan SSP Rizwan Umar Gondal told Dawn.
The officer believes this is an opportune time to “wipe out the dacoits” as Indus river flows are low these days.
Whether dykes are a strong enough and efficient defence against the marauding outlaws has stirred a debate.
A senior official said resource shortage wasn’t the only issue plaguing the force’s operational prowess. They also lack motivation and the cops “would look like sitting ducks” in the pickets.
“Dacoits attack in large numbers, leaving no chance for police to respond,” he told Dawn.
Police are familiar with this ruthlessness. They were at the receiving end when dacoits decided to avenge the killing of one of their own, Salto Shar.
The bandit kingpin was duped by a policeman who invited him for tea and killed him in a fake encounter in November last year, according to Mr Mirani.
The onslaught by the bandits resulted in the martyrdom of five policemen, including a DSP and two SHOs.
The situation is especially challenging in the upper Sindh region around Kashmore district, as per the police’s own admission. In the face of rampant kidnapping and lawlessness, Kashmore SSP Shabbir Sethar proceeded on a leave under immense pressure from high-ups over the prevailing situation. Local journalists say police have even stopped patrolling the highways.
The nexus
But for police, resource constraints and limited manpower are not the only struggles. The caste and tribal fault lines involved in the conflict. According to senior police officials, if a dacoit belongs to their caste, cops have a different approach while dealing with them.
There’s also a severe mistrust of the force among the locals who believe that cops work in cahoots with dacoits to deprive them of their wheat crop and expensive woods.
These claims might have some credence as there is an “unholy trio” of the police, dacoits and tribal chiefs who are all aware of each other’s indispensability.
On their part, police officers posted in the area have befriended the tribal chiefs who hobnob with dacoits to secure plush postings in return for going easy on the outlaws.
Officials believe this connivance has emboldened the dacoits.
A police chief of one of the upper Sindh districts admitted that “friendly policing” used to rule supreme till the recent past. In cases of kidnapping, the hostages were recovered through mediation and not police action. “But now we are in a fighting mood and realise there will be losses,” he said.
Tech savvy bandits
Dacoits are not only out manoeuvring the police in the field, but they are also leading the PR strategy with their efficient use of social media. To the utter chagrin of police, they post videos boasting their raids and the desertion by the police.
“Dacoits attacked the Messori picket, looted weapons and took a cop hostage, all while making videos, which went viral,” said Masood Soomro, a local journalist from Kandhkot who regularly reports on the situation.
Outside the world of social media on the battlefield, the realisation among the police is that they don’t stand a chance to win with their current resources.
The Sindh police have decided to procure hi-tech weapons and gadgets, including surveillance systems, thermal imaging devices and sniper rifles, etc at a cost of Rs2.7bn. These gadgets, according to SSP Tunio, will detect any object that has blood and will put the police in a position of advantage.
For Mr Mirani, the army and not the police are the panacea to the dacoits’ lawlessness. He said police can set up pickets but these are not the solution. “Army is the only solution. They should dismantle dacoits’ safe havens once and for all in the katcha area.”
Whether this renewed siege would yield desired results or become an addition to the litany of failed operations is yet to be seen. But for now, the two sides are entrenched in a drawn-out battle and not ready to give up.
