KARACHI: Marred by low turnout, clashes and scuffles between workers of main contesting parties and allegations of rigging mainly against the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, polling for the local government by-election in 11 union committees of Karachi was held on Sunday with people casting votes to elect their representatives.  
The polling began at 8am and continued till 5pm in a largely peaceful manner with sporadic incidents of violence and recriminations of rigging by political parties.
The turnout remained low at the start of the day, with more voters coming out of their homes as the polling neared conclusion. However, the electoral process failed to attract a large number of voters by the end of the official timing of voting. There was no official word about the turnout yet. 
There were some complaints of delay in starting of voting at some polling stations, but the timing of casting votes was not extended at any of the facilities.  
With total 6,707 policemen at security duty for all 11 UCs, situation turned tense at several polling stations where workers mainly from three contesting parties — PPP, Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) — accused each other of rigging and violence.  
In Central district’s UC-4 and UC-13 of New Karachi, the situation turned tense at the early hours of the day when workers of both the JI and the PTI gathered outside one of the polling stations and accused the activists of the rival PPP of ‘capturing’ the facility even before start of the voting process.  
The tension grew in the day when former MNA of PTI Aslam Khan claimed to have seized a number of ballot papers from ‘PPP workers’ showing votes in favour of the ruling party. The general secretary of the PTI Karachi chapter, Arsalan Taj Ghumman, took to Twitter and shared footage of ‘fake votes’ seized by the former MNA.  
Although there was no official word from police, the PTI claimed to have handed over the ‘PPP worker’ to police allegedly involved in rigging.  
In Shah Faisal Colony, clashes erupted between workers of two contesting parties after the voting was over leaving at least six people injured.  
A JI spokesman claimed that all six injured were party activists, who had been attacked by workers of the rival parties for stopping from ‘post-voting rigging’.
The city chief of JI, Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman, alleged that the PPP used government machinery and police for rigging. In his tweet, he mentioned UCs in Orangi Town, New Karachi and Korangi where the workers of the ruling party were roaming freely defying law and carrying out rigging to change the results in PPP’s favour.  
“In eight out of 11 UCs, our party is leading the count, but the PPP is using government machinery and in connivance with the polling staff is changing the results. The ECP and law-enforcement agencies have become silent spectators,” he said while addressing a press conference at Idara Noor-i-Haq after the polling time was over and the vote count was underway.  
The ruling PPP, marginally leading the January 15 polls, avoiding allegations against the rival contesting parties focused more on results of the daylong electoral exercise and claimed majority in the by-polls as well.  
Sindh Labour Minister and PPP Karachi president Saeed Ghani while sharing unofficial results on Twitter claimed to have won five UCs in Lyari, Korangi and Keamari.

3,Report sought on removal of concrete batching plants from playground,Residents move SHC against FWO for occupying a North Nazimabad park,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has summoned an official of the Frontier Works Organi­sation (FWO) along with a compliance report about removal of concrete batching plants occupying a portion of a park in North Nazimabad.  
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi said that as an indulgence, a last chance was being given to the project director of the FWO for compliance till May 11.  
A petition was filed last year contending that a park located in North Nazimabad Block L had been encroached upon as the FWO had installed batching plants and dumped other construction material on the premises of the park.  
Earlier, a lawyer for the FWO informed the court that the organisation had undertaken to vacate the public amenity park by the first week of March. However, on April 14, the lawyer for the petitioner argued that despite an undertaking given by the FWO the batching plants had not been removed yet.  
Thereafter, the bench had summoned the project director for April 26 and also directed him to do the needful before the next hearing as per undertaking and court order passed in this regard and also warned that in case of non-compliance, an appropriate order will be issued for defiance by delinquent persons.

Residents move SHC against FWO for occupying a North Nazimabad park

When the matter came up for hearing on Wednesday, the lawyer for the FWO contended that the project director was out of station and requested for a short adjournment to make compliance with the court orders.  
“As an indulgence and as a last chance we are adjourning this matter to 11th May, 2023 at 11:00am, when the concerned project director shall be present in court along with compliance,” the bench in its order said.  
On Jan 10, the FWO undertook to remove the machinery from the park while the lawyers for the petitioners argued that for the loss caused to petitioners and area people, FWO may be directed to ensure that the park at the time of vacating be brought up in a good condition.  
Subsequently, the bench had also asked the respondent to make a statement as to up-keeping of the park at the time of removing machinery.  
Impleading the Karachi Municipal Corporation, Karachi Development Authority, deputy commissioner of Central, FWO, Sindh Environmental Protection Agency and others as respondents, Mohammad Ameen Khan and four other residents of the area petitioned the SHC and submitted that the park, namely Jafico Ground located near Landi Kotal roundabout in North Nazimabad Block L, was well maintained till last year as plants, flowers and benches had been installed for area people.  
However, the petitioners argued that in September last year, the FWO had parked two dumper trucks, and dumped crush and bricks on the premises of the park on the pretext of renovation of the recreational facility.  
Thereafter, the petitioners contended that the FWO in the presence of the local administration had installed heavy machinery on a portion of the park in violation of fundamental rights of the petitioners.

4,From Turkiye with love,Four Turkish citizens are set to travel all the way to Chitral from Karachi on their motorbikes to attend Kalash Festival.,"KARACHI: Four Turks on their motorcycles are touring Pakistan these days while appreciating everything about this country they had heard so much about and wanted to visit for so long.
“This visit was very much overdue since we have toured almost all of Asia by now,” says Tankut Guzel, who entered Pakistan via the Taftan border with friend Ahmet Bati on their heavy 1,100 CC Honda Africa Twin motorbikes last week.
“Pakistan has also been on our minds since the devastating earthquake in February. First responders and social workers from here were in Turkiye to extend all kinds of help the very next day. We feel so much gratitude and love for you and your country, we just had to come,” Tankut added.
Tankut’s better half Seden Guzel and her sister Serpil Kalayci are also here. They, meanwhile, flew into Karachi. But once here they were given two brand new motorcycles, Honda 125, to borrow in order to be able to join the men on their tour of Pakistan.

Four Turkish citizens are set to travel all the way to Chitral on their motorbikes to attend Kalash Festival

The four riders belong to the Turkish Motorcycling Feder­ation. They also teach riding in Turkey. Apart from that between them they are engineers, MBAs, economists. Tankut has an MBA besides being a mechanical engineer, his wife Seden is an economist, her sister Serpil is a chemical engineer and Ahmet is an electrical and industrial engineer.
The four visitors are guests of Razi Nayyar, founder of the Motor Club of Pakistan. A huge vintage cars and heavy motorbikes enthusiast, Nayyar had also organised a tour of Turkiye and Iran back in December with other club members from Dec 17, 2015 to Jan 24, 2016.
“Altogether we had covered some 27 cities in our classic cars in Pakistan, Iran and Turkiye then,” Nayyar told Dawn.  “Our aim was to portray the country’s safe and positive image beyond the borders of Pakistan contrary to the belief around the world that Pakistan was no longer a safe country for tourism,” he added.
“So this is in fact also a return tour after your paying us a visit. That’s why we are calling it the Pakistan- Turkiye Friendship Ride,” said Tankut, who also shared their itinerary with Dawn.
From Karachi, the four riders intend to head to Chitral where they were looking forward to attending the Kalash Festival.
“We will travel from Hindukush to Karakorum, riding through the Shandur Pass, Gilgit, the Hunza Valley, the Khunjerab Pass, the main cities of Pakistan such as Islam­abad, Lahore, Bahawalpur, Multan, etc.,” Tankut shared.
“Like we are starting from Karachi, we will also be concluding the Friendship Ride in Karachi in about a month, around the first week of June,” Tankut explained. “The ladies will fly back to Turkiye while we ride back to Ankara via Balochistan, the Taftan border to enter Iran through the same Silk Route we came from,” he said.
His friend Ahmet said that before coming here they did a lot of homework. “We read up on Pakistan, and liked what we read,” he smiled. “But still we were taken a little by surprise here when we were not allowed to take the Motorway. We were informed that motorcycles are not allowed on the motorway so we had to take the National Highway where we felt a bit unsafe,” he said.
The Motor Club of Pakistan wrote to the authorities regarding the matter and are still awaiting positive response.
The two ladies are also daughters of motorbikers and off-road rally drivers. Riding is in their blood but they are glad to have taken a flight to Pakistan to join the men. “We have travelled all over the world on motorcycles and so many times we have seen so many things that we wanted to buy and take back home with us which we could not do because you can’t carry much with you on motorcycles,” laughed Seden,
“This time we will take home whatever we shop from here in our luggage,” she added.
They had already visited several markets of Karachi such as Gulf Shopping Mall in Clifton and Zainab Market in Saddar and were inquiring this scribe about the shopping centres on Tariq Road. They were already wearing some very pretty kurtis that they had bought from the Gulf Shopping Mall. Serpil, the younger of the sisters, also had her hands decorated with henna designs. “Nayyar’s daughter Rania Razi did this. Isn’t it pretty,” asked Serpil happily.
The four were also all praise for Pakistani food, their favourite being barbecue chicken paratha rolls. “We also love seekh kebab, shawarma, chicken karahi, prawn karahi, chicken tikka, Bihari boti, biryani, qeema matar, lentils and sweet and sour soup. We are trying a new dish every day here. Your food is amazing,” said the sisters almost in unison.
“We are taking pictures and making videos of everything that we like here and we intend to share it with others back home,” said Serpil.
She also added about how a well-known truck artist here, Ms Anjum Rana, painted truck art on their motorcycle cargo boxes. “The motorcycles we borrowed from here we will return of course but the cargo boxes are coming home with us,” she smiled.
Tankut cut in: “You know, in Turkiye we had heard the slogan ‘Jeevay Pakistan’. Now after coming here we are beginning to understand its true meaning, and we have not yet even embarked on the tour of the entire country as yet.”

5,Passenger narrates Red Bus ordeal,Official says Peoples Bus Service commuters can lodge official complaint regarding quality of service,"KARACHI: Although the Peoples Bus Service (PBS) has brought some relief to the Karachiites with modern buses, there are some incidents that could be avoided if the staff concerned behaved with decency with commuters. 
Sharing the details of a recent unpleasant incident on a Red Bus with Dawn, a passenger said the bus crew misbehaved with his fellow travellers when they asked the driver to open the door to get down few minutes before sunset.
“We were virtually detained inside the bus, as the driver and the other crew blatantly brushed aside the passengers’ request to open the doors,” he said.
“I was travelling along with 20 passengers via Sharea Faisal towards Tower, with around 25-30 minutes left in Iftar. The driver was steering the bus considerably sluggishly,” the passenger told this reporter. “After a while, several passengers urged the driver to accelerate a bit, but the calls fell on deaf ears,” the passenger continued.
“As the bus was nearing Shaheen Complex, a commuter pressed the door-bell button to get off. The driver not only refused to open the [automatic] door, but also rushed towards that passenger along with a person in plain clothes, and argued in a highly belligerent manner,” he detailed.

Official says Peoples Bus Service commuters can lodge official complaint regarding quality of service

“Meanwhile, another passenger bluntly asked the driver to open the door, and when the latter did not, the passenger got involved in a strong verbal spat with the bus crew.
“There was jostling and pushing [between the bus crew and some passengers] for five to seven minutes, during which the bus remained stationary at the Shaheen Complex signal, before the doors were finally opened,” he said.
According to the same person, the driver and his crew also hurled verbal threats at some passengers who had earlier objected to slow driving.
“The PBS is a good addition [by the Sindh government] to the massively suffering passengers of a mega city like Karachi. However, the quality of the service needs to be improved drastically,” the passenger emphasised. 
When approached for comments, an official of the Sindh transport department said in several similar cases fault lies on either side. 
“Generally some passengers [in our society] at times adopt impolite behaviour towards the bus crew, even on trivial matters, which sometimes results in a harsh reaction from the crew,” the official told Dawn.
“In [another] recent incident like this in Karachi, there was a university professor who had a physical altercation with PBS crtew on a minor issue. When it was brought into our knowledge, we took appropriate steps to defuse the matter which was getting serious,” he added.
When the official was told that several passengers (of the bus mentioned earlier) expressed their grievance about the highly objectionable and threatening behaviour of some members of the PBS crew, the official said there was a set procedure for addressing the issue.
“If PBS passengers have any genuine concern regarding the quality of service, they can complain officially. It would surely be looked into by the authorities concerned,” the official concluded.

The speakers said that the country needed unity and suggested that current crisis should be addressed through a consensus among all political parties. 
ACML president Khalid Masood Sindhu said they would approach every political party and despite all ‘conspiracies’, they would defeat anti-state activities. 
Qari Mohammed Yaqub of Ulema and Mashaikh Pakistan said that the country was facing conspiracies at both external and internal levels and anti-Pakistan forces were conspiring against nuclear potential of the country. 
He said politics had been equated with personal enmity and it was not politics, but a conspiracy against the country. 
Khawaja Izharul Hasan of MQM-P said under the prevailing sensitive situation, they supported the unity conference and it was a national duty to form a unity. 
He said if there would be no peace, there would be chaos in the country and they would foil any design against national security. 
Dr Abul Khair of JUP said that Pakistan faced many crises in the past, but present one was more dangerous as political parties were fighting against each other.
Mohammed Husain Mahenti of JI recalled that Pakistan came into existence through unity, but later on, chaos was spread in the country. He said every Pakistani was concerned over present chaos-like situation.

8,This week 50 years ago: German artists and high number of patients,KARACHI’S fondness for art and culture is known to all and sundry. Even today when the city is bursting at the...,"KARACHI’S fondness for art and culture is known to all and sundry. Even today when the city is bursting at the seams (though the census doesn’t suggest so) and there’s an ever-increasing crime rate, one gets to see activities related to art held both for the masses and for those who claim to have a cultivated taste. Here’s a lovely little example from half a century back. On May 8, 1973 this newspaper published a report saying the previous day an exhibition of graphics by two West German artists opened at the Goethe Institut. The exhibits were made by Uwe Nickel and Hartinut Koch who had employed modern techniques of engraving and printing. “The two artists reveal an immediacy of experience. They seem to have a life of their own, be it a clown or a heavyweight. While the simplified lines and figures add a touch of eeriness, the compositions dramatise the message and make the narrative plain and easy to grasp. Some of the pieces are in solid geometry. The prints are done sensitively and retain their original hues and lustre.”
While the importance of its cultural component could not be overlooked, Karachi has always been, demographically, the largest city of the country; therefore the magnitude of the civic issues that it faces on a daily basis is more than a nuisance for the authorities. On May 9, it came to light that the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) had disconnected water supply for several houses in Block 6 of PECHS. The corporation did that to prevent accumulation of sewage on the open plots in the area. The residents said they were recently served notices by the KMC to immediately connect their sewerage lines with the main ones laid by the corporation. The notices were served at 11am and by 6pm water connections for many houses were gone. On the other hand, the KMC in a communication claimed the sewerage system in the locality had completely broken down and needed repairs. 
The corporation was in the news for another reason that week which was to do with its revived tax imposition on publicity related to the movie business. On May 11, the Pakistan Film Exhibitors Association, Karachi Zone, in a statement protested against the revival of the KMC tax on cinema publicity. It stated that the provincial minister for local bodies had recently stayed recovery of the said tax assuring that it would be withdrawn for good, adding as a result of the imposition, the publicity process had been shifted to television which was free of tax.
But, arguably, the most pressing issue at the time unfolded in the health sector. On May 14, the media highlighted that unprecedented rush of patients in the two major hospitals of the city — the Jinnah Post-Graduate Medical Centre (JPMC) and Civil Hospital — had almost become unimaginable. The situation had deteriorated mainly due to the increasing incidence of diseases, shortage of doctors and lack of adequate medical facilities in the outlying areas of the Sindh capital. Hundreds of patients could be seen at the JPMC and Civil Hospital pacing up and down the floors and corridors begging for attention of doctors and the paramedical staff. Between 250 and 350 patients visited the outpatient departments every day, and the [then] existing number of doctors in the two facilities were insufficient to cope with the situation.

9,MQM-P terms digital census an issue of language,Vows to move all relevant local and foreign forums for fair enumeration in Sindh .,"HYDERABAD: Leaders of Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) said on Sunday that the current digital census clearly turned out to be an issue of language instead of rural-urban divide, and cautioned powers that be that parliament would be irrelevant for them if flaws were not rectified.
They said that their community which supported the MQM-P were not citizens of certain hostile countries that they should not be counted properly in the census in those cities with influx of illegal immigrants in addition to natural growth ratio.
Speaking at a programme titled Shahri Sindh Ka Muqdama at a banquet, MQM-P convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said people of urban areas were becoming irrelevant to all issues but rulers were not taking notice of it. “When Mohajirs’ elders come to Pakistan, Karachi was not part of Sindh and it had not been a part of Sindh historically as well. It was Pakistan’s capital. When ‘One Unit’ was came into effect, our elders were asked whether they want a separate province or remain part of Sindh. Our elders decided that Sindh needs us as we have established institutions here,” he said. 
Dr Siddiqui said he would not discuss historical mistakes as it would open a Pandora’s Box. Today, he said, there were ‘two Sindhs’ introduced by others.

Vows to move all relevant local and foreign forums for fair enumeration in Sindh 

“One Sindh contributes 97pc and the other utilises this 97pc budget,” he wondered.
He maintained rural urban divide was not given effect by MQM. He said if urban centres were excluded from Sindh, even 2pc budget would not be seen here. He asked why did the late [prime minister] Z.A. Bhutto introduce rural urban format in Sindh alone when he got majority in Punjab as well and if it was all about point of backwardness in Sindh. “
We didn’t introduce this rural-urban divide,” he remarked. He said that quota system was driven by issue of language and not by ‘rural-urban point’. “This digital census issue revolves around language and not rural urban factor,” he observed.
He said urban centres had no responsibility to contribute tax alone. “It’s jaziya, and not tax, being recovered from aliens. So, count us as aliens,” he said.
MQM-P only wanted that proper count should be done, he stressed.
Dr Siddiqui said an officer related to Sindh’s census conveyed a message that if rural-urban average was maintained, then things would be settled down. “MQM had approached government, state and every quarter only for a fair counting of our population,” he said. He added that an artificial majority was ruling over a majority and its chief minister was being artificially elected and he was using 100pc authority.
He said MQM-P did not want the 18th constitutional amendment rolled back, but its implementation and it also involved Article 140 which dealt with local government system. He remarked that the Constitution’s 50 years was being celebrated in the country although this document could not protect itself. “This Constitution gives so many rights but it was not sufficient. He said that the revenues generated in urban centres were not being spent for the poor but Dubai’s real estate which was growing. He asked people to explain what MQM-P should do if the population count was not transparently done. He said that his party had done enough to appease people. He hoped that rulers would realise delicacy and sensitivity of the situation.
‘MQM-P got census deadline extended’ 
Senior deputy convener Syed Mustafa Kamal said that it was MQM-P’s efforts that census date was extended. “Will this get you a Nobel prize or Nishan-i-Haider if you undercount cities? Or does city mayor have the authority to appoint army chief? City’s mayor only deals with sanitation issues,” he said, alluding to PPP’s vow to bring a jiyala mayor. 
Sharing details, he said, enumerators didn’t reach 1,464 buildings as per PBS’s own claim. “We are only warning you to desist from this; let the time come and people should not listen to us. We have approached every quarter for a fair census,” he said. 
Mr Kamal claimed that one million houses in Karachi and 137,000 in Hyderabad remained missing because each block in Karachi and Hyderabad showed 187 houses contrary to its usual numbers of 200-250 houses in other cities thus showing a deficit of 63 houses in each block of these two cities. In 2017 census, six persons were counted in each house of these cities but in 2023 the number dropped to five. This one person was not counted in 2.9m houses cumulatively. He said that mathematics of this census showed that around 5m people were not counted in these cities. “What are you doing with us?” he asked. All these figures, he said, were official statistics of PBS. He said that the ratio of households comprising just one person was nine per cent in Karachi and Hyderabad which was too interesting. 
“All these figures have to be fixed by PBS”, he said.
Mr Kamal said it was ridiculous that Jacobabad was showing 58pc and Larkana 38pc population growth while Karachi and Hyderabad just nine per cent growth.
Dr Farooq Sattar said that if justice was not done then MQM would be within its right to approach international forums like parliaments of Britain and Europe and think tanks in other countries to expose these anomalies in census.
He said that the 2017 census led to ‘40pc missing population in urban centres’ that needed to be recovered. “It shows as if our people are only dying,” he said.
Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce President Adeel Siddiqui, Hyderabad Small Chamber leader Altaf Memon and others also spoke.

The deceased personnel belonged to the Balochistan police and had entered the Jagir riverine area of Jacobabad in pursuit of the hostage and his kidnappers on April 26, a day after Furqan Soomro, the son of a mill owner, was taken away at gunpoint from the Kashmirabad area of Jaferabad {Balochistan). The police party was attacked by the gang, led by Mitho Shah. 
The kidnapping and heavy loss of life in the attack prompted the Balochistan and Sindh police to launch a joint operation on April 30 in the Jagir area which is still continuing. 
While claiming recovery of Furquan Soomro today (Sunday), the Jacobabad police told the media that after receiving intelligence report that the kidnappers were shifting the hostage to some other place from their hideout, a joint team of Jacobabad and Balochistan police rushed to a specified spot in the Jagir area, falling within the limits of the Mauladad police station, and engaged the gangsters holding Furquan Soomro hostage in an encounter. 
The action was tactfully taken to ensure no harm was caused to the hostage, the police said, adding that the kidnappers were forced to retreat after abandoning Soomro. 
They said the gangsters fled into the riverine area. 
Claims about payment of ransom 
Contradicting the entire version of the Jacobabad police, some relatives and neighbours of Furqan Soomro in the Osta Mohammad area of Baluchistan, alleged that the Mitho Shah gang was paid a hefty amount of ransom for his release. 
They claimed that the payment was made through a middleman. 
Reliable sources, however, told Dawn that the gang decided to release Furqan Soomro due to the immense pressure mounted by the Sindh and Balochistan police. 
The sources claimed that no encounter had taken place in the Jagir area or during the episode of Soomro’s release.

The meeting was chaired by Dr Bashir Nizamani and attended by Dr Zulfikar Yusfani, Malook Nizamani, Aslam Mari, Yar Mohammad Leghari, and others.
It noted that Sindh was getting 26pc less water flows despite water availability in dams and such situation would affect veggies and paddy crop. 
It observed that Punjab did not need water supplies at this point of time while dams could supply water to Sindh but latter was getting 26pc lesser flows.
SAB said that cotton crop would also be affected besides paddy. It urged federal government to take notice of the situation and ensure required flows to Sindh. It also viewed rising cost of inputs seriously and noted that last year urea fertiliser was selling at Rs1,650 per bag and now its price had increased to Rs3,000 a bag. But this input was actually available in market at a price of Rs3,300 to Rs3,400.
It expressed surprise that locally produced urea was being sold at exorbitant rates which was mindboggling. 
The SAB meeting said that disease in mango crop had caused losses to growers and orchard owners but the departments concerned did not take any remedial steps. It feared that this disease could spread on a larger scale. 
The SAB leaders urged the Sindh Agriculture Research department to take steps seriously in this regard.

12,"Unruly PPP candidate, around 150 others booked after hooliganism during by-poll","Several polling booths ransacked, election staff manhandled","HYDERABAD: By and large peaceful, the polling in the by-election for 10 constituencies of union committees was marred by lawlessness created by a candidate of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and his supporters at three polling stations on Sunday.
The unrest led to suspension of polling there with police registering an FIR against suspects and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) calling the contesting candidate and SSP, district returning officer (DRO) and returning officer (RO) to Islamabad on May 11 for a hearing of the matter.
Polling was scheduled in Hyderabad for five chairmen/vice chairmen of union committees and five wards of various committees. The process in the city began at the fixed time and continued peacefully in the first half. 
Trouble began in the second half in UC-119 of Shah Latifabad Town in Unit-10 of Latifabad when PPP candidate Saeeduddin and his supporters ransacked booths at three polling stations, took away lists, tore apart ballot boxes and manhandled female polling staff. 

Several polling booths ransacked, election staff manhandled

He had become furious over voters lists at the polling stations which, he claimed, were different from those available with him.
“When I started arguing with presiding officer at one polling station, rival candidate tried to reason with me which led to unpleasant incident,” he said alluding to independent candidate Imran Basheer. Saeed said he faced voters list problem at other polling stations as well and raised the objection there, arguing that how could he remain silent over it.
Local Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Nawab Khan claimed that a close contest was to be seen between Imran Basheer and PTI’s candidate Amir Afzal Shah, but PPP’s supporters ransacked polling stations which was condemnable. 
Imran Bashir held Saeeduddin responsible for causing disruption at polling stations unnecessarily.
The presiding officer of the female polling station Shaheed-i-Millat Primary School, Mohammad Junaid, told District Election Commissioner (DEC) that Saeeduddin and his supporters ransacked the polling booth and manhandled female staff. He said the candidate wanted him to stop the polling which he refused and his supporters attacked the polling station.
Rumpus was also witnessed at the polling station No. 6 set up in the Government Boys Primary School Shah Latif and female polling station No. 7 at the Govt Girls Primary School. 
DEC Yusuf Majidano told Dawn that polling staff including presiding officers of three polling stations held Saeeduddin responsible for the ransacking incidents. He said it was contesting candidate’s responsibility to receive an updated voters list and ECP was not supposed to deliver it to candidates.
“The May 2022 voters lists were used in Jan 15 polls because only polling was postponed last year. Since May 2022 to date, those who attained the age of 18 became eligible voters and got themselves enrolled, therefore, the lists were updated,” he explained. 
He said no problem occurred in other constituencies where PPP candidates were contesting and it happened in UC 119 alone. “It seemed to be all pre-planned act.”
He said an FIR had been lodged with B-section police Latifabad against 100-150 intruders. “The presiding officer concerned [Mohammad Junaid] has identified Saeeduddin and intruders as those who beat up the polling staff, besides throwing ballot boxes, ballots and ransacking polling booths,” he said. 
Majidano said polling had been suspended at all three polling stations and matter was referred to the ECP.
Provincial Election Commissioner Aijaz Anwar Chohan told Dawn that the ECP had taken notice of the incident and fixed the hearing for May 11. 
“Notices are issued to DRO, RO, contesting candidate Saeeduddin and SSP Hyderabad for hearing in the ECP office in Islamabad,” he said. 
He said polling was held at four out of seven polling stations set up in UC-119 and it was up to the ECP to decide whether re-polling would be held or by-poll would be announced in the entire UC.
All 37 polling stations were declared ‘sensitive’. By and large, polling remained peaceful in all the UCs.
