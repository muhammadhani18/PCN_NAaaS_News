In an experimental move, the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) has given the temporary charge of the FCE to Prof Mohammad Ihsanul Haq who is already principal of Islamabad Model College for Boys F-10/3.
Earlier, Saba Faisal, who was also principal at Islamabad Model College for Girls F-10/2, took the temporary charge of the FCE on March 3 on FDE’s direction. However, this decision was shortlived, as on May 5, the FDE abruptly replaced Ms Faisal with Prof Haq as the interim head of the college.
The removal of Dr Samia Rehman Dogar from FCE followed a series of transitional appointments which has had a detrimental impact on the college’s functioning.
Dr Dogar, who was professor at the FCE, was placed at Islamabad Model College for Girls G-10/4 on attachment basis.
A faculty member of the FCE on condition of anonymity said the FCE was now facing disruptions in its training programmes.
Ever since the administrative control of FCE was handed over to the FDE, its performance has suffered because the directorate lacks the capacity to handle higher education institutions, the faculty member said.
The FDE gives charge of the FCE to those who are already principals of some model colleges, he said, adding that the institution should have an independent head. 
He said the college had been suffering ever since the education ministry transferred Dr Samia Rehman Dogar and placed the administrative control of the institution under the FDE. 
Another faculty member of the college said leadership played a pivotal role in determining the success and sustainability of any organisation.
“Unfortunately, the FDE is currently grappling with a severe leadership crisis which threatens its ability to effectively manage its professional postgraduate institution,” he said.

1,City managers stressed as people’s water needs remain unmet,"ISLAMABAD: With the capital’s population rising to over two million people from around 800,000 in 2008, city...","ISLAMABAD: With the capital’s population rising to over two million people from around 800,000 in 2008, city managers are continuously under stress on how to cater to the basic needs of the residents.
Besides cleanliness, waste disposal, pollution control and maintenance of law and order, provision of sufficient water to households has become a gigantic task as a shortfall in routine supply by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) is forcing residents to purchase water from private operators.
As the population grew to 150pc during the last 15 years, available water resources are falling short of meeting the daily needs of residents, especially during the summer season.
The main sources of water for Islamabad are Simli and Khanpur dams which are dependent on rainfall and melted snow in catchment areas. The CDA had ignored this issue during past decades and since the construction of the Khanpur dam in the 1990s, no new source of water was explored.
Experts believe that if the present situation continues, Pakistan would fall in the list of water-scarce countries within the next few years.
Presently, we are a water-stressed country and shall slip down to the water shortage category in the next few years, if prudent policies are not adopted, said a renowned water expert.
We are cognisant of the situation and have recently recommended changes in existing bylaws proposing the construction of recharge wells for rainwater harvesting to replenish the city’s groundwater resource, said CDA Deputy Director General (Water) Sardar Khan Zimri.
He said the suggested amendments would make it mandatory for all homeowners to construct recharge wells alongside already constructed water tanks. The recharge wells would help to ensure water storage as well as a recharge water table, which would help reduce the depletion rate.
However, seeing the ground realities it is obvious that solely depending on rainwater harvesting or constructing recharge wells is not enough as there is a dire need to change the water usage habits of people, he said.
If those consuming water rampantly are charged at the same rate as those using less water, the wastage cannot be controlled. This discriminatory approach needs to be shunned to facilitate consumers across the board, he added.
According to an official and renowned water expert, when Islamabad was built, the groundwater level was just 50 feet low which has now gone down to 500 to 600 feet. 
This water shortage issue, he said gave birth to the rapid growth of tanker mafia who were exploiting needy people by charging whatever amount they want to provide water.
Making many wait for hours for water and providing others ample water for floor cleaning, car washing and gardening is in no way justified, he added.

2,Police detain man accused of murdering sister,"RAWALPINDI: A man, who allegedly murdered his sister over a property dispute, was detained by the Race Course police...","RAWALPINDI: A man, who allegedly murdered his sister over a property dispute, was detained by the Race Course police on the complaint of his mother, police said on Sunday.
Earlier, the woman’s death was declared “natural” but after her mother revealed the real story to the police, the deceased’s brother was arrested on murder charges, while his wife, mother-in-law and brother-in-law were also booked on the charges of instigating him to murder.
Anwar Jan, widow of Mohammad Shabbir, lodged a first information report (FIR) with police saying that she had bought a double-storey house in Dhoke Syedan eight years ago. She said her daughter Fahmeeda Bibi, who had been divorced, lived on the ground floor of the house as she had no children, whereas her son lived with his wife in the second portion of the house.
She said her son had been asking her to transfer ownership of the house under his name but she did not do so.
She said she came back from the United Kingdom on April 11, 2023 and was staying at her other son’s house when her elder son (the one who lived in the same house as the deceased) came to visit her.
Upon inquiry about her daughter Fahmeeda, she said, he told her that she was not at home. She got suspicious as Fahmeeda had not been responding to her calls as well.
Later, she said she was informed by her elder daughter Khadija that Fahmeeda had passed away in her house.
She said immediately after she was informed about the death of her daughter, Khadija and her other brother Yaqoob rushed to Fahmeeda’s house. They confirmed to their mother that Fahmeeda had died.
“It appeared that she did not die today, she seems to have been killed two to three days ago,” she said in the FIR, adding that her son (suspect) called the police himself and told them that his sister had been killed.
She said on May 5, 2023 when all family members were at home, she asked her son to reveal the truth and he confessed that he had strangled his sister on April 8 and then dragged her body inside the house.
While quoting her son, she said he could not dispose of his sister’s body and later started telling everyone that she had died and called police. 
She claimed that she was sure that her son on the instigation of his wife, mother-in-law and brother-in-law had murdered her daughter.

3,Work begins to formulate uniform building bylaws in all Rawalpindi tehsils,"Due to different bylaws, haphazard construction has been seen in urban areas of Rawalpindi, says official","RAWALPINDI: The district administration has started work on formulating uniform building bylaws in all tehsils and asked the assistant commissioners and other officials to send their suggestions in this regard.
Due to different bylaws in the tehsils, haphazard construction has been witnessed in urban areas. 
Some areas of the district have high-rise buildings while in others the construction of more than two storeys is not allowed. Commercial activities in residential areas are also apparently ignored in some parts of the district.
A senior official of the district administration told Dawn that the tehsil administration, district council, Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation and Rawalpindi Development Authority had prepared their own building bylaws that created problems for the residents and the buildings became eyesores.

Due to different bylaws, haphazard construction has been seen in urban areas of Rawalpindi, says official

He said there was a dire need to make same bylaws with minor changes keeping in view the geographic requirement of each area. 
He said commercial activities had increased in urban areas but the laws were outdated.
The district Rawalpindi had to make uniform bylaws but in city and cantonment areas these were different. 
The district administration should also see new building bylaws prepared by the Military Lands and Cantonments for cantonment areas.
In 2019, Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC) adopted new building bylaws under which parking area of more than 25 per cent of the total area of commercial plazas was fixed. 
However, buildings in narrow streets will pay parking a violation fee amounting to Rs200,000 to Rs400,000 in the city areas.
The height of commercial buildings were enhanced from three to eight storeys as these areas came under the jurisdiction of the RDA where there was permission for building more than three-storeys.
To avoid fire emergency, two fire exists would be allocated in the commercial areas; one for commoners and the second for special persons. 
Commercial plazas’ entry will be made on modern lines and the entry and exist points for special persons’ wheelchairs will be mandatory.
However, the district council and tehsils had different laws. They did not ask the builders to allocate parking area, fire safety and earthquake-proof structures. More than three storey residential houses were allowed in the district council and tehsils but in cantonment areas there was permission for only two-storey houses.
On the other hand, another district administration official said the administration wanted to generate revenue through commercialisation fee for which new building bylaws were being formulated.
Meanwhile, the district administration sent the sample of new building bylaws to the RMC, the district council and tehsil administrations through Whatsapp messages on May 5 and asked them to send their suggestions as soon as possible.
When contacted, District Council Chief Officer Fazle Akram said that the district council had started working on the new building bylaws and would finalise it soon.
RMC officials said they had adopted new building bylaws and other departments and civic agencies would make their new building bylaws.
They said the RMC had adopted building laws made by the previous Punjab government for 36 districts with some changes as per local requirements.
They said the same rules would be implemented in all the civic bodies of the district.

4,Scores of PTI supporters sent to Adiala jail,The party had held a rally in Islamabad on Saturday in violation of Section 144.,"ISLAMABAD: As many as four dozen PTI workers who were arrested on Saturday after the former ruling party held a rally in Islamabad in violation of Section 144 were sent to Adiala Jail on judicial remand on Sunday.
PTI Islamabad President Ali Nawaz Awan told Dawn that it was a clear violation of basic human rights as the rally was held after seeking permission from Islamabad High Court (IHC). “Moreover, it is strange that Section 144 is imposed in Islamabad for the last six months; ideally it should be imposed for 10 days only,” he claimed.
Mr Awan said that the police had registered cases in four police stations against 180 workers and leaders of the PTI, including Asad Umar, Ali Nawaz Awan and Raja Khurram Nawaz.
It is worth mentioning that the police detained PTI workers for creating a law and order situation and getting into a physical confrontation with the officials during a rally taken out by the party to express solidarity with the Supreme Court on Saturday.
The police had claimed that they tried to be lenient with the participants of the rally in order to avoid a confrontation with participants during the movement of the visiting Chinese delegation but later they were left with no option but to arrest them after they blocked traffic. It is worth mentioning the Chinese and Afghan delegations visited Islamabad on the same day.
On Sunday, a local court sent around four dozen workers of PTI to jail. The Margalla police produced 45 PTI workers in the court and the judge sent all of them to jail.
Six PTI workers were produced in the court by the Khanna police, but, as per Mr Awan, the court released them because of a lack of evidence. However, one worker, who was arrested by the Khanna police with a weapon, was sent to jail on judicial remand by the duty magistrate.
Mr Awan claimed four cases were registered against 180 supporters and over 60 PTI workers were arrested by the Islamabad police. “We had sought approval [for rally] from IHC Judge Babar Sattar…but the government did not accept the court orders,” he claimed.
Mr Awan claimed the police raided a number of houses in Rawat and other areas of the city on Sunday to arrest workers. “I cannot confirm the exact number of workers who have been arrested on Sunday, but arrests have been made,” he added.

6,Around 100 illegally-built structures demolished in Islamabad’s F-11,CDA official says 65pc of area cleared; locals given time until operation restarts in a few days.,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Sunday conducted a mega operation in Bheka Syedan F-11, demolishing around 100 houses/structures.
The area falls in sector F-11, right in front of the markaz but due to various reasons, the CDA could not get it cleared, as locals had been claiming that their compensation cases were pending.
Officials said that since 2011, the CDA has been making attempts to get the possession of the said land, but due to litigation it could not execute its plan.
They said that recently, the civic agency got various stays cleared, therefore, it conducted operations to clear the area. CDA officials said that meanwhile, over 100 original allottees also filed cases against the CDA for getting possession of plots. To this, the CDA first conducted an operation on Wednesday on a small scale and on Sunday, the operation was conducted on a large scale as around 100 houses and structures were demolished.

CDA official says 65pc of area cleared; locals given time until operation restarts in a few days

CDA, backed by police and local administration demolished the houses with heavy machinery. “We have cleared around 65pc of the area today. The locals requested us to give them one day for voluntarily demolishing their houses, therefore, we stopped the operation for one day,” said an official of CDA, who was part of the operation team. 
He said that the civic agency would re-start the operation in the next couple of days, in case people did not remove their structures.
“Meanwhile, we are going to submit a report before Islamabad High Court regarding operations and overall status of sector F-11,” he said.
The CDA had acquired sector F-11 through three awards announced in 1980, 82 and 85. According to CDA, it had cleared almost all compensation cases but over 100 locals are still claiming that their compensation is pending. An official of CDA said that some two decades back, then CDA deputy commissioner announced a review award making around 100 more people eligible for getting plots. 
Later, the CDA contested the said review and claimed that the review cases had no legal standing and it was announced on the basis of bogus documents.
“Now, the chronic issue of F-11 is going to end. After clearing all land, we will carry out necessary development work before handing over plots to allottees. 
“Whereas, in the said area (where operation was conducted) there is a planned class three shopping centre, which will be auctioned against billions of rupees,” the official said.
It is relevant to note here that CD’s enforcement wing is active since the last one week and so, as it first demolished hundreds of structures from sector C-13, Park Enclave III was cleared before moving towards F-11. 
CDA Chairman Noorul Amin Mengal had authorised the member estate Afnan Alam to conduct mega operation in Islamabad.

According to Buddhist traditions, Gautama Buddha was born on the night of the full moon in the month of May in 564 BC. When he attained the state of nirvana at the age of 35, it was the month of May and the night of the full moon.
Interestingly, when he died at the age of 80, it was still the month of May and the night of the full moon.
About 250,000 years ago, Vaisakh Day was celebrated in Taxila when Ashoka came to Taxila from his capital Magadh. Ashoka, whose empire extended from Burma to Central Asia, was seen as a sort of dervish. He wrote that he was “deeply pained by the killing, dying, and deportation that take place when an unconquered country is conquered.” This is why Ashoka renounced military conquest and other forms of violence, including cruelty to animals. He shared his new outlook on life through edicts carved into stones and pillars located around at pilgrimage sites and along busy trade routes. The edicts are considered among the first examples of writing in Indian history.
In addition to his edicts, Ashoka built stupas, monasteries, and other religious structures at noteworthy Buddhist sites.
To commemorate the day, a celebration was organised by Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC), in collaboration with the Gandhara Resource Centre Pakistan (GRCP), Centre for Culture and Development in collaboration with the Department of Archaeology and Tourism Punjab. Following ceremonial proceedings, the participants proceeded to the Gandhara Art Village Taxila, for an enlightening seminar with a fruitful exchange of ideas and insights.
During the seminar, High Commissioner of Sri Lanka retired vice admiral Mohan Wijewickrama emphasised on the profound importance of the Gandhara heritage of Pakistan for Buddhists around the world. Ambassador of Nepal Tapas Adhikari touched upon the cultural significance of Gandhara for Nepal, as the birthplace of Buddha.
Rana Aftab, managing director of PTDC, expressed his optimism towards the growth of religious tourism in Pakistan. 
He said that Pakistan was proud to be the custodian of historic Buddhist relics and monasteries and expressed hope for a strengthening of mutual cooperation and friendship between Pakistan and the Buddhist world.
Addressing participants, Zaildar Ahsan Shah, member advisory board, Pakistan Research Centre for a Community with Shared Future said the event showcased the cultural diversity, religious harmony and immense potential for religious tourism in the country. “Through collaboration and international support, Pakistan aims to preserve and promote its ancient Buddhist legacy, reinforcing its commitment towards fostering global understanding and peace,” he added.
A Pakistani Buddhist from rural Sindh, Munawar Lal addressed the challenges faced by the Buddhist community in Pakistan and emphasised on the need for international support for Buddhist countries.

10,"Jewellers reject 3pc sales tax, point of sale system",Say protest will be launched against decision taken by govt without consulting traders,"RAWALPINDI: The Sarafa and Jewellers Association on Sunday rejected the imposition of a three per cent sales tax (ST) and the installation of machines under the point of sale (PoS) system and asked the government to withdraw the decision or face street protests.
Addressing a joint press conference of traders and the association, Rana Abdul Qadoos, Saqib Rafique, Shahid Ghafoor Paracha and Sharjeel Mir said traders had rejected the decision of the government to impose the sales tax along with the the PoS and they will start a protest campaign if the government did not withdraw it.
They said the government had formulated polices without consultation with stakeholders. It is necessary to take the business community into confidence before formulating any economic policy, they said.
They traders are facing financial crisis due to the worst state of economy and jewellers have suffered a lot, they added. They said that in the wake of rising gold prices, the traders attached with jewellery and gems sector were hardly meeting their expenses on a regular basis.

Say protest will be launched against decision taken by govt without consulting traders

They emphasised that all issues should be resolved through negotiations. There is no input of gold and jewellers only charged the cost of redesigning and polishing gold and gems/precious stones.
They said the traders want to pay taxes but the FBR didn’t want to collect taxes. The jewellers asked the FBR to stop harassing them.
“If the unwarranted actions did not stop, the situation will get worse so the responsibility will rest upon the government.”
Mohammad Fayaz Qureshi, President Gems and Jewellers Association, said that the government made policies without taking the stakeholders into confidence.
“We talk about revenue but do not believe in implementation of sales tax and point of sales. Our sector plays a key role in the economy, but due to inflation people are selling their gold items and running their houses,” he said.
Tariq Jadoon said all demands of the jewellers’ association should be fulfilled immediately. The country is already facing an economic crisis and the government should not further test the patience of the business community.
RCCI President Saqib Rafiq said there was a need to promote the small and medium enterprises (SME) sector. Point of sales is not required at every shop. All issues will be raised at the government level, he said.
Rawalpindi Traders Association President Shahid Ghafoor Paracha said: “We were helping the government to prevent the country from further economic crisis. We demanded THE federal government to issue an order to the FBR to negotiate on our demands.”
He said if the issues WEre not resolved, there will be a nationwide protest. The FBR should stop sending notices until holding negotiations otherwise traders will surround the FBR offices and staged a sit-in.

13,200 arrested in operation against illegal wheat movement,"ISLAMABAD: During an operation against illegal/unapproved movement of wheat and its products, the district...","ISLAMABAD: During an operation against illegal/unapproved movement of wheat and its products, the district administrations of Islamabad and Rawalpindi on Sunday confiscated 638 vehicles and recovered over 14,500 metric tonnes of wheat besides arresting 200 persons.
The operation, which was initiated on the directions of Deputy Commissioner Islamabad Irfan Nawaz Memon, was conducted with the support of the Rawalpindi district administration.
According to ICT spokesperson Dr Mohammad Abdullah Tabassum, the deputy directors food Islamabad and Rawalpindi conducted a number of raids on illegal transportation of wheat and its products.
“In Islamabad, 34 vehicles were impound and shifted to police stations. Overall, 532 metric tonnes of wheat and its products were recovered from them and 23 persons were arrested from Islamabad and First Information Reports (FIRs) registered against them,” Dr Tabassum said.
“In Rawalpindi, 604 vehicles were impounded and 14,093 metric tonnes of wheat was recovered. These vehicles have been shifted to police stations and FIRs registered against 180 persons,” he said.
Every year, Pakistan produces wheat equal or more than its requirement but a large number of it is smuggled to Afghanistan due to which a shortage is faced at the end of the season leaving the country with no option but to import wheat and increase the support price for the next season so that farmers would be encouraged to grow more wheat.
This year, the government has already announced that wheat has been produced more than the requirement of the country for the current year but it is feared that Pakistan may face shortage again at the end of the year because of the smuggling of the commodity. The wheat is harvested from March to May.
Dr Tabassum said on Sunday the ICT administration also conducted an operation against price hike, encroachment and professional beggars.
“As many as 80 visits were made to check prices and fines were imposed and two shops were sealed. During the operation against encroachment, directions were given to remove the structures. Moreover, 700kg polythene bags were also confiscated.”
He said that raids were conducted against illegal sale of petrol and LPG filling stations.
Meanwhile, the capital police apprehended 16 outlaws from different areas of the city and recovered drugs and weapons with ammunition from their possession, a police public relations officer said.
He said following special directions of Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Akbar Nasir Khan, the police had intensified its crackdown on criminal elements.
“The Aabpara police arrested two persons allegedly involved in possessing illegal weapons and selling liquor and recovered 25 litres of liquor and one 30-bore pistol with ammunition from their possession. Likewise, the Bhara Kahu police arrested two suspects and recovered 20 bottles of liquor from their possession,” he said.
“Similarly, the Phulgran police arrested a man for possessing illegal weapons. The Tarnol police rounded up a man involved in possessing illegal weapon and recovered one 30-bore pistol with ammunition from his possession.

The SHOs, whose promotions have been withheld for one year, argued that the order was difficult to comply with amid hyperinflation as rather than achieving something tangible, it only increased the financial burden on sub-ordinates staffers – a situation not realised by the bigwigs.
They were referring to directives issued last month which ordered the SHOs and the staff deployed at police stations to stay on the premises of their respective police stations during off-duty hours as well, sleep on the premises and return to the station from duty points to mark attendance.

DIG Operations withholds promotion of 21 officials for one year

The SHOs were barred from leaving their respective limits without prior permission from the DIG Operations. The SHOs were asked to get a biometric machine from the Police Lines Headquarters as soon as possible and install it at respective police stations for 24-hour monitoring.
Promotions withheld
After the heads of police stations failed to implement the new directives, the DIG Operations issued an order, announcing punishments awarded to these officers for “inefficiency/negligence”. It said the SHOs failed to ensure the biometric attendance of their subordinates despite “clear directions”.
They deliberately avoided marking the attendance and remained out of the police station without any valid reason or purpose, the order said, adding that this depicted that the SHOs did not take the directions of seniors seriously. “The situation depicts their sheer negligence, lack of interest, and unprofessional attitude towards official duties, which amounts to gross misconduct and inefficiency on their part,” it added. The DIG said under the Punjab Police (E&D) Rules 1975, each SHO was awarded a punishment of “withholding of promotion for a year” with immediate effect.
The station house officers penalised by their operations chief included SHOs of the Secretariat, Aabpara, Kohsar, Women, Bhara Kahu, Banigala, Karachi Company, Tarnol, Shalimar, Margalla, Golra, Ramna, I-Area, Sabzi Mandi, Shams Colony, Nilore, Shahzad Town, Koral, Sihala, Lohi Bher, and Khanna police stations.
Order ignores lower staff
In response to the DIG’s order, officials told Dawn that there were 25 police stations across the capital, adding that there were no proper lodgings available at Lohi Bher, Nilore, Khanna, Shams Colony, and Banigala.
Also, Banigala, Lohi Bher and Khanna police stations have no proper structure, while the Golra police station was operational in an old structure; Shams Colony police station was situated in a rented building, and Nilore police station was also operational from a factory area.
According to the officials, the police said that the PSP officers were introducing new laws without focusing on the problems faced by the lower staff. “There are no proper facilities for the lower staff, including pick and drop, and the PSP officer [still] wanted the staff to come to their respective stations from their residence, mark their attendance through biometric, go to their duty points, perform over 12 hours of duty, return to their relevant station, mark their attendance again, and then go back to their homes,” they said, adding that this amounted to an increased financial burden on policemen.
All three points—residence, police stations, and duty point—are located far away from each other, the officials said, adding that the so-called competent and well-educated PSP officers were making laws that were “hard to obey”.
According to officials, succeeding police officers were creating more complications for the lower staff as compared to their predecessors. They said that the majority of the policemen were doing their job properly and remained present at their duty points, adding that some policemen skipped their duty but there were other ways to keep a check on them. Despite repeated attempts, the police’s PRO was not available for comments.
