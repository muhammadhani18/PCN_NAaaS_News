“This project is aimed at not only the promotion and revival of street theatre but also empowerment of the artistes who, otherwise, are victims of commercialism and middlemen,” Mr Zia says while talking to Dawn. 
He adds that in real life everybody does acting in different situations, proving that everybody is an artiste while the people in this region have always been good at expressing emotions. 
“The artistes who have no platform to perform can perform from our platform, which is open to all,” Usman Zia says, adding that the basic idea of Fankar Baraye Farokht is that the artistes would perform on roads and in the bazaars and get financial reward from the audience at the end of the performance. 
They would take their caps to the audience for whatever money an individual wanted to give to the performer from one rupee coin to any amount the members of the audience want to give. 
“These interactive theatre performances will be a movement not only for the rights of artistes but also to revive their respect, for an artiste needs only three things: honour, payment for labour and opportunity.”  
Mr Zia claims that the project would rule out the role of those who are controlling commercial theatre as well as the middlemen who exploit artistes. Youth will be the main component of this outdoor street theatre activity.  
“We call it a movement through theatre to empower artistes and provide them with opportunities to perform to get free from shackles of sheer commercialism,” he asserts.  
Usman Zia joined parallel theatre in 2005 and started working with Ajoka. He was sent to the famous National School of Drama (NSD) in India on scholarship by Ajoka. He did many courses from the NSD from 2007 to 2011 during his frequent visits. He performed in a number of plays at Amritsar with Indian Punjab’s leading theatre figure, Kewal Dahliwal, while renowned actor Naseeruddin Shah was among his teachers at the NSD.  
Zia teaches theatre at different colleges and institutes, including the Kinnaird College and the Civil Services Academy. He has also performed in films such as Zinda Bhag, Maula Jutt and Bol. He was declared the best actor twice for private drama serial Jo Bichar Gaye.

1,"With skyrocketing prices of cars, theft of their parts also on the rise in Lahore","Thieves target side-view mirrors, tyres and batteries; no reliable data of crime available with police.","LAHORE: Stealing side-view mirrors, batteries, tyres and other accessories of vehicles, particularly of the luxury cars, seems to be a ‘petty crime’ for police but the citizens are paying a heavy price for it as such incidents have increased manifold in recent times after several new groups of the criminals sprung up in the provincial capital.
The criminals target the cars and other vehicles parked in the streets and by the roadsides in the commercial markets and even in the parking lots of the residential areas. Since the majority of the crime incidents go unreported, hence the crime remains unchecked in Lahore, luring more criminals to get involved in such crime and sell the stolen parts of the cars in the black market.
An interesting aspect of this crime is that the Lahore police have no reliable data of the stolen side-view mirrors, batteries and other such accessories as most of the car owners don’t report the crime due to multiple reasons, prime of them being the attitude of police. This category of crime is increasing with every passing day in every hook and corner of the city.
Dawn contacted many station house officers (SHOs) and the officials of the investigation wing police who, requesting anonymity, say that the crime mentioned above increased in the city after the car owners stopped reporting it due to various reasons. They claim that the majority of the criminals committing crime have escaped punishment due to the non-registration of the cases.

Thieves target side-view mirrors, tyres and batteries; no reliable data of crime available with police

On the other hand, the sources say that one of the major reasons is that the victims/car owners avoid calling 15 or visiting police stations to report the crime due to the ‘traditional behaviour’ of police towards the citizens. Many others don’t bother to report these robberies as they consider them ‘less damage to their vehicles’ while police have declared it a petty crime.
Recently, the prices of the vehicles, particularly of the cars, increased manifold, hence the ‘petty crime’ related to cars also increased when the prices of the accessories too witnessed a spike.
A source says that the majority of the incidents have gone unreported and the situation has become so precarious that this ‘petty crime’ has spread from streets and markets to the much-protected private housing schemes. Some days back, thieves stole all the four tyres of the car of the PTI’s former MNA Shunila Ruth. She had parked her car outside her residence in the Pak Arab Housing Society in the jurisdictions of the Kot Lakhpat police. She called the police, lodged a complaint but the investigation police neither contacted her nor bothered to visit the crime scene. Finally, the source says, Ms Ruth had to purchase new tyres for her car. However, the PTI leader released a video clip, exposing the police negligence regarding her case.
According to some reports, many other such incidents have occurred in the same society in which thieves stole side-view mirrors, batteries and tyres of 17 cars of the residents during the last one month.
Similarly, the criminals removed side-view mirrors of 12 cars and batteries of 34 other vehicles parked alongside a patch of Ferozepur Road from Qainchi to Chungi Amar Sidhu during the last one month or so. As the majority of the incidents have gone unreported, the criminals are having field day in the area.
This crime is also flourishing in the posh areas of Johar Town, Model Town, Defence Housing Authority, Gulberg, Iqbal Town, Nawab Town, Kahna and Shahdara.
According to the unofficial figures, thieves targeted at least 70 cars in the areas mentioned above during the last two months or so, though the sources say the number of the cars targeted in these areas maybe more than 150. The citizens are very upset at the crime increasing every day.
A few days back, thieves stole two back tyres of a new luxury sedan car parked outside the house of a citizen in the OPF Society. A camera detected the crime and the footage and the photos later went viral on social media, triggering strong criticism against the police for their failure to control the criminals.
Another incident took place in the same (OPF) housing scheme two days back when thieves removed all four tyres of a hatchback when the owner parked it near a greenbelt and went to a shop. The video clip of the incident also went viral on social media when the police didn’t respond to the 15 calls.
Similarly, the source says, unidentified thieves stole side mirrors of a luxury SUV parked near the Liberty Roundabout. The owner had arrived from Islamabad to meet his relatives.
According to the reports, the thieves/criminals use screwdrivers to remove the side-view mirrors of vehicles. Some others unplug the side mirrors with a forceful jerk, causing other damages to the cars.
Requesting anonymity, a spare parts dealer running a business near the Ali Hajveri Shrine, tells this reporter that the many suspects would visit the market to sell dozens of side-view mirrors and other stolen accessories of the cars. For the criminals, he says, it’s easy to remove or steal side-view mirrors and sell them in the market at throwaway prices, adding that the Japanese or other imported cars are the prime target of the thieves as their parts are costly.
“One can get multiple locks from the markets to protect one’s car but there is no such remedy available to secure the side-view mirrors.”
The dealer says a group of thieves is specialised in stealing the batteries and they are so adept at it that they remove the batteries within a few minutes.

As per police, Ammar Yasir, a constable, was admitted to the Nishtar Hospital on May 3 with dengue fever. On Saturday afternoon, the patient went for a walk outside the ward and fell into an open manhole and died.
A Rescue 1122 team called on the scene recovered the body from the manhole and handed it over to his family.
Victim’s father Ghulam Ahmad Malik later approached the Cantonment police station and lodged a complaint against the hospital administration for not taking care of his son and also not covering the manhole on the hospital premises.
He demanded registration of a case against the hospital administration, seeking justice for his son. “My son was deployed in Rojhan for Katcha area operation, where his condition deteriorated after suffering from dengue fever and was admitted to the hospital,” he said.
The Cantonment police registered the case against the hospital administration under section 322 (Punishment for qatl-i-besabab) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and started investigation.

3,Farmers allege forceful seizure of wheat by govt,"LAHORE: Farmers allege that the food department and district administration are forcefully seizing wheat from them,...","LAHORE: Farmers allege that the food department and district administration are forcefully seizing wheat from them, preventing them from keeping the commodity for domestic use or as seed for the next season.
The food department, however, says it recovered thousands of bags of wheat that were hidden in rice factories in the Gujranwala district during its campaign against the hoarding of grain.
Khalid Khokhar, Pakistan Kissan Ittehad president, said in a press release that in major grain markets, the price of wheat has reached the level of Rs5,000 per 40kg in the first week of May. He finds this situation concerning, especially considering that the district administration is conducting raids at farmers’ houses to obtain harvested wheat from them. Farmers are not even allowed to keep wheat for domestic use, farm labour or seed purposes.
Mr Khokhar also claims that the food department and district administration are so desperate to achieve the procurement targets that they have seized hundreds of bags of basic seed of a new variety, whose multiplication and processing rights have been purchased by a leading seed company. Despite having all the required documents and registration with the Federal Seed Certification and Registration Department, seed bags were not released, and instead, the seeds were mixed into ordinary food grains. He regrets the lack of commitment, seriousness, and long-term vision for national food security.
Mr Khokhar fears that the government’s shortsightedness and poor governance will negatively impact wheat production next year, as the country already has a low national average yield, and if certified seed is not available, the yield will further decline.
Meanwhile, Punjab Food Secretary Muhammad Zaman Wattoo, along with the Gujranwala deputy commissioner, raided 19 rice mills in Noshehra Virkan and recovered 63,128 bags of wheat that were illegally stored there. The seized grain was transported to the wheat procurement centres. The mills included Naimat, Shaheen, Nisar, Abdur Rehman, Hayat, Noor Bath, Four Star, Rajput, Alsadiq, Rehmat, Madni, Adil, Alfazal, Akmakka, Hanjra, Green For rice mills, and others.

4,Work on ‘CBD square boulevard’ to begin by month-end,"LAHORE: The construction work on a newly-planned 300-foot wide major road, with a flyover to cross railway tracks,...","LAHORE: The construction work on a newly-planned 300-foot wide major road, with a flyover to cross railway tracks, connecting Walton Road and Ferozepur Road, from Gulberg central business district, is all set to begin by end of this month, as preparatory arrangements are currently being completed by the Punjab Central Business District Development Authority (PCBDDA) — formerly the Lahore Central Business District Development Authority — and the project is expected to complete within four months, Dawn has learnt.
“This is a unique project that is considered to be the core component of the Pakistan’s first business district project — Central Business District (CBD). Since Rs8.5 billion PC-1 of the 3.5km-long road-flyover project titled “CBD square boulevard” has been approved, we are set to start construction work by end of this month,” PCBDDA chief executive officer (CEO) explained while talking to Dawn. 
Discussing salient features of the project, CEO Mr Amin said the proposed site for the road has already been connected with the Kalma Chowk’s CBD underpass that has been completed a couple of days ago, but couldn’t be opened for the traffic since there was no road ahead for the motorists seeking entrance to the CBD project area, to reach Walton Road.  
After completion of the boulevard, the motorists will be able to easily enter the CBD, using Kalma Chowk underpass, blue lane and the CBD underpass. This underpass concludes at the point where once some plant nurseries existed.  
The PCBDDA CEO said the authority would be spending funds on this project from its own financial resources, as no funding from the provincial government or the parent department would be sought. He said the project would give access through slip roads to the Falcon Housing Society, Askari-V, Gulab Devi Hospital and Ferozepur Road and cross the railway tracks through a flyover and finally connect to Ferozepur Road. 
“After the project’s completion, the traffic burden on Ali Zeb Road and the Ferozepur Road would reduce, as the motorists seeking access to Walton Road and reach various phases of DHA would prefer using this new road,” Mr Amin said. 
To a question, Mr Amin said the road would have high-rises on its both sides — the main feature of the business district. The main CBD, according to him, has been divided into to two districts— Quaid district and Bab district. Quaid district will consist of the land from Kalma Chowk to the originating point of the proposed flyover, while the Bab district will comprise the land starting from the endpoint of the flyover and end at Walton Road (Bab-e-Pakistan). 
“Both districts will have state of the art infrastructure, roads, special pedestrian areas/walkways, residential and commercial areas, malls, shopping centres, parking areas, apartment buildings, high-rises etc. After completion of the entire CBD project, one part of which (new Kalma Chowk underpases, remodeling of the roads) has been completed recently, the Lahore will look like a modern, international city,” he maintained.  
Meanwhile, the PCBDDA management opened the Centre Point underpass for the traffic informally on Sunday, giving a signal free access to motorists travelling from Barkat Market (Garden Town) to Cavalry Ground and onward via Kalma Chowk, Ali Zeb Road, Lal Shehbaz Qalandar underpass (Firdaus Market) and Cantt flyover.  
The underpass was opened for the traffic in the presence of Lahore Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa, who visited the Kalma Chowk remodeling project. 
“This is soft launch of the underpass by the commissioner. The formal inauguration will be done by caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi in a day or two,” the PCBDDA chief said. The CBD underpass would also be opened for traffic soon after completion of the boulevard project on which civil work would soon be launched, he added. 
It merits mentioning that the Kalma Chowk Remodeling Project is one of the core components of the Lahore CBD project and aims to allow an easy access to the CBD at Walton, avoiding the traffic in the vicinity. The project’s first underpass (from Barkat Market to CBD area at Gulberg and Walton) is 285 meters long, having two barrels (each having 35 feet width with around 17 feet vertical clearance). Its second two-lane underpass turning towards Ali Zeb Road from Centre Point, measuring 632 metres, has two barrels (each having 38 feet width and around 17 feet vertical clearance), allowing the light as well heavy transport to pass though it.

5,"punjab notes: Waris Shah’s text, a novel and professional life story",Editing of classical texts has been a serious problem for the last two centuries for editors and scholars in Punjab....,"Editing of classical texts has been a serious problem for the last two centuries for editors and scholars in Punjab. Strangely, the most popular text “Heer Waris Shah” has proved the most contentious. The reason are not unfathomable. Firstly, there were differences in texts of hand-written manuscripts available at a time when printed press was introduced in Punjab in the 19th century. Increasing demand for Heer Waris pushed the publishers into the rat race; they began hiring half-baked editors and rooky scholars to edit the text in the name of providing the readers with ‘Asli te Vadi Heer (the original and complete Heer)’. As a result the text was loaded with interpolations
baring the uneven quality of the verses.
The poets and editors namely Mian Hidaytallah and Piran Ditta Triggarwala generously inserted their own verses in the text making the mess messier. The process still continues.
Dr. Muhammad Shahid Afzal’s book “Heer Waris Shah / Matan aur Murattebeen (the text and the editors)” published by Ashnak International, Shahkot, Nankana Sahib, precisely deals with the problem the editing of Heer has posed.
Dr. Shahid, an expat, is a physicist by training, and a scientist and technologist by profession. He has already done some remarkable work on the text of Heer Waris Shah and published his version of the text.
In his latest publication the text of Heer Waris edited in the 20th century by some notable editors such as Sheikh Abdul Aziz (Bar-at-Law), Sharif Sabir and Dr. Mohan Singh Diwana come under close scrutiny. His special focus is on the first two. He critically examines and analyses the work done by Abdul Aziz and Sharif Sabir. It’s generally agreed that Abdul Aziz achieved a remarkable feat; he not only collected a score of manuscripts, compared them and painstakingly prepared a version of Heer that surpasses any other till date. His method was reliable as it followed the modern research principles. He points out clearly how and why he selected the stuff which made his version.
Dr. Shahid acknowledges the Aziz’s great contribution but a bit grudgingly. When he examines the text prepared by Sharif Sabir under the supervision of Waris Shah Memorial Committee set up by the Punjab government, his criticism is scathing though not without justification. Sharif Sabir without logic or justification has changed or inserted words and phrases which are obviously extraneous to the original text as shown by Dr. Shahid as well as by other scholars. He quotes concrete examples from the edited texts including that of Sharif Sabir where editors fail either to decipher the words or understand them for being in a language/ dialect not understood by them. The most reliable manuscript, in his opinion, is that of Kirpa Ram presented to Divan Hardev Singh, which is now with the Punjab Public Library in Lahore.
One can agree with Dr. Shahid that language used by Waris Shah is predominantly Lehndi (western dialect) but you don’t have to have Lehndi as your mother tongue to fully understand it. Dr. Shahid is a polyglot and that has helped him to explain some of misunderstood references and allusions rooted in foreign cultures we find in Heer. His book carries a mark of serious scholarship not frequently found either side of the Punjab. It will be a source of delight for editors, scholars and connoisseurs interested in knowing the secrets the text of our greatest bard hides under its veneer. 
Amber Hossaeni makes her debut as a novelist with her “Pero” published by Punjab Markaz, Lahore. The title obviously evokes the image of famous Pero Preman, the poet and mystic of 19th century.
Pero in our cultural history represents simultaneously what a woman is reduced to in patriarchy and how she can go beyond the restrictive parameters and become a metaphor of defiance, freedom and spiritual bliss. Her rising from the ashes of prostitution to have become a mystic is a story that has mythical dimension. The novel is divided into 12 small chapters. The main protagonist of the narrative is a young woman named Pero whose emotional relationship with a man in no way can stop her getting involved in things bigger than personal such as struggle for women rights and social causes. “Making the central character a spokesperson of women rights is not something unnatural but looks a bit exaggerated at some places as if there is a little more salt in the dish than needed,” says Jameel Paul in the blurb.
About the structure and the characters of the novel, Dr. Karamat Mughal writes in his introduction: “The novelist while depicting her characters takes care not to unnecessarily paint convoluted pictures of life. She avoids the temptation to expand her narrative with superfluous details as new writers are wont to do. Amber Hossaeni uses dialogues generously to develop her narrative.” The novel offers the readers a contemporary female perspective and is a pleasant read. 
Dr. Mohsin Mighiana is a senior surgeon. He is from the land of legendry Heer and Sahiban, and Dr. Abdul Salam, our Nobel laureate. His passion is literature. He is a poet, short story writer and humourist and has a number of books to his credit in Punjabi, Urdu and English. “Making of a Chief Surgeon” is his latest book published by Sangry Publications, Faisalabad. It’s a fascinating story of his long journey as a medical student and practitioner. What could be unusual about it? Unusual is the relentless struggle of a young man to be a highly trained professional from an underdeveloped area where superstition is taken as knowledge and feudal sluggishness is valued as refinement. The story begins when he himself while studying in the college suffers from excruciating pain and is taken to a hospital on a horse-drawn cart, and experiences the pain and the misery of a helpless patient which represents the plight of millions and millions of people in our homeland. The story doesn’t merely epitomise his firm resolve to join and shine in the medical profession but also reflects the economic problems and social and cultural habits of his fellow travelers. His is story of human interest that delineates some important facets of our life in a semi-urban area sandwiched between a frozen past and a fast changing present. It’s an unusual book with unusual insights regarding our individual and social life. — soofi01@hotmail.com

7,Used car gala attracts throngs of people,LAHORE: People throng the used car gala organised by a well-known motor company for sale and purchase of certified...,"LAHORE: People throng the used car gala organised by a well-known motor company for sale and purchase of certified used vehicles not older than five years at the Expo Centre, Johar Town on Sunday.  
The event featured display of a number of hatchbacks of up to 1,300CC, brought by a number of car dealers to attract the buyers. 
“I witnessed such a mega event for the first time in Lahore. And I think it is a good forum to buy certified cars,” said a visitor while talking to Dawn. 
“But the rates are also on the higher side—perhaps due to inflation, dollar exchange rate etc,” he added. 
The event provided a car-exchange opportunity also to the buyers besides introducing various promotional schemes. 
“Though we are already giving a very reasonable asking price, we can even reduce it slightly further, depending on the model and condition of the vehicle. We can even reduce the rates more if someone buys two or three cars,” said a dealer while talking to this reporter. 
However, he added, the models of the cars older than five years were not allowed to be displayed as the event organisers don’t certify them due to warranty period and other issues. 
“Only the car in the warranty period can be declared as a verified unit,” he made it clear. 
Talking to Dawn, a representative of the motor company, said the event remained successful as a large number of people visited and purchased several vehicles. 
“Under the slogan of ‘Key to Key’, this gala has appeared to be successful keeping in view the skyrocketing prices of new vehicles due to dollar rates, low production and other related issues.” 
He said though sale of certified used cars is tough in Lahore in general but his company managed to arrange this event and provided certified vehicles to the people. 
To a question, he said the event was also aimed at showcasing only hatchbacks that are usually considered as fuel efficient with easy-movement in crowded/congested areas. 
LESCO: In a major operation, a team of the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) in Chunian tehsil of Kasur caught 11 people stealing electricity from the transmission lines. The team disconnected all illegal power connections and gave applications to the police station for registration of the cases.

As per officials, the raid was conducted on the warehouse after receipt of laboratory report of the samples which declared the fertiliser fake and harmful for crops.
They said the department had sent the fertiliser samples to the laboratory for chemical examination some months ago.
Following the raid, the officials sent the case to Bahawalpur Saddar police for legal action against the company’s owner under the Punjab Fertilizer Control Act.
TWO DIE: A man and a woman died and two others suffered injuries in separate road accidents in the district on Sunday.
According to Rescue 1122 officials, Muneer Bibi (56), died and two others were seriously injured when the motorcycle they were riding was hit by a Channigoth-bound bus at Tahirwali, about 75kms from here.
In another accident, a man identified as Mukhtiar Ahmed (23) died from head injuries allegedly after he jumped from a moving bus.
As per Rescue 1122 officials, the man, whose identity is not known yet, was traveling in a bus along with a wedding party.
He allegedly jumped out of the moving bus after getting angry over some issue and suffered fatal head injuries resulting in his immediate death.  
His body was handed over to his family members by police after initial inquiry into the matter. 
SEALED: The administration sealed a petrol pump in Yazman for alleged short measuring.  
As per officials, petrol-pump owned by a former MPA Chaudhry Ehsanul Haq, who has joined the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) sealed after detection of short measuring.
Haq used to be in the local PML-Q group led by federal minister Tariq Cheema.  
However, when former chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi merged his faction of the PML-Q with the PTI, Haq chose to side with him. He has recently been nominated as the PTI candidate for the Punjab Assembly seat from Yazman tehsil.
His supporters termed the sealing of the petrol-pump an act of victimisation to force Mr Haq to leave the PTI. They alleged that recently Dr Fasih, a son of former PML-Q MPA Dr Muhammad Afzal, (now in the PTI), was removed from the health department job on the pretext of remaining absent from his place of posting.  
Dr Afzal is also the PTI candidate for the other Punjab Assembly seat in Yazman tehsil.  
Their supporters alleged that both the PTI candidates were being victimised by the caretaker provincial government at the behest of federal minister Tariq bashir Cheema, also MNA from tehsil Yazman, and a member of ruling coalition Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM).

10,"Unchecked growth of private hostels causing social, safety issues","BAHAWALPUR: The unchecked mushroom growth of unauthorised private hostels, both for boys and girl students in the...","BAHAWALPUR: The unchecked mushroom growth of unauthorised private hostels, both for boys and girl students in the city, is causing various issues in the localities where these establishments are being run, mostly without following municipal by-laws and in the absence of any official record.  
Such hostels have cropped up in various localities of the city and are allegedly being condoned by the local officials of departments concerned, particularly the municipal corporation (MC) and the Excise and Taxation (E&T) department.
Dawn has learnt that presently there are a total of 34 such unauthorised hostels in the limits Kotwali, Cantonment, Civil Lines and Baghdad-ul-Jadid police stations, falling in the MC jurisdiction. The Civil Lines police station has the maximum (17) private hostels in its jurisdiction, but without any proper registration and record.  
The owners of these hostel buildings are minting money, most of them overcharging the students living there in groups. Though most of these buildings are in dilapidated condition and lack even basic amenities, no official bothers to check them.  
The residents living in the vicinity of the boys hostels also feel inconvenience because of presence of male students. They allege that these hostels are visited by people round the clock without any check-in and check-out timings, causing disturbance to the residents, especially during night. Similarly, the residents have reservations about the girls’ hostels.
Dawn has learnt that both the MC and E&T officials condone violations of the by-laws by the hostel owners and seldom serve them notices for commercial use of residential buildings.  
However, the issue was highlighted following the death of two female university students in a roof-collapse incident at a girls’ hostel.  
When contacted, some MC officials claimed that they had already served notices to some of the hostels for buildings’ safety, but these claims could not be confirmed independently.  
Sources says that in many cases, E&T officials connive with the hostel owners and charge them residential rates of property tax, despite commercial use of the buildings.  
Similarly, the local officials of the Multan Electric Power Company (Mepco) and the Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited (SNGPL) mostly ignore commercial use of the public utility services by these hostels, allegedly after receiving illegal gratification.  
Officials of both departments, however, claim that they don’t have any record of commercial use of these buildings.  
In the wake of the deaths caused by roof collapse at a girls hostel, it is being expected that the district administration will swing into action and order its allied departments to launch a crackdown on the private hostels for enforcement of by-laws on these premises and keeping their record to avoid social and safety issues.

Nawaz of Ghakharmandi, a property dealer with two marriages, was kidnapped and strangled by his second wife, Amina Bibi, and her family. The body was burnt and thrown into the canal. 
The deceased’s son, Omar Nawaz, from his first wife, filed a complaint, and the police registered a case. The accused were traced using scientific and traditional methods of investigation, and all of them were arrested under the guidance of CPO Gujranwala.
During a briefing, Wazirabad Deputy Superintendent of Police Saeed Ahmed revealed that Nawaz was last seen going to meet his second wife in Kotli Mughalani of Ferozwala on the second day of Eid and later went missing. 
Amina and her family invited him to her maternal house, where they first anesthetized him with a drug and then brutally killed him. 
The accused desecrated the dead body with a hammer and bricks to mutilate the victim’s face, wrapped it in a blanket, and burnt it. 
The police recovered the body from the Muridke Canal in the Sheikhupura area.
ACCIDENT: Nine people, including three women, were seriously injured when a car collided with their auto-rickshaw near the bridge on GT Road near Wazirabad on Sunday. 
The rickshaw was going from Wazirabad to Gujarat when the accident occurred, and the rickshaw rammed into the safety wall. The injured were shifted to the Wazirabad Civil Hospital, and the car driver fled the scene.
PFA: Director General of the Punjab Food Authority (PFA) Raja Jahangir Anwar led a crackdown on fake juice makers in Mandi Bahauddin. 
During the operation, the police recovered 1,170 litres of fake juice, which was later sent for lab analysis. The juice was found to be harmful to health due to the use of poor-quality chemicals and artificial flavours to increase its taste and thickness. 
The attractive packaging was misleading, and the juice was destroyed. The PFA urged the public to report counterfeiters and counterfeit mafia in their surroundings on the Punjab Food Authority’s Facebook page and Helpline 1223. 
He emphasized that the quality of health and the quality of food products would not be compromised, and those who violated the rules of hygiene would be punished.

12,Fuel spill on road suspends traffic for seven hours,TOBA TEK SINGH: Traffic was blocked for more than seven hours on Shorkot Cantonment-Shortish City Road on Sunday due...,"TOBA TEK SINGH: Traffic was blocked for more than seven hours on Shorkot Cantonment-Shortish City Road on Sunday due to a leak of 50,000 litres of furnace oil from an oil tanker that overturned after colliding with another tanker while overtaking. 
Rescue 1122 and Highway Patrol Police closed the road for traffic and redirected it to alternate link roads while their staff put earth on the leaked oil to avoid the danger of fire. 
The tanker was removed with a crane. Both tankers were en route to Rawalpindi from Karachi. 
The driver of the overturned tanker was given first aid by rescuers.
Meanwhile, on Saturday night, a car caught fire and completely burnt due to a short circuit on Gojra-Faisalabad Road near Chak 278 JB Dharamkot. Sibghatullah Khan of Bannu and his family members, who were travelling from Painsara to Gojra, jumped out of the car and remained unhurt, according to Rescue 1122.
FESCO: The Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco) will hire 600 private guards in eight districts of its region to ensure the security of its offices and installations. 
Fesco board of directors chairman Malik Tehsin Awan told reporters on Sunday that the recruitment will initially be for one year, which can be extended for a further two years based on satisfactory performance.
WORKSHOP: A non-government organisation with the Population Welfare Department, Health Department, Social Welfare Department, and National Nutrition Programme, organised a workshop on reproductive health problems caused by early marriage.
Speakers said that parents and teachers should play a key role in preventing the practice of early marriage for girls, as it is a threat to the lives of both the mother and the child. 
A 16-year-old girl is not eligible to vote, drive, maintain a bank account, or apply for a computerized national identity card, yet she is considered eligible to take up the responsibilities of married life under the law in Punjab province. However, in Sindh, the minimum age limit for both males and females is 18. 
It is clear in the Act to Prevent Early Marriage of 2015 that the age of puberty for girls is 18 years, so everyone should support the demand to amend the law in Punjab to fix the minimum age for marriage of both girls and boys at 18 years, replacing the existing law of the minimum age of 16.
District Population Welfare Officer Dr Mian Muhammad Naeem, social activist Rafia Ashfaq, Deputy Director of Social Welfare Rai Abdul Shakoor Marth, former district council minority member Rashid Jalal, and lawyers Abida Parveen and Rubina Behzad spoke.

GUJRAT: The Punjab Archaeology Department has launched the restoration of the remnants’ of a 16th century building of Dak Chowki in Wazirabad. 
The mail station is located on the Grand Trunk GT road as it makes its way north across the river Chenab. It was established in the 1560s during the rule of Sher Shah Suri, the founder of the short-lived Suri dynasty which collapsed only 11 years after his death. 
The purpose of the building was to serve as the post office. The square shaped building is built over a raised platform. 
Suri Dak Chowki Wazirabad had been in deteriorated condition for decades where there is no roof/dome on the structure. One corner burj is missing while lime plaster, brick masonry and flooring have decayed at places. 
The official sources said the then Gujranwala commissioner who also later served as secretary tourism, Ehsan Bhutta, took the initiative to restore the historical building to its original state according to archaeological standards. 
It is crucial to respect such historical sites and take steps to ensure their longevity, says an official of the archaeology department in the region. Restoring them to their original glory not only provides an opportunity to learn about the past but also serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving our heritage for future generations, he adds. 
According to a signpost on site, the post office was established not just for the mail but also to gather intelligence on activities within the district. Such post offices were generally incorporated within caravanserais (rest areas for travellers), given their association with travel, but this particular station is a stand-alone structure as there is no evidence of a caravanserai on site. 
In its heyday, the building likely would have contained stables and at least several well-rested horses to serve as points on a relay conveying mail from one station to another up and down the GT Road. In his book Gujranwala: the Glory that Was, Salman Rashid notes that in the past, a grove of trees about 200 meters from the building once housed the remains of the horse stables, which are now completely effaced. 
At the first glance, the profile of the building is reminiscent of typical tombs of the period as building typologies of the period could easily be employed for a variety of purposes. In the plan, it is laid out as a four-cornered structure with arched openings facing the four cardinal directions. A dome once towered overhead but it collapsed at some indeterminate point in the past. The remains of three ornamental brick turrets remain on the eastern and northern sides of the structure, along with the heavily degraded traces of some of the original stucco coating. 
Imran Zahid, an engineer of the archaeology department, said the major components of the restoration project had been the underpinning work with special size brick and kankar lime plaster. There are bricks on edge flooring as per the original design with tiles of special size. Provision for gratings in openings, brick tile on edge flooring with standard size brick, construction of boundary wall with iron fencing, electrification, illumination of the tomb and provision for public facilities like benches, dustbins etc are also a part of the structure.
