1,Health dept asks centre to release funds for KP’s first children hospital,The federal govt had started work on the hospital 10 years ago.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department has asked the federal government to provide funds to it for purchasing equipment to make operational the province’s first Children Hospital by end of the current year, according to officials.
The federal government had started work on Khyber Institute of Child Health (KICH) and Children Hospital 10 years ago. KICH, the academic portion, has already been completed while Children Hospital, the clinical part, is yet to be made operational owing to allocation of insufficient funds by federal government for the purpose.
Officials said that except Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, other three provinces had got full-fledged children hospitals and institutes where training of doctors, nurses, paramedics and other staff was bringing improvement in child health scenario there.
They said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa made efforts to get the required funds and complete the hospital but to no avail. As a result, 17 million children would suffer as there was no specific institute for them and they were shifted to other provinces for treatment of complicated illnesses, they added.

Official says federal govt had approved over Rs5bn for the project launched 10 years ago

The director of KICH, Prof Inayatur Rehman, told Dawn that the government had released a total of Rs2.5 billion for the hospital so far. “The remaining funds approved as per revised PC-I are about Rs5.3 billion. We have requested the federal government to release at least Rs500 million before next budget and allocate the remaining amount in the upcoming budget for the hospital,” he said.
He was hopeful that the required funds would be released in a timely manner and they would be able to make functional the 290-bed hospital towards the end of the current year.
“We are in constant contact with the relevant authorities at federal level about the monetary problems that we are facing in completion of the project. They have assured us of all-out cooperation,” said Prof Inayat, a paediatric surgeon.
He said that as for as the progress on the project was concerned, they had completed 70 per cent construction work. He added that they were looking towards the government for funds to complete the project.
“We have applied for electricity connections to Wapda and gas authorities and for laying external sewerage line to Peshawar Development Authority with the request to do these on priority basis,” he said.
About procurement of equipment for the hospital, Prof Inayat said that they were nearing to complete the process of technical and financial evaluation. However, for placement of purchasing orders, they required funds, he said. The time period of revised PC-I would end in June 2023 and they needed to get all the funds before that, he added.
KICH and Children Hospital would act as an umbrella for child health in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The institute has already started activities, including training, teaching and research in the field of child health.
He said that at present, 350 students were undergoing training in different disciplines to help improve children’s health in the province. “With the completion of hospital, we would recruit at least 10 specialists including cardiac, orthopaedic and general surgeons and physicians in different specialties,” he added.
Prof Inayat said that some of the high-tech equipment for state-of-the-art operation theatres would reach the hospital soon. He said that a data bank was being established to help with policymaking and research on children’s health in addition to setting database on paediatric morbidity and mortality.
“Screening programmes for prevention of beta thalassaemia, congenital hypothyroidism and common metabolic disorders and galactosemia are also part of KICH. We will be imparting training to health professionals in child health and they would be deployed in the hospitals of the province,” said Prof Inayat.

“Prices of both fine and super-fine flour varieties have surged by Rs400 per 20kg bag as millers have suspended supply to wholesalers,” Fayyaz Ahmad, an owner of a general store, told reporters on Sunday.
He said traders were astonished when the millers suspended the flour supply to them despite the fact that wheat harvest had begun in Hazara division.
“We are now selling flour bags arriving in the local bazaars through smuggling from Punjab at higher prices because wholesalers charge us extra amounts as truckers have to pay bribes to the officials at checkposts,” he claimed.

Another trader said during the fasting month there was stability in the price of wheat flour as the government had launched the free flour scheme.
He said the Punjab government, despite having a ‘record’ wheat production this season, has put in place a ban on its transportation to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which deteriorated the already fragile situation in the province.

A bench consisting of Justice Mohammad Naeem Anwar and Justice Shahid Khan accepted an appeal filed by the convict, Noorullah, a resident of Dir Lower district, and set aside the sentence of life awarded to him by a trial court on February 2, 2023.
The bench, however, upheld his conviction under Arms Act but reduced his prison term of three years rigorous imprisonment to the period he had already spent in jail.
The FIR of the occurrence was registered at Lal Qilla police station, Dir Lower, on March 19, 2021, under section 302, 311 and 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Two-member bench upholds his conviction under Arms Act

An additional SHO had lodged the complaint stating that he received information that in Asman Banda area a murder of a woman had taken place on pretext of honour.
He stated when he reached the spot, he was informed that the deceased identified as Sajida Bibi had been married to Noorullah around nine years ago and she was having a three-year-old son from the wedlock. He said that Noorullah had also contracted another marriage. He added that Noor and his father Toor Khan suspected that the deceased woman was having relations with another person in the area.
While the trial court had convicted Noorullah, it had acquitted his father of the charges of abetment and instigation. The deceased woman had left behind three legal heirs including her parents and the minor son.
The appellant’s counsel produced a compromise deed under which the parents of the deceased waived their right to Qisas and Diyat, whereas a piece of land worth Rs2.8 million was transferred by Toor Khan in the name of the minor son of the deceased through a registered deed.
The bench turned down stance of an assistant advocate general, Hafiz Ashfaq Ahmad, that the offence of honour killing was non-compoundable, therefore, the appellant, could not be acquitted on basis of a compromise.
The AAG stated that the appellant committed murder of his wife on pretext of honour for which he was also charged under section 311 of Pakistan Penal Code in the FIR.
He said that a proviso to Section 311 PPC provided that if the offence was committed in the name or pretext of honour, the offender should be punished with life imprisonment even if legal heirs of the deceased compounded their right to Qisas.
However, the bench observed that the trial court held that prosecution did not prove the allegation of honour killing against the appellant, as such, he was convicted only under section 302 (b) (intentional murder) of PPC and sentence of life imprisonment was awarded to him as Tazir.
The bench observed that as the trial court did not specifically acquit the appellant from the charge under section 311 PPC, therefore, that aspect of the case needed discussion in the light of the submissions of AAG.
The bench referred to different judgments of Supreme Court, observing that section 311 PPC empowered the trial court to punish an offender under Tazir against whom the right of Qisas was waived or compounded.
The bench observed that the power might be exercised by the trial court in either of two situations: firstly, when all legal heirs of the deceased did not waive or compound their right of Disas; secondly, if the principle of Fasad-Fil-Arz (mischief on earth) was attracted.
The bench ruled that section 311 PPC would be attracted in cases punishable with Qisas and not to cases punishable under Tazir.
The bench also referred to a judgment of the apex court wherein a judgment of Lahore High Court was reversed. The LHC had convicted an accused under section 311 PPC by invoking the principle of Fasad-Fil-Arz although compromise had taken place between the parties.

An official said the personnel of Mohammad Riaz police station stopped a car near the Kohat tunnel, and recovered an anti-aircraft gun, three Kalashnikovs, and 2,700 cartridges during search of it. The police arrested its driver, Mohammad Kaleem, who told interrogators that he was smuggling the weapons from North Waziristan to Darra Adamkhel. A case under the Arms Act was registered against him.
Recently, four policemen of Darra Adamkhel were arrested while carrying mortars, rocket launchers, rocket shells, hand grenades, anti-aircraft guns and cartridges from Orakzai district to Darra. 
SCHOOLS: The dilapidated buildings of a girls and a boys primary school in Seni Gumbat area here pose a serious threat to the lives of about 1,200 students, complained local residents on Sunday, calling for their immediate reconstruction to avoid a major incident.
Sajid Iqbal, chairman of a welfare body in Gumbat, told Dawn on telephone that they had informed the authorities concerned about the bad condition of the school buildings, but no action was taken as yet.
He said the overcrowded buildings with the six-room boys school and seven-room girls school posed a major peril to 1,200 children. He said the students crammed in classrooms as one room each had been allocated for the staff.
He said heads of the schools had compiled reports and sent them to the district office of the education department months ago, but no further action was taken on the reports.
An elder, Malik Ahmed lamented that the priorities of lawmakers and local body members were inaugurating streets, drains, transformers, supply of gas, and roads to muster the support of voters, and not the uplift of the education sector.

19,Veteran artist calls for urgent steps to preserve fast-dying wax art,"Riaz Ahmad says art pieces have great demand locally, internationally","PESHAWAR: Veteran wax artist Riaz Ahmad has expressed concern over fast dying of 500-year-old Mughal-era wax art, and called for urgent steps for its preservation.
He regretted that the authorities’ apathy towards safeguarding this heritage would lead to its complete extinction.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Ahmad, a resident of Peshawar city, said wax art had been in his family for sixth generations, and that he was the last one to have known the basics of this unique artwork.
“I could transfer the art of wax only to my elder son, Fayaz Ahmad, as my other four sons and three daughters have chosen to pursue other careers. Also I had trained two young girls, but unfortunately, they too couldn’t continue after marriage,” he regretted.
The 72-year-old said he had learnt the wax artfrom his father when he was 10. “I did not take up any government job and instead decided to carry on the legacy of this rare art his family had inherited since Mughal-era.”

Riaz Ahmad says art pieces have great demand locally, internationally 

Mr Ahmad said early Mughal rulers had brought the wax art from central Asian states, where his ancestors had added local patterns in Chinese style to the wax art with ‘Peacock’ being the main motif in the Mughal courts.
Riaz Ahmad is the recipient of numerous certificates and awards, including Tamgha-i- Imtiaz in 2012, and ‘Seal of Excellence’ award from Indian government in recognition of his creative artwork.
“I have represented Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in all the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation countries, and so far participated in around 1,500 national and international exhibitions. “I take several hours to complete a single art piece,” he said, adding he was part of the provincial government’s preservation project of old arts, but the initiative was abandoned due to lack of funds.
The veteran artist said he sold one art piece for Rs1, 500 to Rs2, 000 locally, which could fetch more than that in international market. “If properly marketed with official patronage, wax art pieces would bring both dollars and laurels to the country,” he said, claiming he was the lone inheritor of the unique art.
‘Wax art could be done on cotton and silk cloth with natural colours in myriad of mosaics and inlays of different animals – camels, elephants and birds.” However, he said most people placed orders for picture frame, tablecloth, wall hangers, handkerchiefs, handbags and several handicrafts.
“If a workshop is arranged for young girl students on the university campuses, especially for the fine arts departments, I would gladly teach basic techniques of wax art to them as there is rising demand of this art in international market,” he assured.
