Six police personnel, including a senior officer of the Usta Muhammad police station, were martyred last month when a police team from Balochistan conducted an operation for the recovery of Furqan Soomro in the Moladad area of Jacobabad. 
Usta Muhammad SSP Mohammad Hasnain Iqbal and Jacobabad SSP Mohammad Anwar told a presser on Sunday the Balochistan and Sindh police safely recovered the kidnapped man after the successful operation. Mr Soomro was also present at the press conference. 
“We succeeded in the safe recovery of Furqan after a heavy exchange of fire with the dacoits who were demanding huge ransom for his release,” SSP Iqbal said, adding that the operation would continue in the area till the arrest of all kidnappers. 
However, he said, some suspects have been taken into custody during the joint operation and police are interrogating them.

According to officials, Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo on Sunday approved the establishment of e-facilitation centres to streamline work in various departments and provide e-service facilities to citizens under a one-window operation. 
To expand the facility across the province, the IT department has been assigned to identify suitable, abandoned or underutilised buildings through deputy commissioners where civic amenities/e-service centres would be established.
“[These] urban facilitation/e-service centres will be established on the basis of population and geography to provide multiple services under one roof in all districts where different departments will provide different services at the same facility,” a senior IT official said.
He added that facilitation/e-service centres in each district will cost Rs10 million and thus, total funds of about Rs350 million will be required for all 35 district headquarters, except Quetta.

3,literary notes: Delhi’s social geography and Shahjahanabad’s history,"“HISTORY of Urdu literature cannot be comprehended fully unless one understands Delhi, the greatest centre of...","


 
“HISTORY of Urdu literature cannot be comprehended fully unless one understands Delhi, the greatest centre of Indian culture,” writes Prof Sadiqur Rahman Kidwai in his editorial in Jan-Jun 2023 issue of Urdu Adab, a literary magazine published by Anjuman Taraqqi-e-Urdu Hind (ATUH), Delhi.
Situated at important geographical crossroads, Delhi, the centuries-old capital, had indeed been an epicentre of great historical and political upheavals and an eyewitness to cultural and intellectual changes. It was Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan who moved Mughal capital from Agra to Delhi, got a new fort built along with other buildings and named it Shahjahanabad in 1648. Urdu Adab’s just published special issue on the historic town Shahjahanabad, also known as Old Delhi, captures rich history and vibrant culture of Delhi wonderfully well.
Prof Kidwai, the chief editor, president of ATUH and a well-known scholar, says that this special issue is historic as well, since these days literary Urdu magazines have restricted themselves to poetry, fiction and criticism. Unlike past, now Urdu journals do not portray diversity and colourfulness of our culture and civilisation as they used to, adds Kidwai.     
Dr Ather Farouqui, the editor and ATUH’s general secretary, has emphasised in his editorial note that this special issue of Urdu Adab is the first issue of any Urdu periodical on Shahjahanabad, in which the research aspects and principles of historiography have been fully taken care of. And it is, says Dr Farouqui, therefore, “free from the myths concocted and narrated like an episode from Daastaan-i-Ameer Hamza at chaupaals (informal gatherings) and teashops”.
This issue, adds Farouqui, presents texts that are credible and can be taught at history departments of universities. Glancing at the table of contents one can vouch for Farouqui’s claim: the issue includes some scholarly pieces that capture true colours of Delhi’s culture and its history, for instance, Prof Shareef Husain Qasmi has described some historical buildings of Delhi from the era of Amir Khusrau; a keynote address by Prof Irfan Habib sheds light on Delhi’s literary and historical peculiarities; Prof Inayat ali Zaidi has deliberated, with historical evidences, on how and why Rajput girls were married off to Mughal rulers; Prof Ali Nadeem Rizvi has explained Shahjahanabad’s concept of civic life. 
Swapna Liddle in her article ‘Jawaab Kaahe Ko Tha Lajawaabb Thi Dehli’ has beautifully narrated the history of Shahjahanabad and Red Fort and how the city, the bazaar and the other buildings were constructed; and how the city flourished with all its architectural grandeur and cultural vivaciousness even in the reign of Aurangzeb Alamgir, the pious Mughal Emperor who spent a good many years in a campaign to make Deccan subservient to Mughal dynasty. Then she tells us how the city went through the inevitable: the political infighting caused the city to change and so did the fate of the people of Shahjahanabad: riches vanished, clouts waned and Havelis (mansions) were subdivided into small quarters. She in this article has tried to find Delhi’s historical architectural lay out and town planning, but for Delhi’s cultural history she recommends Muraqqa-e-Dehli, a book written in Persian in 1740 and translated into Urdu and English.
Shahjahanabad’s culinary art is discussed by Suhail Hashmi in his article and Dr Sonal traces the tradition of khil’at (the royal robe presented as a gift or reward). Other articles by Ather Farouqui, Syed Noor-ul-Hasan, Sadaf Fatima, too, are much absorbing and informative. Pavan Kumar Varma’s longish article, translated by Ather Farouqui and accompanied by some fascinating colour photos by Sandeep Shankar, brings the old havelis of Delhi to life with all their grandeur and historical background, albeit not without a melancholy feeling that is invoked by their present state of decadence and sorrowful fall from the grace.         
Sair-ul-Manaazil is another work that ATUH has recently published on Delhi and its social history. In his intro to the book Ather Farouqui has succinctly described the book’s background and its significance. The original Persian work, penned by Asgher Ali Baig, also known as Mirza Sangeen Baig, was in a manuscript form and Prof Shareef Husain Qasmi had translated it into Urdu. First published by Delhi’s Ghalib Institute in 1982, Sair-ul-Manazil’s Urdu translation has now been revised by Prof Qasmi and he has also added footnotes to it. With the addition of an index at the back of the book and reproduced images of some paintings of Delhi’s architectural landmarks, the book is almost a new one now. 
Prof Qasmi in his erudite intro has described the details about various manuscripts of the work and discerns that Berlin manuscript must have been committed to writing in 1821. Sangeen Baig, the author, was an eyewitness to the geography and social history of Shahjahanabad and has described with minute details different vicinities, buildings and gardens of the city, says Prof Qasmi. 
ATUH deserves kudos for publishing such remarkable works.

4,PTI to challenge floor-crossing legislation in AJK,"PPP, PML-N deny reaching any understanding on premature dissolution of AJK Assembly","MUZAFFARABAD: Pak­is­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Sunday constituted a three-member committee to take decisions on the party’s course of action vis-à-vis legal and constitutional matters in the ongoing volatile political situation in the territory.
Comprising former senior minister Khawaja Farooq Ahmed, former law minister Sardar Faheem Akhtar Rabbani and former adviser on information Chaudhry Rafique Nayyar, the committee announced it would challenge a clandestinely promulgated ordinance by the Chaudhry Anwarul Haq-led government to “legitimize lotacracy” in the state.
Legal experts said that unlike Pakistan where Article 63-A of the Constitution provided a comprehensive procedure regarding defection of an assembly member, the issue of floor-crossings was dealt in AJK by subordinate legislation.
If a person elected as MLA as a nominee of a political party withdraws himself from that political party he shall stand disqualified from being an MLA from the date of such withdrawal for the remaining period of his term, unless he is re-elected in a by-election held after his disqualification, reads section 31 (3) of the AJK Elections Act, 2020.

PPP, PML-N deny reaching any understanding on premature dissolution of AJK Assembly

The next subsection carries the same penalty for an independent candidate after he joins any political party after his election as MLA.
According to the amended law, which was given retrospective effect from June 24, 2020, the disqualification shall take effect only after the MLA “joins some other party” after withdrawing himself from the party on whose ticket he had returned.
After his election on April 20 as the new leader of the house, Mr Haq in his maiden speech on the floor of the house had declared that he had contested the election for prime minister’s office as an independent candidate (rather than a PTI nominee) with the support of PPP, PML-N and his fellows in the forward bloc.
Political observers were of the opinion that since the PTI forward bloc had defied party policy by joining forces with PPP and PML-N, its members were afraid of losing their seats under section 31 (3) AJK Elections Act, 2020 which was why it had been amended with retrospective effect.
Ex-minister pins hope on court
Mr Ahmed told Dawn that he was quite hopeful of the annulment of the amended law. “That this ordinance is against the spirit of democracy and has been promulgated with mala-fide intent at this point of time is incontrovertible and therefore it’s bound to be quashed by the courts of law,” the former minister asserted while recalling a landmark high court judgement in an identical situation in the late 1980s.
Twelve PTI lawmakers named Mr Ahmed as the new leader of the opposition, but the assembly secretariat is yet to notify him as such. The position is still being held by PPP’s Chaudhry Latif Akbar despite the fact his party is part of the sitting coalition government.
No proposal for snap polls
Meanwhile, both the PPP and PML-N leadership on Sunday denied some TV channels claims that they had reached an understanding to hold snap elections in the state after premature dissolution of the assembly.
“No such proposal is under consideration at any level in our party,” PML-N regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir told Dawn.
He said though since long he had been in favour of holding elections across the country, including AJK and GB, simultaneously, but lately no such debate had been held by his party with any of the other stakeholders.
PPP regional president Chaudhry Mohammad Yasin also expressed his ignorance about any such understanding.  “I don’t think any such thing has been agreed upon. Personally, I want every assembly to complete its constitutional term,” he told Dawn.
Credible sources in both the parties, who spoke to Dawn on condition of anonymity, said Mr Haq was in trouble on the issue of formation of his cabinet “because most of the forward block members wanted the same (important) portfolios they were holding previously”.
“He desperately wants to do away with a constitutional bar to cabinet expansion so that he can strengthen his support based in the Assembly. However, that has become difficult following the PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif’s direction to his party to stay away from any such move,” one source said.
In a tweet, PML-N regional secretary general Chaudhry Tariq Farooq alleged Mr Haq had himself put out a feeler to scare his forward bloc.
“It’s obvious that Mr Haq is under immense pressure from the forward bloc to get the favorite ministries. Therefore, under a plan, such stories are being run through some TV channels to scare the forward bloc and bring it to terms,” he said.
“These reports are far from reality. PML-N has not held any meeting or discussion with the PPP leadership for the dissolution of AJK assembly and general elections in October,” he added.

5,UK police investigate vehicles registered under Nawaz’s name ‘for crime’,"PML-N spokesman terms it a ""malicious attempt by some individuals to tarnish reputation of Nawaz Sharif for criminal purposes"".","London: The registration of three vehicles under the name of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif without his consent or knowledge has prompted an investigation by London police, with the PML-N saying the vehicles could be misused for a crime or for terrorism.
Mr Sharif first came to know about the vehicles falsely registered in his name when the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) sent a letter to his residence at Avenfield House with the registration details of a vehicle attributed to him.
This prompted Mr Sharif’s office to report the activity in March to the DVLA, triggering an investigation.
Khurram Butt, a London-based PML-N spokesperson, revealed that a second incident occurred last month, and that another vehicle was registered under the former prime minister’s name.
A third vehicle under his name was discovered when a traffic violation fine was issued, an act described by Mr Butt as “uncovering a malicious attempt by some individuals to exploit the name and reputation of the PML-N leader for criminal purposes”.
London authorities are pursuing the investigation and following up on all leads to find out who is responsible for registering these vehicles falsely.
The DVLA informed Mr Sharif that his name had been removed from the vehicle registrations, but advised him to pursue the matter with police as it revealed a fraudulent claim made in his name.
The spokesman said he suspected Nawaz Sharif’s name was being deliberately used for wrong purposes, and that he suspected supporters of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf were behind the fraudulent act.

In a tweet, Mr Naqvi said that no one would be allowed to humiliate or threaten the institutions and intelligence agencies.

“I assure that law will take its course and culprits will be held accountable as per law.”
Separately, a social media activist, allegedly associated with  PTI, has apologised for maligning the martyrs of the armed forces on  Twitter, according to APP. 
In a video posted on his Twitter account, which was under a  pseudonym, the individual, hailing from Charsadda, claimed to be an  active social media member of PTI in Dubai. 
He had three fake Twitter accounts and one Facebook account, APP reported. He admitted to using inappropriate language and creating  propaganda against martyrs through his Twitter account and apologised to  the bereaved families.

Speaking to the media in Lahore on Sunday, the minister said the government took “one step backward” to defuse the tension. “But the judiciary took two steps forward, taking the government’s move as a weakness.”
He questioned the chief justice’s discretionary power. “In which fiqah are chief justice’s discretionary powers justified,” the minister asked rhetorically.

8,PTI leader rebuts Elahi’s CM slot claim,"“There has been no discussion at all on this issue at our party’s meetings,” says PTI Lahore chief Sheikh Imtiaz.","LAHORE: A Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader on Sunday denied there had been suggestions during meetings that PTI president Chaudhry Parvez Elahi or his son would become chief minister in case the party wins elections to the Punjab Assembly.
“This talk (if any) is between PTI Chairman Imran Khan and Chaudhry Parvez Elahi as we are unaware of this,” PTI Lahore chief Sheikh Imtiaz told Dawn. “There has been no discussion at all on this issue at our party’s meetings,” he added.
Parvez Elahi said in an interview to a news website on Saturday that Imran Khan had promised to make him or Moonis Elahi chief minister if the party won elections.
Mr Elahi also claimed that he had given in writing a signed copy of the summary on dissolving the provincial assembly, with a copy of his CNIC, to Mr Khan and asked him to write a date of his choice for the assembly’s dissolution.
The former Punjab chief minister held a press conference on Sunday where he reiterated his claims.
Sheikh Imtiaz said he had attended a meeting of the party for award of tickets for Lahore seats, but “I never heard anything about Imran Khan’s promise to Parvez Elahi about the chief minister’s slot”.
“Since our focus is on the campaign for building pressure on the government to hold elections in Punjab on May 14, there has been no discussion about the CM position so far,” he maintained.
Mr Imtiaz said PTI had given tickets to all candidates whose names were approved.
Attempts to obtain comments from PTI’s other leaders like Fawad Chaudhry, Mian Aslam Iqbal and Hammad Azhar on Parvez Elahi’s observations remained unsuccessful.
Chaudhry Parvez Elahi alleged at a press conference at his residence on Sunday that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had gone to London to take fresh instructions from Nawaz Sharif about their ongoing “conspiracies against the judiciary”.
“The PDM-led government is playing havoc with the country. Except for Islamabad, the entire country has been turned into a prison. If anyone wants to stay here, they should get bail,” he quipped.
Mr Elahi further said Nawaz Sharif was an absconder  and that Khawaja Asif “repeats whatever Nawaz Sharif tells him to speak”.
“Mohsin Naqvi (the caretaker chief minister of Punjab) is a puppet in the mould of (former Sindh CM) Jam Sadiq. Mohsin Naqvi’s term has expired, but he and members of his cabinet are still drawing salaries from the exchequer,” Mr Elahi added.
“The court has pardoned the attack on our house, but we have not forgiven anyone. Police took away mobile phones, wallets and even motorcycles of guests present at that time,” the former chief minister alleged.

9,Mystery surrounds ‘blighted property’ notice at Pakistan Embassy,Notice disappears days after it was pasted on building’s front door in the US capital.,"WASHINGTON: The mystery surrounding a Pakistan Embassy building in the US capital got more complicated on Sunday when a notice about its blighted condition disappeared days after it was pasted on the front door.
Since the local government offices in Washington remain closed on Sunday, no one was available to clarify when they pasted the notice and why they removed it.
When Dawn contacted officials at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, they said that “since we never saw the notice, we cannot say when or why it was removed”.
A photo of the “Blighted Property” notice, taken on Friday, said the Building Enforcement Unit of the Department of Buildings (BOD), Washington, “has inspected your property and deemed it to be blighted”.

Notice disappears days after it was pasted on building’s front door in Washington

It asked the owners of the property, Pakistan Embassy, to “complete and submit a blighted building response form, within 30 days” or “your property will be designated as blighted and reclassified accordingly”. The notice also warned that “unauthorised removal” of this red notice could lead to a fine of $500.
Media reports published earlier this week claimed that the Washington DC government had downgraded the property classification of this embassy-owned building on the city’s historic R-Street NW.
 
 

The building has been up for sale for the past few months and received offers much below the prevalent price in this neighbourhood.
The reports warned that the declassification will further reduce the market value of the building while increasing taxes on its assessed value.
The building, which used to be a chancery in the past, was put up for auction late last year. The bidding process was later cancelled by Pakistani authorities, under pressure from the Pakistani American community.
Several community members claimed that they were willing to offer much more than the highest bid of $6.8 million for the property located in the heart of the city. Earlier media reports, however, put the pre-auction evaluation of the building, on ‘as is’ basis, at $4.5m. The building has been unoccupied for over a decade. The building’s diplomatic status was also revoked in 2018, making it liable to pay taxes to the local government.
In 2008, a Washington Post report on blighted properties in Washington listed a “paint-peeled columns and boarded-up windows” of a building owned by the United Arab Emirates, and “the hip-high grass and missing front door knob of a building owned by the Pakistani government.”
In December 2017, the US State Department responded to a plea for action from a local government official, Eleanor Holmes Norton, saying that it was ready to “aggressively engage” foreign countries with derelict properties in the nation’s capital.
In another letter to the local government, a State Department official said buildings owned by several countries, including Pakistan and Argentina, have lost diplomatic protections. A 2018 report in the Washingtonian magazine noted that “a 1906 Beaux Arts beauty, the onetime embassy of Pakistan has been vacant for about a decade — and it shows.
A demolition notice hangs to the left of the front door. Some windows are broken, while others are covered with cobwebs“. The report noted Pakistan has moved its embassy to “expansive new digs” near the Van Ness Metro.
An earlier Associated Press report noted that this “large building at the corner of 22nd and R street in downtown Washington, sticks out like a wart in the otherwise upscale neighbourhood”.
The building’s “plywood covers the windows, sleeping bags and empty bottles litter the shuttered doorways and head-high weeds sprout through the asphalt of the empty fenced-off parking lot,” the report added.

10,Minister sees Imran’s arrest as solution to all problems,Marriyum accuses PTI chief of creating intolerance in society.,"ISLAMABAD: Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb has said that the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan will solve the problems being faced by the country.
Reacting to Mr Khan’s allegations on Sunday, Ms Aurangzeb said the former prime minister should be punished for conspiring against the country and corruption.
She claimed that Mr Khan’s “dirty mentality” was creating intolerance and violence in society. “The country needs food, employment and business, and not fraud, mischief, disorder and distraction being promoted by Mr Khan.” She also held the PTI chief responsible for extremist attitudes in the country which are leading to mob lynchings.
‘Imran playing politics on Kashmir’
Continuing her accusations against Mr Khan, the minister blamed him of playing politics on India and Kashmir and using Islam for “ulterior motives”.

Marriyum accuses PTI chief of creating intolerance in society

She recalled that Mr Khan prayed for the victory of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2019 elections.
Referring to the rallies announced by the PTI chief, Ms Aurangzeb said the agitation had been called at a time when the Chinese foreign minister was visiting Pakistan.
“Imran Khan has called for riots and anarchy after watching the video of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with King Charles,” the minister said.
She added that PM Shehbaz was holding meetings with world leaders, including the King, but Mr Khan couldn’t see it as he was “wearing a black bucket on his head”.
After Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s successful visit to India for the SCO meeting and a befitting response to his Indian counterpart, Mr Khan has “completely lost his cool,” she said, adding that Imran had also spread intolerance in the country. She advised Mr Khan to appear before courts and face cases instead of agitation on the streets.
