0,Health authority launches anti-quackery drive,Quacks thrive in open and organised clinics at the cost of human health,"The District Health Authority (DHA) has swung into action against mushroom growth of quacks on footpaths, roads and streets, and in neighbourhoods of the city and the rest of the district.
These quacks are seen treating eye, tooth, nose, ear, throat, stomach, liver and kidney diseases at the cost of human health. And often uneducated and less-educated segment of society falls prey to these unqualified medical practitioners and so-called herbalists.
The visitors are generally unaware that the quacks don't cure the illness properly and the latter become victims of even more dangerous diseases due to hazardous treatment, non-sterilised instruments, and consumption of spurious medicines. The quakes treat eyes with traditional medical substances, leading to acute infections like visual impairment. Similarly, in the treatment of teeth, the use of non-sterilised equipment and chemicals for cleaning and placing new teeth could expose the patient to the risk of contracting hepatitis.
Similarly, the quacks remove wax from the ears, resulting in the person experiencing heightened sensitivity to sound due to the direct exposure of the ear canal. This heightened sensitivity to sound leads to noise in the ear and deafness.
Such quakes are seen sitting on the footpath in front of the district headquarters hospital in Raja Bazaar, Railway Pori Bridge, Jamia Masjid Road, Saddar Koila Centre, Kabari Bazaar and dozens of other places. They have also set up regular established clinics in the residential areas of the city and cantonment to fleece patients and put their lives in danger.
The Punjab Healthcare Commission (PHC) has also not conducted any significant operation against quackery in the city as a result of which the business of these quacks continues to thrive and those who seek treatment from them become victims of deadly diseases and keep suffering in other hospitals for the rest of their lives.
These overconfident quacks also don’t hesitate to treat diseases of piles, liver and skin through fake medicines. They attract customers with persuasive conversations and display medicinal products like homemade lotions and shining teeth covers. Through their persuasive techniques, these quacks treat patients of teeth, nose and ears quickly and sell the same medicine to the family members of their visitors.
According to health experts, kidney and liver diseases are treated so that the patient's kidneys stop functioning and the liver becomes ineffective. The quacks usually use [unregistered] medicines and herbal powder (Phakki) to treat gastrointestinal diseases.
DHA Chief Executive Dr Ejaz Ahmad says the operations have been launched against quack doctors and practitioners in Potohar Town, Rawalpindi Cantonment, Kotli Sattian, Murree, Kallar Syedan, Kahuta, Taxila, Rawalpindi City and Gujar Khan in the first phase.
As many as 38 inspections have been conducted out of which 10 centres have been sealed and notices have been served to 10 others to initiate proceedings against them.
According to Dr Ejaz, the authority is raising awareness among citizens to avoid quacks and dangerous medical treatments and consult government hospitals in case of any illness.

1,Expats begin returning after Eid break,"Transporters fearlessly charge undue fares, monitoring staff disappears","Amid exorbitant transport fares, a good number of expatriates started returning to the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad on Saturday after the Eidul Fitr holidays.
The transporters remained undeterred in charging undue fares despite public complaints and the intervention of the Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner and the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) secretary to lower the fares.
On Saturday, the last Eid special train departed from Peshawar to Karachi, concluding the series of special trains. The Pakistan Railways operated a total of four Eid special trains this year, with three running before Eid and the final one on the fourth day of the religious festival.
The twin cities experienced a significant surge in passenger traffic at all transportation hubs on Saturday. There had been a noticeable increase in complaints regarding overloaded vehicles and excessive charges. Passengers and transporters exchanged arguments over exorbitant fares and extra fares for luggage and minor children.
Although Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema and the RTA secretary had announced the monitoring of all transport bases and the deployment of staff during the Eid holidays, no monitoring was carried out. The monitoring staff of the administration also went on vacation, allowing transporters to charge fares arbitrarily.
Passengers travelling from Rawalpindi to Lahore, Faisalabad, and Sialkot were charged an extra Rs350, while those heading to Multan, Karachi and Peshawar had to pay Rs500, Rs1,200 and Rs200 for Peshawar respectively. In the wake of high volumes of passengers, local transport buses and wagons operated on longer routes, resulting in a significant reduction in local and intercity transport services. The dearth of public vehicles pushed buses and wagons to charge Rs200 fare between Rawalpindi to Islamabad. The drivers of Qingqi rickshaws also charged fares fearlessly.
The return of people to the twin city will be completed today and from April 15 all courts, government and private offices, and commercial hubs will resume routine working.

2,‘Hero’ teen dies saving kid in Rawalpindi,Osama Khan was trying to rescue a relative,"A young student died while attempting to rescue a relative who had been electrocuted by a metal cord entangled with an electric pole during a kite-flying incident.
Osama Khan, 17, was a Hafiz-i-Quran and the nephew of Ejaz Khan Jazi, the former MPA of PTI and former chairman of the Punjab chief minister's inspection team. Osama had come to his grandmother's house in the Dhok Khaba area of Rawalpindi to celebrate the Eid holidays. When a young boy of a relative was flying a kite on the rooftop and due to the metal wires of a nearby electric pole accidentally coming into contact with exposed electric wires, the child was electrocuted. Osama rushed to rescue him, but unfortunately, he too fell victim to the unforgiving metal wire and received an electric shock.
Immediately, he was rushed to the District Headquarters Hospital, but despite all attempts, he could not be saved and succumbed to his injuries. Subsequently, Osama Khan was laid to rest in the contemporary cemetery of Dhok Elahi Baksh.
Former PTI candidate Senator Nasir Butt, Shehryar Riaz, Hafiz Abdullah Butt, some members of the PPP, PML-N and PTI as well as various workers, leaders and citizens attended the funeral prayers.

3,Pleasant weather draws crowd to parks in Rawalpindi,"Last days of Eid holidays are made memorable by families enjoying indoor games, boating","On the fourth day of Eidul Fitr, the rainfall happening since morning had made the weather very pleasant and had brought back a mild coldness to the atmosphere as well.
The pleasant weather encouraged a large number of families to leave their houses to visit amusement parks.
However, open swings and rides in the parks did not attract many due to the continuous rain. Indoor games, including computerised games, bouncing activities, haunted houses, and mono-train rides were crowded.
A large number of families had come to the parks just to sit in the dense trees to enjoy the rain and pleasant weather while children were busy playing games such as badminton and football while it drizzled. Children were jumping around and enjoying delicious food, such as nimco and various juices. Families also went boating in Ayub Park Lake in the pouring rain.
The crowd of families went on outings despite the rain due to the availability of a variety of indoor games in Ayub Park and Joyland. Children enjoyed indoor rides such as dodging cars, haunted houses and computerised shooting.
The condition of the dams supplying water to the twin cities has also improved due to continuous rain. The catchment areas of the three dams, Rawal, Khanpur and Simly dams have been filled with water. This has also averted the expected water crisis this summer.
The Meteorological Department has predicted rain for Sunday (today) as well. If it continues to rain today as per the forecast of the Meteorological Department, the Eid crowd will not be able to visit parks despite it being the last Eid holiday.

4,Chaklala residents face acute water shortage,Water supply shortfall reaches 5.2 million gallons per day,"The residential population of the Chaklala Cantonment Board (CCB) is facing acute water shortage after supply from the Khanpur Dam and 48 tube wells have been reduced by 50 per cent. The average daily requirement of the CCB and its localities is approximately 35 million gallons of water.
Per the CCB’s data, the shortfall in water supply has reached 5.2 million gallons per day as compared to the daily water demand of 10.12 million gallons. The citizens are facing difficulties due to a decrease in the pressure of the water supply from the Khanpur Dam and depleting underground water levels from several tube wells.
At present, the worst water situation exists in areas of Dheri Hassanabad, Lala, Zar, Tulsa, Lal Kirti, Jhanda Chichi, Tipu Road, Gulistan Colony and Murir Hassan of the CCB, and Azizabad, Afshan Colony, Dhok Chaudharyan, Mughalabad, and Udara areas of the Rawalpindi Cantt.
Abdul Abasit Kayani, who was a candidate for the member Cantonment Ward 3, says several visits to the CCB authorities have proved to be a futile exercise. Women, children and elderly people are facing a very painful situation because they are not getting water, especially in Ramazan.
Chaklala Cantonment Board Member Raja Irfan Imtiaz says water is a basic need and they are facing severe difficulty due to the non-availability of water in the holy month. The issue of increasing water supply from the Khanpur Dam for the CCB areas is being raised in all forums including the board’s meeting, he adds.
CCB Vice President Khalid Mirza says that falling underground water levels and a decrease in water discharge from tube wells and water supply from the Khanpur Dam are core problems.
When the matter was raised at the level of the station commander, it was revealed that the Khanpur Dam’s water supply system is suffering from mismanagement and that water is being supplied to the Rawalpindi Cantt due to misuse of the Chaklala water valve. Despite the installation of the water valve on the Chaklala Cantonment supply line, the mismanagement in water distribution has started again, he added.
Khalid further says the matter once again has been brought to the notice of the station commander with a demand to ensure Chaklala water supply only for Chaklala residents.

5,Northern areas attract thousands on Eid vacations,"Despite torrential rains in K-P, tourists, sports adventurers visit Hazara division","Packed with the baggage of cooked food, fruits and tents for camping at the picturesque Thandyani, Qaiser Khan and his family rejoiced after visiting their dream tourist resort during the Eidul Fitr holidays.
They enjoyed snow games, mountaineering and trekking amid rainy weather conditions.
An ex-Wapda employee, Qaisar and his sons Zershan and Ehtisham, enjoyed national and cultural songs such as ""Sohni Dharti"" and ""Monga da Khyber Zalmi"" on their music system. They were also busy fixing and hammering bolts on tents in a suitable location in Thandyani.
The family was looking forward to enjoying the rainy weather on the weekend without any cost. Amid disappearing sun behind clouds hovering over Thandyani hills amid blossom of seasonal flowers, Qaiser's wife who belonged to Wapda Town Nowshera, was seen preparing green tea on a gas stove after warming up the Peshawar's famous Chappli Kabab, Paye and Polao (rice dish) they brought along and making it ready on 'Dastarkhwan' to serve her family members on Saturday.
""Galiyat is my favourite tourist place. I planned Galiyat's tour a few years ago but postponed it due to travel restrictions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and today dream of my family to see its mesmerising natural beauty with soothing environment came true,"" said Qaiser.
Wearing traditional Peshawari Chappal, the 59-year-old tourist said that he had brought tents and other stuff along as the hotel room and food cost is very high for a common man at Galiyat. ""The rent of a normal two-bedroom per night in Thandyani and Nathiyagali is approximately Rs10,000 to Rs12,000 which was beyond the capacity of the middle class"", he added.
Like Qaiser Khan, thousands of families and tourists arrived at northern Khyber Pakthunkhwa especially Malakand and Hazara divisions including Galiyat and Thandyani to explore its waterfalls, gushing rivers and lakes of Saiful Malook, Ansoo, Dudipath and Mahoodhand and colonial era tracks besides enjoying the expensive trout fish and water boating in River Kunhar at Kaghan and Khanpur dam at Haripur.
""Despite torrential rains in K-P and Punjab, the response of tourists, adventurers and sportsmen in Malakand and Hazara during the Eid holidays was impressive,"" Saad Khan, said the spokesman for the Cultural and Tourism Authority.\
He said that Galiyat, Thandyani and Nathiagali, Kaghan and Naran including Saiful Malook and Ansoo lakes in Manshera district were the most visited destinations during the Eid holidays.
Four Integrated Tourism Zones (ITZ) would be developed at Mankiyal Swat, Thandyani Abbottabad, Ganol Manshera and Madaklasht Lower Chitral, Khan said, adding these ITZs would be constructed with a loan grant of $70 million from the World Bank. He further said that the ITZs of Thandyani and Mankiyal would be connected with Swat and Hazara motorways through link roads that would open up entire Malakand and Hazara for tourists and make Pakistan a hub of international tourism.

7,Anti-dengue drive resumes in low spirit,Punjab health dept has yet to provide anti-dengue kits & spray pumps,"The anti-dengue campaign has kicked off in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad after three weeks’ gap.
After the completion of Ramazan ration distribution, the campaign is moving slowly because of the non-availability of available ingredients. Authorities have planned to enforce the Anti-Dengue Act in Rawalpindi district.
The Punjab health department has yet to provide anti-dengue kits, spray pumps, and spray solutions to the Rawalpindi officials. The number of dengue patients in the district has climbed to six. The recruitment process for 1,500 dengue patrol workers and 300 entomologists in the anti-dengue team is still continuing.
Earlier, the anti-dengue campaign was temporarily halted a week before the start of Ramazan to focus on the distribution of ration bags among the needy as all dengue patrol workers were included in the free ration squad.
With the dry season approaching in Rawalpindi next week following recent rains, concerns grow among the officials and citizens about the breeding and spread of dengue larvae.
The anti-dengue campaign has resumed at a slow pace after several anti-dengue workers obtained leaves due to their involvement in the ration distribution campaign. On the other hand, anti-dengue meetings are also being resumed. Deputy Commissioner Hassan Waqar Cheema has given strict orders to continue the campaign throughout the Eid holidays with a special plan.
From January 1 to March 28, a total of 195 houses in Rawalpindi were found to have dengue larvae during inspections. During this period, 33 cases were filed, 35 properties were sealed, 78 challans were issued, and a total fine of Rs115,000 was imposed. However, due to a lack of workers, prompt action against 79 source reports, indicating a high presence of dengue larvae, couldn’t be taken despite passing two weeks. There are reports of increased larvae presence in those areas.
All under-construction buildings, plazas, ponds, cemeteries, self-growing five-foot weeds, hemp, and bushes in Rawalpindi have been declared breeding grounds for dengue larvae and mosquitoes. The DC has issued orders to the Chief Officer of the Municipal Corporation to immediately trim bushes and hemp plants and spray them with poison. Furthermore, strict directives have also been issued to promptly dispose of rainwater from tyre shops, junkyards, containers, and discarded tyres.
The DC has instructed the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the District Education Authority (DHA) to address issues such as water leakage from roofs, standing water in grounds and pots, and cutting overgrown grass in both government and private schools.
Additionally, the establishment of special dengue wards in allied hospitals has been ordered soon. The DC has further asked all the concerned departments to provide updated reports of the ongoing anti-dengue campaign. A strict order has also been issued to start the third-party checking of dengue larva search daily. If larvae are discovered during these inspections, action will be taken against the field teams that declared the areas clear.
