Testifying before the court last week during the jail trial of former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi, a patwari of Circle Mohra Noor (Banigala) said: “The land measuring 240 kanals, six marlas situated at Moza Mohra Noor was transferred from the name of Bahria Town through Ahmed Ali Riaz Malik, son of Malik Riaz Hussain, in the name of Farhat Shahzadi.”
 
 

The witness also produced certified copies of 14 mutations through which the land was transferred in the name of Bahria Town from different landowners.
The official testified that “the land measuring 100 kanals, one marla was transferred in the name of Farhat Shahzadi against the consideration of Rs250,125,000 while the land measuring 100 kanals, five marlas was transferred in the name of Farhat Shahzadi for the consideration of Rs250,625,000… the land measuring 40 kanals was transferred in the name of Farhat Shahzadi for the consideration of Rs32,000,000”.

Prosecution witness in £190m graft reference says names of Imran, his wife not mentioned in land transfer

The witness, however, stated that “as per record, the names of accused Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi and Bushra Imran are not mentioned there as witnesses or in any manner whatsoever”.
According to Imran Khan’s counsel, Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry, the statement of the prosecution witness exonerated the former premier and his spouse from the corruption charges.
It may be mentioned that Farah Khan is an absconder in this case.
As per the reference filed in the accountability court, Shahzad Akbar, another absconder, had on Dec 2, 2019 presented a note to then PM Imran Khan, which revealed that on the application of UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), an account freezing order (AFO) was granted by the district judge of the Westminster’s Court. The AFO pertained to £20m.
On Aug 12, 2019, the NCA had obtained eight AFOs in relation to £119.7m held in the accounts of Malik Riaz’s family. The NCA investigation also included 1 Hyde Park Palace, London, a prime property valued at approximately £50m.
The reference put the estimated combined value at £190m. It alleged that in April 2019, Bahria Town had extended illegal monetary benefit to Imran Khan in the shape of land measuring 458 kanals, four marlas and 58 square feet through Mr Bukhari, “disguised under the garb of donation to Al Qadir University Project Trust for which Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi was the settler/founder and Bushra Imran Khan was the trustee”.
The reference alleged that Mr Khan and Mr Akbar connived with each other to give legal cover to £171.15m transferred to Malik Riaz.
The National Accountability Bureau has already issued warrants for Imran Khan, Shahzad Akbar, Zulfi Bukhari and Farah Khan.
“Mr Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, the former prime minister of Pakistan, played a pivotal role in illicit transfer of funds meant for the state of Pakistan into an account designated for the payment of land by Bahria Town, Karachi,” read the reference.
It added: “Few participants who appeared during the investigation revealed that when discussion in the agenda was started by the members, accused No. 1 Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, chairing the cabinet meeting, intervened to grant approval without further discussion upon which the agenda was approved.
“In exchange, for these illegal favours…Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi obtained material monetary gain, including a so-called donation of approximately 458 kanals of land, funds amounting to Rs285m, in kind of contribution to Al-Qadir University Project.”
Shahzad Akbar is accused of misusing his position as chairman of the Assets Recovery Unit (ARU) for extending undue benefit to Malik Riaz.
The reference alleged that lawyer Ziaul Mustafa Nasim aided, abetted and assisted Mr Akbar in the commission of the offence.
The reference stated that Malik Riaz “in his capacity as the CEO/Director of Bahria Town (Private) Limited, actively aided, abetted and assisted in conspiracy with the co-accused persons for the diversion of funds earmarked for the state of Pakistan into a bank account designated for the payment of Bahria Town Limited, Karachi”.
The reference accused Ahmed Ali Riaz of conniving with his father, Imran Khan and Shahzad Akbar and transferring 240 kanals, six marlas land in the name of Farah Khan. It also accused Mr Bukhari of being a “front man” of Imran Khan.

1,Opposition kick-starts anti-govt campaign from Balochistan,"Six-party Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) includes PTI, SIC, MWM, JI, Mehmood Achakzai's PkMAP and Akhtar Mengal's BNP-M.","QUETTA: Launching a countrywide movement against the government from Pishin in Balochistan on Saturday, the central leaders of six opposition parties’ alliance underlined the need for a joint struggle for making Pakistan a true democratic state and restoring the rule of law and Constitution.
The Pishin deputy commissioner had imposed Section 144 on Friday after the announcement of the grand alliance — Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — banning its first public meeting in the district.
However, the meeting was held and no hurdle was created by the administration.
Addressing the participants at Taj Lala Stadium, the leaders of the six-party alliance said Pakistan belongs to all linguistic groups, including Baloch, Pashtoon, Punjabi and Sindhi, and they are the real owner of the country.

Leaders of six-party alliance stress joint struggle for ‘true democracy, rule of law and Constitution’

Leaders of the alliance, including PkMAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, BNP-M chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal, PTI leaders Omar Ayub Khan and Sher Afzal Marwat, Sunni Ittehad Council Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Majlis Wahdat Muslimeen Chairman Raja Nasir Abbas and Jamaat-i-Islami leader Dr Attaur Rehman, addressed the rally.
Omar Ayub, the PTI secretary general, said the alliance is embarking on jihad for protection of the Constitution and democracy.
He claimed that the Balochistan government had imposed a ban on their activities in the province and party workers and flags are being targeted and suppressed. He said that had the PTI been allowed to secure its “mandate under Form-45”, it would have formed government in the Centre. He alleged that hundreds of PTI workers and leaders are being unlawfully detained.
 






The PTI leader demanded that CCTV footage of the May 9 events be released, as it will reveal the truth, adding that the alliance’s objective is to ensure the supremacy of the Constitution and rule of law in the country.
Mehmood Achakzai said: “We say murdabad [death] to those who do not accept supremacy of the Constitution of Pakistan and our alliance has launched a movement for its implementation and protection.”
He said the Constitution is a binding force for the country and under it all citizens should be given equal rights. Indirectly criticizing the politics of electables, he said “seasonal birds” have no importance in the eyes of the people of Balochistan.
“The leaders of all political parties took oath that they will not accept such seasonal birds in their parties,” Mr Achakzai said, adding that whatever Imran Khan was in the past, but today he is the strongest candidate of parliament.
He said the ‘Form-47 government’ cannot run the affairs of the country and with the passage of time they will destroy the economy as they have no ability to deal with the issues facing the country.
Akhtar Mengal said: “We reject the legitimacy of the ‘Form-47 government’ and of Article 144. Our struggle will persist until constitutional supremacy is restored.”
He questioned the efficacy of repressive measures, wondering “how can Section 144 deter political activism that even natural calamities cannot suppress”. He said the political workers fought against the toughest martial law.
Sher Afzal, Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Raja Nasir Abbas and Dr Attaur Rehman said that despite hurdles created by the government in the way of “our struggle, we will succeed in our goal and will protect the Constitution for ensuring the rights of the people and rule of law and Constitution in the country.

2,Quetta-bound cargo train derails near Taftan,Derailment suspends Pak-Iran rail operations; PR chief says possibility of terror attack can’t be ruled out; two other mishaps in past week.,"

• Derailment suspends Pak-Iran rail operations
• PR chief says possibility of terror attack can’t be ruled out
• Two other mishaps reported over past week, disrupting Railways’ Eid services
LAHORE: A Quetta-bound cargo train derailed on Saturday near Tozgi station, around 70km from Taftan town on the Pak-Iran border, suspending rail operations between the two countries.
The goods train, with some passenger coaches attached, was loaded with phosphate and travelling from Iran towards its destination in Pakistan, Pakistan Railways (PR) CEO Amir Ali Baloch told Dawn.
The harrowing derailment significantly damaged the locomotive, a staff rest coach and a few wagons. Authorities fear that this was a terrorist attack, with the PR CEO saying that the possibility “cannot be ruled out”.
 
 

Mr Baloch said the incident was being probed in view of the killings in Noshki, where gunmen shot and killed nine men on Friday night after abducting them from a bus. Besides, militants also damaged a portion of a track near Noshki a day ago, he said.
He said an inquiry had been ordered to assess the causes of derailment. To a question, he said the train was slightly speeding when it was derailed.
He said the damaged track where the derailment occurred would be repaired as soon as PR workers access the area, which was currently cordoned off.
The Taftan derailment was one of at least three major accidents that occurred over the past week, a busy period for the organisation as it runs special trains to transport people travelling to celebrate Eidul Fitr with their families.
In an accident last week, the Peshawar-bound Rehman Baba Express collided with a dumper truck near Faisalabad during the late hours of Sunday, according to reports.
The truck, crossing the railway line at an unmanned level crossing at the Pakka Anna-Gojra section, was cut into halves due to the intensity of the crash.
The engine driver and his assistant received serious injuries, while the locomotive and a passenger coach also suffered massive damage. The rescue teams had to cut through the locomotive’s body to take out the driver and his assistant.
The accident suspended rail traffic on the Khanewal-Faisalabad section for hours, delaying trains’ arrival at the Faisalabad station.
The third accident took place on Friday when a coach of the Karachi-bound Allama Iqbal Express caught fire near Sargodha. According to reports, the train was crossing Sahiwal Junction when a Railway Police head constable spotted fire underneath carriage No. 6.
Eyewitnesses said that after spotting the fire, Muhammad Amin Sindhu rushed to the assistant station master’s office, who forcefully stopped the train by raising a red signal within the outer signal range.
Some passengers had jumped off the moving train at Sahiwal station before it was stopped, eyewitnesses said.
Later, the PR police safely disembarked the passengers and put out the fire. The damaged carriage was taken to the yard, and the train left for its destination after a delay of one and a half hours.
Mismanagement, overloading
The PR operations suffered not only due to accidents but also mismanagement, which resulted in severe distress for passengers.
On Thursday, several passengers travelling in the Rawalpindi-bound Rawal Express claimed that people without tickets occupied the seats of passengers who had confirmed reservations. They alleged that the staff allowed ticketless passengers on the train, causing severe inconvenience for those travelling with a ticket.
The PR also had to face embarrassment when a video went viral a couple of days ago, showing a Railways Police constable beating a woman passenger and her children in a moving train.
Reportedly, the incident took place in Millat Express, where Constable Meer Hasan assaulted the passenger. After the incident’s video went viral, the higher-ups of Railways Police intervened and arrested the constable.
A case was also registered at the Hyderabad Railways Police Station, but the accused was released after he secured bail from the court.

Bouquets were presented to the visiting pilgrims on behalf of the ETPB chairman.
According to ETPB spokesperson Amir Hashmi, 2,400 Indian Sikh pilgrims arrived on Saturday to attend the Baisakhi festival starting from Sunday (today).
After crossing the Wagah border, the pilgrims were hosted by the ETPB, which hired a train from Pakistan Railways to take the visitors directly to Hassanabdal.
Mr Hashmi said the Indian Sikhs were transported to Hassanabdal by train for the first time after the upgrade of the Hassanabdal Railway Station.
Talking to reporters at the Wagah border, the visiting Sikh group leader Kulant Singh and Amarjit Singh said they were very happy to come to Pakistan. They said Indian Sikhs were eager to come to Pakistan to visit their holy places. They stressed a hassle-free visa process for the Sikh pilgrims.
Rana Shahid said that on the order of ETPB Chairman Arshad Farid Khan, adequate arrangements had been made to ensure security of the pilgrims, as well as to provide  accommodation, transport, and medical facilities for them. He said Panja Sahib had been decorated with new colours, decorations and electric lights. He said the officers and security staff of the ETPB were busy serving the pilgrims.
The main event of the Baisakhi (Vaisakhi) Mela will be held at the Gurdwara Panja Sahib Hassanabdal. The Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi had issued 2,975 visas to the Sikh pilgrims to participate in the annual festival here.
According to the ETPB, over 10,000 local and foreign Sikh pilgrims will participate in the main event. Other foreign Sikh pilgrims have arrived from Canada, the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand.
Baisakhi marks the first day of the month of Vaisakh in the Punjabi calendar. This year, it will be celebrated in April. It is not only the spring festival in the region but also marks the founding anniversary of ‘Khalsa’. Baisakhi is also the formal founding day of Sikhism as established by Guru Gobind Singh — 10th Guru of the Sikhs.
During their stay in Pakistan, the Indian pilgrims would also visit other gurdwaras in Punjab. They will return to their country on April 22.
The Sikh pilgrims from India visit Pakistan for the birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak in November, Baisakhi in April and Kartarpur Sahib as well as the death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in June and July.
They visit Pakistan to observe the death anniversary of Sikh Guru Arjun Dev also in June and Saka Nankana Sahib in February. Visas are issued to the pilgrims from India under the framework of the Pakistan-India Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines of 1974.

5,PM Shehbaz lauds Saudi help in times of need,Welcomes delegation led by Muslim World League's secretary general; surprises audience by delivering part of his speech in Arabic.," 

Muslim World League Secretary General Sheikh Dr Mohammad bin Abdul Karim Al-Issa meets Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, on Saturday.—APP

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has lauded Saudi Arabia’s help for Pakistan in times of need, saying it was a testament to the kingdom’s deep love and affection.
While addressing a ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the Seerat Museum in Islamabad on Saturday, the PM said during his visit to the kingdom earlier this month, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman agreed to extend cooperation with Pakistan in the fields of trade, investment, agriculture and industry.
PM Shehbaz said a high-level Saudi Arabian delegation would visit Pakistan soon, adding that the kingdom’s leadership “exhibited deep love and affection for Pakistan”.
He thanked Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdul Aziz and the crown prince for extending support for the Seerat Museum.
“People of Pakistan would never forget the adoration of Saudi Arabia’s leadership,” the PM said, adding that landmarks like the Faisal Mosque in Islamabad were a testament to the friendship.
While talking about the Seerat Museum, the PM said it would help counter adverse effects of Islamophobia and spread knowledge about the teachings and life of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).
The prime minister said ideological divides had been created in the world, resulting in negative propaganda against Islam and the Holy Prophet (PBUH).
“This negative attitude had created hate and divisions,” he remarked, adding that the museum would raise awareness about the life, character and teachings of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and educate people on how to live their lives.
During his address, the PM surprised the audience by delivering part of his speech in Arabic. He welcomed the visiting delegation and said Pakistan was “their second home”.
Earlier, the PM lauded Muslim World League (MWL) Secretary General Sheikh Dr Mohammad bin Abdul Karim Al-Issa for his guidance and support for the Seerat Museum project.
While welcoming the Saudi delegation led by Dr Al-Issa, the prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s continued support for and partnership with the MWL.
Dr Al-Issa had called on Mr Sharif at the Prime Minister’s House on Saturday and discussed matters of mutual interest.
PM Sharif also appreciated the International Islamic Relief Organisation — a charity founded by the MWL — for its welfare work around the world.
He appreciated the valuable contributions and services of Dr Al-Issa for promoting the true image of Islam around the world.
He also acknowledged the critical role of MWL in developing unity among the Ummah, advocating for Muslim causes around the world, and spreading the message of peace, tolerance, and interfaith harmony.
The MWL secretary general praised the prime minister for his commitment and efforts to further strengthen ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. He congratulated the prime minister on the success of his recent visit to Saudi Arabia.
