SCOTTIE Scheffler of the US hits his approach on the ninth hole during the second round of the Masters at the Augusta National Golf Club.—Reuters

 
AUGUSTA: Bryson DeChambeau, Max Homa and Scottie Scheffler weathered a wild windy day seldom seen at Augusta National to share the Masters second-round lead on Friday while Tiger Woods targeted a sixth Green Jacket after claiming another major record.
First-round leader DeChambeau had looked poised to spend another night alone atop the leaderboard until a bogey at the 18th left the 2020 US Open champion with a one-over 73 and a two-day total of six-under 138.
Scheffler also had a chance to take solo possession of top spot, the world number one cruising along with a one-shot lead until running into trouble where so many have at par five 13th.
Landing his approach in Rae’s Creek, Scheffler did well to escape with bogey, then playing error free to the finish signing for an even par 72.
Homa, who had never broken 70 at Augusta until wrapping up his weather-delayed first round on Friday morning with a five-under 67, was quickly back out on the course and on the move with birdies at the second and fourth.
From there the 33-year-old American went into full damage control mode, carding 13 pars and a single bogey to happily sign for a one-under-71 as gusting winds and firming conditions limited scoring chances.
Masters debutant Nicolai Hojgaard of Denmark continued to display nerves of steel, battling to a one-over 73 to sit alone in fourth at four-under with Australian Cam Davis (72) and Collin Morikawa (70) one further back.
Only eight players managed to break par on a sun-kissed day of devilish winds that most said they had never experienced before at Augusta National.
At times golfers appeared to be playing in a sandstorm, the wind whipping up clouds of sand from the bunkers.
“It was extremely challenging,” said Scheffler.  “The winds were up very high, and it blows from everywhere out here.
“I couldn’t really describe how windy it is and how difficult the gusts are just because I think you have to be out there and experience it.”  As always the spotlight was on Woo­­ds as he scrapped his way to an even par 72, securing him a record 24th consecutive made cut at Augusta National.
The 15-time major winner has made a career of proving doubters wrong and did so again behind a performance of pure grit, grinding out a midway total of one-over 145 to easily clear the six-over cut line.
Woods has a long list of magical Masters moments and conjured up one more on Friday, and then immediately set a new target — a record-equalling sixth Green Jacket.
“I’m in the ball game,” said Woods.  “I have a chance going into the weekend. I’m here.
“I have a chance to win the golf tournament.”
The 48-year-old arrived at the year’s first major facing a challenge that was certain to test his will and injury-battered body, the most recent ankle surgery last April. Coming into Augusta, Woods had played just 24 holes this year and had to play nearly as many on a marathon Friday that began with completing the last five holes of his weather-delayed opening round for a one-over 73, followed immediately by another 18.
Under brilliant blue skies, Woods was clearly up for the fight and he mixed four birdies with the same number of bogeys through a rollercoaster round.
Rory McIlroy’s bid to complete the career Grand Slam remains alive but just barely after the Northern Irishman laboured to a five-over 77 that did not include a single birdie.
The world number two finished with a two-day total of four-over to sneak in under the six-over cut but was not ready to wave the white flag even if a massive 10 back of the lead.
“I won from 10 back in Dubai at the start of the year,” said McIlroy.  “I still think I can go out [tomorrow] and shoot a low one, get back into red numbers, and have half a chance going into Sunday.”
Jon Rahm was not quite as optimistic at a successful defence of this Masters crown after the Spaniard returned a 76 to leave him trailing by 11 strokes.
“It’s about as hard a golf course as I’ve seen in a very long time,” said Rahm.  “Hopefully I can just make up some ground tomorrow.”
Some high-profile names were headed home early from the year’s first major.
Former Masters champions Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Sergio Garcia were among the casualties, as were reigning US Open champion Wyndham Clark and 2023 British Open winner Brian Harman.

1,"Five-star Man City go top of Premier League, Tottenham smashed by Newcastle",Newcastle are 10 points adrift of Tottenham and Villa with six games remaining.,"MANCHESTER: Manche­ster City moved to the top of the Premier League as lowly Luton were eased aside 5-1 at the Etihad, while Newcastle thras­hed Tottenham 4-0 on Saturday.
Amid a gruelling schedule, Pep Guardiola could hardly have wished for a kinder fixture in between the two legs of his side’s Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid.
Guardiola made six changes from a thrilling 3-3 draw in the Spanish capital on Tuesday and City seemed set for a stress-free afternoon from the moment they opened the scoring after just two minutes.
Erling Haaland’s shot deflected in off the unfortunate Daiki Hashioka into his own net.
Yet the floodgates refused to open as the English champions had to wait until after the hour mark before making the points safe when Mateo Kovacic smashed in Julian Alvarez’s cross at the edge of the box.
Haaland scored five then the sides met in the FA Cup in February.
The Norwegian had to settle for just one time this time when scored from the penalty spot for his 20th Premier League goal of the season.
Ross Barkley netted a late consolation for Luton but they have just five games left to save their top-flight status.
Jeremy Doku fired into the far corner after jinking through the Luton defence before Josko Gvardiol scored his second goal in a week after opening his City account in Madrid.
Victory takes City two points clear of Arsenal and Liverpool, who both have a game in hand, and are in action on Sunday.
Liverpool host Crystal Palace at Anfield looking to bounce back from their shock Europa League defeat to Atalanta.
Arsenal entertain Aston Villa, who moved back into the top four without kicking a ball on Saturday thanks to Tottenham’s trouncing at St. James’ Park.

ISAK DOUBLE
Alexander Isak scored twice, while Anthony Gordon and Fabian Schar were also on target as the Magpies moved up to sixth and kept their slim chances of Champions League football next season alive.
Newcastle are 10 points adrift of Tottenham and Villa with six games remaining but have the far easier run-in.
“We’ve just got to keep doing our bit which is trying to win every game,” said Newcastle boss Eddie Howe.
“We’re hopefully returning to somewhere near our best and we’ve got to keep heading in that direction.” 
At the bottom of the table, Nottingham Forest edged one point clear of the bottom three after a thrilling 2-2 draw against Wolves.
Matheus Cunha struck twice for the visitors at the City Ground to deny Forest a vital three points after goals from Morgan Gibbs White and Danilo had put them 2-1 in front.
Brentford’s first win in 10 games pulled the Bees seven points clear of the drop zone as Ollie Arblaster’s own goal and Frank Onyeka earned a 2-0 victory over Sheffield United.
Burnley’s chances of survival are fading fast after a 1-1 draw at home to Brighton left them still second bottom, six points adrift of safety.

2,Nadal to make ATP return next week in Barcelona,"Nadal, who turns 38 in June, will be looking for a problem-free return.","PARIS: Rafael Nadal will make his return to ATP competition for the first time since January when he plays Flavio Cobolli in the Barcelona Open next week.
The 22-time Grand Slam champion has played just once, in an exhibition match, since he felt a hip injury flare-up during his quarter-final defeat by Jordan Thompson in the Brisbane Open.
Nadal, who turns 38 in June, will be looking for a problem-free return as he builds towards seeking a record-extending 15th French Open title — it runs from May 20 to June 9.
The tournament has also been boosted by the return of Nadal’s compatriot Carlos Alcaraz, the world No. 3, who withdrew from this week’s Monte Carlo Masters due to a right arm injury.
Unlike Nadal, who has a wild card invite, the two-time defending Barcelona champion gets a first-round bye due to being seeded.
Nadal was smiling when he appeared at Saturday’s press conference alongside the organisers and seeing his name in the draw.
Nadal has never played 63rd ranked Cobolli, 16 years his junior. If he gets past him, he will face the tougher task of Australian Alex De Minaur in the second round.
There is the prospect of a tantalising semi-final meeting with Alcaraz on the centre court which now bears Nadal’s name following his 12 victories in the tournament.
A video was released early afternoon showing Nadal training, seemingly moving with ease and inflicting a 6-1 thrashing on Russia’s Andrey Rublev.
Nadal missed virtually all of the 2023 season through injury and has only played at the Brisbane International this season.
The injury in Brisbane prompted his withdrawal from the Australian Open as well as Doha and Indian Wells, where he had first intended to make his comeback.
His one appearance since Brisbane came in an exhibition match against Alcaraz in Las Vegas in March where observers noted some discomfort in his back.
With this potentially Nadal’s last year on tour, he will be desperate not to miss any more clay court preparation time for the French Open.

3,"Mohammad Hafeez, domestic cricketers await dues from PCB",Sources says Hafeez has not received any payments from the PCB for his brief tenure as cricket team director.,"LAHORE: Signs suggest that Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi is hesitant to release payments owed to Mohammad Hafeez for his stint as former team director of the national side, as well as payments due to domestic cricketers who participated in various tournaments last year. This hesitation appears to stem from the fact that all these activities were conducted under the supervision of Mohsin’s predecessor Zaka Ashraf.
Sources disclosed to Dawn that neither Hafeez has received any payments from the PCB for his brief tenure as team director, which began on Nov 16, 2023, and concluded on Feb 16, 2024, nor have the domestic cricketers received their dues.
Hafeez was appointed as team director by the Zaka after Mickey Arthur was removed from the post due to the team’s poor performances in the Asia Cup and the World Cup last year.
Zaka, serving as chairman of the PCB’s interim Management Comm­ittee, also recommended Hafeez’s appointment to then caretaker Prime Minister Anwar-ul-Haq for approval as team director for four years. However, Zaka’s recommendation did not receive approval before his resignation from his post.
During Hafeez’s tenure as team director, the Pakistan’s performance on tours to Australia and New Zealand was disappointing. They suffered defeats in all three Test matches against Australia and faced a 4-1 defeat in the five-match T20I series against New Zealand.
Zaka resigned just before the conclusion of the tour of New Zealand due to a lack of full decision-making authority. Unfortunately, Zaka’s departure has left Hafeez awaiting his overdue salaries and other entitlements.
Sources indicate that the paperwork for Hafeez’s payment has been prepared and awaits approval from the relevant authorities. However, there may be a discrepancy between the PCB and Hafeez regarding the duration of payment. Hafeez began his role on Nov 15, 2023, and concluded his last assignment with the New Zealand tour on Jan 21, 2024.
The transition from Zaka’s tenure to Mohsin’s leadership saw Hafeez being informed on Feb. 6 that his services were no longer required. In response, Hafeez expressed his disappointment via a post on X, stating, “I accepted the new role as team director with great enthusiasm to bring about positive reforms. Unfortunately, my designated tenure, offered by the PCB for 4 years, was cut short by 2 months due to the change in chairmanship.”
Furthermore, the PCB has yet to settle the match fees owed to players who participated in the last National T20 Cup, National U-19, and National U-16 cricket tournaments last year.
Interestingly, payments for participants in the Ramadan Cup, held in Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad during the holy month of Ramazan, were promptly cleared by the PCB.
This prioritisation of the Ramadan Cup payments over those owed for the aforementioned tournaments has sparked concern among both regional cricket associations and players, according to sources. Additionally, prize money from domestic tournaments held during Zaka’s tenure also remain outstanding.

4,"PCB issues show-cause notices to Tauseef, Qaiser",LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) domestic cricket department has decided to issue show-cause notices to...,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) domestic cricket department has decided to issue show-cause notices to former Test bowler and ex-member of the national selection committee Tauseef Ahmad, and Qaiser Abbas, a coach of the Islamabad Cricket Region and a former international cricketer. They are being reprimanded for not fully adhering to the new policy of including some U-19 players in the Challenge Cup Tournament, designated for seniors and commencing from April 15.
Sources informed Dawn that Khurram Niazi, the department head, expressed dissatisfaction when Tauseef, acting as selector, omitted U-19 players from the Rawalpindi and Islamabad regional cricket teams for the aforementioned Challenge Cup. 
Qaiser, serving as the coach of the Islamabad Region, also contested the PCB’s directive. Sources revealed that Qaiser argued with the domestic department, contending that it was unfair to integrate U-19 players into the senior team, given that junior players were scheduled to participate in a separate U-19 district tournament starting from May 10. However, Khurram disagreed and instructed his subordinate to issue show cause notices to both Tauseef and Qaiser Abbas.
In response, Tauseef, in his written reply, contested Khurram’s decision, asserting that he had not been informed of the directive to include U-19 players when he was finalizing the teams. Tauseef is no longer a member of the national selection committee since the appointment of the new PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, who established a seven-member national selection committee. 
Additionally, it has come to light that Wajahat Ullah Wasti, a former national selector, also selected some regional teams and clashed with the domestic department over other issues, although he is not currently serving as a selector. Furthermore, Zahoor Elahi, a former Test cricketer, and member of the PCB coaches’ panel, incurred Khurram’s displeasure for failing to attend a scheduled Zoom meeting organised by Khurram online from Saudi Arabia the other day.
The primary objection raised by coaches and selectors regarding the inclusion of U-19 players stems from the concern that it would be a futile exercise. They argue that since the Challenge Cup essentially serves as a trial to select teams for the senior district cricket tournament, wherein no U-19 player is eligible to participate (as they are slated to play separately in the U-19 tournament starting from May 10), U-19 players included in the Challenge Cup teams are merely taking the place of deserving over-19 players.
Meanwhile, it has been learned that although regional cricket associations had requested the domestic department to postpone the start of the Challenge Cup from April 15 to April 20 due to the challenges of preparing the grounds after a five-day holiday period (three for Eid-ul-Fitr and two weekly offs) ending on April 14, the PCB domestic department disregarded these requests, and the tournament will proceed as scheduled from April 15.

5,Djokovic into record 77th Masters semi-final at Monte Carlo,MONTE CARLO: Novak Djok­ovic reached a record 77th Masters semi-final on Friday when he defe­ated Australia’s...,"MONTE CARLO: Novak Djok­ovic reached a record 77th Masters semi-final on Friday when he defe­ated Australia’s Alex de Minaur in straight sets in Monte Carlo as in-form Jannik Sinner racked up his 25th victory of the year.
Djokovic, the 36-year-old world number one came through a roller-coaster quarter-final to win 7-5, 6-4 and make the last-four in the principality for the first time since 2015 when he went on to claim his second title at the tournament.
Djokovic, the oldest man to make the Monte Carlo semi-finals in the Open Era, will take on Casper Ruud of Norway for a place in Sunday’s championship match.
“It was tough for both of us. He is one of the quickest players on tour. He gets a lot of balls back that normally 99 percent of other players don’t,” said Djokovic who avenged his loss to De Minaur at the United Cup in January.
“He did not surprise me with sev­e­ral passing shots. Particularly in the second set when I was up a break.
“But he said at the net it was ugly. The second set I think it was. We didn’t play at the high level and made a lot of unforced errors, him and I, and a lot of breaks of serve. It is kind of expected on clay but maybe not this many. But a win is a win and I am happy to be through.” The other semi-final sees Australian Open champion and world number two Jannik Sinner face two-time Monte Carlo winner Stefanos Tsitsipas.
Sinner took his 2024 record to 25 wins and just one loss with a gruelling 6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3 victory over 2023 runner-up Holger Rune.
Greek 12th seed Tsitsipas bree­zed past Karen Khachanov of Russia 6-4, 6-2.
Djokovic had appeared on course for a comfortable afternoon under the sweltering Riviera sun against 11th seeded De Minaur.
After pocketing the first set, he was quickly 2-0 ahead in the second.
However, five successive breaks of serve followed as the top seed saw leads of 3-1 and 4-2 retr­ieved by his opponent who clawed back to 4-4.
Djokovic held for 5-4 and secured his fifth break of the match in the 10th game to claim victory in just over two hours and move two wins away from a 41st career Masters title.
Sinner kept his cool as Rune lost his in a two-hour 40-minute marathon.
Rune, who will drop out of the top 10 next week, was warned by the chair umpire for unsporting behaviour after a sarcastic gesture to the crowd in the second set.
He was booed even more when he sat down and demanded the supervisor be called.
The 20-year-old Dane regained his composure, saving two match points to take the tie to a decider.
However, Sinner moved smartly into his fifth semi-final of 2024, gaining revenge for his loss to Rune in the last-four in Monte Carlo 12 months ago.
“One can try and create a little bit of chaos,” said Sinner of Rune’s antics. “That is no problem. I learned from last year. That is all part of the learning process.”
Tsitsipas, winner of the Monte Carlo title in 2021 and 2022, needed just 81 minutes to record his eighth win in nine meetings against Khachanov.
“I was very effective from the start, I had a lot of pace and gained momentum,” said Tsitsipas. “I tried to do my part and press and it worked out really well.”
Tsitsipas added:  “There are many good memories here and stepping out and coming back revives those good memories. It brings me alive.”
Eighth-seeded Ruud saw off 14th seed Ugo Humbert of France 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 to make the semi-finals in Monte Carlo for the second time.

The seven-time champions took a commanding 2-0 lead into day two at Brisbane’s Pat Rafter Arena, allowing Stosur to rest Arina Rodionova and hand a debut to 18-year-old Taylah Preston.
She seized the opportunity with both hands, sweeping past the experienced Marcela Zacarias, 12 years her senior, 6-1, 6-1 to put the tie beyond Mexico’s reach.
Daria Saville and Ellen Perez rubbed salt in the wounds by beating Mexican duo Jessica Hinojosa Gomez and Maria Fernanda Navarro 6-3, 6-1 in the dead rubber doubles.
Zacarias was bidding to bank her 22nd Billie Jean King Cup match win and claim sole ownership of the record by a Mexican player.
But she was no match for the emerging teenager, who made her WTA Tour main-draw debut at the 2022 Rosmalen Grass Court Championships as a qualifier before an injury derailed her progress.
An aggressive Preston powered through the first set in 37 minutes and kept the momentum going with a break for 2-1 in the second set.
Zacarias rolled her ankle midway through the first set and there was no way back as she struggled with the injury, in tears after being beaten.
JAPAN REACH FINALS FOR FIRST TIME
Also on Saturday, Naomi Osaka was not required to play after team-mate Nao Hibino sent Japan to their first Billie Jean King Cup finals in a 3-1 qualifying win over Kazakhstan in Tokyo.
Former world number one and four-time Grand Slam winner Osaka was appearing at the competition for the first time since 2020 and won her opening singles game on Friday.
But she did not need to play a second time after Hibino clinched Japan’s spot in November’s finals in Seville with a hard-fought 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (9-7) win over world number 50 Yulia Putintseva.
Osaka, who returned to tennis late last year after giving birth, was appearing in Japan for the first time since playing at the Pan Pacific Open in September 2022.
She beat Putintseva 6-2, 7-6 (7-5) on Friday, hitting 15 aces and no double faults to stake Japan to a 2-0 lead.
Hibino said Osaka had brought presents for her Japan team-mates and had been an important presence in the dressing room.
But it was Hibino who took centre stage on the second day’s play, fending off four straight match points for Putintseva before coming back to win the third-set tiebreaker.
It was Hibino’s second singles victory of the tie after dispatching Anna Danilina 6-1, 6-0 in under an hour on the opening day.
Kazakhstan salvaged a consolation point from the doubles dead rubber when Danilina and Zhibek Kulambayeva beat Shuko Aoyama and Ena Shibahara 7-6 (9-7), 3-6, 11-9.
On Friday night, Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro both rallied for three-set wins, leading the US to a 2-0 lead over Belgium in their Billie Jean King Cup qualifier at Orlando.
Pegula defeated Sofia Costoulas 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 before Navarro topped Hanne Vandewinkel 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
The eight winning teams advance to the event’s final rounds to be held in November at Seville, Spain. They will join four teams that are already qualified: reigning champion Canada, 2023 runner-up Italy, host Spain and wild-card nation Czech Republic.
World No. 1 Iga Swiatek cruised past Switzerland’s Simona Waltert 6-3, 6-1 to help Poland establish a 2-0 lead in Biel, Switzerland.
In other action, Great Britain are level 1-1 with host France in Le Portel; Germany jumped on top of Brazil 2-0 in Sao Paulo; host Slovakia went up 2-0 on Slovenia in Bratislava; and Ukraine established a 2-0 advantage on Romania in Fernandina Beach.

He joins India’s Yuvraj Singh, who made his runs off England’s Stuart Broad in Durban in the 2007 World Cup, and West Indian slugger Kieron Pollard who hammered Sri Lanka’s Akila Dananjaya in Antigua in 2021.
South Africa’s Herschelle Gibbs and Jaskaran Malhotra of the US have achieved the feat in one-day international cricket while no one has ever done it in Test cricket.
Airee was on 28 from 15 balls, and Nepal on 174 for 7, when medium pacer Kamran Khan began the final over of the innings in the ACC Men’s Premier Cup match.
The next six deliveries were all deposited over the ropes as Airee finished on 64 not out from 21 balls.
Nepal, who will appear in their second T20 World Cup later this year in West Indies and the US, closed on 210-7 which was enough to beat Qatar by 32 runs.
It was the second time that Airee, 24, has hit six successive sixes. He achieved it against Mongolia in their Asian Games meeting in Hangzhou in September, but on that occassion the six sixes were spread across two overs.
Nepal begin their T20 World Cup agai­nst the Netherlands in Dallas on June 4. They will also play group games against South Africa, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

10,Reigning Olympic champion Rojas to miss Paris Games with injury,CARACAS: Reigning Olympic women’s triple jump champion Yulimar Rojas said on Friday she had injured her Achilles...,"CARACAS: Reigning Olympic women’s triple jump champion Yulimar Rojas said on Friday she had injured her Achilles tendon and will miss the Paris Games.
The 28-year-old Venezuelan said she had torn her Achilles during a training jump in Spain and had undergone surgery in Madrid on Thursday.
“My heart is broken and I want to say sorry that I will not be able to take part in Paris 2024,” said Rojas in a statement on her social media accounts.
In the statement, accompanied by a picture of her in a hospital bed, Rojas said that as she landed from the training jump,  “I felt an intense pain, which has been diagnosed as an injury to the left Achilles tendon”.
Rojas won the silver medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics and then took the Olympic title at the Covid-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021.
She dramatically won the fourth of her outdoor world titles in Budapest last year with her last-round leap, moving from eighth place to gold medal position with a winning jump of 15.08m.
Rojas is also the world record holder in the event with a jump of 15.74m in 2022.
She was voted the World Athlete of the Year for women’s field events last year and would have been a hot favourite to retain her Olympic title in Paris.
“Today I feel very emotionally affected about not being able to defend my Olympic title... but I must stop, take that in, recover and return with a lot of strength to continue to fly together,” Rojas said in a message to her fans.
The Paris Olympics take place from July 26 to Aug 11.
In Venezuela, Rojas is a national heroine.
Her face appears on huge frescoes, photos adorn many walls and commercials featuring the star athlete on television are a common feature.
She is the only woman and the only track and field athlete to win Olympic gold for Venezuela, which has three male champions in other sports.
Among them, Ruben Limardo, a fencing gold medallist in London in 2012, said Rojas remains an inspiration to the country ahead of the Paris Olympics.
“Yuli, every step we take, we will do so in thinking that you are with us in body, soul and heart. Warrior, you can rise and fly again,” he said.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro added:  “All my love, my solidarity, my support. We love you and we know your commitment and your discipline. You are a warrior of life, an example for young people.”
Based in Spain, Rojas emerged from the deprived neighborhoods of Puerto La Cruz, around 300km from capital city, Caracas.
“We raised Yuli in this humble universe with a lot of problems. She rose, rose, rose...”, proudly remembered her mother Yuleisi Rodriguez, interviewed by AFP before the Tokyo Games.
