TEHRAN: Iran’s Revolutionary Guards seized a container ship “related to the Zionist regime (Israel)” in the Gulf on Saturday, state media reported, with tensions soaring in the region.
The ship’s operator, the Italian-Swiss group MSC, later confirmed Iranian authorities had boarded it.
A container ship “was seized by the Sepah (Guards) Navy Special Forces by carrying out a heliborne operation,” state news agency IRNA reported, naming it as the MSC Aries.
It added that the operation took place “near the Strait of Hormuz” and “this ship has now been directed towards the territorial waters” of Iran.
MSC confirmed the Aries had “been boarded by Iranian authorities via helicopter as she passed the Strait of Hormuz” on Saturday morning.
It said that 25 crew were on board and that it was “working closely with the relevant authorities to ensure their wellbeing, and safe return of the vessel”.
The Aries is leased by international shipping line MSC from Gortal Shipping, an affiliate of Zodiac Maritime, Zodiac said in a statement, adding that MSC is responsible for all vessel activities. Zodiac is partly owned by Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer.
The Strait of Hormuz connects the Gulf with the Indian Ocean and, according to the US Energy Information Admin­istra­tion, more than a fifth of annual global oil consumption passes through it each year.
A video shared on social media appeared to show people descending from a helicopter onto the deck of the Aries using a rope.
Vessel tracking websites, vesselfinder.com and marinetraffic.com, say MSC Aries is a Portuguese-flagged container ship and gave its last reported position as in the Gulf.
The United States on Friday said it was sending military reinforcements to the region, after Iran vowed retaliation for a strike on its embassy.

Biden cuts trip short
US President Joe Biden cut short a weekend trip to Delaware on Saturday to return to Washington for urgent consultations on the Middle East, the White House said, amid heightened tensions between Iran and Israel.
“The President is returning to the White House this afternoon to consult with his national security team about events in the Middle East,” the White House said.
Israel ‘in complete panic’
An adviser to Iran’s supreme leader said that Israel is ‘panicking’ over a possible retaliatory response after the strike on its embassy.
“It has been a week that the Zionists are in complete panic and are on alert,” Yahya Rahim Safavi, senior adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted as saying by the ISNA news agency. “They don’t know what Iran wants to do, so they and their supporters are terrified,” he said.
However, Israel warned Iran would suffer the “consequences for choosing to escalate the situation”.
Another 52 killed in Gaza
The surging tensions come against the backdrop of Israel’s attacks in Gaza. In recent months, Israeli forces have killed at least 33,686 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry. The toll rose by 52 over the last 24 hours, the ministry said.

1,Iraqi PM heads to US amid rising regional tension,Will discuss with Biden the “evolution of the military mission” of the “US-led anti-jihadist coalition” in Iraq and Syria.,"BAGHDAD: Iraq’s Prime Minister Mohamed Shia Al-Sudani left Baghdad on Saturday for the United States, his office said, where he will meet with the US president as regional tensions flare.
US President Joe Biden is due to receive the Iraqi leader on Monday to “coordinate on common priorities” and discuss the “evolution of the military mission” of the “US-led anti-jihadist coalition” in Iraq and Syria, according to the White House.
The trip comes after Iran threatened to retaliate for deadly strikes, blamed on Israel, on its consulate in the Syrian capital Damascus. Biden has said he expects Tehran to take action “sooner rather than later”.
“This official visit occurs at a delicate and sensitive time in the relations with the United States, as well as in the context of regional conditions and the ongoing crimes against innocents in the Palestinian territories,” a statement from Sudani’s office said.
The surging tensions come against the backdrop of the escalation in Israeli attacks in Gaza.
The “meeting with President Biden will discuss the regional issues and the current escalations, focusing on the joint efforts to promote calm and prevent the conflict from widening, which could impact global stability,” Sudani’s office added.
In recent months, armed groups have carried out a slew of attacks on US soldiers deployed to the Middle East, in support of Palestinians. Washington has responded with several strikes on the factions. But tensions have subsided between the US and Iraq.
An aim of the talks is to establish “a timeline to end the coalition’s mission and transition to bilateral relations with the coalition member states”, Sudani’s office said.

2,Six killed in Sydney mall attack; assailant shot dead,Victims include five women; nine-month-old baby among injured,"SYDNEY: An attacker who fatally knifed six people in a Sydney mall was shot dead by police in the beachside suburb of Bondi on Saturday, police said, as hundreds fled the scene.
The assailant was shot by a police officer after he attacked shoppers in the busy Westfield Bondi Junction shopping centre, police said in a statement.
Five of the six victims killed were women, while eight people, including a nine-month-old baby, were taken to hospital with stab wounds, New South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb told a press conference. Police at this stage do not believe the attack was terrorism-related, Webb said.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there was no indication yet of the man’s motive.

Victims include five women; nine-month-old baby among injured

“This was a horrific act of violence, indiscriminately targeting innocent people going about an ordinary Saturday doing their shopping,” he told a presser.
“Tonight the first thoughts of all Australians are with the victims of these terrible acts,” he said.
Pope ‘deeply saddened’
Pope Francis was “deeply saddened” by the stabbing attack, the Vatican said Saturday.
“Pope Francis was deeply saddened to learn of the violent attack in Sydney and conveys his spiritual solidarity to all those affected by this senseless tragedy,” said Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin in a message addressed to the Archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Colin Fisher.
Australia has some of the world’s toughest gun and knife laws, and attacks such as the one on Saturday are rare. After the stabbing reports, police said, emergency services were called to the mall, about three kilometres from Sydney’s iconic Bondi Beach and popular with children and families.
Witness account
Ayush Singh, 25, was working in a cafe in the mall when he saw the attack and then heard gunshots as police responded. “I saw the guy with the knife running and chasing people. As he walked just past beside me I heard two or three gunshots and the guy was neutralised,” he said.
“People around me were terrified. There were some old ladies I helped to get them inside a safe place inside the cafe.”
Two other witnesses said they heard shots. “Even 20 minutes after people were rushed out of the mall, I saw SWAT teams of people sweeping the surrounding streets,” one witness said.
The other witness said they saw a woman lying on the ground and took shelter in a jewellery store.
An eyewitness described the policewoman shooting the attacker to state broadcaster ABC. “If she did not shoot him, he would have kept going, he was on the rampage,” said the man, who did not give his name. “She went over and was giving him CPR. He had a nice big blade on him. He looked like he was on a killing spree.”
Several posts on social media showed crowds fleeing the mall and police cars and emergency services rushing to the area.
The mall will remain closed on Sunday while an investigation got underway, police said.

3,Thousands evacuated from flood-hit Russian city,"Ural River breached its banks after water rose above ""critical"" level.","ORENBURG: Thousands of people were evacuated from the Orenburg region in the south of the Urals as floodwater continued to rise, Russian emergency services said on Saturday.
In the city of Orenburg, one of the worst-hit areas in Russia, the Ural River breached its banks, submerging streets and residential areas and water levels continued to rise. By Saturday afternoon, the river level had reached almost 12 metres (39 feet), more than 2.5 metres above the level considered ‘critical’.
The Ural River flows through the centre of Orenburg.
Fast-rising temperatures have melted snow and ice, and along with heavy rain have caused a number of major rivers that cross Russia and Kazakhstan to overflow this month.

Ural River breached its banks after water rose above ‘critical’ level

Floodwater covered the embankment promenade and swirled around houses and high-rise apartment blocks built close to the river, an AFP journalist saw.
Almost 14,000 people have been evacuated from Orenburg and the surrounding region, according to authorities.
Eldar Rakhmetov, an official from the Ministry of Emergency Situations involved in the evacuation, said: “There has been an increase in the number of homes flooded since this morning and more areas are being evacuated.” Local residents were using rubber dinghies to try to retrieve pets and belongings from flooded houses and some areas were left without power.
Valery, 64, a local factory worker, was one of those evacuated on Saturday by a police truck. “The most important thing is that (my house) does not get looted. That is what I am worried about. Other than that, it is fine! We will survive,” he said.
The Kurgan region further east was also urging people to evacuate, anticipating the arrival of floodwater.
Governor Vadim Shumkov urged residents likely to be affected to leave now as the level of the River Tobol is forecast to rise sharply due to melting ice.
“The water is treacherous and when there is so much of it, it rises unpredictably,” Shumkov warned residents on Telegram, urging them to leave with valuables and pets. “If you do not leave in time, you might not be able to sit it out in the attic or on the roof,” the governor added.
220,000 affected in Kazakhstan

In Kazakhstan, which shares around 7,500km of border with Russia, flooding affected the outskirts of the northern city of Petropavlovsk, which has around 220,000 residents, leaving some areas without power or mains water.
More than 103,000 people, many of them children, have been evacuated in the vast Central Asian country, where almost 5,000 homes have been flooded out, according to the emergency situations ministry.
Climate change is associated with more frequent extreme weather events such as floods.
In the Russian Urals city of Orsk, where a dam protecting the city broke earlier this month, residents held rare protests this week over the local authorities’ handling of the crisis.
Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting on the floods on Thursday, but has not visited the affected regions.
