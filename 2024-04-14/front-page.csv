• CM Bugti says checkpoints on highways to be revived; PM Shehbaz seeks report
QUETTA / GUJRAT: Nine people, who planned to reach Europe to live a better life, were shot dead in Balochistan in the small hours of Saturday. The gunmen abducted them from a Taftan-bound bus based on their ethnicity and dumped their bodies under a bridge in a hilly area of Noshki.
In a similar attack possibly by the same gunmen, an­other two people were killed after they attem­p­ted to escape the cordon set up by the assailants on N-40, the Quetta-Noshki Highway.
A spokesperson for the banned Balochistan Libe­r­a­tion Army claimed respo­nsibility for the killings.
 
 

According to officials, armed men blocked the highway and started intercepting the vehicles. Soon, they intercepted a passenger coach on its way to Taftan from Quetta and looted the belongings of passengers, including cash and mobile phones.
After checking the identity cards of the passengers, the gunmen separa­ted nine passengers — who had Punjab as their residential address — and took them away at gunpoint.
According to the national identity cards, the victims hailed from Wazirabad, Gujranwala, and Mandi Bahauddin.
Upon receiving the information, law enforcement agencies launched a search operation to rec­over the kidnapped passengers — most of them in their early 20s. However, they were tipped off about the presence of bullet-riddled bodies under a bridge in the hilly terrain of Noshki.
“All the nine people had received multiple bullet injuries on their bodies and were shot at a close range by the abductors,” senior police official Asad Men­gal, deployed at the Noshki police station, told Dawn.
“The victims were travelling in the passenger coach on their way to Taftan,” Habibullah Mus­a­khail, Noshki deputy com­missioner told Dawn. He added that 10 to 12 armed men blocked the highway, abducted nine people and later killed them.
About the two other deaths, the officials said the two people died in the firing in the same Sultan hilly area of Noshki.
They said a car that tried to force its way through the gunmen’s cordon was fired upon, killing one passenger and injuring four others in the car.
“When the car did not stop, the armed men opened fire at the vehicle, bursting its tyres. As a result, the car turned turtle, Mr Mengal said, adding that two local people were killed in the second attack. One of the car’s passengers was a brother of provincial assembly member Ghulam Dastagir Badini.
The bodies were shifted to Quetta and their funeral prayers were held at Police Lines.
‘Plans to enter Europe’
The nine slain men hailed from different towns of central Punjab and were on their way to Iran from where they were planning to enter Europe via Turkiye.
Sources close to their families told Dawn that the victims had been booked by a Gujranwala-based agent for travel to Iran and Iraq.
They said the victims had valid visas for Iraq and Iran — a fact confirmed by the official sources.
The young men who left their towns on April 7 with visas stamped for Iran and Iraq had no plans to stay in these countries. Locals told Dawn that their actual destination was Europe, which they wanted to reach via Turkiye.
They claimed that the victim had procured valid visas for Iraq and Iran to avoid Iranian immigration authorities.
By pretending to be pilgrims going to holy sites in the two countries, they wanted to avoid the scrutiny of the Iranian border officials who often consider young Pakistanis as illegal immigrants trying to enter Europe via Turkiye, which borders Iran.
Out of the nine victims, six hail from the same village of Chak Fateh Shah in Mandi Bahauddin. Their names were Tanzeel Nasir, 20; Muhammad Qasim, 22; Sajid Imran, 23; Abu Bakar, 23; Muzamil Hussain, 22; and Mazhar Iqbal, 21.
One victim from Chora village of Wazirabad was 17-year-old Wasiq, while Rana Shahzeb from Gujranwala and Javed Shahzed of Afzalpur were also among the slain.
Wasiq’s friends told the media that he had left the village hoping for a bright future in Europe, but lost his life instead. Sources in the families of victims said that the agent had initially received a sum of Rs260,000 per person and more had to be paid after reaching the destination in Europe.
Zahid Imran Butt, however, was the lucky one who survived. He said he survived because he was sitting with “a local family from Balochistan”. He said his nine companions — including six friends from Mandi Bahauddin — were offloaded by two armed men who had initially asked all Punjabis to get off the bus. He confirmed that he along with his friends were going abroad hoping for employment
 
 

Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujranwala, Wazirabad and Bhimbher in Azad Jammu and Kashmir are known as profitable areas for illegal human trafficking networks across the globe. Last year, scores of Pakistanis were killed on their way to Europe after their boat capsized.
Security plan
Vowing that the culprits would not go unpunished, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said the government would revive the security checkpoints on national highways to protect passengers.
 






Talking to the media after attending the funeral prayers of the nine victims, he said those involved in the horrific killing “are not Baloch but terrorists, and they should be called terrorists”.
The CM said the government would probe the Noshki incident and fix the responsibility.
CM Bugti said they would not negotiate on the killing of innocents and the government would undertake a comprehensive review of the security plan in the province.
“National highways are the most important routes, and we will protect them. We will formulate a security plan again in the province, establishing checkpoints with joint patrolling of the police, Levies, and the FC [Frontier Corps],” he said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the attack and sought a report on the incident. He extended his condolences to the victims’ families, saying: “We stand with the bereaved families in this hour of grief.”

• Tel Aviv terms attack ‘severe, dangerous escalation’; Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon close their airspace
JERUSALEM: In response to the Israeli attack on Iran’s diplomatic premises in the Syrian capital, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) in the early hours of Sunday morning launched “extensive” retaliatory drone and missile strikes — as part of what they called the Operation ‘True Promise’ — against “certain targets” inside Israel.
Israel’s military said the drones, which Iraqi security sources said were seen flying over the country from Iran, would take hours to reach their targets, after the IRGC announced the Operation ‘True Promise’ is part of “punishment for Israeli crimes”.
In a televised statement, Israel’s military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari confirmed that Iran launched UAVs from its territory towards the territory of the state of Israel. “We are closely monitoring Iranian killer drones that are en route to Israel sent by Iran. This is a severe and dangerous escalation,” Rear Admiral Hagari said.
Iran had already announced retaliation for the Israeli attack on its Damascus consulate that killed seven IRGC officers on April 1. However, US President Joe Biden had warned Iran against attacking Israel after saying such a scenario appeared imminent, pledging to stand with Israel. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said, “President Biden has been clear: our support for Israel’s security is ironclad.”
As the situation unfolds, Mr Biden is due to meet in the White House’s heavily secured situation room with his top officials including Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and CIA chief Bill Burns, the White House added.
An IRGC statement issued earlier read, “In response to the Zionist regime’s numerous crimes, including the attack on the consular section of Iran’s embassy in Damascus and the martyrdom of a number of our country’s commanders and military advisors in Syria, the IRGC’s aerospace division launched tens of missiles and drones against certain targets inside the occupied territories.”
Israel’s military said sirens would sound in any threatened areas and that its defences were poised to deal with them.
Israel, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon closed their airspace on Saturday night.
Earlier on Saturday, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported that a Guards helicopter had boarded and taken into Iranian waters an Israeli-linked vessel, with 25 crew.
Israeli attacks on Gazans in recent months have already driven up tensions in the region, spreading to fronts with Lebanon and Syria and drawing long-range fire from as far away as Yemen.

2,Two soldiers martyred in Buner operation,PESHAWAR: Two security officials were marty­red and a militants’ ringleader was killed in an exchange of fire...,"PESHAWAR: Two security officials were marty­red and a militants’ ringleader was killed in an exchange of fire between security forces and militants in the Buner district on Saturday, the military’s media wing said.
The Inter-Services Pub­lic Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that the security forces carried out an intelligence-based ope­ra­tion on the reported pre­sence of militants in the district, adding that an intense exchange of fire took place between security forces and militants during the operation.
During the crossfire, a high-value target and militant ringleader, Saleem alias Rabbani, was gun­ned down by security for­ces. Rabbani had remai­ned actively involved in numerous militant activities against the security forces as well as extortion and target killings of civilians, the ISPR said.
“He [Rabbani] was highly wanted by the law enforcement agencies and the government had fixed head money of Rs5 million on him,” it said.
Two security officials were martyred during the operation identified as Lance Havildar Mudassar Mehmood, 36, from Rawalpindi district, and Lance Naik Haseeb Javed, 27, from Azad Kashmir’s Poonch district.
“Sanitisation operation is being carried out to eli­m­inate any other terrorists found in the area,” the ISPR said, adding that “sec­urity forces of Pak­istan remain determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve”.
On March 20, two militants were killed in a gun battle between security forces and militants in the North Waziristan district.
The ISPR said the militants were killed during an operation in the area where an intense exchange of fire took place between security forces and militants.

3,SBP repays $1bn against euro bonds,"With the outflow of $1bn, the bank’s reserves will fall again close to $7bn.","KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has repaid $1 billion against euro bonds, creating goodwill for the bonds in the near future.
Pakistan on Friday successfully made a payment of $1bn on an internatio­nal bond, which included principal plus interest, the central bank said in a statement on Saturday.
“The payment was made to the agent bank for onward distribution to the bond holders,” it added.
Pakistan’s USD-denom­inated bonds rallied by 84 per cent in 2024.
The central bank has be­en struggling hard to ma­n­age reasonable fore­ign exchange reserves to satisfy the donor agency, the International Mone­tary Fund (IMF), and to keep the exchange rate stable.
With the outflow of $1bn, the bank’s reserves will fall again close to $7bn. Currently, the SBP’s reserves are around $8bn.
Pakistan is willing to negotiate for another $6bn or $8bn loan package from the IMF. The donor agency has suggested a number of reforms for generating higher revenues, low fiscal deficit, and reduced current account deficit.
The government is willing to implement the reforms, but the outcome is highly critical for the general public and the trade and industry.
As per reforms, the government is increasing oil prices, while the increase in gas prices is at a record high.
The political government is taking risks as the unpopular decisions may erase its acceptability among the masses.

Meanwhile, Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz, while talking to the media, said the combination of sea breezes with cold winds had increased the chances of tornadoes and lightning.
Balochistan
In Balochistan, the death toll from lightning and rain-related incidents rose to eight after five more people were killed in Chaman and Dera Bugti areas on Saturday.
Officials said three people were killed when lightning struck a village in Chaman. “Lightning hit a house in Chaman where three people lost their lives as the area received heavy rain with thunderstorms. Many mud houses were damaged or collapsed due to flash floods coming from the mountains after the heavy rain.
The locals shifted the bodies to a nearby hospital where doctors confirmed their death,“ they added.
Two other people were killed by lightning in the Loop area of Dera Bugti.
According to reports, Dera Bugti and Kohlu also received heavy rain that caused a flood-like situation in many areas. Several mud houses were damaged while seasonal streams and rivers were carrying heavy floodwater and around 25 districts of Balochistan were affected by torrential rains with thunderstorms.
Continued downpour caused urban flooding in Quetta and water entered many houses in low-lying areas on the outskirts of the provincial capital, forcing the residents to move to safer places.
District officials have advised people to avoid unnecessary journeys as landslides are expected due to heavy rain, especially on Zhob-Dera Ismail Khan Highway and Bolan Pass.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
In KP, two persons were killed and 10 others injured in rain-related incidents in Lower and Upper Chitral districts as heavy rain continued to lash large parts of the province on Saturday.
