0,"Nine months on, post of FPSC chairman remains vacant",Promotion of senior bureaucrats on hold as CSB meeting cannot be held,"ISLAMABAD: The promotion process of senior bureaucrats is still not in sight as the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) chairman is yet to be appointed.
The post has been lying vacant since August last year, and under the Civil Servants Act, the Central Selection Board (CSB) that takes up promotion cases of senior bureaucrats has to be headed by a regular FPSC chairman. The federal government convenes a meeting of the CSB twice a year to consider promotion of civil servants from BS-19 to BS-21.
The Cabinet Division on July 28, 2023 convened the CSB meeting to consider the promotion of officers belonging to Pakistan Administrative Service, Police Service of Pakistan, Foreign Service of Pakistan, Information Group, Inland Revenue Service, Pakistan Custom Group, Pakistan Railways, Commerce and Trade Group, Postal Services, Secretariat Group, Economist Group, Military Land and Cantonment Group and ex-cadres.
Section 9, of the Civil Servants Act 1973, deals with the promotions of the civil bureaucracy while subsection (A) of this section states that “civil servant possessing such minimum qualifications as may be prescribed shall be eligible for promotion to a higher post for the time being reserved under the rules for departmental promotion in the service or cadre to which he belongs.”

Promotion of senior bureaucrats on hold as CSB meeting cannot be held

Clause 3 of subsection 2 of this section, however, states: “Promotion to posts in basic payscales 20 and 21 and equivalent shall be made on the recommendations of a selection board which shall be headed by the chairman, Federal Public Service Commission.”
According to this section, the CSB cannot be headed by a member holding temporary charge of the FPSC.
The Federal Public Service Commission Ordinance explains that the chairman and members of the commission are to be appointed by the president.
During the previous CSB meeting, the Establishment Division had introduced a new mechanism of filtering eligibility and as a result, cases of scores of civil servants were deferred for non-submission of asset declaration.
The bureaucrats agitated for depriving them promotion and some of them also went into litigation. However, they were expecting formation of a new government in October or November last year, but the delay in holding of general elections further postponed their promotion.
The bureaucracy was expecting that the new government would convene the CSB meeting, but it did not.
The CSB meeting is not likely to be held in the near future as the post of FPSC chairman has been lying vacant for the last nine months and the Civil Servants Act had made it mandatory that the promotion board must be headed by the FPSC chairman.
When contacted, a senior official of the Cabinet Division said after the death of the commission’s chairman, Maroof Afzal, the previous coalition government appointed Shahid Ashraf Tarar in his place a few weeks before the CSB meeting. Mr Tarar was then inducted as minister in the caretaker setup and since August, the post is lying vacant, he added.
The senior official said the incumbent government would first have to appoint members of the FPSC and then elevate one of them as chairman.
“The CSB meeting can only be convened after this process and other formalities are completed, he added.

8,Raising awareness to combat cervical cancer,"According to the World Bank, Pakistan has a population of 230 million, with women constituting 50pc of the...","According to the World Bank, Pakistan has a population of 230 million, with women constituting 50pc of the population.
Over the years, there has been a rise in cancer among women, with breast and cervical cancer the most common.
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in Pakistan, affecting one out of every nine women, while cervical cancer is the third most common cancer among women in Pakistan, and the second most common among those aged 15 to 44. Both these cancers can be prevented and treated if detected early.
Cervical HPV-16/18 infection affects approximately 0.5pc of the women and accounts for 88.1pc of invasive cervical cancer cases. 
According to the worldwide cervical cancer prevention strategy, the best way to avoid cervical cancer is to get screened and vaccinated. 
Cervical cancer develops in a woman’s cervix, which is the entrance to the uterus from the vagina. Almost all (99pc) cervical cancer cases are linked to infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) – an extremely common virus transmitted through sexual contact. 
The signs and symptoms of cervical cancer are irregular or postmenopausal bleeding, increased vaginal discharge, with more severe symptoms arising at the advanced stage. 
This is the first cancer for which there is a vaccine. HPV is a non-enveloped DNA virus from the Papillomaviridae family, with over a hundred distinct serotypes. 
Of these, 15 to 20 are oncogenic, with 16 and 18 being the most prevalent. 
HPV is transmitted through sexual activity, and it is estimated that 75pc of all sexually active people have at least one HPV serotype. However, the majority of these infections resolve spontaneously, with less than 1pc developing to malignancy. 
Regular pap smear screenings can help slow this progression. Cervical cancer mortality has decreased significantly in developed countries following the introduction of pap screenings. 
Unfortunately, in underdeveloped countries such as Pakistan, pap smear uptake is quite low, with one estimate putting it as low as 2pc. In such instances, where pap smears are already difficult to perform and uptake is poor, HPV vaccinations become even more important for cervical cancer prevention. 
Two globally licensed HPV vaccinations have been introduced in Pakistan: the quadrivalent Gardasil and the bivalent Cervarix. Gardasil protects against HPV serotypes 6, 11, 16 and 18, preventing cervical cancer and genital warts. 
Cervarix, on the other hand, is exclusively effective against serotypes 16 and 18, limiting its protection to cervical cancer. It is important to remember that both of these vaccines are preventive and have no effect on pre-existing illnesses. 
There are some challenges that need to be addressed which include limited awareness especially in rural areas, inadequate access to healthcare facilities, particularly in remote regions, screening limitation, insufficient financial resources, weak health system, cancer registries, limited number of trained providers and no national guidelines/ protocols for treatment of cervical cancer. 
Despite their introduction in Pakistan, there is a lack of awareness about these vaccinations and limited adoption in public. It was reported that HPV vaccine awareness is as low as 20pc and uptake to be less than 10pc. 
Cervical cancers affect over 6,000 women in Pakistan each year, with approximately 3,000 dying from the disease. So we are looking into 3,000 deaths each year, which may seem insignificant when you consider the population of 230 million. 
Let’s not forget, there are preventive measures available, including vaccination. Pakistan does not have a national HPV vaccination programme, does not manufacture vaccines and does not have government-backed programmes to subsidise the available HPV vaccines. 
Furthermore, despite their launch three to four years ago, Cervarix and Gardasil are still difficult to obtain in most regions of the country. Another challenge to HPV vaccination is a lack of awareness and education on the subject. 
This stems from cultural taboos around discussions about sexual health, practices, and diseases. 
Therefore, careful measures should be taken to increase public awareness of cervical cancer and HPV vaccination. 
The government should conduct nationwide awareness programmes to educate the public about cervical cancer and how to prevent it. This should be aimed at parents, carers, local stakeholders, religious leaders and civil society members. 
The ministry has both an Ulema forum and a media forum. 
We can also take them onboard by explaining that if we do these things, it will help our country and the 50pc female population.
According to the country’s report, we have only four radiotherapy centres, and only one brachy therapy centre, which is an ideal treatment for cervical cancer. We do not have any national recommendations or protocols for the treatment of cervical cancer. 
Cancer registry is also highly significant, however, it is still not available in Pakistan despite all efforts. 
There should be reference channels and standard operating procedures in place to reduce system delays. We lack capacity building; we do not have skilled healthcare providers or lady health workers to advise someone through any challenge. 
Therefore there is a need to introduce capacity-building programmes to impart training on the subject. There are also different international organisations like JICA that want to help Pakistan. Besides, every private hospital has its own specific policy, and these policies are not monitored centrally by the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) or any other institution that holds them accountable. 
Considering the cultural stigma surrounding this topic, it may be more useful to present the vaccination as a preventative measure for cervical cancer rather than sexual disease transmission. 
This technique is critical because immunisation is recommended for young females.
Parents of these girls should be counselled and educated on the necessity of administering this vaccine early. 
Since the recommended age for HPV vaccine administration is nine to 26 years, and it is preferable to provide it as early as possible with two doses, these national efforts should include school settings. 
There is also a need to address the shortage of HPV vaccines by making them accessible and inexpensive. 
HPV vaccinations can be integrated into the Expanded Programme of Immunisation, which operates at the district level in partnership with civil society organisations. To reduce burden, we need to create awareness and reach out to rural and marginalised communities.— The writer is a nutritionist

10,"Wasa seeks Rs150m to dredge Leh, 11 other drains in Rawalpindi",Spokesperson says work likely to start by end of April,"RAWALPINDI: The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) has requested the Punjab government to release Rs150 million for the cleanliness of Leh Nullah and 11 major drains in the garrison city ahead of the monsoon season (July to September).
After the provincial government sought the estimate for the cleanliness of the drains and Leh Nullah from Wasa, the sanitation agency demanded Rs70 million for the 11 big drains and Rs80 million for the cleanliness of Leh Nullah.
Since 2009, the desilting of Leh Nullah at vulnerable points has been carried out by Wasa with the assistance of the Punjab government either through the Annual Development Programme (ADP) or supplementary grants, said a senior Wasa official.
However, Wasa has never maintained tributaries of Leh Nullah in Rawalpindi city since its establishment in 1998. These drains were previously maintained and desilted by the municipal services wing of the city district government, Rawalpindi.

Spokesperson says work likely to start by end of April

After its devolution, the Rawalpindi Waste Management Company (RWMC) has been maintaining all drains, including the tributaries of Leh Nullah since 2015.
Last year, Wasa was asked to desilt other drains along with Leh on an immediate basis and the local government and the community development department asked Wasa Rawalpindi to take up the task to dredge the nullah.
Wasa has also been asked by the Punjab government to carry out a detailed physical survey for desilting of all nullahs/stormwater drains ahead of the monsoon season. Its estimated cost is Rs70 million.
When contacted, Wasa spokesman Umer Farooq said the agency had sought funds from the provincial government and that work would be started as soon as the funds were transferred. 
The spokesperson said the dredging of Leh and other streams would likely start by the end of April and it would be finished by June-end.
Wasa has prepared its plan for the cleanliness of Leh and other drains and identified all hurdles in the smooth flow of rainwater in nullahs. He said the provincial government wanted to prepare the plan ahead of monsoon season to avoid a flood-like situation.
Rawalpindi’s topography
According to the senior Wasa official, Rawalpindi has a favourable topography for stormwater drainage.
“It has several stormwater channels/nullahs passing through the city. Leh Nullah is the main nullah which enters Rawalpindi from the northern side of the city (Khayaban-i-Sir Syed), and flows through the densely populated areas of the city,” he said.
According to the official, Leh has a catchment area of 239.8km and has six major tributaries: three streams originate from the foothills of Islamabad and flow through Rawalpindi where other tributaries join it.
Floods in the Leh Nullah Basin normally occur during the monsoon season when Islamabad receives rainfall from three types of weather systems, namely monsoon depressions from the Bay of Bengal, India (the most important system), westerly waves from the Mediterranean Sea, and seasonal lows from the Arabian Sea.

Water also accumulated on roads contrary to claims by Rawalpindi Cantonment Board and Chaklala Cantonment Board that they had improved the drainage system.
The Met Office forecast more rain and cool winds sweeping northern parts of Pakistan in the next 24 hours. “A strong westerly wave is affecting most parts of the country. Moisture from Arabian Sea also penetrating into southern parts of the country,” a meteorological department official said.
He said more rain-wind/thunderstorm was likely in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Islamabad, Punjab, Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and upper Sindh. Heavy fall/hailstorm is also likely at isolated places in upper KP, Kashmir, upper Balochistan and upper Punjab. Snowfall is expected on mountains in northern areas.
He said heavy rains may generate flash floods in nullas of Dera Ghazi Khan, Koh-i-Suleman, Khuzdar, Ziarat, Zhob, Sherani, Muslim Bagh, Quetta, Pishin, Kech, Panjgur, Gwadar and Turbat till Sunday. Flooding may also occur in low lying areas during the forecast period.
Heavy rainfall may generate flash flooding in nullahs/streams of Dir, Swat, Chitral, Kohistan, Mansehra, tributaries of Kabul River, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir till Monday. Landslides in upper KP, Murree, Galiyat, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan may affect vulnerable locations.

The decision to this effect was taken during a meeting - which took stock of law and order in Punjab - chaired by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in Murree, says a press release issued by the Directorate of Public Relations.
The statement said that a ‘grand package’ had been formulated to make the province free from crime and corruption.
The meeting also decided that the crimes involving sexual assaults on children and women would be made non-bailable offence and a law to this effect would soon be formulated.
It was also decided to completely overhaul the prosecution department of Punjab and introduce special courts for speedy trials.
“An approval was granted to carry out a campaign for the complete eradication of narcotics from the province,” the statement said, adding that action would also be taken against “organised and cybercrimes” in the province.
“An approval was also accorded to enforce a special audit system in order to ascertain corruption and unprofessional attitude in police,” the statement said, adding that the police officers and officials having ties with corrupt mafias would be held accountable.
“In case of asking for a bribe, a complaint can be registered via CM’s special dashboard,” the statement added.
The CM directed the provincial administration and Punjab police to improve the law and order situation in the province and control the saturation of illegal weapons to make the province secure. 
The meeting also decided to take steps to put an end to illegal weapons in the province and banned the issuance of new weapons licences.
It also decided to step up the crackdown on power theft and smuggling in the province. 
In order to put an end to smuggling, a proposal for the establishment of a ‘border force’ was also floated.
During the meeting, Maryam Nawaz said there would be zero tolerance for rape cases against women and children. 
She also urged the police to use modern technology to improve policing and the quality of prosecution.
She said that the only way to combat crimes was to improve the prosecution and added that a dedicated force would be formed for all types of crimes.
The meeting also decided to put an end to criminal gangs in the province through “effective crackdown for the permanent eradication of terrorism, smuggling and criminal gangs”. 
The CM also directed the officials concerned for additional foolproof measures to eliminate kite-flying.
