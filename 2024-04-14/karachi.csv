1,Major action planned in Karachi against buyers of snatched cell phones,"Organised gangs of repeat offenders are behind violent street crime, claims DIG Baloch; says ""drug den operators"" purchase phones from addicts.","• Organised gangs of repeat offenders are behind violent street crime, claims DIG Baloch
• Says ‘drug den operators’ purchase snatched cell phones from addicts
• List being prepared of junk dealers purchasing parts of stolen vehicles
KARACHI: Police on Saturday announced that they would launch a ‘massive’ action against illegal markets and those shops involved in sale and purchase of snatched cell phones and stolen parts of cars and motorcycles in the city.
Speaking at a press conference at his office, DIG-West Irfan Ali Baloch said police were ‘dismantling’ drug dens which were selling narcotics to ‘drug addict robbers’ in return of snatched cell phones.
He said citizens were being gunned down during snatching of mobile phones, and therefore, the police had decided to take action against the markets and shopkeepers who were selling the snatched cell phones after changing their International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers.
 
 

However, he admitted that certain robbers had also developed the capacity to change IMEI of snatched phones as such ‘software’ had been developed for this purpose.
He said over the past 11 days eight suspected robbers were shot dead while 42 others were arrested with bullet wounds.
Quoting CPLC data, the DIG said street crimes in West Zone had come down 50pc after these police actions.
Organised gangs of robbers
He said in 2023, around 100 people were shot dead by robbers in the city. He admitted that in the ongoing year, there was an upsurge particularly in violent street crimes.
“There may be many reasons behind it but in my opinion, the main reason is emergence/establishment of organised gangs,” said the DIG.
He said they were investigating every held suspect and it transpired that the robbers had established gangs and networks to commit street crimes.
Mostly, repeat offenders were involved in robbery-cum-murder and robbery-cum-injury incidents because they had been arrested and sent to prison several times and come out as ‘hardened criminals’ who did not hesitate to kill anyone over slightest of resistance.
Easy availability of arms was also a ‘dangerous’ thing and the police were ascertaining as to from where the robbers were getting small arms, he said.
The officer added that they were also preparing a list of junk dealers who purchased parts of stolen vehicles and the police would deal with them ‘harshly’.
The DIG said they had reports that drug den operators were involved in purchase of snatched cell phones, thus a ‘massive action’ would soon be launched to dismantle such narcotic dens.
15 citizens killed by mobile phone snatchers in West Zone
The DIG said that since Jan 1, a total of 15 citizens had been shot dead during snatching of cell phones by robbers in West Zone and 60 per cent of these cases had been ‘solved’.
He said since 23rd of March, five citizens were shot dead by robbers and all these cases had been ‘traced’.
The DIG said in an ‘encounter’ a suspect, Farhan Umerzada, was arrested with bullet wounds at the Irani Camp of Orangi Town.
During interrogation, he revealed that he was involved in crimes since 2022 and had committed around 200/250 robberies.
His accomplices Adnan and Farhan used to change IMEI of snatched cell phones and then sold them, the officer added.
On the second day of Eidul Fitr, the held suspect along with his accomplice had shot a woman for resisting a robbery bid in Mominabad.
“This gang is comprised of five members. The suspect Farhan is a habitual criminal who has been arrested and sent to prison.”
He said Samanabad police with the help of technology had arrested three members of ‘Tunda gang’ involved in robberies.
The held suspects told the police that they had developed friendship in jail and formed a gang.
One suspect Waqas was involved in eight robberies in different parts of the metropolis including Clifton, Boat Basin while another held suspect Khushal was also a habitual criminal.
He said that West police also arrested two members of ‘Raja gang’ in Surjani Town who had committed at least seven robberies in the area recently.
They were also habitual criminals who had been arrested before and sent to prison in five cases in recent past.

3,PTI seeks top judge’s intervention to curb street crime in city,"Haleem Adil visits residences of Major Saad, Turab Zaidi who were killed by robbers in separate incidents","KARACHI: The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf on Saturday called upon the chief justice of Pakistan to take notice of growing lawlessness in Karachi and intervene to curb increasing street crime in the metropolis.
The party also termed the Pakistan Peoples Party government in Sindh a “failed system of governance”, which had remained unable to curb the runaway crimes in the province.
PTI-Sindh president Haleem Adil Sheikh also questioned the role of the police in the province, saying they promptly took action against those raising voice for justice but completely failed to challenge armed gangs of criminals in the metropolis.
“What would you call a government which even fails to provide security to its people on festivals like Eid,” he said while talking to reporters in Gulshan-i-Iqbal, where he visited to offer his condolences to the family of slain call centre employee Turab Zaidi who was shot dead by robbers a day ago.
“It’s not the time of lip services and hollow claims. The government must move now to address the deteriorating law and order situation in the city. So far, the government has failed to apprehend the perpetrators of these crimes which have left Karachi residents feeling insecure in their own city,” he said.
He sought intervention of the chief justice of Pakistan in controlling street crimes in the city. “We urge the chief justice to intervene and address the growing lawlessness in Karachi. Justice must prevail,” he said.
He called upon the government to prioritise the safety and security of citizens and to ensure that those responsible for such heinous acts were brought to justice. 
He also emphasised the importance of providing immediate financial assistance to the orphaned children left behind by the victims.
A statement later issued by the party said that the PTI-Sindh president also visited the residence of Major Saad Sheikh, who was shot at and wounded in a robbery incident on March 31 and breathed his last earlier this week in a hospital.
He expressed his condolences to both the families and gathered details of the incidents.
Reiterating the party’s “fight against corruption and electoral fraud”, Mr Sheikh called on the people to join the PTI’s “struggle” in demanding accountability from politicians who had betrayed their trust.
He reaffirmed PTI’s commitment to standing by the people of Karachi in their quest for justice and security.

5,A musicologist discovers four ‘songbirds’,S.M. Shahid believes childhood is the right age to learn music,"KARACHI: Every Saturday and Sunday, all the sweet chirping of birds in S.M. Shahid’s house doesn’t just have the trees in his lawn as its source. It is more than chirping actually. It is a choir, complete with a beat, rhythm and chorus which also adds an atmosphere of joy to the morning air. The cat licking its fat tummy as it leaned its back against a wall in the side alley of the house yawns as it lazily glances upwards to the first floor windows before going back to its dry-cleaning regimen.  
From the kitchen downstairs, there is a refreshing fragrant aroma of brewing tea to wake up the other senses besides the ears which are at work already. You follow the sound of music to find yourself face to face with the musicologist, writer and advertising mogul, his harmonium, bookshelves and at least four children, one of whom is happily perched on his lap. They are all singing. It is a sight to behold.  
Looking up, S.M. Shahid smiles and stops playing the harmonium. He introduces the children. They are three siblings, seven-year-old Kirpa Dhanja, six-year-old Somil Dhanja and three-year-old Jessica Dhanja and seven-year-old Eden Samuel. While introducing the kids, he turns to the siblings’ father Jatinder Dhanja, who is also there, to inform him that he better change his little boy’s name. “Rename him Marcos. I can never remember his name,” he says.  
And why ‘Marcos’, one may ask. “It’s the name of a raga,” S.M. Shahid explains, as the children giggle. The children’s fathers laugh, too. They were the actual students.  

S.M. Shahid believes childhood is the right age to learn music

“In my capacity as an adviser at the National Academy of Performing Arts [NAPA], teaching music was not really part of my job description. Still, it is something which gives me satisfaction. I have written many books on music and art but that this is practical teaching,” says S.M. Shahid. “So besides my other work, I also decided to offer music classes at home for anyone at Napa who might be interested. Then one of my students, Jatinder, who was studying at Napa and coming here for extra classes with me, informed me that when he practiced at home his children Kirpa and Somil, joined him. He said they had a good ear and were very interested in music. I asked to meet them, which resulted in my taking them on as students also. Then after some four months of teaching them, I got to know, from their father again, that when the three of them practiced their singing at home, the youngest in the family, the toddler Jessica, would also join them. That brought her to my class also. And it turns out that she is the most talented in the lot. She is only three and has received only three months of training but you should hear her sing.” 
“Will you sing, Jessica? Come show us what you can do,” he asks the little girl. Her father lifts her off from the teacher’s lap and has her seated comfortably on a chair facing him. We are all set. S.M. Shahid starts playing a tune on his harmonium. Yousuf Bashir on the table also joins in before the toddler breaks into song. She sings Fayaz Hashmi’s ghazal ‘Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo’, sung originally by Farida Khanum. It is amazing to watch how the child takes care to sing each and every note with perfection. For a second, if you close your eyes to enjoy the music and take in the song, you can forget who is doing the singing ... until you open your eyes again to find the little girl there.  
After that initial very pleasant surprise, you find yourself a little more ready to listen Jessica’s older sister, seven-year-old Kirpa, who sang Lata Mangeshkar’s ‘Dekho Ji Mera Jiya Churaye Liye Jaaye’. Then it was seven-year-old Eden Samuel’s turn to sing another golden oldie from the 1940s ‘Unka Ishara Jaan Se Pyara’ sung originally by Naseem Akhtar and later re-sung by many notable singers including Nayyar Noor.  
Later, all the children and S.M. Shahid presented in the chorus ‘Binti Karo Haare Jaoon Sajan’, which also sounded really ancient.  
“I have taught many bandish or compositions to these children. In a way, considering their ages, I’m teaching them backwards,” says S.M. Shahid. “To understand the ragas they still need time and practice and more lessons. So I start with light songs to then get to dissecting the songs to get into their basics,” he explains.  
“Childhood is the right age to learn music. In next door India, all the big singers were trained at a very young age. Music requires much practice and dedication, there is a need to continue practicing for a while until you can reach somewhere,” the teacher points out.  
“I’m not charging any of these children or their fathers anything for these music classes. I want to have a junior school for such kids at Napa. Their number is gradually growing through word of mouth. They come here on Saturdays and Sundays but now I’m thinking of breaking these classes into smaller groups in order to give the children individual attention,” he says.

6,Probe finds Mercedes driver involved in fatal DHA shooting,DIG says investigators were looking into background of wounded victim who had been ‘detained’ earlier,"KARACHI: Police on Saturday collected CCTV footage and launched investigation into an incident of firing in which a motorcyclist was killed and his companion wounded by some people travelling in a Mercedes car in the Defence Housing Authority on Friday evening.
The Sahil police said Umer Mudeer was gunned down and Mohammed Imran was critically wounded when they were heading somewhere on a motorbike and some people travelling in a car opened fire on them.
Investigators had obtained CCTV footage of the spot, which showed that suspects in a Mercedes car carried out the firing.
“The footage showed a Mercedes driver, who was either paranoid or in road rage, taking a potshot at bike-riders,” said DIG-South Syed Asad Raza. 

DIG says investigators were looking into background of wounded victim who had been ‘detained’ earlier

He added that there was no evidence that the incident was linked with a robbery bid.
He pointed out that the front bumper of the Mercedes was also broken, adding that there were a significant number of bike-riders passing through the area near Shaheen-Ittehad Signal in Phase-VIII. 
CCTV footage showed a number of vehicles, particularly motorcyclists, on the road at the time of the incident.
The DIG said the deceased, who suffered two bullet wounds in the chest and back, and wounded belonged to Punjab and were currently residing in PIB Colony. Their families did not want any legal proceedings, he added.
Wounded Imran had gained consciousness at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and the police had recorded his statement. 
There were ‘some contradictions’ in his initial statement before the police about the incident, the DIG said, adding that his background and criminal record were also being checked.
Imran had been ‘detained’ by different police stations. He was living with his uncle, Haq Nawaz, in Karachi who had been arrested in different cases, including robberies and stealing. However, DIG Raza said they were investigating the case and collecting CCTVs to ascertain the identity of the suspects who opened fire on them.

7,Man gets life term for cousin’s murder,Convict killed the husband of a woman who rejected his marriage proposal in 2020,"KARACHI: A sessions court has sentenced a man to life imprisonment on charges of murdering the husband of a woman who had rejected his matrimonial proposal.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (West) Sohail Ahmed Mashori found Ahmed Khan guilty of killing his cousin Fayaz, who had been chosen over the accused by the woman.
The court also imposed a fine of Rs500,000 on the convict and in case of default he would have to suffer an additional six-month imprisonment.
In the verdict, the judge explained that he did not award capital punishment in view of the young age and lack of prior criminal record of the accused.

Convict killed the husband of a woman who rejected his marriage proposal in 2020

The court acquitted co-accused Muhammad Siddique and Suleman for lack of evidence.
Talking about the motive, the judge explained in the verdict that Ahmed had proposed to a girl, but she declined his marriage proposal. Subsequently, she accepted the proposal of victim Fayaz, who is accused’s cousin, and they tied the knot in May 2020, two months before the murder, he stated.
According to the prosecution, complainant Ameen Khan, the father of the victim, informed the police that he lived in a village in district Bunair and in July 2020, his son had gone to visit his uncle in Karachi, where he was murdered by accused Ahmed and other co-accused.
During the trial, the prosecution presented 14 witnesses to support its case against the accused. The state prosecutor, Muhammad Ashraf, argued that sufficient incriminating evidence had been presented to connect the accused to the crime.
The prosecutor submitted that witness testimonies, medical evidence and other relevant documents supported the case of the prosecution.
On the other hand, the defence argued that the prosecution had failed to prove the motive behind the crime. The defence counsel asked the court to acquit his client.

Advocate Zahooruddin Mehsud had submitted the application under Sections 22-A and 22-B of the criminal procedure code (CrPC), seeking instructions for the respondents, SSP-South and SHO of the Preedy police station, to initiate a case against Rana Sana for allegedly “expressing an intention to murder former prime minister Imran Khan”.
After considering the arguments presented, the additional district and sessions judge (South) dismissed the the application. The grounds for dismissal included the assertion that the alleged incident did not occur in the jurisdiction of that court. Furthermore, it was noted that the applicant lacked a direct relationship with the affected person.
During the proceedings, the SHO of the Preedy police station submitted a report before the court, alleging that they had requested the applicant to visit the station to record his statement. However, according to the report, the applicant failed to comply with the request and did not approach the police station.
The applicant submitted before the court that they had viewed a video circulating on social media wherein the former minister expressed an intention to harm their leader. 
They submitted that Rana Sana had strong connections with jail authorities, leading to serious concerns regarding the health of the party founder who was currently detained in Adiyala Jail in Rawalpindi.
The applicant pleaded to the court to “initiate legal proceedings against the nominated person, as the respondent had deliberately failed to take the necessary legal action against the proposed accused”.

14,Contractors use parks for commercial ventures without permission,HMC had stopped issuance of such NOCs,"HYDERABAD: Once again, the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC) has allowed commercial activity on a public park in violation of the decisions taken and directives issued in recent past. 
The corporation has lately removed director of parks for issuing such a permission, exercising his authority, bypassing the Hyderabad mayor and municipal commissioner. 
However, commercial activity has not stopped and the contractor concerned continues to use the space by operating swings, fun land, food courts, gaming machines etc in the park. 
The fresh permission was issued to a contractor from Karachi for using the Shaheed-i-Millat Park, off Autobhan Road. 

HMC had stopped issuance of such NOCs

Not only the commercial activity has been going on for several days, but also a portion of the newly-built Autobhan Road was damaged to create an ‘unauthorised parking space’ along it by erecting bamboos and placing barbed wires.
A parking fee of Rs50 per motorbike is charged from visitors. 
All this has been going on under the nose of the district administration and HMC authorities. No one know as to who has allowed the contractor to damage the road and use the park spaces. Autobhan Road is the busiest artery of Hyderabad city.
“This came to our knowledge lately”, said Municipal Commissioner Zahoor Lakhan while talking to Dawn. But, he said, the director of parks, Shiraz Leghari, has been removed from his post. “Since he is an officer from Sindh Unified Grade (SUG), his explanation and suspension order will be issued by the authority concerned,” he said. He said that the official in charge of the park, Yasir, has been suspended.
Another No-objective certificate (NOC) for Nursery Park Unit No. 6, Latifabad, which was issued again but not disclosed. However, this NOC was withdrawn following objections raised by some residents of the area. A similar permission issued for the Baby Afza Park, near Board Office, was also issued but had to be withdrawn.
Mr Lakhan confirmed that these two permission had been withdrawn. He, however, conveniently parried a question as to how matter came to his and mayor’s knowledge that belatedly when permission for other spot was withdrawn. The issuance of permission for Shaheed-i-Millat Park had been doing the round even during Ramazan.
The then HMC municipal commissioner Fakhir Shakir, had issued a directive on May 2, 2023, stating that “no any commercial activity is allowed on any park / playground / garden of Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Hyderabad till further orders. This issue is in the best interest of Hyderabad Municipal Corporation.”
But this very directive was overlooked by HMC’s officer while issuing permissions for public spaces.

Speaking to local reporters in the emergency ward of Digri Taluka Hospital, where he was first taken for treatment, Kolhi claimed that he had gone to look after his piece of agricultural land near the shrine in Deh 172, Anwer Nohani village, when his opponents in the land dispute tried to burn him to death.

Mr Soomro told media persons in Jacobabad on Saturday after offering condolences to the bereaved family of a party leader that Sindh government had turned the entire province into a no-go area.
He said that Pakistan Peoples Party had obtained votes in riverine areas where bandits ruled and now elected PPP representatives sitting in assemblies were patronising the dacoits and outlaws.
He said that Priya Kumari had been in captivity for about 31 months and Sanaullah Soomro, resident of Shikarpur, had also been in bandits’ clutches. Since the people sitting in the assembly were themselves patrons of the bandits no son of MNA or MPA had been kidnapped by dacoits, he alleged.
He said that dacoits in riverine areas were ruling highways and roads while dacoits in Pucca areas were ruling the universities, schools, hospitals and other institutions in the provinces.
He said that the Election Commission of Pakistan had helped form governments through backdoor and they would stage a demonstration against these governments in Karachi on May 2.
He said that election commissioners in Islamabad and Karachi were not ready to listen to JUI-F candidates’ complaints against rigging in elections.
He said that they would launch a movement against their stolen mandate in Larkana, Sukkur, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Kandhkot, Panu Aqil, Jacobabad and other areas. “Our workers will take to the streets now,” he said.
He said that they welcomed the launch of movement against government in Pishin and said that they were not part of the movement as they had differences with Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf on some issues. The JUI-F candidates were defeated by massive rigging in Larkana and Sukkur, he said.
Mr Soomro said in response to a question that PPP and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz could never dare throw JUI-F like tissue paper.
He said that Muslim umma had turned deaf and dumb for Palestinians. Human rights organisations were also afraid of the US and Israel, he said.
JUI district emir Dr A.G. Ansari, Shafiq Khan Khoso, Shah Zain Bijarani, Maulana Abdul Basit Shah and others were present on the occasion.

The campaign has been launched on a directive from Sindh Information Minister, Sharjeel Inam Memon, who also holds the portfolio of Excise & Taxation.
According to a police spokesman, a drug dealer, Salman Pathan, was killed in an encounter that took place in the early hours of Saturday in the Badin Chali area falling within the jurisdiction of Tando Yousuf police station. 
The spokesman said the “notorious peddler” was wanted by police in 17 different criminal cases. 
The police claimed to have recovered one kilogram of crystal ice and a weapon from the dead suspect, who hailed from Swat. His body was shifted to the Liaquat University Hospital (LUH) for a postmortem examination.
A similar ‘encounter’ was reported from the American Quarters area within the jurisdiction of the Hali Road police station. 
According to the police, suspect Iqbal Shah was shot dead during an exchange of fire late Friday night. They said a sizeable quantity of crystal ice and charas along with a weapon was seized from the suspect. 
Minister’s directive
Excise Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon had chaired a meeting of senior police officers a couple of days back to share with them his concern over the flourishing trade of narcotics in Hyderabad and smuggling of crystal ice and other deadly drugs into Sindh. 
He directed DIG Tariq Razzaq Dharejo to ensure effective measures to curb the trade.
The minister also expressed his concern over increasing tendency of using crystal ice among youth. 
He said ads should be placed in the media mentioning helpline numbers for information sharing about smuggling of narcotics. 
The minister also asked the excise secretary to form a task force comprising officers of impeccable integrity in this regard.
Hyderabad SSP Amjad Shaikh told Dawn on Saturday that police were showing zero-tolerance to criminals, including those involved in narcotics trade. He said that criminals’ collaborators and patrons would also be taken to task.
