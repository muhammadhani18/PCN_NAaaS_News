0,Thousands rally in Niger to push for withdrawal of US troops,"Niamey welcomes Russian military instructors, signs crude oil MOU with Beijing.","NIAMEY: Thousands took to the streets of Niger’s capital on Saturday to demand the departure of US troops, after the ruling junta further shifted its strategy by ending a military accord with the United States and welcoming Russian military instructors.
Niger also signed a memorandum of understanding with Chinese state-owned oil  giant China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) worth $400 million linked to  the sale of crude oil from its Agadem oilfield, Niger state television  RTN reported late on Friday.“China  is a great friend to Niger; we can never say it enough,” Prime Minister  and Minister of Economy and Finance Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine said at  the signing ceremony, which was broadcast by RTN.
“This signature  demonstrates the friendship ... and fruitful cooperation between the two  states,” Chinese ambassador Jiang Feng said.
An export pipeline  project backed by CNPC subsidiary PetroChina was officially launched  last November, linking the Agadem oilfield to the port of Cotonou in  neighbouring Benin.Previously, the West African country had a  small oil refinery with capacity of around 20,000 bpd that mostly  supplies Niger’s domestic fuel market. 

Niamey welcomes Russian military instructors, signs crude oil MOU with Beijing

Anti-US protest
Marching arm in arm through central Niamey, the crowd waved Nigerien flags in a demonstration that recalled anti-French protests that spurred the withdrawal of France’s forces from Niger last year after the army seized power in a coup.
One hand-written sign in English read  “USA rush out of Niger,” in a show of support for the junta and its decision in mid-March to revoke an accord that had allowed around 1,000 US military personnel to operate on its territory out of two bases.
“We’re here to say no to the American base, we don’t want Americans on our soil,” said protester Maria Saley on the sidelines of the march.
Until the coup, Niger had remained a key security partner of France and the United States, which used it as a base as part of international efforts to curb a decade-old Islamist insurgency in West Africa’s Sahel region. But the new authorities in Niger have joined juntas in neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso in ending military deals with one-time Western allies, quitting the regional political and economic bloc ECOWAS and fostering closer ties with Russia.
Russian instructors arrive
The arrival on Wednesday of Russian military instructors and equipment was further evidence of the junta’s openness to closer cooperation with Moscow, which is seeking to boost its influence in Africa.
A few Russian flags were visible at the protest, but some citizens said on Friday they did not want the welcome Russian defence assistance to lead to a permanent presence in Niger.

1,Zuma steals the spotlight ahead of South Africa elections,The ex-leader has made headlines almost daily in the southern African nation for a series of political engagements and court battles.,"JOHANNESBURG: With less than two months to South Africa’s crunch election, scandal-tainted former president Jacob Zuma has stolen the spotlight in an unlikely comeback, further wounding the ruling ANC, analysts say.
Arguably the most polarising politician in the country’s history of democracy, Zuma’s politicking can be enthralling or perplexing.
The ex-leader who has made headlines almost daily in the southern African nation for a series of political engagements and court battles over his legitimacy to run in the May 29 poll — remains at the centre of discourse both on and offline. In December Zuma stunningly announced he would campaign for a new party, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK).
That saw him suspended by the African National Congress (ANC), which is on the brink of dropping below 50 per cent of the vote for the first time since it came to power in 1994.
“Zuma’s comeback epitomises his intense anger with the ANC... almost a revenge on a political party that he believes has alienated him,” political analyst Susan Booysen said. “So for his supporters the MK is a form of loyal revenge.” 
Many believed the 82-year-old’s career would end when he was sentenced to 15 months in jail in June 2021 after refusing to testify to a panel probing financial corruption and cronyism under his presidency.
He was later freed on medical parole just two months into his term, but his jailing sparked protests, riots and looting that left more than 350 dead in South Africa’s worst violence since the advent of democracy. But why does the prominent freedom fighter turned corruption emblem still garner so much support? Often the first to sing and dance, captivating large crowds with his jokes and one-liners the politician is constantly leveraging his charisma to hold onto power.

2,US diplomat turned Cuban spy jailed for 15 years,"Victor Manuel Rocha, a naturalised US citizen originally from Colombia, allegedly began aiding Havana as a covert agent.","MIAMI: A former US ambassador who pleaded guilty to spying for Cuba for over four decades was sentenced in federal court on Friday to 15 years in prison.
Victor Manuel Rocha, 73, was arrested in December for what US officials called  “one of the highest-reaching and longest-lasting infiltrations of the United States government by a foreign agent.” Rocha pleaded not guilty in February to charges of conspiring to act as an agent of a foreign government but later accepted a plea deal with federal prosecutors.
Judge Beth Bloom, after a three-and-a-half hour hearing in Miami on Friday, told Rocha she would give him  “the maximum penalty permitted by law.” In addition to the 15-year sentence, Rocha was given a $500,000 fine.
Rocha, a naturalised US citizen originally from Colombia, allegedly began aiding Havana as a covert agent of Cuba’s General Directorate of Intelligence (DGI) in 1981, and his espionage activities continued until his arrest, according to US authorities.

Victor Manuel Rocha, a naturalised US citizen originally from Colombia, allegedly began aiding Havana as a covert agent

Attorney General Merrick Garland, announcing Rocha’s arrest in December, said he had  “repeatedly referred to the United States as ‘the enemy’” and  “repeatedly bragged about the significance of his efforts.” Rocha joined the State Department in 1981 and rose through the ranks as a career diplomat, serving in posts in Havana, Buenos Aires, Mexico City and Washington.
Rocha served on the National Security Council from 1994 to 1995 in the administration of president Bill Clinton, and was the ambassador to Bolivia from 2000 to 2002 under Clinton and George W. Bush. He also served as an adviser to the US military command responsible for Cuba.
The criminal complaint against Rocha details how, over multiple meetings with an undercover FBI agent beginning in November 2022, he  “behaved as a Cuban agent,” praising the communist-ruled island’s late leader Fidel Castro and  “using the term ‘we’ to describe himself and Cuba.”  “Despite swearing an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States, Rocha betrayed the US by secretly working as a Cuban agent for decades,” said Larissa Knapp, executive assistant director of the FBI’s National Security Branch.
“After years of lying and endangering national security and US citizens, he finally accepted responsibility for his actions and received the maximum prison sentence.” Numerous espionage cases have marred relations between the two countries, which have been enemies since Cuba’s Communist revolution in 1959, at the height of the Cold War.
Rocha’s arrest and conviction come around 15 years after the indictment of Walter Kendall Myers and Gwendolyn Myers, an American couple who spied for Cuba for nearly 30 years. Kendall Myers was sentenced to life imprisonment, while his wife was sentenced to over five years. 
And in 2001, military intelligence analyst Ana Montes was arrested on espionage charges, later admitting that she had been gathering intelligence for Cuba for almost a decade.
Cuba has been under a US embargo since 1962, and is on a State Department list of state sponsors of terrorism.

3,Gang behind $686m medicinal cannabis scam arrested,MADRID: Police forces led by Spain have arrested a gang which allegedly defrauded 645 million euros ($686m) from...,"MADRID: Police forces led by Spain have arrested a gang which allegedly defrauded 645 million euros ($686m) from victims in 35 countries in a scam centred around cannabis plants for medicinal use.
The gang mounted a marketing system and attended international cannabis fairs to convince victims to invest in the system, Spanish police said in a statement.
It led the operation with the help of Europol and police forces in five other countries.
Nine suspects, who were not named, were detained on April 11 on suspicion of fraud in Spain, Britain, Germany, Latvia, Poland, Italy and the Dominican Republic.
“The business model offered by this organisation consisted of using the capital transferred from investors to develop partnerships to finance the cultivation of cannabis plants,” Silvia Garrido, Spanish police spokeswoman,  said. “With this system, they promised victims profits of between 70 per cent and 168 per cent per year, depending on the species of cannabis in which they invested.” 
The British National Crime Agency, which took part in the operation, said 180,000 people invested funds in JuicyFields which it called “a notorious and elaborate Ponzi fraud scheme”.

4,Kyiv says situation in east critical; Russia claims taking village,"KYIV: Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrsky, said on Saturday the situation on the eastern front had...","KYIV: Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrsky, said on Saturday the situation on the eastern front had worsened significantly as Russia claimed the capture of a village near the occupied industrial town of Avdiivka.
“The situation on the eastern front has deteriorated significantly in recent days,” said Syrsky, who took over as commander-in-chief in February after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky fired his popular predecessor, Valery Zaluzhny.
Russia’s defence ministry announced its troops had  “liberated” the village of Pervomaiske in the Donetsk region, about 11 km west of the largely destroyed town of Avdiivka, captured by Russia in the middle of February.
Ukraine has not confirmed the loss. Its army said that it had repelled attacks on the village.
On his Telegram channel, Syrsky wrote of  “a significant intensification of the enemy’s offensive after the presidential elections in Russia” last month.
The commander-in-chief added decisions were being taken  “to strengthen the most problematic defence areas with electronic warfare and air defence”.
In the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Russia accused Ukraine on Saturday of killing 10 by shelling the occupied town of Tokmak. The town fell to Russia at the start of the invasion. Ukrainian authorities in Zaporizhzhia said Russia had struck the region more than 400 times over the last day, including from planes.
Ukraine has also said the situation around the eastern frontline city of Chasiv Yar is  “difficult and tense” with the area under  “constant fire”. Chasiv Yar lies 20 kilometres west of the town of Bakhmut, which was flattened by months of artillery fire before it was captured by Moscow last May.
Russia is now securing fresh territorial gains and trying to press onwards against Ukrainian units hobbled by delays in the supply of vital Western military aid.
Patriot system
Germany on Saturday announced it would send a Patriot air defence system to Ukraine, the third it has supplied so far, citing  “massive and ongoing Russian airstrikes”.
Zelensky thanked German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for  “a real manifestation of support for Ukraine at a critical time for us”.
In the east, Russia  “is actively attacking our positions in the Lyman and Bakhmut sectors ... In the Pokrovsk sector, they are trying to break through our defence using dozens of tanks and armoured personnel carriers,” Syrsky said.
“The issue of achieving technical superiority over the enemy in high-tech weapons has again arisen. Only this will enable us to defeat a larger enemy,” Syrsky said.
F-16 aircraft 
“The second serious problem is to improve the quality of training of military personnel, especially infantry units, so that they can make the most of all the capabilities of military equipment and Western weapons,” Syrsky added.
European allies of Ukraine are engaged in a training push for its forces.
France’s defence minister Sebastien Lecornu said future Ukrainian fighter pilots likely to fly American F-16 aircraft were receiving their initial training in the south of France.
Other countries including the Netherlands, Denmark and Romania are seeking to help Ukraine train pilots.

His audience included entrepreneurs, retirees and even a six-year-old who reached eagerly for a frame pulled from the box, as Tsai demonstrated how bees can be kept calm with a smoker.
“Many join my class out of curiosity,” said the 43-year-old instructor who also heads the Bee and Wasp Conservation Association of Taiwan.
“They want to learn more about this insect, which has important economic values and a crucial role in agriculture.” Bee populations around the world are facing disaster from overuse of pesticides, predatory mites and extreme temperatures due to climate change.
That also spells catastrophe for humans, as three-quarters of the world’s main crops depend on bees to act as key pollinators.
Temperature and weather fluctuations in Taiwan have impacted honey output in recent years. From 2020 to 2021, it jumped nearly 60 per cent to 13,260 tonnes, before dropping to 9,332 tonnes the following year.
Tsai said recreational beekeeping in Taiwan has grown steadily over the past decade, with people tending about a dozen to up to 60 hive boxes in their yards or rooftop gardens. “The city is overdeveloped with less green space and declining biodiversity,” he said. “We hope this creature will act as a key to open more knowledge about nature and ecosystems.”

6,Airlines redirect flights amid soaring Middle East tensions,The flights to the Iranian capital have been suspended since April 6.,"FRANKFURT: German airline Lufthansa said its planes would no longer use Iranian airspace as it extended a suspension on flights to and from Tehran amid soaring Middle East tensions.
“Due to the current situation, Lufthansa is suspending its flights to and from Tehran up to and including Thursday, 18 April,” a company spokesperson said on Friday.
“The airline is also no longer using Iranian airspace.” Its subsidiary Austrian Airlines followed suit.
The flights to the Iranian capital have been suspended since April 6. Lufthansa did not outline the immediate reasons for the suspension. In a statement, Austrian Airlines cited  “the current situation in the Middle East”.
“For Austrian Airlines, the safety of its passengers and crews has top priority. The situation in the Middle East is being evaluated on an ongoing basis. To this end, Austrian is in close contact with the authorities”.
The move comes after Iran blamed arch-foe Israel for a strike in Syria this month that killed two Iranian generals, and threatened reprisals.
Israel has stepped up strikes against Iran-linked targets in Syria since the war in the Gaza Strip began in October.Australian  airline Qantas said on Saturday it would redirect its long-haul flights  between Perth and London to avoid Iran’s airspace amid soaring Middle  East tensions.
A Qantas spokesperson said the airline would  temporarily adjust the flight paths due to  “the situation in parts of  the Middle East”.
“We’ll reach out to customers directly if there’s any change to their booking,” the spokesperson said. The  Perth-London flight, which is usually a non-stop 17-and-a-half hour  journey, will now stop in Singapore to refuel, allowing it to carry a  full load of passengers on an alternate route.
The return service — London to Perth — will continue to fly non-stop on a readjusted path due to prevailing winds. All other flights are not affected.
Qantas  joins other airlines including Lufthansa and its subsidiary Austrian  Airlines in redirecting flights to avoid Iranian airspace.Dutch  airline KLM will no longer fly over Israel and Iran, Dutch press agency  ANP reported on Saturday, citing a KLM spokesperson.
KLM, the  Dutch arm of Air France-KLM, said the move was a precaution, referring  to the rising tensions between Iran and Israel, but added that it would  continue flying to Tel Aviv, on Israel’s Mediterranean coast.

7,"Settlers kill Palestinian, torch cars and homes",The attacks escalated in several villages after Achimeir’s body was found near the Malachi Hashalom outpost.,"JERUSALEM: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday condemned the  death of an Israeli teenager in the occupied West Bank as attacks on Palestinian villages intensified following news of his death.
After Benjamin Achimeir, 14, was reported missing near Ramallah on Friday, hundreds of Jewish settlers backed by Israeli forces raided nearby Palestinian villages, torching cars and homes, and left at least one villager dead and dozens wounded.
The attacks escalated in several villages on Saturday after Achimeir’s body was found near the Malachi Hashalom outpost. Correspondents saw smoke rising from burnt houses and fields.
The mayor of nearby Al-Mughayyir village, Amin Abu Alyah, said: “Dozens of settlers are now attacking the village and burning everything they find in front of them. They burned a house, a bulldozer and a number of vehicles.” Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa condemned the attacks and urged the authorities to help the people of Al-Mughayyir.
Netanyahu said Israeli forces were  “in an intensive pursuit after the heinous murderers and all those who collaborated with them”.
“The heinous murder of the boy Binyamin Achimair is a serious crime,” he said.
Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned  “revenge” attacks would make it difficult for security forces to find the perpetrators. “The law must not be taken into one’s own hands,” he wrote on social media.
Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said “violent riots of the settlers are a dangerous violation of the law and interfere with the security forces.” 
Hundreds of thousands of Israelis live in West Bank settlements considered illegal under international law. With tensions already high in the face of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Israeli security forces and hundreds of volunteers formed a huge search party to look for Achimeir on Friday.
Jewish settlers who were part of the manhunt raided Al-Mughayyir, firing shots and torching homes and cars in the village while residents responded by throwing stones, journalists reported.
At least one person was killed and 25 wounded, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday.
Overnight, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that five Palestinians were wounded in another settler attack in Abu Falah village near Ramallah.
On Saturday Suleiman Dawabsha, mayor of Duma near Nablus, said the West Bank had been  “in a real state of war since yesterday”.
He said Israeli troops and settlers had set fire to more than 15 houses and 10 farms in his village.
The West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, has seen a surge in violence since early last year.
At least 462 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or settlers in the West Bank, according to Palestinian official figures.
Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the rights situation in the Palestinian territories, urged the UN to “authorise the deployment of a protective presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, with the explicit mandate to prevent and (repel) attacks against civilians”.
“The Israeli army has abundantly proven unwilling or unable to ensure that task,” she wrote on X.

8,Passengers rescued from Turkiye cable car accident after 23 hours,"A total of 174 passengers, including children, were “successfully” rescued from at least 16 cable cars.","ISTANBUL: Rescue workers finished evacuating dozens of passengers trapped for 23 hours mid-air on Saturday after a cable car accident in southern Turkiye that killed one person.
Ten people were injured in the accident, which happened late on Friday afternoon in the resort city of Antalya when a supporting pylon collapsed.
One cable car in the Sarisu-Tunektepe system plummeted into a rocky area, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said.
A total of 174 passengers, including children, were  “successfully” rescued from at least 16 cable cars after a  “very dangerous operation”, said Okay Memis, the head of Turkiye’s disaster and emergency management agency Afad.
“This accident occurred following the breakage of a mechanism at the top of a cable car pylon,” Memis added.
The remaining 43 passengers who were suspended in the air were finally freed on Saturday afternoon.
Ayse Hatice Polat, a woman in her fifties who had been trapped in a cabin for more than twenty-one hours, kissed the ground as she descended from the helicopter, several local media reported.
Ten helicopters and more than 600 rescuers, including specialist mountaineers, had been at the scene, authorities said.
Thirteen people, including managers of the cable car company, faced detention orders as part of an investigation into the causes of the accident, Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said.
“The incident occurred because of inadequate and corroded fastenings at the connection points of the cable car’s support towers,” Tunc said on X, formerly Twitter, referring to a preliminary report that also pointed to the poor condition of the pulley systems.
Twenty-four  cabins were stranded in the air at 5:23pm on Friday.  Sixteen hours later, more than 60 people were still stranded in the  remaining nine cabins in the air, the ministry said.
None of the people waiting to be  rescued had critical injuries or were in poor health, Disaster and  Emergency Management Authority chairman Okay Memis told reporters at the  scene.
In  a statement on social media platform X, the interior ministry said  seven helicopters and more than 500 rescue workers were carrying out  rescue efforts.
A video released by the interior ministry showed rescue personnel tied to safety ropes climbing into cabins.
According  to the information on its website, the cable car has 36 cabins with a  capacity of six people each, and it takes an average of nine minutes to  go uphill to the Tunektepe facility with panoramic views of the city of  Antalya.

9,"Trump holds rally, Biden plans tax speech as rematch heats up",Pennsylvania is a top prize in the election race,"PHILADELPHIA: Former US President Donald Trump heads to the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday for a rally and a fundraiser, just days before he is set to go on trial in New York over an alleged hush money scheme.
He will be closely followed by President Joe Biden, who will make three Pennsylvania stops next week, speaking first in his hometown of Scranton about his push to reform the US tax code.
With 19 electoral votes — one of the highest counts among all 50 states — and voters that swing between backing Democrats like Biden and Republicans like Trump, Pennsylvania is a top prize in the 2024 presidential election and is likely to see many more visits in coming months.
Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020 by less than 1.5pc, or roughly 80,000 votes, after Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by less than 45,000 votes in 2016. State opinion polls taken in March swing from showing Biden with a 10-percentage-point lead to Trump up 4 points, election data site FiveThirtyEight shows.

Pennsylvania is a top prize in the election race

Democrats are betting on a strong turnout in Philadelphia and its surrounding suburbs, a region that accounts for 33pc of all voting registrations, to offset losses throughout much of the rest of the state. Trump and Republicans are looking to run up huge margins in less populous, largely white counties to offset urban votes. Biden, who has been to Pennsylvania four times so far this year, will also travel to the Pittsburgh area and Philadelphia over three days, the White House said.
Trump is expected to be in Manhattan on Monday for the beginning of his first criminal trial, a case involving hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. The trial could last several weeks. 
Trump’s Saturday rally at Schnecksville Fire Hall targeted the Lehigh Valley, a mix of Rust Belt cities, sprawling suburbs and rural towns. It includes Northampton County, one of two counties Biden flipped in 2020, which has long been a reliable bellwether of statewide success.
“If you win Northampton County, you are likely to win the state. It’s that important of a location,” Chris Borick, a political science professor at Pennsylvania’s Muhlenberg University, said of Trump’s rally.
The former president will attend a fundraiser before his rally in Bucks County, another bellwether region that Biden narrowly won in 2020. The event is hosted by Jim Worthington, a wealthy gym owner who has pressured Trump to stop criticizing mail-in voting. Roughly 200 people are expected, and the event should generate several million dollars, according to two sources familiar with the event. It will be a “razor-thin race,” Borick predicted.
Pennsylvania is a sprawling, politically complex place where voters historically have often elevated consensus-minded statewide candidates, a history that could affect the closely watched US Senate race.
Incumbent Bob Casey, a Democrat, will battle Republican Dave McCormick, a wealthy former hedge fund executive, one of just a handful of races in 2024 that will decide who controls the Senate.
Population shifts could also affect the race. Pennsylvania’s population topped 13 million in 2021, but has declined in the two ensuing years, finishing at 12.96m people last year.

10,"North Korea’s Kim, top Chinese official hail ‘new chapter’ in ties","Zhao Leji is China’s third highest-ranking official, behind President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang.","SEOUL: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and China’s top legislator hailed a “new chapter” of Beijing-Pyongyang relations on Saturday, in one of the most high-level meetings between the allies in years.
Beijing’s third highest-ranking official Zhao Leji — a member of the powerful Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo — made a goodwill visit to the nuclear-armed North this week as the two countries mark 75 years of diplomatic ties.
China is North Korea’s most important economic benefactor and diplomatic ally, obstructing US-led efforts at the UN Security Council alongside Russia to impose stricter sanctions on Kim Jong Un’s government in response to its increased weapons tests.
Zhao met Kim on Saturday, after attending an opening ceremony on Friday for the  “year of China-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Friendship” in Pyongyang on Friday, according to Beijing’s state news agency Xinhua.

Zhao told Kim that China is “willing to strengthen development linkage and deepen bilateral cooperation with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” according to Xinhua, using the North’s official name.
Zhao told Kim that China is willing to  “promote bilateral practical and mutually beneficial cooperation to achieve new results, to continue to give strong mutual support and to safeguard the common interests of both sides”.
Kim in turn told Zhao the North was keen to  “deepen the traditional friendship and write a new chapter in Democratic People’s Republic of Korea-China relations,” according to Xinhua.
A photo published by Xinhua showed Zhao and Kim smiling and shaking hands.
Zhao is China’s third highest-ranking official, behind President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang.
‘Eternal friendship’
Zhao earlier emphasised the need to  “open up a new chapter of China-DPRK friendship along with the times”, in a speech at the opening ceremony on Friday, which he attended alongside North Korean counterpart Choe Ryong Hae, according to North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency.
North Korea’s Choe said on Friday that the two countries’ relationship  “has greeted a new heyday under the wise leadership” of their leaders, KCNA said.
Choe and Zhao were seen sitting next to each other watching performances by what KCNA said were  “prestigious art troupes” of the two nations at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre, AFP footage showed.
Some performers wore colourful traditional Korean and Chinese garments, and what appeared to be the final moment of the event highlighted a massive image of the countries’ flags, accompanied by the phrase  “eternal friendship”.
South Korean local media reports said this week that Zhao’s trip could include planning for Kim’s next potential state visit to Beijing.
Kim last met President Xi in 2019 before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, making the Pyongyang meeting between Zhao and Choe one of the most high-level meetings in years.
The Chinese delegation was seen off by senior North Korean officials as they boarded their plane departing Pyongyang on Saturday, Xinhua said.
North Korea’s rhetoric towards the South has been in stark contrast to the friendly relations with Beijing.
This year, Kim has declared Seoul his country’s  “principal enemy”, jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over “even 0.001 mm” of territorial infringement.
China’s state-run news agency Xinhua said that Zhao and Choe discussed the  “situation on the Korean peninsula”, and Zhao expressed Beijing’s willingness to “intensify legislative exchanges and cooperation”.
