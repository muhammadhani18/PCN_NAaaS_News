0,Saudi FM to visit Pakistan for bilateral economic cooperation,Pakistan hoping to attract billions of dollars in investment from kingdom,"A high-level delegation from Saudi Arabia, led by Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah, is scheduled to arrive in Pakistan on April 15 (today) for a two-day visit.
The visit aims to fast-track the implementation of agreements made between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman during their recent meeting in Makkah.
The discussions will focus on strengthening bilateral economic cooperation between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
The delegation comprises key officials including Saudi Minister of Water and Agriculture Eng Abdul Rahman Abdul Mohsen Al-Fadley, Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources Bandar Ibrahim AlKhorayef, Deputy Minister of Investment Badr AlBadr, Head of Saudi Special Committee Mohammad Mazyed Al Towaijri, and senior officials from the Ministry of Energy and Saudi Fund for General Investments.
During its stay, the Saudi delegation is expected to engage in meetings with the president, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and relevant ministers, as well as the chief of army staff and the apex committee of SIFC.
The visit is anticipated to provide a significant boost to bilateral cooperation and foster a mutually beneficial economic partnership between the two nations.
Earlier, people familiar with the development told The Express Tribune that the top Saudi diplomat will be accompanied by key ministers from the kingdom, including energy and investment.
Investments
The visit is a follow-up of PM Shehbaz's recent trip to Saudi Arabia where he held wide-ranging talks with the Saudi crown prince. The primary objective of his visit was to persuade the Saudi government to help Pakistan revitalise its economy through investments.
In the wake of the meeting between the prime minister and the de facto Saudi ruler, both parties reached an agreement to accelerate the process of a $5 billion investment, previously discussed between the two nations.
Sources close to the matter revealed that the Saudi crown prince informed PM Shehbaz about sending a high-level delegation to Islamabad shortly to finalise the details of the investment.

Pakistan is hoping to attract billions of dollars in investment from Saudi Arabia as part of its initiative under the banner of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), a civil-military forum aimed at removing bottlenecks and other bureaucratic hurdles hindering foreign investment.
Islamabad is offering Saudi investors stakes in the multi-billion-dollar Reko Diq mine projects. Similarly, the SIFC is keen for Saudis to invest in the agricultural sector.
Sources have indicated that the Saudi foreign minister and other delegation members will receive detailed presentations about the potential areas of investment.
Pakistan is eager for investments to commence sooner rather than later, as it will not only enhance foreign reserves but also stimulate economic growth.
Pakistan requires an injection of billions of dollars if it wants to meet its external liabilities and avoid repeatedly turning to international financial institutions for bailouts.
The SIFC was established to tackle the country's economic challenges through foreign investment. Pakistan aims to attract $70 billion in investment from Gulf countries over the next 3 to 5 years.
Observers, however, remain sceptical, stating that much depends on political stability and the tangible projects offered to investors.
One factor that may potentially undermine Pakistan's plans is the growing uncertainty in the region. The recent Iranian retaliatory strikes on Israel could alter the dynamics.
Meanwhile, despite escalating tensions in the region, sources indicate that Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi's visit is proceeding as planned.
The visit was in doubt following Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel in retaliation for the bombing of its diplomatic mission in Damascus a fortnight ago.
However, diplomatic sources said there was no change in the schedule of the Iranian president's visit to Pakistan. The Iranian president is expected to travel to Pakistan on April 22.
Sources, however, pointed out the schedule might change if tensions further escalate in the Middle East.
This would be the first visit of any head of state to Pakistan since the new government took charge. The visit also comes three months after Iran and Pakistan exchanged missiles. Iran first launched missiles inside Pakistan targeting what it claimed were terrorist hideouts. Two days later Pakistan retaliated with its own strikes.
But tension quickly de-escalated after the two sides established high-level contacts. The Iranian foreign minister dashed to Islamabad within days of missile exchanges and both sides agreed to defuse tensions.
It was agreed during the visit that the Iranian president would visit Pakistan after the February 8 elections.
In view of the current Middle East tensions, the likely visit of the Iranian president would be closely watched by the outside world.

1,"China ready to further strengthen security cooperation with Pakistan, says envoy",Ambassador Zaidong urges Islamabad to take all measures to ensure protection of Chinese citizens," Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong has said that his country stands ready to further strengthen counterterrorism and security cooperation with Pakistan.
The statement comes after the tragic incident of March 26, wherein six individuals, including five Chinese engineers, lost their lives in a suicide attack in Bisham, a remote area of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province.
During the attack, an explosive-laden vehicle detonated as a convoy, transporting Chinese engineers to the Dasu hydroelectric project site from Islamabad, passed by.
This marked the second assault on Chinese workers at the Dasu project, following a similar terrorist attack in July 2021 that claimed the lives of 13 individuals, including nine engineers.
“We should take the people’s security as the ultimate goal, and effectively protect Chinese citizens in Pakistan. The people are the foundation of a country, and are also what the rule of a country is for,” the Chinese ambassador said.
He said that the national security work is ultimately to protect the interests of the people and enable them to live and work in peace and happiness.
“President Xi Jinping emphasised that we must always put the people first, put the life first, and ensure the life and security of the people. A holistic approach to national security takes the people’s position as the fundamental position, and emphasises that national security is for the people and relies on the people, which clearly reflects President Xi Jinping’s deep feelings for the people,” he added.
Ambassador Zaidong said that Chinese citizens in Pakistan actively participate in Pakistan’s national construction and promote China-Pakistan friendly cooperation. “We should do everything possible to protect their safety and value their contributions.”
He said that it was heart-wrenching that in the recent terrorist attack on 26th March, five Chinese citizens were deprived of their young lives.
“We hope and believe that the Pakistani side will speed up the investigation of the incident, find out the truth, severely punish the perpetrators, raise counterterrorism efforts, resolutely crack down on and root out the evil, and take all measures to protect the safety and security of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in Pakistan, and create favourable conditions for advancing China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperation and building a China-Pakistan community with a shared future,” he added.
The Chinese ambassador said that China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), as an important signature project under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, has effectively promoted Pakistan’s economic and social development since its launching 10 years ago, by bringing in 25.4 billion dollars of direct investment, 236 thousand jobs, 510 KM expressway, more than 8,000 megawatt of power and 886 KM core power transmission grid.
“It is now entering the new phase of building a corridor of growth, livelihood, innovation, greenness and openness. The 26th March terrorist attack showed once again that a secure and stable environment is critical to the practical cooperation between China and Pakistan and the building of CPEC,” he added.
He said that China stands ready to work hand-in-hand with Pakistan to defeat the evil attempt at disrupting the cooperation between the two countries, to safeguard development with security to promote security with development, and to advance high-quality CPEC cooperation.

“We should take the promotion of international security as a support, and further enhance China-Pakistan counterterrorism and security cooperation. While one chopstick is easy to break, a bunch of chopsticks are much more resilient. Faced with the chaotic international security situation, interwoven traditional and non-traditional security threats, and an ever-increasing number of terrorist attacks, all countries need to work together in addressing various security challenges for win-win results.”
Bonded by mountains and rivers, the Chinese ambassador said that China and Pakistan are closely linked in security interests. “We stand ready to work with Pakistan in jointly implementing the Global Security Initiative and building a peaceful and secure homeland. Moreover, the 26th March terrorist attack also showed how violence and terrorism are challenging the bottom line of human civilisation. We must take resolute actions to crackdown on them.
China stands ready to further strengthen counter-terrorism and security cooperation with Pakistan, to maintain high pressure and rigorous operation, so as to decisively strike the rampant terrorism, effectively safeguard the lives and interests of our two peoples and jointly maintain regional peace and security as well as international fairness and justice,” he added.
He said that the strategic significance of China-Pakistan relations has become even more prominent. “Focusing on the new phase of our bilateral ties, we will stick to the guidance of the important consensus between President Xi Jinping and Pakistan’s national leaders, carry forward our traditional friendship, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in various fields, jointly build an upgraded version of CPEC, continuously deepen the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership, stand shoulder-to-shoulder in facing global changes, and build an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era,” he added.
In this significant process, he said that China stands ready to implement a holistic approach to national security together with Pakistan, to promote the Global Security Initiative for tangible results, and to write a chapter on security in building the China-Pakistan community with a shared future, so as to safeguard the common interests and benefit the two peoples during the centennial changes.

2,Pakistan concerned over escalation in ME,"Islamabad calls on all parties to exercise utmost restraint and move towards de-escalation, says FO","Pakistan expressed deep concern over the escalating situation in the Middle East following Iran's missile and drone strikes towards its arch enemy Israel. Describing the recent events as a breakdown of diplomacy, the Foreign Office in a statement emphasized the urgent necessity for de-escalation.
The statement urged all parties to exercise utmost restraint and work towards restoring peace in the volatile region.

“Today’s developments demonstrate the consequences of the breakdown of diplomacy. These also underline the grave implications in cases where the UN Security Council is unable to fulfil its responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security,” the statement said.
“It is now critically urgent to stabilise the situation and restore peace. We call on all parties to exercise utmost restraint and move towards de-escalation. For months, Pakistan has underlined the necessity of international efforts to prevent expansion of hostilities in the region and for Gaza ceasefire,” it added.
Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles towards Israel late on Saturday, the first-ever direct assault on Israeli territory that came in retaliation for a deadly air strike on Tehran’s consulate in the Syrian capital earlier this month.
The attack, which injured 12 people in Israel, came as fighting between Israel and Hamas raged in Gaza. Most of the drones and missiles were intercepted before reaching Israel, with help from the United States, Jordan, Britain and other allies, the Israeli army said.
The Iranian army declared that its attack was “completed successfully”, and that it was in “self defence” after the Israel’s strike in Damascus, which killed seven of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards including two generals on April 1.
A day after the Israeli attack, Pakistan had termed the assault a major escalation. “On 2, April 2024, Pakistan had pointed to the dangers of the attack on Iranian consular office in Syria as a major escalation in an already volatile region,” the Foreign Office statement said.

This negative attitude had created hate and divisions, he remarked adding the Seerat Museum would not only raise awareness about the life, character and teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) but would also educate people how to live their lives and manage relationships with other people.
The museum would familiarise people outside the world with the life and character of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and nullify the negative propaganda, he noted.
He thanked His Majesty King Salman bin Abdul Aziz as well as the Crown Prince His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz for extending their cooperation for the project of the Seerat Museum.
He said the people of Pakistan would never forget the adoration of the leadership of Saudi Arabia whose landmarks were spread all over Pakistan, like the Faisal Mosque in Islamabad capital. While talking about his recent visit to the two holy mosques in Makkah and Medina and offering of prayers there, he said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz warmly received his delegation and exhibited deep love and affection for Pakistan.
