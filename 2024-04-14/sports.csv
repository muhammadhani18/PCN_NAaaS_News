0,Backlog of passports piling up,Thousands miss Umrah in Ramazan due to delay,"Because of a low stock of lamination paper, the Department of Passports and Immigration, instead of the usual output of about 12,000 passports daily, is delivering only up to 3,000, mostly urgent and e-passports.
Applicants paying the normal fees have to wait for about four months.
According to sources, more than 7,000 intending pilgrims from various cities were deprived of the opportunity to perform Umrah in Ramazan due to the passport delays.
According to the department, the lamination paper has once again run out. It imports the paper from France, but the consignment was delayed due to a shortage of dollars.
As a result, passports with normal fees have been significantly delayed, with the waiting time extending to four months instead of the usual 15 to 20 days.
More than 150,000 passports are pending with the department. Passports are being issued only to the urgent and fast-track fee payers. Despite generating annual revenue of Rs120 billion, the department has struggled to purchase lamination paper on time.
The sources said the ink and printers for the machine-readable passports are sourced from Germany. The department has the capacity to produce 25,000 passports per day, but the number of applications received exceeds 40,000 per day.
Every day, approximately 25,000 people from across Punjab, visit the offices to apply for passports. Many of them leave disappointed as passports are not available even after waiting in queues for hours.
Applicants Rana Abid, Faisal Nasir and Amjad Alvi said while speaking to The Express Tribune that they had applied for passports between November and January to perform Umrah in Ramazan but had yet to receive them, despite making payments to travel agents.
They said they are told to wait a few more days each time they visit the passport office.
Passports applied for in November are currently being processed, while those applied for in December, January, and February will be issued later.
The sources said the department was estimated to have received over Rs1 billion in fees from the applicants awaiting passports.
When contacted, the DG of passport and immigration attributed the delays to the shortage of lamination paper, exacerbated by issues related to the French company supplying the paper.
The DG said the problem had been solved and all pending passports would be issued by June.

3,VC asks officials to foil land occupation,Court summons district administration to file reply by April 30,"The Lahore High Court (LHC) has issued a restraining order against Zafar Iqbal Nagra, a member of the provincial assembly, preventing him from occupying a piece of land measuring 18 kanals and 19 marlas.
This land was allotted to the University of Agriculture in 1962, and after extensive legal battles, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled in favor of the University in a judgment dated February 13, 2001.
The LHC has summoned the district administration to file a reply by April 30, 2024.
University of Agriculture Faisalabad Vice Chancellor Dr Iqrar Ahmed Khan has written separate letters to the deputy commissioner and the city police officer, urging them to use the full force of the law to prevent illegal occupation of the land by individuals claiming it as an Eidgah.
He also notified the Chief Minister's office that the illegal occupation of public property by an MPA of the ruling party would attract negative publicity.
The correspondence from the VC highlighted that the MPA has been unlawfully occupying university land under the pretext of Anjuman-e-Data Ganj Buksh Ali Hajvary (ADGBH), Darbar Baba Qaim Sain.
A meeting was held by the Senior Member of the Board of Revenue on April 4, 2024, regarding the issue of the janazgah.
The university has maintained the janazgah since 2019, while no Eidgah or Eid event has taken place during their possession of the land.
The VC further alleged that Nagra and former MNA Raja Riaz Ahmad are trying to incite a law and order situation by falsely informing the neighbourhood that the government has permitted the use of university land as an Eidgah.
This scheme, according to the VC, is aimed at unlawfully acquiring university land for personal gain.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, the UAF VC stated that Nagra and his family have unlawfully gained at least Rs21.57 million from the land since the Supreme Court's decision in 2001 up to 2019.
A request has been submitted to district collector and divisional administration authorities to recover this amount from Zafar Iqbal Nagra.
Attempts to reach Zafar Iqbal Nagra for comment were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Raja Riaz clarified that the land belongs to the Punjab government but has been used by the Anjuman-e-Data Ganj Buksh Ali Hajvary under the supervision of Darbar Baba Qaim Sain.
“The Punjab Board of Revenue has affirmed our ownership claim, and we will endeavour to preserve the land for use as an Eidgah or janazgah.”
He refuted the assertion made by the VC of UAF that we intend to encroach on the land.
Instead, he emphasised that people have the right to offer Eid or funeral prayers, and we will not permit anyone to infringe upon these rights.
