4,Transparency International Pakistan’s corruption report about judiciary not credible: PHC,Court declares positive findings about judiciary not mentioned in report.,"PESHAWAR: Declaring the Transparency International Pakistan’s National Corruption Perception Survey (NCPS) 2023 report key findings related to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa judiciary not credible, Peshawar High Court has ruled that it is suffering from ethical and methodological rigour.
“These unreliable and invalid findings tend to bring the judiciary into disrepute as well as fuelling ridicule of judiciary on public forums and media, especially social media,” rules a single-member bench comprising PHC Chief Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan.
 
 

In its 31-page detailed judgment released on Saturday, the bench observed: “This is very concerning that TIP admitted before the court in its response of 15 January 2024 that 87% respondents have perceived judiciary nationally as ‘clean’ and merely l3 % perceive it as ‘corrupt’ but this key information was not included in NCPS 2023 report.”
“Similarly, TIP admitted that in KP, 85% respondents perceived judiciary clean whereas only l5% perceived it corrupt but this key explanation was not included in NCPS 2023,” the bench observed.

Court declares positive findings about judiciary not mentioned in report

“TIP also claimed in relation to KP judiciary that compared to NCPS 2022, the perception of the judiciary in KP has improved 57%. This is the highest improvement witnessed by any department across Pakistan as per NCPS 2023. This finding, like the 87% and 85% clean claims, was not included in NCPS 2023,” the court observed, adding that this would have been encouraging for the nation and taxpayers of Pakistan to know the 87% and 85% clean findings regarding their judiciary.
“These claims would have also boosted the morale and confidence of those working in judiciary,” the bench observed, adding that TIP had only reported negative findings regarding the judiciary.
Similarly, the bench observed that TIP did not mention that only five of the 39 respondents claimed to have paid bribe to access judiciary in KP.
It is pertinent to mention that on Dec 14, 2023, the PHC director of human rights cell had submitted a complaint to chief justice along with press clippings of newspapers wherein the key findings of TIP’s NCPS were reported.
The key findings in relation to KP judiciary was that it was the second most corrupt sector and that citizens paid the highest bribe of Rs162,000 to access judiciary. The PHC chief justice started proceedings over the said complaint and issued notice to TIP, which was represented by advocates Hashmat Ali Habib, Nadia Huma Hashmat and others.
The bench also appointed Prof Niaz A Shah of University of Hull, as amicus curiae, who appeared through video link and submitted his detailed findings on the report.
On April 8, the bench pronounced its judgment wherein it ordered TIP to recall its NCPS 2023 report and issue a revised report in the light of the judgment. It was further ordered that the revised report should be published and circulated in the manner and form of NCPS 2023.
In the detailed judgment, the bench observed that TIP failed to mention the inherent limitation of the perception survey in its report. The bench observed that in its response, TIP admitted that ‘this perception does not necessarily mean reality but is shaped by the citizens’ opinions and experiences. “It does not mean that the department, sector, or institution is corrupt or has financial irregularity.”
However, the bench observed that TIP did not explain in its two responses to the court as to why it failed to mention the inherent limitation in its NCPS 2023. It added that without explaining the limitation, key finding in relation to key question may mislead lay public which, in turn, contributed to public misperception about the judiciary. “Misperceptions lead to erosion of public trust and confidence in the judiciary and, in some cases, fuel public ridicule and scorn.”
The bench observed: “TIP’s intention and aim of improving institutions across the country is laudable. TIP has, however, done itself and the institutions it wants to assist and improve a huge disfavour by not following ethical and methodological rigour; properly analysing data and reporting full findings in NCPS 2023.”
The bench further stated: “The Constitution of Pakistan and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) protect the right to freedom of expression not only of individuals, journalists, etc but also afford protection to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as they raise awareness through their functions on issues of public importance. The contribution of NGOs on issues of public importance is undeniable.”
“Their rights and role, however, come with great responsibilities and duties to those who they engage in their activities such as surveys, the institutions they aim to research and broadly the public. Article 19(3) of ICCPR has specially mentioned that the exercise of this right ‘carries with it special duties and responsibilities’. NGOs, like other organisations and institutions have to operate within the limits imposed by law especially human rights law and the fundamental rights contained in the constitution of Pakistan,” the bench observed.
“In this case, it is the right of public and the institution funded by their taxes to question the validity, reliability and credibility of research findings by NGOs so that the judiciary is not unfairly ridiculed and brought into disrepute. Maintaining public trust and confidence in the judiciary is the sine qua non for the fair administration of justice in a democratic society. Access to justice and fair administration of justice is a fundamental right of people,” the bench maintained.

They said the priceof chicken meat had also jumped to Rs600 per kg against the official rate of Rs510 per kg.
They said tomato was sold at Rs100 per kg a week ago, but its price jumped to Rs180 per kg two days before Eidul Fitr and to Rs250 per kg the next day. On Saturday, tomato was being sold at Rs450 per kg in the vegetable market in the district headquarters, and its rate was more than that in far-off areas of Swabi, the consumers complained.
They said tomato rate increased around Eid because it was a vital ingredient in preparing various special dishes on the festive occasion.
Surprisingly, the district administration has fixed the tomato rate at Rs140 and Rs150 per kg, respectively, for the Thatta and Tangi varieties, and from Rs180 to Rs200 per kg for Bella region variety.
However, traders have disregarded the official price list and are overcharging consumers without any fear.
“It is an artificial increase made by traders just to exploit the people’s need for tomatoes at Eid,” Fayaz Ali of Swabi city said. The consumers said the district administration had failed to take action against the profiteers.
Mohammad Jamil of Maneri Bala village said the district administration remained dormant, giving traders free hand to fleece consumers. Prices of fruits have also witnessed an increase, he complained.
Officials said that prices of tomato and other vegetables fluctuated depending upon the supply and demand situation.
ACCIDENTS: Three persons were injured when a motorcycle and a rickshaw collided at Topi Safdar Chowk on Saturday, rescue officials said.
They said an emergency rescue team provided first aid to all the injured and shifted them to Bacha Khan Teaching Hospital, Shahmansoor. The injured were identified as Abdul Majeed, 20, Zubair Khan, and Ismail Khan. They belong to Baja village.
Meanwhile, a man was injured when a car fell into a ditch on the Topi Bypass Road. The injured man was identified as Zeeshan Khan, 18, hailing from Mangal Chai area of Gadoon Amazai. He was taken to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital.

Kaleemullah, a visitor, told this scribe that tall trees in mountains, lush green pastures, springs in Tirah and breathing in the pure environment cast a soothing mental effect on people.
Hashim Khan, another picnicker, termed the valley a blessing for people. He said that a visit to Galiyat, Murree and Naran-Kaghan cost Rs100,000 to Rs200,000 to a family but it was economical for people to visit Tirah, which had the same natural beauty.

Mr Khan said that a visit to Tirah valley took away all mental burdens and refreshed mind of people. “The birds here are also different having unique colours and appearances I have never seen in cities or nearby,” he added.
However, tourists complained about the absence of restaurants and hotels for a stay. They added that the area remained unexplored and did not get proper attention from tourism department.
Malik Inayat Orakzai said that the charming view and taste of abundant wild fruits of apples, apricots, walnuts, long red colored jujube and wild pomegranate in Tirah were matchless.
He said that hundreds-year-old cave in a mountain with an opening on the other side was worth viewing. He added that the cave was still a mystery as to why and who had dug it.

8,KP set to roll out policy for pharmaceutical services,Official says doctors will prescribe medicines using formulas instead of brand names,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department has drafted the province’s first Pharmacy Services Policy, promising to ensure pharmaceutical services are safe and effective and medicines are affordable for people.
It will present the policy to the cabinet in its next meeting for mandatory approval, according to a senior official of the department.
“The policywill help augment the process of ISO certification for healthcare facilities and drug testing labs and would pave the way for integration of pharmacy services with hospitals,” he told Dawn.
The official said the department examined the proposed policy in a meeting last week, and health minister Syed Qasim Ali Shah promised to get it approved by the cabinet without delay for early enforcement to benefit patients.

Official says doctors will prescribe medicines using formulas instead of brand names

Under the proposed policy, a copy of which is available with Dawn, doctors will prescribe medicines based on formulas instead of brand names to reduce drug-related expenses and ensure proper medication use.
There are plans to establish the Drug Information and Poison Control Centre and a drug testing laboratory at the divisional level to provide guidance on poisoning or drug overdoses online or over the phone.
“A pharmacy and therapeutic committee comprising heads of medicine and surgery departments, in charges of pharmacists, and representatives of nurses will be established at each hospital to oversee medication management and use.
“It will review the process of selection and procurement of medications, overview the storage of medications in the respective institutions, and ensure safe practices in ordering, prescribing, preparation, and dispensing in addition to development and maintenance. The committee will nominate a focal person in the pharmacy staff for reporting adverse drug reactions as per the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan’s guidelines,” the policy read.
Officials said the involvement of pharmacists in clinical contributions for direct patient care had increased, not only proving effective but also promising relief to hospital visitors.
They said the department wanted to promote the concepts of pharmaceutical care, the implementation of safe medication practices, the identification and curtailment of adverse drug effects and drug interactions, the minimisation of irrational prescriptions, and cost effectiveness through formulary management and active involvement in hospital rounds.
The officials said under theDRAPAct, 2012, pharmacy services meant services rendered by a pharmacist in pharmaceutical care, selection, posology, counseling, dispensing, use, administration, prescription monitoring, pharmacoepidemiology, therapeutic goods information and poison control, pharmacovigilance, pharmacoeconomics, storage, sales, procurement, forecasting, supply chain management, distribution, drug utilisation evaluation, drug utilisation review, formulary based drug utilisation, and managing therapeutic goods at all levels, including pharmacy, clinic, medical store, hospital, or medical institution.
They added that clinical pharmacists assumed responsibility and accountability for managing medication therapy in direct patient care settings, whether practicing independently or in consultation or collaboration with other healthcare professionals.
Medication errors or adverse drug events are a single aspect of clinical pharmacy services, according to them.
The officials said Agha Khan University Hospital, Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Shifa International Hospitals, and other leading national health organisation had utilised the services of pharmacists to establish pharmacy services, which were playing a pivotal role in ensuring outstanding health services there.
Officials said under the proposed policy, eight pharmacists would be employed in a Category A hospital, four in a Category B one, three each in TB, burns, and trauma centres, two in a Category C one, one each in Category D, district officer offices, and tehsil level facilities, and four analysts and as many chemists as well as one microbiologist at drug testing labs to be set up at the divisional level.
They said the province, which was short of pharmacists, was the first in the province to establish a separate drug directorate-general, which issued e-drug sale licences to provide online access to drug testing lab reports.
The officials said the proposed policy’s implementation will help curb counterfeit and substandard medicines.
They said currently, the province had 56 drug inspectors, only for monitoring 17,000 pharmacies.

11,Boating ban ‘disappoints’ Sardaryab visitors,CHARSADDA: The abrupt ban on boating in the River Kabul dampened the spirits of visitors to the popular Sardaryab...,"CHARSADDA: The abrupt ban on boating in the River Kabul dampened the spirits of visitors to the popular Sardaryab picnic spot here during Eid days.
The district administration slapped the ban after a boat capsized in the river near Kund Park, Nowshera, killing eight people.
Sardaryab attracted holidaymakers, including youth and children, in large numbers from across Charsadda and adjoining Peshawar and Mardan districts on Eid. They showed up to ride boats, camels, horses, and swings, eat fish, and relish other local delicacies.
However, the boating ban disappointed them.
They said Sardaryab on the Peshawar-Charsadda border was famous for boat riding, but the ban on it let them down.
The visitors demanded an immediate end to the ban with strict conditions for boat riding.
Boatmen also complained about the ban and said they used to make good money on Eid, but that wasn’t the case this time around due to their misery.
“Eid days always promised us handsome earnings, but that hasn’t happened this Eid due to the boating ban,” a boatman told Dawn.
The boatmen demanded an immediate yet unconditional lifting of the restriction.
They said they’re ready to ride a small number of picnickers in boats, and that, too, with safety gear. Colourful and decorated boats were parked on the riverbank, but people were stopped from riding them.
Salman, a minor boy from Peshawar, told Dawn that he loved riding decorated camels and horses and taking selfies with them.
Sima, a student from the Utmanzai area in Charsadda district, said Sardaryab was an open area that attracted nature lovers.
“I love fried fish at the makeshift stalls here,” she said.
The student demanded separate enclosures for women visitors and stalls of traditional Charsadda chappal and Rajjar sweets at Sardaryab.
Mohammad Umar of Mardan demanded an immediate end to the boating ban and the provision of better recreational facilities for Sardaryab visitors.
He said authorities should develop the area as a premier tourist spot to increase visitor arrivals, which would not only increase their revenues but also create job opportunities for locals. A musical concert was held in the open area at Sardaryab to the amusement of visitors.
Singers sang Pashto poems by Ghani Khan and Hamza Baba.

12,State of healthcare bleak in Haripur,"DHQ hospital lacks doctors, machines; MS insists govt set to release funds","HARIPUR: The state of healthcare, one of the three quantifiable dimensions to measure a district’s development, is bleak in Haripur, though the region was ranked medium high in the UNDP’s Human Development Index Report, 2017.
The report put Haripur on par with Peshawar and Abbottabad with a score of 0.700–0.799 in terms of health, education, and living standards, with their ranking barely a single point short of the high Human Development Index score of 0.800 and above.
In addition to electricity generation and distribution to the national grid from Tarbela and irrigation water storage and distribution to provinces by Haripur, the Hattar Industrial Estate in the district alone contributes Rs80 billion a year in the form of taxes.
“The state of healthcare in Haripur is deplorable; 95 per cent of the cases requiring head and chest surgeries are referred to Abbottabad and other cities,” local Jamaat-i-Islami activist Imran Alizai told Dawn.

He said the PTI had ruled the province since 2013, but the elected MPAs, who also secured cabinet berths, diverted their energies and political acumen towards the construction of roads, buildings, street pavement, and other projects of infrastructural development just to “please their blue-eyed” contractors.
“But they [lawmakers] could hardly focus on upgrading hospitals, equipping them with state-of-the-art treatment facilities and machinery, filling vacancies for specialists, and providing better healthcare to people,” he said.
The political activist said the elected leaders preferred to visit major hospitals in other cities, so they’re oblivious to the problems of a common man.
The district has a population of 1174783 with 2.70pc annual growth rate, but it has just one 210-bed district headquarters hospital for the entire district.
Official figures show that there are no cardiothoracic surgeons or allied facilities for cardiothoracic surgeries; the posts of neurosurgeon, pathologist, and radiologist have been vacant at the hospital for over a decade.
The hospital has over 2000 OPD cases and over 200 emergency ones daily, but it has no MRI and CT scan facilities or a burns unit.
Emergences involving head and chest injuries and burn cases are referred to other hospitals. There is a high incidence of transport-induced deaths, especially in road accidents.
Official sources said there were 39 BHUs, nine RHCs, four type D hospitals each with 40 beds, and 12 community dispensaries.
The building of the Khalabat Township type C hospital has been ready for a couple of years, but due to political wrangling, the required staff has yet to be appointed to it to make it functional.
Sources said in the face of ever-increasing patient burden in the DHQ hospital and a spike of 370 per cent in the rates of hospital consumable items and a 113 per cent increase in the medicines compared to the previous year, the hospital’s budget was revised upward.
For fiscal 2022–23, the hospital’s total budget disbursed was Rs43.5 million but the next year, the government, hit by a financial crunch, released just Rs22 million.
When contacted, medical superintendent of the DHQ Hospital Dr Mohsin Raza Turabi confirmed the trauma centre, a subsidiary of the hospital, had no neuro- and cardiothoracic surgeons to treat head and chest injuries.
He added that the centre had the lowest referral rate in the province, i.e. six per cent.
”Currently, the trauma centre has 12 general medical officers working in three shifts, an emergency medical officer for the evening, two orthosurgeons, and two MOs to handle emergencies,” he said.
The MS said with the operationalisation of the 120-bed Women & Children Hospital, the type C hospital in Khalabat Township, and the type D hospitals, his hospital’s workload would reduce considerably.
He stressed the need for the establishment of a “city hospital or urban dispensary” within the premises of the Women and Children’s Hospital to improve patient care.
About the budget, Dr Turabi said the provincial government was “going” to transfer funds to the hospital after the Eid holidays to improve services.
