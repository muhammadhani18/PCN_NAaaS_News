0,LDA to launch sustainable growth model in three housing schemes,The project is part of a 10-year plan to transform Lahore into livable city.,"LAHORE: The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) is going to introduce a sustainable growth model in three major housing schemes and a couple of Katchi Abadis in a bid to ensure a healthy, environment-friendly and livable atmosphere. 
The proposal was recently shared by the top LDA management in a high-level meeting presided over by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz before Eidul Fitr and she reportedly accepted and appreciated the proposal, giving the LDA a go-ahead to implement the model as early as possible, Dawn has learnt. 
Under the new model, certain major housing schemes and some Karchi Abadis will have dedicated bicycle lanes, solar-powered street lights, designated vending/rehri (pushcarts) points, central recreational areas, pedestrian walkways, rainwater harvesting wells and greenification, improved infrastructure with immediate road repair, lane marking, traffic/street signage and effective enforcement to regulate traffic and other businesses etc. 
The pilot project will be launched at the LDA Avenue-1 Housing Scheme (Raiwind Road) for Rs170m and it will be completed within a period of three months. Johar Town will be the first housing scheme where this model will be introduced formally within a period of six months. The total cost of the project in Johar Town is estimated to be Rs1.7bn. After Johar Town, the same model will be followed in the Allama Iqbal Town where an amount of Rs1.1bn has been estimated to be spent in a period of six months. Gulberg will have this project implemented within a period of one year and an amount of Rs3bn is expected to be spent in the area. In Gulberg, the MM-Alam Road (Gulberg) will also have a separate project within a period of four months with Rs600m.  

The project is part of a 10-year plan to transform Lahore into livable city

Some Katchi Abadis have also been identified where the model would be launched within a period of six months with Rs100m.  
“Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz wants to see Lahore as a unique city in Pakistan in terms of improved environment that can contribute to making the city sustainable and livable where all residents can live a long healthy life,” LDA Director General Tahir Farooq said while talking to Dawn about the project.  
“We have started working under a 10-year visionary plan to transform the entire Lahore into a sustainable and livable city. Our slogan is “Sustainable Development towards a Livable City.” 
The DG said that under a separate plan, titled “Ease of Mobility and Effective Traffic Management,” a survey had been completed and under this plan worth over Rs601m would be spent within a period of six months. According to him, the plan aims at revamping all entry/exit points of Lahore, fixing of hurdles (tyre killers) to stop traffic rules violators, allowing display of signage on designated points, carrying out roads’ patchwork and road designing interventions at 82 locations. 
“We hope that we will be able to make Lahore a sustainable, livable and organised city,” the DG asserted.

1,Air ambulance service to start in June: CM,LAHORE: Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said on Saturday that the first air ambulance service would start in June....,"LAHORE: Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said on Saturday that the first air ambulance service would start in June. 
“First training session for Pakistan/Punjab’s first air ambulance service. The service will be operational in June Insha’Allah,” she wrote in a tweet on X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday. She said the air ambulance project had been completed in a record time. 
The chief minister hinted at getting helicopters for the air ambulance service too besides a plane. Replying to a tweet which suggested that a helicopter would have been better as the plane required a runaway, she wrote, “We are getting helis too. This plane requires a very short landing strip. Also helis can’t fly in bad weather”. 
Earlier, Punjab Minister for Health and Emergency Services Khawaja Salman Rafique said the launch of the air ambulance service marked a significant milestone in the province’s history. He said it was an important project, which would provide swift medical assistance to the people of Punjab. He underscored his department’s commitment to extending services to the motorway, with rescuers stationed strategically at entry and exit points to ensure a rapid response to emergencies.

3,NTDC MD’s hiring struck down,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has struck down the appointment of the managing director of the National Transmission...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has struck down the appointment of the managing director of the National Transmission & Dispatch Company (NTDC) for being made against the law and ordered a fresh process for the selection of the company’s chief strictly in accordance with the State-Owned Enterprises (Governance & Operations) Act 2023.
Justice Shahid Karim issued the directive on Tuesday last (a day before Eid), allowing a petition by Dr Khwaja Riffat Hassan, who was not appointed as MD of the NTDC despite being a principal candidate among three-shortlisted aspirants. 
The petitioner stated that the process for the impugned appointment was set in motion on an advertisement in newspapers seeking applications from well-reputed professionals.
His counsel stated that at the time the process was initiated, the Public Sector Companies (Corporate Governance) Rules, 2013 (2013) Rules) were in place which governed the appointment process of the NTDC MD, a public sector company.
He said the appointment was made by the federal government on Feb 8, 2023, while the State-Owned Enterprises  Governance & Operations) Act 2023 was already enacted on Jan 30.
Therefore, he argued that the appointment of the MD was supposed to be made under the 2023 act and not under the 2013 rules.
Justice Karim agreed with the petitioner’s arguments and observed that it would be a fallacy to hold that despite the commencement of the 2023 act the process under the 2013 rules could continue unimpeded.
“That would be tantamount to reading into section 36 of the 2023 Act words that do not exist,” he maintained.
The judge said the argument that the process had already started before the commencing of the 2023 act does not have any legitimacy.
He ruled that once the 2023 act had been promulgated, the process of the appointment ought to have been put on hold to give effect to the latest legislation by clearly stating that since a new procedure had been laid down and since the process had not attained finality to give way to a fresh process to be initiated.
“Since the appointment of respondent No.5 (Dr Rana Abdul Jabbar Khan) is in contravention, thereof, it must be struck down as without lawful authority and of no legal effect,” Justice Karim declared in the verdict.
The judge made it clear that the appointment for NTDC MD may be initiated by the board of the company in accordance with the provisions of the 2023 act.

5,Five-member JIT to probe Bahawalnagar incident,The JIT will probe into the incident of a police raid on the house of Rana Muhammad Anwar.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government on Saturday constituted a five-member Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to probe the Bahawalnagar incident.
According to notification available with Dawn, Punjab Home Department special secretary was made convener of the JIT, also comprising Bahawalpur Division commissioner, Special Branch Punjab DIG, representative of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB).
The JIT will probe into the incident of a police raid on the house of Rana Muhammad Anwar on April 8 and the subsequent events occurring on April 9 and 10.
The Punjab government and Pakistan Army on Friday pledged transparent investigations into the alleged “face-off” between police and army personnel following the arrest of a serving army official, which took the social media by storm over the Eid holidays.
Four officials of Madressah police, including the station house officer (SHO), have been arrested on charges of keeping a man and his two sons, including an army official, in illegal detention, dereliction of duty and misuse of authority.
Another policeman, the Maroot police SHO, has been suspended from service and a departmental inquiry has been initiated against him for allegedly sharing “misinformation” regarding the matter on social media.
The FIR lodged on the complaint of Inspector Saifullah Hanif with Madressah police on April 10 says that former sub inspector/SHO Rizwan Abbas, ASI Mohammad Naeem, constables Mohammad Abbas and Ali Raza arrested Mohammad Khalil, Mohammad Idrees and their father Mohammad Anwar, who were nominated in an FIR registered on April 8.
Instead of presenting the arrested men before a magistrate, the accused policemen kept them in detention at the police station for more than 24 hours.
According to police sources, the ASI and SHO raided the house of Anwar, a resident of Chak Sarkari, on April 7 for the arrest of his son Rafaqat over possession of an unlicenced pistol.
Meanwhile, Anwar’s son Khaleel, an army official, along with his brother Idrees and others, allegedly took the two policemen hostage. Soon, a video of the police officials being taken hostage was uploaded on social media.
Meanwhile, a police team reached the spot, got the SHO and ASI freed and arrested Anwar and his sons. While making arrests, police not only subjected the family members to severe torture, but also ransacked the house. A video of this episode was also shared on social media.
Later, a case was registered against 23 family members of Mohammad Anwar by the Madressah police under sections 324, 353, 379, 506B, 342, 186, 148, 149 of the PPC and the Punjab Arms Amendment Ordinance 2015.
Sources say that following an inquiry, the Bahawalnagar DPO got a case registered against the SHO, ASI and two constables, getting them arrested by the A Division police.
Two senior police officials, requesting anonymity, told Dawn that the situation turned ugly when 50-60 army personnel from the Bahawalnagar Brigade stormed the A Division police station, and severely tortured the four imprisoned policemen.
As per sources, the injured policemen have been admitted to the Bahawalnagar DHQ Hospital under a heavy security and no one was allowed to meet them.

6,Harking back: ‘Jogi’ hakeem who loved Gobind and challenged mullahs,"Every time I pass by the ‘Lal Khoo’ inside Mochi Gate, the place where Guru Arjan was imprisoned and where ...","Every time I pass by the ‘Lal Khoo’ inside Mochi Gate, the place where Guru Arjan was imprisoned and where Hazrat Mian Mir fed him with ‘barfi’ from the shop opposite, it enrages me to see a local mullah collecting money, allegedly for his mosque.
This mullah has changed the name of the well and the legendary tree to some holy Islamic one, and when Sikh pilgrims come there to tie red ribbons, he removes them and scolds them. Local shopkeepers tell me that the mullah has become a rich person. If anything, this is a major setback to our history. All attempts to stop him are faced by communal threats. Such has become our heritage and our weak and useless establishment.
But then as one thinks of this one is reminded of a somewhat dissimilar person, but then few know about him. In my books he is an outstanding human being. So let me narrate the real-life story of Hakeem Mirza Jogi Allah Yar Khan who lived in Anarkali bazaar and was one of Lahore’s outstanding ‘hakeems’.
Unlike the illiterate mullah of ‘Lal Khoo’, this hakeem was a highly literate person who admired the deeds of the last Sikh guru Gobind and how he sacrificed his four sons to the evils of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. In the end Guru Gobind was killed on the Oct 7, 1708 by the troops of Aurangzeb.
The ancestors of Jogi Allah Yar Khan had migrated from Deccan three centuries earlier, and they were a long time of ‘hakeems’. Allah Yar Khan was born in Lahore in 1870. He was an impressive tall and handsome man who always wore a clean ‘achkan’ and a crispy white shalwar with a well-clipped moustache and a ‘kaskhazi’ beard. His tall black cap made him stand out and a lot of people in the old city believed that he was a god-gifted ‘hakeem.’
But then the ‘yogi’ was very interested in the Shia tradition of ‘Marsyas’ and produced some very fine ones. He followed the traditional processions of mourning for the tragedy of Karbala. As he studied this and other similar tragedies, he came across that of Guru Gobind and the slaughter of his four sons.
The personality of Guru Gobind impressed him, and he studied his career in great detail. The result was that he produced two amazing literary books by titles ‘Shaheedan-e-Wafa’ and the second was ‘Gang-e-Shaheedan’. Among the Sikhs, as well as Lahore’s literary circles, these two books were acknowledged as classics.
But the extremist Muslims priests thought otherwise and declared him a ‘kafir’. His humorous reaction was: “This means I am a true Muslim”. The two books are a poetic description of firstly, the martyrdom of the two younger sons of Guru Gobind, and the other is about the martyrdom of the two elder sons of the guru. So powerful are the verses that pre-Partition Sikhs would read them aloud in processions in the lanes and streets of Lahore and Amritsar on special occasions.  
He would be specially invited to recite his creations at the ‘Jor Melas’ in Nankana Sahib and Chamkaur Sahib and other special places. The mullahs dubbed them ‘Marasiyan da band’ to degrade him and his works. This often led to clashes with the Sikhs of Lahore who defended and admired the works of a Muslim poet and scholar.
But as the works of Hakeem Yogi Allah Yar Khan became more and more popular, with even Allama Iqbal declaring him a genius, the mullah’s of Lahore collectively not only declared him a ‘kafir’ but forced all mosques not to let the yogi enter any mosque.
This stricture lasted for a good 30 years and when the yogi recited the Quran in a most beautify manner they requested people not to listen to the hakeem.
The worse was when a delegation of Lahore mullahs approached a British official to stop him from reciting the Quran. The official retorted: “We understand he is very literate. What better can you wish for!” So that was a let down for the mullahs opposed to a scholar writing about Guru Gobind. The reaction to this was that Sikhs all over the Punjab were provided the two classic works of Hakeem Yogi Allah Yar Khan.
Once Pakistan was created in 1947 he was 77 years old, and the Sikhs of Lahore left because of Partition. This provided the ‘mullahs’ of Lahore with an opportunity to come down on the ‘yogi’ hakeem. They approached him and ‘requested’ – if demanded is not a better word – to seek forgiveness and recite the ‘Kalima’ in their presence.
His response was amazing. He said: “Firstly, there are no mullahs in Islam. Secondly, to question the belief of a Muslim is a cardinal sin. Thirdly, if you expect me to seek forgiveness for telling the truth, well that will never happen. Guru Gobind was a great freedom fighter against foreign forces, this has nothing to do with religion. The shocked mullahs threatened him, to which he said: “You tell me any verse to recite from the Quran and I will recite it. But then you must recite any verse I request”. The mullahs backed off.
To this they said that why do you want to die a ‘kafir’ and not a Muslim. He retorted: “I am Muhammad’s (pbuh) kafir who insists on telling the truth. I can clearly see Guru Gobind in Heaven”. The mullahs left.
Hakeem Mirza Jogi Allah Yar Khan died in Lahore in 1956 at the age of 86. Just where he was buried I have not been able to find out. An effort is needed to find his grave, so that sensible people can lay rose flower petals to honour one of the Lahore’s great, yet little know, poet and scholar.
Last Tuesday, a large group of scholars of Amritsar collected at the Golden Temple to put up a portrait of Lahore’s great poet. Among Sikhs he is honoured like few are. Let me end this piece with a verse from his works:
Dandak main phir Ram to Sita bagal mein;
Sach ketha hoon Gobind ka rutba hi digar ha.
(When Ram was exiled, Sita was always with him.
I swear the status of Gobind remains unique.)

9,Chattha’s son in Wazirabad by-poll contest,Close contest expected between PTI-SIC and PML-N candidates,"GUJRAT: Former district Nazim of Gujranwala, Fayyaz Chattha, the son of veteran politician Hamid Nasir Chattha, is contesting the by-election in PP-36, Wazirabad.  
The elder son of the veteran politician has entered the parliamentary politics for the first time as he was previously elected district Nazim twice in 2001 and 2005.  
Mr Chattha is a PTI-backed candidate but he is contesting the by-poll from the platform of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) as per the policy of his party.

The by-election is scheduled for April 21 and candidates have geared up electioneering following the Eid respite.  

Close contest expected between PTI-SIC and PML-N candidates

The PML-N has once again relied on its previous candidate in the Feb 8 election and awarded the ticket to Adnan Afzal Chattha.  
Former MPA and Gujranwala district president of the PPP, Ijaz Samman, told Dawn PPP candidate Tahir Iqbal Cheema had withdrawn his nomination papers in favour of the PML-N candidate for the by-poll as per directions of the senior party leadership.  
At least 13 candidates are in the run for the by-election, including Baseerat Ali Mujahid of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), Sikandar Nawaz of Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and some independents; however, main contest is expected between the PTI-SIC alliance and PML N.

11,Shortage of biomedical engineers plunges teaching hospital into crisis,DERA GHAZI KAHN: The shortage of biomedical engineers has plunged Allama Iqbal Teaching Hospital of Ghazi Medical...,"DERA GHAZI KAHN: The shortage of biomedical engineers has plunged Allama Iqbal Teaching Hospital of Ghazi Medical College into turmoil, with vital medical equipment like CT scans and X-ray machines remaining dysfunctional and in storage.
The dire situation not only affects local patients but also those from Balochistan, as the hospital serves as a primary medical facility for them.
Dawn learned that the hospital’s crisis stems from problematic standard operating procedures, which prevent local equipment repairs and necessitate sending them outside the district, causing unnecessary delays.
Doctors at the hospital demanded that the authorization of local repairs be allowed to the hospital authorities to mitigate this issue, as patients are currently compelled to seek X-rays and CT scans from private facilities.
Moreover, the persistent shortage of essential medicines, including insulin for diabetic patients, persists due to low budget allocations.
Furthermore, six mobile X-ray machines and the CT scan equipment are dysfunctional, exacerbating patient suffering. Additionally, a scarcity of X-ray and CT scan films intensifies challenges for medical staff and patients alike.
The root cause of the problem lies in the prolonged vacancy of four biomedical engineering positions, depriving the hospital of the expertise needed to maintain and repair medical equipment.
Medical Superintendent Dr Saima Batul said that budget releases every three months, rather than annually, hindering bulk medicine purchases. She said that once the drug testing laboratory completes its work, procured medicines will be available at the hospital. 
She added that official letters have been dispatched to authorities for the appointment of biomedical engineers.

Mostly farmers don’t know how to use the app while the small landholders allege that once again the government introduced this policy for middle man and traders who directly contact food officials. Farmers say they are surprised to learn that the Punjab government has introduced Bardana app for purchasing wheat.  
They say last year the government had issued gunny bags through bank after paying the cost but this time the use of app is a difficult task for them. They have appealed to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to change the policy for them and use easy ways.  
Deputy Commissioner Mian Usman Ali in a press release issued on Saturday said all centres would purchase wheat as per their requirement. 
The Bardana app introduced by the Punjab Information Technology Board will receive applications for gunny bags from April 13 to 17 and food department has set up eight wheat procurement centres in Muzaffargarh district and nine in Kot Addu district.  
The DC said after verification by PITB and Punjab Land Record Authority, a confirmation message would be sent to the farmers who would be informed through the app about the date of release of gunny bags and wheat collection. Gunny bags would be released from April 19 on a first come, first served basis. As per District Food Controller Raheel Ashraf, wheat procurement would start from April 22 (Monday).  
Raheel Ashraf said all arrangements are complete for procurement of the staple at the district level. He said the commodity would be purchased from farmers at a fixed price of Rs3,900 per 40 kg and delivery charges of Rs30 per 100 kg would be paid to each farmer.
