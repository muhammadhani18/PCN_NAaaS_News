0,Private sector borrowing slips 37pc in July-March,Analysts said the high cost of doing business restricted the private sector from borrowing expensive money.,"KARACHI: Amid an uncertain economic outlook with high downside risks, the private sector’s participation in economic growth remains unnoticeable as it is not borrowing from banks for business expansion. 
However, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in its latest report sees Pakistan’s economy expanding at 1.9 per cent in FY24 driven by a rebound in investments by the private sector linked to progress on reform measures.
The ADB’s report surprised many analysts keenly watching the slowing economy, which contracted by 0.2pc in FY23.
The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) latest data showed that the private sector borrowing dropped 36.95pc to just Rs191.5 billion in the first nine months of FY24, compared to Rs299bn in the same period last year when the GDP growth was negative. However, the ADB believes the private sector rebounded this year. The SBP data portrays a different picture.
“The multilateral lenders are satisfied with the reforms they propose. The outcome of these reforms has many negative consequences for trade and industry,” said Amir Aziz, a manufacturer and exporter of textile finished products.
“If the interest rate remains at an unprecedented 22pc and inflation is above 27pc, where is any space for the private sector to enter and play a role in the growth of the economy?” he asked, adding that we have been witnessing electricity prices go up each month while the gas tariff has crossed all limits.
Bank profits doubled in CY23 thanks to investing in risk-free and high-yielding government papers. They are not restricted from parking their liquidity in government papers, and there is no rule binding them on lending to the private sector.
Some bankers and analysts said the high cost of doing business restricted the private sector from borrowing expensive money. At the same time, banks were reluctant to extend loans to the private sector as default risks increased with interest rates like 22pc.
Analysts say the real estate sector, one of the major contributors to economic growth, has crashed and the construction industry is operating at 20pc of its capacity. 
They said the government’s aggressive borrowings from banks reached Rs4.8 trillion in the first nine months of FY24, and it has to drastically slash the Public Sector Development Programme budget each year to meet the fiscal deficit target.
The private sector observed that political uncertainty remained despite a change of government after the general elections. Instead, they fear more uncertainty if the law and order situation in major cities like Karachi is not controlled.
“Nobody is safe in Karachi, neither in the office nor at home, not even on roads,” said a businessman. Several business people have shifted their families to Dubai or Canada, while many have moved their businesses to Dubai. No businessman wants to be quoted as they feel multiple threats.

1,PBC calls for reform-centric qualitative targets,Says front-loaded IMF tax revenue targets overburden those already contributing more than due.,"KARACHI: Pakistan Business Council (PBC) has said that the International Monetary Fund’s previous programmes have suffered from short-term, front-loaded, mainly quantitative targets to manage the twin deficits without sufficient regard to their long-term qualitative impact on the reform agenda.
“It is time we restore the sanctity of long-term plans and deal with fragmentation and silo-working of various ministries as well as the centre and provinces,” PBC chief executive Ehsan Malik said in a letter to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, who embarked on a journey to Washington to explore the construct of the 24th IMF Programme for Pakistan.
Two glaring examples of short-term quantitative (but not backed by qualitative) targets are tax revenue and tariff-based measures to control the energy circular debt. “A smarter way would be to set targets that result in sustainable progress on the reform agenda instead of relying by default on the easy options of extracting more from those who are already contributing more than their fair share,” he said.
In the absence of the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) capacity and capability to broaden the tax base, front-loaded tax revenue targets have, not surprisingly, led to higher taxes on those already contributing a disproportionate percentage of taxes relative to their representation in the economy. At the same time, wholesale, retail, services, transportation, parts of construction and the undocumented real estate sectors have been left outside the tax net. The formal sector has suffered from the twin effects of higher taxes on business and brain drain of quality talent due to elevated tax on its salaried employees.

Says front-loaded IMF tax revenue targets overburden those already contributing more than due

Ehsan said a more innovative way to measure sustainable progress on taxation would be revenue from new taxpayers coupled with relief provided to the overtaxed sectors to encourage investment, scale and retention of quality talent in the country. The net impact over time would be a sustainable increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio.”
Restructuring the FBR, infusing it with technology and appropriate talent, redesigning the fiscal policy to promote investment and formalisation of the economy will not immediately impact tax revenue. Targets should be phased in line with the capacity to tax in a fair and broad manner. Short-term tax collection targets have not served Pakistan well, he added.
Some of the measures to support equitable taxation, such as removal of double taxation of inter-corporate dividends are often misconstrued as contrary to IMF’s wishes. This is strange as most countries in the world don’t penalise group formation, scale and competitiveness by levying multiple taxation of inter-group dividends. Neither do they penalise success through super tax.
He said the fiscal policy needs to be aligned with the industrial, trade and investment policies and should support the growth of the formal corporate sector, not penalise success. Also, when levying new taxes such as capital value tax and super tax, due consideration should be given to the likelihood of driving local investors abroad. “When local investors move abroad and some surrender their Pakistan nationality, foreign investors are hardly likely to be attracted to invest in Pakistan,” he remarked.
Lastly, he added that the solution to the Rs1.7 trillion of taxes claimed to be pending court decisions is not to deny independent appeal processes. Instead, the FBR should be held accountable for exaggerated tax notices and the harassment, delays and legal costs of its actions.
The short-term tariff-led approach has rendered the productive sector uncompetitive in exports, resulting in negative consequences on the external account. That surely is not the IMF’s objective. Therefore, the PBC chief suggested that the government engage the IMF to move away from the short-term tariff-based approach.
The IMF supports the State Bank of Pakistan in targeting a positive policy rate with reference to headline inflation, which includes food and energy. IMF-imposed energy tariff targets drive headline inflation, which then keeps the policy rate high, forcing the government to borrow more and further impacting inflation.

2,"Govt asked to allow import of used cars, SUVs",Dealers association laments overprotection of local assemblers.,"KARACHI: Used car dealers have urged the government to allow the commercial imports of cars up to 10 years old and SUVs up to 20 years, saying this would help the government earn handsome revenues and enable consumers to buy vehicles at affordable prices.
Recommending different proposals for used vehicle imports, All Pakistan Car Dealers and Importers Association (APCDIA) Chairman Mian Shoaib Ahmed said another way is to allow a restrictive $800 million imports mix per annum of different types of used vehicles through banking channels by reforming import policies and tariff structure.
He said this step would help eliminate the outflow of foreign exchange through the kerb market and promote a documented economy by channelising all transactions through the banking system.
It will also promote tax culture, as all importers would be bound to submit their imports and sales tax to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to ensure transparency.

Dealers association laments overprotection of local assemblers

He said duties and taxes should be levied based on the depreciated invoice value of the imported vehicles. The depreciation allowance per month should be 2pc of the Import Trade Price (ITP) value of the vehicle. It should start from the month and year of the vehicle’s last registration, and a maximum of 60pc should be permissible.
Mr Shoaib said the government would have full control over import data to monitor foreign exchange outflows and tax and duty inflows.
He said the overprotection of local car assemblers had not let them grow, and they relied heavily on heavy government incentives, which did not serve the purpose of providing cheaper vehicles to consumers in the last three decades. 
He added that less protection would compel the local assemblers to introduce new technologies and vehicles and promote localisation of parts to lower their production costs and make high-standard, fuel-efficient vehicles.
He said local assemblers were given numerous incentives and benefits to set up their plants to manufacture vehicles. Instead of localising, the assemblers are still importing most of the costly parts and buying low-value parts from local vendors.
Mr Shoaib said local assemblers spent over $5 billion on parts imports from 2020 to 2023. The Japanese companies invested in plant and machinery brought into Pakistan without paying a single penny of import duty, and the value of plant and machinery, as reported in the assemblers’ accounts, is highly questionable.
Besides repatriating huge profits in the form of dividends, none of the companies adhered to the deletion programme, which includes indigenous production of all the components of cars in Pakistan. The assemblers have also not complied with the condition of technology transfer, and they have been still importing semi- and completely knocked kits for the last five decades, he said, adding that the three main Japanese assemblers have failed to achieve the status of the manufacturer and are unable to export vehicles.

3,"New players eye Pakistan’s growing hybrid, electric vehicles market","BYD teams up with Mega for passenger vehicle market, plans showrooms.","ISLAMABAD: As the auto market continues to grow in Pakistan, new players are setting their sights on introducing hybrid as well as electric vehicles (EVs) in the country, and one of the largest automakers has announced its entry into Pakistan.
The BYD Group of China has recently announced its entry into the passenger vehicle market in Pakistan in collaboration with Mega Conglomerate Pvt Ltd, the parent company of Hub Power and Haleeb Foods.
During a signing ceremony recently held in China, Aly Khan, executive director of Mega, highlighted plans to promote EV adoption in Pakistan.”
He stated that three BYD showrooms would be established in Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad in 2024. The move is expected to accelerate the electrification of Pakistan’s automotive industry, which has largely been based on petroleum fuel.

BYD teams up with Mega for passenger vehicle market, plans showrooms

Meanwhile, a senior official of the Ministry of Industries and Production said that BYD and Mega have not applied for the licence to establish an assembly plant in Pakistan. It is more likely that the company and the local partner would import the vehicles into Pakistan, as other EVs, including some European brands, are being sold in the country.
There are several models of EVs and hybrid electric cars in the country, but currently, only the Indus Motor Company is manufacturing a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) — the Toyota Corolla Cross, while two new entrants are assembling hybrid vehicles.
Ali Asghar Jamali, chief executive officer of Indus Motor Company, said that the auto sector was transforming towards reducing dependency on fossil fuels, which was especially important in countries where petroleum fuel was imported.
However, Mr Jamali added that, considering Pakistan’s current energy landscape, there are challenges in introducing battery electric vehicles (BEVs), as there is heavy reliance on petroleum fuel, which hinders the immediate adoption of BEVs.
“The HEV technology presents a practical and efficient solution in the current scenario, as electricity and electric chargers are not available everywhere,” he added.
Possibly due to these infrastructure hurdles, mostly related to the lack of charging ports and continuous availability of electricity, the National Electric Vehicle policy introduced in November 2019 has failed to attract any single four-wheeler EV assembler in the country.
Responding to the query, Asim Ayaz of Engineering Development Board, an attached department of the Ministry of Industries and Production, said that 34 licences have been obtained by two and three-wheeler manufacturers.
He acknowledged that issues related to the launch of EV vehicles in the country, such as the lack of financing for customers as EVs are more expensive due to the higher cost of batteries, but added that the ministry is proposing to have an EV charging station at every gas station to enhance the availability of charging options.
Two local players, Haval of Sazgar Engineering Works Ltd, and Hyundai Nishat Motors, are already assembling hybrid vehicles, while the third local player is also set to enter the non-conventional vehicle market of Pakistan on a larger scale.
Since they have the grace period up to June 2026 under the Greenfield option, these companies were only assembling vehicles in the country. 
Apart from cars, Sazgar is a key player in manufacturing electric auto rickshaws in the country, and in late 2022, Haval introduced Pakistan’s first locally assembled hybrid electric vehicle. Later in October 2023, Hyundai Nishat introduced its hybrid car.
On the other hand, MG Pakistan has decided to enter the market on a larger scale with all three categories of the new energy vehicle (NEV) class. 
These include hybrid vehicles that have inbuilt charging, the other category is the plug-in charging where the vehicles operate on fossil fuel and have the option for plug-in charging too in case of fuel shortage, and the third category is the electric vehicle.
“We have plans to start assembling vehicles in all three NEV categories, and these will be launched in the fiscal year starting from July 2024,” said Syed Asif Ahmed, general manager marketing, MG.

4,Special Economic Zones investors urge govt to resolve tax issues,Enterprises set up in SEZs enjoyed a decade-long exemption from all income taxes as per the SEZ Act 2016.,"ISLAMABAD: Special Economic Zones (SEZs) investors have again urged the government to address anomalies in two crucial tax-related issues to stimulate investment in these designated zones.
In a letter to the Ministry of Finance, the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) highlighted that the minimum turnover tax and the 25 per cent dividend tax were the points of contention.
Initially, under Section 113 of the Income Tax Ordinance, enterprises set up in SEZs enjoyed a decade-long exemption from all income taxes as per the SEZ Act 2016. 
Pakistan has three SEZs: one in Faisalabad and two in Karachi.
A similar letter has been written to the prime minister by the investors of SEZs in Karachi.
It added that the subsequent removal of this exemption, sans consultation with current and potential SEZ investors, has ushered in an atmosphere of uncertainty. 
The ambiguity surrounding the application of turnover tax on such enterprises has led the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to presume its imposition, resulting in the issuance of tax demands against these entities.
This regulatory maze significantly deters foreign and local investments, casting doubt on the government’s commitment to providing a conducive business environment in SEZs. 
Projects within SEZs, characterised by significant capital investments and modest profit margins, are burdened by the spectre of turnover tax, which eclipses the benefits of other tax exemptions.
In response, recommendations have surfaced, advocating for the reinstatement of turnover tax exemption for SEZ enterprises, either through legislative amendments or the issuance of official circulars by the FBR.

5,Educated and unemployed: India’s angry young voters,29pc of university graduates were without jobs in 2022.,"MUMBAI: At a run-down job centre in the suburbs of India’s financial capital Mumbai, 27-year-old Mahesh Bhopale dreams of a well-paid government post — just like millions of other young, unemployed graduates.
As the world’s most populous nation readies for general elections that begin April 19, politicians face a sobering reality. India is the fastest-growing major economy, but there are still not enough white-collar jobs for its educated youth.
“Our only way out of this life is to get a government job and get good benefits,” said biology graduate Bhopale. “That will help us get married and start a family.” He has eked out a living in part-time jobs ranging from a tailor’s assistant to a nighttime security guard while cramming for gruelling civil service examinations.
Coming from a farming village to the big city seeking work, Bhopale said he lacked the contacts to push his application in the private sector.

29pc of university graduates were without jobs in 2022

“A government job is the best kind of job,” he said. “Educated people from villages like us can’t get high-paying private sector jobs.” He isn’t alone. 
The International Labour Organisation estimates 29 per cent of India’s young university graduates were unemployed in 2022.
That rate is nearly nine times higher than for those without a diploma, who typically find work in low-paid service or construction jobs.
‘Demographically expanding’
Over half of India’s 1.4 billion people are aged under 30, according to government health figures.
“Jobs are not rising as fast as the potential workforce is demographically expanding,” said development economist R. Ramakumar, from Mumbai’s Tata Institute of Social Sciences, noting many of the new jobs being created are in farming.
“That is one reason you see a large number of applicants for a small number of positions in government jobs,” Ramakumar said.
It also explains the “urge of people to go out of India through illegal channels”, seeking jobs in the United States or Canada, he added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is widely expected to win a third term in the upcoming elections, points to his success in convincing global tech giants like Apple and Dell to set up in India.
But critics say this has not translated into the millions of manufacturing jobs that people demand.
The World Bank warned this month that India — like other South Asian nations — was “not creating enough jobs to keep pace with its rapidly increasing working-age population”.
Franziska Ohnsorge, the bank’s regional chief economist, said South Asia is failing “to fully capitalise on its demographic dividend,” calling it a “missed opportunity.”
Many young Indians say they have no choice but to join the frenetic race for government jobs, prized for their decent pay, benefits and security.
Competition is intense.
State-run Indian Railways, for instance, receives millions of applications for hundreds of thousands of mid or low-level jobs.
Ganesh Gore, 34, said he had tried and failed the civil service exam five times.
“No party or politician helps us out,” said Gore. “They are sitting there to eat money.” In 2022, after the government switched some permanent military jobs to temporary contracts, violent protests erupted, with people setting railway trains on fire. Riskier jobs also find many takers.
Earlier this year, thousands queued to submit applications for jobs in Israel after labour shortages sparked by the Israeli war against Gaza.
India overtook Britain in 2022 to become the world’s fifth-largest economy, and grew at a robust 8.4pc in the October-December quarter, helped by a surging manufacturing sector.
But many young people say they are frustrated by a lack of opportunities.
In December 2023, protestors hurled smoke canisters into parliament while shouting anti-government slogans to highlight unemployment.
