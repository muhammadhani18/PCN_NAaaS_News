0,PTI boycotts Senate polls in Sindh,Haleem Adil Sheikh announced to launch a protest movement in the coming days,"The PTI has announced its boycott of the upcoming Senate polls in Sindh in protest against alleged rigging in the February 8 general elections. The party has also unveiled plans to stage a massive rally in Karachi on April 28.
Addressing a press conference in Sindh’s provincial capital, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh said the party would not participate in elections held in an assembly formed through rigged elections.
Sheikh also claimed that during by-elections in Sindh, PTI candidates were abducted in an attempt to prevent them from participating in the election race.
According to the PTI leader, a returning officer (RO) rejected the nomination papers of the PTI candidate who wanted to contest a by-election at NA-207 seat in Shaheed Benazirabad against PPP’s candidate Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari.
“Our candidate was later abducted when he was going to the election tribunal to challenge the RO’s decision,” he said, adding that if Aseefa—the youngest daughter of PPP’s slain chairperson Benazir Bhutto—were truly an image of her mother, she would win the election after contesting it.
On March 29, Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari was elected unopposed as a Member National Assembly (MNA) after all opposing candidates withdrew their nomination papers. Aseefa clinched the NA-207 Shaheed Benazirabad-I seat, which had been vacant following her father Asif Ali Zardari’s election as president.
Haleem Adil Sheikh said the PTI had won on February 8 but was defeated through rigging on February 9. “We don’t want to be part of this corrupt system. Our candidate will not participate in the Senate polls from Sindh now,” he said.
He announced that his party would not allow other parties, particularly the PPP, to enjoy a rule based on a stolen election and would launch a protest movement in the coming days. “On April 28, we will hold a public rally in Karachi. We will not strike a deal with this illegal government,” he added.

1,Govt surpasses Rs6.7tr tax target,Nine-month feat achieved on back of direct ones,"The government has exceeded its nine-month tax collection target of over Rs6.7 trillion for this fiscal year on the back of sustained growth of income taxes, reducing the country’s reliance on regressive and inflationary indirect taxation.
Where the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) achieved its target for the period of July-March of the current fiscal year, it also substantially increased the share of the income taxes to nearly half of the total money it racked up.
The FBR further managed to achieve the monthly target of Rs879 billion for the first time in the past two months.
For March, the government had set the tax target at Rs879 billion while the nine-month (July-March) goal was Rs6.707 trillion.
According to provisional figures, the FBR collected Rs6.71 trillion during the nine months of this fiscal year.
The collection was 30% or Rs1.55 trillion more than the amount accrued during the same period of the last fiscal year.
The FBR’s decision to attach the bank accounts of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to recover taxes worth Rs12.7 billion helped it in crossing the nine-month threshold.
On Friday, The Express Tribune reported that the country had granted Rs50 billion in annual income tax exemption to two government departments in violation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and its own taxation law.
However, the FBR did not accept the exemption and went ahead with its plan to recover the amount.
Pakistan has agreed with the IMF that it would not grant any income tax exemption.
The government may have to amend its laws to withdraw the income tax exemption given to the CAA and Pakistan Airports Authority.
Pakistan is gradually heading towards achieving economic stabilisation but it needs intensive efforts to deepen this steadiness by undertaking critical taxation, expenditure and external sector reforms.
The wholesale, retail, construction and agricultural sectors remain the weakest areas in terms of tax collection.
The IMF is expected to bring these areas on the radar in the next bailout programme as there is a resistance to impose any further taxes on the salaried class and corporate sector.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also instructed the FBR not to withhold tax refunds to inflate the revenues.
This led to a significant increase in the payment of refunds by the FBR in March.
The FBR gave Rs369 billion in tax refunds in nine months -- 45% more than the amount during the corresponding period in the last fiscal year.
In March alone, the FBR released refunds of Rs67 billion against just Rs21 billion in the same month last year.
The FBR collected Rs3.27 trillion under the head of income tax in the nine months, exceeding the target by Rs568 billion.
The growth in income tax was 41% over the same period in the last fiscal year.
The share of the income tax in the overall taxation is now nearly 50%, marking a shift in the policy of dependency on indirect taxes.
A key factor behind the higher collection of income taxes is greater collection from the banks.
The banks’ profitability has increased because of the record interest rate at 22%.
The FBR collected Rs2.24 trillion in sales taxes -- higher by Rs335 billion or 18% against the same period of the last fiscal year.
However, the growth is far lower than the prevailing inflation rate, indicating leakages in the collection.
The FBR missed the sales tax target by a wide margin of Rs393 billion and it needs to focus on strengthening its capacity in this area.
The government has launched various initiatives to capture the true sales of businesses but all those measures have failed to yield the desired results.
The federal excise duty (FED) collection amounted to Rs402 billion --higher by 62% over the same period of the last fiscal year. However, the FBR missed the nine-month target by Rs19 billion.
One of the main factors behind the increased collection is the higher FED rates, particularly being charged on tobacco and cement.
The FBR again missed the custom duties collection target by a margin of Rs153 billion.
It collected Rs809 billion in the nine months, which was 16% more against the corresponding period last year.
The custom duties tax target was set on the basis of monthly $5 billion imports.
However, the imports remained on an average at around $4.5 billion because of the external sector problems and slowing wheel of the economy.

2,SC takes suo motu after Jillani nixes panel,Former CJ recused himself from heading inquiry commission on judges’ letter,"In a quick turn of events, the Supreme Court on Monday took suo motu notice of a letter written by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges, alleging interference by the country’s intelligence apparatus in judicial affairs.
The move came after former chief justice of Pakistan Tassaduq Hussain Jillani recused himself from heading a one-man inquiry commission formed by the government to investigate the claims.
The situation unfolded after a group of lawyers and civil society members on Sunday urged the top court to initiate suo motu proceedings on the matter, as it rejected the ‘powerless’ one-man commission.
Through a letter, they urged the top court to take “cognisance of the matter in its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution as this issue eminently relates to public interest and to the enforcement of fundamental rights”.
In a startling letter written to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) members, the IHC judges had accused the country’s intelligence apparatus of pressurizing judges through abduction and torture of their relatives and secret surveillance inside their homes.
The letter, addressed to Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Supreme Court Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Munib Akhtar and chief justices of the IHC and the Peshawar High Court, also questioned if there exists a state police to “intimidate” and coerce judges.
The letter, dated March 25, was signed by Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz of the IHC.
According to the roster issued on Monday, the bench will comprise Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Yahya Afridi, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Musarrat Hilali and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan. The case will be taken up on Wednesday (April 3) at 11:30am.
Read Legacy looms over inquiry: Can former CJ do justice?
It is learnt that being chairman of the committee, the chief justice suggested taking the suo motu notice which was endorsed by committee members Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar.
Earlier in his letter sent to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif dated April 1, the former chief justice said, ""Since the letter is addressed to the members of the Supreme Judicial Council and its chairman, the chief justice of Pakistan, it would be violative of judicial propriety for me to inquire into a matter which may fall within the jurisdiction of a constitutional body which is the Supreme Judicial Council or the Supreme Court of Pakistan itself.""
Thanking the premier and the cabinet for reposing confidence in him to head the commission, the retired judge stated the terms of the reference for the inquiry are not ""strictly"" relevant to the subject under consideration.
Justice (retd) Jillani further added that the request made in the letter is for an ""institutional consultation"", with the terms of the mechanism suggested in the letter. He further added that the letter may not strictly fall within the parameters of Article 209 of the Constitution.
""For the afore-referred reasons, I recuse myself to head the commission and proceed with the inquiry.
Under the Terms of Reference (ToR) of the commission formed by the government, the inquiry commission will fully probe the allegations levelled by the IHC judges and decide whether these are true or otherwise.
It will investigate whether any personnel (of intelligence agencies) are directly responsible for interfering in judicial matters.
“The inquiry commission under its findings will recommend action against anyone from the intelligence agency, department, or government if found involved in such issue. It could, if found necessary during the course of its proceedings, probe other related issues as well.”

3,PM assures foolproof security for Chinese nationals,Shehbaz says March 26 culprits to get exemplary punishment,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday assured foolproof security measures for the Chinese nationals working on the Dasu hydropower project as well as across the country and resolved to ensure exemplary punishment for the perpetrators of the March 26 Bisham incident.
Addressing a gathering of the Chinese nationals working on the power project, he said the government would ensure that the perpetrators and culprits of the March 26 incident should get the exemplary punishment, so that it would be a lesson and that no one could commit such dastardly act in the future.
The prime minister said that the sole purpose of his visit was to offer deep and sincere condolences and express feelings to the Chinese brothers and sisters in Dasu over a sad incident that took place on March 26 in which five Chinese and one local lost their lives.
He said it was a cowardly act on the part of the terrorists to kill innocent Chinese and a Pakistani for no other reason except to disturb and damage the exceptional friendship between Pakistan and China.

Terming it a job of the enemies of Pakistan, the prime minister said that it was a dastardly act on part of the perpetrators who found every opportunity to harm this friendship which was strengthening by each passing day and expanding and moving forward with speed. “That is the reason enemies do not spare any opportunity to damage and create a wedge between the two Iron Brothers.”
The prime minister said that they shared the moment of sadness and sorrow and assured that the government would not leave any stone unturned and would not spare any opportunity to ensure the best possible security measures for the Chinese families and nationals.
He also assured the Chinese leadership, the people and the Chinese ambassador that all foolproof security arrangements would be made for the Chinese people working and supporting a prosperous and developing Pakistan.
The prime minister said that after the incident, he had visited embassy immediately to offer condolences on behalf of his government and the people of Pakistan to the Chinese leadership and the Chinese people.

He informed that a joint investigation team was also constituted on the same day and its report was due any time. He further assured that they would not waste time to act upon the recommendations of the inquiry committee in letter and spirit.
Besides, a high-level security meeting was held on March 27 in which they discussed better coordination with the provincial governments over the additional security measures, he added.
The prime minister said that Pak-China friendship would march forward in unison and the enemies of CPEC and this exceptional relationship would be defeated completely.

The gathering also observed 30-second silence for those who lost lives in the tragic incident.

4,"Imran, wife get reprieve in gifts case",IHC suspends couple’s sentence in Toshakhana reference; orders authorities to allow them once a week,"In an interesting turn of events, the capital’s high court on Monday suspended the 14-year imprisonment of former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, in the Toshakhana case on Monday.
The court is set to hear the couple’s appeal against their conviction in the case after Eidul Fitr.
On January 31, just a week before the February 8 general elections, Islamabad Accountability Court-1 Judge Muhammad Bashir found Imran and his spouse guilty of misusing the state's gift repository and sentenced them to 14 years in prison.
The court also imposed a fine of Rs787 million each on the accused individuals in what was described as the most swiftly concluded trial in the history of accountability courts.
Imran and his wife challenged the trial court’s order in the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
A division bench comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb heard their appeals against the accountability court’s verdict as well as petitions for suspension of their sentences on Monday.
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq noted that the court is currently hearing Imran Khan’s appeal against his conviction in the diplomatic cipher case and therefore cannot hear arguments against his conviction in the Toshakhana case at present.
“The arguments in the cipher case will conclude in two-three hearings. We will take up this case after concluding the cipher case,” he stated.
The couple’s lawyer, Barrister Ali Zafar, contended that this was a separate case and requested the bench to hear preliminary arguments against Imran and Bushra’s conviction in the Toshakhana case.
The judge clarified that the court could only hear arguments on applications seeking suspension of the sentence at present. Zafar, however, insisted on addressing the convicts’ main appeal rather than arguing for sentence suspension.
When Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb asked the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor Amjad Pervaiz about the suspension of the couple’s sentence, Pervaiz agreed that there was a case for suspension.
""The court may suspend [Imran and Bushra’s] sentence. However, it cannot hear their appeals in the case out-of-turn,” he added.
Read IHC allows Imran to meet Bushra Bibi on Eid
Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb appreciated NAB’s stance and described it as appropriate. The bench subsequently ordered the suspension of the couple’s sentence.
When the counsel for the PTI founder requested the bench to also suspend the couple’s conviction in the case, the bench replied that the court had already issued an order regarding the rare circumstances in which conviction might be suspended. It noted that the PTI had challenged that order in the Supreme Court, which would now decide the matter.
In a separate development, an IHC bench led by Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb directed authorities to allow PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to meet on Eid day as well as once every week.
Imran is currently detained at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail while his wife is confined to Imran’s personal residence at Bani Gala, which was declared a sub-jail after Bushra’s conviction.
The IHC issued this order while hearing Bushra’s appeal seeking her transfer to Adiala Jail.
During the proceedings, the court questioned how authorities could declare a private residence as a sub-jail. It expressed displeasure over the reports submitted by the Islamabad Commissioner and Adiala Jail superintendent enumerating reasons why Bushra should not be transferred to Adiala Jail and allowed to meet her husband.
The court observed that while authorities claim that the jail does not have enough space to accommodate the former first lady, 141 women prisoners have been inducted into the facility since January 31, the day Bushra Bibi was convicted.
The judge pointed out that the argument that the husband and wife meet in court during case proceedings is not valid, as such encounters cannot be considered proper meetings. The court ordered authorities to ensure that the couple meets positively once a week.
The Convictions
NAB's Toshakhana reference alleged that Imran and his wife retained gifts received during their official visits to foreign countries while Imran was prime minister. Instead of following official protocol, they kept the gifts and paid a lesser amount to the treasury.
In another case, a court disqualified Imran Khan on August 5, 2023, and sentenced him to three years in prison for not disclosing gifts he received as prime minister in his statements of assets and liabilities submitted to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
On January 30, a special court convicted Imran and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in a case related to the misuse of a diplomatic cipher during the final days of the PTI government in March 2022, sentencing them to 10 years in prison each under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), 1923.
The couple was also convicted in a case concerning their marriage, which occurred when Bibi’s mandatory Iddat period was not completed.
