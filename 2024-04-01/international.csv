0,Sindh sets up first archive lab,Facility marks a watershed moment to safeguard region's rich cultural heritage,"In a significant milestone for cultural preservation and historical conservation, Sindh has inaugurated it’s first-ever state-of-the-art ‘Scientific Conservation Laboratory.
Situated strategically next to Romi Graveyard on the Northern Bypass, this facility marks a watershed moment in the region's efforts to safeguard its rich cultural heritage.
The laboratory's swift establishment, accomplished within a mere seven months during the tenure of the interim government, underscores the dedication and commitment of authorities to cultural preservation.
Dr Syed Junaid Ali Shah, the interim Sindh minister for culture, sports, labor, and human resources, played a pivotal role in spearheading this initiative.

The laboratory boasts cutting-edge equipment and facilities essential for the meticulous conservation of artifacts. It houses a team of highly trained archaeologists, draftsmen, architects, field officers, technicians, and other specialists, ensuring comprehensive care and preservation of historical treasures.
This infrastructure represents a significant investment in Sindh's cultural landscape. An impressive aspect of the laboratory's development is its reliance on indigenous resources.
Roshan Ali Kanasro, the resident director at the Planning, Development, and Works Sindh, emphasized that the entire structure was designed and constructed using local resources—a testament to Sindh's capabilities and dedication to self-sufficiency in cultural endeavors.

“This structure has also been designed and built by our own resources,” Kanasro said. “This laboratory has capacity to work on paper and antiquities conservation,” Kanasro explained.Prior to the laboratory's establishment, Sindh faced challenges in the conservation of its antiquities. Artifacts were often sent to distant locations such as Lahore or Islamabad for treatment, leading to delays and logistical complications.
With the laboratory now operational, Sindh possesses the capacity to conduct both paper and antiquities conservation locally, streamlining the process and ensuring timely care for its historical treasures.

The meticulous process of artifact conservation undertaken at the laboratory reflects a commitment to scientific principles and best practices. Field officer Amir Memon, engaged in conserving artifacts dating back over 2,300 years, highlights the significance of each object and the need for utmost care in preservation.
The laboratory's trained personnel employ specialized techniques to ensure the longevity and integrity of these priceless relics, contributing to our understanding of Sindh's rich cultural heritage.
“This is a multi-periods archaeological site where remains of Hindu period, Buddhist and pre-Islamic period were found,” he said while indicating various objects under observation.

He said that: “Most of the objects have been dumped for years and thanks to the newly established laboratory that all the artifacts are being conserved scientifically,” he added.
The laboratory serves as a hub for international collaboration, with visiting archaeologists from countries such as Germany, Italy, and France providing valuable insights and expertise. This exchange of knowledge enriches the conservation efforts and fosters global cooperation in safeguarding cultural treasures.
Preserving historical narratives
In addition to artifact conservation, the building undertakes the digitization of field diaries—a crucial step in preserving historical narratives.
Amar Fayaz Buriro, Director of the Abdul Majid Bhurgri Institute of Language Engineering, highlights the significance of these diaries, which offer firsthand accounts of archaeological expeditions dating back to the 1940s and 1950s. By digitizing these invaluable documents, Sindh ensures their accessibility to future generations, facilitating research and exploration into the region's past.
“We have diaries from 1940s, 1950s and older ones.” He said that total 310 written dairies were available and were all scanned. “You can check them online,” Fayaz showed the website, comparing the hard copy of a diary placed at the table. “They carry history, politics, socio-economic conditions, and useful and interesting stories of our region,” he added.
“Today we got up at 5 in the morning and after breakfast we left for the site…” stated in a diary written in 1957.
Showcasing cultural treasures
To showcase the wealth of historical artifacts preserved at the laboratory, plans are underway for an antiquities display hall.
“This public space will allow visitors, including researchers and students, to immerse themselves in Sindh's rich cultural heritage,” Kanasro said. He said that the hall will feature meticulously curated exhibits, offering insights into the region's diverse history and cultural evolution.
A repository of knowledge
Complementing the antiquities display hall, a library will soon be operational, serving as a repository of knowledge on Sindh's cultural heritage. Researchers and enthusiasts alike will have access to a wealth of resources, including scholarly publications, historical texts, and archival materials, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of Sindh's cultural legacy.
“The establishment of the laboratory heralds a new era of cultural preservation and historical conservation in Sindh,” Buriro commented.
Muhammad Shah Bukhari, a former official of the National Museum, said that the laboratory paves the way for the establishment of additional museums across the province, ensuring that Sindh's youth remain connected to their rich historical heritage.
With plans for museums in Sukkur and Kot Deji underway, Sindh is poised to showcase its cultural treasures to the world, reaffirming its status as a custodian of history and heritage.
