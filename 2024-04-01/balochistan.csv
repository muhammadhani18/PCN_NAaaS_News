0,Call to strengthen national security narratives,HEC chairman highlights concerns of youth susceptibility to hostile propaganda,"Amid concerns over the vulnerability of the country’s youth to hostile propaganda of the rivals, Higher Education Commission Chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmed has emphasised the critical role of well-researched narratives on national security to counter such influences.
Dr Mukhtar, while delivering a lecture at the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS), Islamabad, pointed out the necessity of engaging think tanks in the battle against misinformation, advocating for their central role in educating the youth through accurate information dissemination, according to a press release issued by CISS on Friday.
His suggestion underscored the importance of leveraging research, digital literacy and public dialogue to cultivate a generation capable of discerning fact from fiction, thereby fortifying national discourse against adversarial propaganda efforts.
He highlighted the exceptional contributions of Pakistani researchers in fields such as nuclear and missile technology, which have been instrumental in maintaining national security.
Dr Mukhtar further stressed the pressing need for collaboration between universities and think tanks to serve the larger security interests of the country.
By fostering collaboration, enhancing research quality, and leveraging available resources, these collaborative efforts can equip Pakistan’s youth with the knowledge and resilience to resist enemy propaganda and safeguard the country’s interests.
HEC, he offered, can facilitate such collaboration and even provide resources where necessary.
Dr Mukhtar identified the need for enhancing the quality of research in Pakistan, as meticulously crafted research, grounded in solid data and analysis, holds the power to earn respect even from the most formidable adversaries.
Addressing the event, CISS Executive Director Ambassador Ali Sarwar Naqvi said an educated population serves the interest of society and helps strengthen traditional and non-traditional elements of national security.
He further stated that Pakistan is at a very critical point where combining innovative research, good planning, and forward-thinking leadership could help us grow and become more resilient.
CISS Director of Research Dr Atia Ali Kazmi suggested forming a think tank consortium under the aegis of HEC to promote integrated social sciences research and viable policy guidelines for national development.
Heads of other think tanks, academics, and foreign policy experts participated in the event.

2,Advocates press for climate-resilient capital,"Say rapid urbanisation, population boom detrimental to city’s sustainability","Experts at a seminar in Islamabad emphasised the urgent need for the federal capital to develop climate-resilient infrastructure, considering the challenges posed by population growth and climate-related disasters.
The seminar, titled 'Building Urban Climate Resilience in Islamabad,' was jointly organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) and Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA).
CANSA representatives participated in the seminar online.
During the seminar, SDPI Deputy Executive Director Dr Shafqat Munir highlighted the necessity of creating model municipalities with climate-resilient infrastructure. He stressed the importance of a robust local government system in Pakistan to foster climate-smart urban centres and address disasters effectively at the local level. However, financial constraints for local authorities remain a significant hurdle.
Referring to the SDPI Report on the same title, he said in Nepal, a mayor from a small municipality has developed climate-smart infrastructure in his municipality, but in Pakistan, financial constraints for local-level authorities are the main impediments to achieving the goal of urban resilience.
He informed that the SDPI is also engaging with provincial governments to convince them to invest in peri-urban areas and local governments for the sake of climate resilience.
Aleena Kareem emphasised the importance of transparency, better reporting, impact evaluation mechanisms, and public-private partnerships in supporting urban resilience initiatives. She recommended setting net-zero targets for Islamabad to curb carbon emissions and mitigate climate-related disasters.
Nakul from CANSA noted Pakistan's rapid population growth and urbanisation rates, emphasising the need for concerted efforts and mechanisms to address these challenges. He highlighted the vulnerability of South Asian cities to economic development pressures and called for substantial efforts beyond international forums like COP to achieve urban resilience goals.
Zainab Naeem, an Associate Research Fellow at SDPI, presented key findings from the report, emphasizing the link between climate change and urban growth in South Asia. She highlighted the increased health risks in urban areas due to factors like air pollution and extreme heat, as well as the significant investment required for flood protection.
Ashiq Nawaz from the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) raised concerns about Islamabad's transformation into a business hub, straining its infrastructure and services. He highlighted issues such as watercourse pollution, solid waste management challenges, and the need for integrated resource management.
Irfan Niazi, Deputy Director General of CDA's Environment Wing, discussed the Margalla Hill National Park's land categories and the challenges posed by encroachments and population settlements. He underscored the need for effective waste management and land use planning to ensure sustainable urban development.

3,Unpaid teachers call for exam reforms,"Despite diligent efforts, they have been left unpaid for exam duties for three years","Teachers engaged in conducting centralised primary and middle standard exams under the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) have come forward with grievances regarding unpaid remuneration and burdensome expenses incurred during exam duties for the last three years.
Frustrated by unmet promises and financial strain, these teachers advocated for a shift towards local exams to alleviate their plight. Despite assurances from FDE authorities, teachers allege that for the past three years, they have not received their rightful remuneration for conducting exams and assessing papers.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, several female teachers while talking to media lamented the dire situation, highlighting the financial hardships they endure to fulfil their duties. One of the teachers revealed, “FDE conducts centralised exams and teachers have to bear the exams expenses from their pocket which is ridiculous. The expenses include transportation costs to exam centres, purchasing materials for sealing answer scripts, and covering transport expenses to deliver materials to FDE.”
Another teacher recounted, “I hired a taxi, collected the exam material from FDE and deposited answer scripts daily during the exams but FDE never provided transport facility or paid transportation cost. I paid from my pocket. The absence of reimbursement for expenses incurred during exam duties has left me feeling undervalued and disrespected.”
Promises made by FDE officials regarding payment for exam duties remain unfulfilled, she said. “For three consecutive years, the FDE has failed to reimburse teachers for their diligent efforts in administering exams and assessing papers. While appointing teachers for examination duty, teachers are assured of payment but unfortunately, the promise of FDE officers never fulfilled,” shared another teacher.
The situation is compounded by the lack of support from FDE in providing the necessary materials and facilities for conducting exams. Teachers report purchasing materials such as clothes, sealing wax, and packing material with their own money, without any reimbursement from FDE.
Additionally, the absence of paper collection facilities further adds to the logistical challenges faced by the teachers. Despite assurances of payment, teachers lament the recurring excuse of the Accountant General Pakistan Revenue (AGPR) withholding funds, leaving them to shoulder the expenses personally.
In light of these grievances, teachers have proposed the abolition of the centralised exam system in favour of local exams conducted within respective schools. This proposal aims to relieve teachers of the financial burden associated with centralised exams and ensure a more sustainable and equitable system for teachers and institutions.

5,WASA accused of squandering public money,Sources say work of installation of tiles on top of old tiles is being done in a very poor and substandard manner,"The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) is now squandering the national exchequer by fixing new tiles on the already expensive tiles on the filtration plants in the pretence of repairing them across the city.
According to sources, even the work of installation of tiles on top of old tiles is being done in a very poor and substandard manner. The filtration plants in the city are merely symbolic, with 50% of them shut down and the rest failing to deliver clean water to the city. Due to the poor quality of city water, residents are suffering from hepatitis and gastrointestinal diseases. The Citizen Action Committee sent water samples from the Wasa filtration plants to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) laboratory for examination, all of which were found contaminated.
Citizen Action Committee Chairman Malik Zaheer Awan, while talking to the media on the occasion of visiting the filtration plants of Glass Factory Chowk, Zafarul Haq Road, said: “We will file an anti-corruption complaint against sub-standard repairs and renovations of the filtration plants.”
He alleged that the corrupt mafia officers were turning a blind eye to unethical practices by accepting commissions from contractors. “In addition to damaging the national exchequer, the well-being of the citizens is also being compromised,” he said.
“We will get the water from all filtration plants across the city checked by the NIH lab and if the HIV lube cartridge of all the filtration plants machinery is not replaced in time and the water quality is not supplied as per the hygienic norms, we will start a protest movement and also file a writ against Wasa in the High Court,” he added.
Councillor Itehad Chairman Haji Nasir Bhatti, Nasir Awan, Islahuddin Khan and Waheed Rajab Khan were also present on the occasion.

6,Govt-run schools delay annual results in Rawalpindi,Students return disheartened without knowing their scores,"The annual results for classes I to VIII in a majority of government schools in Rawalpindi district faced delays this year due to inadequate planning by the education department.
This delay left many students disheartened as they returned home without knowing their results.
Typically, government school exam results are announced on March 31, unless it falls on a Sunday or an Islamic holiday, in which case the results are released on March 30. However, this year, March 31 coincided with a Sunday, prompting many schools to issue results on March 30.
Despite efforts by some schools to announce results on April 1, several government schools were unable to do so.
The delayed results are now scheduled to be released on Tuesday, April 2. The reason cited for the delay is the exams for Class IX and Matric, which were held on April 1.
According to results announced so far, all government school students passed their exams this year, with no failures reported across any class. While students welcomed the new policy to pass every student, teacher organisations and school councils have raised objections.
The new academic session in government schools, initially set to start on April 1, has been rescheduled to April 3 due to these delays. However, another challenge has emerged with the distribution of free textbooks. Around 60% of students in the district's 1,980 government schools have been deprived of free textbooks due to difficulties in distribution.
This problem stems from a programme that collects old textbooks from passing students to give to new ones, halting the distribution of new books. As a result, only 30-50% of old books have been recovered, leaving many parents with the burden of purchasing new textbooks from the market.
The District Education Authority have yet to address these concerns, leaving schools and students to navigate these challenges independently.

7,SC takes note of vacant VC slots,Declares petition seeking appointment of regular VCs in public varsities admissible,"The Supreme Court (SC) has declared a petition concerning the absence of regular vice-chancellors in public sector universities nationwide as admissible in the public interest.
An association of public university teachers has approached the SC, urging it to issue directions to appoint vice-chancellors at public sector universities per the law and without further delay.
In this regard, a petition was filed by the All Public Universities BPS Teachers Association (APUBTA) in the top court on Tuesday.
In its petition, the APUBTA informed the court that it is an association which represents around 50,000 university professors from across Pakistan.
Earlier, the registrar's office had raised objections about the admissibility of the plea.
In his plea, the petitioner highlighted that over 60 public sector universities lack vice-chancellors, leading to a void in the decision-making process of the institutes.
According to the petitioner, there are no decision-making bodies and academic councils in the respective universities.
Filing its petition under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, the association also urged the top court to consider the vacant seats for vice-chancellors in public-sector universities across the country.
The application, moved through Advocate Umer Ijaz Gillani, listed the President of Pakistan (who is directly or through his governors in each province and the chancellor of public sector universities), the Higher Education Commission (HEC), and the federal and provincial governments as respondents.
In response, the court has requested comprehensive information from all provincial governments regarding this matter. Under the Practice and Procedure Act, a three-member committee holds the authority to decide whether to entertain an application for hearing. The Chief Justice of Pakistan, Qazi Faiz Isa, presided over a three-member bench hearing the case and inquired about the petitioner. Advocate Umar Gilani, representing an organisation of 15 thousand teachers, confirmed filing the petition.
During the proceedings, it was revealed that out of a total of 147 universities, 66 are in the public sector, with many lacking a vice-chancellor. The lawyer attributed this situation to governments' reluctance to appoint permanent vice-chancellors, possibly to exert influence.
The chief justice acknowledged the lack of syndicate meetings for years, expressing concern over this neglect.
Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan noted discrepancies in the information provided, stating that all universities in Balochistan do have permanent vice-chancellors contrary to earlier claims. The court adjourned the hearing indefinitely, emphasising the need for accurate information regarding the appointment of vice-chancellors in public universities across Pakistan.
The abysmal practice has plagued public sector varsities for long in the country already grappling with a myriad of problems.
