• Welcomes initiatives in energy, climate change sectors
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday responded to a letter penned by US President Joe Biden, seeking enduring ties with Pakistan, by saying that Islamabad was willing to engage with Washington for the common goals of regional and global peace.
The letter from the US president came at a time when a newly elec­ted government — led by Shehbaz Sharif — is grappling with economic crisis as well as security challenges on its western border, particularly the cross-border attacks claimed by the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The letter shared with the media by the PM’s Office on Sunday said that Pakistan was willing to work with the US towards “a common goal of global peace and security and development and prosperity of the region”.
PM Shehbaz, who became premier after Feb 8 elections with the help of his allies, termed the relationship with the US of key importance as he welcomed the collaborations with the US administration in several fields, including the energy sector.
The PM said both countries had been working together on various significant initiatives in energy, climate change, agriculture, health and education sectors, welcoming the cooperation in the energy sector and the Green Alliance Framework.
In a recent State Department briefing, spokesperson Matthew Miller had reassured the global community that the US would not allow Afghanistan to re-emerge as a base for terrorism.
“The United States remains vigilant against the evolving threat posed by terrorist groups, including IS-K, and has maintained an unwavering focus on terrorism since President Joe Biden took office three years ago,” Miller said.
The US, he said, was “working both unilaterally and with its partners to successfully disrupt threats across the globe and degrade IS”.
The relationship between Pakistan and the US faced a setback after former PM Imran Khan blamed the US for his ouster from power using a diplomatic cable — cipher — to corroborate his claim. During his term in office, Mr Khan never received any correspondence from the White House.
After Imran Khan’s ouster in a no-trust move, Shehbaz Sharif became the premier in April 2022 but he was not congratulated by Mr Biden upon his election either.
Nonetheless, the letter by Mr Biden on Friday was the first communication between the new government — whose credibility was questioned by a US diplomat during a congressional committee hearing citing irregularities in Feb 8 polls — and the Biden-led US administration.
In the letter sent to the PM on Friday, President Biden assured Islamabad that the US would continue to stand by Pakistan amid the most pressing global and regional challenges.
He termed the enduring partnership between the two nations critical to “ensuring the security of our people and people around the world”.
In the letter, the US president recalled the realms in which Washington is helping Pakistan, such as health security, economic growth, and access to education for all.
The message from the US president arrived over a week after a US diplomat questioned the credibility of the general elections ahead of his appearance at a Congressional panel.
Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu had submitted a written statement expressing Washington’s concerns about irregularities in the Feb 8 elections while also emphasising the need to stay engaged with Pakistan to help it navigate through the crises it was facing.

1,Govt increases petrol price by Rs10 per litre,"High-speed diesel cut by Rs3.32 per litre, LPG down by Rs6.44 per kg","ISLAMABAD: Days before Eidul Fitr, the government on Sunday increased the price of petrol by Rs9.66 per litre and reduced that of high-speed diesel (HSD) rate by Rs3.32 per litre for the next fortnight ending April 15.
In a late-night announcement, the Ministry of Finance said the price of petrol (motor gasoline) had increased in the international market during the last fortnight, while the price of HSD has marginally declined. Therefore, the ministry decided to “revise the existing consumer prices of petroleum products”.
In the latest price review, the petrol price has been increased to Rs289.41 per litre for the next fortnight from Rs279.75, up by 3.45 per cent (Rs9.66). However, the fuel will be available in the retail market for at least Rs290 per litre.
Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.

High-speed diesel cut by Rs3.32 per litre, LPG down by Rs6.44 per kg

On the other hand, the high-speed diesel price has been reduced by Rs3.32 per litre to Rs282.24 for the next 15 days, compared to Rs285.56 over the past fortnight.
Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
The government did not announce the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO). Kerosene is mostly used by unscrupulous elements to mix with petrol and, to some extent, for lighting in very remote areas, while LDO is consumed by flour mills and a couple of power plants.
Officials said the price of petrol had increased by about $4 per barrel to $94.5 per barrel, and its import premium further went up to $13.5 per barrel against $12.15 a fortnight ago because of the geopolitical situation.
The HSD’s price, on the other hand, was down in the international market and its import premium paid by the benchmark Pakistan State Oil (PSO) remained unchanged at $6.50 per barrel.
The exchange rate has also improved to the rupee’s advantage by about Re1 per dollar to Rs278.6 over the fortnight.
At present, the government is charging about Rs82 per litre tax on petrol and HSD.
Although the general sales tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, the government charges Rs60 per litre petroleum development levy (PDL) on both products. The government also charges about Rs19-20 per litre customs duty on petrol and high-speed diesel.
Both fuels are the major revenue spinners, with their monthly sales of about 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene.
The Rs60 per litre PDL on petrol and HSD is the maximum permissible limit under the law.
The government set a budget target to collect Rs869 billion as a levy on petroleum products during the current fiscal year under the commitments made with the IMF.
Meanwhile, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority has reduced the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by 2.5pc or Rs6.44 per kg for April.

2,"Lawyers say yes to ‘suo motu’, no to ‘powerless commission’","Joint letter, signed by over 300 lawyers and over dozen members of civil society, says SC should form bench all with all available judges and proceedings should be telecast live.","ISLAMABAD: A group of lawyers and civil society members urged the Sup­reme Court to initiate suo motu proceedings to investigate the allegations levelled by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges against intelligence officials, as it rejected the ‘powerless’ one-man commission appointed by the federal cabinet to probe these claims.
The top court was asked to take “cognisance of the matter in its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution as this issue eminently relates to public interest and to the enforcement of fundamental rights”.
In a joint letter signed by over 300 lawyers and over a dozen members of civil society, the lawyers said the apex court should form a bench of all available judges to hear the matter and proceedings should be telecast live for public consumption.
It also urged the court to look into the allegations levelled by retired justice Shaukat Siddiqui, besides the recent claims of meddling in judicial affairs.
“It is further imperative that such proceedings are not limited in scope and …that such proceedings affix responsibility for any breach by the executive officials (if proven) and hold those responsible to account to secure the independence of the judiciary and to restore public confidence in the institution of judiciary.”
According to the letter, the entire justice system becomes a sham if judges are coe­rced as claimed by the IHC letter.
“When judges, the last guardians standing between state excesses and the fundamental rights of citizens, are systematically coerced and intimidated, the entire system of justice becomes a sham and loses its credibility. Lawyers seeking justice for litigants before the courts do so with the expectation that they will be heard by neutral, impartial and unbiased arbiters seeking to dispense justice,” it said.
Lawyers’ convention
It urged the Pakistan Bar Cou­ncil and all bar associations to call a convention of lawyers on an “urgent basis” to decide on a collective course of action for the independence of the judiciary.
It endorsed the resolutions passed by the Islamabad High Court Bar Association, the Islamabad Bar Association, the Sindh High Court Bar Association, the Pakistan Bar Council, the KP Bar Council and the Balochistan Bar Council to the extent that they resolve to uphold the principle of independence of judiciary, express solidarity with the six judges of the IHC, commend their courageous action and demand appropriate action.
‘Conflict of interest’
The lawyers questioned the constitution of the commission by the federal government, saying: “Such course evidently detracts from well-established judicial principles requiring proceedings to be held before an impartial, unbiased and independent forum.”
Moreover, the time frame within which such inquiry is to be conclu­ded and whether or not the report of such an inquiry commission will be permitted to be made public is also within the control of the federal government, they pleaded.

4,Situationer: Coalition eyes two-thirds majority in tomorrow’s Senate polls,"If all goes to plan, PPP, PML-N and partners can get 64 senators in 96-member house."," 

Ziauddin

• If all goes to plan, PPP, PML-N and partners can get 64 senators in 96-member house
• PTI would still remain single largest party; polling in KP Assembly may be delayed if MPAs’ oaths issue is not resolved today
TOMORROW’S Senate elections are likely to see parties in the ruling coalition — the PML-N and PPP — move closer to a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament.
The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) will likely maintain its position as the single largest party in the new house, which will emerge after polling on its 30 vacant seats tomorrow (Tuesday), but it will be in no position to hamper the government’s legislative business.
The Senate, which is also known as the House of Federation, will comprise 96 members — 23 each from the four federating units and four from Islamabad. The 23 seats allocated to a province comprise 14 general seats, four reserved for women, four for technocrats and one for minority member.
The term of a senator is six years but 50 per cent of the total number retires after every three years and elections are held for new senators.
Elections to fill the seats allocated to each province are held in accordance with the “system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote”. Therefore, the Senate elections always depend on the party positions in the four provincial assemblies and the National Assembly.
Based on careful calculations, it appears that the ruling coalition needs 64 senators in the 96-member Senate to cement its position.
Initially, polling was to be held to elect 48 senators — 11 each from KP and Balochistan, 12 each from Punjab and Sindh and two from Islamabad.
But following the unopposed election of 18 senators from Punjab and Balochistan, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) will be holding elections on 30 vacant seats, for which 59 candidates are in the run.
Numbers game
Statistics reveal that the PTI currently has 20 members in the Senate, including those elected unopposed recently, and is in a comfortable position to clinch at least seven more seats from its stronghold of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, thus becoming the single largest party in the Senate with 27 senators.
 
 

If all MNAs and MPAs vote strictly in accordance with their party policy, the PPP is expected to face no problem in winning 10 to 11 seats from Sindh and one each from KP and Islamabad.
At present, the PPP has 13 senators and after winning 12 to 13 seats in the elections, the PPP can become the second largest party in the Senate with 25 to 26 members in the new Senate.
The PML-N also has 13 senators presently, and is expected to win another seven seats — five from Punjab and one each from KP and Islamabad — in the upcoming elections, which would make it the third largest party in the House.
It is interesting to note that the Jamaat-i-Islami, Pashtunkhwa Mili Awami Party and the PML- Functional are going to lose their representation in the Senate as all of their members retired in March.
In view of the prevailing numbers in the assemblies, these parties have not even fielded candidates.
Here are the possible scenarios that could play out in the various legislatures, where polling will be held tomorrow (Tuesday) betw­een 9am and 4pm.
Punjab Assembly
Following a reported behind-the-scenes understanding among the country’s three major parties — the PML-N, PPP and PTI — all seven candidates vying for the upper house of parliament on general seats from the province have already been elected unopposed.
Four of those elected unopposed belong to the ruling PML-N, while two hail from PTI-Sunni Ittehad Council alliance.
Three candidates will now contest for two technocrat seats after the withdrawal of papers by Mustafa Ramday.
The contest will feature Finance Minister Moham­mad Aura­ngzeb and Mus­adik Malik of PML-N and PTI’s Dr Yasmin Rashid.
PPP’s Faiza Ahmed, Anusha Rahman, PML-N’s Bushra Anjum and PTI’s Sanam Javed are in the race for the two women’s seats, while Khalil Tahir of PML-N and Asif Ashiq of PTI are vying for the minority seat.
If the ruling coalition remains united in Punjab and is able to get its members to vote under a joint strategy, then PML-N candidates would be in a position to win all five seats from the province.
Here, although PPP’s Faiza Ahmed is contesting for a women’s seat, she is unlikely to secure it without an understanding with the PML-N.
The PML-N also enjoys the support of Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP), the PML-Q, the PML-Z and some other smaller groups.
On the other hand, the PPP only has 14 MPAs in the 371-member Punjab Assembly, where 16 seats are lying vacant for various reasons. But given that the number of PTI-backed independents in the Punjab Assembly is 91 and, therefore, the PTI-SIC alliance has a very remote possibility of winning any seat.
Sindh Assembly
Presently, 11 candidates are vying for seven general seats from Sindh. In addition, there are three candidates in the run for two seats reserved for women, four on two seats reserved for technocrats/ulema and two hopefuls for the only seat reserved for minorities.
The situation in Sindh will be interesting where Faisal Vawda — said to be enjoying the support of the powers that be — has also filed nomination papers as an independent candidate.
In view of its clear dominance in the provincial legislature, if the PPP decides to vote for Mr Vawda, it can get at least five out of seven general seats, while the MQM-P will get one seat as well.
The PPP, however, is set to win all the other five seats from the province — two each for women and technocrats and one for minorities — if everything goes smoothly.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
The most interesting contest is expected in the PTI-ruled KP, where the MPAs will be voting to elect 11 senators, including seven on the general seats.
The ECP has already declared that it would be compelled to postpone elections to the extent of KP if the speaker fails to administer the oath to members of the assembly elected against reserved seats.
If this happens, the KP Assembly may not witness any voting on Tuesday, which would mean that at least seven would-be senators from PTI would have to wait longer to become members of parliament.
According to the final list of the candidates, there are 16 candidates vying for seven general seats from the province.
Other candidates on the general seats from KP are Attaul Haq of the JUI-F and Niaz Ahmed of the PML-N, besides 13 independents, mostly those nominated by the PTI.
Prominent among them are Azam Swati, Faisal Javed Khan, Murad Saeed, former Senate deputy chairman Mirza Muhammad Afridi, Noorul Haq Qadri, Khurram Zeeshan, Azhar Mashwani and Dilawar Khan.
The ruling PTI has 91 MPAs in the 145-member provincial assembly and, therefore, it is all set to win at least seven seats — five general and one each reserved for women and technocrats — from the province.
Islamabad
Farzand Hussain Shah of the PTI and Rana Mehmoodul Hassan of the PPP are the candidates for the general seat from the capita whereas Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar of the PML-N and Raja Ansar Mehmood of the PTI are vying for the technocrat seat.
Polling for the federal capital’s seats will be held in the National Assembly.
