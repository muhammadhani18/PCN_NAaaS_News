1,Modern warfare tactics escalating terror threat in K-P,"The provincial police force is ill-equipped to ward off terrorists who have snipers, thermal technology","In the wake of the United States withdrawal from Afghanistan, security challenges in Pakistan have exacerbated, as evidenced by the recent surge in attacks in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P). 
However, what is perhaps more alarming is the fact that perpetrators are employing sophisticated weaponry and thermal technology left behind by the United States’ forces. This is evidenced by an incident which took place earlier in March, in Peshawar as terrorists, equipped with thermal imaging, ambushed a police mobile on Warsak Road, mere kilometres from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly. 
The assailants utilised thermal technology and snipers to kill three policemen, and then set their patrolling vehicle on fire. 
This attack echoes a similar tragedy from last year, where terrorists struck using night vision and sniper rifles in Peshawar’s Sarband area, claiming the lives of three police officers, including DSP Sardar Hussain.
Such incidents aren’t isolated. Throughout 2022 and early 2023, southern districts like Dera Ismail Khan, Laki Marwat, Tank, and Bannu witnessed a spate of attacks employing American thermal technology, as per police sources familiar with the matter. 
In light of these revelations, security experts warn of the dire implications of this trend. Dr Khurram Iqbal, an expert in security affairs and assistant professor at the Department of International Relations and the National Defense University (NDU), highlighted the evolving dynamics ever since the Taliban came into power in Afghanistan.
“There is evidence to suggest direct support from the Afghan Taliban to organisations like the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP),” he emphasised, inferring that the narrative of terrorists procuring weaponry from the market was giving way to Taliban-backed extremism.In this regard, Inspector General of Police K-P, Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, stressed the urgent need for modernization within law enforcement. “The provincial police must adapt with state-of-the-art equipment and strategies. Our officers are bravely confronting an evolving threat landscape, but they require adequate resources and support to effectively combat these sophisticated tactics,” asserted IG Gandapur. 
However, the stark reality is a glaring disparity between police resources and the evolving threat landscape. 
Official documents reveal antiquated infrastructure and equipment, juxtaposed against the onslaught of modern warfare tactics. With over 400 police stations and more than 500 checkpoints in the province, many lack basic security features, rendering officers vulnerable in the face of escalating dangers.
Albeit to address these challenges, the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has recently decided to spend Rs 3 billion for a security division within the provincial police department, and procure armoured vehicles, bulletproof vests, and thermal imaging technology, it remains to be seen whether the plan will actually see light of day.

2,QMC lacks machinery to clean city,A total of 800 sanitary workers are carrying out cleanliness work in the city of four million people,"The Quetta Metropolitan Corporation (QMC) is facing an acute shortage of machinery and tools as the authority has not purchased new machinery and vehicles for the last thirty years.
The QMC has not been able to collect all the waste produced in the city every day due to a shortage of staff and equipment. A total of 800 sanitary workers are carrying out cleanliness work in the city of four million people. The corporation has sought waste lifting machinery from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority in order to launch a cleanliness drive in the city.
Talking to APP, Quetta Administrator Muhammad Hamza Shafqaat said QMC had not purchased new machinery and vehicles since 1994. He said an operation would be launched to clean the water courses and nullahs for efficient working of the sewerage system so that rain and waste water do not cause inconvenience to the public.
Under the supervision of the Quetta Administrator, the corporation has collected over 10,000 tons of trash from the city in a short period of 12 days. Shafqaat said the authority is all set to collect door-to-door garbage to make Quetta a clean city within two weeks.
The Commissioner said the government had made efforts to increase the waste collecting capacity of QMC by 500 tons to 1,600 tons daily by outsourcing Quetta solid waste management.
He noted that a plan was in the pipeline to carry out solid waste management in Quetta on a public- private partnership basis to improve the city’s sewage system, adding that cleanliness drives were being carried out in every area of the city on a regular basis and that the QMC was ensuring the collection and disposal of garbage in every area of the provincial capital from Sariyab to Nawan Killi.

3,K-P to approach FBR for Rs5b outstanding dues,Finance adviser says delegation will be sent to Islamabad to discuss the matter,"In a bid to secure financial support, the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) government has taken steps to address its outstanding dues from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). 
A sum of Rs5 billion is owed to the K-P Revenue Authority (KPRA), prompting Advisor Finance Muzammil Aslam to reach out to the FBR chairman.
Talking to The Express Tribune, an official said that Advisor Finance Muzammil Aslam has contacted the chairman of FBR over the phone in this regard. Both parties have acknowledged the overdue payment of Rs5 billion and have agreed to dispatch a delegation to Islamabad for further negotiations to resolve the issue.
“The payment of Rs9.4 billion was due and FBR paid Rs4.1 billion in February while the amount of Rs5.3 billion is pending,” he said.
On March 20, the K-P government resolved to engage with the central government regarding its outstanding dues amounting to Rs53 billion over the past two years. 
The announcement came to light during a meeting addressing the budget concerns of the recently merged districts of the province, as conveyed by Aslam.
Aslam elaborated that during the merger in 2018, the federal government committed to an annual payment of Rs66 billion to cover the salaries of government employees in K-P. In addition, a further Rs100 billion was designated for the rapid development of these regions.
Regrettably, Aslam remarked, these commitments have not been honoured, resulting in significant challenges for the province. Despite increased responsibilities, the anticipated resources failed to materialise, leaving the province grappling with financial strain.
On March 17, Muzamal Aslam highlighted a significant decrease in tax collection during the caretaker provincial government, noting a decline of 50 per cent. 
Addressing media representatives, he refuted the claim made by the caretaker chief minister regarding a remaining balance of Rs100 billion in the provincial exchequer, asserting that while the treasury was not entirely depleted, the stated amount was inaccurate. 
Additionally, Aslam, who presided over three separate meetings, reiterated the commitment to foster development in the mines and mineral sector of the province, pledging to introduce incentives to attract investors.
“The caretaker government’s claim that they inherited an empty treasury is not correct. They had enough funds to run the government smoothly and also failed to collect taxes,” he claimed, adding that the tax collection has dropped drastically under the caretakers.
“Rs100 billion is sufficient enough funds. If they had large funds then why did they stop the Sehat Card in the province which largely benefited the marginalised segments of the society in the province,” he noted, adding that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government in the past 10 years received Rs630 billion in loans.
“The provincial government has signed deals with the World Bank and other organisations to obtain another Rs600 billion in loans,” he maintained, adding that the K-P chief minister claimed rightly that the Centre has to pay Rs1,500 billion under the head of net hydel profit.

4,Measles claims over 13 lives in K-P,"DI Khan registers 185, Peshawar 147, Charsadda 113 and Swabi 92 cases","A measles outbreak in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) has resulted in the loss of at least 13 lives over the past six months, official sources disclosed.
According to reports, there have been a total of 3,889 suspected cases and 1,445 confirmed cases of measles recorded in the province. Out of the 22 deaths reported during this period, measles has been confirmed in 13 cases.
The most vulnerable demographic appears to be children aged between two to five years. The Director of the Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) indicated that an outbreak response is currently underway across 118 union councils spanning the province’s 24 districts.
Among the worst-hit districts is DI Khan, reporting 185 cases, followed by Peshawar with 147, Charsadda with 113, Swabi with 92, and Lower Dir with 83 cases respectively.
Health Minister Syed Qasim Ali Shah has responded swiftly to the measles outbreak in the province by instructing the director of the EPI to furnish an urgent report on the situation.
In an appeal to parents, the minister urged them to ensure their children receive timely measles vaccinations. He has further directed immediate emergency measures to be implemented to curb the spread of the outbreak.
Directives have been issued to establish isolation wards within Medical Teaching Institutions (MTI) hospitals to contain the spread of the disease. 
The health minister has instructed the Director-General of Health Services to enhance the functioning of vaccination centres by transferring vaccinators from the jurisdiction of medical superintendents to the supervision of district health officers. 
Moreover, immediate steps have been taken to form a provincial outbreak control committee.
During an urgent briefing provided by Dr Aarif, Director of the Expanded Program on Immunisation, Health Minister Shah was briefed on the severity of the measles outbreak.
