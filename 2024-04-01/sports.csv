0,Tailoring charges soar as Eid approaches,"To meet the rising demand, tailors claim they have hired extra worker","Demand for ready-made clothes has increased in the city due to high tailoring charges as Eid approaches. Citizens claim tailors are charging Rs1,500 to Rs2,000 per suit for stitching. 
To meet the rising demand, tailors in Gardezi Market, Cantt, Hussainagahi and interior city claim they have hired extra workers, which is why the prices have been raised. Mehboob Ali, a tailor in Gardezi Market, said his business increases on Eid every year so this is the right time to make profit. He explained, charges for suit stitching are almost double because of the workload, increase of electricity charges, rents, labour wages and relevant material. 
Shopper Akash claimed, “Buying a ready-made suit with Rs2,000 to 2,500 was more convenient than purchasing an unstitched suit at Rs2,000 and then visiting tailors shops for stitching with Rs1,500 to 2000.” He maintained that he would prefer a ready-made white Shalwar suit for this Eid keeping in view high charges of the tailors. Another customer, Maryam Hamza said that tailors have increased stitching charges due to improper check and balance by the quarters concerned. She said that the district administration must pay attention towards the issues for providing relief to the masses by controlling over-charging.

1,The drum beats at dawn,"With time and innovation, the number of drum-beaters has decreased","Hearing the sound of drums in the quiet of the night is normally considered a cause of alarm—but this is not the case during the holy month of Ramazan. 
According to one legend the practice of using drums to wake people up for Sehri (the meal before fasting commences) first began in 1936. It then became rampant throughout the subcontinent.
In Pakistan, the practice of using drumbeats to wake people up at the crack of dawn for 
Sehri dates back to the pre-partition era, since back then devices such as an alarm clock were not available. Even today, many streets in villages, towns and cities across the country echo with beats of drums, canisters or tins before the morning prayer to help people wake up for fasting. 
The streets are abuzz with various types of Sufi poems or Naats which are recited along the beat of the drum. 
Most Pakistanis are also familiar with the drum beaters announcing, “It's time to wake up; those who fast are rightfully entitled to paradise”. 
In the past, various groups of people used to participate in the tradition of ‘drum-beating’ in every village or town. One such individual was 70-year-old Sheikh Ghulam Nabi. He served as a drum-beater in Lahore throughout his life and it his “ancestral profession”. Nabi recounts his elder brother Sheikh Ghulam Rasool also used to do the same work. A few years ago, his elder brother was crossing the road while beating the drum at night when a car hit him from behind, leaving him dead on the spot. Even after the death of his brother, Nabi didn’t abandon what he considers to be his duty and continued drum-beating. The veteran drum-beater added that he wakes up at two in the morning and goes round the whole area with his drum, waking people up by reciting Naat and making announcements. The night before Eid is special as he goes out beating the drums for one last time, signalling his demand for a reward against his service throughout the month. 
Nabi says that people willingly give money, clothes, rations and donations. However he also pointed out that people are not as enthusiastic as before. While some don’t see a point to this ritual; others are bound by the inflation which prevents them from offering anything to the drumbeater.
With time and innovation, the number of drum-beaters in the city has decreased. These individuals now prefer opting for other fields. For example, Ghulam Murtaza, son of the veteran drum-beater Sheikh Ghulam Nabi, has formed his own drum group in the city, but he makes his living by playing drums at wedding parties.
There are only a few neighborhoods left in Lahore where the sound of drums or canisters is considered normal during Ramazan. 
Moreover, the new generation, in particular, is not aware of the tradition.
Saeed Ahmad Cheema, a resident of Lahore says that waking people up by playing the drum is a tradition that reminds him of his childhood, when people lived a simple life. In those days, the status of the drum was like an alarm. People used to wake up hearing the sound of drum and prepare for Suhoor. Now there are requirements of modern time, people don't need to wake up by street drumbeats. 
Recently, new traditions related to Ramazan have emerged in the city. For instance, young boys are seen playing cricket all night on the streets. Adding to that, late night tea houses in the city remain crowded till the crack of dawn. In this modern scenario, many find the sound of a drum or a canister pointless and even annoying. Those opposed to the tradition also claim that children and sick people are disturbed by the sound of drums at night. 
On the other hand, there are some people who are trying to keep this tradition alive for the sake of tradition and keeping this ancient occupation alive.

4,Online mobilisers to push vaccination,Move aimed at countering misinformation regarding polio,"The Punjab Emergency Operation Centre is set to launch an online campaign to help eradicate poliovirus from the province.
The campaign will be launched in Lahore and other districts under an online global strategy in the coming weeks.
The emergency operation centre has decided to take help of online social mobilisers to spread awareness about polio vaccination and the disease.
According to sources, the Punjab Emergency Operation Centre will solicit the services of top social mobilisers to dispel misinformation about the vaccination, disease and health issues. The decision had been taken because misinformation and propaganda about the vaccination and disease on social media were confusing the public. 
Although Punjab has been polio-free for the past three years, the threat of polio persists. 
Especially the detection of wild poliovirus last year in environmental samples from Gulshan-e-Ravi in Lahore left the Punjab government, health department and related officials concerned. 
After the development, several major anti-polio campaigns were launched, but it has been evident that still area instances of denial in some areas amidst misinformation regarding polio vaccination, especially on social media. 
In view of the situation, the departments concerned are focusing on strategies to counter the misinformation. For the first time, the focus will also be on online awareness to eradicate polio. 
In this regard, an event was organised in Lahore under the UInfluencers umbrella. The initiative, supported by a network of social media influencers, aimed to tackle health-related misinformation, particularly that concerning polio vaccination. 
According to a statement, with a turnout of over 10,000 volunteers from the country, UInfluencers emerged as a powerful advocate to promote children's health and immunisation across digital platforms.
The event marked a milestone as it transitioned from the digital realm to a physical gathering, bringing together 36 online volunteers from the outskirts of Lahore. The young individuals, representing a cross-section of society, immersed themselves in the realities of polio vaccination through hands-on experiences and informative presentations.
The online social mobilisers also visited the Lahore Railway Station for a firsthand look at the dedicated efforts of health workers vaccinating the children. They learned about the scale of the campaign, with approximately 20,000 children vaccinated each day during the period. 
Online social mobilisers Muneeza, Saeeda Kanwal and Abdullah expressed appreciation for the crucial contributions of health workers and the significance of vaccination. 
""Witnessing the dedication of health workers was a profound experience that deepened my respect for them,"" Muneeza said.
Saeeda Kanwal, reflecting on her 25 years in Lahore, acknowledged the importance of raising awareness about the polio programme, stating, ""We all share the responsibility to spread this information among our communities.""
Abdullah, hailing from Pakpattan, highlighted the importance of addressing community misconceptions about the polio vaccine, empowered by his newfound understanding of the issue.
The participants actively posted in support of polio vaccination and its authenticity. A digital media influencer, Momin Saqib, emphasised the power of social media in spreading positive information.
The Coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, Dr Shahzad Baig, underscored the importance of community engagement and accurate information dissemination in dispelling myths and misconceptions about polio vaccination.
Ayesha, a polio survivor and health worker, shared her inspiring story, reinforcing the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of the disease.
""We earlier had the services of the social mobilisers who were doing a wonderful job during our fight against polio. But it is also right that there is misinformation in the society and for this purpose now we are getting the service of the online social mobilisers to play their effective role to counter misinformation,” said Punjab Emergency Operation Centre spokesman Wasif Butt.

5,Govt monopoly on vehicle number plates ends,Decision comes after years of administrative challenges,"The Punjab Excise Department has taken steps to overhaul the issuance of computerised number plates for vehicles, including a shift away from the government's monopoly towards an open competition in the manufacturing and distribution of the essential identifiers.
According to officials, the decision comes after years of public grievances and administrative challenges.
Despite collection of fees from approximately three million vehicle owners in the province over the past three years, many had been left waiting for their number plates to be issued.
Recognising the need for reform, the provincial cabinet has approved the abolition of the government's monopoly on number plate manufacturing. Instead, an open licensing regime has been endorsed, allowing multiple companies and institutions to participate in the production process.
Under the new system, applicants will no longer be required to pay fees for new computerised number plates, signalling a departure from the previous practice.
The sources said the move aims to streamline the registration process and eliminate unnecessary financial burdens on vehicle and motorcycle owners.
Excise Director General Faisal Fareed has initiated the implementation of the cabinet's decision.
A notification has been sent to Excise Secretary Masood Mukhtar, outlining the immediate cessation of fee collection for number plates with new or duplicate registration requests.
The officials said the transition to an open licensing regime is expected to foster healthy competition among private companies registered under the framework. They estimate that vehicle owners stand to save up to Rs500 on number plates compared to the current government prices.
However, challenges remain as the department grapples with the legacy of past inefficiencies. The backlog of pending number plates for millions of citizens poses a complex logistical and administrative dilemma. 
The officials said previous attempts to modernise the vehicle registration system, including partnerships with federal agencies, had faced challenges and disputes over fee structures.
