0,IHC allows Imran to meet Bushra Bibi on Eid,Court also orders additional provision of one meeting per week,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) allowed on Monday a meeting between incarcerated former premier Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi over Eidul Fitr. 
The court heard a plea by the former first lady pertaining to her transfer to Adiala jail and meeting her husband in prison over Eid. 
 
The court directed that the two should be allowed to meet over the occasion and additionally allowed a meeting per week between the two. 
Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb observed that the government holds the right to declare any private property as sub-jail.
The state counsel informed the court that, according to its directive, the director of law conducted an inspection of Bani Gala sub-jail and subsequently submitted a report.
The court instructed the counsel to furnish a copy of the report to the petitioner, stating that the visiting officer of Bani Gala sub-jail had expressed satisfaction with the facilities provided.
Justice Miangul expressed displeasure at the jail administration of Adiala jail for not permitting Bushra to meet Imran and for not transferring the PTI founder's wife to Adiala Jail.

Justice Miangul raised concerns regarding the alleged overcrowding in Adiala jail and highlighted that despite claims of overcrowding, “since the January 31 sentence, 141 women were admitted”.
The court criticized the justification given for not transferring Bushra Bibi, asserting that it lacked coherence in light of the ongoing admissions.
Justice Miangul also admonished the administration for its failure to satisfy the court's concerns and observed that they undermined the rule of law.
The hearing was then adjourned indefinitely.
On January 31, Bushra Bibi voluntarily surrendered before the accountability court after receiving a 14-year sentence in the Toshakhana case.
On February 22, the IHC was informed by the Adiala jail superintendent that former premier Imran Khan's wife could not be shifted to the prison due to 'security threats'.
Both Imran and his wife are sentenced to 14 years imprisonment in the Toshakhana case and are also barred from holding any public office for the next 10 years. They are fined a combined amount of Rs1,574 million.

1,Hamas accuses Fatah of sending security men to Gaza,A Palestinian Authority official denied the resistance group's accusations,"The Palestinian resistance group Hamas accused rivals with the Palestinian Authority of sending security officers into northern Gaza under cover of securing aid trucks, the Gaza Hamas-run interior ministry said.
A Palestinian Authority official denied the resistance group's accusations.
A senior Hamas interior ministry official told the group's Al-Aqsa TV, that the force's mission was supervised by Majed Faraj, the Palestinian Authority's chief of intelligence
It said six members of the force, who escorted aid trucks coming through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, were arrested and police forces were in pursuit to round up all other members.
""The suspicious security force that entered yesterday with Egyptian Crescent trucks coordinated its operations entirely with the (Israeli) occupation forces,” the Hamas official said, without providing evidence. The Red Crescent is the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross.
The statement by the so-called Hamas interior ministry over the aid entry into Gaza Strip is incorrect,"" a Palestinian Authority official in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said in a statement.
The official, referring to the Israel war on Gaza, said the authority wasn't interested in an exchange of media comments that would divert attention from ""the suffering of our people in Gaza Strip, and the killing, starvation, and displacement they are living through.""
The statement posted by Hamas' Al-Aqsa TV on its Telegram accounts said police officers and fighters of militant factions were instructed to treat any forces that entered Gaza without coordination with them as an ""occupation force.""
The Palestinian resistance group Hamas seized control in Gaza in 2007, a year after sweeping elections, following a brief civil war with Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces, reducing the PA's rule to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Efforts to reconcile the two sides have so far failed over thorny power-sharing issues.
Hamas leaders vowed any attempt to exclude the group from Gaza rule after the war ended was ""delusional.""

2,"Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal sent to jail until April 15 in graft case, media reports say",India's financial crime-fighting agency had arrested Kejriwal in connection with corruption allegations,"An Indian court sent Delhi chief minister and key opposition leader Arvind Kejriwal to jail until April 15 in a liquor graft case on Monday, local media reported, less than three weeks before the country begins voting in national elections.
India's financial crime-fighting agency had arrested Kejriwal in connection with corruption allegations related to the city's liquor policy and he had been remanded to the agency's custody until April 1.
Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) says he has been ""falsely arrested"" in a ""fabricated"" case, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and his Bharatiya Janata Party deny political interference.
Lawyers for the agency said on Monday that Kejriwal had been ""non-cooperative"" and was ""giving evasive replies"" and asked the court to remand him to judicial custody for 15 days, news website Live Law reported.
Kejriwal blamed Modi for his arrest.
""What the prime minister is doing is not good for the country,"" he told reporters on his way to court.
All the senior leaders of AAP were already imprisoned in the same graft case before Kejriwal's arrest.
The action against the high-profile leader sparked protests in the capital and the northern state of Punjab, which is also governed by his party, last week.
The court's decision comes a day after the INDIA bloc, an alliance of 27 opposition parties including AAP, came together at a rally in New Delhi to protest against Kejriwal's arrest and accused Modi of seeking to rig the elections.
Besides AAP, several other opposition parties, including regional groups, are also facing action from federal agencies, which they say is ""politically motivated"".
The country's main opposition Congress party says it has been hit with large income tax demands which it says is an effort to ""cripple it financially"" before the elections.
Modi and the BJP have denied the allegations.
Kejriwal's arrest has also drawn international attention, with the U.S. and Germany urging a ""fair"" and ""impartial"" trial, causing New Delhi to strongly object by asking them to stay away from its ""internal"" affairs.

3,Shawwal moon to likely be sighted on April 9,PMD says birth of the Shawwal moon expected to emerge on the night of April 8 at 11:21 pm,"The sighting of the Shawwal moon, marking the end of Ramazan, is likely on Tuesday, April 9, across Pakistan, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
According to PMD, the birth of the Shawwal moon is expected to emerge on the night of April 8 at 11:21 pm local time.
By April 9, the moon's age is expected to range between 19 to 20 hours, with an anticipated duration of moon sighting after sunset of more than 50 minutes on the horizon.
Clear skies are forecasted for most locations across the southern regions of the country, including Karachi, on April 9. However, northern areas may experience cloudy conditions during the moon sighting.

PMD said that if the moon is sighted on April 9, Eidul Fitr will be celebrated on Wednesday, April 10.
Eidul Fitr is a significant religious festival celebrated by Muslims worldwide, marked with prayers, feasting, and the exchange of gifts among family and friends.
As the auspicious occasion of Eidul Fitr approaches, Pakistanis are preparing for a potentially extended holiday period, with six days set aside for festivities and celebrations.
In 2019, the IT ministry introduced the lunar calendar to address concerns related to moon sightings and ensure uniformity in Eid celebrations.
Endorsed by the meteorological department, this calendar has become instrumental in determining the dates of various Islamic events, including Eidul Fitr.
Traditionally, Eid holidays commence a day earlier than the anticipated date to allow individuals ample time for preparations and to partake in the joyous festivities.
With the government contemplating a four-day holiday starting from April 9 (Tuesday) to April 12 (Friday), coupled with the usual weekend holidays on Saturday and Sunday observed by both government and select private offices, the total holiday period is expected to span six days.
Eidul Fitr holds immense cultural and religious significance for Muslims worldwide, marking the end of the holy month of Ramazan characterised by fasting, prayer, and reflection.
In Pakistan, the festival is celebrated with fervour, as families come together to exchange greetings, share meals, and extend acts of charity to the less fortunate.

4,K-P governor advocates unopposed Senate polls,PHC to hear PTI’s petition against ECP's potential delay in Senate polls,"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Governor Haji Ghulam Ali has offered his good offices to political parties in the province to reach a consensus ahead of April 2 Senate elections and get their candidates elected to the upper house of the parliament unopposed.
“Like Punjab and Balochistan, senators should also be elected unopposed in the K-P. The Governor House is open for politics of reconciliation,” Ali said on Sunday while speaking in an event held at the Governor House in connection with distribution of a Ramazan package.
Uncertainty shrouds the Senate elections in K-P as the PTI-backed provincial government employs delaying tactics to impede newly elected opposition candidates on reserved seats from participating in the April 2 Senate polls. The PTI has approached the Peshawar High Court (PHC) seeking intervention to prevent the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) from postponing the Senate elections due to the delayed administration of oaths to opposition parties’ candidates-elect.
The PHC is slated to consider the PTI’s petition today (Monday).
Earlier, the PTI, having lost its election symbol before the February 8 general elections, fielded its candidates as independents. Later, PTI-backed independents aligned with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) to secure reserved seats for women and minorities.
However, the ECP rebuffed the party’s request, contending that the SIC failed to submit its priority list for such seats before the polls. The ECP decided to allocate reserved seats among other parties based on their general seats.
The PHC upheld the ECP order. While hearing petitions filed by opposition parties, the court last week also directed the K-P speaker to administer oaths to MPA-elects on reserved seats to enable their participation in the Senate elections.
To comply with the court order and hinder the oath-taking of opposition candidates before the Senate polls, the PTI-backed provincial government summoned the assembly session on the election day, April 2.
Although the session's timing was not specified, it is expected to commence after the Senate election on Tuesday evening, effectively forestalling the participation of opposition candidates in voting.
Currently, the PTI-backed MPAs number 91, while opposition lawmakers total 27. If Senate elections precede the administration of oaths to new MPAs elected on reserved seats, the PTI is poised to win 10 Senate seats, including two women and two technocrats’ seats, with the opposition securing just one of the 11 seats up for grabs.
However, if women and minority MPAs in the K-P assembly take oaths before the Senate polls, the PTI is expected to lose at least four seats, including two general and one technocrat and women's seat each.
The ECP has warned that Senate elections in K-P will be postponed if the provincial government refuses to hold the assembly session and delays the oath-taking ceremony.
Adviser to the K-P CM on Information Muhammad Ali Saif emphasized that the ECP is obligated by law to hold elections within a specific timeframe.
The ECP has completed its preparation for the Senate elections, including printing of ballot papers and transmission of election material to returning officers.
Out of the vacant 48 seats in the Senate, 18 candidates have been elected unopposed. Elections will be held for the remaining 30 seats, including 11 seats from the K-P.
According to the final list of candidates issued by returning officers, the 18 candidates elected unopposed include 7 candidates elected on general seats from Punjab and all 11 candidates from Balochistan— including 7 elected on general seats, 2 on women seats, and 2 on technocrat/academia seats.
Now the election is scheduled to be held for one general and one technocrat seat in Islamabad; 2 women seats, 2 technocrat/academia seats and one non-Muslim’s seat in Punjab; 7 general seats, 2 women seats, 2 technocrat/academia seats, and one non-Muslim seat in Sindh, and 7 general seats, 2 women seats, and 2 technocrat seats in the K-P.
In the K-P, 16 candidates are contesting for seven general seats.
These include PTI-backed independent candidates—Asif Rafiq, Azhar Mashwani, Khurram Zeeshan, Dilawar Khan, Shafqat Ayaz, Irfan Salim, Faisal Javed, Faizur Rahman, Muhammad Azam Swati, Muhammad Waqas Orazkzai, Murad Saeed, Mirza Muhammad Afridi, and Peer Noor-ul-Haq Qadri. PML-N’s Niaz Ahmed, PPP’s Muhammad Talha Mahmood, and JUI-F’s Attaullah Darwish are also contesting for the general seats.
Four candidates are contesting for two reserved seats for women.
They include Rubina Khalid from the PPP and three independents—Rubina Naz, Ayesha Banu, and Mahwash Ali Khan. There are six candidates for two technocrat seats--Dilawar Khan from the JUI-F as well as five independents Khalid Masood, Syed Arshad Hussain, Azam Swati, Noor-ul-Haq Qadri, and Waqar Ahmed Qazi.

7,PTI to intensify campaign post Eid,Party stages rally in Peshawar; pays tribute to IHC judges," 
The PTI staged a rally in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) provincial capital on Sunday to express solidarity with the judiciary and demand the release of former prime minister Imran Khan.
The rally, led by PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, was attended by thousands of PTI workers and leaders, including the party’s secretary-general, Omar Ayub, Vice President Sher Afzal Marwat, Faisal Javed, Azam Swati, District President Sher Ali Arbab, and K-P Additional Secretary-General Irfan Saleem.
The participants of the rally marched from the Peshawar Press Club to the Peshawar High Court building.
Addressing the participants, the leaders stated that all cases registered against PTI founder Imran Khan were fabricated, and he was convicted after faulty trials.
They announced plans to intensify their campaign for Imran's freedom after Eidul Fitr. The party will offer stiff resistance to the government’s coercive measures and bring about a revolution, they claimed.
The speakers also paid tribute to the six Islamabad High Court judges who last week unveiled the coercive tactics allegedly employed by state institutions to influence court cases. These judges have exhibited exemplary courage and unveiled the truth, they said.

8,ANP slams Qaiser’s advice to snap ties with govt,Zahid Khan terms PTI leader's advice a 'revolt',"Awami National Party (ANP) leader Zahid Khan berated PTI's Asad Qaiser for his recent advice to the Chief Minister of Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), urging him to sever all ties with the federal government.
The PTI central leader's counsel to K-P Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, advising him to cut off all connections with the federal administration due to anticipated non-compliance with his demands, drew a sharp rebuke from Zahid.
Qaiser's directive came following a meeting between Gandapur and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi in Peshawar to discuss anti-terrorism strategies.
""This is my advice to the K-P chief minister that he should end all contact with the federation as it [the federal government] will not accept any of his demands,"" Qaiser stated while pointing out the lack of response to staffing requests and the unresolved issue of provincial arrears.
Speaking to a private news channel, Zahid termed Qaiser's advice a ""revolt,"" expressing concern over its potential consequences and likening such sentiments to acts of disloyalty if espoused by his own party.
Reflecting on the developmental progress post-18th Amendment, Zahid lamented the decline in growth since PTI assumed power in 2013, highlighting the current financial strain on the provincial government, which struggles to meet basic salary obligations.
Criticising PTI's leadership, Zahid questioned the efficacy of Qaiser's directives, suggesting a lack of grassroots representation within the party's ranks. He underscored the necessity for political acumen in leadership roles, particularly in navigating intricate governmental dynamics.
“If you cut ties with the Centre, then what will you achieve? Our province will suffer,” he said, adding that the provincial government did not even have money to pay salaries at the moment. He decried that K-P was being made a “sacrificial goat”.
Reiterating the gravity of Qaiser's stance, Zahid warned of the potential imposition of the governor's rule should the situation escalate further, emphasising the need for prudent dialogue and collaborative efforts for sustainable governance.

9,SIC’s reserved seats issue lands in SC,Party challenges PHC verdict depriving party of its share,"The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), comprising PTI-backed lawmakers, challenged on Monday the Peshawar High Court’s March 14 order that deprived the party of reserved seats.
The PHC through its verdict dashed the PTI's hopes of getting reserved seats as it dismissed the SIC’s petition challenging the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) ruling that denied reserved seats to the party.
Advocate Faisal Siddiqui filed the petition, on behalf of the PTI-backed-SIC, that stated, “It is, therefore, most respectfully and most humbly prayed that leave to appeal against the Impugned Judgment dated: 14-03-2024 passed by the Honourable Peshawar High Court in Writ Petition No.1272-P of 2024, may graciously be granted and after granting leave to appeal, this Honourable Court may graciously set aside the Impugned Judgment dated: 14-03-2024 and allow the Writ Petition No.1272-P of 2024, as prayed.”
The petition states that the PTI candidates joined the SIC after their party lost its electoral symbol, adding that the ECP also raised no objections to the above independent returned candidates joining the SIC.
“The Impugned Judgment is based on a fundamental misconception and misinterpretation of Article 51 as well as Article 106 of Constitution, 1973,” the petition read.
The party has contended that the fundamental premise of the proportional representation system for allocating reserved seats for women and non-Muslims, as outlined in Article 51(6)(d)(e) and Article 106(3)(c) of the Constitution, 1973, does not hinge on whether a political party submits candidate lists for reserved seats before the general election or whether the party contested the election.
Instead, the party asserts that the core constitutional basis for the right to reserved seats under the proportional representation system is determined by the ""total number of general seats secured by each political party from the province concerned in the National Assembly"" or the ""total number of general seats secured by each political party in the provincial assembly.
""PTI loses reserve seatsA five-member bench led by PHC Chief Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan and comprising Justice Ijaz Anwar, Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, Justice Shakeel Ahmad, and Justice Arshad Ali ruled against PTI’s right to reserve seats.
During his arguments, SIC’s lawyer Barrister Ali Zafar said the Constitution does not mention when a party has to submit a list of names for reserved seats to the ECP.
He argued that it is not written anywhere that a person cannot resubmit the list or when it has to be submitted, adding that there is no restriction on providing a second list and that the ECP could have issued a second schedule, as it did for the general elections.
Justice Ijaz Anwar remarked that as per the law, those who participate in elections will get seats.
The court then questioned Barrister Zafar if it was not clearly stated anywhere that the second schedule could not be issued. ""The law does not prevent the Election Commission from issuing another schedule,"" the lawyer responded.
Justice Arshad Ali remarked that Section 104 explains the mechanism for reserved seats as it states that when a list is submitted another can be given.
""Section 104 says that if a political party participates in an election, it will give a list,"" the lawyer argued.
He earlier argued that whoever wins the number of seats, gets reserved seats in the same proportion and their seats cannot be increased.
Earlier, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan informed the PHC that the SIC was denied the reserved seats because it did not contest the February 8 general elections.
Justice Ibrahim inquired whether any SIC candidate succeeded in the February 8 election, to which Anwar replied negatively. Justice Arshad noted that even the SIC chairman contested the election as an independent candidate.
The AGP defended the ECP's decision, stating that the SIC had not submitted any list for the allocation of reserved seats before the election, a mandatory requirement under the law.
Responding to a query about redistributing the seats to other parties if not allocated to the SIC, the AGP asserted that parliament would be incomplete without the allocation of those seats, emphasizing the importance of representation for women and minorities.
On March 4, the ECP accepted applications of the opposing parties and decided that the seats in the National Assembly and provincial assemblies would not remain vacant and would be allocated by a proportional representation process of political parties based on seats won by political parties.
