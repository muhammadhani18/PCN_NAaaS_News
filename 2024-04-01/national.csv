0,Facilitating Article 6 implementation for climate goals,Article designed to facilitate trade in emissions reduction credits between countries,"In the global fight against climate change, it has become abundantly clear that public funds are insufficient to finance the NDCs of developing nations.
Most emission reduction activities must be financed and implemented by the private sector. Suitable finance approaches are therefore required – and this is where Article 6 of the Paris Agreement stands out as a pivotal mechanism in the global fight against climate change.
Article 6 is designed to transform international climate action by facilitating the trade of emission reduction credits between countries. This strategy not only aims at carbon reduction but also supports developing nations to achieve their climate targets. Article 6 introduces the concept of “Internationally Transferrable Mitigation Outcomes” (ITMOs), under which countries can cut their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by investing in projects that reduce emissions in other countries.
However, these projects need to be ‘real,’ ‘verified,’ and ‘additional,’ requiring a rigorous approval process before being reported, underscoring the need for international collaboration and substantial capacity development for countries like Pakistan. But what is Article 6, and how does it assist a country to meet its nationally determined contribution (NDC) targets?
Article 6 creates a collaborative framework for nations and private organisations to participate in climate change mitigation. It identifies and encourages opportunities for verifiable emission reductions, attracts funding to implement them, and allows cooperation among countries and other groups to conduct and benefit from these activities. Within Article 6, there are three tools that countries can draw upon: Article 6.2 allows countries to exchange mitigation outcomes bilaterally and report their trade and use them towards their NDCs.
Article 6.4 establishes a new UNFCCC mechanism for the validation, verification, and issuance of high-quality carbon credits, and Article 6.8 provides opportunities for countries to cooperate towards the achievement of their NDCs without relying on carbon markets. Practically, partnerships under Article 6 can take several forms. For example, under Article 6.2, Country A may sell excess carbon reductions from renewable energy projects to Country B, assisting it in meeting its NDC targets.
Article 6.4 enables a corporation in Country C to support reforestation in Country D, resulting in carbon credits for sale on the international market to offset emissions. Furthermore, Article 6.8 allows Country E to share its energy efficiency programme with others, promoting non-market cooperation. However, while this mechanism has much potential, its complexity necessitates significant capacity building and a detailed needs assessment, which can be difficult for countries with limited resources.
Read Body to identify climate change issues
Countries are beginning to prepare for Article 6 “readiness” to ensure they have all the necessary capacities, systems, and institutional frameworks in place to engage in international cooperation fairly and transparently.
This readiness is vital since it augments national efforts by incentivising private sector’s involvement in global carbon reduction initiatives, providing a structured path for financing and cost-effective implementation of emission reduction projects beyond borders.
Countries like Japan and Switzerland have established frameworks for purchasing ITMOs and incorporating them into their NDCs, showcasing the practical applications of collaborative climate action. Against this backdrop, the Supporting Preparedness for Article 6 Cooperation (SPAR6C) emerges as a crucial initiative, particularly for countries like Pakistan, which are poised to leverage the mechanisms under Article 6 to accelerate their climate action and sustainable development goals.
Funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK), through the German government’s International Climate Initiative (IKI) and led by the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), SPAR6C operates with a consortium of partners, including Carbon Limits, GFA Consulting, Kommunalkredit Public Consulting, and the United Nations Environment Programme Copenhagen Climate Centre.
It is a five-year, 20-million-euro programme being implemented in Pakistan, Zambia, Colombia, and Thailand and is designed to assist them in navigating and leveraging the mechanisms outlined in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, enabling international cooperation on carbon markets. The initiative aims to demystify the complex processes associated with Article 6, facilitating its understanding and application across these diverse geopolitical landscapes.
The comprehensive programme includes six interlinked work packages: four in-country programmes (focusing on medium- and long-term emissions planning, governance frameworks, and mitigation activity development) and two global (Community of Practice for Article 6 Implementing Countries and Article 6 toolbox). By fostering knowledge exchange and promoting the application of innovative climate solutions, SPAR6C is dedicated to amplifying national climate ambitions and catalysing investments in GHG mitigation, paving the way for a more sustainable and resilient global community.
For Pakistan, SPAR6C is even more crucial. The country faces a formidable climate challenge, with a financial gap estimated at $101 billion for its energy sector’s transition alone. Pakistan’s ambitious goal to slash GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 underlines the urgency of mobilising significant investment in GHG mitigation projects. Here, SPAR6C plays a pivotal role by catalysing investments and laying the foundation for ITMO trading under cooperative approaches, effectively turning the challenges of Article 6 into opportunities for national development and global environmental benefits.
Moreover, SPAR6C’s efforts extend beyond financial mobilisation. By enhancing the capacity of national stakeholders to prepare and approve Article 6 transactions, the initiative is empowering Pakistan to bolster its climate action capabilities. This is complemented by developing essential tools and guidelines for effective participation in Article 6 initiatives, promoting a deeper understanding and engagement with the international carbon market.
Another innovative strategy introduced by SPAR6C is with the Community of Practice for Article 6 Implementing Countries (CoP-ASIC). This initiative is set to revolutionise how Article 6 is implemented through a groundbreaking “learning by doing” strategy.
By engaging graduate students in a Research Mentorship Programme (RMP) and facilitating their entry into sectors like government, NGOs, and the private sector, CoP-ASIC creates a vibrant platform for exchanging strategies and insights into Article 6 globally.
This initiative, particularly beneficial for Pakistan, seeks to close the gap between academia and industry, fostering a new generation of carbon pricing experts and enhancing national capacity in carbon market engagement.
CoP-ASIC’s annual workshops and financial support for student research underscore its commitment to nurturing sustainable climate strategies in Pakistan and beyond. For the inaugural batch, RMP received 77 applications from the four SPAR6C programme countries, out of which eight finalists have been selected to receive research support, followed by funded internships at reputed international organisations. The maximum number of applications came from Pakistan at 37, showing a substantial interest in the programme.
Amidst the global discourse surrounding climate change, there is no second view that collaboration across borders, sectors, and disciplines is the cornerstone of effective climate action. An essential step towards fostering this collaborative spirit was taken during COP28 at the Pakistan pavilion with the release of the Readiness and Needs Assessment (RNA), which identifies critical gaps and offers a path for Article 6 implementation among SPAR6C member nations.

1,Do global economic policies entrap nations?,"Examining the covert tactics shaping national economies, with Pakistan as a case study","World War II concluded with the end of a multipolar world. Under the umbrella of the United States, the West initiated the process of creating a unipolar world, but the emergence of the USSR did not allow the West to create a unipolar world. The West came up with another strategy and began constructing a global economic and financial system to dominate the post-World War II world. The West wanted to hegemonise the world through these institutions. Since then, global economic and financial institutions have been consolidating their position and control. The fall of the USSR provided them an opportunity to renew their efforts to create a unipolar world. End of History and Clash of Civilisation theories were constructed to further the agenda. The financial and economic institutions are spearheading the efforts to deliver desired results.
These are creating an invisible colonised world. They come in the name of help or reforms and weave an invisible web to control the country. There are four specific instruments: free market currency rates, premature opening up of the economy, and the State Bank, which are used to control the countries. It is an established fact that in a liberal economy, the State Bank plays the leading role in steering the economy. It determines the interest rate, which portrays the picture of investment and potential investment. The liberal economy emphasises the autonomy of the State Bank to weaken the control of the state over financial resources and the economy of the country. Weak or debt-trapped countries are compelled to follow the instructions and let the State Bank be autonomous.
Second, weak and debt-trapped countries are further pushed to leave the currency exchange rate to market forces. This opens the gates of manipulation and speculative market forces. In collaboration with the hoarding industry, the speculative forces create an artificial shortage of currency of reference (US$). Third, premature opening is another instrument to control the economies—premature opening of the economy, open markets to advanced economies, and productive forces. The global players start to dominate the local market. Local producers cannot compete with global players, and local players are starting to disappear from the market. Ultimately, the country became the hub of import of foreign products. It leads to a current account deficit. Fourth, privatisation is promoted as a cure for all economic ills. The liberal economy presents it as the ultimate solution and pathfinder. They ask the world to believe that the private sector is the most efficient and let the private sector run the business. The liberal economic system asks governments to concentrate on tax collection to run the state. Simultaneously, it advocates on behalf of private companies to provide them subsidies and tax incentives. It is interesting to note that, on the one hand, it prohibits providing subsidies to state-owned enterprises, but on the other hand, it encourages subsidies for the private sector.
The liberal institutions have applied the same instruments to Pakistan. Since the launch of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP), Pakistan has been on this invisible web. After the start of SAP, Pakistan continued to lose independent space for policymaking and reforms. First, Pakistan initiated the process of privatisation. The process was institutionalised under the PML-N-led government by establishing the Privatisation Commission of Pakistan. From its inception to today, PC has pushed hard towards privatisation. It has accelerated its efforts during the interim government and shortlisted some major companies for sale. The argument is that running a business is not for the government, and state-owned enterprises need subsidies to keep them running. If it is not the government’s job to provide livelihoods and a safe and prosperous life, then whose responsibility is it? Second, if the state has to provide direct and indirect subsidies to the private sector, then why can’t the state provide those subsidies to State-Owned Enterprises?

Second, Pakistan introduced premature economic opening and followed shock therapy. Pakistan suddenly started to open up its economy without doing much homework. The country did not enhance its production capacity and efficiency of the production sector. Nor did it meet the prerequisites of opening up, such as improving the quality and variety of products and enhancing its competitiveness. Moreover, Pakistan made a few mistakes by blindly following the reform agenda. For example, Pakistan started privatising government entities and opening strategic sectors without building the institutes and institutional capacity. The opening up of energy is a classic example on this front. Under the Power Policy of 1994, which the PPP government introduced, Pakistan sold power plants and offered lucrative incentives to the private sector in the energy sector. The policy has wrecked the economic and social fabric of the country.
Third, the IMF pushed Pakistan to surrender control over the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in the name of reforms and a liberal economy. The PTI government agreed with the IMF to make the SBP an autonomous body and imported the governor to run it. New arrangements shed off the fiscal contribution responsibility, and the SBP was tasked with controlling Pakistan’s monetary policy and inflation. Moreover, PTI agreed to let market forces decide the exchange rate. Pakistani rupee started to lose its value. It is pertinent to mention here that the market exchange rate can work for strong currencies like the dollar or, to some extent, for stable markets. However, weak currencies and economies like Pakistan cannot apply it without loss.
In a nutshell, these actions weakened Pakistan’s control over its economy, which is creating multiple problems. The IMF and other institutes and countries are using this as an opportunity to pressure Pakistan to get the desired results. Unfortunately, Pakistan did not learn from this and is putting all efforts into complying with the demands of the IMF. For example, Pakistan has accelerated work to privatise PIA and Steel Mills of Pakistan to make the IMF happy. So that Pakistan can get a new programme. The liberal consultants or consultants supported by Western institutions and liberal experts trained in the West are advocating for such arrangements. They have direct access to policymakers and use accessibility to convince policymakers to follow the IMF and other institutions. However, they do not share the other side of the story, which makes it easy for them to convince policymakers.
It is feared that the new programme will further weaken control over the economy. However, it does not mean that Pakistan should not deal with the IMF; instead, it should act as a sovereign state. Pakistan must tell the IMF what it can and cannot do.
In conclusion, Pakistan should understand that the IMF can only provide temporary breathing space. However, this breathing space comes with complications. Pakistan needs to work on a long-term solution and utilise indigenous wisdom. The liberal economic model can be the ultimate solution in the End of History theory, but not in reality.

2,Abrupt ALR implementation: solutions sought,Newly imposed Axle Load Regime costs extra billions of rupees in goods transportation,"Leading business leaders have presented a couple of proposals to find solutions to the problems arising in the wake of a sudden implementation of the Axle Load Regime (ALR) of the National Highway Safety Ordinance (NHSO) 2000.
The ALR, re-implemented on Nov 12, 2023, is hitting local trade, exports and imports. They said the authority concerned imposed the ALR and adopted a pitch that highways are being broken.
The previously implemented ALR in 2019 also caused disruptions in the supply chain of all commodities and products including rice, wheat, wheat flour, grains, feed, fertiliser, edible oil, cement, coal, steel, cotton and others.
They said billions of rupees have been spent on highways and motorways which cannot afford heavy transport. Implementing the ALR at once will trigger another wave of inflation.
Following sudden implementation of the new ALR, extra costs of essential commodities (fertiliser, edible oilseeds, poultry, fruits, vegetables, sugarcane, refined sugar, rice, wheat, grains and others) through commercial transport vehicles are estimated at around Rs263 billion per annum. To address the adverse effects on the economy, there is a need to draw up a policy through consensus among relevant industries and sectors for a phase-wise implementation of the ALR.
Pakistan has to scale up exports significantly to meet the government’s commitments, and export promises cannot be met without reducing the cost of transport. In turn, the cost of transport cannot be reduced without shipments via cheap waterways. Scores of traders, exporters, importers and others using highways or motorways are of the view that road users can pay maintenance costs of the highways constructed with bitumen, or pay construction cost of another extra RCC (Reinforced Cement Concrete) road lane built along highways as roads with asphalt do not suit heavy vehicular traffic.

They also urged the government to set up Waterways Development Authority to construct waterways at less than half the cost of ML-1 (which may transport a maximum of 30,000 tonnes per day), while cheap waterways can transport 300,000 tonnes or more.
For the fast growing transport requirement, new roads will cost many times more than the development of waterways. The Waterways Development Authority will propose legislation for overall rules and regulations as well as management, particularly to permit private sector investment (where citizens have already purchased land on waterfront but cannot progress as no legislation exists).
“Before fully implementing the regime, it should be realised that still much is to be done to immediately rehabilitate the existing road infrastructure. Motorways and national highways are not more than 5% of the entire national road grid but, importantly, cater to 80% of the road traffic. At the same time, the question arises whether the past and present governments revised and updated the National Trucking Policy 2007, or implemented the National Transport Policy 2017-18, or took appropriate steps as per the National Freight and Logistics Policy 2020,” said Seatrade Group of Companies Chairman Muhammad Najib Balagamwalla.
“Every new minister or secretary has this penchant to extract dormant files and attempt to resurrect the files lying deep in the crypts of bureaucracy. The intention is usually unbiased and legal but the ramifications are rarely visualised nor comprehended seriously. The priorities are skewed, especially when the nation is still facing the strains of a difficult economy,” he said.
While fulminating against the ALR, Lasbela Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) President and Salt Manufacturers Association of Pakistan (SMAP) Founding Chairman Ismail Suttar said transportation cost of salt is more than its (salt) value. The authorities concerned raise this issue from time to time. Goods vehicles carry the same load of around 70 tonnes or above, but police enjoy a party while taking cuts and bribes throughout the way from the port to the destination in the country or vice versa.
He said the ALR should be ignored, if it is implemented strictly, there would be scarcity of food, as there are not ample goods vehicles in the country, estimated at just 350,000 vehicles.
“Implementing the ALR will require a fleet of more than double at around 700,000 goods vehicles forthwith, pushing up fuel consumption, tyres demand, pollution, vehicular traffic, trigger a new storm of inflation and above all vehicles cannot be imported overnight and the country will need millions of dollars to purchase them. Therefore, there is a need for a long-term policy to implement the ALR,” he said.
Leading auto expert and author of “Steering the Pakistani Wheel” Murtaza Mandviwala said the regulators have to reset their view on the automotive industry. “Affordable mobility of people and goods is critical for economic growth. Pakistan is left with road transport as the only form of mobility (having poor railroads, no waterways, a few airports and scarce mass transit).”
Meanwhile, sharing details of the ALR, the business leaders said approximately 350,000 units of various axle trucks are plying across the country with a majority of them being three-axle (10 wheelers) and six-axle (22 wheelers).
A trailer used to carry 55 tonnes to 80 tonnes of cargo and a highwall truck used to transport 30 tonnes of goods, but after implementation of the ALR, they are lifting 40 tonnes and 17 tonnes respectively.
Some of the users had to get a stay order from the Sindh High Court for Karachi only as there is no highway within the port city where goods vehicles can carry 55 tonnes and 30 tonnes, but vehicles going to the upcountry side have to follow the ALR of 40 tonnes and 17 tonnes respectively.

3,Hyperinflation and the mystery behind no protests,"Pervasive political, social uncertainty prevents people from taking independent action","In their latest survey, Gallup & Gilani Pakistan asked a nationally representative sample of adult men and women: “Compared to ten years ago, do you feel more financially prosperous, less prosperous, or indifferent?”
Surprisingly, 35% of respondents reported feeling financially better off now compared to 10 years ago.
In their responses, 14% of respondents felt ‘Very prosperous’, while 21% reported feeling ‘Somewhat prosperous’ (totalling 35%). Additionally, 16% indicated ‘No difference’, 29% expressed feeling ‘Somewhat less prosperous’, 15% noted feeling ‘Much less prosperous’, and 5% either did not know or did not respond.
This optimism is surprising, particularly considering the severe political and economic instability in Pakistan from 2014 to 2023. The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated social and economic challenges, disrupting global supply chains, which are still in the process of recovery.
Following the COVID-19 lockdowns, increased government spending, combined with other factors, triggered the worst-ever wave of inflation, affecting both developed and developing nations alike.
In Pakistan, the post-pandemic years witnessed a significant surge in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In 2020, inflation stood at 11.5%, rising to 12.3% in 2021. By 2022, the rate had jumped to 24.5%, further escalating to 29.7% in 2023.
In May 2023, it reached an all-time high rate of 37.97%. By January of this year, it had decreased to 28.34% from 29.66% in December 2023.
The Gallup survey reflects people’s beliefs. How do we reconcile the 14% (Very prosperous), 21% (Somewhat prosperous), and 16% (No difference) responses with the 29% (Somewhat less prosperous) and 15% (Much less prosperous) responses?
Read Govt striving to tame inflation: minister
The responses of the latter group, comprising 44%, align with the significant inflationary pressures eroding their purchasing power.
But what about the better-off lot, representing 35% of respondents? Here, a reality check is needed to assess the situation and contrast it with the expectations of economically and politically motivated commentators and analysts. They wonder why there is no unrest, why people aren’t taking to the streets, why there are no protests.
Here’s an explanation that considers the ground-level economic perspective.
Firstly, while there are economic and social issues that could potentially mobilise a segment of the population, no political party is willing to champion these causes. Their focus remains on power politics.
Secondly, pervasive political and social uncertainty prevents people from taking independent action.
Thirdly, the current political crisis has further complicated matters, causing widespread concern about the future and prioritising immediate well-being.
Most importantly, the Civil Economy serves as a buffer, allowing people to withstand the impact of hyperinflation. This resilience extends to coping with escalating electricity and gas prices.
What exactly is this Civil Economy? It’s the economy unfolding on the ground, in bustling streets, markets, humble homes, and narrow roads. Evidence supporting this abounds; take a stroll and observe it first-hand.
Undoubtedly, the lowest strata of the middle class have borne the brunt of unprecedented hyperinflation and continue to do so. However, their resilience shines through as they find ways to earn a living through innovative means. This adaptability is true entrepreneurship in action.
The true resource lies within the people themselves; they create and sustain their livelihoods, benefiting not only themselves but also others. This is their economy—the civil economy—that underpins society. In reality, it is the people who uphold the state economy by contributing taxes and supporting its functioning.
Therefore, it’s the civil economy that has empowered people to sustain themselves and endure hyperinflation. Without it, this resilience would not have been possible. Consider what would happen if there were no civil economy, or if its size were too small: coping with hyperinflation would be impossible.
Lesson learned: The civil economy is indeed a blessing. Let it prosper.

4,Overhauling Pakistan’s tax system,Rationalising taxation laws and broadening tax base should be priorities,"I A Mayburov (2007) defines the Tax System as ‘a system that is a principle-based integral unity of its main interconnected and interrelated elements. These elements are the regulatory legal basis of taxation, the set of taxes and fees, the payers of taxes and fees, and the mechanism of tax administration’. Considering these elements in relation to Pakistan’s tax system reveals the need for comprehensive overhaul. The budgeted revenue receipts for the fiscal year 2023-24 are Rs12.378 trillion, with tax revenue receipts budgeted at Rs9.415 trillion, constituting 76% of the total revenue receipts. Projections for fiscal years 2024-25 and 2025-26 anticipate increases in tax revenue, reflecting a strategy for growth. The challenge remains on achieving these targets, whether through traditional methods of taxing existing taxpayers or through a fundamental overhaul of the tax system. Success lies in the latter, with a focus on modernisation and efficiency.
The first priority should be the restructuring of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the backbone of the tax system, addressing issues like overstaffing and the quality of personnel. Many officers, burdened by revenue targets, conduct assessments and audits that often fail in appellate forums. Policy matters should not fall under the purview of tax administrators. Automation, given the advancements in Artificial Intelligence, needs emphasis over manual processes. Crucially, the FBR’s perception among taxpayers needs improvement to address trust deficits and encourage compliance. Considering the inactive status of many potential taxpayers, a single tax collection agency for all taxes in Pakistan could enhance efficiency and effectiveness in tax administration.
The focus should shift towards broadening the tax base, a long-standing issue with limited progress. As per the updated list of FBR pertaining to the active taxpayers for tax year 2023, the active taxpayers in income tax are 3,665,612, and in sales tax are 207,194. Despite efforts, the number of active taxpayers remains insufficient. Many register to evade higher rates but declare incomes below taxable thresholds. Efforts to identify non-filers have yielded limited results, despite existing data within the FBR. Corporations, including financial institutions, shoulder significant tax burdens, raising questions about equity and sectoral contributions to GDP. If we want to check the intent of the legislators in this area, we will have to check the measures they have taken to tax those sectors that contribute more towards GDP. Sectors like retail, agriculture, real estate, gold, foreign exchange and others largely evade targeted taxation. Imposing more taxes on existing taxpayers may drive more activity into the undocumented sector, discouraging compliance.
Rationalising taxation laws should be a priority. Tax laws are meant to simplify processes, yet in our country, they often add complexity. This complexity hampers economic goals and may deter investors. New provisions are introduced without considering potential litigation costs, such as cases related to Super tax on high-earning individuals or Capital Value Tax. Tax policies must offer consistency and stability to foster business growth and economic stability. Uncertainty discourages investment and impedes economic progress. Therefore, policymakers should ensure that tax laws are consistent and provide a conducive environment for businesses to thrive in the medium to long term.
Read Aurangzeb plans to bolster tax revenue by Rs2.5tr
In the fiscal year 2022-23, direct taxes constituted 32.33% of total revenue receipts, while indirect taxes made up 49.32%. For fiscal year 2023-24, the budget allocates 34.38% to direct taxes and 41.69% to indirect taxes. However, a closer look reveals that a significant portion of direct tax revenue is collected indirectly through advance and withholding taxes. Individuals with incomes below taxable thresholds are still subject to these taxes, leading to inefficiencies and delayed refunds. Simplifying the tax system by introducing flat rates for individuals and associations, akin to corporate taxes, could streamline processes. Implementing a single-digit sales tax rate without input tax allowances would reduce disputes and administrative burdens. Additionally, uniform provincial sales tax rates across provinces for similar services would eliminate competitive tax advantages, while resolving issues related to origination and destination would promote harmonisation.
According to Article 10A of the Constitution of Pakistan, every individual is entitled to a fair trial and due process. However, a fair trial becomes challenging when decision-makers lack independence. There’s a noticeable bias in decisions made by the Commissioner Appeals, especially when the FBR faces revenue shortfalls. Since this office falls under the FBR, independent judgment is compromised. This pressure then burdens the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR), which must handle matters that could have been resolved earlier with independence. One solution could be to abolish this appeal forum and expand ATIR benches. Furthermore, ATIR, currently under the Ministry of Law – and hence the federal government – lacks full independence. Placing ATIR under the Supreme Court of Pakistan for oversight and allowing appeals only to the Supreme Court would ensure swift and uniform decisions. This reform aligns with Article 25 of the Constitution, ensuring equality for all citizens.
It is concluded that overhauling the tax system of Pakistan requires sincere and consistent efforts in all the interconnected elements of the tax system. The outcome of the initiatives taken in this regard would reap the results for the ailing economy which would be sustainable in the long-term as compared to the fire-fighting measures that are usually taken under lenders pressure to achieve the revenue targets.
