0,"PTI asks ‘N’, PPP to table no-trust motion against Sanjrani",Former allies want PTI to initiate the move,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has urged the PML-N and PPP to move a no-trust motion against Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani if the two parties were really opposed to the passage of the resolution seeking to delay the general elections by the Senate. 
A ‘quorum-less’ Senate had passed the resolution that landed in the House out of the blue, with Senate chairman fully facilitating it.
“Why would we support postponement of elections?” PTI Senator Saifullah Abro asked while answering a question during a Dawn News show ‘Doosra Rukh’.
He said the PML-N had not released any statement against the delayed polls, and only one of its senators had spoken on the issue in the Senate. 

Former allies want PTI to initiate the move

On the other hand, Senator Abro said, the PPP had taken a stand. He said that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari was appearing on the media to assert that elections would take place on Feb 8. He also noted that Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan had submitted a fresh resolution, urging that polls should be conducted on time.
“So we will support elections taking place on Feb 8. We have been demanding for past one year that elections should take place,” Mr Abro said. 
He said that if the PML-N and PPP thought that the resolution seeking delay in polls was “wrong”, then the parties should bring forward a no-confidence motion against the Senate chairman and “the PTI will support it”. He said Chairman Sanjrani hardly had “seven to eight votes”.
He noted that there were only two months remaining for the tenure of the current Senate. “The way he has disrespected the Senate […] at least two months can be saved […] If they [PML-N and PPP] have the guts, then bring a motion against him.” 
N, PPP want PTI to initiate move
PML-N leader Senator Irfan Siddiqui, when contacted, said instead of giving advices through TV channels the PTI should take practical steps. He said the PTI should draft a no-trust motion and discuss with other political parties, explaining the reasons for the move around two months ahead of the expiry of Sanjrani’s term. He said once the PTI came up with a proposal, the PML-N would take a decision. 
However, a PPP leader, when contacted, suggested that the PTI move a no-confidence motion and said the PPP would support it. 
The PPP leader said an action against its senator who supported the resolution even before it was moved in the House had already been taken. “The PPP wants elections as per the schedule,” he remarked.

2,ECP ill-prepared for postal ballot exercise,Asif Hussain given additional charge as commission’s secretary.,"ISLAMABAD: Missing information on the Election Commission of Pakistan’s vote verification service has become a real headache for well over a million voters, eligible to cast their vote through postal ballots, with less than two weeks left to apply for the same. 
The election watchdog has fixed January 22 as the last date for receiving applications for postal ballot papers for general elections, but the details of the respective national and provincial assembly constituencies are still not available on its 8300 SMS service.
Applications for the postal ballot are to be made with the returning officer concerned of the constituency, which has not been updated on the service. 
The facility, under the law, has been exten­ded to the persons in government service, me­­m­bers of the armed forces, their wives and their children who reside outside their constituency.
Persons with any physical disability, who hold a national identity card with a logo for physical disability, can also vote via postal ballot. Prisoners are also entitled to vote by postal ballot. 

Asif Hussain given additional charge as commission’s secretary

The ECP in an attempt to justify the mistake of exposing the flaws in preparations for the gigantic electoral exercise said that the final publication of the list of polling stations is done 15 days before the elections and then voters can find their statistical link code, serial number, family number, provincial and national assembly constituency number, and the name of the polling station.
At present, it pointed out, the constituency-wise preliminary lists of polling stations have been published and voters can submit their objections and suggestions to the respective district returning officer (DRO) by January 11, and the DRO will decide on these objections by Jan 17.
The final publication of the lists of polling stations will be made 15 days before the elections. After publication, details of the voter’s data are provided on 8300 (SMS). It, however, failed to explain what the list of polling stations has to do with those intending to vote by postal ballot.
Those entitled to use the facility of postal ballot are interested in knowing their constituency numbers, which are determined by delimitation of constituencies and have no link with the list of polling stations. 
Meanwhile, the ECP assigned the additional charge of its secretary to Dr Syed Asif Hussain, one of the two special secretaries. According to a notification, Dr Asif Hussain has been assigned the additional charge of the secretary, with immediate effect and until further orders.
The ECP chose not to place the notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn, on its website, nor was it shared on a WhatsApp group for media being run by the commission’s media team, raising questions over transparency in the ECP.

3,"Courts may revisit verdicts if injustice proven, CJP observes in Bhutto case","Bilawal seeks timely decision, sees chance to rectify history.","ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa observed on Monday that by hearing the long-pending presidential reference — seeking to revisit the 1979 controversial death sentence awarded to former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (ZAB) — the Supreme Court is concerned with the repute of the person, posterity, history, and determining whether such an exercise sets a good precedence for future courts.
CJP, heading the nine-judge Supreme Court bench addressing the reference, explained that the court could revisit its earlier judgements if it is established that a great miscarriage of justice occurred due to the departure from Constitution or political elements in the prosecution.
 
 

But to do so, it has to establish the requirements of Article 4 of the Constitution, which ensures that the right of individuals should be dealt with in accordance with the law, CJP said.
When Article 4 cannot be suspended even if emergency was proclaimed or the Constitution was abrogated or put in abeyance, why a person should be prevented from approaching the Supreme Court on the grounds that the requirements of Article 4 were ignored.

Bilawal seeks timely decision, sees chance to rectify history

“Why the court should not revisit all the cases where such departures were made,” CJP questioned.
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah questioned if the court could revisit the judgement by relying on an interview of former CJP Dr Naseem Hasan Shah by journalist Iftikhar Ahmed, taking it at face value. In the interview, Dr Shah claimed that the conviction against Mr Bhutto was the result of pressure.
Justice Shah further questioned whether the court should not conduct a proper inquiry to conclude that injustice was done, especially when other members of the bench, that handed down the same conviction, have not come forward. He noted that it was only one judge who had given the interview.
Senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan, appointed amicus curiae by the court, said the present matter was a unique case in the common law jurisdiction where a judge, who was part of the narrowest majority of the bench, gave an interview much after his retirement.
The court postponed further hearing on the reference after the general elections.
Timely decision in ZAB case sought
In a relevant development, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed his desire for the decision to be announced before the polls.
 






In a news conference outside the Supreme Court building after the hearing, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said, “We demanded from the incumbent chief justice that the case must be concluded after the elections and not left on the back burner, as happened in the past when former CJ Iftikhar Chaudhry started the case and after two or three hearings, he forgot about it.”
The PPP chief stated that the judiciary has an opportunity to rectify history.
“The way this case [ZAB’s case] was decided, a precedent was set, and such injustice was repeated time and again. Today we have a chance to set right the history and close the doors of injustice forever.”
Taking a different stance from his previous speeches, where he aggressively criticised PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, Mr Bhutto-Zardari urged both PML-N and PTI to learn from their past mistakes to brighten the future for coming generations.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari expressed firm confidence that the next general elections would be held on schedule on Feb 8, as assured by CJP Isa.
Later, US Ambassador, Donald Blome, called on Mr Bhutto-Zardari at Zardari House.
 






Ac­­co­r­ding to the PPP central secretariat, both Mr Bhutto-Zardari and the US ambassador discussed the promotion of bilateral relations. They also exchanged views on ways to increase trade. PPP leader Farhatullah Babar and former Sindh CM Mur­ad Ali Shah were also present during the meeting.

5,PTI asks SC to take notice of Sunday’s internet disruption,"Telecom operators lament losses due to digital blackout on ""political grounds"".","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has urged the Supreme Court to take notice of the suspension of internet service and blockage of social media websites during the party’s fundraising telethon on Sunday.
Telecom operators have also expres­sed concern over frequent internet outages “on political grounds”.
In a statement, the PTI spokesperson alleged that 240 million people were deprived of their basic rights by the suspension, which also resulted in financial losses for the country.
“It is unfortunate that a political party is not being allowed to hold political activities. It is illegal to disturb digital activities and sabotage the electoral campaign,” the party spokesperson said.
“Such tactics cannot distance the people and PTI,” the spokesperson said, and demanded the Supreme Court hold accountable those “who became the reason for financial losses to the country”.
However, despite internet suspension, the party claimed to have raised tens of millions of rupees through donations. “After realising that the PTI has be­­c­ome the most popular political party in Pakistan, efforts are being made to turn the party’s victory into a defeat by political engineering and use of state power.”
 







Telecom operators lament losses due to digital blackout on ‘political grounds’

Sunday was the second time in recent months that internet services were disrupted as the PTI planned to host an on­­line event. On Dec 17, the party organised a virtual power show, which also suffered due to a disruption in internet services.
The Telecom Operators Association (TOA) has written a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) ex­­pressing concerns over the regular internet throttling “on political grounds”.
 
 

The letter by the TOA — an association of cellular mobile and fixed line operators — said the internet was apparently throttled on Sunday, leading to a degradation in user experience.
The impediments in access to digital and social media platforms and websites “was creating more harm than good in the long run”, said the TOA’s letter addressed to PTA Chairman retired Maj Gen Hafeezur Rehman.
TOA has requested the regulator to look into the matter and ensure that such disruptions do not take place in the future. “It is also our request that PTA issues a detailed clarification statement on what transpired and how it plans to prevent it from reoccurring in the future.”
The TOA added that the telecom sector supports the government’s initiatives to internationally position Pakistan as a key Information and communication te­­chnologies (ICT) hub to grow IT exports, attract foreign direct investment, and fast-track digital transformation.
However, censorship measures, “like the ones that were undertaken Sunday evening,” will severely undermine the government’s ICT-related growth ambitions and adversely impact Pakistan’s image internationally.
“[On Sunday], the websites and helplines of telecom operators were inundated with customers trying to find out what was going on,” the letter stated, adding that the operators had “no real answer”, further exacerbating consumers’ outcry and dissatisfaction.
In the current age, impediments in access to digital social media platforms or websites “were attempts in vain”.
Digital connectivity is a vital lifeline, and when severed, it impacts people, bu­­sinesses, and overall productivity and tarnishes the country’s image, TOA added.

6,US vows to boost Afghan refugees’ relocation,"In its statement to Con­gress, State Depart­m­e­­nt also expresses conce­rns about broader human rig­hts landscape in the region.","WASHINGTON: The US State Department has informed Congress of its commitment to enhancing its capacity to process applications of Afghan refugees stranded in Pakistan.
This initiative, which be­­g­an in July 2023 on a limi­ted scale, aims to address the plight of Afghan refug­e­­es seeking asylum in Pakistan.
“The State Department continues to work with Pakistan to expand that processing capacity,” said a statement sent to Congress earlier this week.
Tens of thousands of Afghans entered Pakistan after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban two years ago, seeking relocation to the US and to other destinations in the West.
The United States has so far considered 25,351 Afg­han nationals for pot­e­ntial resettlement, with 4,752 individuals already finding new homes in the country.
In its statement to Con­gress, the State Depart­m­e­­nt also expressed conce­rns about broader human rig­hts landscape in the region. 
The report claimed that the Saudi, Iran and Pakis­tan governments have been utilising blasphemy and defamation of religion laws to curtail religious freedom, restrict the rights of religious minorities, and limit freedom of expression. This has led to the imprisonment of individuals accused under these stringent laws, sparking international concern, it added.

7,SC judge withdraws objection to bench hearing his plea,Justice Naqvi faces complaints of misconduct before SJC.,"ISLAMABAD: Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi of the Supreme Court on Monday withdrew his earlier objection to a three-judge bench hearing his petition that challenged the issuance of a show-cause notice to him over alleged misconduct.
Makhdoom Ali Khan, the counsel for Justice Naqvi, told the apex court that the judge had not raised any objection to the jurisdiction or composition of the bench rather its constitution since it was not properly formed by a committee of three senior judges that constitutes benches, and he would prefer to advance his arguments purely on merit.
During the hearing, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, a member of the three-judge bench, had wondered how the present bench could proceed with the matter when it was no properly constituted.
 
 

Headed by Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan, the SC bench had taken up a set of petitions challenging the issuance of show-cause notice to Justice Naqvi who is facing complaints of misconduct before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
The counsel, however, withdrew the stand regarding objection to the constitution of the bench, saying the court should not make the complainants as party in the present case since their role as informers had ended after the filing of complaints in the SJC against the judge.

Justice Naqvi faces complaints of misconduct before SJC

The counsel contended that the information forwarded by the complainants before the council was entirely speculative in nature and, therefore, the notice should be withdrawn. He said the proceedings before the SJC were not being done on the instance of a reference by the president as earlier done in the case of former chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry or Justice Qazi Faez Isa, the incumbent CJP. The counsel said the information before the SJC could come from a newspaper article and television programmes.
“Will the court then require all the individuals to join the case as parties,” the counsel wondered, adding that the complainants in the present case did not have any locus standi to have any right in the matter.
The counsel said no notice by the council could be issued without conducting first proper factual inquiry.
The bench, however, postponed further proceedings till Tuesday to determine whether the court should also issue notices to the complainants.

8,FO rejects ‘Country of Concern’ status by US,ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Monday strongly rejected its designation by US as a ‘Country of ...,"ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Monday strongly rejected its designation by US as a ‘Country of Par­t­i­­cular Concern’ (CPC), labeling the assessment as “biased and arbitrary”.
In a statement, the FO said: “We categorically reject Pakistan’s designation as ‘a Country of Particular Concern’ by US State Department. We are deeply dismayed that the designation is based on biased and arbitrary assessment, detached from ground realities.”
On Jan 4, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken designated Pakistan, along with 11 other countries — Burma (Myanmar), the People’s Republic of China, Cuba, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Eritrea, Iran, Nicaragua, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan — as “Countries of Particular Concern” for engaging in or tolerating severe violations of religious freedom.
The State Department’s designations, updated annually, follow a review process as mandated by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. This Act requires an annual report on international religious freedom. Besides CPC, the other two designations are Special Watch List and Entities of Particular Concern.
The CPC designation, highlighting systemic and egregious violations, implies more than just naming and shaming. It can lead to a range of US actions, from diplomatic negotiations to sanctions, and places the designated countries under increased global scrutiny.
Pakistan, emphasising its diversity, stated: “In line with its Consti­tu­tion, Pakistan has undertaken wide-ranging measures to promote religious freedom and protect minority rights.”
The FO also expressed disappointment over the exclusion of India from the designation list. 
“We note with deep concern that India, the biggest and serial violator of religious freedom, has once again been excluded from US State Department’s designation list,” the statement read, adding that this omission raises serious questions about the credibility, transparency, and objectivity of the process.
The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), a bipartisan federal agency, has also expressed disappointment over the State Department’s failure to designate India as a ‘Country of Particular Concern’, despite meeting the criteria under US law.
USCIRF Chair Abraham Cooper and Vice Chair Frederick A. Davie have also criticised the decision.

About the treatment meted out to the Baloch protesters in the federal capital, they said that the participants in the long march were badly treated by the Islamabad police as hundreds of participants were arrested during the crackdown.
The protesters were released only after the intervention of courts, they said. “We want justice and recovery of our loved ones who have been missing for years. We have no other demand,” the leaders said.
