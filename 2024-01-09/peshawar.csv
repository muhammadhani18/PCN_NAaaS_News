0,Literati urged to write inspirational story books for children,Urdu book carrying 13 short stories launched,"PESHAWAR: Poets and writers have stressed the significance of producing quality and inspirational fables to fulfil the psychological needs of children.
Addressing the launching ceremony of a book, they said that material on children literature was scant in the market. They added that stories related in the textbooks lacked spirit to motivate children in the cultural environment they grew up.
The Urdu book titled ‘Kirnein’ by a young writer Raj Mohammad Afridi was formally launched here at Rana Academy Sikandarpura under the banner of Bazme Bahar-i- Adab Peshawar (BBAP). Poets, writers and intellectuals participated in the event and shared their critical thoughts on the book carrying around 13 stories for children in Urdu.
Written in fluent and easy-to-understand language, the book was printed under the auspices of National Book Foundation in August 2023.

Urdu book carrying 13 short stories launched

Octogenarian writer Iqbal Sikandar said on the occasion that authors with passion for writing for children should keep in mind local culture and psychical needs of their readers.
Prof Nasir Ali Syed commented that the new book comprising stories would motivate children to turn to reading habit instead of sticking to social media, which had morphed their creative strength. “Educationists in advanced countries have reverted to writing on the wooden slab and reading fables to connect them to their cultural roots,” he added.
Gul Arbab stated that need of the hour was to produce quality contents conveying lessons for building of overall personality of children. She said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ran short of authors writing for children. She added that Mr Afridi’s attempt would prove a milestone in that direction.
Fawad Anwar said that literati of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should come up with creative ideas to produce stories, fables and riddles for children in order to fire their imagination and also make them revive the tradition of storytelling.
Prof Khalid Suhail Malik on the occasion said that Raj Mohammad Afridi had brought out other publications including ‘Kunplien’ and ‘Kahani Ghar’ in Urdu related to children that showed his deep interest in the cause to contribute to children literature.
Azeem Niazi, Prof Dr Ishaq Wardag, Prof Malik Arshad Hussain and Tahir Hakeem Jilani also spoke at the event. A poetry recitation session was also held on the occasion.

A statement issued by the city police said that two other persons also sustained injuries in the firing.
It stated that the accused person dressed up as a lawyer entered the judicial complex to target his opponents. He started firing at his opponents, leaving a CTD cop martyred and three others, including a constable, injured.
“A member of CTD, Hujjatullah, embraced martyrdom and another police constable, Abi Saloom sustained injuries.

2,Quality of Peshawar’s air reaches ‘hazardous’ levels,Expert calls for elimination of pollution at source.,"PESHAWAR: With dense fog enveloping the capital and plain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for around a week, the quality of air in Peshawar reached “hazardous” levels in the last five days, point out the local air monitors.
The air quality index in the provincial capital reported a hazardous level for five days and very unhealthy for three days since Jan 1, according to the data of air monitors available on the website of the Swiss air quality technology company IQAir.
It showed that the capital’s AQI record for the particulate matter was 287 (very unhealthy) on Jan 1 and hazardous for the next three days.
The city’s particulate matter concentration was 356 on Jan 1, 331 on Jan 2 and 314 on Jan 3. However, the situation got a little better on Jan 5 and 6. The air quality improved with the particulate matter in the air dropping to the “very unhealthy level” but on Sunday and Monday, that concentration again surged to “hazardous level” recording 351 and 332, respectively.

Expert calls for elimination of pollution at source

The data of air quality monitors from the US Consulate Peshawar also recorded the consistent deterioration of air quality in the provincial capital fluctuating between very unhealthy, hazardous and very hazardous.
Dawar Hameed Butt, a climate policy specialist, told Dawn that cold weather prevented pollutants from dispersing and therefore, air quality deteriorated in cold, foggy conditions.
He said elimination of pollution at source could help improve air quality since it was what caused emissions to go to higher levels.
The Environmental Health Strategy, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 2015-19 – a study funded by the World Health Organisation and authored by Khyber Medical University Vice-Chancellor Prof Ziaul Haq – noted that KP faced several complex and difficult environmental health challenges.
“Some of these challenges are in common with the rest of the country such as water, sanitation, air quality and waste management while others were much more localised such as electronic waste, indoor air quality, environmental health in emergency and climate change.
There are several departments/agencies responsible for managing environmental risks and hazards, but none have the mandate of protecting human health from environmental health hazards. There is lack of coordination and collaboration between environmental and health departments and with other stakeholders,“ it read.
The study said the level of awareness of the linkage between environment and health was not up to the mark.
It added that there was very limited engagement of the health sector in motivating action by other sectors for health protection. Availability of evidence-based information in environmental health for sound policies and decision-making is extremely limited.
The study proposed the establishment of the Environmental Health Protection Unit (EHPU) at the health department to take the key role in linking health with the environment.
“The launching of the proposed EHPU may be a vital factor in implementing this strategy and may play a key role in protecting and promoting safer and healthier life in the province,” it said.
Referring to a report of the provincial environmental protection agency, the study said Peshawar was the province’s most polluted city with CO emission reaching 23ppm against 10ppm set by the World Health Organisation.
“In Peshawar, which borders Afghanistan, the large influx of Afghan transporters has greatly increased air pollution. Afghan refugees living for several years have also led to a greater demand for food, shelter, transportation and manufacturing activities affecting air quality,” it said.
The study said untreated industrial affluent, rural and urban sewage, agricultural, industrial and municipal wastes were released into rivers and open drains.
It said hazardous wastes could cause neurotoxicity, muscle weakness, loss of sensation, tremors, cognitive alterations and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and hepatitis A and B, Aids and typhoid.

Mr Ghani’s papers were rejected by returning officers for the two constituencies.
Relief for the PTI’s vice-president, who is currently in the United Kingdom, comes from the tribunal headed by Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Mr Ghani moved the tribunal through lawyer Naz Elahi Mughal. He filed nomination papers for NA-17 and PK-45 through his elder brother, Ilyas Ghani, after giving him a power of attorney.
Mr Ilyas was arrested in Abbottabad on the day he filed an appeal against the rejection of his brother’s nomination papers. However, the police freed him after the intervention of three lawyers.
Also in the day, Justice Faheem Wali of the Dera Ismail Khan election tribunal accepted the appeal of former federal minister and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur against the rejection of the nomination papers for NA-44, PK-112 and PK-113 constituencies.
Those papers were rejected by the returning officers in Dera Ismail Khan district insisting Mr Gandapur has been declared absconder in several criminal cases.
Lawyers Ghulam Mohammad Sappal and Adnan Khan Ghaznikhel appeared for the PTI leader before the one-member tribunal. Mr Ghaznikhel insisted that his client would contest the Feb 8 election in NA-44, PK-112 and PK-113.
Also, an election tribunal in the Mingora area of Swat district on Monday overturned the rejection of the nomination of Saeedullah, father of former federal minister and PTI leader Murad Saeed, for PK-8 constituency by the returning officer.
Also, Justice Mohammad Naeem Anwar of the tribunal directed Mr Murad to appear before him against the rejection of his nomination for NA-4.
The PTI’s Swat chapter said Mr Murad submitted his nomination papers for NA-4 to the returning officer through his lawyer, while his father, Saeedullah, filed his nomination papers for PK-8. They were rejected by the returning officers.
Also, nomination papers of 84 PTI candidates were also rejected by the relevant returning officers in Malakand Division.
However, the candidates formally approached the election tribunal in Mingora that accepted appeals against the rejection of around 60 nomination papers on Jan 5.
All other pleas were scheduled to be heard on Jan 8.

5,‘Vote for water’ drive becomes popular in Landi Kotal,Shortage of drinking water is considered a major issue in the area.,"KHYBER: As campaign for the February 8 general elections gradually gains momentum in parts of Khyber, some zealous youth in Landi Kotal have started an awareness drive about provision of drinking water in response to the demand for votes from the candidates for both provincial and National Assembly seats.
A pamphlet, vigorously circulating on the social media platforms and being distributed among locals, underscores the gravity of acute water shortage in most parts of Landi Kotal tehsil. It assures candidates of full support and maximum number of votes if they succeed in resolving this longstanding issue.
The slogan of the group ‘Paani Do, Vote Lo’ (give us water and take our vote) is gaining popularity among people as water shortage is considered a major problem by a large section of the local population.
Sharifullah Shinwari, a moving spirit behind this campaign, told this scribe hat his group was not against any political party or any independent candidate nor would it interrupt the voting process. However, it was exhorting all the candidates to fulfil the demand for provision of water, he added.
“Every house in our tehsil is hit hard by water shortage. Women have to bring water in buckets and pitchers from long distance in all types of weather conditions,” he said. He added that people also had to buy water from tankers on daily basis.

Shortage of drinking water is considered a major issue in the area

He regretted that several candidates had during the previous elections made false promises about overcoming the issue but reneged on their promises once they were elected to assemblies.
Boosting of a ‘widespread’ support from the cross sections of the society, Sharifullah, however, clarified that the group was totally apolitical and was running its awareness campaign from its own limited financial resources.
He said that with the underground water table depleting considerably in recent years, most of the tubewells and dug wells dried down with a need for finding long-term alternate sources of water.
Rabi Khan Afridi, another active member of the group, said that their group was interested in early completion of the much talked about Shalman Water Supply Scheme, which could cater to the needs of more than 80 per cent residents of Landi Kotal.
He alleged that both contesting candidates and winners in the previous elections used the scheme for gaining support of voters but then conveniently forgot their promises after the elections were over.
“We have started a campaign. We are holding meetings with locals at their hujras, mosques, markets and other public places to convey to them our message,” he said. He added that they also educated locals about the importance of voting process and the power of their votes.
Manzoor Shinwari, another organiser of the campaign, told this scribe that they were making good use of social media platform with a very positive and encouraging response from people.
He said that they also planned to include some educated women in the group to convey their message to local womenfolk as they were affected badly by shortage of water.

7,Tribunal to decide plea against Nawaz’s candidature today,Acceptance of his NA-15 nomination was challenged by PTI leader Swati,"MANSEHRA: The Abbottabad Election Appellate Tribunal will decide today (Tuesday) a plea of PTI Senator Azam Khan Swati for the disqualification of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif from contesting the Feb 8 election in NA-15 constituency here.
Mr Swati challenged the candidature of Mr Nawaz under Section 62(F) of the Constitution after NA-15 returning officer Hajrah Samee cleared the PML-N leader last month to stand in the upcoming polls.
Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel of the tribunal fixed Jan 9 (Tuesday) for declaring verdict after hearing arguments of Mr Swati’s counsel Sardar Basharat and Mr Nawaz’s lawyer Jehangir Jadoon.
Mr Basharat told reporters after hearing by the tribunal that the Supreme Court had barred Mr Nawaz in 2017 from holding any public office or contesting polls for his entire life under Section 62(f) of the Constitution.
He said the tribunal declared that it would decide Mr Swati’s appeal on Tuesday no matter what verdict the Supreme Court gave in the Nawaz eligibly case.

Acceptance of his NA-15 nomination was challenged by PTI leader Swati

Mr Basharat said the tribunal had already extended hearing into the case thrice in anticipation of the apex court’s ruling in the Nawaz eligibility case.
The NA-15 returning officer disqualified Mr Swati from contesting election from the constituency after Mr Nawaz’s son-in-law retired Captain Mohammad Safdar raised objections about his nomination papers. The decision was upheld by the election tribunal.
EX-MINISTER JOINS JUI-F: Former provincial minister Abrar Hussain alias Mohammad Iqbal on Monday announced the joining of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl.

JUI-F leader Maulana Nasir Mehmood, who was also present, said his party was fielding election candidates, who could win national and provincial assembly seats.
He said his party was also in contact with former PML-N MPA Mian Ziaur Rehman in a bid to rope him in.
“If our talks succeed, he will join our party and contest election in Mansehra’s PK-36 constituency. If that happens, our woman candidate, Saima Bibi, will withdraw her nomination in his support,” he said.
The JUI-F leader said his party was also holding parleys with the PPP for seat adjustment in Mansehra’s two national assembly constituencies.
“We have withdrawn our NA-14 candidate to support the PPP’s nominee and want them to reciprocate our move in NA-15 by withdrawing their candidate, Zargul Khan, in support of our leader Mufti Kifayatullah,” he said.

8,JI senator questions sending of warship to Red Sea,Senator Mushtaq Ahmed says Jamaat-i-Islami is contesting elections to get rid of American slavery.,"BATKHELA: Jamaat-i-Islami leader Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan has said that rulers should explain why navy warship has been sent to the Red Sea.
“If its purpose is to protect Israel from attacks by Yemeni and Houthi tribes, then we cannot allow it under any circumstances. It is a matter of shame for the Muslim Ummah,” he told a workers’ convention here.
He said that caretaker government should ensure free and fair elections on February 8 as per the decision of Election Commission of Pakistan and Supreme Court instead of making such decisions.
About the resolution presented in Senate regarding delay in elections, Senator Mushtaq said that the resolution had no legal status. He alleged that rulers had become robbers and extortionists.
He said that running away from polls at that stage was tantamount to leaving field to terrorists and helping them in accomplishing their objectives.
Jamaat-i-Islami candidate for NA-9 Maulana Jamaluddin and candidate for PK-23 Shahab Hussain also addressed the gathering. Thousands of workers of the party participated in the convention.
Senator Mushtaq said that Jamaat-i-Islami was contesting elections to get rid of American slavery. He urged people to vote for JI on the polling day. He alleged that some laws were not enacted for the welfare of poor people. 
He added that some laws provided protection to national criminals, thieves, robbers and looters.
He alleged that the caretaker government increased the price of gas by 193 per cent and put a heavy burden on people. 
“I am the only representative of Islam, therefore, during my speeches, the broadcast of government TV is being stopped. My voice is removed from the YouTube channel of Senate,” he alleged.
The JI leader said that government should provide a level playing field to all political parties in the coming elections. 
He added pushing a particular party against the wall would not be an election and people would not accept it in any case.

10,"Cultural invasions exposed Indus valley people to traumas, says expert","HARIPUR: The convergence of civilisations in the Indus valley altered the society’s psyche over a period of time,...","HARIPUR: The convergence of civilisations in the Indus valley altered the society’s psyche over a period of time, exposing the people of the region to different societal traumas.
This was pointed out by noted psychiatrist Dr Moadat Rana while speaking on ‘psychology of Pakistani people’ at the fortnightly programme of Lok Chaupal held at the Wake Fields in Khanpur here on Monday.
Scholars, poets, development and health practitioners were in attendance.
Dr Zafar Mirza, former special assistant to prime minister on health, and Ayaz Gul Kiyani moderated the session. 
Dr Rana has been awarded Sitara-i-Imtiaz, and is author of 12 books and over 70 research papers.
About the historical influences, culture and traits of the inhabitants of Indus valley, Dr Rana said there were four cultures having developed over a period of time, including Mesopotamia, Eurals and China, and the third was near the Nile River and the fourth biggest was in Indus valley. “The Harppa culture in this region has similarity with Mesopotamian culture,” he added.
He said the Khyber Pass was another link along the Arabian Sea from where Tibetan, Eurasian and Aryan influences converged in the Indus valley, which caused genetic confusions.
He said Indus valley was the amalgamation of different cultures and civilisations as it was invaded 200 times since 1,500BC. “When a house is invaded for loot and plunder after every 15-20 years the psyche of the inhabitants would ultimately be similar to what we are experiencing right now in this region,” he said.
Talking about the psyche of urban dwellers and their traumas, he said the increase of wealth in society had resulted in increased threats to the haves. “To get rid of their mental fears they turned towards art, music, dance, poetry,” he added.
He linked the political instabilities, wrong and fragmented interpretation of religion and social norms, different education systems, irritable behaviours and eating habits as the causes of trauma. “It creates emotional distress, anger, anguish and pain, leading to drug abuse,” he said, adding the lesser models of the society were unable to tolerate and face such situations. 
“When someone starts looking for refuge and harbours the criminal tendencies, they get satisfaction in rape and violence,” he noted.
Dr Rana said the prevailing uncertainty in the society, fear of losing assets and successes had developed rampant social pathology, post-traumatic stress disorders and paranoia secretiveness. He called such a situation as psychic tumour that the entire nation was suffering from, but was putting blame on others and living in a state of denial. He also said artificial lifestyles were one of the reasons of societal trauma.
Dr Rana said being able to get rid of one’s weaknesses could be nation’s strength.

11,Terrorists continue to target polio vaccinators in KP,A report says 109 people have been killed in such attacks since 2012,"PESHAWAR: Police guarding health workers during house-to-house vaccination campaigns continue to get killed by militants, who are opposed to polio immunisation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
So far, 109 people have been killed in polio-related incidents since 2012, according to a report, which puts the number of injuries suffered by policemen and polio workers at 162 during this period.
It said that a total of 13 people were kidnapped during vaccination drives. The total number of killed and injured remained 284, including 166 policemen, 87 health workers and 31 civilians. They included 255 men and 29 women.
The Monday’s incident in Bajaur tribal district saw six deaths in one go in polio-related improvised explosive device blast as well as 29 injuries, the highest ever in a single act of terrorism against the people involved in vaccination. The incident, the first of its kind in the current year, marks the list of endless series of killing of police and vaccinators.
Vaccinators continue to fall to bullets of unidentified assailants since long but not as aggressively as they had been since 2012. However, the year 2014 witnessed 17 deaths, highest in any year since 2012 during which seven people were murdered in Charsadda district whereas in 2013 and 2016, militants killed 13 people in both years.

A report says 109 people have been killed in such attacks since 2012

Peshawar, the provincial capital, accounted for six deaths. In 2019, 10 people became victims of the attacks by terrorists, who are allegedly opposing polio vaccination under the misconception that drops are designed by western countries to render the recipients infertile and cut down the population of Muslims.
Other argument advanced for vaccine hesitancy is that immunisation is not allowed in Islam before occurrence of the disease. In 2022, 12 people were killed, including three each in Mardan and Peshawar, due to the same reasons. However, the previous year remained relatively peaceful as only one death was recorded in a polio-related incident.
According to the report, Peshawar has registered 23 deaths since 2012, Charsadda 12, Swabi and Dera Ismail Khan 10 each, Bannu nine, Bajaur seven, Mardan six, Tank five, Mansehra and North Waziristan four each, Bannu and Buner three each, Lower Dir, Swat and Khyber two each and one person each was killed during anti-polio campaigns in South Waziristan, Nowshera, Kurram and Lakki Marwat.
In each house-to-house vaccination drive, health workers target more than 7.4 million children with the help of 35,000 teams but about 500,000 stay unvaccinated, posing threats to the government’s plan to make the province polio-free. In each effort, 50,000 security personnel are deployed to ensure safety of health workers and reach every child.
Experts say that the province has been struggling to access every child as only vaccination can make the province free of polio, a crippling childhood ailment, but security situation is standing in the way of eradicating the virus. On many occasions, the province has gone very close to eradicating the virus but terrorists have succeeded to hinder the eradication efforts.
They say that poliomyelitis is the only childhood diseases that can be permanently eradicated through vaccination. The disease has been wiped out from the whole world, except Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan, using the same vaccine. Pakistanis are facing travel bans due to the circulation of poliovirus back home and these difficulties would continue to haunt people as far as the virus exists.
Experts opine that huge money and human resources, being utilised for polio campaigns, could be diverted to tackling other childhood problems once polio is eradicated. Trained polio workers have played significant role in Covid-19 vaccination in the province and their services can be vital for dealing with other public health issues being faced by people.
