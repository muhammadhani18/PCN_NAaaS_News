0,Soaring crimes plague capital,LEAs fail to ensure safe public places despite extensive efforts,"The previous year weighed heavy on the residents of Islamabad, mirroring the difficulties faced in the preceding years as the capital police failed to curb crimes, despite having access to cutting-edge technology.
The city, equipped with over 2,200 cameras, 23 mobile cars with cameras mounted on them, 72 pickets at entry and exit points, newly formed dolphin police squads, and rigorous patrolling witnessed a surge in criminal activities.
Despite these efforts, citizens found themselves vulnerable to crimes, and incidents persisted day and night throughout the year.
Contrary to police assertions of dismantling organised networks, sources within the police department revealed that street crime in the federal capital reached alarming levels in 2023. Armed criminals operated freely in upscale sectors and suburban areas, with citizens falling victim to over 4,000 incidents throughout the year.
Apart from citizens, police officials also fell victim to street crimes. Regrettably, two police personnel were martyred in deadly attacks.
The grim statistics include 179 deaths and 2,729 street crime incidents in Islamabad.
Police sources highlighted the industrial area zone's prominence in street crimes, with 750 incidents, while the city zone led in car thefts with 380 incidents and secured the third position in overall street crimes with 400 incidents. Similarly, Saddar Zone ranked second in street crimes and house burglaries.
In the industrial area zone, 30 murders occurred alongside 750 cases of house robbery and vandalism, and 190 valuable vehicles were stolen by unknown thieves. The city zone witnessed 14 fatalities, 400 house thefts, and 280 car thefts, and Saddar Zone reported 43 deaths, nine house robberies, 615 street robberies, and 152 car thefts.

The Sohan zone experienced 45 fatalities, 710 house robberies, street crimes at gunpoint, and the theft of 121 vehicles. The rural zone reported 45 deaths, six armed robberies, 200 house robberies, street robberies, and the theft of 49 cars in 2023.
Operations SSP Malik Jameel Zafar was unavailable for comment, but a senior police officer on the condition of anonymity acknowledged the establishment of five new police stations and dolphin squads in response to the escalating crime.
When questioned, the officer attributed the rise in crime to the increasing population due to migration from other cities to Islamabad.
Other than street crimes, the residents of the federal capital also faced difficulties due to various political parties marching in the city throughout the year.
Subsequent actions by police and other law enforcement agencies also hampered citizens' right to free movement on various occasions.

3,Five of a family perish in attack,Assailants manage to escape after shooting victims in broad daylight,"At least five members of a family were killed and one was injured in broad daylight in Rawalpindi on Monday.
The tragic event unfolded within the jurisdiction of the Chountra police station when unknown assailants opened fire on individuals travelling in a car.
According to sources, the injured is said to be in critical condition.
The suspect managed to flee the scene after carrying out the attacks.
According to the police, the incident occurred at 8:34am in the Chakri Road area. The assailants ambushed the occupants of the car, resulting in the deaths of four individuals and injuries to two.
In the ambush, 46-year-old Muhammad Atif, 27-year-old Shuja Younis, and 8-year-old Anabiya lost their lives instantly. Three injured individuals were transported to Benazir Bhutto Hospital, where 12-year-old Tabinda Fatima succumbed to her injuries. The remaining two injured were receiving treatment at the hospital where one more succumbed to his injuries.
The police reported that the victims’ family members were en route to court for a murder case hearing when the assailants, including Naeem Sultan and Sher Ali, opened fire on them. Preliminary investigations suggest the incident stemmed from an old feud.
Taking note of the incident, CPO Syed Khalid Mahmood Hamdani directed SP Saddar Muhammad Nabeel to reach the scene promptly with a substantial police force and ensure the swift arrest of the accused. A significant police contingent arrived at the spot, securing the vehicle and collecting crucial evidence. A mobile forensic laboratory team was dispatched to aid the Chountra police in the investigation, gathering additional evidence, including bullet shells recovered from the crime scene.
A case has been registered against the accused.

A spokesperson for Rescue 1122 confirmed that rescue teams promptly responded to the shooting incident. The deceased and injured were transported to Benazir Bhutto Hospital, with three ambulances and other rescue vehicles involved in the operation. Post-mortem examinations were conducted, and the bodies were handed over to the relatives of the victims.
Expat killed, trader injured
Rawalpindi continues to witness a surge in street crime as bandits in police uniforms shot and killed an expatriate on his return from the UK and injured a local businessman in an upscale housing society near Rawat.
The first incident unfolded as suspects erected blockades on the Range Road within the limits of the Race Course police station and fatally shot Tasaruf Mehmood, hailing from Dhodial, Azad Kashmir.
The victim along with his six-year-old daughter, was en route to his in-laws in Dhok Chaudharyan after arriving at New Islamabad Airport from Britain.
The assailants, disguised as police officers, stopped the deceased and attempted to snatch his handbags. The situation escalated when Mehmood resisted and the armed robbers, indifferent to the presence of the innocent child in the car, opened fire, leaving Mehmood critically injured.
The attackers fled the scene with a bag containing foreign currency, valuables, and travel documents.
Rescue 1122 rushed the victim to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. Following the incident, the police initiated an investigation, collecting evidence from the crime scene. The police said closed-circuit TV cameras in the area are being scrutinised to trace and bring the culprits to justice.
This incident reflects a disturbing trend where criminals, donned in police uniforms, frequently target overseas Pakistanis arriving at the New Islamabad Airport. Despite the recurrent nature of such incidents, concerns have been raised about lack of attention from the authorities in addressing this security issue.
Within a few hours of the first incident, suspected criminals carried out a second mugging incident on Kashmir Road within the Cantt police station’s jurisdiction. Two motorcyclists, one wearing a police uniform and the other in plain clothes, intercepted a filling station cashier and his companion when they were going to the bank to deposit Rs2 million and escaped after snatching the cash.
According to sources, the suspects carried out a third robbery in a private housing society within the Rawat police station’s jurisdiction.
The bandits targeted a businessman and his partner and when they were on their way to the bank with Rs3 million in cash.
Wearing police uniforms, two motorcyclists stopped them, identifying themselves as police officers. Upon resistance, they opened fire on the victim and managed to escape after snatching a bag full of cash.

He identified red flags such as unexplained weight loss, chronic constipation, or traces of blood in urine, indicating the need for a more in-depth investigation into the underlying causes.
The medical expert recommended undergoing a colonoscopy test as part of a comprehensive examination of the intestines for individuals aged 50 and above. However, he acknowledged that barriers such as carelessness and a lack of resources often deter many from pursuing necessary diagnostic procedures.
Dr Abbasi expressed concern over premature attribution of urinary issues to haemorrhoids, leading individuals to self-medicate without diagnosis.

9,Rescue centre opens doors to stray animals,Aims to safeguard helpless creatures by offering a range of facilities,"Rawalpindi police have taken a significant step towards animal welfare by establishing an Animal Rescue Centre in the Gawalmandi neighbourhood of the garrison city.
The newly established centre aims to safeguard helpless animals by offering a range of facilities, including first aid services and a lost and found section for citizens. Themed “Protection of Speechless,” the centre enunciates the vulnerability of animals requiring care and protection in urban environments.
Established under the directives of the Rawalpindi CPO, the centre employs the veterinary doctor and rescue staff of the Rawalpindi police. Sub Inspector Dr Arsalan Rana, a qualified veterinary doctor, has been appointed as the in-charge of the Animal Rescue Centre.
Talking to The Express Tribune, focal person ASP Kainat Azhar highlighted the centre’s role in administering first aid to animals reported for abuse by citizens. “In the civilised societies, people as well as animals are taken care of,” she said. The facility also provides an avenue for citizens to adopt pets and report missing animals.
Veterinarian Dr Arslan Rana emphasised that the centre offers first aid for animal injuries, including dog bites, and features an operational theatre. “In the event of dog bites or animals in need of first aid, the facility also offers first aid assistance and the ability to report a missing pet,” he said.
For those interested in actively contributing to animal welfare, the Animal Rescue Centre allows citizens to join an internship programme by paying a nominal fee. The centre has also formed partnerships with other pet clinics to enhance its outreach.

Animal rights
On a broader note, renowned wildlife and animal behaviour expert, Dr Ijaz Ahmed, emphasised the imperative need to not just consider the well-being of animals as a moral obligation but as a fundamental right within our society.
He asserted that animals, like humans, experience pain and deserve to have their intrinsic rights acknowledged. In a call for a societal mindset shift, he urged the public to recognise the emotional capacity of animals and their right to coexist in human societies with dignity and respect.
“However, it’s disheartening to witness the widespread use of animals for entertainment, particularly in circuses and amusement parks,” he said.
Fading biodiversity
Expressing concern over the gradual disappearance of animal biodiversity in Pakistan, Dr Ahmed highlighted the alarming consequences of depleting jungle cover. As these natural habitats diminish, countless species face the threat of losing their homes.
He further said that the diminishing jungles also result in a decline in biodiversity, particularly affecting Pakistan's aquatic ecosystems. He emphasised the necessity of protecting aquatic animals, underscoring the importance of preserving their habitats for the benefit of future generations.
