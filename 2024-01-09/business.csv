0,Govt plans to activate $1.5 billion  uplift fund,State-owned company will provide another funding source for projects.,"ISLAMABAD: The caretaker government plans to get going Pakistan Development Fund Ltd (PDFL) — a $1.5 billion state-owned shell entity — to provide an alternative financing source to public sector development projects through divestment of government stakes in public sector and public-private partnerships (PPP).
The entity was created in June 2014 with inflows of $1.5bn financial support from Saudi Arabia amid then prevailing foreign exchange challenges but remained almost in the cold storage of the Ministry of Finance for almost a decade now as most of the time its board of directors comprised ex-officio members. 
The foreign funds so received were claimed to have been used for setting up of two LNG-based power plants — Balloki and Haveli Bahadur Shah — of over 1,220MW through National Power Parks Management Company Ltd (NPPCL) — a subsidiary of the Power Division.
Although a public limited company led by the Ministry of Finance, the company was also granted a non-banking financing company (NBFC) status to facilitate innovative financing sources for development projects and engage in “investment finance services, asset management services, corporate finance services, money market activities and capital market activities.

State-owned company will provide another funding source for projects

The finance ministry has now started the process of hiring a chief executive officer for PDFL to steer the entity towards formal operations and facilitate foreign investment, particularly from friendly countries, in selected high-worth projects and businesses in the country. The CEO would be hired initially for three years, extendable, to lead the development and implementation of PDFL corporate strategy, business plan and operational strategies besides overseeing the preparation of policy for project selections and credit approvals leading to project monitoring and evaluation.
The finance ministry expected the hiring process completed before the caretaker government transfers power to the elected government so that the entity is ready to take off immediately and provide a platform to all stakeholders including international lenders and the private sector and streamline initiatives relating to infrastructure financing and public-private partnerships.
The CEO-to-be would be responsible for regular interactions with multilateral and bilateral agencies, export credit agencies and other local and foreign financiers and investors and subsequently manage and administer business assets and services besides tapping funding sources.
The government last week notified guidelines on Fiscal Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (FCCL) for federal PPP projects to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of public infrastructure. 
According to the finance ministry, the FCCL guidelines primarily focus on managing long-term fiscal costs in PPPs, including direct and contingent liabilities extending throughout the project lifespan including highway tolls, health facilities and other infrastructure ventures where managing fiscal costs and contingent liabilities remain crucial for sustainable implementation while providing clarity of roadmap and financial picture.
The objective is to optimise the advantages of private sector participation while maintaining fiscal sustainability and achieving long-term infrastructure development goals.

1,Onion shoots to Rs240 per kg amid unbridled exports,Pakistani exporters continue cashing in on the Indian ban on onion exports.,"KARACHI: As Pakistani exporters continue cashing in on the situation that emerged after the Indian ban on onion exports, local consumers are taking the hit of an improvement in foreign exchange earnings by paying up to Rs240 per kg for the commodity in the domestic markets.
When India imposed a ban on Dec 8, 2023 till March 2024, local rates suddenly crawled up to Rs160-180 from Rs120-140 on intense buying by the exporters and since then the rates have continued to swell on thriving exports.  As a result, the already inflation-hit consumers are now paying heavy prices for the most sought-after commodity compared to other vegetables.
Retailers said that exporters are lifting even the limited arrival of Iranian and Kabul onion to tap the huge export demand.
India had banned exports after local prices more than doubled in the last three months owing to a drop in production. The prices are reportedly on a downward trajectory in Indian markets.
As foreign media reports are coming up that India may lift the ban after a drop in prices, Pakistani exporters are trying their best to avail this opportunity till India resumes its onion exports in the world market.
Retailers said massive hikes in prices are forcing many consumers to lift limited quantities as per their requirement as they are trying to manage their purchasing budget due to high rates of other vegetables and soaring utility bills.
Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market Super Highway President Haji Shahjehan said the wholesale rates of medium quality is Rs7,000 per 40kg while high-quality costs over Rs8,000 per 40kg.
He claimed that exporters are procuring high quality due to its size and demand in the Arab countries and Dubai.
When asked that many non-traditional foreign buyers are also purchasing Pakistani onion in the absence of Indian variety, he said there might not be direct exports from local exporters, but other countries’ buyers may be lifting onion from Dubai for onward shipments.
He said the Balochistan crop has almost come to an end while the country is dependent on supplies arriving from different areas of Sindh, which is also keeping pressure on the prices.
As onion enjoys a big share in overall vegetable exports along with potatoes, the data of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics revealed a jump in total vegetable exports to 64,285 tonnes in November 2023 from 49,842 tonnes in October 2023.

2,Rupee’s rise spurs dollar inflows,Surge in SBP’s reserves and positive IMF responses boost confidence.,"KARACHI: The regular appreciation of the rupee has compelled exporters to sell their dollars in the banking market, which has helped the exchange rate remain stable, said sources in the financial sector.
The financial sector also noted another confidence boost with hopes attached to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), as business delegations from Gulf countries have started visiting Pakistan to explore opportunities.
“The daily depreciation of the dollar is the root cause of selling dollars by exporters since even a 10 paisa [difference] matters for the huge inflows of export proceeds,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the inter-bank market.
The market also witnessed forward selling of dollars by exporters.

Surge in SBP’s reserves and positive IMF responses boost confidence

“Banks are confident that exporters are not holding their dollars for better returns,” added Mr Atif.
The surge in the State Bank of Pakistan’s rese­rves, positive responses from the IMF, and increasing hopes for a better result from SIFC have built confidence in the financial market.
“Business delegations from Gulf countries are visiting Pakistan, exploring opportunities for investments, which shows confidence in the newly formed SIFC. No decision of SIFC is challengeable in any courts in the country, which is another confidence-boosting situation for foreign investors,” said a known businessman who interacts with foreign business delegations.
He mentioned that corporate farming for foreign investors has started in Pakistan, with a number of blocks allocated for crop cultivation in Punjab and Balochistan. He said agriculture holds great attraction for foreign investors, particularly from Gulf countries.
Currency dealers in the open market stated that the exchange rate is stable, and there is no Hundi and Hawala transactions anymore.
When asked why the rupee is gaining against the dollar, the secretary general of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan, Zafar Paracha, replied that SBP’s increasing reserves of and the positive response from the IMF are supporting the local currency.
“The single exchange rate has produced good results and helped stabilise the exchange rate. If the crackdown against illegal currency business continues and smuggling is completely blocked, stability will remain intact,” said Mr Paracha.
He mentioned that the single exchange rate has enabled exchange companies to sell their maximum amount of dollars to the banks.
“We are selling $300 million to $350m per mon­th to banks,” said Mr Paracha. Even if the average mon­thly selling of dollars remains at $300m, the banking market would receive more than $3.5 billion at the end of the fiscal year.
Bankers stated that the massive decline in twin deficits, trade and current account deficits, is helping economic managers keep paying for debt servicing. The financial sector believes that the current account deficit would not exceed $4bn during this fiscal year FY24.

3,Stocks turn in gloomy performance,Increasing political noise on the holding of upcoming general elections has made investors opt to trim their equity positions by booking profit in selective stocks.,"KARACHI: The stock market started trading on a bullish note on the first day of the week but the growing political uncertainty and its likely fallouts triggered selling by some worried investors as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index closed in the red.
Topline Securities Ltd said the equities floated in both directions. Initially, the index made an intraday high of 555 points to 65,069 level. However, profit-taking at the aforesaid level compelled the benchmark index to lose earlier gains before recording an intraday low of 331 points to 64,184. 
Due to increasing political noise on the holding of upcoming general elections on Feb 8, investors opted to trim their equity positions by booking profit in selective stocks of banks, exploration and production, tech and OMC sectors.
Resultantly, United Bank Ltd, Pakistan Petro­le­um, Oil and Gas Develo­pment Company Ltd, TRG Pakistan Ltd and PSO lost 200 points, cumulatively.
On the flip side, Engro Corporation, Engro Fertili­sers Ltd and Dawood Hercules Corporation Ltd collectively added 269 points due to rejuvenated buying interest in them.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said pre-poll uncertainty ahead of the IMF board meeting, which is scheduled for Jan 11, on its first review under the $3bn Stand-By Arrangement did add to the investor nervousness.
Also, doubts were growing about a cut in the SBP policy rate in the wake of surging inflation and concerns for geo-political tensions played a catalyst role in the bearish close of the market.
The KSE-100 index closed at 64,237.03 points after losing 277.87 points or 0.43 per cent from the preceding session.

6,"Global cooperation on the decline since 2020, laments World Economic Forum","“The greatest challenges for our planet, societies and economies are not bound by borders,” says President Borge Brende.","ISLAMABAD: The World Economic Forum (WEF) launched on Monday the Global Cooperation Barometer to measure the state of global cooperation. The barometer indicates that global cooperation was resilient in multiple dimensions from 2012 until 2020 but overall cooperation declined by 2 per cent from 2020 to 2022.
The Global Cooperation Baro­meter, developed in collaboration with McKinsey and Company, uses 42 indicators to measure five pillars of global cooperation between 2012 and 2022: trade and capital; innovation and technology; climate and natural capital; health and wellness; and peace and security.
The barometer also indicates that global cooperation showed signs of strength during the years measured in pillars such as trade and capital, innovation and technology, and climate and natural capital. However, it also reflects the significant challenges the world has faced in the past three years, including reversals in global health cooperation and sharp increases in violent conflict, shown through declines in the barometer’s health and wellness and peace and security pillars.
“The greatest challenges — and the most promising opportunities — for our planet, societies and economies are not bound by borders, which means the only way to address them is through cooperation,” said WEF President Borge Brende. “What the barometer shows is that cooperation on many issues is possible, even in the midst of competition and confrontation. In other words, leaders can work together despite not seeing eye-to-eye on everything,” he said.
“It’s clear that on some dimensions the world has become increasingly divided, yet the barometer shows that when you look at the full picture, global cooperation has remained surprisingly robust over the last decade,” said Global Managing Partner, McKinsey & Company, Bob Sternfels. “We have seen progress in collaboration across multiple areas, with special cause for optimism on climate and nature and breakthroughs in frontier technologies that draw on global contributions to innovation,” he said.
Economic cooperation
The Global Cooperation Barometer’s accompanying report, also released on Monday, presents a series of recommendations for business and government leaders, including identifying opportunities to deepen public-private partnerships in areas where they have critical operations and shared interests like research and development, harmonised regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and emerging technology.
The report says “Today’s economy is in a fragile state, with growth expected to be well below the historical average, according to IMF. Revitalising trade will be crucial to strengthening the economic outlook ahead and boosting livelihoods. However, the IMF has raised alarms about the possibility of global fragmentation, which could shave off 7pc of global GDP.
Similarly, technological innovation is key to boosting currently sluggish productivity growth, with generative AI holding extraordinary potential — $2.6 trillion to $4.4tr in additional annual value across industries, as estimated by the McKinsey Global Institute. The only way to unlock this benefit and manage undesirable consequences is through global coordination.
