0,Fertiliser black marketing alleged,Farmers accuse local admin of failing to act against hoarders,"The local administration’s inaction has pushed farmers into buying urea fertiliser off the black market. The illegal sale of urea is on the rise, while administrative officers are taking advantage instead of redressing the plight of farmers.
The artificial shortage of fertiliser will affect the yield per acre of wheat in the district this season. Farmers have lashed out at the administration, terming the current fertiliser shortage across the district as artificial and alleging that the nexus of the district administration and agriculture officials with hoarders is exacerbating the crisis at a time when fertiliser is vital for their crops.
Farmers have complained to the media that urea is available on the black market for between Rs5,000 to Rs5,500 per sack, which is Rs1,500 more than the official government rates. The rate and tehsil administration and government officers and hoarders are involved in it, the farmers alleged.
Speaking to the Express Tribune, farmers accused the local administration of using the fertiliser crisis as a political weapon. The administration is allegedly supplying fertiliser on the recommendation of certain politicians belonging to a particular political party or by taking bribes. In this crisis, the local mafia, which is reportedly engaged in looting and profiteering, has the full support of the local officers, while farmers are being treated discriminately.
In response to hundreds of complaints regarding the issue, the district administration set up urea sale points at the tehsil level around two weeks ago. However, these points were shut-down within three days for reasons known only to the authorities.

Later, after negotiations with farmers’ organizations, stalls were set up across the district where urea was available at Rs4,000 per sack, around Rs500 more than the official rate. In view of the urgent need of urea for the crops, farmers agreed to buy fertiliser at this high rate, but after several days, the supply of fertiliser to these stalls was also suspended. 
One of the main reasons behind the urea crisis is said to be its low supply compared to the rising demand across the district. The situation has worsened due to alleged malpractice in the distribution of urea by the revenue and agriculture officials. An official, on condition of anonymity, told The Express Tribune that the assistant director of the agriculture department, Falak Sher, is reportedly working with the hoarder mafia and making money by illegally selling fertiliser.
A farmer shared a video, in which fertiliser was secretly being stocked in a warehouse during the day time, while fertiliser is supposed to be stocked under the supervision of the Agriculture department and District Administration.
According to sources, several private individuals are taking slips of 50 to 100 sacks the from Assistant Commissioner's Office and Assistant Director of Agriculture Falak Sher on a daily basis and extracting this urea fertiliser, creating artificial inflation in the market. In this way, instead of giving relief to the poor farmers, artificial inflation is being created. There is a fear of hampered wheat production in the district due to the shortage and alleged malpractice at the hands of the local administration.

2,Tractor drivers trained through simulation,"Workshop participants experience driving in rain, sunlight and low visibility","The Agriculture Mechanisation Research Institute (AMRI) on Monday organised a training workshop on tractor simulation to provide maximum awareness to drivers about various operations.
A simulator is a computer-based system designed to replicate the operation of a tractor in a simulated environment. It utilises technology such as computer graphics and motion sensors to create a realistic experience for users. 
The tractor simulators are used for training in developed countries, where the drivers learn essential skills in a controlled virtual setting. 
The drivers learn steering, gear shifting, clutch control and braking, providing a safe and effective way to train individuals before they operate tractors in the field.
South Punjab Agriculture (Admin) Additional Secretary Aasif Raza, who was a special guest on the occasion, emphasised that learning the basics of tractor operation through a simulator is a secure way for drivers to gain proficiency without the risk of accidents. The tractor training simulator offers new and experienced drivers the opportunity to learn the skills of driving in a simulated real-farm environment.
Additional Director General Amir Shahzad highlighted that the use of modern techniques, computer graphics and motion sensors creates a realistic environment that replicates fields, roads and obstacles. 
Drivers could experience driving in various conditions like rain, sunlight and low visibility. 
Shahzad said students could learn at their own pace and practise repeatedly until they felt confident.

5,Schoolkids spared early morning chills,"Govt revises timings due to cold weather, fog","As the schools in Punjab are set to reopen after three-week winter vacations, the provincial government has revised the timings of the educational institutions in view of the prevailing severe cold weather.
According to the new schedule, schools across Punjab will open at 9:30am. 
The boys’ schools will close as 2:30pm and girls 2:15pm. 
The schools will reopen on Wednesday after extended winter vacations. The government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa had also delayed the opening time of the schools because of the harsh weather conditions.
However, according to sources in the Punjab Schools Education Department, the announced opening time is final, but discussions in connection with the closing time of 2:30pm were still under way. 
Before the winter vacations, the school timings in the province were 8:30am to 2:15pm. 
However, the timing has been revised because of the persisting cold weather and sense fog blanketing vast areas.
However, a representative of a teachers’ union expressed concern over the long school timings proposed for young schoolchildren.
""The harsh winter is badly affecting the people and children as young as four years of age will be forced to stay in schools for a long time.

He suggested that the provincial government should not reopen the schools at this time tor the early grades because the weather was dangerous for them.
He agreed with the timing for students of classes higher than the primary level. 
The teacher said the plight and risk to the young children should be paid special attention by the authorities concerned.
According to officials, the new timetable of the schools will be implemented from January 10 to 22 and the timings would likely be revised afterwards.

6,"Nawaz vindicated, injustice discarded, asserts Marriyum",Hails Supreme Court decision on lifetime disqualification,"PML-N Central Information Secretary and former federal minister for information and broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb has hailed the decision of the Supreme Court over lifetime disqualification as a step towards restoration of constitutional sanity.
History has vindicated Nawaz Sharif and restored his honour, while Saqib Nisar’s short-lived vengeful act has been dishonourably discarded, she stated. 
In a statement, Marriyum said the decision by the Supreme Court re-establishes the supremacy of the constitution. 
She said that the provision of lifetime disqualification was an instrument created for one reason and one agenda to persecute and exclude PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif from Pakistani politics forever. 
The architects of this sinister provision in the law should be held accountable for adulterating the constitution of Pakistan, which was the highest level of offence in the Islamic republic, she said.

The former federal minister said let this be a lesson for everyone now and in the future, that the true representatives of the people of Pakistan who are blessed with unshakeable love and support of the nation, cannot be eliminated from the political landscape because of the wishes and conspiratorial nefarious designs of a few individuals. 
Marriyum stressed that stringent consequences need to be defined to ensure that nobody should ever dare abrogate the constitution of Pakistan for political gains. She said that this principle of constitutional sanctity and sanity did not only apply to Nawaz Sharif, but should stand for all patriotic political leaders of Pakistan. 
Only the people of Pakistan have the power through their vote to qualify or disqualify their representatives, she concluded.
