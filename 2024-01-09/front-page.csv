0,"Court freezes properties of Malik Riaz, PTI leaders in £190m case","Others include Shahzad Akbar, Zulfi Bukhari, Farhat Shahzadi.","ISLAMABAD: An Isla­m­abad accountability court on Monday froze properties of five accused, including property tycoon Malik Riaz and his son, who have been declared proclaimed offenders in a 190 million-pound corruption case.
The accountability judge, Mohammad Bashir, issued orders to freeze movable and immovable properties of Mr Riaz and his son, Ahmed Ali Riaz; aides to former prime minister Zulfi Bukhari and Mirza Shahzad Akbar; Farhat Shahzadi aka Farah Khan; and a lawyer, Ziaul Mustafa Nasim.
 
 

Their perpetual arrest warrants were also issued.
The court has ordered revenue officers across the country to seize the offenders’ immovable properties. The excise and taxation officers have been ordered to confiscate vehicles registered in their names.
Commercial banks have been directed to freeze their accounts and not allow transactions or withdrawals.
The judge also appointed an additional director of NAB as a “receiver” to collect rental income from the properties owned by these suspects.
When the case proceedings resumed on Monday, the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) prosecution team, headed by Sardar Muzaffar Khan Abbasi, shared a copy of the reference with the counsel for Mr Khan.
Since Bushra Bibi, the spouse of former prime minister Imran Khan, didn’t appear before the court, the judge warned her of issuing non-bailable warrants.
The former prime minister and his spouse have also been nominated as accused in this reference filed by NAB.
The prosecution also submitted the details of movable and immovable properties owned by the suspects, as the judge invoked Section 88 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The said section authorises a court to order attachment — the process of seizing properties — when an accused has been declared a proclaimed offender.
On Jan 6, Mr Riaz, the property tycoon, made a last-ditch effort to avert the confiscation of his properties when he filed an application seeking suspension of his arrest warrants.
In his application filed before the court, Mr Riaz stated that he was not aware of the proceedings initiated against him as he was abroad. He added that he had recently learned about the case and wanted to join the proceedings.
The judge, however, dismissed the application and refused to suspend the arrest warrants.

1,Six cops on polio duty martyred in Bajaur attack,Soldier martyred in North Waziristan clash; anti-polio campaign put off in Mamond tehsil.,"BAJAUR / PESHAWAR: Six cops and a soldier embraced martyrdom in two acts of terrorism in Bajaur and North Waziristan districts on Monday.
An explosive device targeted a vehicle carrying police personnel for escorting polio vaccinators in Mamond tehsil, leaving six cops dead and 28 others wounded.
Police and Rescue 1122 officials said the blast occurred at about 9am in the Billoot area, some 24km northwest of Khar, the headquarters of Bajaur district.
In North Waziristan, a soldier lost his life while an injured militant was arrested following an exchange of fire between security forces and militants.
 
 

The truck carrying cops from the police line for deploying them to perform duty with vaccinators on the first day of the anti-polio campaign was hit by a roadside improvised explosive device in the Billoot area, DPO Kashif Zulfiqar confirmed while talking to reporters.

Five policemen died on the spot while another one succumbed to injuries at a hospital in Peshawar, police spokesman Israr Khan told Dawn.
Soon after the explosion police and security personnel rushed to the area to trace those involved in the attack.
Rescue 1122 ambulances transported the wounded to the district headquarters hospital Khar where emergency was already declared. Scores of the area residents instantly reached the hospital to donate blood for the wounded.
Senior officials of the hospital and Rescue 1122 told Dawn that some of the personnel were later referred to hospitals in Peshawar owing to their precious condition.

2,"SC verdict clears election path for Nawaz, Tareen","Court overturns lifetime ban on lawmakers, says Article 62(1)(f) not ""self-executory"" provision.","• Court overturns lifetime ban on lawmakers, says Article 62(1)(f) not ‘self-executory’ provision
• Justice Afridi disagrees, says conclusion drawn in 2018 judgement ‘legally valid’
• PML-N, IPP hail verdict; Marriyum links it with ‘constitutional supremacy’
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday scrapped its 2018 judgement by a majority of six to one, which had permanently shut the doors of parliament for lawmakers disqualified under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution for not being ‘honest and righteous’.
The majority judgement announced by Chief Jus­t­ice Qazi Faez Isa at 5:15pm explained that the interpretation of Article 62(1)(f) slapping a life ban — as taken in the 2018 Samiu­l­lah Baloch case — was beyond the scope of the article itself since the provision was not self-executory.
The seven-judge bench comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Yahya Afridi, Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, and Justice Musarrat Hilali had taken up a number of appeals moved by the appellants who were disqualified from contesting the elections or their nomination papers were rejected.
The court had taken up the matter to determine whether the disqualification for life under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution as commanded earlier in the 2018 Samiullah Baloch case will prevail or the 2023 amendments in the Elections Act 2017 that reduced the ineligibility period to five years only.
 
 

With elections just round the corner, the judgement also rejuvenated the hopes of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for his return to the election arena after being disqualified in the Panama Papers leak case on July 28, 2017.
Similarly, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) pat­ron Jahangir Khan Tar­een, who was disqualified under Article 62(1)(f) on Dec 15, 2017, by the Sup­reme Court in the Hanif Abbasi case, will also be able to contest the polls.
Former additional attorney general (AAG) Tariq Mehmood Khokhar was quick to respond to the short order by describing it as “constitutional relativism”. “Our history is replete with bending moments when we bend our jurisprudence to redefine justice,” the former AAG said.
“I fear time is propitious for pick and choose: who should be accountable and who should not be accountable,” Tariq Khokhar said, adding he would not comment on the merits of the case, but mused on the “allure of raw power”.
The judgement explai­ned the interpretation of Article 62(1)(f) in imposing a lifetime disqualification upon a person through an implied declaration of a court of civil jurisdiction while adjudicating upon some civil rights and obligations of the parties was beyond the scope of the said article and amounted to reading into the Constitution.
Justice Yayha Afridi, ho­w­ever, disagreed with the judgement, saying the extent of the lack of qualification of a member of the parliament, as envisaged under Article 62(1)(f) was nei­ther lifelong nor permanent and the same will re­main effective only during the period the declaration made by a court of law remains in force. “Therefore, the conclusion so drawn by the 2018 Supreme Court was legal­­ly valid, hence affirmed.”
‘Not a self-executory provision’
When the bench assembled in the evening to announce the verdict, the chief justice explained the court wanted to finish the matter since the election schedule had been announced.
 
 

The detailed reasons of the majority as well as the minority judgments will come later.
The judgement said Article 62(1)(f) was not a self-executory provision as it does not by itself specify the court of law that was to make the declaration mentioned therein nor does it provide for any procedure for making any period for disqualification incurred by such declaration.
Likewise, no law provides for the procedure, process and identification of the court of law for making the declaration mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) and the duration of such a declaration, for the purpose of disqualification, to meet the requirements of the fundamental right to a fair trial and due process guaranteed by Article 10A of the Constitution.
The bench explained the reading into the Constitution was against the principle of harmonious interpretation of the provisions of the Constitution as it abridges the fundamental right of citizens to contest elections and vote for a candidate of their choice enshrined in Article 17 of the Constitution in the absence of reasonable restrictions imposed by law.
Until a law is enacted, the short order said, to make its provisions executory, Article 62(1)(f) stands on a similar footing as Article 62(1)(d), (e) and (g), and serves as a guideline for the voters in exercising their right to vote.
Article 62(1)(d) spells out the qualification of the lawmakers by stating he should be of good character and was not commonly known as one who violates Islamic injunctions.
Likewise, Article 62(1)(e) says the candidate must have adequate knowledge of Islamic teachings and practice obligatory duties prescribed by Islam as well as abstain from major sins, while under Article 62(1)(g) a person has not worked against the integrity of the country or opposed the ideology of Pakistan.
Since Section 232(2) added in the Elections Act, 2017, vide the Elections (Amendment) Act, 2023 on June 26, 2023, was already in the field and was not challenged, therefore there was no need to examine its validity and scope in the present case. Section 232(2) prescribes five years of disqualification under Article 62(1)(f).
The Supreme Court also allowed the withdrawal of a 2022 petition moved under Article 184(3) of the Constitution by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA).
The petition was under objection and was not numbered.
Decision hailed
The decision of the top court was lauded by the IPP and the PML-N.
“History has vindicated former premier Nawaz Sharif and restored his honour, while former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar’s short-lived vengeful act has been discarded,” PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said in a statement on Monday.
 






She said the decision by the apex court re-established the supremacy of the Constitution.
“The architects of this sinister provision in the law should be held accountable for adulterating the Constitution…,” she said.
“Only the people of Pakistan had the power through their vote to qualify or disqualify their representatives,” the former minister declared.
IPP President Aleem Khan congratulated PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif and IPP leader Jahangir Khan Tareen for being able to participate in national politics in light of the judgement.

3,Kabul asks Pakistan to ‘stop being cruel’ to refugees,Acting PM of the Afghan Taliban regime says visit would help strengthen positive relations between the two countries.,"PESHAWAR: Calling on the Pakistani authorities to end their “cruel attitude” towards Afghan refugees, Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund, the acting prime minister of the Afghan Taliban regime, on Monday said such an attitude only exacerbated frustration and opposition.
“Such attitudes do not resolve issues,” Mr Akhund said, while talking to a delegation led by JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman at the Presidential Palace in Kabul, according to a statement released by the Taliban regime’s media department.
Mullah Akhund said the ‘Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan’ had no intention of causing harm to Pakistan or any other country for that matter, nor would it allow anyone to use the Afghan soil against any country.
The meeting was atten­ded, among others, by Chief Justice of Afghan­istan Maulavi Abdul Hak­eem Haqqani and acting Foreign Minister Maulavi Ameer Khan Muttaqi.
 
 

Welcoming the delegation, Mullah Akhund said the visit would help strengthen positive relations between the two countries.
Maulana Fazl is leading a nine-member delegation to the Afghan capital at the invitation of the Afghan Taliban to help arrest the deteriorating relationship between the two countries and put ties back on track.
Pakistan accuses the Afghan Taliban of sheltering the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Paki­stan (TTP). The Afghan Taliban deny this and have instead urged Pakistan to look inward and address its own internal security challenges.
Islamabad says the TTP has ratcheted up attacks inside Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban came to power in August 2021.
At a news conference last week, the Afghan defence minister alleged that ISKP (Islamic State-Khorasan Prov­ince) militants were operating from Pakistan to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.
The Pakistan government’s decision to deport nearly half a million undocumented Afghans caused further fissures in the already strained relations between the two sides, prompting Kabul to accuse Islamabad of leveraging the refugees issue as pressure and coercive tool.
During the meeting, FM Muttaqi raised the issue of treatment meted out to Afghan refugees and hurdles created by the Pakistani authorities in the transit trade and exports which, he said, was causing huge losses to the Afghan traders.
He stressed that bilateral trade should not be subservient to political issues between the two countries.
Speaking on the occasion, Maulana Fazl said the purpose of his visit was to remove misunderstanding and explore ways to enhance cooperation between the two countries in political, economic and trade spheres.
 






He said his party had opposed the treatment meted out to the Afghan refugees in Pakistan and asserted that such an attitude was the root cause of the problem between the two sides. “We have come here with a message of goodwill and we hope that this visit would yield positive results,” he added.
Government officials say the JUI-F leader was sufficiently sansitised on Pakistan’s key concerns vis-à-vis the TTP’s presence in Afghanistan and the freedom of action and movement that the banned outfit enjoyed under the ‘IEA’ patronage.
The Afghan Taliban statement did not make any reference to this contentious issue and only obliquely referred to the oft-repeated statement of the Taliban regime that it would not allow anyone to use the Afghan soil against any country.
It was not clear from the statement whether the JUI-F chief raised the issue at the meeting or what the response was from his Afghan hosts.
It was also not clear whether Maulana Fazl would have any contact with the leadership of the banned militant outfits on the sidelines of his meetings with the Afghan Taliban leadership.

4,"AI used to write Economist piece, claims Imran","Incarcerated PTI founder ""owns"" article’s contents; SC asks party’s lawyers not to accuse ECP without proof.","ISLAMABAD: Embattled PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan made a surprising claim, saying that an essay recently published by The Economist under his name was actually “AI-generated”.
Mr Khan made the claim while talking to journalists allowed to cover proceedings inside the prison after attending two trials — one regarding a £190 million corruption case and the Toshakhana reference — at the Adiala Jail, on Monday.
Confirming the contents of the essay, Mr Khan said he did not write the piece himself, rather it was based on points he had dictated, which were put into words through the use of artificial intelligence.
In the essay attributed to him, Mr Khan had expressed apprehensions that the election scheduled for Feb 8 may not take place at all, adding that even if they do, such polls would be a “disaster and a farce since PTI is being denied its basic right to campaign”.
Although the content and tone of the article were in line with Mr Khan’s historic stance, several observers had doubts over whether the PTI founder had personally penned the piece.

Incarcerated PTI founder ‘owns’ article’s contents; SC asks party’s lawyers not to accuse ECP without proof

“It is not an issue that someone cannot write an article or a book while languishing in jail. We have the objection that the article in question has not been written by the former PTI chairman,” APP quoted caretaker Information Minister Murtaza Solangi as saying on Monday.
The minister said no such content was leaked from the jail to any media organisation and alleged that The Economist published “the ghost article” in the name of the former PTI chairman.
When asked about the provenance of the article, sources close to Mr Khan told Dawn that it contained facts mentioned by the PTI founder at different points in time, adding that the article was merely a consolidation of facts already available on social media platforms.
The sources said that Mr Khan had shared these details with some visitors who met him in prison, and they may have confided them to someone in the magazine, who consolidated these facts into the shape of an article.
Although AI-based programmes such as ChatGPT can be used to write articles, digital rights expert Usama Khilji expressed a degree of doubt over Mr Khan’s claim.
“Whether it was written as is by Imran Khan, AI was used based on his notes, or [it] was edited by his close aides is not as important as the substance of the article,” he said, adding that artificial intelligence was a tool that could be used to aid writing.
Since the article was first published on Thursday, it has been reposted at least seven times from the publication’s official X account. The posts have over 25 million views.
 






PTI’s social media team, meanwhile, has used replies under publication’s posts to put forth its narrative on the purge faced by the party. Several PTI supporters, including the party’s official account, have shared videos containing claims of an assassination attempt on Mr Khan’s life, alleged human rights violations and the persecution of party’s workers and leaders.
Level playing field
Separately, during the hearing of a petition seeking a level playing field for polls at the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) told the bench, headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, that the commission had accepted 598 out of a total of 843 nomination papers filed by PTI candidates for the National Assembly, while 1,398 out of 1,777 candidatures had been cleared for the provincial assemblies.
 
 

During the hearing, CJP Isa asked the PTI’s lawyers not to hurl allegations at the ECP without any proof.
PTI’s counsel Latif Khosa and Shuaib Shaheen said that their candidates were rounded up under Maintenance of Public Order and claimed that the PTI was not being given a level playing field.
They also pointed out that the ECP deprived the party of its iconic symbol and requested the restoration of the bat symbol.
The apex court has scheduled the hearing for PTI’s petition on Jan 11.
