0,Missing persons bill ‘never went missing’,"Senate Secretariat says the bill was returned to National Assembly after being passed with 
some amendments","ISLAMABAD: The Senate Secretariat on Monday claimed that the bill on missing persons never went “missing and was not pending with it”. 
In a statement, it said the bill was “returned to the National Assembly” after being passed by the upper house of parliament with some amendments. 
The Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2021, seeking to criminalise “enforced disappearance” was piloted by the then Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed and was passed by the National Assembly on Nov 8, 2021.
In January 2022, the then human rights minister Shireen Mazari had alleged that the bill had gone “missing” after it was sent to the Senate. 
Later, Ms Mazari had also claimed that she was asked to appear at the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) headquarters over the bill. She had added that after the bill was tabled in the NA, it was referred to the interior committee where “invisible shadows” tried to change the clauses. She had regretted that the bill “disappeared” on the way to the Senate.
The issue of the “missing” bill surfaced during the hearing of a case pertaining to “enforced disappearances” taken up by the Supreme Court on January 2. Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa had expressed surprise over the disappearance of the bill from the Senate.

  some amendments

“It is strange that a minister is saying her bill disappeared,” Justice Isa had remarked noting that a serious allegation had been levelled against Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani.
In a statement issued here on Monday, the Senate Secretariat, while referring to the Supreme Court’s Jan 2 hearing, said a reference was made to the bill “which originated in the National Assembly but presumably vanished when it was transmitted to Senate”. Moreover, it was claimed that the efforts of the federal minister to get the said bill passed were thwarted by the Senate chairman. It, however, said the Supreme Court rightly noted that it would not be appropriate to attend to the allegations made against the Senate chairman.
“Still, a false impression was created in the media that the bill actually went missing and Senate chairman or Senate Secretariat had a role in it,” it noted. The Senate Secretariat said that the “preposterous of the bill vanishing or alleged interference” by the chairman was contradicted by factual details. It recalled that the said bill was introduced by the then interior minister in the National Assembly on Jan 7, 2021, and was passed by the lower house of the parliament on Nov 8, 2021.
It said as per constitution and legal requirements, the bill was sent to the Senate on Nov 10, 2021. The bill was tabled in the Senate on July 29, 2022, the Secretariat stated, adding that it was the prerogative of the government to decide the timing of the tabling of a bill in the House by placing it on the proposal for the orders of the day provided by the ministry of parliamentary affair. “Senate is not mandated to bring a government bill on the agenda on its own,” it said.
“After tabling in the house, the bill was referred to the standing committee for consideration and report,” the Senate Secretariat said. 
“The bill was passed by the Senate on October 20, 2022, with some amendments,” it added. “Accordingly, in pursuance of clause (2) of Article 70 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, and rule 125 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, the bill was returned to the originating House, i.e. the National Assembly of Pakistan on October 20, 2022.”
It concluded that the factual position “enunciates that the subject bill was never missing, is not pending in the Senate Secretariat, rather has been returned to the National Assembly after passage in the Senate, as required by the Constitution and rules of the Senate”. The fact of the matter, however, is that the bill had been passed by the National Assembly once again on October 21, 2022, a day after the Senate passed it with amendments and returned to it, after removing a controversial section providing for punishment to those filing false complaints.
The omitted section stated that “whoever files a complaint or gives information that proves to be false he or another person has been subjected to enforced, forced or involuntary disappearance, or an attempt has been made in this regard, shall be guilty of an offence punishable up to five-year imprisonment and fine of up to Rs100,000”. After the passage of the bill by the National Assembly with amendment, the Senate has required to pass the bill again to convert it an act of the parliament after an assent by the President.
The proposed law provided for the insertion of a new section 52B in the PPC for defining an “enforced disappearance”. It stated: “The term enforced disappearance relates to illegal and without lawful authority arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by an agent of the State or by person or group of persons acting with the authorisation, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which places such a person outside the protection of the law.”

1,Israeli strike kills Al Jazeera journalist’s nephews,"Wael al-Dahdouh had lost his son, Hamza, just a day earlier; UN sounds alarm over ""high death toll"" of media workers in Gaza.","GAZA STRIP: Two relatives of the director of Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau were killed in an Israeli air strike on Monday, the health ministry in the territory and family members said.
Brothers Ahmed al-Dahdouh, 30, and Muhammad al-Dahdouh, 26, were travelling in a car when it was hit in the Gaza Strip’s southern city of Rafah, the ministry said, adding a third man accompanying them was also killed.
The bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdouh, confirmed to AFP that the two men were his nephews. His eldest son was killed in an airstrike just yesterday.
Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for the Gaza health ministry, accused Israel of  “targeting a civilian car”.
“I offer my condolences to Wael al-Dahdouh for the death of his relatives,” Qudra said in a statement. When contacted by AFP, the Israeli army said it was “checking” the claim.

Wael al-Dahdouh had lost his son, Hamza, just a day earlier; UN sounds alarm over ‘high death toll’ of media workers in Gaza

AFP footage showed the mangled remains of the car, with its roof ripped off by the strike.
Muhammad worked as an accountant at a school and Ahmed was an electronics engineer, a relative said.
Al Jazeera said on Sunday that a similar strike in Rafah killed two Palestinian journalists working for it, including Wael’s son Hamza.
 






Hamza was killed along with Mustafa Thuria, who also worked as a video stringer for AFP and other news organisations,  “while they were on their way to carry out their duty” for the Qatar-based network, it said.
AFP‘s global news director Phil Chetwynd said the agency was “shocked” by Mustafa’s death and its thoughts were with his family.
“We vigorously condemn all attacks against journalists doing their jobs and it is essential we have a clear explanation as to what happened,” Chetwynd added.
A third freelance journalist travelling with them, Hazem Rajab, was seriously wounded along with the driver.
The Israeli army, when asked about Sunday’s strike, told AFP that it had ‘struck a terrorist who operated an aircraft that posed a threat’ to troops.
The army said it was “aware of the reports that during the strike, two other suspects who were in the same vehicle as the terrorist were also hit”.
The Al Jazeera bureau chief was recently wounded himself in a strike, and had lost his wife and two other children in Israeli bombardment in the initial weeks of the war.
UN condemnation
The UN voiced alarm Monday at the many journalists killed in the war in Gaza, a day after two Al Jazeera reporters died in an Israeli strike on their car.
“Very concerned by high death toll of media workers in Gaza,” the UN rights office said on X, formerly Twitter.
 






“Killings of all journalists, including Hamza Wael Dahdouh and Mustafa Abu Thuria in reported IDF strike on car must be thoroughly, independently investigated to ensure strict compliance with international law, and violations prosecuted,” it said.
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 79 journalists and media professionals, the vast majority Palestinian, have been killed since the war began. However, according to major international media outlets, 109 journalists have been killed since October 7.
Israel has responded with relentless bombardment and a ground invasion that have killed at least 23,084 people, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry’s latest toll.

4,China claims head of foreign consulting firm spied for UK,"Beijing says Huang received ""training"" in Britain, passed on ""17 state secret"" to MI6.","BEIJING: China’s spy agency has said that the head of a foreign consultancy had been found to be spying for Britain’s MI6 intelligence service.
The Ministry of State Security said in a WeChat post on Monday that Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, also known as MI6, used a foreign national with the surname Huang to establish an “intelligence cooperation relationship”.
Huang, who headed a foreign consulting agency, “entered China several times under instructions to use their public profile as a cover to collect China-related intelligence for Britain… and seek other personnel whom MI6 could turn”, the ministry said. He allegedly passed 17 pieces of intelligence, including confidential state secrets, to MI6 before he was identified, it added.
According to the ministry, he had received “professional intelligence trai­ning” in Britain and had used “specialist spying equipment” to send communications.

Beijing says Huang received ‘training’ in Britain, passed on ‘17 state secrets’ to MI6

The ministry said an investigation had “prom­ptly discovered criminal evidence that Huang was engaged in espionage activities, and took criminal coercive measures in accordance with the law”.
The statement did not provide further details of Huang’s identity or employer, or describe their current condition or whereabouts.
China’s foreign ministry also declined to provide further comment when asked about the case at a regular press briefing. Britain’s embassy in Beijing directed an AFP request to comment to the Foreign Office in London.
Trading barbs
China and Britain have traded barbs in recent months over allegations of perceived espionage and its resulting impact on national security.
Britain’s government has warned that Chinese spies are increasingly targeting officials, allegations that Beijing has denied.
China, which has a broad definition of state secrets, has publicised several other alleged spying cases in recent months.
In May, authorities sentenced John Shing-wan Leung, 78, an American citizen, to life in prison for espionage.
However, later in October, the ministry published the story of another alleged spy, surnamed Hou, who was accused of sending several secret and classified documents to the US.

5,India’s Supreme Court cancels release of Gujarat rapists,"If the convicts can “circumvent the consequences of their conviction, peace and tranquillity in the society will be reduced to a chimaera,"" says court.","NEW DELHI: India’s Supreme Court on Monday cancelled the premature release of 11 convicted rapists of Bilkis Bano, saying the Gujarat government does not have the power to grant them liberty.
The court has asked the convicts to surrender back to prison within two weeks.
The Gujarat government under the same Bharatiya Janata Party that was in power during the riots had announced the decision to grant the 11 men premature release on August 15, Independence Day, in 2022.
The Supreme Court division bench of Justices B. V. Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said that the state of Gujarat “acted in complicity with the convicts” and noted that “it was this very apprehension which led this court to transfer the trial out of the state” to Maharashtra, according to LiveLaw, which live-tweeted the delivery of the order.
 
 

In a scathing judgment, the court also noted that if the convicts can “circumvent the consequences of their conviction, peace and tranquillity in the society will be reduced to a chimaera.”
Another key observation by the court was: “We hold that deprivation of liberty to the respondents (convicts) is justified. They have lost their right to liberty once they were convicted and imprisoned. Also, if they want to seek remission again, it is important that they have to be in jail.”
The apex court has now held that the judgment of May 13, 2022, by a bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Vikram Nath, which directed the Gujarat government to consider remission, “a nullity” as it was obtained by “playing fraud on the court” and by suppressing material facts.
“All proceedings taken in furtherance of the judgment are also vitiated and a nullity in law,” the court said.
The bench also said that the government of the state where the offender is sentenced is the appropriate government to grant remission, not the government of the state where the offence took place, LiveLaw tweeted.
 






Bilkis Bano is one of the several petitioners who challenged the Gujarat government’s remission of the convicts’ sentences. The court held that since Bano’s plea was held maintainable, there was no need to answer whether the other public interest litigations were maintainable too.
Justice Nagarathna said, on the ground that the Gujarat government lacked competence alone, the writ petitions were liable to be allowed and the “orders are liable to be declared as nullity.” But, she said, the matter does not end there as reliance was placed on an earlier judgment which directed the Gujarat government to consider the case.
The earlier judgement “is contrary to the Constitution Bench judgment in the Sriharan case,” the Supreme court said. According to LiveLaw, Justice Nagarathna said that the “power to grant remission is ultimately an exercise of discretion by the authority. The test is whether the authority was acting within the scope of powers and whether it was exercised in accordance with law. There is arbitrariness if there is non-consideration of relevant factors, non-application of mind, acting on dictation, or any usurpation of power.”
Usurpation of power arises when power vested in one authority is exercised by another, the judge said. “Applying the principle in this case, having regard to our answer of “appropriate power”, Gujarat government exercising the power was an instance of usurpation of power.”
 
 

The bench noted that the Gujarat government usurped the powers of the Maharashtra government, acting in furtherance of the judgment dated May 13, 2022. “It was the State of Maharashtra which was the appropriate government to consider the remission,” it said. The bench had concluded hearings in the case on October 12.
Granting remission, the Gujarat government had said that this decision had been arrived at by a panel it had set up, comprising officials and ‘social workers’ — all of whom were BJP members or were connected with it.
At that time, several of the accused had threatened witnesses while on temporary parole. One panel member, a BJP MLA, had said that the convicts deserved to be released because they were “Brahmins with good sanskaars, or values”.
