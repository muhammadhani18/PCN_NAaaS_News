Fermin Lopez opened the scoring for Barca in the 18th minute with a tap-in from a low cross from Raphinha, who then made it 2-0, collecting a fine long ball from young debutant Hector Fort in the 51st minute.
Despite Barcelona looking dominant, Adria de Mesa lifted the spirits of the home crowd when he capitalised on a loose ball in the box to pull one back for Barbastro in the 60th minute.
Barbastro went close to equalising, before substitute Robert Lewandowski made no mistake from the penalty spot to extend Barca’s lead with two minutes to go.
Barbastro’s Marc Prat made it 3-2 in stoppage time also with a penalty, but the hosts could not prevent Xavi Hernandez’s side sealing the win.
“It seemed like the match was over, (but) these games always get complicated,” Xavi told Movistar. “It’s a positive result, our play was positive in many moments, and we’re in the last 16.” 
Elsewhere, an own goal by Einar Galilea early in the second half was enough for Real Sociedad to claim a 1-0 away win over Malaga.
La Liga side Las Palmas were beaten 2-0 at second-tier Tenerife with first-half goals from Jose Maria Amo, who was later sent off for a second booking, and Luismi Cruz. The visitors were also reduced to 10 men after Julian Araujo was sent off in the 76th minute.
Sevilla beat Racing Ferrol 2-1 thanks to a goal from Brazilian defender Marcao, who dedicated his first-half effort to his father who passed away on Saturday, and another from Juanlu Sanchez, who scored late in the game.
Fran Manzara had equalised for Racing but received a second yellow card to be sent off in the 75th minute.
Villarreal’s clash against Unionistas Salamanca was suspended after power failures at the Reina Sofia stadium. Villarreal had taken the lead with a goal from Ilias Akhomach before Alfred Planas’s late penalty sent the game to extra time.
The Spanish FA later announced the match will resume late on Monday.
Last season’s Cup runners-up Osasuna struggled to overcome third-division Castellon, with the match going to extra time before Jose Arnaiz’s goal clinched a 1-0 victory.
Valencia also had to dig deep to earn a 2-1 win at 10-man Cartagena after extra time, with Sergi Canos and Jose Luis Gaya scoring to send the La Liga side into the next round despite the hosts having led most of the game.
Athletic Bilbao made light work of Eibar in a 3-0 win, with all three goals coming in the first half, as Asier Villalibre netted a brace and Iker Muniain also got on the scoreboard.

1,Liverpool strike late to knock Arsenal out of FA Cup,LONDON: An own goal by Jakub Kiwior and a thumping late strike by Luis Diaz sealed a 2-0 victory for Liverpool at...,"LONDON: An own goal by Jakub Kiwior and a thumping late strike by Luis Diaz sealed a 2-0 victory for Liverpool at Arsenal in the weekend’s headline FA Cup third round tie as the hosts’ dismal form extended into the New Year on Sunday.
Arsenal wasted a sackful of chances in the first half and were made to pay as Liverpool skipper Trent Alexander-Arnold’s free kick glanced off the head of Kiwior in the 80th minute.
Diaz then made sure of eight-time winners Liverpool’s place in the fourth round draw as he lashed home in stoppage time.
Premier League leaders Liverpool had been second-best in the opening period with Arsenal unable to make the most of a flurry of early chances — captain Martin Odegaard coming closest as he rattled the crossbar with a powerful drive.
Liverpool improved after the break though and their 7,000 army of travelling fans were rewarded with a two late goals.
Arsenal have now lost their last three games in all competitions.
“We changed things around at halftime internally, and we came out and played football and created chances,” Alexa­nder-Arnold said.
“There were times in the first half that we were a little bit naive ... We hit the woodwork a couple of times, so we’ve had our chances, and towards the end, we put them away.”
Meanwhile, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta admitted the Gunners need a psychological  “reset” after missing a host of chances.
“Probably it has (become a psychological issue). Especially after  today, more than it was against Fulham or West Ham United before that. That’s  why I think we need to reset,” he said.
Arsenal will have a chance to recharge during a 13-day break before their next match against Crystal Palace.
Arteta believes that time off could be valuable as Arsenal look to get back on track.
“This  break is good. It comes in a good time. When things are going well they  jump on the train. Now things are difficult, let’s see where they  stand,” he said.

Ahead of the Australian Open, the 61st-ranked Marozsan outlasted the 37-year-old Frenchman 6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-4).
The 24-year-old Hungarian, who produced a stunning win over world number two Carlos Alcaraz last year in Rome, said:  “I’m happy to beat Monfils, he’s a great player.
“He was a top-10 player in the last 15 years so he has great experience.”
Monfils, spurred on by the crowd chanting his name, looked exhausted in the closing stages of the two-hour, 35-minute marathon as he leaned on either his racket or a sideline chair between points.
Marozsan will face world number 15 Shelton in round two.
The American is coming off a first-round exit in Brisbane and will be keen to get game time under his belt before heading to the first Grand Slam of the year starting on Sunday.
In an upset, Botic van de Zandschulp from the Netherlands defeated fifth seed Chris Eubanks, who struggled with a back injury, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.

3,"‘Sleeping giant’ India awakening, says Stimac",NEW DELHI: Igor Stimac says Indian football is  “definitely out of its slumber” but the outspoken coach warned...,"NEW DELHI: Igor Stimac says Indian football is  “definitely out of its slumber” but the outspoken coach warned against big expectations at the Asian Cup starting on Friday in Qatar.
Football has struggled to find its feet in the cricket-obsessed nation of 1.4 billion people, with former FIFA president Sepp Blatter once calling India  “a sleeping giant” of the sport.
Former West Ham United and Derby defender Stimac was appointed coach in May 2019 and India briefly broke into the top 100 of FIFA’s world rankings for only the second time in nearly three decades.
They are now 102nd, a spot below Kosovo, whose population is less than two million.
“A giant is definitely out of its slumber now,” declared Stimac, before cautioning:  “But I reckon it will take us another four years to enter the top 10 in Asia.”
Under the former Croatia international, 
India qualified for the Asian Cup with three wins from three against Hong Kong, Afghanistan and Cambodia, scoring eight times and conceding once.
India’s campaign starts on Saturday against 25th-ranked Australia and they have a mountain to climb in Qatar to get out of a group also containing Uzbekistan and Syria.
“We are far from being happy with the draw but it is what it is,” the 56-year-old Stimac, part of the Croatia team that finished third at the 1998 World Cup, said in an email interview.
“With a very short time for preparation it’s difficult to expect great things, but my even greater concern are the injuries to some of our key players.
“Anyway, we are going to give our best and make it very difficult for our opponents.”
This will be India’s fifth Asian Cup. They were runners-up in 1964 in a tournament that had only four teams, but apart from that they have never got out of the group phase. They have never reached the World Cup.
Stimac’s side lost 3-0 at home to reigning Asian champions Qatar in World Cup qualifying in November, underlining the task facing them in the coming weeks.
They also suffered friendly defeats to Malaysia and Iraq, before beating Kuwait 1-0 away in World Cup qualifying.
Stimac blamed the Malaysia and Iraq losses on  “terrible refereeing”.

4,Mbappe and PSG revel in nine-goal rout,PARIS: Kylian Mbappe helped record 14-time champions Paris St-Ge­rmain avoid an embarr­assing slip-up with a 9-0...,"PARIS: Kylian Mbappe helped record 14-time champions Paris St-Ge­rmain avoid an embarr­assing slip-up with a 9-0 rout at sixth-tier amateurs Revel in the French Cup on Sunday.
Revel’s young supporters had implored Mbappe to make the trip to the game played at Castres — Revel’s humble stadium only has capacity for 2,000 fans in the Haute-Garonne south-western region — in a video posted on social media.
And they got their wish with the 25-year-old star included in manager Luis Enrique’s strong travelling party to the leaders of Regional 1, five rungs below the capital giants in the French league ladder.
Revel defender Maxence N’Gue­sson did get on the scoresheet but sadly for an own goal as the first half drew to a close.
PSG are hungry to add to their cup tally after missing out on the title in the past two seasons.
Olympique de Marseille also progressed from the round-of-64 with a narrow win at Thionville, the hosts four leagues below Pierre-Emerick Aubam­eyang’s 62nd minute shot making the difference.
Monaco also lived to fight another day but only after a 6-5 penalty shoot out win over Ligue 1 rivals RC Lens after the teams were locked at 2-2.
On Saturday, having travelled nearly 7,000km from the Caribbean island of Martinique, Golden Lion got a 12-0 mauling from Ligue 1 big guns Lille.

5,Vlahovic keeps Juve in touch with leaders Inter as Napoli’s nightmare continues,MILAN: Dusan Vlahovic made sure that Juventus stayed two points behind Serie A leaders Inter Milan with the decisive...,"MILAN: Dusan Vlahovic made sure that Juventus stayed two points behind Serie A leaders Inter Milan with the decisive late goal in Sunday’s 2-1 win at 10-man Salernitana, as troubled Napoli crashed to a 3-0 defeat at Torino.
Serbia striker Vlahovic thumped home a perfect header in the first minute of stoppage time to snatch the points for Juve, completing a fine comeback from a goal down at the Stadio Arechi.
“We gave everything tonight and we deserved to win. We never give up, we give everything right to the end,” said Vlahovic to DAZN.
“Our aim is to get back into the Champions League, after that we’ll take each game as it comes and see where we end up.”
The 23-year-old’s seventh goal of the season came at the end of a battle in soaking Salerno, where the hosts fought bravely even after losing goalscorer Giulio Maggiore to a second booking in the 53rd minute.
Maggiore had shot Salernitana ahead six minutes before the break but substitute Samuel Iling-Junior put the away side level with a powerful close-range finish in the 65th minute, setting up a blockbuster finale.
And Vlahovic made sure that Juve kept pace with Inter who were controversial winners over Verona on Saturday and have a much tougher run of fixtures over the next month.
Salernitana, who were hammered 6-1 by Juve in the Italian Cup midweek, stay bottom of the division after an unfortunate defeat, their fifth in seven matches.
Earlier, furious Napoli supporters launched flares onto the pitch at the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino during the latest embarrassing loss which left them languishing in ninth place and came via goals from Antonio Sanabria, Nikola Vlasic and Alessandro Buongiorno.
Last season’s historic Scudetto has now been forgotten as Napoli sink further into the abyss with each passing week, their third defeat in four matches in all competitions fully deserved after a shambolic display in Turin.
Without Nigeria striker Victor Osimhen, Walter Mazzarri’s side failed to score for the fourth straight match and are completely unrecognisable from the team which charged to title glory last term.
“We have to apologise to the fans for the performance... we’re trying to find ways to stimulate the team and get back to some sort of normality,” said Napoli’s sporting director Mauro Meluso.
Meluso spoke to DAZN after a series of post-match summits with Mazzarri and the team, and insisted that the coach — who was suspended for Sunday’s match — would not be sacked.
“I, the club and the team have total faith in the coach, so we’re not having thoughts in that direction,” he added.
Mazzarri was brought in to clean up the mess left by predecessor Rudi Garcia but Napoli are now a full 20 points behind league leaders Inter and closer to the relegation zone than the top of the table.
MILAN CRUISE
Meanwhile, a sumptuous early strike from Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Olivier Giroud’s 31st minute penalty set third-placed AC Milan on the way to a 3-0 win at Empoli which was sealed by Chaka Traore with two minutes remaining.
Missing a host of players to injury and the Africa Cup of Nations, Milan took advantage of their closest rivals for the top four dropping points.
Stefano Pioli’s team are six points ahead of fourth-placed Fiorentina who lost 1-0 at Sassuolo on Saturday, and a further point in front of Bologna in fifth following their draw at Genoa.
Milan have had a bumpy campaign riddled with injuries and questions over Pioli’s future but Sunday’s win was their fifth in six matches in all competitions.
“It’s in the difficult moments that you learn if people have given up on you, and that wasn’t the case here,” said Pioli.
“When things don’t go well we stay together and we give each other a hand.”
Elsewhere, Lazio warmed up for their midweek derby with AS Roma in the Italian Cup quarter-finals by winning 2-1 at Udinese.
Maurizio Sarri’s side are seventh, one point ahead of Roma who were held to a 1-1 home draw by sixth-placed Atalanta.

Kishmala, who won bronze at last year’s Asian Games, did just enough to qualify for the final before coming good with a score of 236.3 to finish second behind India’s Esha Singh (243.1). Another Indian Sngwan Rhythm clinched bronze with 214.5. 
The top two shooters in each category were to secure Paris quotas for their respective countries at the Championships, which are doubling up as Olympic qualifiers. 
The 21-year-old Kishmala, who also won silver at the 2019 South Asian Games, becomes the first female shooter from the country to qualify for the Paris Games and the third overall after Gulfam Joseph and G. M. Bashir.  
Having posted 575 in qualifying, Kishmala just managed to squeeze through to the final. 
Kishmala, though, started strong in the final, logging a 52.4 for her first five shots to take the lead. By the next five, however, Esha had taken over with 100.4 to Kishmala’s 100.1. 
Kishmala slipped to third after the 20th round, narrowly behind Rhythm, only to haul herself back into second place with her next two shots of 10.4 and 10.0 but Esha had gone too far ahead by then. 
The quota for Kismala also makes her eligible to compete in 25m sports pistol at the Olympics if she is selected by the national federation for both events at the quadrennial showpiece. 
Kishmala was among 12 athletes from the country who received the International Olympic Committee Scholarship in 2022, allowing them to prepare for the Paris Games. 
Pakistan’s javelin star Arshad Nadeem was the first from the country to book a spot in Paris after finishing with a silver medal at last year’s World Athletics Championships.

7,Rizwan appointed as Pakistan T20 vice-captain,Pakistan takes on New Zealand in the first T20I on January 12 in Auckland.,"LAHORE: After being stripped off his Test vice-captaincy following Pakistan’s dismal exit from the World Cup, wicket-keeper Moham­mad Rizwan was handed over the position for the Twenty20 International format on Monday.
Rizwan’s first assignment in the role will be of deputising newly-appoin­ted captain Shaheen Shah Afridi in Pakistan’s upco­ming five-match T20 series against New Zealand.
“It is an honour to be named as the vice-captain of Pakistan Men’s T20I side,” Rizwan was quoted as saying in a PCB press release on Monday. “I am thankful to the PCB for entrusting me with this responsibility. I am looking forward to working closely with the captain, coaching staff, and my team-mates to contribute to the team’s success.”
The 31-year-old has been out of the Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) good books since Zaka Ashraf took charge of the body as its interim management committee chairman in July last year.
Reportedly, the bone of contention between Rizwan and the board was his refusal to advertise surrogate betting companies — a stand he shared with former skipper Babar Azam, who stepped down from the post after the World Cup and was replaced by Shan Masood in Tests and by Shaheen in T20s.
It had also emerged that Rizwan and Babar were represented by a powerful sports agent, whose apparently significant control over the team has irked Zaka over the past few months.
Rizwan’s appointment as Pakistan’s T20 vice-captain may have been made due to the injury absence of Shadab Khan, who had held the position previously.
Pakistan take on New Zealand in the first T20I on Jan. 12 in Auckland. The series will run until Jan. 21.

8,Arthur and his hand-picked staff part ways with  PCB ‘amicably’,Arthur’s handpicked staff physiotherapist Cliff Deacon and strength and conditioning coach Drikus Saaimon retain their roles.,"LAHORE: Former Pakistan team director Mickey Arthur and his support staff have decided to part ways with the country’s cricket board nearly two months after they were unceremoniously removed from their respective posts following the national side’s dismal World Cup campaign.
Arthur, former head coach Grant Bradburn and ex batting coach Andrew Puttick were asked to report at the National Cricket Academy here in November following their removal after Pakistan failed to qualify for the World Cup semi-finals.
Morne Morkel, part of Arthur’s staff as the bowling coach, had resigned days after but the director himself, Bradburn and Puttick had not acted or spoken over the developments immediately and had flown out of Pakistan
On Monday, however, the trio reached an amicable solution with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after returning to address the situation, sources told Dawn. Under the deal, Arthur, Bradburn and Puttick will be paid salaries of three months in advance before letting go of their jobs.
Arthur’s handpicked staff included physiotherapist Cliff Deacon and strength and conditioning coach Drikus Saaimon, but both were retained in the roles following the former skipper Mohammad Hafeez’s appointment as the team director and a new coaching staff under him.
Arthur was appointed in the directorial role by former PCB interim management committee chairman Najam Sethi. He, however, was simultaneously working as the head coach of English county side Derbyshire and carried out his Pakistan duties remotely.
The South African joined the national side’s dressing room during the Asia Cup in September and was with the team throughout the tournament and the World Cup that followed.
Pakistan finished fourth in the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup, in which archrivals India subjected them to a 228-run drubbing. In the World Cup, they won only four of their nine matches and after the tournament, the side’s then skipper Babar Azam stepped down from the position.
Babar’s resignation was the earliest move in the revamp of the Pakistan team management before Hafeez was appointed as director, Wahab Riaz as chief selector, Shan Masood as Test captain and Shaheen Shah Afridi as the T20I skipper.
In Hafeez’s first assignment, Pakistan lost the recent three-match Test series against Australia 3-0.
In 2017, Arthur had led Pakistan to Champions Trophy triumph as the head coach before he was denied a contract extension by the PCB after the team’s failure to make the semi-finals of the 2019 World Cup.
When Sethi took charge in January last year, he reappointed Arthur owing to his healthy working relationship with the 55-year-old.
Sethi was vocal about his trust in Arthur’s abilities, especially due to his previous achievements with the Pakistan team and insisted him to work for the outfit again.
But that and Arthur’s bitter 2019 experience saw Sethi compromise on Arthur’s Derbyshire role and was acceptable of the coach managing two professional sides at the same time.

9,South African Klaasen quits Test cricket,"“We look forward to seeing him excel in the white-ball arena and continue to make valuable contributions to South African cricket,” says Cricket South Africa’s director of cricket Enoch Nkwe.","JOHANNESBURG: South African wicket-keeper/batter Heinrich Klaasen has retired from red-ball cricket despite the country’s Test coach Shukri Conrad suggesting he would form part of his plans in 2024.
Klaasen has become a mainstay of the South African white-ball side, with his record-breaking 174 against Australia in a ODI in September.
He played four Tests between 2019 and 2023, managing 108 runs at an average of 13.00, but was set to return to the team this year according to Conrad, with current wicket-keeper Kyle Verre­ynne failing to impress.
“After a few sleepless nights wondering if I am making the right decision, I have decided to retire from red-ball cricket. It’s a difficult decision that I have made because it is by far my favourite format of the game,” Klaasen said in a statement on Monday. “But for now a new challenge awaits and I am looking forward to it.”
The 32-year-old has not elaborated on what that challenge may be, but with confirmed stints coming up in the SA20, IPL, the Hun­dred and Major League Cricket in the US, it appears he will feature prominently in the global leagues in T20.
Cricket South Africa’s director of cricket Enoch Nkwe confirmed Klaasen was still part of their white ball plans.“We look forward to seeing him excel in the white-ball arena and continue to make valuable contributions to South African cricket”.

“It’s in 200 days and it starts now. That’s why we have a major national cause this year: sport,” Macron, posing next to a punchbag, with gloves on his shoulder and a bit of sweat on his forehead, said in a video posted on social media platform X, previously known as Twitter.
“Sport at school. As you know, we’ve made 30 minutes of sport compulsory for all elementary school pupils, we’ve added more sport in secondary school and I invite you all to do at least 30 minutes of sport every day, I hope more if you can.”
Macron also highlighted other goals France had set for the Games.
“France will be hosting the most carbon-free Olympic and Paralympic Games in history, green Games that comply with the Paris (climate) agreements,” he said.
“We’re going to host gender parity Games, with as many female athletes as male. We’ll have some exceptional delegations of Olympic and Paralympic athletes and, I hope, a lot of French medals.”
Officials  in Macron’s office said the government had already met the target it  set in 2017 to have three million more people exercising regularly, and  was now aiming for another three million by 2027.
The Olympics will be held from July 26-Aug 11 
with the Paralympics being staged from Aug 28-Sept 8.

11,German World Cup-winning captain and coach Beckenbauer dies at 78,"BERLIN: Franz Becken­bauer, one of Germ­any’s greatest football players, who captained the team to World Cup...","

FRANZ Beckenbauer.—AFP

 
BERLIN: Franz Becken­bauer, one of Germ­any’s greatest football players, who captained the team to World Cup victory in 1974 then won the tournament again as manager in 1990, has died at the age of 78, the German football federation told AFP’s sports subsidiary SID on Monday. 
Beckenbauer passed away on Sunday, the DFB said. He had in the last years been suffering from health problems. 
“It is with deep sadness that we announce that my husband and our father, Franz Beckenbauer, passed away peacefully in his sleep yesterday, Sunday, surrounded by his family,” the family said in a statement to German news agency DPA. “We ask that we be allowed grieve in peace and spared any questions.” 
The statement did not provide a cause of death. 
Beckenbauer was a classy, dominant presence on the pitch for West Germany and Bayern Munich in the 1960s and 70s, using the calmness on the ball and effortless distribution that marked his midfield performances to virtually invent the central defensive sweeper role where he found most success. 
He collected 103 caps for West Germany, winning the 1972 European championship and then the World Cup on home soil having lost in the final to England in 1966. 
His Bayern Munich team was the best club side in the world during the mid-1970s, winning three successive European Cups and three successive Bundesliga titles, and Beckenbauer himself was twice named European footballer of the year. 
As national team manager his West Germany team lost in the 1986 World Cup final to Argentina but triumphed four years later in Italy as a combined German team. 
Beckenbauer, nicknamed Der Kaiser (“The emperor”), was one of three men to have won the World Cup as player and coach and his death comes three days after the first to do it — Brazil’s Mario Zagallo. France’s Didier Deschamps is the other. 
After coaching, Becke­nbauer moved into football administration but in 2016 he was fined by FIFA’s ethics committee for failing to co-operate with an inquiry into corruption over the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

In the bikes, Kevin Benavides claimed victories as a host of his rivals were penalised for speeding and two-time winner Sam Sunderland was knocked out of the race by mechanical problem ended his interest in this year’s edition, organisers said.
Moraes, a Brazilian Toyota driver won the 438km third stage by just nine seconds from Swede Mattias Ekstrom in an Audi.
Saudi Arabian Al-Rajhi (Toyota) was third at 1 minute 9 seconds but even he got lost.
“Navigating was pretty hard today,” he said.  “We had to backtrack several times. But we made it here.”
Moraes thanked his co-driver Armand Monleon for guiding him through the dunes.
“I have to give it up to Armand because the navigation was very tricky and he was on point on everything,” said Moraes who had time to help Toyota team-mate Seth Quintero.
“We had a good pace and didn’t have any punctures. We even stopped to help Seth — we gave our spare wheel to him so he could finish as well. It was a perfect day.”
Quintero, 21, came in 17th on the day and the American now sits 11th in the provisional rankings 27min 18sec behind leader Al-Rajhi who is 29 seconds ahead of Carlos Sainz (Audi).
The Spaniard finished sixth on stage 3, 3min 29sec behind Moraes.
Frenchman Sebastien Loeb (Prodrive), who started the day in third, suffered three punctures on the rocky roads from Al Duwadimi to Al Samiya.
Loeb said he ran out of spare tyres as he lost almost 24 minutes and dropped to ninth.
“The third came with 100 kilometres to go,” he said. “After the third one we had to repair. We lost a lot of time repairing the tyre and inflating it again.
“Then we had to stop every 20 kilometres because it was losing air.
“Sometimes you have punctures driving slowly, sometimes you go fast and you have no punctures. It’s difficult to understand really.”
Argentine Benavides on a KTM was third across the finish line but was promoted to first after Chile’s Pablo Quintanilla (Honda) and second-placed Spaniard Joan Barreda (Honda) were among riders caught speeding.
Quintanilla was hit with a six-minute penalty Botswana’s Ross Branch (Hero), winner on Saturday, retained first place overall, ahead of Sunday’s winner Chilean Ignacio Cornejo (Honda).
Sunderland, who won the race in 2017 and 2022, saw his dreams of a third crown go up in smoke as a mechanical problem ended his race.
The 34-year-old Briton, who was riding for the Spanish team GasGas, came to a halt after just 11 kilometres.
Sixth overall after Sunday’s second stage, Sunderland gave up after waiting for more than three hours hoping a vehicle would bring him oil.
