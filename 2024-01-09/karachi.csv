He said this during a surprise visit to the Spencer Eye Hospital on Monday.
The mayor said that the monitoring committees comprising elected representatives would submit their reports and suggestions.
In the light of their reports, the process of providing medical facilities in the KMC-run hospitals would be improved and more facilities would be provided to the people, he said.
The mayor said that it was his priority to bring improvement in the KMC-run health facilities and he would take all necessary steps in this regard.
He said that the Spencer Eye Hospital was an asset of Karachi and the KMC would not let anyone to destroy it.
He said that the KMC would ensure presence of all doctors and paramedical staff in the hospital and no negligence would be tolerated.
During the visit, Barrister Wahab inspected various wards, operation theatres, refraction chambers and doctor’s rooms in the hospital and checked the attendance register of the staff.
He inquired about the medical procedures used in the hospital and directed the staff to adopt modern techniques for eye treatment in the hospital and update all the equipment and machinery to new requirements. The mayor said that in the past the Spencer Eye Hospital was famous all over the world for eye treatment and patients from far and wide used to come here for treatment. Cornea transplantation was done regularly here to restore eyesight to a large number of people, he said.
He said that this hospital was the only hospital in Karachi and Pakistan where the best and most experienced eye surgeons provided services and the most complex operations were successfully performed. 
If attention had been paid to it in the past, this hospital would have been providing the best eye treatment facilities even today, he added.
He also met the patients in the hospital and asked them about their problems.
He said that the Spencer Eye Hospital was established on an area of more than one acre and it was important to utilise available premises because a large number of people, who cannot afford the expensive treatment of eye diseases in private hospitals, came here and this facility was a ray of hope for them.
He said that the cleanliness and security arrangements in the hospital would also be improved and better facilities would be provided.
He directed the hospital administration that they should fulfil their duty and provide best possible facilities to the patients.

1,Setback for GDA as appeals by Mirzas of Badin dismissed,Tribunals maintain ROs orders of rejection of nomination papers of Sunni Tehreek chief Sarwat Qadri and Aurangzeb Farooqui,"• Tribunals maintain ROs orders of rejection of nomination papers of Sunni Tehreek chief Sarwat Qadri and Aurangzeb Farooqui
• One appeal against Shehbaz’s candidature thrown out
• MQM-P’s Arshad Vohra, MQM-London’s Nisar Panhwar allowed to contest polls                
KARACHI: The Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) on Monday suffered a major blow as an election tribunal dismissed appeals of its two key leaders, Dr Fehmida Mirza and her spouse Dr Zulfiqar Mirza, against rejection of nominations papers by the returning officers (ROs).
The returning officer of a National Assembly constituency in Badin (NA-223) had rejected the nomination papers filed by the former NA speaker Fehmida, while her husband’s nomination papers from three provincial assembly seat (PS-70, PS-71 & PS-72) were also rejected by the RO concerned.
The couple filed a total of five appeals against the decisions of the ROs and after hearing all sides, the tribunal headed by Justice Arshad Hussain Khan of Sindh High Court dismissed them.
The ROs had rejected the papers of Dr Fehmida and Zulfiqar Mirza after two banks and some other candidates filed objections against their candidatures, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in its report also said that their names fell in a list of defaulters received from the State Bank of Pakistan.
Also on Monday, the appeals filed by Sunni Tehreek chief Sarwat Ijaz Qadri (PS-108 South-III) and Aurangzeb Farooqui of the Pakistan Rah-i-Haq Party (PS-88 Malir-V) against rejection of their nomination papers were dismissed by the election tribunals.
Plea against Shehbaz’s candidature dismissed
Another election tribunal, headed by Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, dismissed an appeal challenging the candidature of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president Shehbaz Sharif from a Karachi NA constituency.
The RO had accepted the nomination papers of the former prime minister from NA-242(Keamari-I) after dismissing the objections filed by rival candidates.
On Monday, the tribunal rejected the appeal and observed that objections pertaining to concealing facts and filing false statement could be raised before the tribunal to be constituted after the general elections if Shehbaz Sharif won the election.
Appellant Masood Khan Mandokhail, a relative and covering candidate of the PPP’s Qadir Mandokhail, contended that younger Sharif was a defaulter of various dues as he failed to disclose travel expenses, money trails of foreign property and pending cases/inquiries.
His lawyer Akhlaq Mandokhail stated that the issue of iqama was still unresolved and he had not mentioned the details of a number of his immovable properties as well as all fact about his tax returns in the nomination papers.
Representing the former prime minister, Advocate Khalid Javed questioned the maintainability of the appeal and argued that nothing had been concealed by the candidate and powers of RO were summary in nature.
Assistant Attorney General G. M. Bhutto and ECP law officer Sarmad Sarwar supported the impugned order of the RO and opposed the appeal.
The tribunal in its order noted that the grounds agitated by the appellant required a thorough probe but it had limited jurisdiction.
Under Section 62 (9) of the Election Act, the tribunal said, the RO must not reject a nomination paper on the ground of “any defect which was not substantial and may allow such defect to be remedied forthwith and failure on the part of RO to allow rectifying and amending any infirmity within nomination form violated the law”.
Another identical appeal filed by a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) candidate from the same constituency against the younger Sharif is fixed for hearing on Tuesday (today).
MQM-P, MQM-L candidates’ appeals allowed
The three tribunals in Karachi also allowed appeals of dozens of candidates against rejection of their nomination papers by ROs.
The candidates included Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Arshad Vohra (NA-250), MQM-London’s Nasir Ahmed Panhwar and Aftab Ahmed Baqai from NA-231 and NA-248, respectively.
Justice Khadim Hussain Tunio and Justice Memon expressed resentment over several ROs for rejecting the nomination papers of candidates over minor errors.
They remarked that action should be taken against such ROs as per law and asked the law officer of the ECP whether such RO was not given any training.
The tribunals also observed that apparently, the several nomination papers were rejected on the basis of unnecessary reasons.

2,Two more air travellers test positive for Covid in Karachi,Lab results showing the variant to be available in a few days.,"KARACHI: Two more passengers tested positive for Covid on Monday at the Jinnah International Airport, raising the total number of travellers detected with the infection within five days to six.
Sources said two male passengers, aged 26 and 27 years, arrived from Abu Dhabi and Jeddah, respectively. One of them was a resident of Kech, Balochistan.
“Their Rapid Antigen Tests (for Covid) were positive,” a health department official said, adding that their samples for detailed analysis had been sent to a Dow University of Health Sciences’ laboratory.
“The lab results showing the Covid variant they suffer from will be available in a few days,” he added.
Both passengers left for their homes after being advised to self-quarantine as a precaution.
Earlier, four international travellers hailing from different areas of Sindh and Punjab tested positive for Covid at the airport. All were advised to self-quarantine at homes.
It might be recalled that screening at airports has resumed in the wake of an emerging threat of JN.1, a ‘highly contagious’ Covid variant.
Described as a sub-variant of the Omicron lineage, the new variant is stated to be more transmissible than other circulating variants, and the proportion of cases caused by this particular virus has been rising in several countries.

3,Three ‘contract killers’ among five held in Karachi over murder of JI worker,Wasim Siddiqui was gunned down by armed assailants near Jamaatul Mursaleen Masjid on Jan 2.,"KARACHI: Police on Monday claimed to have arrested five suspects allegedly involved in the last week’s killing of a Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) worker in Orangi Town.
Wasim Siddiqui was gunned down by armed assailants near Jamaatul Mursaleen Masjid on Jan 2.
 
 

A police spokesperson said that a team used technical and human intelligence and managed to arrest three “hired assassins” and two others who gave the contract (supari) of killing.
The police identified the hitmen as Zafar Muhammad, Sheikh Majid Ali and Ahed Rashid and two others as victim’s relatives Muhammad Waseem and Shahzeb.
They had given Rs300,000 to the hitmen for killing the JI worker over some personal enmity, the spokesperson said in a statement.
Suspect Zafar, who belonged to a banned outfit, was earlier arrested in a bomb blast case in Orangi Town on June 13, 2004 but later released from prison. He was also arrested by the Orangi Town police in 2019 over possession of an illicit weapon.
Police sources said that the murder of the JI worker was not motivated by any political or religious reasons.
They said that a sister of suspect Shahzeb was married to a brother of the deceased and a domestic dispute had led to the murder.

4,"Muttahida, PML-N close to consensus as seat adjustment deal ‘almost finalised’",NA-242 remains the bone of contention between two parties.,"KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Monday claimed to have ‘almost finalised’ their seat adjustment deal and said that a formal announcement would be made by their top leadership in a couple of days.
An MQM-P delegation, led by senior leader Aminul Haq, visited the city headquarters of the PML-N and held what they called the ‘seventh and final’ round of talks in less than two months to finalise their electoral strategy, mainly focusing Karachi.
Rana Mashhood, a senior PML-N leader who landed in Karachi on Sunday to lead talks with the MQM-P from his party’s side, sounded confident as he said that “despite a few issues on a few things” the two sides had come close to a consensual deal.
 
 

“We have agreed on almost every issue and things are moving in a positive way,” he said while talking to reporters after his meeting with the MQM-P delegation. “We have agreed to bring down the rule of corruption and incompetence of the last 15 years which had ruined Karachi and other parts of Sindh.”

NA-242 remains the bone of contention between two parties

He said the teams of PML-N and MQM-P had done their jobs and held seven sessions which had addressed all micro details of the alliance and now the top leaderships of the two parties would look into their proposals and announce the agreement.
Sharing similar thoughts, Mr Haq of the MQM-P said that the alliance of the two parties was more than seat adjustment and electoral alliance as his party had principally agreed to support the PML-N for the next federal government.
“And this alliance of the two parties and few others actually looks for wide range of targets. We believe that if we continue with the same spirit, this alliance would be forming government in Sindh as well,” he added.
The sources, however, said that the two parties had come closer to finalise the deal but NA-242 remained the bone of contention between both sides as PML-N insisted to field Shehbaz Sharif whereas MQM-P wanted its senior leader Mustafa Kamal to contest the polls from the same constituency.
“However, there are indications which suggest that the MQM-P may accept the PML-N’s demand and withdraw its candidate,” said a source privy to the details of the talks between the two sides.
“The MQM-P has already offered its support to the PML-N in three other NA constituencies of Karachi — two from Malir and one in Lyari. However, the party [MQM-P] has categorically conveyed that it would not show any compromise in NA-240 where the PML-N wants Owais Noorani of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Pakistan to contest,” the source said.
Similarly, he said, the MQM-P would also not withdraw from NA-243, where the PML-N wanted to field Akhtar Jadoon, a former Sindh minister and PPP leader, who recently joined Nawaz Sharif’s party.
“The MQM-P has already agreed over three Sindh Assembly seats from Karachi and it’s hoped that it would further show some flexibility over the same number of seats at the final announcement,” added the source.

5,Year’s first anti-polio drive launched across Sindh,Health dept says poliovirus found in two more environmental samples from Karachi.,"KARACHI:The Sindh government on Monday launched this year’s first polio immunisation drive targeting over 10 million children under the age of five across the province.
Reacting to the report declaring two more environmental samples found in Karachi positive for poliovirus, Sindh Health Minister Dr Saad Khalid Niaz called for a holistic plan at the federal level to tackle the disabling and life-threatening disease.
“Polio-positive reports coming from any place in the country are extremely unfortunate. I believe that we need to have a comprehensive and integrated strategy at the federal level given the fact that the virus being reported here is directly linked to the variant in Afghanistan,” the health minister said while speaking at the launch of an anti-polio drive organised at the Urban Health Centre in Landhi.
 
 

According to him, the province of Sindh had reported two cases of polio last year. The cases were detected in the Gujro Union Council of District East, Karachi.
He regretted that Pakistan was one of the last two remaining countries in the world that’s still reporting polio cases.
“With collective efforts, we can beat this disease. Hence, I appeal to parents and teachers to play their role and cooperate with the polio teams. People can call 1166 if their children are left out during the drive.”

Health dept says poliovirus found in two more environmental samples from Karachi

Sharing details about the current drive, Dr Niaz said the seven-day immunisation drive, part of the National Immunisation Days, was being carried out simultaneously in all the 30 districts.
“A total of 37,000 vaccination teams guarded by over 4,000 personnel of the law enforcement agencies are participating in the campaign,” he said. Sources said the areas with the positive environmental samples in Sindh included Machhar Colony, Liaquatabad, Orangi Nullah, Muhammad Khan Colony (Keamari), Haji Mureed Goth, Khamiso Goth, Gadap, Hyderabad, Latifabad and Sukkur.
“The isolated virus has been classified as YB3A cluster. Initially, it came from Afghanistan, but now it’s being circulating locally,” an official said, describing the situation as worrisome.
“While polio has been endemic in some tribal areas of Pakistan, the current situation is caused by the deteriorating law and order on the Pak-Afghan border. There’s continuous people’s movement from Afghanistan, lacking immunisation initiatives to different parts of Pakistan and causing a resurgence of polio here,” he explained.
Pakistan was almost polio-free prior to that situation, he added.
Meanwhile, Dr Khalid Shafi representing the Pakistan Paediatric Association expressed his satisfaction over government efforts against the disease, urging parents to protect their children against the crippling disease.
Last year, Pakistan reported six polio cases.

6,Baqar orders action against police officers over failure to curb kidnappings,KARACHI: Taking notice of activities of heavily armed gangs of dacoits and incidents of kidnapping in Sukkur and...,"KARACHI: Taking notice of activities of heavily armed gangs of dacoits and incidents of kidnapping in Sukkur and Larkana, caretaker Chief Minister retired Justice Maqbool Baqar directed the provincial police chief to take action against the officers concerned for failing to maintain security situation in the interior parts of the province.
Over 20 people, mainly truckers, have reportedly been kidnapped during the past fortnight as armed dacoits have unleased terror by kidnapping as many as nine drivers.
On Sunday, a gang of dacoits opened fired on trucks, wounding two drivers in Kashmore and taking away nine drivers and cleaners into the riverine area.

He asked the provincial police chief that people were being abducted in the province. “What are DIGs and SSPs concerned doing if people are being kidnapped in their areas,” he questioned.
Justice Maqbool Baqar told the IGP that kidnapping incidents in Sukkur and Larkana should be stopped at all costs. “Immediately recover the abductees and give a report,” he ordered the IGP.
He said that police should cooperate with the families of the abductees and stay in touch with them. “Before the general elections, I want the best peace and order in the entire province so that the elections can be held in a better way,” he added.
Shah Latif University VC sent on forced leave
Meanwhile, the chief minister ordered an inquiry against the Vice Chancellor of Shah Abdul Latif University Khairpur Dr Khalil.
In a statement, the chief minister said that there were some serious allegations against the vice chancellor.
A three-member committee, consisting of vice-chancellors of three universities of Sindh, has been formed for the inquiry.
The committee members are NED VC Sarosh Lodhi, Dow VC Dr Saeed Qureshi and Sindh Madressatul Islam University VC Mujeebuddin Sehrai.
The chief minister directed VC Dr Khalil to go on leave until the inquiry was completed.
Meanwhile, the caretaker provincial government has received payment of Rs1.5 billion profit from Thar Coal.
In a statement on Monday, Chief Minister retired Justice Maqbool Baqar said that the Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company had announced its annual profit of Rs3 billion and so far it had given Rs4.11 billion share of profit to the provincial government.

7,KBA boycotts court proceedings to get case  against two lawyers withdrawn,"FIR registered for assaulting, abusing traffic police officer","KARACHI: The Karachi Bar Association (KBA) boycotted legal proceedings on Monday in response to registration of a case against two lawyers at the City Courts police station for allegedly assaulting and abusing a traffic police officer.
Early in the morning, lawyers closed the gates of the City Courts and prevented litigators from entering the court complex. Consequently, prisoners from jails could not be transported to the courts for their hearings.
Following an intervention of the sessions judge (South), the lawyers eventually opened the gates for litigators. But due to the continuing boycott, hundreds of cases scheduled for hearing were deferred by the courts.
Meanwhile, a meeting was held to resolve the issue at the office of the sessions judge (South), attended by the sessions judges of East, West and Central as well as police officials, including Iqbal Dara (DIG Traffic), Ghulam Nabi Keerio (SP Traffic City), Tufail (DSP Legal), Amjad Shakir (SSP City District) and the newly-elected president of the KBA, Amir N

FIR registered for assaulting, abusing traffic police officer

In a press statement, the KBA said: “On some assurance and for the good gesture and in the interest of justice, the litigants have been allowed to enter the court premises.”
During the meeting, a committee led by KBA general secretary Ikhtiar Ali Channa, including association’s cabinet members and police officials was also formed. It is slated to convene for Jan 10 to address the matter further.
The earlier boycott of the legal proceedings by the lawyers was postponed until a further announcement.
Mr Warraich told Dawn that lawyers would boycott the legal proceedings, close the doors of the city courts and stage a protest on Tuesday at M.A. Jinnah Road if their demands, including the immediate withdrawal of the FIR, were not met.
The case was registered at the City Courts police station on the complaint of traffic police officer Yousuf Ali under sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (obstructing public servant), 506 (intimidation), 504 (insult with intent to provoke), 337-A (cause to hurt any person), and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code against advocate Malik Nasir, advocate Rehman and unknown persons.
Referring to the incident in the FIR that occurred on Dec 8, 2023, it was mentioned that Yousuf Ali was busy in a challan campaign at Teen Hatti Chowk. He stopped a 13-to-14-year-old boy riding a motorcycle. He was fined and sent home while the motorcycle was impounded.
However, Mr Warraich denied these accusations, stating that an underage boy was legally detained by the police, and when his uncle advocate Nasir went to the police station, the staff misbehaved with him. Then he approached the sessions court (East) to file an application under Section 22/A of the Code of Criminal Procedure to register his case.
According to the FIR, Yousuf Ali appeared before the sessions court (East) on Jan 5. After the proceedings, the complainant claimed that advocates, Nasir and Rehman, and some unknown persons assaulted, manhandled and abused him, and torn his uniform.

8,Probe ordered into allegation of fake encounter  on plea of wounded teenager’s family,KARACHI: Police authorities on Monday ordered an inquiry to ascertain veracity of the claims of the parents of a...,"KARACHI: Police authorities on Monday ordered an inquiry to ascertain veracity of the claims of the parents of a teenage student that their son was shot at and critically wounded in a fake encounter in the SITE-A area last week.
On Monday evening, a large number of relatives of the victim Abbas and area residents held a  protest outside the Karachi Press Club and warned that if  the policemen responsible for shooting were not arrested, they would head towards the Chief Minister House to lodge a protest.
While the police claimed that Abbas, 18, was wounded in retaliatory firing by the police after he opened fire on them when he was signalled to stop, his family members claimed that he tried to speed away because he thought the policemen in civvies to be robbers.
South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that he ordered an inquiry.
Nek Zada, father of Abbas, told the media that Abbas was shot in a fake encounter. He was admitted to Trauma Centre of the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi and had been paralysed after sustaining two bullet wounds on his backbone and shoulder, the father said.
He claimed that he possessed a video showing three policemen in civilian dress who wounded his son.
He said his son had no criminal record and urged the authorities for a transparent probe. 
Abbas’ brother told the media that the policemen were in civilian dress and his brother Abbas tried to run away after leaving the motorbike as he assumed them as ‘robbers.’
However, SITE-A SHO Khalid Rafiq said  two persons riding a motorbike were moving towards Malakand graveyard in Pathan Colony. The SHO claimed that two policemen in uniform indicated them to stop but their bike hit something and they fell from it. They attempted to flee by resorting to firing on the policemen and in retaliatory firing, both persons were arrested, including Abbas, in wounded condition.

9,Khurshid warns country will suffer if polls deferred,SUKKUR: Pakistan Peoples Party’s veteran leader Syed Khurshid Ahmed Shah has warned that if general elections are...,"SUKKUR: Pakistan Peoples Party’s veteran leader Syed Khurshid Ahmed Shah has warned that if general elections are not held on Feb 8, this will badly tarnish Pakistan’s image worldwide and the country will suffer a great deal as a consequence. 
Shah, a PPP nominee for NA-201, told media persons here on Monday that it was the first instance in the country’s chequered history that a resolution had been passed by Senate for the postponement of elections. It should not have happened and the resolution should not have been tabled in the first place as a large part of the parliament had opposed the move, he said.
He said the Senate alone could not be called ‘parliament’ — it is in fact a component of it — because “a parliament comes into existence with Senate, President and National Assembly”.
He insisted that elections were very important for the country, if the polls were not held according to schedule, the country would suffer a great deal.
About resignation of the secretary of Election Commission of Pakistan, Shah said that there might be a story behind his decision. “It is an old story. Anyone who resigns cites his or her health as reason. If something happens to me today, I too will, after coming under pressure, say that I am sick and cannot continue with the assigned job,” he said.
He said that PML-N did not appear to canvass for election. Perhaps, the party might be assured there would be no elections, so it had better sit tight or there might be some other problem behind their disinterest, he surmised.
Shah claimed that Central Punjab and Lahore belonged to Bhutto as PPP was founded in Lahore. PPP’s candle was first lit in Lahore and now “we’ll light it again and take back Lahore, especially Central Punjab, as people have become politically aware,” he said.
He said the passion with which PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and his team were working, PPP was poised to spring a big surprise in 2024 elections.
About Karachi, he said that his party would make Karachi into the best city of the world. Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan had lost its erstwhile position in the city as people had given them eight chances but they did nothing for the city and its people.
In recent past, Karachi was completely ruined when extortion was the order of the day, corpses in sacks were found in the streets daily and no day went by without incidents of terrorism and target killings, forcing industry and capital to shift to other cities and foreign countries, he said. 
He claimed that the metropolis was developing thanks to PPP’s efforts and whatever further improvement the city would see would be made by his party.

The university’s vice chancellor, Prof Dr Nusrat Shah, presented the coveted document to different batches of MBBS, BDS, D. Pharm and a galaxy of postgraduates in surgery, medicine and ophthalmology, gynaecology and obstetrics. 
She congratulated the degree recipients on their achie­ve­ment and urged them to work hard to earn their position 
and recognition in practical life, which they were entering now. This university was producing with unwavering dedication competent graduates who would shoulder health sector’s responsibilities in future, she said. 
She said that it was Z.A. Bhutto, who had 50 years from now established the Chandka Medical College in Larkana which had grown into a medical university and was now serving Upper Sindh, parts of Balochistan and Punjab. Despite financial constraints the university had cleared its huge loan and was still braving financial problems, she said.
“We have overcome academic challenges and effectively established linkages with national and international institutions of repute. Not only the university has published its first online research journal but also trained over 100 faculty members in different disciplines, she said. 
She said addressing the fresh graduates: “You are now part of healthcare system and hence should be prepared to face challenges. It is now your turn to pay back to your motherland,” she said. 
She stressed the need for working on prevention of diseases and added that 64 per cent of population was in the age bracket of 30 years. “Therefore, you can contribute hugely to the health sector,” she said, adding there was greater need today of evolving connectivity between health sector and industry. “Instead of running after jobs we should be producers of jobs,” she added.
Prof Tahmina Nagraj, VC of Begum Nusrat Bhutto University, Sukkur; and Prof Dr Ghulam Asghar Channa, former VC of SMBBMU, said 
in their speeches that the 
fresh graduates should dedicate their talent to serving the ailing community. 
They gave the credit to Z.A. Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto for the medical university and reminded the graduates that the heights which they had achieved and the many more which they would surely summit in future would not have been possible without selfless and unwavering support of their parents. 
“It is not merely a white coat (apron) but it is a symbol of a profound pledge of serving humanity with dedication and devotion. The medical sector is a dynamic field which grows rapidly. You must focus on widening your scope of services,” they said.
A total of 250 graduates of Chandka Medical College, Larkana; 65 of Ghulam Muhammad Mahar Medical College, Sukkur; 120 graduates of Bibi Aseefa Dental College, Larkana; 42 of Benazir College of Nursing and 23 of the Institute of Pharmacy, received degrees at the convocation,. 
Of them, 64 meritorious graduates were awarded gold medals. Women outshined men in the number of medal recipients. Two shields introduced in memory of renowned Prof of Medicines late Dr Wazeer Mohammad Shaikh and Prof Dr Balqees Mailk were awarded to postgraduates in the fields of medicine and gynaecology. 
Sindh governor was reportedly expected to preside over the convocation but he could not make it and in his absence the SMBBMU’s vice chancellor chaired the gathering.

11,Dr Sikandar Shoro rejoins PPP to get his lost PA seat,"His arch rival and party colleague, Malik Asad Sikandar, gets ticket for NA constituency","HYDERABAD: A disgruntled Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader from Jamshoro district, Dr Sikandar Shoro, has returned to the party fold 
and managed to get its ticket for the PS-78 (Jamshoro-II) seat that had become bone of contention between him and Malik Asad Sikandar in the July 2018 general elections. 
The PPP leadership had previously given its ticket for this seat (formerly PS-82) to Malik Asad Sikandar. The seat has now been renumbered as PS-78 (Jamshoro-II) under recent delimitations. It is Kotri city’s Sindh Assembly constituency from where Dr Sikandar Shoro and his family’s members had been contesting for decades. But Malik had won PPP ticket for the seat even though he had fallen out of the party’s favour before the 2018 polls due to his differences with party leadership and Bahria Town. 
Dr Shoro, however, remained adamant and decided to contest the seat as an independent candidate, amidst a heated political environment, and joined hands with Sindh Untied Party’s Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah for his seat and against PPP’s National Assembly candidate from Jamshoro, Sikandar Rahupoto, a close friend of former Sindh CM Syed Murad Ali Shah.  
Malik Asad had taken on Dr Sikandar Shoro in his speeches ahead of the July 2018 polls.

But Dr Shoro made his presence felt regardless of Malik’s clout. Malik had also obtained PPP ticket for his friend, Giyan Chand Esrani, for Thana Bula Khan, another provincial constituency of Jamshoro and home to Malik Asad Sikandar.  
Dr Shoro had ran an effective election campaign in 2018 but lost by a margin of around 3,000 votes. He had attributed his defeat to highhandedness resorted to by supporters of Malik Asad. 
Over the last couple of years, the PPP leadership engaged Dr Shoro and he finally agreed to rejoin the party he had led as its deputy general secretary for Sindh as well.  
The PPP leadership has now given him the ticket for the very contest that had compelled him to bid farewell to the party he and his family had been associated with for a long time.  
Dr Shoro had challenged his defeat in an election tribunal but lost. 
Malik Asad has been given Jamshoro’s only NA seat that was won by former CM’s friend, Sikandar Rahupoto. Reports from Kotri indicate that Malik wanted this seat again in addition to the Thana Bula Khan seat for his son, Malik Sikandar Khan (who is named after Asad’s father). However, his request did not get party leadership’s nod. The PPP leadership has adjusted Malik’s friend Gian Chand Essrani on a reserved seat on preferential numbers.

12,AT holds 10km  foot march in Thatta against corporate farming,THATTA: Awami Tehreek held a 10-kilometre ‘foot march’ between Baghan and Gardho towns of Thatta district ...,"THATTA: Awami Tehreek held a 10-kilometre ‘foot march’ between Baghan and Gardho towns of Thatta district against “auction of 1.3 million acres of Sindh’s land in the name of ‘corporate farming leading to agricultural revolution’ and termed the initiative “landgrabbing”. 
A large number of AT activists took part in the protest march. They were carrying placards and banners inscribed with slogans against the plan. 
The march, which was led by AT president Lal Jarwar, general secretary Noor Ahmed Katiyar, vice president Hoorun Nisa Palejo and other leaders, was joined by people from different walks of life.  
Speaking to the participants, Lal Jarwar said people of Sindh strongly opposed the “landgrabbing and encroachment of Thatta’s Keenjhar and Haleji lakes as well as Kohistan, Bhanbhor and other coastal areas by the corporate sector. 
He demanded shelving of all such projects in the name of corporate farming and agricultural revolution, and warned the authorities concerned against forcing out locals from their lands. 
He said rulers of the country had already distorted the secular and democratic Pakistan of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah … they did not learn any lesson from the 1971 debacle ..., adding that “the country is being pushed back to the 1971 conditions”.  
He accused the outgoing government of Pakistan Peoples Party of having sold away thousands of acres in Thatta district alone to foreign firms through auctions for which fake documents were prepared. 
Millions of acres had been illegally acquired for various residential schemes like Bahria Town, Zulfikarabad and DHA City, he alleged, and also described the K-IV [water supply to Karachi] project as “death warrant of Keenjhar Lake”. The project would divert the entire Keenjhar water to the illegal housing schemes, he claimed.  
“Rulers of Sindh have no constitutional authority to auction the lands and resources of Sindh,” he maintained.  
Other AT leaders including Hoorun Nisa Palejo and Mitha Khan Lashari also spoke.—Press release.

At the head of the ‘joint action committee’, Rashidi demands that the VC should voluntarily quit until getting himself cleared through a fair investigation into his “indecent” video that had gone viral on the social media some 10 days back. 
The VC had reportedly approached the FIA and on his request, the agency picked up Rashidi after intercepting his car moving on Khaki Shah flyover, falling within the jurisdiction of the A-Section police station of Khairpur.
