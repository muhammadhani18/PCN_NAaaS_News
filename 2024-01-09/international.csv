0,Lander problem threatens US moon mission,"“We have prioritised maximizing the science and data we can capture,” says Astrobotic.","WASHINGTON: A robotic lander built by a private company suffered a propulsion system issue on its way to the moon on Monday, upending the first US soft lunar landing attempt in over 50 years as mission managers scrambled to fix its position in space.
Space robotics firm Astrobotic Technology’s Peregrine lunar lander had launched successfully to space at 0718 GMT from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard the first flight of Vulcan, a rocket that had been under development for a decade by the Boeing and Lockheed Martin joint venture,  United Launch Alliance (ULA).
But hours after separating from Vulcan, Astrobotic said, issues with Peregrine’s propulsion system briefly prevented the spacecraft from angling itself toward the sun for power.
While mission engineers regained control, the faulty propulsion system is losing valuable propellant, forcing Astrobotic to consider “alternative mission profiles”, suggesting a moon landing is no longer achievable.
The launch of Vulcan, a 200-foot-tall rocket with engines made by Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, was a crucial first for ULA, which developed Vulcan to replace its workhorse Atlas V rocket and rival the reusable Falcon 9 from Elon Musk’s SpaceX in the satellite launch market.
The stakes of the mission were high for Vulcan. Boeing and Lockheed, which own ULA in a 50-50 split, have been seeking a sale of the business for roughly a year. The launch was the first of two certification flights required by the US Space Force before Vulcan can fly lucrative missions for the Pentagon, a key customer.
A successful launch of the moon lander, which ULA agreed to fly at a roughly 50 per cent discount given the risks of flying on a new rocket, allows the company to start fulfilling a multibillion-dollar backlog of some 70 missions booked already. Vulcan sells for at least $110 million per launch.
Vulcan’s placement of the Peregrine lander into orbit was  “dead on bullseye”, ULA chief CEO Tory Bruno said.  “This has been years of hard work,” he added from the company’s launch control room after launch.
But the lander itself failed to enter its correct sun-facing orientation in space and saw its battery levels plummet, hours after it made successful contact with ground teams and activated its propulsion system.
It said in a later update that engineers had regained control of the spacecraft to allow it to charge its batteries. While Peregrine remains in Earth’s orbit, “we have prioritised maximizing the science and data we can capture,” Astrobotic said.
Elusive feat
Setting off for a 46-day trek on Monday, Peregrine was poised to mark the first US soft landing on the moon since the final Apollo mission in 1972, and the first-ever lunar landing by a private company _ a feat that has proved elusive in recent years.
“This is the moment we’ve been waiting for 16 years,” Astrobotic CEO John Thornton said after the Lander’s launch.
The mission is the latest in recent years among countries and private companies sprinting to the moon, a renewed stage of international competition in which scientists hope the moon’s water-bearing minerals can be exploited to sustain long-term astronaut missions.

1,Biden rejects calls for defence chief’s sacking,ABOARD ONE: The White House on Monday rejected Republican calls for US President Joe Biden to sack Defence Secretary...,"ABOARD ONE: The White House on Monday rejected Republican calls for US President Joe Biden to sack Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin after he took several days to disclose a hospitalisation.
“The president has complete confidence, continues to have confidence in Secretary Austin,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters travelling with Biden aboard Air Force One.
“The number one thing is we want to see him get well and back at the Pentagon.” Republicans have called for Austin to resign or be sacked after it emerged that Biden and the White House were unaware for several days that he had been hospitalised for an unspecified medical condition last week.
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Biden believed Austin had done an  “amazing job” and respected Austin for  “taking ownership” of the row.
“There is no plans or anything other than for Secretary Austin to stay in the job and continuing the leadership that has been exhibited,” Kirby told the same briefing.
“We’ll do what’s akin to a hot wash and try to see if processes and procedures need to be changed at all or modified, so that we can learn from this.” Austin had resumed his duties and was working from the Walter Reed military hospital in the Washington suburbs, added Kirby.
The spokesman would not comment on what Biden now knew about Austin’s medical condition. The Pentagon waited until Friday evening to announce that Austin, 70, had been hospitalised four days prior  “for complications following a recent elective medical procedure” — a breach of standard protocol at a time when the United States is embroiled in the Middle East crisis.
“I recognise I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed. I commit to doing better,” Austin said in a statement on Saturday.

2,Apple begins payout over slowing down iPhones,APPLE has initiated the disbursement of funds in a long-running class action lawsuit centred on allegations of...,"APPLE has initiated the disbursement of funds in a long-running class action lawsuit centred on allegations of intentionally slowing down specific iPhones in the US. 
Those who filed complaints will be entitled to a portion of the $550 million settlement, amounting to approximately $92 per claim, BBCNews reported. 
In 2020, Apple reached an agreement to settle the lawsuit, asserting its denial of any wrongdoing but expressing concerns about the escalating costs of prolonged legal proceedings. A parallel case in the United Kingdom (UK) is currently pursuing £1.6 billion in compensation.
The origins of the US lawsuit trace back to December 2017, when Apple acknowledged a longstanding suspicion held by phone owners. The company admitted to intentionally slowing down certain iPhones as they aged, citing the diminishing performance of aging batteries. According to Apple, this deliberate ‘slowdown’ was implemented to extend the overall lifespan of the phones.
However, it was still accused of regulating the performance of certain iPhones without informing customers on prior basis, and the backlash resulted in Apple offering a ‘cut-price battery replacement’ to fix the problem. 
The situation resulted in legal proceedings in the US. Initially, during the settlement phase, there were estimates suggesting that each complainant might receive as little as $25. However, the final pay-out exceeded those projections, amounting to nearly four times that sum for each person.
Apple previously called the lawsuit ‘baseless’ and said “we have never - and would never - do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades”.In contrast to the US settlement, which specifically covered devices within the iPhone6 and 7 series, the legal action in the UK also aims to secure compensation for customers owning iPhone8, 8 Plus, and X devices.

3,Iran seeks quick resolution of Umrah issue,DUBAI: Iran hopes technical problems preventing Iranian Muslims from making the Umrah pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia ...,"DUBAI: Iran hopes technical problems preventing Iranian Muslims from making the Umrah pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia will soon be resolved, foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said on Monday.
Iran initially announced in December that the first Umrah pilgrims would travel on Dec 19 following an agreement between Tehran and Riyadh to allow the pilgrimage to take place after a pause of eight years.
However, this flight and subsequent ones were cancelled due to Riyadh failing to provide  “necessary final permits” for the entry of Iranian planes into Saudi airports, the spokesman of Iran Air Hessam Qorbanali had told state TV.
“The relevant authorities have informed that it is just a technical issue and that there is no political dispute as the bilateral agreement regarding Umrah pilgrimage is well-established and Saudi Arabia is committed to it,” Kanaani said during a televised press conference on Monday. Saudi Arabia did not comment on the matter.
Kanaani added that Iran’s head of Haj and Pilgrimage was in Saudi Arabia with a team of experts to resolve the problems. According to semi-official Tasnim news agency, representatives of Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation are also in Saudi Arabia working on the issues.

4,"French PM Borne resigns, Macron to name new govt","PARIS: French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne resigned on Monday, as President Emmanuel Macron seeks to give a new...","PARIS: French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne resigned on Monday, as President Emmanuel Macron seeks to give a new impetus to his second mandate ahead of European parliament elections and the Paris Olympics this summer. Macron did not immediately name her successor.
The change in prime minister comes after a year marred by political crises triggered by contested reforms of the pension system and immigration laws. It also comes just five months before European Parliament elections, with eurosceptics expected to make record gains at a time of widespread public discontent over surging living costs and the failure of European governments to curb migration flows.
In France, opinion polls show Macron’s party trailing that of far-right leader Marine Le Pen by some eight to ten points ahead of the June vote. Speculation of a government reshuffle had been rife in the weeks since the narrow adoption in parliament of toughened immigration rules exposed deep cracks in Macron’s centrist majority. Macron himself promised a new political initiative.
Among those cited as potential candidates to replace Borne are 34-year-old Education Minister Gabriel Attal and 37-year-old Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu, either of whom would be France’s youngest ever prime minister. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and former agriculture minister Julien Denormandie have also been mentioned by pundits as possible options.
The change in prime minister will not necessarily lead to a shift in political tack, but rather signal a desire to move beyond the pension and immigration reforms and focus on new priorities, including hitting full employment.
A soft-spoken career bureaucrat who served numerous Socialist Party ministers before joining Macron’s governments, Borne had been prime minister since May 2022.

5,Britain reels from its ‘biggest miscarriage of justice’,LONDON: Public anger is mounting over what has been described as Britain’s biggest-ever miscarriage of justice ...,"LONDON: Public anger is mounting over what has been described as Britain’s biggest-ever miscarriage of justice that saw hundreds of sub-postmasters wrongly convicted of theft because of a computer software glitch.
Lives were ruined by the false accusations that led to some Post Office branch managers being jailed, going bankrupt, losing their homes and their health. Four people took their own lives and dozens of those since exonerated died without seeing their names cleared.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak described the scandal as an “appalling miscarriage of justice” that should “never have happened”.
Wave of sympathy
Now, a TV drama telling the story of the sub-postmasters’ ordeal at the hands of their own employer has generated a wave of sympathy for the victims. Critics hailed the four-part “Mr Bates vs The Post Office”, broadcast last week, for humanising the ordeal of hundreds of people prosecuted for false accounting and theft between 1999 and 2015.
However, the sub-postmasters — pillars of their local communities — had not stolen a penny. In fact, they were the victims of flawed accounting software and the state-owned Post Office’s determination to defend it.
Following the broadcast, a petition calling for former PO boss Paula Vennells to be stripped of an honour she received from Queen Elizabeth II has garnered more than a million signatures.
‘Lies and deceit’ 
The drama stars award-winning actor Toby Jones as Alan Bates, who leads a long David and Goliath battle to prove the postmasters’ innocence. It documents the fear and desperation of the branch managers as they struggled with the new “Horizon” software supplied by Japanese tech giant Fujitsu.
In one scene, sub-postmaster Jo Hamilton is depicted calling a helpline only to see the supposed shortfall in her accounts double on the screen as she speaks.
Hamilton was accused of stealing 36,000 ($45,000) but pleaded guilty to false accounting for fear of being sent to jail.
More than 700 sub-postmasters ended up with criminal convictions as a result of the scandal, with 236 serving jail time.
Jess Kaur, whose story was featured in the TV programme, broke down as she recounted the shame of being dragged before a judge for a crime she had not committed. “It drove me so mad that I tried to commit suicide,” she told Good Morning Britain, adding that after she was accused customers would spit on the floor of her shop in disgust.
Kevan Jones, an MP who sits on a board set up to award compensation to victims, said the programme had successfully communicated the depths of the sub-postmasters’ suffering. “The drama was very good not only at exposing the lies and deceit that took place, it showed the complete heartache and broken lives,” he said.
He warned, however, that it would be difficult to get more convictions overturned because “most of these people will not come forward... They will not go anywhere near a court of law because of the trauma”.

SYDNEY: A box of reptiles confiscated by the Australian police.—AFP

 
SYDNEY: An Austra­lian-based criminal syndicate plotted to smuggle hundreds of native reptiles into Hong Kong as part of a murky trade in live animals, police alleged on Monday.
Detectives began investigating the network in September last year, after intercepting nine packages bound for Hong Kong with 59 live lizards stashed inside. They allegedly discovered more than 250 lizards after searching a number of properties scattered across Sydney, as well as a small number of snakes and unhatched eggs.
Police said the captured reptiles were  “kept in poor conditions” before they were  “bound in small containers” to be sold in Hong Kong. Photos taken by police showed writhing lizards piled on top of each other in small plastic bins filled with soiled pellets.
Another photo showed a snake curling around a clutch of eggs in a clear plastic tub packed with wood chips. Each lizard could fetch as much as Aus$5,000 (US$3,360) on the black market, police said, giving the total seized haul a street value of as much as Aus$1.2 million.
Police have charged three men allegedly involved in the  “criminal syndicate” — aged 59, 54, and 31 — as well as a 41-year-old woman. Hong Kong is a major global transit point for the illegal trade in live animals, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock was in Israel on Monday and the European Union’s top diplomat Josep Borrell was in Lebanon in a sign of international concern.
“G7 countries are working with the Israeli government to find a rapid way out of the military phase,” the Italian Foreign Ministry quoted minister Antonio Tajani as saying as Italy began its one-year presidency of the Group of Seven.
Baerbock told Israel it had a duty to protect Palestinians in the West Bank after Blinken sounded the wider alarm in Doha on Sunday.

“I’ve been quietly working with the Israeli government to get them to reduce and significantly get out of Gaza,” Biden said at a church in Charleston, South Carolina where a white supremacist shot dead nine Black parishioners in 2015.
As the protesters chanted  “ceasefire now,” Biden said:  “I understand their passion.” The congregation at the Mother Emanuel African Methodist Church then drowned out the noise of the demonstration by chanting  “four more years” to back Biden’s campaign for a second term in office.

9,Several arrested in US as demos mount pressure  for ceasefire,WASHINGTON: New York City police arrested dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters on Monday for blocking traffic at the...,"WASHINGTON: New York City police arrested dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters on Monday for blocking traffic at the entrances to the Holland Tunnel and three East River bridges during the Monday morning commute.
Approximately 120 protesters were arrested while blocking entrances to the Holland Tunnel, which links downtown Manhattan with New Jersey. Protests also erupted at the Brooklyn Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, and Manhattan Bridge, connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn. 
The Holland Tunnel and the three bridges have since reopened. Highways were also blocked in Los Angeles, Seattle, and Chicago. Pressure is intensifying within the United States to demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, where an unprecedented Israeli military offensive has already claimed more than 23,000 Palestinian lives.
Reports from across the United States illustrate how various political, social, and human rights groups, along with student bodies, are collaborating to bolster the growing momentum for a ceasefire.
Mass protests
The “March on Washington for Gaza,” scheduled for Jan 13, organised by the American Muslim Task Force for Palestine, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), and others, is expected to draw a large crowd.
Similar rallies and protests in Atlanta, Georgia, Los Angeles, California, Minnesota, and Seattle, Washington, signal a groundswell of pro-Palestinian sentiment demanding an end to hostilities.
Congressional involvement
Noteworthy is the increasing number of Congress members (currently 63) calling for a ceasefire, with Representative Cori Bush introducing a resolution (H.Res. 786) for an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian aid to Gaza.
The call to “Stop Arming Israel” is gaining traction among activists, urging citizens to engage with their representatives. Thousands are writing to their senators to support the move for a ceasefire.
Minneapolis resolution
A significant development is the introduction of a resolution in the Minneapolis City Council, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and urging the federal government to withdraw support for Israeli military operations.
A solid majority of the Minneapolis City Council supports this initiative, underscoring a desire for action at various levels of government. Also this weekend, protests disrupted the first day of California’s legislative session, showcasing the depth of public sentiment, compelling political leaders to address the issue promptly.
Interfaith support
Speakers from diverse backgrounds, including Rabbi Jessica Rosenberg and leaders from Islamic, Jewish, and other groups, express solidarity in their call for a ceasefire. This coalition emphasises the humanitarian nature of the issue, transcending religious and cultural boundaries.
Cornel West, an American philosopher, and political activist joined the call for the January 13 protests in Washington DC, advocating for a permanent ceasefire. West highlighted the atrocities Gazans were enduring, saying, “We’re marching for our Palestinian brothers and sisters, and siblings in Gaza, undergoing a vicious genocidal assault, ugly ethnic cleansing, and living under apartheid-like conditions.”

10,Hezbollah leader killed in Israeli strike on south Lebanon,A US Defence Department official has told AFP that Israel carried out the Beirut strike.,"• 249 deaths in last 24 hours, death toll nears 23,000
• WHO axes medical aid delivery to Gaza in absence of security guarantees
• Pope says civilians killed in war aren’t ‘collateral damage’            
GAZA STRIP: Israel killed a top commander of Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement, a security source said on Monday, as Washington’s top diplomat visited the Middle East seeking to avert a widening of the Gaza conflict.  
On Monday, the Lebanese group announced the killing of its “commander” for the first time, naming him as Wissam Hassan Tawil.
A security official in Lebanon, requesting anonymity for security reasons, said Tawil “had a leading role in managing Hezbollah’s operations in the south”, and was killed there by an Israeli strike targeting his car.
The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah “military sites” in Lebanon on Monday, but did not immediately comment on Tawil’s death.
His is the second high-profile killing in Lebanon this month, following a strike in a Beirut stronghold of Hezbollah last week which killed Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Aruri.
A US Defence Department official has told AFP that Israel carried out the Beirut strike, which has heightened fears of the conflict in Gaza spreading.
Toll nears 23,000
The health ministry in Gaza said it had recorded 249 deaths in the previous 24 hours, dozens of whom arrived along with 99 wounded at Al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah city. Israel’s relentless bombardment and ground invasion have so far killed at least 22,835 people, most of them women and children, according to the ministry. 
The Al-Quds Brigades  reported “fierce clashes” on Monday, involving machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, with Israeli troops in the southern city of Khan Yunis.
Live AFPTV images showed black smoke over central and southern areas, and the sound of explosions.
Israel’s military reported its forces have “been working in recent days to expand” operations around Khan Yunis and said troops and warplanes struck 30 “significant” targets in the major city overnight Sunday-Monday.
These included underground targets and weapons facilities, it said, adding that a drone also killed 10 in Khan Yunis who were allegedly “preparing to launch rockets toward Israeli territory”.
Islamic Jihad later released a video it claimed showed an Israeli prisoner alive in its custody.
WHO axes aid deliveries
Separately, the World Health Organisation  (WHO) said it had been compelled to cancel a mission to bring medical supplies to northern Gaza on Sunday after failing to receive security guarantees. It was the fourth time WHO had had to call off a planned mission to bring urgently needed medical supplies to Al-Awda Hospital and the central drug store in northern Gaza since Dec 26, it said.  
The WHO has warned of the risk of famine and disease, with only minimal aid entering as people struggle to find water and other necessities.  
Pope condemns ‘war crimes’ 
Pope Francis on Monday condemned “war crimes” perpetrated against civilians in conflicts such as in Gaza and Ukraine, and said those killed should not be considered “collateral damage”.  
“The distinction between military and civil objectives is no longer respected,” the 87-year-old pontiff said in his New Year’s address to diplomats at the Vatican. 
“We must not forget that grave violations of international humanitarian law are war crimes,” he continued, in a speech dominated by calls for an end to conflicts around the world.  
Francis said people “need to realise more clearly that civilian victims are not ‘collateral damage’ but men and woman, with names and surnames, who lose their lives”. The pontiff said Israel’s “strong” military response “has caused an exceptionally grave humanitarian crisis and inconceivable suffering”. “To all the parties involved, I renew my appeal for a ceasefire on every front... and the immediate liberation of all the hostages held in Gaza,” Francis said.  
“I ask that the Palestinian people receive humanitarian aid, and that hospitals, schools and places of worship receive all necessary protection,” he added.

11,Blinken’s ‘tent meeting’ with Saudi crown prince,"The talks were set for potential normalisation of ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia after initial discussions were put on hold by the crisis, says a senior official.","AL ULA: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met on Monday with Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler before heading to Israel as part of efforts to stop the Gaza crisis spiralling into a regional conflict.
Blinken was expected to discuss Red Sea attacks by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, Saudi Arabia’s southern neighbour, during his talks with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.
Their private ‘tent meeting’ in Al Ula, a historic oasis in western Saudi Arabia, is the latest leg of a rapid tour of the region as concerns over the Gaza crisis continue to mount.
The talks were also set to touch on a potential normalisation of ties with Israel after initial discussions were put on hold by the crisis, a senior official said.
Blinken  “emphasised the importance of preventing further spread of the conflict”, during talks in Abu Dhabi earlier with United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a US summary of the meeting said.
“This is a conflict that could easily metastasise, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering,” Blinken said on Sunday in Qatar, the previous leg of his whistlestop tour.Vowing solidarity with the Palestinians, Yemen’s Houthis have launched more than 100 drone and missile attacks on targets in Israel and the Red Sea, disrupting traffic in the key shipping route.
The United States and 11 allies last week warned of unspecified consequences if the attacks continue. But the situation is tense for Riyadh as it coincides with attempts to settle a long-running war between the Houthis and a Saudi-led international coalition.
Blinken’s meeting with Prince Mohammed is also a chance to sound out the Saudis on the prospect of an eventual normalisation with Israel, a senior US official said — even if progress appears unlikely while the three-month aggression continues.
Saudi Arabia did not join the handful of Arab countries — including its neighbour the United Arab Emirates — in signing the US-brokered Abraham Accords recognising Israel in 2020.
