0,SC to resume Bhutto reference after polls,CJP Isa stresses need to 'rectify history'; promises top court will set a better example,"The Supreme Court has decided to defer the further hearing on the presidential reference regarding the death sentence of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto until after the upcoming general elections.
The top court noted that in the Bhutto case, the composition of the bench was such that even a single judge's opinion was significant and valuable.
During the proceedings, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa expressed concern over the controversial case where an individual's fate was sealed by a majority vote among judges.
He emphasised the need to rectify this chapter of history, noting that the stain left behind pertains not just to a family but also affects the credibility of institutions.
“In seeking justice, we aim not only to restore an individual’s honour but also to correct history. The court will set a better example,” the CJP said while addressing the controversial 1979 death sentence case.
The larger bench, headed by CJP Qazi Faez Isa, includes Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Yahya Afridi, Justice Aminud Din Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, and Justice Musarrat Hilali.

Bilawal Bhutto and Aseefa Bhutto Zardari, Raza Rabbani, Farooq H Naek and Attorney General Mansoor Awan were also present in the courtroom.
""Is it within the court's purview to declare that no one should be punished for an accomplice's admission of guilt?"" the CJP questioned.
Judicial Assistant Makhdoom Ali Khan asserted that the constitutional safeguard of life and property, as enshrined in Article 4 of the Constitution, is as an inalienable fundamental right. He argued that the presidential reference is admissible when Article 186 is viewed within the context of Article IV.
Makhdoom Ali Khan highlighted that rectifying the court's decision is not the issue, as the verdict cannot be altered. However, he emphasised the grave impact of the flawed justice system on both the court's integrity and the convicted individual's legal heirs.
He read out an excerpt from author Rafi Raza's book 'Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Pakistan,' citing an interview where the former attorney general Sharifuddin Pirzada labelled the judicial proceedings as fraudulent and biased.
Later, the CJP adjourned the case's hearing until the third week of February.

1,Naqvi withdraws objections to SC bench,Top court reserves order on plea seeking removal of Justice Ijazul Ahsan from SJC,"Lawyers representing Supreme Court judge Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi withdrew their objections on Monday to the bench hearing Justice Naqvi’s petition against misconduct proceedings initiated by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
The SJC, on October 27 last year, issued a show cause notice to Justice Naqvi amid various complaints alleging bench manipulation and financial misconduct by the SC judge.
Subsequently, on November 22, a second show cause notice was served by the SJC, demanding a detailed response from the judge regarding the allegations raised by multiple petitioners.
In response, Justice Naqvi challenged the SJC proceedings and its notices in the apex court, which then formed a three-member bench to address the matter. The bench included Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, and Justice Mussarat Hilali.
Initially, Justice Naqvi objected to the formation of this bench, which according to a note issued by one of the SJC members, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, was not formed in consultation with a three-member committee formed in light of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
However, on Monday, Naqvi’s lawyers—Makhdoom Ali Khan and Latif Khosa—expressed complete confidence in the bench and retracted their objections.
During the hearing, Justice Mandokhail remarked on the prevalence of derogatory remarks about judges on social media and referenced an allegedly attributed statement from a judge's daughter, highlighted as breaking news.
""Any Tom, Dick, and Harry lodges complaints against judges. People ridicule the judiciary, and nobody is holding them accountable,"" he said. ""Judges cannot even respond to these allegations. They do not have a media cell or an office to address such accusations.""
 The court observed that Justice Naqvi had not named the individuals who filed complaints against him with the SJC as respondents in the case, a unique occurrence that warrants examination.
Mukhdoom Ali Khan argued that once a complainant submits a grievance to the SJC, their role terminates. He contended that the council's actions, termed administrative, can be halted by a Supreme Court bench, citing precedents.
He further alleged that the SJC failed to meet legal requirements before issuing show cause notices to Naqvi, suggesting they were based on assumptions rather than facts. Justice Mandokhail asked as to who will determine whether the show cause notices were based on facts or assumptions.
The bench also reserved its order on a petition by complainant Mian Dawood, seeking the removal of Justice Ijazul Ahsan from the SJC bench handling complaints against Justice Naqvi.
Dawood, present in the courtroom, stated that when he requested Justice Ahsan's recusal, the SJC member refused to step down from hearing the complaints against Naqvi.
Justice Mandokhail noted the principle that a judge facing objections should decide on their own recusal in judicial decisions. The court adjourned until today (Tuesday).

2,The blatant case of political expediency,"PML-N jubilant, PTI feels aggrieved over SC verdict","The Supreme Court decision to overturn lifetime disqualification has not only paved the way for the political heavyweights to make a comeback in parliamentary politics but, apparently, set the rule for the future that political battles are best contested in the political arena even if one faces technical knockout for five years.
The reaction on top court’s ruling, which has opened the window for the ex-premier Nawaz Sharif, the chairman of the newly-formed Ishtehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP), Jahangir Khan Tareen, among others, to contest polls and return to Parliament, was divided as PML-N was jubilant but PTI felt that ‘convicted’ can but those booked in ‘false’ cases can’t contest polls.
Eminent scholar Professor Dr Hassan Askari while talking to The Express Tribune expressed that a lifetime ban or disqualifying someone from holding an elective office appeared unjust. The professor, however, said it wasn’t clear yet if anyone else other than Nawaz and Tareen would immediately benefit from the decision, saying PTI’s founding chairman Imran Khan might benefit a few years down the lane.
Not so long ago, Professor Askari recalled that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) pursued cases against Nawaz but, following his return to the country from London, it is the same anti-graft body which admitted before the courts that there was nothing against Nawaz with them.
“It raises the question if the earlier court decision were made in accordance with law or as per the political convenience back then,” Professor Askari said.
Referring to a pattern where one side starts getting relief while the other is punished after a certain period of time, the professor said that it seems that “it is less about legal, constitutional and principal of justice and more about political expediency for the time being.”
Usually, he said, politicians are not in favour of a lifetime ban, saying they should try to show their true potential in the political arena instead of knocking out their opponents on technical grounds.
Professor Tahir Naeem Malik of NUML University noted that the top court’s decision has provided relief to a few but it has once again exposed the system where one starts getting relief or vice versa if it’s decided. He, however, said that things are always different for elite and common citizens.
Surprisingly, Professor Malik recalled that the whole system, including courts and the judgments, create a scenario, saying moral and religious connotations are given; couplets and adages are narrated in legal documents; words like “Sicilian mafia” and “pity the nation” are used by judges and then everything is somehow forgotten. “They simply say that we overlooked and move on,” Malik said.
However, Professor Malik noted that Nawaz appeared to be a “lucky man” as he has always managed to make a comeback, saying one reason was that “politicians belonging to Punjab are more pragmatic and they agitate against the establishment to a certain extent and do not go beyond that limit.”
Malik said that Nawaz also knew when to agitate and when to stay silent, saying “It seems his silence has paid off”. However, he added, that ex-premier Imran Khan didn’t care if he was crossing any line and simultaneously opened too many fronts for himself.
Following the apex court’s decision pertaining to disqualification, Malik said a decision was also expected in Bhutto’s case as Monday’s decision has added extra pressure on the judiciary that some people are getting justice or relief in their lives while others have been waiting for decades.
Political reactions
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif labelled today's verdict as ""historic"" and declared the demise of the conspiracy aimed at disqualifying Nawaz Sharif for life through an ""arbitrary interpretation of the Constitution.""
""There is no longer any legal obstacle in the way of Nawaz Sharif to participate in the elections,"" he affirmed. Shehbaz further stated that if the PML-N leader were afforded another opportunity, he would steer the country towards a trajectory of development and prosperity.
Meanwhile, PML-N leader Marriyum Aurangzeb expressed that a ""dark chapter"" had concluded, contending that the lifelong disqualification was intended to subject Nawaz to political vendetta.
She elaborated, stating that the interpretation of Article 62(1)(f) had led Pakistan and its citizens into the quagmire of inflation, economic deterioration, and international shame.
Conversely, the PTI vehemently reacted to the SC’s decision, asserting that irrespective of Nawaz Sharif's qualification or disqualification, the electorate of Pakistan is poised to reject him in the upcoming February 8 election.
Taking to microblogging platform ‘X’, the PTI stated, “InshAllah, the people of Pakistan will reject Nawaz Sharif, along with all the privileges he presently enjoys. The nation has endured enough hardship due to the influence wielded by this favoured scion, Ladla Sharif!""
Characterising the court's decision as a regrettable departure from 'honouring the vote' to a state of being 'we are done,' PTI underscored its disapproval.
Furthermore, the party disseminated a video clip featuring Imran Khan, who emphasised that Pakistan's fundamental predicament lies in the absence of the rule of law.
Imran stressed that a just society requires equality before the law, bemoaning the prevailing scenario in the nation where significant wrongdoers often escape justice, thereby jeopardising the prosperity of great nations.

4,Govt hardens stance on ‘ghost article’,Imran says ‘verbally dictated’ piece published in The Economist,"The caretaker government on Monday toughened its stance on a piece published in The Economist by incarcerated PTI chief Imran Khan, describing it as “ghost article” as the latter said he had verbally dictated his guest essay.
A guest essay attributed to Imran in British publication on January 4 indicated that he had serious doubts about whether the upcoming elections would be held or not.
The piece reiterated his allegations about how a regime change brought about after US government pressure led to a vote of no-confidence against him last year and described the May 9 riots as a “false-flag operation” which was “pre-planned”.
“It is not an issue that someone cannot write an article or a book while languishing in jail. We have the objection that the article in question has not been written by the former PTI chairman,” the minister said while speaking in a current affairs programme of the Pakistan Television.
Solani said no such content was leaked from the jail to any media organisation and The Economist published the “ghost article” in the name of the former Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman.
Meanwhile, during a hearing on the Toshakhana and Al-Qadir Trust cases in Adiala Jail on Monday, the PTI founder was questioned by journalists about whether he wrote the essay.
“I own the column published in an international journal. I had given verbal guidelines regarding the column. The article was written and published as a result of these guidelines. I had verbally dictated the article,” Imran told reporters.
The PTI chief did, however, say that it was “the age of artificial intelligence”, adding that next week, a speech of his would also arrive on social media.

5,Naqvi's bid to halt SJC rejected,SC directs judge to also name people who filed complaints against him as respondents,"The Supreme Court has once again dismissed Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Naqvi's plea to halt the ongoing misconduct proceedings at the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
The court has also asked the apex court judge to name the people who accused him of manipulating benches and financial wrongdoings as respondents in the case.
On Tuesday, a three-member bench led by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Musarrat Hilali resumed hearing Justice Naqvi's petition.
During the proceedings, Justice Mandokhail noted that Naqvi, in his constitutional petition, contended that the complaints lodged against him at the SJC are based on mala fide intentions.
""How can we determine whether the petitions are filed with a mala fide intention or not without hearing the complainants?” he asked.
At the last hearing of the case, on Monday, the court had expressed wonder that Justice Naqvi had not arrayed the complainants as respondents.
Naqvi's lawyer Makhdoom Ali Khan referred to Justice Qazi Faez Isa case, in which, according to him, the complainants were not named as respondents.
Justice Aminuddin Khan, however, took exception to this claim, stating that Justice Isa had named the complainants including the Assets Recovery Unit as respondents.
Makhdoom Ali Khan said that when the SJC decided to issue the first show cause to Naqvi on October 27, it had dismissed 21 other complaints filed against other judges without hearing those petitioners.
""If the complainants in Justice Naqvi's case are named as respondents then all the people whose complaints were rejected without giving them a hearing will file petitions against the move under Article 184 (3),"" Khan argued.
Justice Aminuddin Khan observed that the Supreme Court is now adjudicating the matter.
""The court believes that the complainants should be first issued notices. Otherwise, the proceedings cannot move forward,"" he said.

The lawyer argued that if the court opened its doors to the complainants in this case then a lot of people will rush to the top court with complaints against judges.
Justice Aminuddin Khan emphasized that it is the judges, not the complainants, who have approached this court. “The court might have proceeded further had the complainants not been mentioned in your petition.""
Justice Mandokhail said the court's position is that it cannot make a decision without hearing the complainants, adding that justice should not only be done but also seen to be done.
“We do not want to give everyone a free pass to point the finger at judges. Either the complaint in the council should be so substantial and comprehensive that no judge can escape it, or the council should take strict action against baseless complaints.
“There should be no middle ground. There is a lot of money in lawyering; people become judges due to the respect associated with the position,” he said.
The court later asked Justice Naqvi to file an amended petition by naming the complainants as respondents. When the lawyer for Naqvi requested the bench to stay the proceedings of the SJC, Justice Aminuddin replied that they had not heard the merits of the case so far.
“We will decide on issuing or not issuing a stay order on the SJC proceedings after hearing the case on merit,” he said. Interestingly, the SJC is going to resume its misconduct proceedings against Justice Naqvi tomorrow, on January 11.

8,NAB closes investigation into Sharif trust case,"Nawaz, his family members were accused of committing corruption in name of trust","The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has closed the investigation against Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Quaid Nawaz Sharif and his family members in the Sharif trust case.
Nawaz, who was elected the prime minister of Pakistan thrice in his political career, returned to the country in Oct 2023 after four years of self-imposed exile in London to restart his political journey ahead of the general elections scheduled for Feb 8.
Nawaz was ousted in 2017, during his third stint as the prime minister of Pakistan and in 2018 was sentenced to a seven-year prison term on multiple charges of corruption. In 2019, he was released on bail due to his health problems and allowed to seek treatment.
The anti-graft body on Tuesday gave the approval to stop five inquiries, including investigation into the Sharif trust case against the former prime minister and his family members, which were given the green-light in the executive board meeting held on Jan 1.

In the executive board meeting held here, the inquiries approved for closure include Punjab Safe City Authority, Social Action Programme, Park Enclave and others.
The investigation into the Sharif trust case against Nawaz and his family members has also been closed after being approved on Jan 1.
In the executive board meeting, it was informed that the approval of the investigation into the Sharif trust case was ongoing since March 31, 2000, in which it was alleged that the Sharif family members had created benami property in the name of the trust and the accounts of the trust were tampered with and also no audit was conducted.
Apart from this, in the Sharif trust case, the Sharif family members were accused of secretly receiving millions of rupees in the name of the trust.
After the approval in the meeting, NAB closed the investigation into Sharif trust case under Section 31B of the National Accountability (Amendment) Act, 2022.
The amended law gives the NAB chairman authority to close the inquiries started under any other law.
