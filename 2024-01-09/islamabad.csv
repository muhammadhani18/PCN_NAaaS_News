He said that the campaign is being organised across Punjab starting today. He said that Punjab has been free from polio since October 2020, but the migrant population is a constant risk here.
To eliminate this risk, he said that special vaccination points have been established at entry and exit points. He said that there are 18 union councils that are near the drains and nullahs and 38 high-risk union councils in Rawalpindi.
Special teams have been deployed in high-risk union councils. Efforts should be made to cover refusals and non-attended cases on the same day.

He said that one million children will be given the polio vaccine in Rawalpindi and that parents must give the polio vaccine to every child under five years of age.
Dr. Jamal Nasir said that no case of polio has been reported in Punjab since 2020. Thanks to continuous efforts, polio has been eradicated from the whole world except for two countries, and in those two countries, polio still exists today, and these countries are Pakistan and Afghanistan. He said that polio workers are our valuable asset, and despite the severe cold, polio workers are rendering services in remote areas.

3,Police chief asked to get G-6 flats vacated: ministry,"At least 200 apartments in Aabpara illegally occupied by police, govt officials","ISALAMBAD: The Ministry of Interior on Monday informed the Senate that the Islamabad police chief has been asked to get at least 200 flats constructed by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) in Sector G-6 vacated from the illegal occupation of the police officials and officials of other government departments.
Senator Mohsin Aziz had asked the ministry about the occupation of these flats.
“Will the minister for interior be pleased to state whether it is a fact that flats constructed for government employees in Sector G-6, near Aabpara Market, have illegally been occupied by trespassers, if so, the action taken by the government in the matter so far?” the senator had asked.
In response to his question, the ministry informed in writing on Jan 2: “Yes, as per the record, 200 flats constructed by CDA in Aabpara, Sector G-6, are illegally occupied by ICT Police officials and other federal government departments. The authority[CDA] has taken up the matter with the quarters concerned to get the possession. The authority also contested the matter before the Islamabad High Court. The matter was finally decided by the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad in ICA vide order dated 13-02-2023,” read the reply of the interior ministry.
The CDA and the interior ministry’s reply while quoting the IHC judgment stated: “The Inspector General of Police as well as the secretary of the Ministry of Interior are directed to register the criminal cases against all the officials/ employees of the police department, who have illegally occupied the flats by force with further directions to Inspector General of Police, Islamabad to initiate departmental action against all the occupants…and shall submit a compliance report before this court within period of one month, failing which, the secretary of the Ministry of Interior and Inspector General of Police, Islamabad shall be dealt strictly in accordance with the law.”

At least 200 apartments in Aabpara illegally occupied by police, govt officials

The reply stated that in light of the IHC abovementioned judgement, the matter was taken up with the Ministry of Interior with a request to pass on directions to the IG to handover the possession of the flats to the CDA to enable the authority to allot the accommodation in question to its employees who are waiting for the same for so many years.
It said that a reminder in this regard was also issued to the Ministry of Interior on Sept 20, 2023. “In response to the CDA letter, the Ministry of Interior has taken up the matter with the Ministry of Housing and Works and the Islamabad chief commissioner. The Ministry of Housing endorsed the directions of IHC. Finally, the Ministry of Interior issued directions to the Inspector General of Police for compliance,” read the reply.
The CDA had constructed the said flats near Aabpara Market to hand these over to the housing ministry for onward allotment to government officials. The terms and conditions with the housing ministry were not decided regarding these flat when the 2005 earthquake occurred. Subsequently, the survivors and displaced people were shifted to the said flats.
During the Lal Masjid operation in 2007, police officials started living in the said flats and till today, police personnel and many other government employees were residing there illegally.
The CDA officials said that they have taken up this matter with the interior ministry several times as the IHC last year had clearly directed for the vacation of these flats. “Now, we are told that the interior ministry has asked the police high-ups to get these flats vacated,” said a deputy director of the CDA.

4,IHRA issues advisory on new Covid sub-variant,Available limited evidence does not suggest that the associated disease severity is higher as compared to other circulating variants.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad Healthcare Regulatory Authority (IHRA) has issued an advisory regarding new sub-variant of Covid-19 i.e. JN.1 of Omicron to ensure timely preventive and control measures encompassing preparedness to deal with increased workload expected in the outpatient and inpatient departments during next few weeks.
It stated that Covid-19 virus genome had consistently changed over the course of the pandemic, resulting in variants that were different from the original Covid-19 virus.
“World Health Organisation (WHO) has classified these mutations as either Variant of Interest (VoI) with genetic changes that are predicted or known to affect virus characteristics such as transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, diagnostic or therapeutic escape; and identified to cause significant community transmission or multiple clusters of infected persons. Variant of Concern (VoC) associated with changes at a degree of global public health significance like increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in Covid-19 epidemiology,” it said in a statement.
“JN1 is classified as VoI and fundamentally an offshoot of BA.2.86 sub-variant Omicron variant of Covid-19 virus, very first reported in August, 2023 by US-CDC. However, in recent weeks JN1 has been reported in many countries and its prevalence is rapidly increasing globally. This rapid growth is observed across the three WHO regions with consistent sharing of SARS-CoV-2 sequences i.e. the region of the Americas, Western Pacific and the European regions, with the largest increase seen in Western Pacific,” it stated.
Although JN1 was rapidly replacing over other sub-variants and its transmissibility was expected to be high but it was unlikely that it can produce a situation like earlier phase of pandemic, hence its morbidity and mortality was low as of current statistics.
“Clinical presentation of JN1infection is similar to other sub­-variants, including cough, sore throat, congestion, runny nose, sneezing, fatigue, headache, muscle aches and altered sense of smell. However, symptoms presentation depend on individual’s immunity from vaccination and previous infection. It’s important to know that existing vaccines, tests, and treatments still work well against JN1,” it stated.
Despite a rapid increase in JN1 infections, available limited evidence does not suggest that the associated disease severity is higher as compared to other circulating variants. Currently, available vaccines also offer same protection against JN1 sub-variants as with other variants.
Prevention and control measures
IHRA has suggested that if someone is sick or has been in close contact with persons having flu-like illness, they should adopt the following preventive measures for limiting the Covid-19 transmission.
“Frequent and thorough hand washing with soap and water and use of hand sanitizer if soap and water are unavailable, to opt for respiratory etiquettes through covering mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing with elbow, sick patients to stay at home, take rest and avoid crowds, taking social distancing measures until recovery. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection and its severe outcomes particularly in high risk groups. The more antibodies with complete vaccine dose or booster shots, the greater the chances of reducing Covid-19 infection specially among high risk groups including elderly population people with co-morbidities and people working in high risk settings,” it suggests.

To highlight issues of people of Indian occupied Kashmir, the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and universities decided to set up ‘Kashmir Learning Centres’ to advance the study and research on Kashmir, especially with respect to the issue of Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).
The centres will be set up in all public and private universities of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan. In first step, these centres will be set up in AJK based both public and private universities followed by their establishment in Pakistan’s universities.
This decision was made during physical and virtual interactive sessions with Vice Chancellors by Prime Minister’s Special Assistant on Human Rights and Women Empowerment Mushaal Hussein Mullick.
According to a press release issued by HEC on Monday, around 150 heads of the higher education institutions expressed their views about the role of academia in creating understanding of the Kashmir cause.
Chairman Higher Education Commission (HEC) Dr Mukhtar Ahmed, Executive Director HEC Dr Ziaul Qayyum, HEC Commission Member Dr Ehsanullah Kakar also attended the session.
According to the press release, speaking on the occasion, SAPM Ms Mullick underlined that the Kashmir issue has a deep connection to peace in South Asia and the emotions of Pakistani people. “Where the political, religious and human rights voices of Kashmir are being silenced by the coercive forces, we have to become the voice of Kashmir,” she emphasised.

He stated this after visiting the camp office at Khalsa Khurd for the Ring Road Project. On this occasion, the commissioner took a briefing on the progress of work on the ring road project and inspected the work by visiting the by-road from Khasala Khudarad to Thalian Interchange.
Officials from Nespak and FWO gave a briefing. Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chatta said that the ring road project will be completed before the stipulated period. So far, 15 percent of the construction work on the project has been completed.
He said that the names of the interchanges built on the ring road should be named after the village. Five interchanges, 11 overhead bridges on rivers, nullahs, rain channels, and railway tracks, and 15 underpasses and 53 bridges would be constructed. They said that a rest area will also be built on the ring road.
Mr. Chatta said that the Ring Road Project is not less than a gift for the people of Rawalpindi; this project will provide employment to the local people. He said that no society coming on the Ring Road project will be given way.
The 38.3 km Ring Road will have five interchanges at Baanth, Chak Beli Khan, Adiala Road, Chakri Road, and Thalian. An industrial zone will also be established around the road. The total cost of the project is Rs 31.7 billion — Rs 23 billion for construction and Rs 6.7 billion for land acquisition, while the remaining will be used for shifting services and other expenditures.
During the PTI government, two routes were planned for the project, and later work was started on the main carriageway from Baanth on Grand Trunk Road to Thallian on the motorway. Former prime minister Imran Khan laid the foundation stone of the road at Thallian in March 2022. The FWO was awarded the contract. The PDM government temporarily halted the project and gave the go-ahead after carrying out a third-party validation of the route.
Former prime minister Shahbaz Sharif had directed the authorities to seek a third-party consultant to validate the optimal route. 
A joint venture of Turkish and Pakistani firms was tasked with selecting the route from Baanth to Thallian. After getting its report, Mr Sharif also laid the foundation of the road at Rawat on August 8 of this year.

9,Interior ministry voids promotions by IGP,Letter says officers promoted in clear violation of instructions issued by Establishment Division,"ISLAMABAD: A tug of war between the bureaucracy and the Islamabad Inspector General of Police over rules governing the capital police has started again after the interior ministry declared the promotion of grade 17 officers to grade 18 by the IGP null and void. 
As a result, the career of several ex-cadre police officers of the capital is also hanging in balance. According to a letter issued by the Ministry of Interior, it had been informed that the IGP had promoted officers from BS-17 to BS-18 in May 2023 without any legal authority and in clear violation of instructions issued by the Establishment Division and the controlling ministry.
“I am directed to convey that the competent authority has taken cognisance of the above-mentioned irregularity and the same has been declared null and void,” the letter said, adding that further necessary action may be taken accordingly.
The IGP promulgated the Police Order 2002 in the capital last year, but so far a notification has not been issued by the authorities concerned. The order also has not been approved by the president or parliament. After the promulgation of the Police Order, the police chief has been issuing orders and taking decisions in light of this order, but only to the extent of his department. 
In 2023, several grade-16 (inspector) and grade-17 (Deputy Superintendent of Police) officers were promoted to grade-17 and grade-18 (Superintendent of Police) through the Departmental Promotion Committee constituted under the Police Order 2002, by the IGP, said officials.

Letter says officers promoted in clear violation of instructions issued by Establishment Division 

It may be noted that the disagreement between the Islamabad chief commissioner and the police chief over rules governing the capital police amplified in June after the former approached the interior ministry seeking its intervention to settle the matter regarding the police rules.
The chief commissioner’s office and the Accountant General Pakistan Revenue (AGPR) have, however, taken exception to his decisions and asked the IGP to follow the Police Rules.
In a similar vein, the commissioner’s office in June also asked the ministry to issue necessary instructions regarding the law, policy, and procedures, said officials, adding that the ministry was also requested to declare the IGP’s “unlawful” decisions null and void.
Sources said the IGP chaired a meeting of the Departmental Promotion Committee for the promotion of the DSP to the SP on June 2 despite the objections raised by the commissioner’s office on June 1.
The commissioner’s office had asked the IGP office to work under the Police Rules and get the officers promoted through the DPC of the interior ministry, the officials said, adding that the police chief exercised the powers given in Police Order 2002 and conducted the DPC proceedings.
The joint secretary of the ministry and a representative of the commissioner’s office did not attend the meeting held under the Police Order 2002 despite the request of the IGP office, the officials added.
It is pertinent to mention that the departmental promotion/selection committees for the posts of BPS-17 and BPS-18 in Islamabad police had already been notified by the interior ministry on April 3 after the consent of the Establishment Division.
The cases for promotion of DSP to SP were required to be forwarded to the ministry for consideration by the DPC and the Departmental Selection Committee (DSC) headed by the additional secretary, the letter said.
According to the letter, it was also brought to the notice that the IGP had reconstituted the DP/SC for promotion of ministerial staff up to BS-16 without approval from the competent authority and a DPC meeting in this regard was convened on May 31, 2023.
In light of these decisions, the ministry was asked to issue necessary instructions regarding the observance of the law, policy, and procedures, the letter said, asking it to void the decisions taken by the IGP without observance of the law.
The officials said the AGPR had also asked the IGP to send pension cases of retired ex-cadre officials with the approval of the interior secretary under the Police Rules. However, the police continued to send these cases with the signature of the IGP under the Police Order 2002.
In February, the IGP appointed DIG Awais Ahmed as the DIG Operations under the Police Order 2002. But the chief commissioner rejected the order and appointed another officer Shahzad Nadeem as the DIG Operations under thePoliceRules.

The council was responding to recent reports circulating in media that the provincial quota of public and private-sector medical and dental colleges was being increased by 20pc.
The PMDC categorically announced that the provincial quota could not be increased without its approval, and that a proper application had to be submitted through the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS).
According to media reports, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government has decided to increase the number of seats in the public and private medical and dental colleges by 20pc, and caretaker KP Chief Minister retired Justice Syed Arshad Hussain Shah has said the matter had been taken up with the PMDC.
However, the council on Monday issued a statement claiming that no seat enhancement was possible in the medical and dental colleges without its approval.
“In the larger interest of the organisation it is clarified that the PMDC has received no application from the KP government nor the PMDC has inked an approval for any such seat enhancement. Provincial/regional authorities can enhance their seats in medical and dental colleges with due approval of the PMDC which is the apex regulatory body of the country,” it stated.
It is pertinent to mention here that the PMDC has a set criteria, rules, regulations and standards in line with the global commitments for its recognition with the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME).
“Recognition of MBBS/BDS programmes and enhancement of seats is done under a due procedure which includes formal requests by provincial governments or individual colleges through the Ministry of Health. The PMDC is a national regulatory body and according to law, no province can work or announce any enhancement independently. 
The PMDC firmly disseminates that seat enhancement in public or private colleges is subject to completion of the due process,” the statement said.

12,Minister praises contribution of private sector to education,TAXILA: Caretaker Minister for National Heritage and Culture Jamal Shah on Monday said private educational...,"TAXILA: Caretaker Minister for National Heritage and Culture Jamal Shah on Monday said private educational institutions were sharing the burden of the government. 
He said provision of education was a constitutional obligation of the government, but it could not be achieved single-handedly without the support of the private sector. 
The caretaker minister was speaking as chief guest at a prize distribution ceremony after an inter-school debating competition organised by Sir Syed Education Foundation of Pakistan at Hassanabdal on Monday.
Students from different educational institutions of Taxila, Wah, Hassanabdal, Khanpur and Haripur proved their mettle in the competition. 
The caretaker minister said it was a fact that over 90 per cent of parents enroll their children in private schools as such intuitions assess the performance of every student individually. 
He said the establishment of standard private educational institutions creates a spirit of competition in government educational institutions also which was a must for the development of society. 
Mr Shah said the culture ministry was about to launch a heritage channel dedicated to showcasing folk heritage of the country. 
Speaking on the occasion, PPP leader Sardar Zulfiqar Hayat Khan said today the world recognises nations through their contributions in the fields of science and research. He said a strong nation occupies a weak nation for its wealth. Students and youth are the future of the country and they should realise their responsibilities.
Ahmed Masood, a great-great-grandson of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, called for revival of the ideology of education as envisioned by Sir Syed. He urged students to gain knowledge, focus on their character development and uphold morality and truth to make Pakistan a strong and prosperous nation. 
He asked the teachers to focus on strengthening the character of students and teachers must play an effective role in classrooms in this regard.
Sir Syed Education Foundation President Prof Tahir Durrani said Sir Syed introduced the thought of Islamic culture in the subcontinent and promoted the idea of getting western education without affecting religious doctrines and character. 
“To achieve these goals, he established an institute that imparted modern education to the Muslims focusing on character building.” 
He said the foundation was working on these lines to equip students with quality education through over 15 campuses mostly in rural areas. 
Eminent scientist Dr Azhar Muneer, former director Air Weapons Complex (AWC), and former chief executive officer (education) Rawalpindi Qazi Zahoorul Haq were also present.
