Ms Sheikh, elected as an MPA on a PML-N ticket in 2013, faced disqualification in 2015 after a petition filed by Maulana Mohammad Ahmed Ludhianvi, the chief of Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat, accusing her of concealing her assets.
Expressing her joy after the SC decision, Ms Sheikh stated that she is now eligible to contest the upcoming Feb 8 elections from her constituency.  
Her husband, Yaqoob Sheikh, also a contestant, had gone through a series of political affiliations, initially leaving PML-N, then joining the PML-N again after quitting PTI and joining the Istehkam Pakistan Party.

7,"Business facilitation centres to be launched in Gujranwala, Sialkot",Three other major cities will also have BFCs soon,"

_Dawn

 
GUJRAT: The Punjab government is going to launch Business Facilitation Centres (BFCs) in Gujranwala, Sialkot and three other major cities of the province in the next couple of weeks. 
The BFCs will feature the counters of at least 18 departments of the provincial government, where no objection certificates (NOCs), required for starting news businesses, will be issued under one roof within 10 to 15 days of submitting applications. 
The applicants would be able to get at least 110 types of NOCs to be issued by different departments at these BFCs. 
The caretaker Punjab Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi is likely to inaugurate the BFCs in Gujranwala and Sialkot, which are part of the ‘golden industrial triangle’, by January 10 and 11, respectively, a senior administrative official of Gujranwala region told Dawn on Saturday. 
He says the BFCs in both the cities are being completed speedily, adding that the Gujranwala centre is being established in a hall located in the compound of the commissioner’s office, whereas that of Sialkot is being set up in Anwaar Club Auditorium, that has been lying vacant for long. 

Three other major cities will also have BFCs soon

The establishment of BFCs in major cities of the province is an initiative of provincial industries department. After successful launch of the BFC in Lahore, the government has decided to expand the initiative to at least five more cities of the province. 
Industries department Secretary Ehsan Bhutta, who paid a visit to the BFCs being set up in Gujranwala and Sialkot, told Dawn that apart from these two centres, such facilities are also being set up in Rawalpindi, Faisalabad and Multan. 
He said the training of at least 50 staffers belonging to 18 different departments has already been launched, adding that these officials will be initially posted in the BFCs in the five major cities. They are being trained with the assistance of the Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (Tevta) in Lahore. 
He said the caretaker Prime Minister Anwarul Haq Kakkar and Punjab CM had also commended the initiative. 
Punjab, he said, had requested the federal government to approve the setting up of help desks of various federal departments, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA), Security Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) etc, as well at the BFCs for the convenience of business fraternity. 
Earlier, Gujranwala Commissioner Naveed Haider Sheerazi, DC Fayaz Mohal and Sialkot DC Muhammad Zulqarnain also briefed the industries secretary about the progress on the work being done to set up BFCs in the two cities.

8,Schoolteacher burnt in acid attack in Shahdara,LAHORE: Two men allegedly threw acid on the face of a young woman in Shahdara area here on Monday.,"LAHORE: Two men allegedly threw acid on the face of a young woman in Shahdara area here on Monday.
The woman (A) was a school teacher and she was rushed to a local hospital due to severe and deep burns.
The police claimed to have arrested both the suspects from the premises of the Lahore International Airport.
A police official said one of the attackers wanted to marry the woman but her parents had rejected the proposal.  
On Monday, he said, the suspect along with his accomplice stopped the woman and threw acid on her face.  
Both the suspects had already completed documents to flee abroad, the police official said, adding that they reached the airport shortly after committing the crime.
The police traced them with the help of the CCTV footage and the mobile phone call records and arrested them from the premises of the airport.  
Further investigations have been launched.
In yet another incident, a young girl fell from the rooftop of a coffee shop in Defence Housing Authority (DHA) and got multiple injuries.

9,Campaign against unlicenced drivers   exposes police excesses,Youngsters being locked up with hardened criminals; CTO expresses utter displeasure at the situation,"LAHORE:  Abid is a first year student who faced the highhandedness of the  traffic police in the name of the ongoing campaign against unlicenced  drivers when he was stopped by a warden on The Mall. He was having a  learners licence and complete documents of his motorcycle.  
“I  was stopped by a warden near Alfalah Building on The Mall. I showed him  my learners licence but he said he needed to get the document verified  in the police station,” he told Dawn. 
“As we both reached  the police station, the warden handed me over to the Punjab  Police,” Abid says, adding that a policeman snatched from him his mobile  phone and the keys to his bike before locking him up. 
Later, he  came to know that he had been charged with ‘one-way’ violation. Luckily,  a police official gave him his mobile phone and allowed him to inform  his family. 
“I spent the night in the lock-up. Police demanded  from my father, Muhammad Aslam, Rs6,000, saying the amount would be paid  for the bail to the lawyer who was also present in the police station  at that time,” the teenager says. 

Youngsters being locked up with hardened criminals; CTO expresses utter displeasure at the situation 

Abid is not alone who had to  face the ordeal since the campaign against underage drivers and unlicenced riders started by the traffic police in Lahore. The wardens, according to some reports, are sending 50 to 100 youngsters  behind bars in each police station everyday on average. There  are allegations that the young drivers, most of them student  motorcyclists, are being locked up despite having learners licences and  documents of their vehicles. A disturbing aspect of the whole activity  is that young and even underage riders are kept in the lock-up with  hardened criminals and murder suspects, making them potential victims of  the criminals.
“A traffic warden stopped me at a service lane near Regal Chowk at 4:45pm on Sunday,” Abdul Rasheed (22) said. 
On  showing his learners licence on his phone record, the warden expressed  doubt over its authenticity and took him to the police station. A police  official handed him over a copy of an FIR wherein it was written “the  traffic warden arrested the suspect over one-way violation after a brief  struggle”. It was shocking for Rasheed as he had followed the  instructions of the warden. 
Another young man, Mehtab (23) said he had a learners licence when a warden approached him at the Regal Chowk traffic signal. Two wardens took him to the police station where he was booked for one-way violation. 
“I  was wearing a helmet and had a learners licence when the warden stopped  me on The Mall,” another 1st year student, Muhammad Dawood (22),  said. 
He repeated the same story of verification of licence and  FIR over one-way violation. The young man added that about 40 other youngsters were sharing the same lock-up with him besides the drug  addicts, suspected murderers and other criminals. 
Some parents,  who did not want to be named, say the city traffic police are spoiling  the future of youngsters, particularly of students, by sending them the  lock-ups just to please the police authorities by showing ‘a high number  of registered cases’.  
It is evident from the recent reports that the  wardens are unnecessarily targeting a majority of those young  motorcyclists who have learner licences and registration of their bikes.  
The number of such victim youngsters, particularly students, is  reported to be unexpectedly high, forcing their parents or relatives to  visit police stations to follow the cases and arrange for their bails.  In most cases, lawyers are provided by police officials at the police  stations, who allegedly get their own percentage in the lawyers’ fee  that parents pay.  
Babar, the father of such a victim, a resident  of Chungi Amar Sidhu, said that he spent more than Rs10,000 in two days  while his son, a first year student, spent the night in lock-up before  he got his bail next day.  
A rush of parents outside police  stations has become the order of the day where they are seen carrying  blankets, pillows and warm garments for their kids to spend chilly  nights in the lock-up. It’s common knowledge that our police lock-ups  have no facilities whatsoever for those in custody.  
Many youngsters Dawn spoke  to were taken by the wardens to the two police stations of Mozang and  Civil Lines for registration of cases. These stations are among 85  others where a large number of young bike riders are locked up daily. 
A  majority of the young men revealed shocking stories of the traffic  wardens and ‘the tactics’ they used before getting the cases lodged  against them with the police stations. After registration of cases, the  youngsters were taken to the Crime Record Office (CRO) where police  would obtain their fingerprints, photos and other family details to make  them a part of the police record, a protocol followed for the habitual  criminals. 
The ‘victims’ said the traffic police, in connivance  with the police stations and lawyers, were charging from each youngster  Rs5,000 to Rs10,000 for special services, ‘a crime’ going unnoticed  since the launch of the campaign on the court order. They were told by  the police officials that the amount was being spent on their travel  expenses to produce them before the courts and hiring of lawyers. 
Lahore  Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Amara Athar expressed her utter displeasure  at the situation, saying she would not spare the officials if the  allegations of the misuse of authority proved true. She said that  according to the policy, the underage children would not be booked while  wardens were not allowed to lodge complaints against those having  learners licences. 
“We launched the drive with a prime goal of making the Lahore city roads free of fatal accidents,” she claimed.

The initial announcement for winter vacation was from Dec 18 to 31. However, the government decided to extend the winter break from Jan 1 to 9 due to the severe cold wave sweeping across the province.
After the holidays, primary, middle, high and higher secondary schools will open at 9:30am and close at 3:30pm.
Punjab caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed this on X (formerly Twitter), stating that all government institutions have ended their winter holidays and schools will reopen on Jan 10.
