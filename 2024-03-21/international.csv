0,Bugti urges militants to shun violance,"He stressed no one should be allowed to use force for pressing their demands since it is against religion, culture","Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti has extended a welcoming message to militants who have shunned violence and returned from the “darkness”. He emphasised the government’s readiness to offer comprehensive support to those who opt for peace and seek to join the mainstream.
The chief minister expressed his viewS while addressing a seminar titled ‘Balochistan Youth State Harmony Summit’ organised by the Balochistan University of Information Engineering and Management Sciences (BUITEMS) in collaboration with the Voice of Balochistan. MPA, Dr Rubaba Khan Buledi, former militant commander Sarfraz Banglazai, senior journalist and anchorperson Shahid Rind, BUITEMS Vice Chancellor Dr Khalid Hafeez were also part of the panel.
Addressing the participants, Bugti regretted the long-term incitement of animosity among the Balochistan youth.
He stressed the importance of separating perceptions from facts, saying “instead of telling the facts, anti-state elements tell anti-state stories on various issues and past events of the province.”
The only entity with the authority to use force against people who contest the legitimacy of the government is the state, he maintained, adding that no one should be allowed to use force for pressing their demands since it is against religion, customs, culture, and society.
Appreciating former militant commander Sarfraz Bangulzai’s surrender, the chief minister noted that although he was on the wrong track, the state welcomed him back into society. “Government will help every such individual who wants to join mainstream,” he said. About the impression of disgruntled Balochs, he said those who choose path of violence and take the lives of innocent citizen were not the disgruntled Baloch, but were the militants.
“There will be a gap between the state and the youth when jobs will be sold for money instead of merit, Bugti said, reiterating government resolve that no job will be sold in his tenure.

1,K-P to approach Centre for Rs53 billion dues,CM Gandapur entrusts finance advisor with retrieval task,"The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government is gearing up to reclaim its outstanding dues, totaling Rs53 billion over the past two years, from the federal government. 
This decision came to light during discussions led by Muzamil Aslam, Advisor to the Chief Minister on Finance, focusing on budgetary matters concerning the newly integrated districts within the province. Aslam shed light on the commitment made by the federal government in 2018 following the merger, promising an annual allocation of Rs66 billion for employee salaries and an additional Rs100 billion earmarked for expediting development projects in the region. 
However, these pledges remained unfulfilled, exacerbating financial strain on the province as its responsibilities expanded without commensurate resource growth.
Leading several meetings, Aslam reiterated the administration’s determination to invigorate the mining and mineral sector through strategic incentives aimed at attracting potential investors.
On March 17, Muzamil Aslam disclosed a disconcerting 50% decline in tax collection under the interim provincial government’s stewardship. He challenged the narrative propagated by the caretaker chief minister, refuting claims of an empty treasury. 
While acknowledging that the treasury wasn’t completely depleted, he pointed out the significant drop in tax revenues during the interim government’s tenure. Aslam criticized the discontinuation of the Sehat Card initiative despite ample funds available, also highlighting the substantial loans accumulated by the previous administration.
With regard to the newly amalgamated districts, Aslam lamented the failure to secure promised funds from the Centre, resulting in a notable increase in salaries, burdening the provincial coffers. He rebuked both the PDM and the caretaker government for their inaction in addressing this issue, emphasizing the pending dues for critical healthcare initiatives like the Sehat Card Plus.

2,"Bust open the head of corrupt officials, Gandapur tells public",He urged the people to take immediate action against bribe-seeking officials,"In a startling turn of events, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has stirred controversy by encouraging citizens to take matters into their own hands when faced with bribery demands from government officials.
According to a report by Express News, Gandapur advised the public to resort to violence, suggesting they throw bricks at officials who solicit bribes and then attribute the act to him.
Speaking at a public gathering in DI Khan’s village Syed Alian on Wednesday, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader made a brazen announcement against corruption, stating, “People! Hit a brick on the head of the officer asking for bribe and take my name… crack open the head of the officer or official of any department who asks for bribe. Do not be hellish yourself and do not make me one.”
Gandapur went on to emphasise that both the giver and taker of bribes are condemned according to Islamic teachings. He urged the people to take immediate action against bribe-seeking officials, advocating for on-the-spot punishment to uphold ‘honour’.
However, this endorsement of vigilante justice has drawn widespread criticism and raised concerns about its potential repercussions. By urging citizens to bypass legal channels and resort to violence, Gandapur’s statement could fuel a culture of lawlessness and vigilante retribution, opening the door to abuse and misuse of power.

3,Governor intervenes to call K-P Assembly,"Opposition leaders made request so that female, minority MPAs could take oath","Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Governor Haji Ghulam Ali has invoked his special powers to convene a provincial assembly meeting after the speaker refused to administer the oath to newly appointed women MPAs on reserved seats. In a rare move, the governor directed the assembly secretary to convene the session, scheduled for Friday afternoon at 3 o’clock. This marks the first instance of Governor Ghulam Ali utilizing his special authority to call an assembly session.
The decision to call a provincial assembly meeting stems from the speaker’s refusal to administer the oath to newly appointed women MPAs on reserved seats. Governor Ghulam Ali’s intervention reflects the urgency to address this issue, highlighting the importance of upholding democratic principles and ensuring the representation of marginalized groups within the legislative framework.

This move, however, has wider implications beyond the immediate context of oath-taking. It symbolizes a broader power struggle between the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-led provincial government and the federal government, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The rift between the two entities has become increasingly evident, with instances of political maneuvering and deliberate distancing observed in recent events.
One such instance occurred during Prime Minister Shehbaz’s visit to Peshawar, where K-P Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur notably abstained from official functions. This deliberate act of defiance highlights the underlying tension and lack of cooperation between the provincial and federal authorities.
It suggests a deep-seated discord that extends beyond ideological differences, posing significant challenges to effective governance and intergovernmental relations.
The implications of this rift are far-reaching, potentially impacting governance structures and public welfare initiatives in the region.
