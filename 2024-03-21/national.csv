0,"Pakistan seeks investment, not loans","PM asks friendly nations to pour capital, calls for harnessing youth potential","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has asked friendly countries that Pakistan needs the injection of critical investment in different projects, instead of loans that add to its debt burden, to rejuvenate the faltering economy.
Addressing members of the cabinet at a meeting last week, the premier appreciated the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), observing that the forum was playing an effective role in enabling Pakistan to realise its growth potential, especially by facilitating foreign investment into the country.
He shared with the cabinet that he had told friendly countries that Pakistan required investment this time around, but not loans. The PM emphasised that youth potential needed to be optimally harnessed through providing world-class training in income-generating skills.
He also called for promoting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by inculcating a culture of entrepreneurship, incentivising self-employment and supporting start-ups.
Pakistan is currently looking towards the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait along with other nations to stimulate investment in mining, agriculture, industry and energy sectors.
The prime minister said that by electing the present government, the people of Pakistan had reposed trust in its leadership and had high hopes that the government would provide them relief as well as put the economy on a sustainable and long-term development path.
He called the new cabinet a balanced combination of youth and experience, which was well placed to cope with the multidimensional challenges and serve the nation.
Read Tax policies to support investment sought
He recalled that the previous government led by him had also served people with great commitment and its biggest achievement was to protect Pakistan from the looming threat of default, which had been the real danger at the time he stepped into office.
Roadmap for economic revival
At the meeting, PM Shehbaz laid down the roadmap of his government for improving the quality of life of Pakistan’s people.
Taking stock of the problems afflicting the national economy, he shared his deep concern over the challenges, especially the rising circular debt in electricity and gas sectors as well as energy theft and losses amounting to trillions of rupees.
It was added that state-owned power generation companies (Gencos) with low performing plants were a huge liability for the government and vested interests were pilfering state resources at the cost of the nation.
The meeting chairman also voiced concern over the performance of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and its rapidly accruing liabilities, which exceeded Rs800 billion.
The PM asserted that low revenue collection driven by massive corruption in entities like the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and provision of subsidies to the elite rather than the poor were the key issues that would get immediate attention of the government.
He stated that Pakistan was being adversely affected by climate change as the recent flooding caused by heavy rains in Balochistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Jammu and Kashmir was one of its serious outcomes, which not only caused loss of life and property but also required significant financial resources for immediate relief and rehabilitation efforts.
Deep surgery
PM Shehbaz stressed that a “deep surgery” and structural reforms were required to pull the country out of the economic crisis and bring pro-poor changes to the system.
“We must either perform or perish, as we are in a now or never situation,” he remarked, adding that he and his government were determined to eliminate the vested interests that were obstructing Pakistan’s development.
The premier emphasised that his government would never be deterred by the enormity of the challenges that lay ahead in Pakistan’s path towards progress and development, and all allied parties would play their role to steer the country out of the current troubles, which was a difficult, but certainly not an impossible, task.

1,FDI recovers to $131 million in Feb,Marks 16% improvement from $113 million in February 2023,"Foreign investment in various sectors of the economy, including energy, telecom, and financial sectors, amounted to $131 million in February, reaching a cumulative $821 million in the first eight months of the current fiscal year 2023-24.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, foreign direct investment (FDI) had unexpectedly turned negative at $173 million in the previous month of January 2024.
This marked a 16% improvement from $113 million in February 2023.
The fresh inflow of external investment remains significantly low compared to the country’s true potential. However, the return of political and economic stability has provided the authorities with the opportunity to address flaws in the investment landscape and enable foreign investors to embark on new projects in Pakistan.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, M Abdul Aleem, Secretary General of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI), highlighted that the volume of FDI inflows has remained significantly lower than 1% of GDP.
“Pakistan has the potential to attract FDIs of at least 3% of GDP considering its growing population and economy,” he reiterated.
Aleem noted that the latest FDI inflows suggest foreign investors have mainly allocated funds to sustain existing projects rather than initiating new ones. He pointed out that the cumulative inflows of $821 million over eight months could be invested by a single investor in a single project if provided with a conducive environment.
He stressed that Pakistan has achieved political and economic stability after a prolonged period, with the rupee-dollar exchange rate remaining stable for several months. “This is an opportune time for policymakers and authorities to collaborate with local and foreign investors and foster an investment-friendly culture in the country.”
“Consistency in policies is key to attracting foreign investment, as abrupt changes often render investment projects infeasible,” Aleem added.
He suggested that Pakistan should learn from China’s approach to foreign investment. China, the world’s second-largest economy, responded to a slowdown in FDI inflows by formulating a new strategy to attract more foreign investment.
Read PM directs steps to attract FDI
Aleem recalled a recent policy statement by the new finance minister, Muhammad Aurangzeb, expressing the government’s desire to attract new FDIs in the export sector to reduce reliance on foreign loans and achieve sustainable economic growth in the medium to long term.
He urged authorities to proactively promote projects in the export sector to foreign investors, stating that a wait-and-see approach is no longer effective.
According to central bank data, FDIs in the first eight months decreased by 17% to $821 million compared to $990 million in the same period last year.
During this period, Hong Kong emerged as the largest foreign investor in Pakistan, investing $235 million, followed by the United Kingdom with $164 million.
China’s net investment of $80 million in the eight months slipped to the third position among top investors in FY24, down from $472 million in the same period last year (FY23).
The power sector attracted the largest investment of $249 million in the eight months of FY24, followed by the oil and gas exploration sector with $151 million. The financial sector received $125 million, while the petroleum refining sector secured $59 million in FDI during the eight months.
IT exports up 32%
Pakistan recorded monthly IT exports of $257 million, up 32% in February 2024 compared to the same month last year, according to Topline Research.
“The monthly IT exports in February 2024 exceed the last 12-month average of $233 million,” remarked Sunny Kumar, Head of Research at the firm.
The surge in IT exports is attributed to the relaxation of the permissible retention limit by the SBP, which increased it from 35% to 50% in Exporters’ Specialised Foreign Currency Accounts, along with a stable Pakistani currency, encouraging IT companies to repatriate their foreign income and deposit it in local accounts.
However, exports declined by 3% in February 2024 compared to the previous month of January. “The decline is attributed to fewer working days, with 19 days in February 2024 compared to 23 in January 2024.”
In the first eight months of FY24, IT exports reached $2 billion, up 15% compared to $1.7 billion recorded in the same period last year.
In a recent interview with a private TV channel, the newly appointed Finance Minister, Muhammad Aurangzeb, expressed optimism that IT exports are likely to reach $3.5 billion this year.
Shortly after the Sharif-led government took office, the prime minister convened a meeting focused on fully utilising the country’s potential for IT exports, directing the ministry to submit a comprehensive roadmap to boost IT exports.

2,Industrialists push for govt action on energy,"Concerns rise over IMF SLA, uninterrupted power supply, high power tariffs as industry faces shutdowns","In response to the key objectives outlined in the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Staff-Level Agreement (SLA), Karachi’s industrialists have urged the newly-elected government to adopt a fully-fledged strategy for reducing energy costs to revitalise the struggling industry. They also call for the formulation of better economic policies and comprehensive reforms.
Expressing concerns about the IMF-SLA objectives mentioned in the press release, particularly those related to energy, they fear that enforcing these policies without addressing critical infrastructure deficiencies could lead to the shutdown of companies across the country. With both small and large industries facing closures, urgent initiatives are needed to prevent further economic decline. There is significant unrest and anxiety due to the skyrocketing wave of street crimes fuelled by runaway inflation and unemployment in Karachi, the country’s port city.
Industrialists debate whether electricity should be provided to them at the Regionally Competitive Energy Tariff (RCET) or if they should be allowed to economically operate captive power plants, as the government is currently unable to meet the industry’s needs in terms of quality and quantity. While the IMF has consistently stressed the need to recover energy costs, this is the first time they have urged the government to focus on cost-effectiveness. Reducing the cost of energy to international levels would benefit local industrialists, they argue.
They criticised the government’s failure to provide uninterrupted power supply to the industry and highlighted the challenges faced by industrialists in operating captive power plants due to unaffordable gas and electricity tariffs. Despite previous support for RCET, the government withdrew it in March 2023 under IMF pressure, prompting industries to produce electricity using gas. However, subsequent increases in gas tariffs (to around over 220%) have further burdened industrialists, forcing many to switch to the power grid, where electricity costs continue to rise.
The exact electricity tariff billed to industries in the industrial zone is Rs55.74 per unit for February. Additionally, in one Site Association of Industry (SAI), 50% of small units and 20% of large units have closed due to unaffordable gas and electricity tariffs, despite Karachi being home to a total of seven industrial zones.
“As an industrialist and economic analyst, I believe that the five-year plan is indispensable for setting the roadmap for national development; for the systematic allocation of scarce resources to national priorities and thereafter to be used as a measurement of the achievement of developmental goals against targets over the period. Instability is the order of the day, and instability is the killer of any kind of investment,” said eminent industrialist Riaz Uddin.
Landhi Association of Trade and Industry (LATI) President Siraj S Monnoo highlighted the dire economic challenges faced by various industries. He highlighted the significant hurdles posed by factors such as higher gas and electricity tariffs, gas availability issues, water shortages, governmental corruption, inflation, and inadequate infrastructure. He called for improvements in the reliability and modernisation of transmission and distribution infrastructure, while citing the double cost impact of electricity and challenges in transitioning from captive power to the electricity grid. He stressed the importance of strengthening governance and management within distribution companies and implementing effective anti-theft measures.

3,French watchdog fines Google €250m,"Says AI-powered chatbot trained on content from publishers, news agencies","France’s competition watchdog on Wednesday said it fined Alphabet’s Google 250 million euros ($271.73 million) for breaches linked to EU intellectual property rules in its relationship with media publishers, citing concerns about the company’s AI service.
The watchdog said Google’s AI-powered chatbot Bard – since rebranded under the name Gemini – was trained on content from publishers and news agencies, without notifying them.
Google has pledged not to contest the facts as part of settlement proceedings, the watchdog said, adding the company also proposed a series of remedy measures to certain shortcomings.
Google said it accepted the settlement “because it is time to move on”, adding “we want to focus on the larger goal of sustainable approaches to connecting people with quality content and on working constructively with French publishers.”
The company said the fine was disproportionate, and said the watchdog had not sufficiently taken into account its efforts “in an environment where it’s very hard to set a course because we can’t predict which way the wind will blow next.”
The fine is linked to a copyright dispute in France over online content in a case triggered by complaints from some of the country’s biggest news organisations, including Agence France Presse. The dispute appeared to be resolved in 2022 when the US tech giant dropped its appeal against an initial 500-million-euro fine issued at the end of a major investigation carried out by the Autorite de la Concurrence. But in Wednesday’s statement, the watchdog said Google violated the terms of four out of seven commitments agreed in the settlement, including conducting negotiations with publishers in good faith and providing transparent information.
The watchdog in particular cited Google’s AI chatbot Bard, launched in 2023, which it said was trained on data from unspecified media outlets and news agencies without the company informing them or the regulator.

4,Govt pushes for climate financing at UN,"Without funding, developing countries won’t be able to achieve set targets, says envoy","Pakistan has underscored the critical importance of accelerating progress towards sustainable energy goals at a meeting of a United Nations-based panel on the subject.
In his closing remarks at the meeting of ‘Group of Friends for Sustainable Energy,’ Ambassador Munir Akram also said that concessional climate financing was critical for developing countries’ transition away from fossil fuels.
“Without concessional finance, developing countries would not be able to achieve the targets that have been set,” the Pakistani envoy said. “Energy lies at the heart of both the 2030 Agenda and our climate goals,” he added.
Stressing the central role of energy in both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and global climate objectives, Akram emphasised the pressing need for a just, orderly, and equitable energy transition.

Noting the scale of the challenge ahead, the Pakistani envoy said an additional 1000 GW of renewable power annually was needed to meet the 1.5-degree Celsius temperature target.
He stressed the importance of promoting cleaner power generation solutions, enhancing energy efficiency, and transforming energy infrastructure across sectors.
With the current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) falling short of necessary emissions reductions, he said the transition to sustainable energy requires substantial financing, pointing to the ‘staggering’ investment needs, including an estimated $150 trillion in transition technologies and infrastructure by 2050. He underscored the need to address barriers to accessing private finance, particularly in developing countries where capacity, regulatory frameworks, and investment certainty remain as challenges.
Proposing a comprehensive solution, Akram outlined a public-private entity under the auspices of the United Nations to coordinate sustainable infrastructure investment. This entity would convene stakeholders, formulate comprehensive plans, promote internationally accepted frameworks, and assist in project identification and preparation.
Re-affirming Pakistan’s commitment to advancing this proposal, he called for support from the international community.
In this context, he announced plans for further elaboration through a second meeting of the Group of Friends of Sustainable Infrastructure Investment, co-chaired by Pakistan and South Africa.
In conclusion, the ambassador called on collective action to scale up investment in sustainable infrastructure and drive the global energy transition forward.

5,Rupee rises to new five-month peak,Currency gains value in backdrop of IMF staff-level agreement,"Pakistani currency on Wednesday hit a new five-month high at Rs278.41 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market, maintaining its winning streak for the sixth successive working day in the backdrop of a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that would clear the way for the release of last tranche of $1.1 billion.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the rupee gained 0.07%, or Rs0.22, against the greenback on a day-on-day basis.
With the fresh appreciation, the currency has cumulatively surged 10.30%, or Rs28.69, in the past five and a half months compared to the all-time low of Rs307.10/$ recorded in the first week of September 2023.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) reported that the rupee rose Rs0.03 in the open market and closed at Rs281.12/$.
The fresh gains came after Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF at the completion of the last review under a $3 billion standby arrangement ending in March-April 2024.
The agreement suggests that the country has met all the pre-requisites under the loan programme and qualified for the last tranche of $1.1 billion. The IMF executive board is likely to give its final approval for the release of the tranche in late April.
Read With fresh gains, rupee at 5-1/2-month high
The inflow of over $1 billion will keep the rupee strong and help improve the country’s foreign exchange reserves, taking them to nearly $9 billion compared to the current level of $7.9 billion.
In addition, the investment of $141 million made by overseas Pakistanis through the Roshan Digital Account (RDA), improvement in foreign direct investment (FDI) that reached $131 million and increase in technology exports; all indicated that US dollars remained well supplied compared to their demand in the banking system.
REER up
Pakistan’s Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) – the value of Pakistani currency against a basket of currencies of its trading partners – further appreciated to 102.20 on the index in February compared to 101.70 in January.
The increasing REER suggests that the local currency stands at a fair-to-strong level. Further appreciation of the rupee may make imports cheaper and exports expensive.
The central bank, however, said on Monday it did not target REER for guiding the rupee’s direction.
Earlier during 2020 and 2023, the bank apparently maintained REER in the range of 95-96. Many central banks gauge their currency values on the global REER matrix to adjust them accordingly.

6,LNG prices raised up to 2.6% for March,SNGPL price has been raised by 2.58% per mmBtu on a month-on-month basis for the end-consumers on its network,"The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority on Wednesday increased the tariff on imported liquefied natural gas up to 2.6% per million British thermal units for the two public gas utilities, namely Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited and Sui Southern Gas Company with retrospective effect from March 1, 2024.
In a statement, the regulator said that the increase in monthly re-gasified LNG rates was due to the rise in its cost of supply. Ogra has notified both transmission and distribution prices for the two gas companies. The SNGPL price has been raised by 2.58% per mmBtu on a month-on-month basis for the end-consumers on its network. Ogra has fixed the price at $12.8142 per mmBtu for supplies in March. The price was marginally higher by $0.3220 per mmBtu from February 2024, when the rate was $12.4922.
Similarly, the RLNG price for SSGC has been raised by 0.76% per mmBtu. Now, end-consumers will pay $13.0563 per mmBtu for March, higher by $0.0979 than the price of $12.9584 per mmBtu in the previous month.

7,CPEC brings opportunities to Balochistan: PCJCCI,"Regional collaboration, infrastructure focus key to economic development","In a press statement released on Wednesday, Moazzam Ghurki, President of the Pakistan China Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCJCCI), highlighted the significant opportunities that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will bring to Balochistan. Ghurki emphasised that regional countries, especially Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, will utilise the corridor for exports and trade through the Gwadar port.
Quoting PCJCCI Senior Vice President Fang Yulong, the statement emphasized the immense potential of Balochistan’s minerals and fishery sectors. Yulong noted that the federal government is taking serious steps to harness this potential for the benefit of the people of Pakistan. He stressed that Gwadar port and various projects under CPEC will bring significant changes to Balochistan. 
Read IMF assured: No more funds for CPEC
The government is particularly focusing on road infrastructure, industrial and agricultural development, employment generation, and provision of basic facilities in the region. Yulong further stressed the need for investments in transportation, infrastructure construction, clean drinking water, agriculture, livestock, information technology, energy, industry, commerce, manpower, and education for the revolutionary development of the neglected province.
PCJCCI Vice President Hamza Khalid stated that the new government is committed to the social and economic uplift of Balochistan to bring it at par with other provinces. He mentioned that Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and China have agreed to allocate dedicated spaces in Gwadar and Tashkent for establishing warehouses to facilitate transportation of goods within the region.
PCJCCI Secretary General Salahuddin Hanif stated that CPEC presents new avenues of opportunities for Balochistan. He highlighted the province’s pivotal role in CPEC due to Gwadar’s central position in the project. Hanif expressed optimism that CPEC will contribute to the overall development of Balochistan and address its economic and social challenges.

8,"Bulls extend rally, fuelled by IMF deal","KSE-100 index rises 229.20 points, settles at 65,731.79","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday extended its bull-run for the third successive day as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Islamabad reached a staff-level agreement following the final review under a $3 billion standby arrangement.
Earlier, trading kicked off with optimism that the staff-level agreement would pave the way for the release of last loan tranche of $1.1 billion in March or April.
Pakistan’s economic and financial positions have improved, said the IMF staff in a statement, which encouraged bulls to build their positions, taking the KSE-100 index to the intra-day high of 65,968.02.
Additionally, Pakistan’s current account surplus reached an impressive $128 million in February, which reduced pressure on the country’s external account and also aided the momentum at the bourse.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the current account balance was in deficit at $303 million in the prior month of January while the deficit stood at $50 million a year ago in February 2023.
Banking and fertiliser sectors continued to notch up significant gains at the bourse, which managed to maintain its upward trajectory for most of the day. However, the index took a dive in the second half and hit the intra-day low at 65,614.94 points.
The market failed to cross the 66,000 mark but closed the day in the green with moderate gains.
“Stocks closed higher after Pakistan and the IMF reached a staff-level agreement, strong data showing a $128 million current account surplus in February and Roshan Digital Account (RDA) deposits reaching $7.4 billion, which supported the rupee recovery,” said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.
Read PSX bounces back on SBP, IMF optimism
“A rally in dollar bonds that advanced to two-year highs on initial approval of a $1.1 billion IMF payout played the role of catalyst in bullish close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 229.20 points, or 0.35%, and settled at 65,731.79.
Topline Securities reported that the KSE-100 index remained positive throughout the day.
Fertiliser and banking sectors contributed positively as Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, Packages Limited and Engro Corporation added 151 points to the index, it said.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, commented that “another approach and knockback from 66,000 will make the eventual breach more powerful”.
The IMF gave its initial approval for the last $1.1 billion tranche of the current programme, which would ensure debt servicing through June, it said.
Pakistan International Airlines and Pakistan Telecommunication Company again gained the maximum value for the day.
“The outlook remains positive with the clock ticking on 66,000 containing the price action,” the AHL report added.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that bullish momentum persisted, largely driven by news of a staff-level agreement with the IMF during market hours.
“Looking forward, we suggest investors to consider adopting a buy-on-dips strategy, particularly focusing on banking, exploration and production, and technology sectors,” the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 341.8 million shares against Tuesday’s tally of 323.3 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs11.8 billion.
Shares of 342 companies were traded. Of these, 173 stocks closed higher, 146 dropped and 23 remained unchanged.
The Bank of Punjab was the volume leader with trading in 45.01 million shares, gaining Rs0.14 to close at Rs5.28. It was followed by WorldCall Telecom with 34.4 million shares, losing Rs0.02 to close at Rs1.36 and The Organic Meat Company with 17.99 million shares, losing Rs0.57 to close at Rs28.97.
Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth Rs26.04 million, according to the NCCPL.

9,Tax policies to support investment sought,"Tax bar chief says Pakistan can learn from China’s tax reforms, dispute resolution","Lahore Tax Bar Association (LTBA) newly elected President Shahbaz Siddique has pledged to implement a series of initiatives aimed at promoting strong and mutually beneficial cooperation between Pakistan and China in the field of taxation.
Recognising the importance of collaboration between the two countries, he aims to leverage this partnership to drive economic growth and development.
With the acceleration of the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), there is a growing need for effective tax policies and regulations that support these investments.
In a recent interview with China Economic Net, Shahbaz highlighted the significance of a robust tax framework to ensure transparency, fairness and ease of doing business for both Pakistani and Chinese companies.
He noted that the collaboration between Pakistan and China in taxation holds great potential, including exchange of expertise, investment and trade, avoidance of double taxation and digital taxation.

The two countries regularly engage in bilateral discussions and agreements to enhance economic cooperation, which may include tax matters. He said that Pakistan can learn from China’s experiences in tax reform, administration and dispute resolution.
LTBA plays a crucial role in promoting tax laws in Pakistan by facilitating communication among tax professionals, organising educational seminars and advocating effective tax policies that benefit both taxpayers and the government.
The association president is committed to addressing the current taxation challenges faced by Pakistan in working with China such as different tax systems, language and cultural barriers, legal and regulatory harmonisation.
One of the key initiatives that Shahbaz plans to undertake is to establish a dedicated online platform for knowledge sharing and exchange among tax professionals from both countries.
The platform will serve as a hub for sharing best practices, discussing challenges and exploring opportunities for collaboration on tax matters.
Furthermore, the association intends to organise bilateral tax conferences, exchange programmes, joint research and publications, training and capacity building, policy advocacy, etc.
These events will provide valuable opportunities for participants to deepen their understanding of each other’s tax systems and foster meaningful connections.
