1,"Lu lied in cypher case testimony, claims PTI",Party demands ‘open trial’ of diplomatic cable case," 
PTI leaders on Thursday claimed that US Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu -- who a day earlier in his testimony in connection with the cipher controversy declared the allegations of party’s founding chairman Imran Khan that the Americans were behind his ouster in 2022 as a “complete falsehood” – was lying on the matter, demanding an open trial of the case.
Speaking to the media outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail where Imran is currently incarcerated, PTI stalwart Gohar Ali Khan maintained that what Lu had testified before a subcommittee of the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs was a lie and demanded another inquiry into the matter.
The PTI leader said former Pakistani envoy to the US Asad Majeed -- the man at centre of the entire cipher controversy -- had admitted that he met with Lu as well as conceded that there was indeed a diplomatic cable.
He added that it was on Majeed’s request that a demarche was also handed over to the then acting US envoy.
The secret memo allegedly contained minutes of the meeting between the former Pakistani envoy and Lu wherein the latter had conveyed a “threatening” message that if the vote of no-confidence against Imran did not succeed, the country would have to face the consequences.
In his testimony, Lu said the then-ambassador of Pakistan to the US had told his government that there was no conspiracy.
During a lengthy hearing, Gohar highlighted that Lu spent merely a fraction of the time addressing the cipher issue, while diverting the conversation to other matters.
About the general elections on February 8, the PTI leader underscored Lu's assertion during the hearing that the US had never endorsed the polls in the country as “free and fair”.
Gohar further said he had held a meeting with Imran in jail earlier in the day and discussed the issue.
“Asad Majeed should issue his own statement on Donald Lu’s testimony yesterday,” he added.
The PTI leader noted that Lu had denied the content of the cipher and even the meeting with Majeed.
However, he continued that Majeed had submitted the content of the cipher to the court and confirmed that his meeting with Lu did take place.
Gohar said Imran’s sister Aleema Khan had also pushed for filing a case against Lu in the US but it was their family’s decision.

“We have complete confidence in our own courts,” he added.
The PTI leader further said Imran had predicted that current coalition government would not last for more than five months.
He continued that if Imran was released from jail, it would not be an outcome of any deal.
In a related development, PTI Secretary Information Raoof Hasan while addressing a news conference at the party’s central secretariat in Islamabad said Lu’s testimony had proven that the cipher did really exist despite his refusal to acknowledge its content and Imran had not lied about it.
He further said initially, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) had denied its existence, but later acknowledged the violations of the Official Secret Act by initiating the cipher case even though the cabinet had declassified the document.
Hasan referred to the two National Security Committee (NSC) meetings convened to discuss the cipher, during which it was decided to issue a formal demarche to the US government in Islamabad and Washington.
“We have the minutes of the NSC meeting. Its participants conceded that there was evidence of significant interference in Pakistan's internal affairs.”
Hasan also pointed out that the content of the cipher was no longer confidential, having been published in the international press.
Speaking on the occasion, PTI leader and former Gilgit-Baltistan chief minister Khalid Khurshid highlighted the disparity between Pakistan's prohibition on discussing the cipher issue and the open US congressional hearing on the matter.
Calling for an open trial of the cipher case in Pakistan, Khurshid emphasised the need to investigate the circumstances under which a foreign diplomat purportedly threatened the country of grave consequences if its elected prime minister was not removed.
He expressed confidence in the judiciary's ability to deliver justice, maintaining that Imran was innocent despite his incarceration.

2,FO rejects US poll rigging concerns,Islamabad labels Congressional remarks ‘misunderstanding’,"The Foreign Office on Thursday termed the concerns raised during a US Congressional hearing regarding alleged irregularities in the Feb 8 general elections a “misunderstanding of Pakistan's domestic situation and electoral laws”.
“It was an internal debate between the US Congress and the Biden administration. As we said last week, Pakistan values its close relationship with the United States and believes in constructive engagement,” FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said during her weekly briefing.
“We believe that the deliberations of legislative bodies should contribute to promoting positive dynamics in bilateral ties and should be based on mutual respect and understanding,” she added.
A day earlier, US Assistant Secretary of State for Central and South Asia Donald Lu informed the US Congressional panel that if the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) failed to investigate the claims of irregularities in the Feb 8 elections, it would “retard” America’s relationship with Pakistan.
“It will retard our ability to have the type of relationship we want, in security matters, on [the] business front and people to people. All that suffers if Pakistan is not a full democracy,” the diplomat said.
“We have never used the term ‘free and fair’ in characterising these elections,” Lu said while responding to a question from Congressman August Pfluger, a Texas Republican.
Responding to the testimony of Lu before the congressional committee, the FO spokesperson said Pakistan had taken note of the proceedings.
However, she noted during the hearing, some statements were made, which were “intrusive” and “reflected a misunderstanding of Pakistan's domestic situation and electoral laws”.
“We hope to engage in meaningful discussions with the United States to address these misunderstandings. We also hope that the US Congress will play a positive and constructive role in strengthening Pakistan-US ties and developing avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation,” she said.
On the relations with Afghanistan, the FO spokesperson said, channels of communication with Afghanistan remained open and Islamabad was looking forward to working with the de facto government in Kabul to find a solution to the problem.
Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan reached new heights earlier this week when Pakistan struck inside Afghanistan on March 18. The rare cross border strikes that hit several terrorist hideouts in Khost and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan was in retaliation to the March 16 terrorist attack in Mir Ali, North Waziristan that left seven Pakistani soldiers martyred.
The Afghan Taliban condemned the strikes as violation of its sovereignty and disputed Pakistani claims that those strikes killed terrorists. But the FO spokesperson at the weekly briefing without providing specific details insisted that the operation was aimed at terrorist hideouts and not the Afghan government or civilians.
“The 18th of March operation was not targeted against the government or institutions or the people of Afghanistan. It was a targeted operation against terrorist hideouts and sanctuaries,” Mumtaz Zahra Baloch told reporters here.

“Our position has always been to resolve issues through dialogue. Pakistan has said, including in our statement of the 18th of March, that we respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan and look forward to working together to find joint solutions in countering terrorism and preventing any terrorist entity from sabotaging bilateral relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” she added.
The spokesperson said even prior to the cross border strikes, Pakistan was in touch with the Afghan authorities. She said the Afghan envoy in Islamabad was summoned to record a strong protest after the March 16 Mir Ali attack.
“Yes, after the 16th of March terrorist attack in Pakistan, there was communication between the two countries and a demarche was made with the Afghan authorities conveying our serious concern about the involvement of terrorists from the Gul Bahadur group, which was the prime target of our operation of the 18th of March.”
“The same concern was also conveyed by our Foreign Minister in his telephone conversation with the Interim Afghan Foreign Minister,” she said whilel referring to the maiden telephone contact between Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Afghan counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi.
To a question, the spokesperson said both sides were still in contact with each other despite recent tensions.
“And yes, the channels of communication between the two countries remain open and our respective embassies are the main channel of communication between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” she maintained.
When asked, the spokesperson said she would not like to delve into operational details.
“We would only like to focus on what we have already shared, that this operation that Pakistan undertook was an intelligence-based operation and it was a targeted operation against terrorists belonging to TTP and the Gul Bahadur group,” she stressed.
“We would not like to glorify any terrorists and list their names. However, as I have said earlier, our focus was the hideout and sanctuaries of the Gul Bahadur group,” she further said.
The spokesperson contested the Afghan government's claims that there were no terrorist hideouts inside Afghanistan. She said Pakistan had on a number of occasions shared its concerns with the Afghan authorities about the presence of terrorist hideouts. The same was endorsed by a UN report, she added.

3,Attending political rally not crime: SC,Apex court grants bail to five people booked for May 9 acts of vandalism,"Granting post-arrest bail to five people accused of committing acts of vandalism in the wake of May 9, 2023 arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan, the Supreme Court has noted that it is not a crime to participate in a political rally.
A three-member bench led by Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and comprising Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Mussarat Hilali on Wednesday took up bail applications of the accused nominated under various laws including the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997 for vandalizing Hamza Camp in Rawalpindi.
During the proceedings, Justice Mandokhail asked authorities as to whether they were aware of the circumstances under which charges of terrorism could be added to a first information report (FIR).
“Recently, an incident of terrorism occurred in which officers were martyred [in North Waziristan]. The attack on Peshawar’s Army Public School was an act of terror. The suicide attack on lawyers in Quetta [some years back] was an act of terror.
Taking exception to booking the accused under the ATA, 1997, the judge said: “Play your political game in the political arena. Don't fight political battles in the courts. The relevant section [of the ATA. 1997] cannot be applied unless firearms are involved.""
Justice Rizvi noted that the offense of obstructing a government officer in the discharge of his duties has also been applied, the punishment for which is two years.
He said: “All witnesses are police officers, there is no independent witness. The testimonies of police officers are of general nature; there is no video evidence.""
Justice Hilali remarked that police officers can also be witnesses, but they must present evidence.
When the accused's lawyer stated that the suspects have no affiliation with any political party, Justice Mandokhail asked if it is a crime to have an affiliation with a political party. “We imposed restrictions on political parties and student unions, which is why we have reached this point.""
He said the state is like parents. When parents get angry, they forgive their children after slapping them once or twice. “What will be achieved by shutting everyone down? Besides, a year has already passed [since the arrest of the accused],” he said.
Justice Mandokhail asked the prosecution if the authorities were given a pre-existing list to nominate people after the rioting incidents.
When the investigating officer stated that the nominated accused had participated in the rally staged after the arrest of Imran Khan on May 9, Justice Mandokhail questioned if participating in a rally is a crime.
Justice Rizvi asked the prosecution why they included sections related to conspiracy in the FIR.
The investigating officer replied that a head constable from the Special Branch, stationed on duty at Jinnah Park in Lahore—the residence of PTI chief Imran Khan—had testified that conspiracy for May 9 incidents was hatched there.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail questioned, ""Should we believe the testimony of just one head constable that a former prime minister is a traitor?"" Justice Rizvi asked, ""Has the conspiracy of the recent check posts' bombings been uncovered?""
Justice Mandokhel noted that the court appreciates the sacrifices of law enforcement agencies. However, the system should be allowed to function.
The Supreme Court later granted bail to the suspects by accepting their bail requests in exchange for surety bonds of Rs50,000 each.
The court noted that the trial court should not be affected by the comments made during the bail proceedings. If individuals are not involved in any other crime, they should be released on bail, it said.
The FIR, filed at Rawalpindi's New Town Police Station, named suspects Owais, Nasrullah, Saifullah, Kamran, and Waqas in connection with the May 9 rioting incident.
