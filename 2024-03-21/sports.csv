1,Over 200 kidnappings reported in two months,Police data shows perilous law and order situation in rural Sindh,"A disturbing surge in street crimes, robberies, and kidnappings reveals a perilous decline in security measures as the deteriorating law and order does not seem to be a priority for the Sindh government.
Once confined to traditional methods like honey traps, bandits now operate with brazen impunity, targeting transporters and traders along the National Highway and Superhighway. Over 200 people, including businessmen, have fallen victim to kidnapping in Sindh within a mere two months, with over 50 being released only upon payment of ransom.
According to data from the Central Police Office, 81 abduction cases have been reported in the Sukkur and Larkana regions, with 59 abductees rescued through ransom or other means. However, 28 cases remain unregistered, highlighting a systemic failure in addressing the menace. Similarly, in Ghotki district, where 26 abductions occurred, only 22 victims have been rescued, with a concerning discrepancy between registered and unregistered cases. Shikarpur and Kashmore have witnessed similar trends, with 18 and 37 abductions respectively, further exacerbated by the lack of effective law enforcement.
Despite the PPP assuming power, a coherent strategy to combat criminal elements, particularly in rural Sindh, remains elusive as  the escalation of kidnapping cases in Kashmore, Shikarpur, Ghotki, and Sukkur persists unabated, casting doubt on the government's commitment to ensuring the safety and security of its citizens.

5,Woman drags neighbour to court over early rising rooster,Urges SHC to invoke public nuisance law,"A rooster announcing the dawn of the new day with its eternal cock-a-doodle-do call has become a ‘public nuisance’ in a tranquil upscale neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
A woman has dragged her neighbours to court over an allegation that their rooster and chicken were disturbing the peace of the locality and were thus a public nuisance.
The Sindh High Court Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi heard the woman's plea against raising chicken at home. The complainant stated that besides the hackling hens, the early rising rooster was headache for the whole locality.
A two-member bench headed by Chief Justice Sindh remarked whether a complaint was made to the concerned institutions in this regard.
The petitioner said that the Cantonment Board Clifton is doing nothing about it. She said that the CBC officials said that there was no law against keeping chicken at home. Though she contended that there was noise in the whole area due to the chickens in the said house, the CBC officials said people keep parrots and pigeons
Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi remarked that chickens are very mischievous and make a lot of noise. The petitioner said that there is a public nuisance law which is being violated.
Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi said in his remarks that what should people do who keep chicken at home, should we ask them to slaughter all of their chicken. He recalled that in the olden days, naughty boys used to kidnap, slaughter and devour neighbourhood chicken.
The court adjourned the hearing till April 23 while asking the relevant institutions to respond on the next hearing.
