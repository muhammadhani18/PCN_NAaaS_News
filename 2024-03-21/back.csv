0,President claims immunity in Park Lane reference,NAB prosecutor says essential to first determine whether court can hear case as per existing laws,"President Asif Ali Zardari's legal counsel told an accountability court on Tuesday that his client, who was recently elected to the post, was entitled to presidential immunity.
Farooq H. Naik argued that the immunity shields President Zardari from further proceedings in the Park Lane reference case.
Accountability court Judge Nasir Javed Rana presided over the proceedings and heard the Park Lane reference against President Zardari and others. Farooq H. Naik represented President Zardari during the session.
Naik emphasised that President Zardari's status as the country's elected head granted him immunity from legal action, thus rendering the continuation of the case against him untenable.

In response to Naik's argument, the court questioned whether the case proceedings would proceed against the other accused individuals. Naik clarified that legal action could indeed be pursued against them.
The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor contended that this case pertains to a private bank. It will first need to be determined whether this court can even hear it, as per the existing laws.
He further said deputy prosecutor Azhar Maqbool Shah has presented arguments concerning other references, adding that he will also argue this reference at the next hearing.
Subsequently, the court adjourned the hearing until April 17.
In the mega money laundering charges, the former president, his sister and several of their business associates were being probed as part of a 2015 case involving fake accounts and fictitious transactions.
The main reference in the Park Lane case accused Zardari of influencing relevant authorities during his tenure as the president – from 2008 to 2013 – to obtain loans for his front companies.
Zardari allegedly received a loan of Rs1.5 billion released for Parthenon Private Limited “with ill intention”, and the money was later transferred for his personal use through fake bank accounts. NAB accused him of causing the national exchequer a loss of Rs3.77 billion.
The anti-graft body later filed a supplementary reference against Zardari in the Park Lane case, accusing him of using fake documents to acquire a bank loan for a dummy corporation.

1,Zardari pursues court for presidential immunity,Accountability court issues notice to anti-graft buster,"President Asif Ali Zardari filed on Thursday an application in an accountability court in Islamabad seeking presidential immunity in the Thatta Water Supply reference.
The case was heard by judge Nasir Javed Rana.
During the hearing, Zardari’s counsel maintained that his client enjoyed presidential immunity, therefore, proceedings against him could not be carried out.
The court while issuing notice to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) sought arguments, and adjourned the hearing of the case until April 22.

The other accused in the case include former secretary Ejaz Ahmed Khan, Ali Akbar, Ejaz Memon, Ali Akbar Abro, Khawaja Abdul Ghani Majeed, Manahal Majeed, Abdul Nadeem Bhutto and others.
The water supply reference pertains to an alleged illegal award of a contract for the water supply scheme in Thatta to a private contractor.
In January 2023, an accountability court returned a corruption reference against Zardari after amendments to the NAB law. Earlier, he had also secured presidential immunity in the Park Lane reference case.
The Park Lane case accused Zardari of influencing relevant authorities during his tenure as the president – from 2008 to 2013 – to obtain loans for his front companies.
Zardari allegedly received a loan of Rs1.5 billion released for Parthenon Private Limited “with ill intention”, and the money was later transferred for his personal use through fake bank accounts.
The anti-graft buster accused him of causing a loss of Rs3.77 billion to the national exchequer.

2,We don’t want armed conflict with Afghanistan: Asif,Defence minister says message needed to be sent that cross-border terrorism has become intolerable,"Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Thursday that Pakistan did not want any armed conflict with Afghanistan, but warned Kabul that Islamabad could block the corridor for its trade with India if it failed to curb anti-Pakistan terrorists operating from there.
In an interview with Voice of America (VoA), Asif highlighted a surge in terror attacks in Pakistan since the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021. He recalled that during a visit to Kabul last year he had advised Taliban not to let past “favours” from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) tie their hands.
“Force is the last resort. We do not want to have an armed conflict with Afghanistan,” Asif said, while speaking about the airstrikes on alleged terrorist hideouts across the border. He noted that a message needed to be sent that cross-border terrorism had become intolerable.
Pakistan carried out strikes inside the neighbouring country in response to a March 16 terrorist attack in Mir Ali, North Waziristan, in which seven Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, were martyred. the target of the operation was the terrorists, responsible for multiple terrorist attacks in Pakistan.

The minister stressed that Pakistan needed to convey to the rulers in Kabul that the current situation was untenable. “If they [TTP] can harm us, then we’ll be forced to [retaliate],” Asif said.
However, he hoped Afghanistan would rein in the TTP, preventing the need for future military strikes from Pakistan.
Asif questioned the rationale behind providing trade corridor if Afghanistan treated Pakistan as an enemy. He cautioned that Pakistan could block this corridor it provides to Afghanistan for trade with India if Kabul failed to curb anti-Pakistan terrorists on its soil.
Responding to a question, Asif said that Kabul was allowing the TTP to operate against Pakistan to prevent its members from joining the Islamic State’s (IS) local chapter, known as IS-Khorasan.
He referred to IS-KP as a major internal security threat for Afghanistan.
Despite China’s silence on the cross-border fighting, Asif dismissed the notion of lack of public support from Beijing. “It’s not necessary that the world must applaud us.
What is in our interest is enough for us. We are protecting our interest, irrespective of whether someone applauds us or not.”

3,SC emphasizes fair nomination scrutiny,Top court says ROs have no right to determine ‘office hours’," 
The Supreme Court has noted that returning officers (ROs) must scrutinise all the nomination papers submitted to them in the best interest of justice and to uphold the fundamental right of any individual to contest elections
""Returning officers must remember that it is a fundamental right of an individual to contest elections … if they sabotage an individual not only do they rob [them] of their fundamental right but they also rob the populace at large of voting for that [them], which is also a fundamental right protected by the Constitution,” read an 11-page detailed judgment authored by Justice Irfan Saadat Khan on the acceptance of the nomination papers of a candidate, Shaukat Mahmood.
A three-judge bench, led by Justice Munib Akhtar, heard the matter. The detailed judgment observed that ROs were an integral part of the electoral process and it was highly unbecoming of any of them to exercise the authority conferred upon them in a manner which sabotaged the electoral process.
""We have carefully perused the one-page notification multiple times, and in any of those instances have not come across any official ‘office hours’.
Read PTI decries ‘historic electoral heist’
With due respect to the returning officer, if the ECP [Election Commission of Pakistan] has fixed the last date for scrutiny of nomination papers as 30.12.2023, the returning officer has no right to determine the cut-off period on 30.12.2023 or what ‘office hours’ he or she will operate until on the last date, i.e. 30.12.2023.
In our view, until the clock strikes midnight on 30.12.2023 or whatever the last date of the scrutiny of nomination paper[s] may be for any future election, the returning officer must scrutinise all nomination papers submitted to him [or her] in the best interest of justice and to uphold the fundamental right of any individual to contest [the] elections.""
Justice Irfan Saadat also pointed out that elections were the bedrock of a democracy and the 16th president of the US, Abraham Lincoln, had once said the polls belonged to the people.
“Therefore, it is essential that those wishing to contest [the] elections be facilitated as far as is legally permissible.
It goes without saying that it is against democratic norms and principles to add technical bottlenecks in the way of any individual, who is a citizen of this country, trying contest [the] elections.
And in this backdrop, it is pertinent to say that electoral laws and rules cannot be used as an arbitrary filtering mechanism, dependent on the whims of a returning officer,” the verdict read. 
”Therefore, a returning officer should exercise the discretional powers available to [them] in a rational and meticulous manner.”

4,Pakistan demands UNSC overhaul,Urges world body to be more inclusive to address conflicts,"Pakistan has called on the UN Security Council to “seriously consider” ways to implement its resolutions, especially on long-standing disputes, while stressing that the 15-member body must become more transparent, accountable, inclusive and democratic to respond to the growing challenges.
“Nothing undermines the credibility of the Council more than the ‘selective’ implementation and non-implementation of its resolutions,’ Ambassador Munir Akram told delegates when the long-running negotiations aimed at restructuring the Security Council resumed Tuesday.
“Failure to enforce its resolutions undermines the credibility of the Security Council and erodes confidence in its ability to fulfil the responsibilities assigned by the UN Charter,” the Pakistani envoy said at a session devoted to the five interlinked ‘clusters’ of issues on reforming the Security Council, with a focused discussion on its working methods.
In his remarks, Ambassador Akram reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to promoting enhanced transparency, accountability, and inclusivity within the Security Council’s working methods, and called for collective efforts to achieve meaningful reforms.
Full-scale negotiations to reform the Security Council began in the General Assembly in February 2009 on five key clusters — the categories of membership, the question of veto, regional representation, size of an enlarged Security Council, and working methods of the council and its relationship with the General Assembly.
Despite a general agreement on enlarging the Council, as part of the UN reform process, member states remain divided over the details.
The so-called Group of Four — India, Brazil, Germany and Japan — who seek for themselves permanent seats on the Council have shown no flexibility in their push for expanding the Council by 10 seats, with six additional permanent and four non-permanent members.
On the other hand, the Italy/Pakistan-led Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group, which firmly opposes additional permanent members, has proposed a new category of members — not permanent members — with longer duration in terms and a possibility to get re-elected.
The Security Council is currently composed of five permanent members — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — and 10 non-permanent members elected to serve for two years.
Highlighting the integral role of working methods reform within the ongoing reform process, Ambassador Akram underscored the imperative for the Council to address its procedures to enhance functionality and inclusivity. He particularly emphasized the need for transparency, inclusivity, and democratic processes in decision-making.
Pointing out that UN Charter assigns distinct but complementary roles to both the Security Council and the General Assembly, Ambassador Akram said, ” We should all be seriously concerned at the continuing encroachment by the Security Council on the functions and powers of the General Assembly, in particular, by attempting to set legal norms and establish definitions for various issues that are squarely within the purview of the General Assembly.”

6,AJK ministers dismiss govt change rumours,Express confidence in Premier Haq’s leadership," 
Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) senior minister Waqar Ahmad Noor, along with five other ministers, has unequivocally dismissed any notion of a government change in the region.
Addressing a news conference in Muzaffarabad, Noor noted that disinformation and propaganda was being spread by certain elements with vested interests in this regard.
He was flanked by five other ministers from the three ruling parties, including Faisal Mumtaz Rathore, Sardar Javed Ayoob, Majid Khan, Ahmad Raza Qadri, Nisar Ansar Abdali and Akbar Ibrahim.
Noor reaffirmed the government’s resolve to fostering good governance and accountability across all sectors. He pointed out that those threatened by accountability had been spreading malicious propaganda to undermine the process.
He unequivocally stated that AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq was untainted and would boldly pursue the accountability process in the region.
He emphasised that all coalition parties remained steadfast in their support for the government under Haq's leadership throughout its tenure.
The minister stated that the premier would strictly adhere to the book and rules for the betterment of governance. He noted that those affected by the stringent adherence to rules were vocal in their opposition to the government, potentially aiming to destabilise it.
He affirmed that Haq had no vulnerabilities that would render him susceptible to blackmail by mafias.
Noor stated that funds had been redirected towards development schemes and social sectors such as health by reducing non-development expenditures under the prime minister's directives.
Minister for Inland Revenue Abdul Majid Khan, Minister for Local Government and Rural Development Faisal Mumtaz Rathore, and Minister for Health Ansar Abadali also spoke on the occasion, affirming their trust in PM Haq's leadership and dismissing any speculation regarding a government change in the region.

7,PTI issues ‘white paper’ on rigging,Document contains list of 40 polling stations where results were ‘altered’,"The PTI on Wednesday released a list of more than 40 polling stations across various National Assembly constituencies, alleging that the preliminary Form 45 results were manipulated there -- causing the reversal of victories for the party-backed candidates.
On social media platforms, the party shared a report titled ‘Whitepaper on Rigging’ which contained scanned copies of the “original” Form 45s alongside the allegedly tampered or forged versions.
“A thread highlighting the forgery committed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP),” the PTI wrote in the first of a series of posts on micro-blogging platform X.
“Let the world know that the biased and highly controversial Election Commission of Pakistan uploaded fabricated Forms 45 on its website, almost a month after General Elections 2024.""
A Form 45 contains crucial data from a polling station.
The PTI claimed that their nominated candidates possessed the original and signed Form 45s received on the polling day.
It condemned the “blatant and outrageous tampering, editing, and forgery” evident in the Form 45s issued by the ECP.
The PTI further accused the “#MandateThieves” of manipulating the election results to undermine party’s founding chairman Imran Khan's two-thirds majority mandate, and forming what they described as an “illegitimate” government of a “#CoalitionOfLosers”.
The party highlighted the need for the matter to undergo international scrutiny.
In specific instances, the PTI highlighted alleged irregularities in various constituencies.
For example at the polling station of NA-130 Pak Public Foundation Boys High School, PTI-backed candidate Yasmin Rashid initially secured 281 votes, while her opponent, three-time former premier Nawaz Sharif, obtained 180 votes.
However, subsequent examination revealed “discrepancies” as the tally for Yasmin was “reduced” to 179, while Nawaz’s count was inflated to 286 through “overwriting”.
The overall vote count remained unaltered, as indicated in the column displaying them.
The party also highlighted similar alleged irregularities in NA-130 where Nawaz’s vote count purportedly surged from 378 to 1,378, 313 to 1,313, and 235 to 1,235 at various other polling stations within the constituency.
Similarly in NA-57 Rawalpindi, PTI-backed Seemabia Tahir received 265 votes according to the “original” Form 45.
However, the party claimed that the ECP's website later displayed allegedly swapped vote counts, overturning Seemabia’s “victory”.
Similar alleged discrepancies were noted in NA-64 Gujrat, where PTI President Chaudhry Parvez Elahi's wife Qaisera Elahi saw her “victory” converted into “defeat” because of the alleged tampering of the vote count.
She secured 507 votes against PML-Q’s Chaudhry Salik Hussain, who managed to obtain only 31 votes at the 176 Social Welfare polling station.
However, a subsequent review revealed alleged tampering with the result posted on the ECP website displaying “overwriting”.
The PTI-backed candidate's vote count was “reduced” to 007, while that of Salik was “increased” to 531.
At another polling station, she garnered 339 votes but this tally was later diminished to 039.
In contrast, her opponent originally secured 440 votes at this polling station, but through “overwriting”, his count was “increased” to 615.
Furthermore, the PTI pointed out similar alleged irregularities in other constituencies including NA-71 Sialkot, where vote counts were allegedly manipulated in favour of opposing candidates.
Similar alleged discrepancies were observed in various other polling stations in many constituencies including NA-85, NA-98, NA-117, NA-126, NA-128, NA-148, NA-151, NA-219, NA-232, NA-238, and NA-263.
The PTI's claims raise significant concerns about the integrity of the electoral process, prompting calls for a thorough investigation and accountability measures.

8,"Naran avalanche buries hotels, houses",Incident sparks fears of significant financial losses amounting to tens of millions of rupees,"Several houses and hotels in the popular tourist resort of Naran, in the Mansehra District of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), were buried under avalanche, following the collapse of two glaciers, officials of the Kaghan Development Authority (KDA) said on Thursday.
Naran in the upper Kaghan Valley is one of the most popular tourist attractions locally as well as internationally. It is the most visited valley in Pakistan in the summer season.
The area becomes almost empty in winters because of severe cold, and road closures because of snowfall.
As usual, the road to Naran remains closed at several places due to avalanches.

According to the information received from Naran, the KDA officials said, several hotels and houses were buried under the avalanche because of the collapse of Ghamla and Chapran glaciers on Jheel Road in Naran.
They added that the government agencies faced difficulties in gathering verified data of the losses. “The Kaghan Development Authority held an emergency meeting and formed a team to assess the damage,” KDA Director General Muhammad Shabir Khan said.
Khan stressed that emergency team was being rushed to the affected town to immediately assess the damage and and submit its recommendations to the board. He added that work on Naran’s Jheel road, which had been closed by the avalanche, would be started when the access to the town was restored.
Khan said that KDA would help with the locals in all possible ways. He expressed concern that construction should be discouraged in places in the hit of the glaciers. “Guidance would sought from the local elders of Naran, who are well aware of these eventualities,” he added.

9,PIA plane grounded in Istanbul after technical fault,Boeing 777 scheduled to arrive from Turkiye malfunctioned on taxiway before taking off,"A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight returning from Turkiye on Wednesday was temporarily grounded in Istanbul because of a technical fault in its landing gear.
According to sources, the landing gear of PIA’s Boeing 777 scheduled to arrive from Turkiye to Pakistan suddenly malfunctioned on the taxiway before taking off.
The captain of flight PK-704 diverted the aircraft back to the boarding bridge as per the standard operating formulated for this situation.
Later, the passengers were offloaded and shifted to the airport’s lounge.
A team of engineers left from Karachi to Istanbul with spare parts for repair work.
The passengers have been sent to Pakistan by a Turkish Airlines flight.
Arrangements are under way to bring some stranded passengers to Islamabad through an alternative flight.
On Monday, another PIA’s Boeing 777, which made an emergency landing at Muscat International Airport, returned to the country after the replacement of its engine.
The replaced engine -- removed from another Boeing 777 plane grounded at Jinnah International Airport -- was airlifted to Muscat on March 10 on a C-130 cargo plane.
Carrying 392 passengers, flight PK-714 from Madina to Islamabad had to make an emergency landing at Muscat airport after one of its engines suddenly failed at an altitude of 35,000 feet.
In the past 23 years, the PIA posted some profits only since 2002 till 2004 and that too by virtue of a bailout package of Rs20 billion. However, the abnormal oil price hike over the subsequent few years in conjunction with an extended EU ban due to safety concerns, on most of its planes for flying to Europe in 2007, caused a major dent upon its profitability.
By 2012, primarily driven by an aging fleet, the PIA’s annual spend on fuel had increased to 54% of the total vis-a-vis 24% in 2003. Continuing the trend by 2017, its accumulated losses had risen to Rs356 billion.
Later, in lieu of the fake degrees’ scandal and associated safety concerns, the PIA was debarred from the EU, UK, USA and Canada in 2020, further affecting its revenues.
