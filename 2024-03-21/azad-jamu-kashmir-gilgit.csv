0,Rawalpindi enforces gear for riders,It has been decided to strictly enforce the law to ensure the safety of riders’ lives,"The Labour Welfare Department has taken notice of the daily accidents occurring to motorcycle riders of private companies due to the non-availability of personal protection equipment for safety.
It has been decided to strictly enforce the law to ensure the safety of riders’ lives. The Labour Welfare Department Director General has issued a formal circular in the name of all rider companies.
DG Kalsoom Hai, issued a circular to riding companies, including Careem, Uber, In Drive and Yango, stating that under Section 19 of the Punjab Occupational Safety and Health Act 2019, it is the responsibility of the employer to provide the rider with a helmet, mask, gloves, glasses, raincoat, and hand sanitiser during duty.
In this regard, it came to her notice that all such facilities were not being provided to the riders, exposing them to dangers that constitute a crime under the relevant law, with a penalty of up to Rs100,000 and the employer is bound to compensate the rider for any injuries.

1,‘Wildlife protection force’ in the offing,Wildlife dept will embark on groundbreaking zoological survey aimed at protecting animals,"The Department of Wildlife Conservation will be conducting a zoological survey of wild animals which will help create a “wildlife protection force”, that would be in charge of breeding endangered species of wild animals.
The zoological survey will collect computerised data of all species and numbers of animals present in all public and private forests and national parks of Punjab, including the biodiverse regions of Rawalpindi division. Data for each division’s forests will be separately organised and details of animals found will be collected and computerised. Special funds will be allocated in the new budget for this survey.
Data of wild deer, nilgai, chinkara, wildebeest, fox, jackal, tiger, cheetah, elephant, wild sheep, monkey, leopard, giraffe, urial, zebra and aquatic wild animals will also be collected. After the data collection, steps will be taken to breed the wild animals as needed to conserve each species.
The zoological survey of wild animals will start in the July to August period. This survey will be completed in three to four months. Separate teams will survey the regions of South Punjab, Central Punjab and North Punjab.
This survey will compile data for each area division separately for more descriptive statistics. Following the data compilation, breeding measures and suitable environments will be developed in all surveyed forests.
Currently, the Wildlife Department is suffering from a shortage of staff. About 50% of its positions are vacant, due to which the department’s staff cannot carry out operations against illegal poachers.
The plan is to provide the recruits who will make up the wildlife protection force weapons, walkie-talkies and motorcycles for jungle field duty.
Wildlife Department Deputy Director, Zahid Ali said that the first zoological survey of wild animals has been approved by Senior Minister Maryam Aurangzeb. Work has been started in this regard and the survey will be started within the next three months as funds are made available.

2,Easter preparations in full swing,Decoration of churches and Easter shopping gain momentum in twin cities,"The Christian community in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad will celebrate Easter with great zeal and fervour on March 31. March 29 will be the community’s Good Friday.
On the occasion of Easter, the Christian community has stepped up its shopping spree. The government has also issued instructions to pay salaries to the Christian employees of all institutions by March 25. March 30 will be the last fast and will be the moon night of the Christian community.
As Easter approaches, the shopping activities of the Christian community in markets and commercial centres have also reached their peak. Commercial Market, Moti Bazar, Saddar, Asia’s largest Tench Bhatta Bazar, Raja Bazar, Iqbal Road and commercial plazas are open till 1am these days.
After the shopping of the Christian community is completed, the Muslim community’s Eidul Fitr shopping will reach its peak. Easter and Eidul Fitr are also almost coming together, giving major benefits to businessmen and traders. Cashing in on the situation, traders have also hiked the prices of all types of garments, shoes and artificial jewellery for females.
Customers’ rush to the markets till late hours has disturbed the traffic flow in the city. Bohar Bazaar, Saddar Bazaar, Iqbal Road, Raja Bazaar and Moti Bazaar have witnessed severe traffic problems.
On the other hand, Christians have started decorating the churches situated in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Special prayers are also being held.
Police have prepared a foolproof security plan for Easter and Eidul Fitr. Policemen will be deployed outside all churches. The CCTV cameras will be installed at all churches till the conclusion of the Easter day.
Christian leaders Babu Sajid and Rashid Chauhan have urged foolproof security of the churches on the eve of Easter.

3,Tailors jack up rates as demand skyrockets,Eye record profits on the back of festive season,"With an uptick in demand for stitching clothes for the festive seasons of Easter and Eidul Fitr, tailors in the garrison city of Rawalpindi have jacked up prices for stitching clothes.
Bolstered by rising demand, the tailoring fee for men's suits has risen to Rs1,700. Usually, bookings continue until the 15th of Ramazan, after which bookings cease. Similarly, women in various neighbourhoods have seen an increase in suit stitching prices from Rs1,500 to Rs1,600, while higher-quality stitching with buckram and double stitching now costs Rs1,900, causing concerns among customers.
In the open market, prices of unstitched plain clothes have also reached their peak.
Like previous years, this year too the tailoring shops were seen overcrowded with customers to get their clothes stitched for Eid.
Comparing prices to last year's Ramazan, one can see tailoring fees increasing by Rs1,000 to Rs1,200.
The Christian community, gearing up for Easter celebrations on March 31, traditionally brings in men's and women's shalwar kameez suits for stitching in large quantities, marking a busy period for tailors. This trend extends into Eidul Fitr, further driving the demand for tailored clothing.
The anticipation of these festivals has prompted tailors to adopt round-the-clock services, with some operating in two shifts and hiring temporary help to manage the workload. Many tailors have expanded their services to include stitching shalwar for women and shirts for men, women, and children. This surge in demand has led to an increase in stitching rates, which are expected to reach Rs2,000, with higher rates for double stitching in the final week.
Aurangzeb Malik, Secretary of the Tailors Union in District Rawalpindi, explained that the rising costs of raw materials have contributed to a 500 per cent increase in sewing expenses. The use of good-quality buckram has become prohibitively expensive, impacting the overall cost of stitching. Despite the seasonal peaks during Eidul Fitr, Eid Miladun Nabi, and Eidul Azha, there is a noticeable slowdown during Eid al-Azha and Eid Milad.
Concerns about fair pricing have been raised by individuals like Muhammad Banaras, who believe that the current stitching rates, especially Rs1,700 for a shalwar kameez suit, are unjustified. Calls for the deputy commissioner to intervene and regulate stitching rates for men, women, and children's clothing reflect the community's concerns about affordability and fairness in tailoring services.

6,Call for raising tobacco taxation to save lives,About 19.7% of total adults use tobacco in Pakistan,"Experts have called for raising taxes on tobacco in Pakistan to save lives. Dr Zaman, the founding chairman of the Department of Sociology at Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) and head of the Zaman Research Centre, underlined the need for imposing more taxes to save lives.
“Taxing tobacco saves lives by reducing consumption and channelling resources towards essential public health initiatives,” he said, adding affordability of the cigarettes was the major contributor to high consumption and ultimately diseases and fatalists in the country.
Dr Zaman further said the increasing prices of cigarettes were an internationally proven strategy to curtail their consumption. He endorsed the alignment of tobacco taxation with the guidelines outlined by the World Health Organisation (WHO), emphasizing the imperative to develop a long-term taxation policy grounded in global best practices and Article 6 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).
To substantiate his argument of making cigarettes unaffordable to curb consumption, he referred to a recent research report by Capital Calling that said that an increase in the prices of cigarettes has resulted in a decrease in consumption.
The Islamabad-based think tank Capital Calling reported that “one in every ninety-four smokers was forced to quit smoking after a significant raise in taxes.” The interviews with the smokers and data collected from these cities show that they are now saving money by quitting smoking to fulfil other needs like food, education and health of their children, and paying utilities. More than 31 million Pakistani adults (15+) or about 19.7% of the total adults use tobacco, which is one of the highest in the world,” the report further said.
Malik Imran, the Country Head of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, highlighted the staggering economic toll of tobacco consumption, citing an annual loss of Rs615 billion. Referring to a World Bank report, he said that there was ample room to increase tax on tobacco products. “The government can generate additional Rs65 billion from the industry by increasing the tax up to 26%,” he said.
The Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) had earlier pointed out deficiencies in the tax collection framework as well as the need for increasing taxes on tobacco products, particularly cigarettes. The institute has published a detailed report, based on government data, which states that the country lost Rs567 in revenue during the last seven years.
The report titled ""Tobacco Taxation in Pakistan: Unraveling the revenue loss of Rs567b to the exchequer,"" has unearthed the staggering financial toll inflicted by the tobacco industry on the national exchequer.

7,Life renewed: Rawalpindi man’s organs save seven,Seven unprecedented transplants from a single body make medical history in Pakistan,"The death of a young man has recently injected new life into seven people after an unprecedented transplant of seven donated organs in the medical history of the country.  
Both kidneys, eyes, liver, heart and pancreas obtained through transplant will now allow the recipients to cherish their lives. They will always consider themselves as part of Uzair bin Yasin’s body.
Uzair, who hailed from the district of Bagh in Azad Kashmir and only lived 36 springs of his life, was the owner of a cosmetic store in Rawalpindi. He was taken to the CMH Hospital after his condition deteriorated all of a sudden. A CT scan revealed that Uzair’s brain had died. He was immediately transferred to the Safari Hospital in Bahria Town. Over time, Uzair’s sister Dr Seema, who provides emergency services at a hospital in the UK, and his other sister Dr Sadaf, who is in Pakistan, were sent the CT scan reports. They didn't take much time to acknowledge this fact.
Meanwhile, Uzair was shifted to a ventilator. After consulting with their sister-in-law Faiza Hussain and other family members, the two sisters made a big decision that Uzair’s body organs should be donated when the ventilator comes off.
Before his burial at the graveyard of Gulistan Colony, expert doctors of Bahria Safari Hospital and Pakistan Institute of Kidney and Liver Institute (PKLI) Lahore removed two kidneys, liver and pancreas and both eyes safely and started the process of transplant of these organs in other patients.
For the first time in Pakistan, the team of doctors from Bahria Safari Hospital led by Dr Naveed Sarwar, HOD Nephrology, Major General (retired) Dr Arshad Mahmood, HOD Urology, Dr Ruqqiya Tahir, Brigadier Dr Sarwar Alvi, Dr Faisal, Dr Ismail and Dr Ali Mirza, played a crucial role in the successful transplantation of seven organs.
After experiencing kidney failure multiple times due to dialysis, twenty-year-old Raja Ali Riaz and Zainab Imtiaz each underwent kidney transplants, and they are now leading normal lives. By grafting a part of the same liver, Hamdan from Kohat has been given a new life at the age of seven. He is currently in the ICU of a hospital, and the doctor says he will recover soon. The remaining portion of Uzair’s liver is to be transplanted into another patient at the PKLI.
Another patient Hasnain Ahmed, who was suffering from severe discomfort due to diabetes, has also been given a new life through the liver transplant. Both corneas of Uzair, which have been transferred to the eye bank of Al-Shifa Trust Hospital, will undergo transplantation in two separate patients.
Uzair’s wife Faiza Hussain, ten-year-old daughter Urwa Uzair, mother and doctor sisters have also met the patients who were donated organs.
Uzair’s cousin Faisal Rafiq told The Express Tribune that Uzair was a compassionate and loving young man who used to find solace in his life by helping the poor and needy. Now his soul will surely find peace as seven people have been given new lives thanks to the organs donated from his body, he added.
“Our family is now satisfied with the thought that though Uzair is no more, his presence will always be felt in the form of these seven people,” Faisal said.
Deputy Assistant Administrator of Bahria Safari Hospital, Dr Saim bin Saeed said that transplanting organs from one body to seven people is the first case in the history of Pakistan.

8,"Health authority, vendors lock horns over testing","Officials visit markets, collect samples from shops and verify workers' health cards","The Rawalpindi Health Authority and the city's grocery merchants, bakers, and sweet shop owners are once again in conflict over ‘unauthorised’ inspections of water, food materials, and workers' health certificates.
Despite restrictions, health teams ventured into markets across the district to collect samples from shops and verify workers' health cards.
According to sources, this action contradicts the mandate of the Punjab Food Authority, which is responsible for obtaining food samples and workers' health certificates from shops, grocery stores, and bakeries. Despite lacking the authority, health department teams were reportedly conducting inspections in Rawalpindi's markets, checking food materials, collecting water samples, and requesting workers' health certificates. This led to a dispute between shopkeepers and the health teams.
The activity ceased promptly after Saleem Parvez Butt, Central President of the Central Grocery Merchant Association, intervened and alerted the deputy commissioner. The association filed a complaint about the illegal inspections, arguing that the health teams were overstepping their bounds and disregarding the Deputy Commissioner's directives.
The district food authority clarified that the legal authority to collect samples and monitor health certificates rests with them, not the health department. Sources revealed that the situation has become complex due to vested interests within the health department.
The merchant association lodged a written complaint with Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema to resolve the issue. Shopkeepers have announced non-cooperation with health teams starting Tuesday, stating that they will not allow inspections of workers' health cards or provide any samples, including water samples.
This matter will be brought before the deputy commissioner again this week for further resolution.
In January this year, the Rawalpindi District Health Authority withdrew its notices requiring food, beverages, grocery shops, and bakers to get their workers’ medical tests done and provide water samples after a strong backlash from the Grocery Merchants Association.
Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema clarified that the Punjab Food Authority holds the authority to conduct medical tests and inspect water samples from shops. The district health officer is not empowered to take any action in this regard, rendering all previous proceedings null and void.
