Although there are restrictions on how much luggage one can carry when travelling by air, there is no such check when it comes to travelling by train. It was also interesting to see the different things people were loading into the train with them for spending Eid holidays with their loved ones.
There was Mohammd Isfaque, going to Multan on the special Eid Train, who was taking bags full of nimko (saltish savoury items). “What to do? My entire family in Multan wanted this stuff. I received requests for peanuts, chewra, gaathia, channay and what not? I know there is a tradition of cooking vermicelli during this Eid but my family prefers nimko,” he laughingly told Dawn.
There was also the family with a cardboard pressure cooker packing among their other bags, sacks and bundles. When asked where they were headed, they said that they were going to Rawalpindi on the Eid Train. When asked again if they didn’t get pressure cookers in Rawalpindi they chuckled as one of them explained that they had packed their LCD player in the pressure cooker box.

Travellers take with them all sorts of interesting things to celebrate Eid with their loved ones

Another excited family heading to Wazirabad, near Lahore to spend Eid with their grandmother and other brothers, sisters and cousins there had a big orange water cooler among their luggage, in which they said they were taking cooked beef trotters. “The most important things in our luggage are the cooked trotters and the diaper bag as both of our younger children are sick. One is down with fever and the other has diarrhoea,” said Samia, one of the two mothers in the group.
Another young couple also travelling to Lahore were taking with them a cage with two pairs of hummingbirds. “We were finding it difficult to take care of the birds here so decided to offer them as Eid gifts to our relatives there,” said the husband.
One family of five heading to Islamabad had many bags and they had decided to sit on them as they waited for the Eid Train. “Well, we have so many bags, we might as well use them to sit on as the platform benches are taken already,” smiled Sadaqat, mother of three.
Asked if they didn’t plan on coming back to Karachi because it looked like they had packed everything they owned, they explained that they were also taking with them the “tabbar’s [big family’s] luggage”.
“My husband’s family were visiting us sometime ago and they shopped so much that they didn’t have room in their bags for all their things back. So we are now taking their things back with us,” it was explained further.
For some very strange reason a father and son boarding the Eid Train had a broom and a cobweb duster with them. Asked what they planned doing with those, the younger of the two only smiled sheepishly and shrugged before hurrying off.
Pakistan Railways arranges special Eid Trains every year to facilitate travellers during the Eid rush. Two of these trains were to depart from Karachi, one on April 7 from the City Railway Station with Peshawar as its last stop and the other on April 8 (today) from Cantonment Railway Station with Lahore as its last stop.
This first train that left from the City Railway Station on Sunday evening, was to make brief stopovers at the Karachi Cantonment Railway Station and Landhi before heading to Hyderabad, Nawabshah, Rohri, Khanpur, Bahawalpur, Multan Cantt., Khanewal, Shorkot Cantt., Toba Tek Singh, Gojra, Faisalabad, Sangla Hill, Hafizabad, Wazirabad, Lalamusa, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, Taxila Cantt, Attock city and Nowshera to reach Peshawar Cantt at around 1.15am on Tuesday, April 9.
The first Special Eid Train has 17 economy coaches with capacity for 1,110 passengers though there were 1,200 passengers on it, according to Pakistan Railways, which also informed that the first Eid Train earned the Railways more than four million rupees.

1,CTD arrests KP policeman for smuggling arms into Karachi,KARACHI: A policeman serving in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police was on Sunday arrested by the Counter Terrorism...,"KARACHI: A policeman serving in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police was on Sunday arrested by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) for his alleged involvement in the smuggling of arms into Karachi.
CTD official Raja Umer Khattab said that acting on a tip-off, the intelligence wing of the organisation carried out a raid near KMC Sports Complex on Kashmir Road and “foiled a bid to supply illegal arms”.
He said that a suspect, identified as Azharuddin, was arrested and a schoolbag filled with small arms was recovered from his custody.
He said that the held suspect was a “serving policeman of the KP police and belongs to an inter-provincial gang of arms smugglers”.
The official said that the gang was involved in online selling of illegal weapons and its members supplied the same to Karachi and other parts of the country.
He said that suspect Azhar had smuggled illicit arms into Karachi before.
He worked for one Daniyal, who lived in KP, the official said, adding that Daniyal was the key accomplice of three arms dealers — Qadeer, Saddam and Nadeem — in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“These three dealers of arms have supplied a huge quantity of arms in Karachi from KP, he said.
The official claimed that some retired or those law enforcement personnel dismissed on disciplinary were involved in arms trafficking.
He said that usually buyers in Karachi or other parts of the country gave orders to any of the three arms dealers via social media platforms and people like Azhar delivered the same.
The CTD official said that the inspector general of Sindh police had set up an “arms trafficking and monitoring desk” to curb the illicit arms trade.

3,Man in Karachi sentenced to 80 lashes for denying child’s paternity,Flogging punishment awarded under Qazf Ordinance for also making false accusations against ex-wife.,"KARACHI: A sessions court has sentenced a man to 80 lashes for refusing to admit paternity of his child and falsely accusing his ex-wife of adultery.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (Malir) Shehnaz Bohyo convicted Fareed Qadir under Section 7(1) of the Offence of Qazf (Enforcement Of Hadd) Ordinance, 1979 for disowning his legal child and making false accusations against his ex-wife.
The said section of the ordinance reads: “Whoever commits qazf liable to hadd shall be punished with whipping numbering eighty stripes.”
The judge wrote in his verdict: “It is crystal clear that the accused is a liar and had fabricated an allegation of Qazf upon the complainant regarding illegitimacy of her daughter… Thus, he is convicted and sentenced to 80 stripes each under section 7(1) of the Qazf Ordinance, 1979.”
The court ruled that after the conviction, his evidence shall not be admissible in any court of law following the confirmation of the conviction from the Federal Shariat Court.

Flogging punishment awarded under Qazf Ordinance

“As the accused is sentenced to whipping only… he shall remain on bail, provided that he agrees to appear at the time and place designated by this court for the execution of the punishment of whipping, following the confirmation of the conviction and sentence by the court of appeal, and submits a bail bond in the sum of Rs100,000,” said the verdict.
The convict’s ex-wife had filed a complaint in court and stated that she got married in February 2015 and they lived together for one month. In December 2015, she gave birth to a baby girl. However, her ex-husband failed to provide maintenance or take her back to his home. When she moved a family court the judge rendered a decree in her favour and directed the convict to provide maintenance for his daughter and former wife.
However, the husband submitted two applications in court during the proceedings of the execution application, requesting a DNA test for the baby girl and disowning his daughter. These applications were subsequently withdrawn by the convict.
However, the complainant filed an application under Sections 200, 203-B of the criminal procedure code (CrPC) read with Sections 3, 5, 7, and 11 of the Qazf Ordinance, 1979, before the district and sessions court (Malir), seeking legal remedy against her ex-husband for levelling serious allegations against her.
During the trial, the accused denied allegations regarding his ex-wife, stating that she had only lived with him for six hours after their marriage and then left the home and never returned.
However, the court noted that the accused neither testified under oath nor produced any witnesses to support his claims, adding that the defence also failed to bring any evidence regarding the accused making an apology or filing applications over a misunderstanding.
The court also highlighted that the accused in his recorded statement under Section 342 of the CrPC admitted that a baby girl was his legitimate daughter.
Prosecutor Saira Bano told Dawn that she did not witness any convictions of flogging under Section 7 of the Qafz Ordinance during her 14 years of service as a lawyer.
She explained that the implementation of the punishment of 80 lashes is subject to confirmation or otherwise by the court of appeal.
She believed that the recent conviction could be the first instance of corporal punishment in many decades.

4,Modern strategies may ease Karachi traffic woes,"Multimodal transportation, development of ""complete streets"" can reduce traffic congestion, environmental pollution in city.","KARACHI: The city experiences severe traffic congestion on all main roads throughout the year. Roads, like M.A. Jinnah Road, Sharea Faisal, I.I. Chundrigar Road, and University Road remain clogged with vehicles while Saddar is in perpetual state of traffic congestion.
Causes of traffic congestion include increased car ownerships, in-disciplined and disorderly traffic, poor condition of roads, insensible traffic management, and a relatively new cause, sewage on roads.
According to the American Federal Highway Administration, congestion usually relates to an excess of vehicles on a portion of roadway at a particular time resulting in speeds that are slower — sometimes much slower — than normal or ‘free flow’ speeds. Congestion often means stopped or stop-and-go traffic.
 
 

Vehicles emit a large variety of air pollutants, like particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, lead, and volatile organic compounds.

Multimodal transportation, development of ‘complete streets’ can reduce traffic congestion, environmental pollution in city

PM includes PM10 (particles of size less than 10 microns in diameter, and PM2.5 (size less than 2.5 microns).
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), PM is capable of penetrating deep into the lung and enters the bloodstream causing cardiovascular (ischemic heart disease), cerebrovascular (stroke) and respiratory impacts. Long-term exposure has been further linked to adverse perinatal outcomes and lung cancer. In 2013, it was classified as a cause of lung cancer by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).
Three very recent studies link PM2.5 exposure to Alzheimer’s disease. The exhaust from diesel-powered vehicles (water bowsers, trucks, buses and mini-buses) is even more deadly.
The diesel particulate matter (DPN) is small enough to be inhaled into the lungs, and some are deposited on the lung surface, and in the deepest regions of the lungs where the lung is most susceptible to injury. California has classified DPM as a toxic air contaminant. IARC has listed diesel engine exhaust as ‘carcinogenic to humans’.
 
 

It is estimated that in California, about 70 per cent of total known cancer cases are attributable to DPM.
In Karachi, some measures were adopted in the past, like signal-free roads, one-way couplet system, and U-turn infrastructure. But, nothing worked to ease congestion. In Saddar, a huge parking building was constructed, which is now used by drug addicts.
The 2021 Urban Mobility Report of the Texas Transportation Institute gives out a useful guidance: “The right solution to a mobility issue, however, is not the same everywhere all the time. Every solution is targeted somewhere to accomplish a specific goal, but every solution is not right for every location, opportunity, or problem. Context is the important starting point for identifying mobility solutions.”
To ease congestion in London, congestion pricing (charging for entering congested areas) was introduced. The result, according to a blogger, “London cars move no faster than chickens. Cars in central London now travel at the speed of a running chicken, instead of a running house mouse.”
Consider this simple arithmetic: assuming there are 50,000 cars in Karachi. If 40,000 cars are taken out, the remaining 10,000 will not cause traffic congestion.
How can that be done? Simple, all that is required is the strong political will, and hard work on part of the Sindh transport department.
Ban car parking spaces in new buildings, and ban on street parking. This will put a squeeze on car ownerships, forcing car owners to leave their vehicles in residences.
Parking reforms and cost can be important policy variables. But there has to be a viable alternative to the cars (transit, bicycles, and walkways) for the people.
Minneapolis, a city in the US state of Minnesota, has banned parking space requirements in new buildings. Minnesota State Senator Omar Fateh announced the ‘People Over Parking’ legislation. He said; “These mandates also often force people to build far more parking than they need, and they’re especially burdensome to renters.”
 
 

The Norwegian capital, Oslo, developed a strategy with objectives of reducing car traffic by 33pc by 2030 (compared with 2015 levels). The city administration set an ambitious agenda to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, become fossil fuel free by 2030 and to make Oslo an even better place to live. Transport accounted for some 60pc of the city’s carbon dioxide emissions with almost 40pc coming from private cars.
In Austin, Texas, authorities are advocating public transportation usage, pedestrian walking paths, and carpooling schemes that would help reduce clogged-up streets across Austin’s suburbs. This could be an effective way for residents to lower their contribution to traffic.
Austin is implementing transit-oriented development, which is expected to generate a range of benefits, including reducing car use and relieving traffic congestion. The city is striving to have multimodal transportation (walking, biking, transit, rail, cars and trucks). Multimodal access supports the needs of all users whether they choose to walk, bike, use transit or drive. It means more connections and more choices, with easy access to move from point A to point B.
Parking reforms have been undertaken in Oregon, Colorado, San Francisco, Atlanta, Portland and Hartford.
A number of studies have demonstrated that constrained parking forced households to drive fewer miles. Conversely, the researchers at State Smart Transportation Initiative of University of Wisconsin-Madison found that parking increases citywide car use.
In Nottingham, UK, a Workplace Parking Levy led to mode shift away from the car use.
Another paper examined the traffic congestion in London, Stockholm and Singapore. It was found that upon the imposition of congestion charges, after an initial decrease in traffic for a brief period, the traffic returned to the initial state, forcing the authors to conclude that, “evidence from these cities provides little support for the general use of congestion charging to limit demand for car use in urban areas”.
Karachi’s traffic should be designed for multimodal transportation. The streets need to be designed as complete streets (complete streets are developed for use by people and not just cars. And has convenient connectivity with bike lanes, pedestrian crossings, transit-friendly mode and sidewalks).
If nothing is done, then, perhaps, people will be left, in the words of Joni Mitchell’s song: Big Yellow Taxi — they paved paradise and put up a parking lot.

5,This week 50 years ago: Water crisis and Rasheed Arain’s environmental art,THE issue of shortage of civic amenities reared its head in Karachi as soon as the city began to expand both...,"THE issue of shortage of civic amenities reared its head in Karachi as soon as the city began to expand both vertically and horizontally (that is, in terms of infrastructural development and population). On April 9, 1974 a story in Dawn suspected that a serious crisis of water supply was likely to hit Karachi in 1975 because of the delay in the execution of the first part of the third phase of the Bulk Water Supply Scheme. The reason was the non-receipt of funds from the provincial government. There was already a shortfall of 25 million gallons of water on a daily (MGD) basis since only 140m gallons were being supplied to the city. The requirement was 165 MGD. With the continuing rise in population, Karachi needed 185 MGD by the next year. Experts said the pinch would be felt by the consumers in May (1974) and in the succeeding months the trouble could aggravate. 
Not just that, the authorities were trying to find a solution to the grave problem of impure drinking water as well. On April 10, Dow Medical College (DMC) started sample testing of drinking water in its laboratory complying with the directives of the provincial government. The test was in addition to the one being done by the Karachi Development Authority (KDA).
It seemed that no good news was in the offing on the subject. On April 14, it was announced that Karachi would get turbid water from Haleji Lake after two days due to the closure of Jam Branch Canal along with other canals in Sindh for annual cleaning, distilling and weed removal. The effects of the change would, however, be noticed in the city from April 18 and the supply from Haleji Lake was to be restored in the first week of May.
Impure water has to do with pollution. Interestingly, on April 11, renowned artist Rasheed Arain staged Karachi’s first demonstration in environmental art at Jheel Park in PECHS. To launch 16 fluorescent discs into the lake, the artist invited a couple of kids and some grownups who used them like a discus thrower would. Initially, the 24-inch diameter discs made a circular pattern. As they were carried towards the centre of the lake, the pattern changed. The ducks in the water received the creative process with a mixed reaction. They first got scared but after a while the curious birds approached the discs and swam along with them. Subsequently, the artist proceeded to Indus Gallery where an exhibition of photographs pertaining to the demonstration was held.
From one essential commodity to another: on April 14, M Q Zaman, the Managing Director of the Karachi Gas Company (KGC) at the annual general meeting of the company’s shareholders said the KGC had pressed the government for an upward revision in the price of gas to cover increases in operational and developmental costs. According to him, there had been an increase in the number of domestic connections which were uneconomical for the gas company. He nonetheless claimed that the KGC was earning profit, and ‘in spite of losses on investments in Bangladesh and depreciation in the market value on investments in Pakistan, it had maintained a divided of 12.5 per cent’.

The victims had been kidnapped near a famous restaurant in Karsaz and Rs20 million was demanded from their family by the kidnappers.
Sharing details, DIG Haider said that two people Abdullah and Shahid came from Punjab to Karachi to meet a travel agent who had assured them to take them to Italy in return of Rs35,000,000.  
When they arrived to meet the agent within the remit of Bahadudrabad police station, the agent asked them to sit in his car for a biometric/thumb impression. The agent took away these two men in his car and later on their families received a call from a foreign WhatsApp number demanding Rs20 million ransom.  On receiving the case, the AVCC and the CPLC teams started working on the case on ‘technical ground’. 
The AVCC conducted a raid at a factory/hideout in the SITE area of Karachi from where two kidnap victims were recovered safely and four kidnappers were arrested from the hideout with bullet wounds, a statement added.  
The CIA chief said the suspects were being interrogated.

7,Experts discuss plans for conservation of coastal resources,"The initiatives are aimed at protecting depleting natural resources, livelihood 
of local fishermen and tackle climate change","KARACHI: Highlighting the multiple threats the coastal areas face in Pakistan, speakers at a workshop called for developing and implementing comprehensive conservation plans in consultation with relevant stakeholders.
Such plans, they said, would help protect depleting natural resources and livelihood of local fishers as well as tackle climate change.
Titled Participatory Conse­rvation Plans (PCP) for the Indus Delta, the workshop was held at a local hotel.
During the programme, the participants were given a detailed briefing on the conservation plans developed under the Sustainable Mangroves Management and Community Development in the Indus Delta project.
It’s supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and WWF-Germany and being implemented by World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-P).

The initiatives are aimed at protecting depleting natural resources, livelihood of local fishermen and tackle climate change

These plans, it was pointed out, aimed at promoting sustainable resource consumption, improving biodiversity conservation and enhancing ecosystem integrity through integrated participatory management approaches.
“The plans also intended to mitigate the poverty of local fishers and farmers, reduce environmental degradation, improve socio-economic conditions, and enhance community livelihoods,” Manager WWF-P Jawad Umer Khan said.
A comprehensive set of management initiatives had been outlined to foster sustainable mangrove management and natural resource conservation through these plans, he added.
“As the plans are at the initial stage, WWF-Pakistan is seeking feedback and recommendations from relevant stakeholders to further improve and finalise them,” he said.
Commenting on the plans, Mr Khan said that they recommended various actions such as promotion of aquaculture, seaweed farming, eco-tourism and women’s involvement in handicraft production to diversify income sources and reduce pressure on fisheries.
“These initiatives include the implementation of measures to stabilise the shoreline and prevent erosion and promote alternative fodder and multi-purpose crops in mangrove areas.
“It also includes identification and plantation of suitable mangrove species that are resilient to environmental stressors and are conducive to biodiversity conservation. The plans also emphasise the use of nature-based solutions to address environmental challenges and enhance the resilience of coastal ecosystems,” he said.
During the programme, participants shared concerns over the steep decline in freshwater flows, sea intrusion, coastal flooding, and other associated factors that had led to degradation of the fertile lands of the Indus delta and consequent loss of livelihood of local farmers and fishers.
Arif Ali Khokhar, Conservator Sindh Forest Department, said that the plans addressed the common features of overexploitation and degradation of natural resources in the coastal region of Sindh and that they were essential to conserve mangroves forests, improve biodiversity, and promote alternative livelihoods in the Indus delta.
“As a result of the joint efforts of the forest department, WWF-Pakistan, local communities, and other organisations, the mangrove cover has now increased to around 240,000 hectares,” he told the audience.
Dr Ali Muhammad Mastoi, director general Sindh Fisheries Department, said fisheries resources had been decreasing in recent decades due to mangroves degradation, unsustainable fishing practices, use of trawling, and water pollution in coastal waters of Karachi and the Indus river.
He emphasised that there was a need to promote sustainable fishing practices and provide alternative livelihood options to the local fishers.
Vinod Kumar, WWF- P project coordinator recalled that the Indus delta was once home to a myriad of fish species, birds, diverse animals, and thick mangrove forests when it used to receive ample flows of freshwater. Local communities in those days used to cultivate red rice, peas, mangoes, bananas, vegetables and raised livestock.
“However, with reduced flow of freshwater and increased pollution, this thriving delta started to dwindle. The mangroves’ cover in the Indus delta decreased to 86,000 hectares in 2005. These forests, however, are now being restored with the joint efforts of various departments and local communities.”
Part of the workshop was a discussion on the implementation strategies for the plans and roles and responsibilities of different departments.
The workshop participants included Niaz Memon, Additional Director, Social Welfare Department; Fayyaz Salih Hussain, Assistant Director, Sindh Envi­ronmental Agency (Sindh Environmental Protection Agency); Dr Asim Karim Director Fisheries, Sindh Fisheries Department, and members of local communities from Keti Bunder, Kharo Chan, and Shah Bundar.

8,Sindh IGP says police to get sophisticated Turkish arms soon to fight dacoit gangs,Observes morale of field force high despite heavy loss of life inflicted by outlaws in initial phases of operation.,"SUKKUR: Sindh Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon on Saturday said that his department had been suffering heavy losses of men and material in the ongoing fight against dacoit gangs because the latter were equipped with more sophisticated weapons.
However, he added, the Sindh government was procuring matching weaponry for the police and such a consignment from Turkey would be arriving within the next two weeks.
 
 

IGP Memon was speaking to the media in the office of the Kandhkot SSP on Sunday after presiding over a meeting of top-ranking police officers of Larkana and Sukkur police ranges.
Larkana DIG Nasir Aftab Pathan briefed the provincial police chief about the achievements and shortcomings in the months-long operations against dacoit gangs in upper Sindh districts.
Kandhkot-Kashmore SSP Bashir Ahmed Brohi, Larkana SSP Mir Ruhal Khan Khoso, Shikarpur SSP Irfan Samoo, Jacobabad SSP Syed Saleem Ali Shah and other senior police officers gave their inputs about security situation in their respective jurisdictions. Kandhkot-Kashmore Deputy Commissioner Amir Fazal Owaisi and other district administration officials were also present at the meeting.

Observes morale of field force high despite heavy loss of life inflicted by outlaws in initial phases of operation

The meeting discussed in detail the progress of joint police-Rangers operations, being carried out on intelligence-based information, in the gang-infested riverine areas of Sukkur, Kandhkot-Kashmore, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Larkana and Qambar-Shahdadkot districts.
The IGP told the media that incidents of kidnapping for ransom had been restricted to Kandhkot and Shikarpur areas due to the operations. He claimed that only nine hostages had now remained in gangs’ custody in the riverine area of Kandhkot-Kashmore district and police were carrying out an effective operation there for the safe recovery of the victims.
‘Morale of police high’
While expressing his grief over martyrdom of many police officers and personnel before and during the initial phase of the police-Rangers operations in the strife-torn districts of upper Sindh, IGP Memon appreciated members of the police force for having maintained immense pressure on the dreaded gangs despite being lesser equipped than the outlaws.
He pointed out that the police force inflicted considerably heavy losses to gangsters and other criminals over the last few years. Many criminals had been killed and many more wounded and arrested, he noted.
He observed that morale of the police force in field was high, and reiterated his department’s resolve to eliminate all gangs of criminals in the riverine areas of Sindh very soon.
He said complete peace in the entire region would be restored as the police were about to be equipped with sophisticated weapons being procured by the provincial government.
The police chief also mentioned the recent surge in street crimes in Karachi and said that his department was working hard to maintain law and order in the mega city as well. He said police needed support of the media and general public for success of the operations in Karachi and all other parts of the province.
Honey trap and tribal hostilities
Answering different questions posed by media persons, IGP Memon said the outlaws in upper Sindh had been changing their modus operandi since 2015. In this regard, he pointed out that the gangs involved in kidnapping for ransom had resorted to adopting the tactics of honey trap, targeting youths.
Their victims used to be engaged in friendship through telephonic calls made by gangsters in female voice and then invited to a place close to a riverine area for a date.
 
 

The youths were kidnapped upon reaching the place, he recalled, and said the police also succeeded in curbing such incidents with the help of modern technology. As many as 529 people were saved from being kidnapped through honey trap within just three months, he said.
Tribal feuds, often ending up in armed attacks and clashes leading to bloodshed, are one of the main factors behind lawlessness in upper Sindh districts, according to the IGP.
“Crimes rate has increased owing to tribal feuds in certain districts,” he said, and repeated his appeal to feudal lords of the areas, often accused of patronising criminal gangs, to help government and police by making positive efforts towards getting all types of disputes settled.
Missing girls
About efforts by police to locate and recover missing girls, Priya Kumari and Fazila Sarki, the provincial police chief said that the home department had lately constituted another joint investigation team (JIT) to ascertain whereabouts of Priya Kumari, who had gone missing on Aug 19, 2021 at the age of about seven. The JIT hoped she would be located and recovered soon as it had collected some testimonies and evidence during its probe started on April 2, he said.
Regarding Fazila Sarki’s case, he said it appeared to be an old case and police could not find a clue to her because nobody had come forward with a piece of evidence regarding her disappearance.
In reply to a question about the recent murder of an activist working for promotion of education, Allah Rakhio Nandwani, a primary teacher by profession, IGP Memon said the Kandhkot police were taking effective measures for the arrest of his killers.

9,JSQM demands arrest of killers of founding chief Bashir Qureshi,NAWABSHAH: Activists of the Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz staged a demonstration outside local press club on Sunday...,"NAWABSHAH: Activists of the Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz staged a demonstration outside local press club on Sunday demanding arrest of the ‘killers’ of the party’s founder chairman Bashir Khan Qureshi, who died in mysterious circumstances at the age of 54 on April 7, 2012, in Sakrand.
The cause of Qureshi’s death was reported to be cardiac arrest but the party never accepted it and suspected he had been murdered. 
Local party leaders Ali Raza Khaskheli, Sarfaraz Memon, Kashif Lakho and others paid homage to their leader and said that Qureshi was eliminated for raising voice for the protection and preservation of Sindh’s natural resources.
They lamented that many years had passed since his ‘murder’ but killers had not been arrested yet. They demanded immediate arrest of the killers.
According to sources in the party, on April 7, 2012, Qureshi was touring different areas in connection with the party’s organisational activities when he suddenly fell unconscious after having dinner with other party workers in Sakrand. 
He complained of pain in the chest followed by a bout of cough and was taken to a local hospital, where he passed away at around 2:45 am. 
Some party cadre suspected that Qureshi might have been poisoned because he had no history of heart issues. Later, a medical team carried out autopsy on Qureshi’s body at the Chandka Medical College Hospital, Larkana, but its report was kept under the wraps.   
Although, a 15-member committee of forensic experts constituted by the Sindh government to investigate the cause of Qureshi’s death did find some amount of organo-phosphate in Qureshi’s viscera, they concluded that it did not prove foul play.

10,Protest held over ‘extrajudicial killing’ by police in Thatta,"THATTA: Activists of political parties, nationalist groups and sympathisers of an alleged victim of ‘staged’...","THATTA: Activists of political parties, nationalist groups and sympathisers of an alleged victim of ‘staged’ encounter held a demonstration outside local press club on Sunday to register protest against what they described as extrajudicial murder of Rafique Khaskheli by Thatta police earlier this week.
The protesters deplored that police were victimising local citizens through ‘staged’ encounters and claimed that Khaskheli was shot dead at the behest of an influential person. 
He was first promoted as a dangerous criminal and then targeted in a fake encounter, they said.
Yasir Jakhro of Qaumi Awami Tehreek said that Thatta police were clearly trampling upon the rights of citizens laid down in the Constitution as they had taken the law into their own hands.
“As per law, police have to produce a suspect in court but Thatta police have been punishing suspects on their own,” they said.
Khaskheli’s brothers said that despite the fact that he had no criminal record, he was treated as a ‘notorious criminal’. 
They demanded a transparent and impartial probe into the episode.

11,New treatment for liver cancer introduced,KARACHI: The benefits of a cutting-edge treatment for liver cancer were highlighted at a seminar organised by Dr...,"KARACHI: The benefits of a cutting-edge treatment for liver cancer were highlighted at a seminar organised by Dr Ziauddin Hospital that has recently introduced the procedure at its facility.
According to officials, the Radioembolization Therapy (Tare) is a groundbreaking approach that has been introduced for the first time in Pakistan. It would revolutionise the fight against hepatobiliary cancers, which constitute a significant portion of malignancies (10.7 per cent of all cancers) in adult males in Pakistan.
“Radioembolization is a unique, safe, and efficacious method for treating liver cancer. It involves a minimally invasive procedure that combines embolisation and radiation therapy to target cancerous tumors within the liver.
“The treatment carries fewer side effects compared to conventional radiation therapy, as it delivers focused treatment exclusively to cancerous regions while sparing normal tissues. This approach also boasts a shorter recovery period, significantly improving the quality of life and survival for liver cancer patients,” says a press release.
Renowned experts in interventional radiology and nuclear medicine, Prof Murat Cantasdemir and Prof Cuneyt Turkmen from Turkey oversee these procedures during the workshop.

13,"Govt following IMF dictates, claims CPP",Sees worsening inflation in days to come,"HYDERABAD: The Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP) on Sunday described the present federal dispensation as a ‘caretaker’ government which, it said, was managing the country’s affairs on dictates of International Monetary Fund (IMF).
CPP secretary general Imdad Kazi said while chairing his party’s meeting that previous caretaker set-up was actually a representative of the establishment which produced results of its own choice with little changes. In the present government too, important portfolios had been doled out to the persons who were in fact “pawns of the establishment and IMF”, he said.
Kazi said that it was highly deplorable that Pakistan Peoples Party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had voted for such ‘pawns’ to get themselves elected to Senate. 
He said that elections in the country were just a farce considering the fact that they facilitated the rise to power of such people who were not genuine representatives of masses but of IMF and the establishment. 

Sees worsening inflation in days to come 

He said that these people then implemented with some changes all the policies dictated by IMF and the establishment which were aimed at meeting expenses of elite, establishment and imperialist institutions, thus further burdening the masses. 
He foresaw that now national enterprises would be auctioned off in the name of privatisation and prices of petrol, gas, electricity and essential commodities would rise with each passing day. As per official statistics, 40pc of population was living below poverty line and according to World Bank figures another 10 million would slide down the poverty line in the country, he said.
He apprehended that opposition would remain silent on the aggravating situation. The government and opposition would keep playing ‘cat and mouse’ while masses would continuously be looted, he said. 
He said that people had been trapped in the vicious circle of tribal clashes, kidnapping for ransom and hoodlums’ tyranny to deprive them of their voice. 
The Sindh government had surpassed all limits of bad governance, inefficiency, corruption and nepotism, he said.
Kazi said that in order to defeat people’s struggle against corporate farming, incidents of kidnapping for ransom, thefts and brigandry had been increased. All tribal chiefs and waderas, who were part of the government, were involved with criminals, he said. 
He called for police operation under the leadership of some honest officers to eliminate dacoit gangs and their patrons, and said there was no need of a military operation for the purpose. Federal law enforcement agencies had been present in the province since 1992 and receiving billions of rupees from Sindh government yet peace continued to elude the region, he said. 
He said that CPP believed in the struggle for peoples’ rights.
The party’s provincial committee adopted a resolution at the meeting demanding the government to implement notification for fixation of a fair support price for wheat and said the present price was inadequate given hike in the cost of production. Wheat procurement centres should be established as soon as possible, it said.
