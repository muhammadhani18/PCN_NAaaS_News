0,PHC rejects pleas for cancellation of PTI workers’ bail in May 9 cases,Petitions were filed by caretaker government.,"PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court has rejected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government petitions for cancellation of bail granted to three workers of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf in cases pertaining to May 9 violent protests in two cantonments in Dir Lower.
A single-member bench of Justice Mohammad Naeem Anwar turned down two petitions, which were filed by the caretaker provincial government for recalling bails granted to the three suspects.
In one of the petitions, the government had requested for cancellation of bails granted to Amir Afzal and Usman Khan by an anti-terrorism court on November 8, 2023, in a case wherein they along with hundreds of other PTI workers were charged with attacking and vandalising Chakdara Cantonment.
In the other petition, the government had requested to recall the bail granted to Ikhlaq Ahmad by an ATC on November 1, 2023, in a May 9 violent protest in Balambat Cantonment in Dir Lower.

Petitions were filed by caretaker govt

Apart from several other offences, the three suspects have also been charged for sedition.
The petition against Ikhlaq was dismissed as the assistant advocate general, Naeem Khan, didn’t press it. He pointed out that earlier 11 bail cancellation applications were filed before the high court, which were dismissed on December 4, 2023.
He stated that he had gone through that judgment and record of the present case, therefore, he would not press the case.
In the other case, the bench observed that admittedly names of the two respondents didn’t reflect in the FIR rather they were nominated in the case at a belated stage.
“Neither their independent role has been specified nor during the course of arguments any incriminating recovery has been pointed out on the basis of which liberty of the accused could be curtailed,” observed the bench.
“Not only registration of the FIR under certain offences without written complaint on behalf of the competent authority in violation of the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1908, is a matter for resolution by learned trial court but the grounds for cancellation of the respondents’ bail in the present case are also not available before this court,” the bench further observed.
The bench also pointed out that an additional advocate general appearing for the government candidly stated that the matter of cancellation of bail of co-accused persons of the present respondents had already been decided by the high court on December 4, 2023, therefore, the instant petition would not serve any person.
The FIR in the instant case was registered at Chakdara police station wherein SHO Mujeebullah Khan was the complainant.
The complainant had stated that a protest rally was arranged by PTI in the wake of arrest of party’s chairman Imran Khan. He claimed that the rally included around 3,500 to 4,000 protesters.
He alleged that the protesters attacked the staff deputed at the entrance of Chakdara Cantonment, put on fire several vehicles and buildings and also broke into the ammunition store and looted different weapons and ammunition in large quantity.
While granting bail to the two respondents, the ATC had observed that tentative assessment of the record available on file revealed that general role had been attributed to any of the accused and no specific role had been attributed to them and as such their involvement in the occurrence became doubtful.
The caretaker government had claimed that the orders of ATC were against the law, facts and available evidence hence liable to be set aside.

The death of the woman, hailing from Peerokhel area of Landi Kotal, sparked protests by both her family members and civil society activists as the family accused the staff at the gynaecology ward of failure to handle the complicated delivery. They also accused Rescue 1122 officials of refusing to take the patient to a Peshawar hospital for shortage of fuel in their ambulance.
The protesters closed the hospital’s main gate and demanded an impartial inquiry into the alleged negligence of both the hospital staff and Rescue 1122 officials, and registration of an FIR against those found guilty of negligence.
With the situation getting out of control and the number of protesters swelling on the premises of the hospital, Khyber DPO reached the spot on Saturday evening and held talks with the hospital’s management and the aggrieved family members.
In a fit of rage, the DPO also suspended Landi Kotal SHO for his failure to register an FIR on time. However, he later reinstated him upon the request of the relatives of the deceased woman.
The situation was defused and the protesters agreed to disperse only after the DPO’s assurance that the matter would be thoroughly investigated after getting an approval from the area magistrate under Sub-Section 156 of Criminal Procedure Code.

He ordered the officials concerned to collect data of agricultural lands across the province, adding saffron crops being grown in neighboring countries should also be evaluated in order to have better production.
CM Gandapur ordered this while chairing a meeting of agriculture department, said an official statement issued by the chief minister’s secretariat here on Sunday
It said that Mr Gandapur directed relevant authorities to take innovative measures in order to have maximum production with minimum cost, adding that modern farming technology should be introduced and the field of research in agriculture be aligned with contemporary requirements for the purpose.
He urged the authorities to ensure useful utilisation of available agriculture land in the province so as to make it an effective source of income for the provincial government.
The chief minister directed the agriculture department to cultivate land itself instead of giving the same on contracts. He added that farmers should also be encouraged to cultivate saffron in the land suitable for this purpose.
He also ordered the officials concerned to initiate wild olive grafting programme in the merged districts and underlined the need for the construction of small artificial dams to cultivate vegetables in the districts where there was shortage of water.
The chief minister said that drip irrigation system could also be introduced in merged districts, agricultural activities should be carried out keeping in view the specific climatic conditions and other related aspects of different regions of the province.
“Self-sufficiency in agricultural production is much needed to control prevailing inflation,” he said adding that his government would extend its all-out support to agriculture department for the purpose.
He directed the department to take special steps for promoting horticulture and carry out survey for planting suitable fruit trees in every district of the province.
The chief minister made it clear that food security was one of the top priority areas of the provincial government, adding that integrated efforts were needed to ensure speedy implementation of Chashma Right Bank Canal and other major projects in this sector.

4,Patients in KP continue to undergo banned tests for detection of typhoid,Medics recommend blood culture to confirm the ailment and avoid complications.,"PESHAWAR: Patients suspected of having typhoid fever continue to undergo Widal and Typhidot tests at hospitals and private clinics for confirmation of the disease despite ban on these investigations by government, according to sources.
Senior physicians call for an end to these tests and recommend blood culture test to confirm typhoid and avoid complications.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Care Commission issued directives in 2022 that Widal and Typhidot tests should be discontinued and only blood culture should be conducted for confirmation of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid as per guidelines of National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad. However, laboratories continue to receive samples from patients for these tests.
Prof Syed Amjad Taqweem, the chief executive of Health Net Hospital Hayatabad, told Dawn that blood culture was the only way to confirm typhoid. “Widal and Typhidot are useless and should not be conducted at all,” he added.

Medics recommend blood culture to confirm the ailment and avoid complications

According to him, he has been seeing positive Widal tests of patients that cannot be taken as confirmed cases as every typhoid patient requires blood culture. Misuse of antibiotics is cause of the disease while proper use as per culture and sensitivity is its prevention.
“Don’t ever use Azithromycin and Meronem unnecessarily without conducting culture,” said Prof Amjad. He said that almost everyone had XDR in Hayatabad and on top of it now resistance to Azithromycin too.
He said that only effective medicine like Meronem should be coupled with Azithromycin and given in proper dose to patient under the care of consultant. “These medicines should not be used by general practitioners and resistant cases should be referred to consultants to avoid resistance to these also. Any negligence by general practitioners can be catastrophic for community,” he added.
Prof Khalid Mahmood at Peshawar General Hospital said that typhoid fever was common in low income countries like Pakistan that was caused by bacteria called salmonella.
“Once you have the disease, prescription of antibiotics according to culture and sensitivity and for sufficient duration is necessary to treat the index cases and prevent its spread,” he said.
Prof Khalid said that it had become a major public health problem due to the emergence of the resistance. “Lately extensively drug-resistant strains of salmonella are increasing rapidly in Pakistan after the initial reported cases from Sindh few years ago,” he added.
He said that every second patient with typhoid fever was having XDR salmonella. He said that those newly emerging strains were resistant to most of the antibiotics including Flouroquinolone and third generation Cephalosporin. These bugs are sensitive to Carbapenem and Azithromcin mostly.
Carbapenm antibiotics are very expensive and beyond the reach of many patients. This has led to increase in cases of complicated typhoid fever with resultant increase in mortality.
In order to counter this menace, meticulous attention should be paid to personal hygiene and food and water sanitation. Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine is also available and is very effective in preventing the disease.
“We are receiving patients from all over the province as there is outbreak. We need massive vaccination campaign, use of clean drinking water, washing hands and avoidance of excessive use of antibiotics to prevent the disease,” he said.
Prof Khalid, a former physician at Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, said that antibiotics were usually given for typhoid fever diagnosed on the basis of positive Widal or Typhidot tests that were obsolete and not advisable to diagnose the ailment.
“It is strongly recommended to use antibiotics for bacterial infections only and after culture tests,” he said. He said that simple first generation antibiotics should be preferred and certain potent and injectable antibiotics should only be used in hospital settings and on the basis of positive culture report.
“If we continue to misuse antibiotics many more resistant bugs are likely to come up in future and simple surgical procedures would end up in post-operative surgical site infections, leading to increase in morbidity and mortality,” said Prof Khalid.

8,Ruling parties urged to table resolutions on Hazara province in assemblies,TSH chief says struggle for separate federating unit to continue,"MANSEHRA: Tehreek Subah Hazara (TSH) chairman Mushtaq Khan Advocate on Sunday asked the political parties to honour their election commitments of pushing for a separate Hazara province.
“Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, which made creation of Hazara province as part of its election manifesto, should table a resolution in the National Assembly in this regard,” he said while talking to reporters here.
Flanked by senior lawyers, including Mohammad Saleem Awan, Sardar Mohammad Salman, Gulnawaz Khan and Mohammad Javed Khan, he said Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government should also table Hazara province resolution in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
“Our struggle, which had been launched some 40 years ago for a separate province of Hazara, is still on, and we would never deviate from our demand as it is our constitutional right,” Mr Mushtaq vowed.

TSH chief says struggle for separate federating unit to continue

The TSH chairman said the country was passing through a difficult juncture owing to financial and political challenges, and the creation of more federating units was important to tackle such issues.
He observed that mainstream political parties were playing politics in the name of more federating units in the country as none of them had taken any serious measure for the purpose.
Mr Mushtaq said: “We have been seeking justice for the families of those, who died when police opened fire on them during a demonstration in Abbottabad in favour of Hazara province some 14 years ago, but successive governments didn’t pay heed to our demand,” he regretted.

11,Steps sought for revival of calligraphy at school level,Artist says calligraphy helps students to chisel their creative strength,"PESHAWAR: Senior artist Abid Zaman has asked provincial education authorities to revive the art of drawing and calligraphy at school level to widen its scope as it helps students to chisel their creative strength.
In a chat with this scribe, he said that schoolchildren lost their creative faculty to dependence on computer. He added that most experts believed that the art of drawing triggered motor skills in children.
Abid Zaman, a resident of Nowshera district, is recipient of several awards including Gul Gee award, Shahehzada Sultan Hyder award, China youth award, national cultural festival exhibition award, Khewarra salt mine award and Sadequain award. He is presently serving as senior art teacher at a local Folks Grammar School (FGS).
He has participated in international water colour festival in Dubai, Abasin Arts council exhibition in Peshawar and the first Sino-Pak youth exhibition. He has received appreciation from artists for his creative display both in paintings and the art of Islamic calligraphy.

Artist says calligraphy helps students to chisel their creative strength

During his graduation from Sarhad University of Information Technology (SUIT), his major was painting and calligraphy was among his minors but still he shined in the art of Islamic calligraphy. “Since early childhood I would get scolded by messing up walls with sketches and human figures that I used to draw with charcoal but later I made it a career choice to learn that wonderful art,” the artist recalled.
Mr Zaman said that he learnt the intricacies of Khat-i-Sulus and Nastailq from Ustad Sardar Khan and Ustad Nasir Khan, respectively, the former being the oldest called ‘Kufic’ originated in the 7th century while Nastaliq was combination of ‘Naskh’ and ‘Taliq’ formalised towards early 14th century.
The artist stated that he preferred manual learning to digital or graphic designs, which saved time but dented creative faculty. “Therefore, motor skills of schoolchildren remain dormant as their aesthetic sense of visuals including shapes, colours, beauty of order and optical precision lose creative strength,” he added.
He said that drawing used to be practiced in schools just as a fun but in fact all the kinaesthetic of a child could only be triggered through the gradual practice of good handwriting leading to the art of Islamic calligraphy having six different styles.
“I would ask education managers to revive the art of calligraphy at school level to enlarge its academic scope to several other branches of knowledge including medical sciences, modern engineering and architecture,” said Mr Zaman.

They said that the abrupt disruption of gas during the holy month of Ramazan caused difficulties to them. They said that they were relying on gas for preparing Sehr and Iftar in Ramazan.
Numerous complaints have poured in from households across the region including Rang Mohallah, Watekey, Fizagat, Landikas, Malookabad, Panr, Rajabad, Marghuzar Town, Banr and Tahirabad, highlighting the adverse impact of the gas suspension on their daily life.
Locals voiced their concerns regarding the lack of clarity about the reasons of suspension of gas supply.
Fatima Bibi, a resident of the area, said that it was extremely difficult for them to manage without gas, especially during Ramazan. “Cooking meals for Iftar and Sehr becomes nearly impossible without gas supply. We urge the authorities to address this issue promptly,” she added.
Mohammad Khan, another resident, also demanded immediate resolution of the problem. “We are already facing the challenges of fasting during summer. The sudden suspension of gas has only added to our difficulties. The authorities concerned need to take immediate action to restore the supply,” he said.
The absence of gas has disrupted cooking routine and other essential household activities reliant on gas, such as heating water for ablutions and warming homes during cooler evenings.
As the fasting month progresses, the residents of Mingora and its suburbs remain hopeful for a swift resolution to the gas supply issue, which would enable them to observe Ramazan with comfort.
Local officials have assured the residents that efforts are under way to identify the cause of the interruption and restore the gas supply as soon as possible. However, lack of a concrete timeline for resolution has left people anxious and disappointed.
An official of SNGPL said that the mainline had a fault that caused suspension of gas supply to some areas. He said that a technical team had arrived from Lahore and the issue would soon be resolved.

15,Tribunal sets aside transfer order of Landi Kotal hospital MS,Directs govt to probe complaint filed against him,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Services Tribunal has set aside transfer order of medical superintendent of District Headquarters Hospital Landi Kotal and directed the government to conduct proper inquiry over a complaint filed against him.
A two-member bench of the tribunal comprising Ms Rashida Bano and Ms Fareeha Paul issued the order over an appeal filed by Dr Jamshed Saeed challenging his ‘premature’ transfer on Sept 21, 2023, by the government.
The tribunal directed the government to conduct inquiry on a complaint against the appellant by fully associating him with the inquiry and if the complaint was found true then proceed against him in accordance with rules.
Advocate Nazir Ahmad appeared for the appellant and stated that his client was a general medical doctor and through a notification on Sept 10, 2018, he was inducted into Health Management Cadre.

Directs govt to probe complaint filed against him

He stated that the appellant then served as deputy director general health services Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in BPS-19.
He stated that through a notification on May 20, 2022, he was posted as medical superintendent DHQ Hospital Landi Kotal, Khyber district.
He said the appellant was made the MS after several complaints were lodged on Prime Minister Citizen Portal and reports in newspapers were published in respect of worst administration and mismanagement of the hospital including private practice of the doctors during duty hours, continuous absence and non-availability of staff at the time of emergency, etc.
He contended that his client had brought positive changes and reforms in the hospital by taking bold administrative decisions against delinquent employees, which improved the number of patients visiting the OPD and also increased the hospital revenue.
The counsel stated that all of a sudden through the impugned notification on Sept 21, 2023, the appellant had been transferred and directed to report to the director general health services.
He claimed that the appellant was transferred due to pressure of employees on strike.
A deputy district attorney contended that several complaints were received against the appellant, therefore, he was transferred.
He stated that in one of the complaints a lady doctor had complained about visit of the appellant to gynae OPD and labour room without permission.
The tribunal observed that the respondents (government) should have conducted inquiry independently about the complaint to dig out the truth and not transferred the appellant despite knowing the fact that the said lady doctor was a habitual absentee and the appellant had called her explanation and deducted her salary for the days she was absent.
