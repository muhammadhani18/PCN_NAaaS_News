1,Climate policy key to mitigating health risks for vulnerable,Marginalised communities bearing the brunt of adverse fallouts of climate change,"Experts have highlighted the profound challenges faced by vulnerable communities in the wake of climate change-induced natural disasters, suggesting comprehensive policies to mitigate the impact, especially on women and the poor.
Communities, particularly those already marginalised, are bearing the brunt of events such as droughts and floods, exacerbating health risks like undernutrition and malaria.
Talking to APP on Sunday, experts emphasised the intricate relationship between human health and environmental hazards, emphasising the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address these issues.
For many impoverished populations, adapting to climate change is not a choice but a bitter reality.
Research indicates that the poor, especially in developing nations, are disproportionately affected by climate variability and change.
Experts in various findings have examined the myriad ways in which climate change adaptation policies and strategies are developed, and they systematically discuss the factors which either facilitate or hamper the involvement of all stakeholders in the development of these intervention measures.
Our findings indicate that women seem to be the group of people who are mostly unaware of community initiatives, policies, and strategies for adaptation to climate change.
Various studies recommend that to achieve successful public participation in climate change adaptation policy development, there must be an all-inclusive system which incorporates all stakeholders, including vulnerable groups.
However, mainstreaming women-focused resilience-building measures into policymaking is key to lowering their exposure to the adverse fallouts of climate change, particularly floods, Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination spokesperson Muhammad Saleem Shaikh told APP.
He said that building climate resilience in marginalized communities, especially women, by engaging them in climate policymaking and policy implementation processes as well as enhancing investment in women-focused climate risk management programs and actions is an important ingredient in building the climate resilience of women.
The ministry spokesperson highlighted that various studies show that when communities or women are not fully engaged in climate work, programmes are likely to meet with failure, by putting them at greater risk of increased exposure to climate change impacts.
Rapid industrialisation
Talking to APP noted environmentalist Mahmood Khalid Qamar opined that technological advances in agriculture and rapid industrialisation have considerably polluted the two pillars of natural resources, i.e. land, and water.
Toxic chemicals and microbial contaminants/agents created by natural and anthropogenic activities are rapidly becoming environmental hazards (EH) with increased potential to affect the natural environment and human health.
Noted pulmonologist Dr Zeeshan from Jinnah Hospital Lahore says the environment has serious effects on our health in a variety of ways, by significantly impacting human health in two ways, either directly by exposing people to harmful carbon agents or indirectly, by disrupting life-sustaining ecosystems.
Therefore, it is imperative to consider huge poor populations in policymaking as a top priority.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) in its recent report has given its estimation that thirteen million deaths annually are attributable to preventable environmental causes.
Women bearing heavier brunt
The report also estimates that 24 per cent of the global disease burden (healthy life per year loss) and 23 per cent of all deaths i.e. premature mortality among these communities particularly women are attributable to environmental factors, with the environmental burden of diseases, that means 15 times higher in developing countries than in developed countries.
This occurs due to differences in exposure to environmental risks and non-availability of access to health care amid environmental reasons.
The report further says that five children in developing countries every minute die from malaria or diarrhoea.
UN reports further say half of the world’s poor and ignored population was comprised of women and child girls, yet they remained mostly out of the conversation when it came to building the climate resilience of the communities.
According to UN reports, women and girls formulate nearly half of the agricultural labour force in less developed countries including Pakistan.
When provided with the same access to resources as men, women can increase their agricultural yields by 20 to 30 per cent. This boost in productivity, not only improves total agricultural output by 2.5 to 4 per cent, but it can also help reduce world hunger by 12 to 17 per cent.
Another pulmonologist and critical care physician, Dr Muhammad Ahmad said that dramatic occurrences of rising Asthma cases and undernutrition including malnutrition throughout the global cities were increasing at an alarming level.
He said that various environmental synthesis reports are giving precautionary warnings that further erosion of ecosystems could lead to a rise in existing diseases such as malaria and cholera, as well as a rising risk of new emerging viral diseases in the world.
Therefore, thickly populated areas should be at the top agenda and must be included in policy-making.
In response to a query, Ahmad said that safe drinking or bathing water in megacities can impose serious risks (both acute and delayed) to human health, adding microbe contamination of groundwater due to arsenic-rich levels and high concentrations of poisonous nutrients in sewage waters due to agricultural runoff are among the most serious threats.
With accelerating frequency and intensity and without communities’ policy drafting, severe storms, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts and other extreme weather events are having ever-more evident impacts on human health and wellbeing.
Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning here that recently Secretary of the Ministry of Climate Change (MoCC) & Environmental Coordination Ezaz A. Dar assured the ambassador of the Republic of Azerbaijan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan Khazar Farhadov to extend all-out support for the successful organisation, conduct and negotiations at the two-week long UN-led 29th session of the Conference of the Parties set to kick off from November 11 this year at Baku.

2,PM vows medical access for all,"On World Health Day, premier lauds services of people affiliated with sector","On this year’s World Health Day, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday renewed his government’s commitment to the provision of medical facilities to all of the country’s population.
In his message on the occasion, the premier wrote that this year’s theme of the day – “My health, my right”—“aptly encapsulates every citizen’s right to quality health services”.
“In order to ensure health for all and as promised to the nation in the PML-N manifesto, our focus would remain on improving primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare, medical education, preventive healthcare and improved governance,” he added.
“We will partner and encourage provincial governments to expand and upgrade health facilities, launch mobile health clinics for enhanced access, re-energise immunisation and improve mental health services.”
PM Shehbaz pointed out that the establishment and operationalisation of Medical City, Cancer Care Hospital as well as Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute facilities in each province remained the government’s key priority.
“We take pride in having launched the Health Card during PML-N’s 2013-18 tenure.”
The premier said his government remained committed to universal health coverage and universal health insurance for our population, particularly providing free-of-charge healthcare services to low and middle-income families.
“On this World Health Day, I applaud the services of our health professionals, paramedical staff, nurses, and other health workers who selflessly work day and night to provide health services to the nation. Towards our destination of a healthier nation, I once again reiterate the commitment to transform Pakistan’s healthcare sector at all levels that will ensure that each and every Pakistani has access to quality healthcare.”
Separately, PM Shehbaz has constituted a committee to review climate change governance and mechanisms.
The purpose of forming this body is to access climate funds.
The premier has named Climate Change Minister Romina Khursheed Alam and Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) Executive Director Dr Abid Suleri as its members along with other senior people.
The federal climate change minister has issued a detailed notification explaining the context, mandate, terms of reference (TORs) and list of the members of the committee.
According to the notification, the committee will be chaired by the Planning Commission deputy chairman. It comprises government officials, parliamentarians, representatives from civil society and environment NGOs, private sector, research institutes, and experts with knowledge on specific topics.
The committee will suggest an approach that involves mainstreaming climate considerations across all government organisations and operations, as well as integrating them into the development agenda as well as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
It includes evaluating the effectiveness of existing and proposed institutional mechanisms including the National Climate Change Council, the proposed Climate Change Authority, Climate Change Fund, National Disaster Risk Management Fund, as well as coordination with key ministries.
Additionally, there is a need to review institutional mechanisms and policies to mobilise climate finance.
This includes climate funds and innovative financial instruments.
“The appraisal of institutional mechanisms and policies to mobilise carbon finance is also crucial,” the notification read.
“Furthermore, assessing institutional mechanisms and policies to attract private capital from various sources such as development finance institutions (DFIs), pension funds, insurance companies, commercial banks, venture capital, and private sector firms is essential. Examining institutional mechanisms and policies to enhance engagement with multilateral development banks (MDBs) to reduce the cost of finance and leverage private sector investment through grants, guarantees, and concessional climate funds will also be recommended by the committee,” it added.

3,"Centre, provinces should jointly end terrorism: Bilawal",PPP chief expresses grief over martyrdom of cops in Lakki Marwat,"Expressing his sorrow over the martyrdom of policemen in Lakki Marwat area of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa on late Friday night, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Sunday said the federal and provincial governments should work together to eliminate the bane of terrorism from the country.
“The complete elimination of terrorists and destruction of their nurseries is our national duty. We should all come together [for this purpose],” he added.
The former foreign minister expressed his grief over the martyrdom of DSP Gul Muhammad Khan as well as his two guards Naseem Gul and Salamat Khan in the Lakki Marwat attack.
“The nation is proud of the bravery of DSP Gul Muhammad and other martyrs. Those who sacrifice their lives to eradicate terrorists are our national heroes, he added.”
Apart from the attack on police officials, the PPP chairman’s call for uniting against terrorism has come in the wake of an attack on a Chinese convoy in the Besham town of K-P’s Shangla district.
Six people, including five Chinese engineers, were killed in a suicide attack in Besham on March 26.
An explosive-laden vehicle parked on the roadside blew up when the convoy, transporting Chinese engineers to Dasu Hydropower Project from Islamabad, passed by.
This was the second attack on Chinese workers at the Dasu project.
In July 2021, a similar terrorist attack claimed the lives of 13 people, including nine engineers.
PM Shehbaz Sharif has already directed the interior ministry to increase cooperation with the provinces for the eradication of terrorism from the country.
During a meeting, the premier announced that he would personally review the security arrangements of Chinese nationals.
He directed all the security agencies to take all the measures to ensure fool-proof security of the Chinese citizens present in Pakistan.
“We will continue the war against terrorism until it is eradicated from the country.”
Following the recent attacks, the PM ordered to beef up the security in the country in general and the protection of the Chinese nationals working on different projects across the country in particular.
Even the army chief had reiterated the resolve of the armed forces to eliminate the scourge of terrorism afflicting the country.
Noting the recent surge in terrorist attacks, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir said the enemies of the country had once again underestimated the resilience of the people of Pakistan.
He added that no stone shall be left unturned to ensure that every foreign citizen, especially the Chinese nationals, contributing to the prosperity of Pakistan was safe and secure in the country.

6,APHC condemns recent arrest spree in IIOJK,Says Indian brutalities cannot intimidate Kashmiri people,"The All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) has strongly condemned the fresh spree of raids, crackdowns and arrest unleashed by the Indian forces in every nook and corner of Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) ahead of Indian Lok Sabha election.
According to Kashmir Media Service, APHC spokesman Advocate Abdul Rashid Minhas in a statement issued in Srinagar termed the house raids and arrest of dozens of activists by Indian forces’ personnel in different parts of valley as the worst form of political vengeance to punish the Kashmiris for challenging India’s illegal occupation of their motherland.
He expressed serious concern over the victimisation of common people by the Indian forces’ personnel as well as sleuths of dreaded National Investigation Agency (NIA) and State Investigation Agency (SIA) during cordon and search operations and house raids in Srinagar, Baramulla, Kupwara, Kulgam, Shopian, Pulwama, Bandipora, Islamabad, Poonch, Rajouri, Kishtwar and other districts.
The statement said the Indian brutalities cannot intimidate the Kashmiri people into submission and they will continue their freedom struggle till it reaches its logical conclusion.
The APHC demanded the release of all illegally detained Kashmiri political prisoners languishing in different jails of India and the occupied territory.
Abdul Rashid Minhas also expressed deep concern over the worst violations of human rights by India, including the forced eviction of Kashmiris from their homes and the sale of their lands to non-state residents. Due to such actions, an atmosphere of fear and terror has been established in the entire territory, he lamented.
The statement appealed to the UN Human Rights Council, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other world bodies to send their teams to take stock of the grave human rights situation in the occupied territory.
