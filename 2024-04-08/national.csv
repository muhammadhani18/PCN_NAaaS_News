WRITERS, poets and creative artists are geniuses, but then there goes a famous aphorism that says there is a thin line between genius and madness. Psychologists have always been very keen to discover the connection between creativity and mental disorder.
Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalysis technique, based on study of unconscious mind — also used for the treatment of mental illness — influenced literary criticism as well and gave rise to a school of literary criticism known as psychological criticism. The psychological school of criticism avails itself of Freudian psychoanalysis, surmising that the contents and context of a literary text can be analysed from psychology’s point of view, discovering the childhood influences and unconscious minds of the writers and the characters they create in their literary works.
But psychological criticism is not limited to Freudian literary interpretations and it employs theories other psychologists floated, too, such as, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler and some others. Ernst Jones, a Welsh psychoanalyst, is known for his psychological study of William Shakespeare’s Hamlet, albeit Jones was much impressed by Freud and his analysis too was based on a concept developed by Freud. Jones gave the explanation for Hamlet’s mysterious and baffling behaviour and according to him the inexplicable behaviour was a consequence of Oedipus complex. Dr Asif Farrukhi once analysed Muhammad Husain Azad’s personality and said that Azad was suffering from schizophrenia as he had cooperated with the British, though they had killed his father Moulvi Muhammad Baqar, creating thereby symptoms of a split personality. As we know, Azad wrote some highly imaginative literary pieces but remained almost insane during last 20 years of his life.
In Urdu’s modern day criticism, an important name that is often associated with psychological criticism is Dr Amjad Tufail. In his article Urdu Mein Nafsiyati Tanqeed Ka Jaeza (a survey of psychological criticism in Urdu), he says that the ambit of psychological criticism is quite vast and it takes into account the creation, the creator, the act of creation and impact on the reader while analysing literary works. During the process, it not only considers empirical, historical and descriptive aspects but also different schools of psychology and various theories proffered by different psychologists are taken care of. But, in Urdu, laments Amjad Tufail, only psychoanalysis is stressed while discussing texts from a psychology’s point of view and this only betrays the deficient knowledge on part of some of our critics.
Appreciating Dr Mahmoodul Hasan Rizvi’s critical acumen, Amjad quotes Rizvi who has successfully tried to determine the periphery of psychological criticism: the stages through which a creator passes through during the act of creation; the expression of human psychology in the works created, which can be either individualistic or collective; and the critic’s own psychological stimulus while measuring the literary value of a text.
Discussing some of the critics of Urdu, whose critical works can be termed as psychological criticism, Amjad Tufail names them: Mirza Hadi Ruswa, Abdur Rahman Bijnori, Miraji, Rafiuzzaman Khan, Mazher Aziz, Prof Hizbullah, Waheed Qureshi, Riaz Ahmed, Hasan Askari, Sajjad Baqar Rizvi, Saleem Ahmed, Dr Muhammad Ajmal, Ibn-e-Fareed, Saleem Akhter and some others. In fact, Amjad Tufail himself is also considered one of the critics evaluating literary texts on the basis of psychological theories.
Amjad Tufail, a critic and academic from Lahore, holds a Master’s and a PhD in Psychology and has been teaching the subject and analysing literary works for over 30 years now. But beneath a psychologist’s scientific mind concealed is an artistic soul, deeply involved in finer things, such as literature, philosophy and cultural issues. What sets Amjad Tufail apart is his keenness for social and cultural phenomena as well as psychological notions. When he analyses literary works, his commitment to the society he lives in and its traditions does not waver and he does not mince his words while taking to task those who base their works on some theories negating the very atmosphere they breathe in.
For instance, in his article discussing a book trying to establish that “the human mind cannot be satisfied until the existence of God is finally confirmed with the logical and scientific reasoning”, Amjad Tufail does not bother to cloak his thoughts in less offensive terms and dissects the faulty assumptions presented in a scientific garb. This article, and some others conveying his signature tone, that is, assured and based on logic, is included in his book Ham Asr Urdu Tanqeed (Contemporary Urdu Criticism).
Lahore’s Sang-i-Meel has done a fine job by bringing out five books of Amjad Tufail, all at once. The other four being: Ham Asr Urdu Novel, Ham Asr Urdu Afsana, Ham Asr Urdu Shaeri and Ham Asr Aalmi Adab. The set of books offers a complete picture of Urdu’s contemporary literary scene with its socio-political background and a glance over global literature.

1,JUI-F to sit on opposition benches in Balochistan,Formation of Bugti-led cabinet delayed for another week.,"QUETTA: As the provincial cabinet in Balochistan is yet to take the oath, the JUI-F has decided to sit on opposition benches in the province despite speculations to the contrary.
The party also appointed Younis Aziz Zehri, a lawmaker from Khuzdar, as its leader of the opposition in Balochistan Assembly.
The JUI-F leadership, irked by alleged irregularities in the Feb 8 polls, had decided to stay from the government and instead announced a countrywide protest drive against the election results. The party won 10 seats in the provincial assembly.
In the wake of the Senate elections, it was assumed that the JUI-F would also join the government with its 10 MPAs despite the decision of the JUI-F’s central leadership which did not want to be a part of any government.

Formation of Bugti-led cabinet delayed for another week

These speculations were also fueled by CM Sarfraz Bugti who after meetings with the JUI-F leaders, said the induction of JUI-F MPAs in the cabinet could not be ruled out.
A group of the JUI-F MPAs was also in favour of joining the coalition government but the central
and the provincial leadership, especially provincial chief Maulana Abdul Wasey who lost the Feb 8 election but later became a senator in recent polls, opposed the idea.
The parliamentary meeting of the JUI-F on Sunday seemingly put all these rumours to rest, as it named Nawab Aslam Raisani  opposition leader and the parliamentary party head.
The meeting also discussed the arrangements of the JUI-F public meeting scheduled to be held on April 20 in Pishin.
Cabinet remains elusive
The formation of the provincial cabinet has been delayed for another week despite the CM’s return from abroad. He had gone to visit his brother undergoing a surgery.
Reports had suggested that the cabinet would take oath following his return. However, due to Eid and some other unknown reasons, the cabinet will likely take oath next week.
The spokesman for the Balochistan government also confirmed the delay. “The cabinet is likely to take oath after Eid,” Shahid Rind told Dawn.
He, however, said that the matters regarding the share of the coalition partners in the cabinet had already been settled. Now, the parties only have to choose their candidates for the cabinet.

6,MQM-P lambasts PPP over Sindh law and order failure,"Izhar seeks policing powers for Rangers; home minister dismisses criticism, reposes trust in police","KARACHI: Rising street crimes in the capital of Sindh brought face-to-face allies in the Centre on Sunday when MQM-P censured the PPP-led provincial government and demanded policing powers for Rangers across Sindh.
In a strong rebuke, the PPP accused MQM-P of deliberately undermining police — the primary law enforcement agency — due to “vested political interests.”
Addressing a press conference, senior MQM-P leaders, along with the newly elected legislators of the party, also questioned the recent appointment of Sindh police chief, saying that development “seemingly emboldened criminals, resulting in a surge of criminal activities across the province”.
Last month, the federal government appointed Ghulam Nabi Memon as the inspector general of police for the second time on Sindh government’s recommendation.

Izhar seeks policing powers for Rangers; home minister dismisses criticism, reposes trust in police

The MQM-P leaders presented a “charge sheet” against the PPP government and Sindh police, blaming them for their “failure and incompetence”. They also demanded the federal government intervene in the “larger interest of Karachi and its people.”
The party leaders also expressed anger over the “bandit rule” in rural Sindh, where highways are closed after sunset to keep motorists safe from armed robbers.
“And when the people of Karachi and rural areas are crying over the killing of their loved ones, we witness extremely irresponsible and immature statements of the chief minister and his cabinet members,” said Khawaja Izharul Hasan.
He added the new IG’s appointment was made with “much media fanfare” but it resulted in a “surge of criminal activities across the province”.
“So we strongly believe that the federal government must take decisive action to curb the bloodshed and restore peace in Karachi. And there’s a need for the Rangers to be granted equal powers throughout the province.”
Senator Faisal Subzwari went a step ahead and suggested Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to visit Karachi and question the Sindh chief minister over the law and order situation.
“PPP has been ruling this province for the last 16 years. But in 2024 not a single district of the province is safe. From Karachi to Kashmore, people don’t feel safe,” said Senator Subzwari.
“The situation is same from Kashmore to Karachi. Armed gangs of bandits are ruling rural Sindh, and armed bandits are roaming freely in urban areas without any check.”
Over the past few years, street crimes have become a significant challenge for the Sindh government as more than 250 citizens lost their lives after being shot by street criminals in Karachi between 2022 and March 2024.
Similarly, the law and order situation in riverine areas of upper Sindh has also deteriorated, with armed bandits wantonly looting passengers and kidnapping people for ransom.
The situation is expected to result in a larger fallout, as the MQM-P last week threatened to part ways with the PML-N-led coalition government in the Centre if street crimes were not controlled.
PPP dismisses concerns
The PPP, in its reply to MQM-P’s criticism, claimed its rival party was highlighting the issue as part of a “political agenda”.
“Khawaja Izharul Hassan is presenting himself as a spokesman for [Prime Minister] Shehbaz Sharif,” said Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar in a statement.
“We strongly believe in our police force’s competence and its leadership. We trust our police force,” the minister said and accused the MQM-P of making the force “controversial”.
“This would only help criminals,” warned Mr Lanjar.
He said the IG was personally leading the operation against armed groups in rural areas and was “present in the riverine area of the province right now”.
“All state institutions are playing their part for peace and writ of the state in the province.”
The minister claimed that such criticism has been MQM-P’s “old modus operandi”.
“All is well when they’re in the government but the moment they’re out, they start crying. The people of Sindh have trusted PPP, and the party won from Karachi and elected its mayor. We wouldn’t let down the people of Karachi,” vowed the minister. “Those who’re playing politics on a serious issue would only be disappointed in the end. Restoring peace and harmony is our responsibility, which we will fulfil,” he added.

7,Info minister rebuts Imran’s claims on Toshakhana case,Tarar says a ‘state of panic’ evident from ex-PM’s claims; PTI founder says Ali Zaidi among those in contact with establishment,"KARACHI: Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Sunday rebutted former prime minister Imran Khan’s allegations against the senior military leadership in connection with the Toshakhana case, saying they were “false, fabricated and baseless”, Dawn.com reported on Sunday.
The former premier had alleged that the senior military leadership “implicated” him and his wife Bushra Bibi in the Toshakhana reference “in an attempt to stifle my spirits”.
Responding to his allegations, Mr Tarar said they stemmed “from a  state of panic and despair”. “Totally false, fabricated and baseless  allegations without any proof or evidence,” the minister said in a post  on X.
Mr Khan and his spouse were sentenced to 14 years in jail in the case in January, days before the February 8 general elections.

Tarar says a ‘state of panic’ evident from ex-PM’s claims; PTI founder says Ali Zaidi among those in contact with establishment

Last week, the Islamabad High Court suspended the sentences. However,  appeals against the convictions in the case are still pending.
“[Imran Khan] and his spouse have both been involved in the  Toshakhana heist, audios have proven the level of involvement in  corruption and embezzlement,” the minister asserted.
“Attacks on  state institutions like the one on May 9 and running disrespectful  campaigns against martyrs have been his policy,” he stated, adding that  the “truth cannot be concealed through propaganda and blatant lies”.
The information minister said a “state of panic” at the Adiala jail was evident from Mr Khan’s statements.
Transcript
A post shared on Mr Khan’s official account on X, formerly Twitter, gave  a transcript of his conversation with reporters at Adiala Jail, where  he is currently incarcerated, on Saturday. Mr Khan claimed the senior  military leadership was “driving the state affairs”.
The PTI founder, referring to a “London Plan”, claimed he had relayed a message to the military leadership through then president Arif Alvi that he knew about the so-called plan and that “we are not your enemies”. 
Mr Khan had challenged the army chief last year to prove any corruption case against him and his wife.
Meanwhile, in the transcript of yesterday’s talk with reporters that was  shared on X, Mr Khan also said some PTI leaders were still in contact  with the military establishment. He said former PTI leader Ali Zaidi  “was also in contact”.
Referring to the recent letter by six IHC judges, Mr Khan said, “The judges are revealing that intelligence agency operatives are blatantly threatening them.”
Recalling that Fawad Chaudhry had “denounced PTI”, the former premier claimed he was “still kept in detention in an attempt to force him to become a witness against me”. Mr Fawad was released from the Adiala jail on Friday after he was granted bail by the IHC in a graft case.
“If Parvez Elahi and Shah Mahmood Qureshi hold a press conference today, all charges against them will be dropped,” the PTI founder believed.
‘Begging for talks’
Meanwhile, Punjab PPP leaders Osman Malik, Rana Irfan, Chaudhry Akhtar and Arshad Jutt taunted PTI founder Imran Khan for “begging for talks” with the establishment.  
They said he, who had been bragging “not to spare anyone”, was pleading from jail cell for talks with the establishment. According to them, the PTI has been divided into factions and groups due to provocative policies of its founder.
They demanded that the huge sum of Rs1.2 million being incurred on the security of Imran Khan should be recovered from him instead of overburdening the taxpayers for it.

12,Investigation sought into ‘Waltongate’,Airport operators body laments asset worth Rs350bn sold for Rs50bn only; CAA rejects claim as baseless.,"LAHORE: The Aircraft Owners & Operators Association Pakistan (AOOAP) has called for a probe into the sale of Walton Airport land, claiming that the authorities concerned have flouted rules and regulations in doing so.
“Selling of the land of Walton Airport, Lahore is a perfect case of violation of rules, regulations and proceeds done through deception,” said the association in a letter addressed to the ministry of aviation and defence recently.
On the other hand, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and Punjab Central Business District Development Authority (PCBDDA) have rejected the association’s claim, terming it false and baseless.
According to the authority, it was a government-to-government transaction undertaken by the federal and provincial cabinets in 2021.
For the last few days, apparently since the letter came to the fore, social media is abuzz with the denunciation of the transaction of airport land.

Airport operators body laments asset worth Rs350bn sold for Rs50bn only; CAA rejects claim as baseless

AOOAP General Secretary Muhammad Nawaz Asim, a former captain wing commander, wrote in the latter that the land in question is evaluated to be worth Rs350 billion or more, which has been sold in violation of rules and regulations.
“The worst thing is that out of Rs50 billion (the sold amount), only Rs1 billion has been received into the accounts of CAA. Where is rest of the money gone? Who is the beneficiary and who has been used as rubber stamp to facilitate such corruption?” the letter reads.
It alleges that prima facie the national asset has been destroyed by the land mafias in collusion with the CAA’s director general and other government officials.
“The Waltongate scandal is a symbol of mala fides on part of the CAA officials and that is how aviation industry is being ruined as the Walton Airport was a hub of general aviation in Pakistan which requires judicial intervention and NAB investigation,” it says.
The CAA Officers Association has endorsed the AOOAP’s assertions, demanding the government to launch a thorough probe into the allegations.
A ‘fake story’
Meanwhile, the CAA has rejected the allegations, saying the AOOAP’s letter has concocted a fake and baseless story and that it is a desperate attempt to defame the CAA leadership. The letter aims to undermine the mega central business district project initiated by the Punjab government in Lahore, it added.
“To lend context, there were serious safety concerns regarding continuation of flight operations from Walton Airport. As a result, it was already proposed to the federal government to relocate the training and other operations to a more appropriate location. The decision to move was prompted by the escalating risks posed by aviation activities to the large commercial and residential areas near Walton aerodrome,” the CAA explains.
It recalls that in 2020-21, the then Punjab government had approached the federal government to acquire the land of Walton aerodrome to establish the Lahore central business district.
According to CAA, it was a government-to-government transaction undertaken by both the federal and provincial cabinets in 2021.
The federal government directed the CAA to transfer the land to the PCBDDA. Both the federal and provincial governments approved the project wherein 52 per cent ownership is with the CAA and 48pc with the Punjab government. Besides, the CAA has purchased a piece of land measuring 450 acres in Muridke (Sheikhupura) from the Punjab government to establish a new airport which is near completion.
The PCBDDA has also termed the AOOAP’s letter baseless and misleading and an attempt to “sabotage the repute of CAA for personal gains”.
The PCBDDA states that Pakistan grapples with the repercussions of unplanned city expansion, leading to associated socio-economic challenges. The government’s decision in 2021 marked a pivotal moment as it embarked on integrating high-rise buildings and vertical infrastructure into urban development plans.
It clarifies that Walton Airport’s decommissioning stemmed from its impractical location within densely populated urban areas, posing significant safety risks and hindering sustainable development.
“Consequently, the land was transferred to PCBDDA in a transparent government-to-government (G2G) deal, ensuring accountability and adherence to legal frameworks. The land was transferred through a triparty agreement between CAA, Government of Punjab and PCBDDA on profit sharing model with a three-year grace period.
“Notably, the authority has successfully auctioned 12 mixed-use commercial plots, securing a staggering investment of Rs61 billion,” it said.
