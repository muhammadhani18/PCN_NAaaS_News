0,When Eid becomes frugal,"People forgo their regular shopping patterns for cheaper clothes and accessories in the face of rising inflation, high utility bills, and declining real income.","The skill of Pakistani parents shines through as they attempt to shield their children from the harsh realities of financial strain by ensuring they experience joy this Eid, just like any other.
People are trying to stay steadfast in upholding the tradition of celebrating this happy occasion together, welcoming family and friends, and demonstrating their will to maintain a sense of normalcy and happiness despite challenges.
A quick survey of various markets and interviews with leaders of multiple market bodies in major cities have confirmed that the trend of a shrinking Eid economy not only persisted but intensified this year.
According to marketeers’ responses, a notable trend in 2024 was the significant increase in children’s shopping. Typically, children’s expenses constituted 40 per cent of the total Eid spending, but this year, it was notably higher. Market projections suggested that as much as 50pc of an average Pakistani family’s Eid budget was allocated to fulfilling the needs and desires of children, both boys and girls.

People forgo their regular shopping patterns for cheaper clothes and accessories in the face of rising inflation, high utility bills, and declining real income

The slump hit markets frequented by the middle and upper-middle classes the hardest. Traders lamented that makeshift stalls flooded with copies of brands and cheaper accessories attracted a large percentage of genuine buyers. Meanwhile, they had to contend with the influx of window shoppers, which posed challenges to their businesses.
“Many families enter shops in the market, glance around and then proceed to stalls. With our inventories piling up, we are uncertain how we will manage in such circumstances, especially with rising overheads and utility charges,” Akhtar Shahid, a leader of the Hyderi market in Karachi’s middle-class locality of North Nazimabad, shared nervously.
Atiq Mir, a senior leader of traders, attributed the alarming situation affecting his class to massive declines in real income.
Unlike before, most adult males have switched from custom-made to ready-made clothing. This shift has led to a decline in business for men’s fabric and tailoring, which traditionally thrived during Ramadan.
Feeroz Ahmed, former president of the Cooperative Market Association, confirmed a major setback for fabric sellers and tailoring businesses. “A make-to-order dress costs at least Rs5,000 to Rs6,000, nearly double the price of a typical ready-made shalwar kameez for men. This has compelled even the most particular customers to opt for cheaper options,” he observed.
The search for bargains, which initially begins at malls, is often concluded at cheaper bazaars. “After several visits to markets, it became clear that shopping for the entire family from upscale malls is unaffordable,” remarked a woman shopping for embroidered lawn suits at Gold Mart, a relatively inexpensive marketplace on Korangi Road in Karachi.
“Despite the available saving offers and discounts, Eid shopping remains a challenge. Frequently, we find ourselves checking price tags and abandoning items that caught our interest. If we do make a purchase, it’s not uncommon to experience guilt for exceeding our budget. Even when we adhere to our budget, there’s often a lingering feeling that the item bought is over-priced,” noted a young mother at Dolmen Mall Clifton.
In the mega city, low-end markets outperformed shopping centres like Tariq Road, Hyderi and Clifton. This trend was also noted in other major cities across the country.
Online shopping, which gained momentum over the years, facilitated by the convenience of digital money transfers and especially favoured by the youth, was reported to be less robust than last year for obvious reasons.
Market contractions were not uniform across the city or the country. Predictably, Quetta and other cities in Balochistan seem to have been the worst hit by the current economic downturn.
Badruddin Kakar, a prominent business leader in Quetta, expressed concern, stating, “People crushed by inflation are now burdened with exorbitantly high utility bills. As long as the government prioritises stabilisation over growth, there is limited scope for job creation or salary increases. You can’t expect a vibrant market when pockets are empty.”
Despite its multiple bustling cities, Punjab cannot possibly be immune to the effects of economic slowdown, but it has fared relatively better. Naeem Mir, reached by phone in Lahore, anticipates an improvement in activity in the last week of Ramadan.
Many marketeers believed that Eid spending had hit rock bottom last year and anticipated an upward trajectory moving forward. This year’s experience has proven them wrong, as the Eid market is estimated to have contracted by at least 15pc to Rs368 billion compared to Rs432bn last year.
Upon further breakdown, based on back-of-the-envelope calculations, this translates to an Eid budget of Rs1,600 per person or Rs11,000 per family (assuming the family has six to seven members). This comprehensive budget covers all expenses such as transportation (both inter- and intra-city), clothing, food, Eidi, and any other related expenses.
These numbers are derived from educated estimations, and the projected variations in the market are expressed in percentages. Without any credible source quantifying the peak phase in annual spending in Pakistan, this exercise serves as a reference point, if nothing else.
Despite repeated annual approaches for input, relevant public sector entities such as the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and ministries and departments, like the Federal Ministry of Finance or Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), appear too preoccupied with their own routines to spare time or attention for such exercises which some argue fall beyond their mandate.
When reached by phone in Islamabad, PBS Chief Statistician, Dr Naeem uz Zafar, referred to the Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES), which is conducted every other year to gather data on household income and expenditure and can provide insight into consumption patterns.
“The last HIES was conducted in 2022, and the next one is due this year. We are hoping to start the exercise in July after the budget. However, we do not have current or historical data on festival-specific spending by people,” he remarked.
The SBP’s Chief Spokesperson, Noor Ahmed, confirmed that the bank does not possess data specifically detailing festive spending in the country. “Numbers like bank withdrawals, issuance of fresh notes and total inflow of remittances during Ramazan, which could provide insight into consumer activity trends, are not readily available. We do not track festive spending separately,” Ahmed noted.
Qamar Sarwar Abbasi, the Federal Ministry of Finance spokesperson, mentioned he was not aware of any such study within his ministry but assured him after consulting with colleagues. Meanwhile, Afaq Ahmed Qureshi, spokesperson for the FBR, was approached for comment, but a response was pending at the time of filing the report.

1,Reforming electricity distribution companies,"Eliminating a national uniform tariff while allowing well-managed Discos to move towards privatisation can minimise T&D losses, making electricity more affordable.","The energy value chain cannot be fixed without reforming electricity distribution companies. The inability to fix the chain and make electricity more affordable will continue to keep Pakistan stuck in a low-growth trap while accelerating de-industrialisation. The electricity distribution companies (Discos) are plagued with multiple problems, from governance and pricing to operations.
For any reforms to be successful, the first step needs to be the elimination of a national uniform tariff — which basically penalises efficiency and high repayment propensity while incentivising inefficient processes and low recoveries.
Through a national uniform tariff, well-managed Discos foot the bill for distribution companies with high losses. Disaggregating prices and, consequently, losses will remain critical for any reform. In such a scenario, incentives need to be aligned so that the Discos and respective provinces are motivated or forced to improve efficiencies and recoveries.
The same can only be done by linking financial losses with the National Finance Commission (NFC) award for provinces. As prices are disaggregated, any losses borne by Discos can be borne by the respective province rather than through a collective purse.

Eliminating a national uniform tariff while allowing well-managed Discos to move towards privatisation can minimise T&D losses, making electricity more affordable 

Lower collections and recoveries are largely an administrative problem. As the subsidy is covered by the federation, provincial governments have no incentive to control theft because they do not pay for it directly, but the federation does. Once such subsidies are cascaded down to provinces, which may encroach on the NFC award, necessary incentives will be created to reduce theft and other operational inefficiencies.
Incentives can be structured so that transmission and distribution (T&D) losses exceeding the benchmark stipulated by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority are split between the federal government and respective provincial governments in a 75 per cent to 25pc split, with the federal government share eventually moving to zero over a five-year horizon.
This does not add any upfront burden on the province while also providing sufficient time for reformation and restructuring of the Discos. The provinces can continue to provide subsidies to respective distributors through their respective budgets if required.
It is pertinent to note that the most efficient distribution companies that are located in Punjab and Karachi account for 17pc of electricity units lost, accumulating to Rs26.7 billion for 2022-23. On the flipside, the remaining Discos account for 83pc of electricity units lost, accumulating to Rs133bn for 2022-23.
The same Discos make up 81pc of the total billed amount that could not be recovered, while those located in Punjab and Karachi make up only 19pc of the amount that could not be recovered.
The elimination of a national uniform tariff needs to be accompanied by enabling each distribution company to enter into bilateral agreements with various Independent Power Producers (IPP). This would allow them to slowly move partially away from central power purchasing, thereby relieving the burden of capacity payments.
It is to be noted that there is excess capacity available in the system, which is pooled and priced on a cost-plus basis rather than on the basis of demand and supply. Due to this, even those consumers who are efficient and can increase consumption at an optimal price level are penalised, resulting in lower electricity consumption and higher capacity charges on a per-unit basis.
Allowing Discos to enter into bilateral contracts can lead to better management of available supply and demand. Such structuring will also reduce the capacity available for central purchasing, consequently reducing the liability of capacity payments.
On the governance front, there is a dire need to mix long-term concessions contracts with the private sector and privatisation. Long-term concession contracts make more sense with Discos, which have higher losses and operational inefficiencies. Through these contracts, the provincial government can provide necessary backstops for collecting receivables and reducing theft.
On the other end of the long-term concession, the private party can undertake necessary reforms of the entity while having the provincial government support the collection of receivables. A direct privatisation in such a scenario may not be successful, given the enormous nature of losses and governance problems that lead to those losses.
A privatisation model can be opted for Discos with high recovery levels, which can also be further improved through smart metering and better processes. The government can strive to sell the majority shareholding to a private party, based on whichever party can inject the most capital to catalyse necessary restructuring.
The primary objective at this stage ought to be to reduce T&D losses and make electricity more affordable — the same should drive the decision to privatise or make long-term concessions, depending on governance and administrative constraints.
A path to sustainable economic growth necessitates the availability of affordable electricity, and the same cannot be achieved without the reformation and restructuring of Discos and how electricity is priced in the country. Reforming the market structure by moving towards marginal disaggregated pricing rather than cost-plus pricing remains a core tenet.
If the same market structure and a national uniform price continue, losses will only continue to increase, and so will electricity prices.

2,Who framed the NFC?,The 7th NFC Award has gotten the country to a deficit of Rs6.6tr that might have been slightly larger at Rs7.3tr without it.,"In the case of the perennially broke federal government, the 7th National Finance Commission (NFC) Award has recently become the main suspect. The case against it: the Award short-changed the centre, the provinces squandered their windfall, and the cash-strapped Pakistani government can no longer indulge this bad deal gone worse.
In the global context, this case holds water. An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study set the benchmark for subnational government revenue (tax, non-tax, transfers) at 21 per cent for lower-middle income, federal countries worldwide.
Of course, there is significant variation around this mean. However, the fact remains that the 7th NFC Award’s formula for a 56pc to 44pc split of the federal divisible pool favouring the provinces appears globally exceptional. If we compare this split with the only other federal state in our South Asian neighbourhood, ie India, the 15th Finance Commission recommended a share of 41pc for states in federal taxes for 2021-26.
Moreover, these data points reflect current practice, which is not necessarily the best practice. Fiscal federalism doesn’t offer much in the way of best practice — only foundational principles. For instance, the subsidiary principle holds that public functions should be performed at the level closest to the people whose lives they will affect.

The 7th NFC Award has gotten the country to a deficit of Rs6.6tr that might have been slightly larger at Rs7.3tr without it

This is exactly what the 18th Constitutional Amendment attempted to achieve. A total of 47 subjects were devolved to the provinces. However, less than a third of the functions performed by dissolved ministries actually went to the provinces.
Ministries were resurrected in new and creative ways, and clusters of attached departments/bodies continued metastasising under their hoods. The Ministry of Agriculture, for instance, became the Ministry of Food Security.
Today, the Ministry’s Livestock and Dairy Development Board is working hard to fatten yaks in Gilgit Baltistan. The government didn’t just claw back devolved ministries, it launched vertical programs. Instead of shrinking, federal spending actually increased in devolved domains from 2009-2022, according to the World Bank.
The belt-tightening required by the 7th NFC Award could not happen because the federal government simply wasn’t willing to lose weight.
But this is not the whole problem. The NFC also envisaged a national tax-to-GDP ratio standing at 15pc by the terminal year of the Award, 2014-2015. From 2011-2023, provincial tax revenue growth (9X) dwarfed federal tax revenue growth (3X). Collectively, however, they failed to reach the NFC’s target.
However, suboptimal revenue collection is a historical default. Tax-to-GDP performance has been poor, but it has been consistently poor, pre-and-post 7th NFC Award. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) taxes stood at 9.1pc of the GDP in FY11 which charts as a flat line to 8.5pc of the GDP in FY23. Over the same period, provincial taxes barely moved from 0.4pc to 0.8pc of the GDP.
While the lack of growth is unfortunate, it does not fully explain the present crisis. What has changed over the past two decades? Where does the federal fiscal pressure originate? Who has framed the 7th NFC Award, and what if it didn’t exist?
Suppose we remove it from the equation and develop an alternate fiscal picture for FY23. If we derive compounded growth rates from a 10-year period prior from FY01 to FY10 for federal revenue and expenditure and then project them forward until FY23, what do we get?
This is obviously an oversimplified thought experiment, not a sophisticated economic analysis. But how does this hypothetical position compare with the actual position for 22 years under the 7th NFC?
Well, the government’s net federal receipts would be one-third larger in the ‘no-NFC’ scenario — obvious given the smaller provincial share. We’d also be spending about one-fifth more in federal expenditures — again, no surprises. The more we have, the more we’re likely to spend.
However, the real difference between the ‘no-NFC 2023’ and the ‘actual 2023’ fiscal position would be the federal expenditure exclusive of markup payments. When we remove debt servicing costs, the federal government’s expenditure drops off a cliff in the actual 2023 position compared to the hypothetical 2023 position.
This means the real culprit was right under our noses all along — debt. Interest payments have risen an eye-watering 716pc from FY11 to FY23, growing from 28pc of federal expenditure to 50pc. The jump from FY22 to FY23 may be a blip, but historically, it is still trending skyward, and as the State Bank has warned, we should not bet on a correction in FY24.
The July-December 2023 data certainly supports this pessimism. The irony is that, in terms of overall budget balance, there is not much difference between actual and hypothetical 2023. With the NFC, we have a deficit of some Rs6.6 trillion (7.8pc of the GDP)—without it, we might have had a slightly larger one at Rs7.3tr (8.6pc of the GDP).
The federal government chose a debt feast over an NFC diet. It turns out it’s not about the size of the cake or how it was sliced. The real problem is that the government has been eating cake bought on store credit for over two decades, and the bill has finally come due.

3,Economy waiting for a push,"Around 10m employable people are jobless, and the number may rise in the coming months even if the recessionary trend is reversed.","Some 40 per cent of Pakistanis continue to live below the poverty line with little in sight to hope for better days. The country’s economic growth of 2.5pc recorded in July-September 2023 faltered to just 1pc in the next quarter. Overall growth in the current fiscal year (July 2023-June 2024) may hardly hit the 2pc mark amid persisting political instability, deteriorating security environment, rising energy prices and forex crisis.
The World Bank’s latest forecast says Pakistan’s GDP may grow only by 1.8pc-2.5pc in the next fiscal year starting from July. Meanwhile, around 10 million employable people are still jobless, and the number may rise in the coming months even if the recessionary trend seen in industrial output during the first seven months of the fiscal year is reversed.
At best, the output of large-scale manufacturing (LSM) for a full year may rise to 1.8pc, according to the World Bank estimates. LSM production rather declined by 0.5pc on a year-on-year basis in seven months.
An estimated 1.8pc growth in LSM is too small to affect joblessness, particularly because in the current economic environment of ever-rising energy prices, high-interest rates and import controls, even this much growth is only possible if industries become more efficient and cut production costs — which, in the case of labour-intensive industries like textiles and food, means ‘right sizing’ their employees.

Around 10m employable people are jobless, and the number may rise in the coming months even if the recessionary trend is reversed

An estimated 35pc shortage in water availability (caused primarily by climate change) for Kharif crops also threatens the output of the labour-intensive agriculture sector, which has driven overall GDP growth with its sectoral output expansion of 8pc and 5pc, respectively, in the first and second quarters of FY24.
Although consumer inflation slowed in February and March this year, average inflation during nine months FY24 (July-March) was still high at 27.1pc — almost unchanged from 27.3pc recorded a year ago in the same period. This shows how entrenched inflationary pressures have become and explains why the State Bank of Pakistan is unwilling to ease its tight monetary policy.
The recent increase in the prices of petrol and other petroleum products (effective April 1), the government’s decision to jack up electricity prices once again under the head of the fuel adjustment surcharge, and the expected delayed effect of the increase in gas prices from February may continue to fuel inflationary pressures in April-June, the last quarter of FY24.
This is exactly why the World Bank, in its recent economic update, says that full-year average inflation in Pakistan may be around 26pc.
Inflationary pressures will become more pronounced if the security situation in the Middle East worsens any further and Iran is dragged into the Hamas-Israel war after an attack on its embassy in Damascus last week allegedly carried out by Israel.
In this case, not only will the landed cost of imported fuel oil rise, but imports of other items, including industrial raw materials, may also become costlier due to related supply chain disruptions.
So far, import controls have helped Pakistan keep its rupee from depreciating despite obvious forex shortages. But what if the country pays more foreign exchange for the same volume of imports it currently allows? That would not only let more imported inflation creep into national consumer inflation but also make it more difficult to maintain exchange rates at the current levels.
The last tranche of $1.1 billion out of a $3bn short-term International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan is expected to come in shortly. It will help keep the exchange rates somewhat stable for a few weeks without taking a major hit on already low central bank foreign exchange reserves.
But, as the external financing gap for the next fiscal year (July 2024-June 2025) has been estimated around $24bn, nothing less than a fast-tracked large IMF loan — around $8bn-$9bn — topped with some climate change funding can help Pakistan move forward on the external account.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said he would not waste time in approaching the Fund for a large, long-term loan. The Ministry of Finance has begun the spadework for this purpose. However, two important things to watch for are when exactly this new loan will be approved by the IMF and when Pakistan can draw its first tranche.
Inflows of foreign investment and additional forex funding by friendly countries — two important elements of the new government’s strategy to tackle balance of payments problems — remain dependent on the IMF’s new loan. Any delay in securing IMF funding would be simply unmanageable.
The current trend of rising foreign investment in Pakistan’s debt instruments is nothing but the re-arrival of “hot money” the nation has seen multiple times before — most recently during the PTI era.
This hot money is coming in as our treasury bills pay a very attractive return of about 21pc, and foreigners who buy them through a rupee-dollar dual bank account are allowed to convert the returns earned in rupees smoothly into foreign currencies and repatriate them easily back home.
Exports are doing reasonably well in a challenging environment and registered 9pc year-on-year growth in the nine months of FY24. Still, the goods trade deficit stood at $17bn during this period, which is equal to more than 74pc of the export earnings ($22.9bn).
Unless the volume of the trade deficit is brought down to half the export earnings and sustained at this level, the temporary relief we have seen in our current account deficits (mainly due to import bill contraction) will be over.
One thing is certain: this time, when the IMF offers a larger and longer-term loan, it will demand real liberalisation of imports — a demand it made in the past but showed flexibility. What will happen then?

4,Policy-driven rent-seeking,Current monetary policy benefits the wealthy while exacerbating economic inequality due to rising cost-push inflation.," 


Rent-seeking refers to exploiting an economic environment to extract undue premiums without contributing to productivity, innovation, or value creation for the wider economy.
In Pakistan, governments, whether political or autocratic, have historically implemented economic policies, including monetary policy adjustments, tariff protections, tax incentives, and subsidies, to integrate underperforming sectors with mainstream economic development.
However, most of the time, these policies end up helping people who are already rich, leading to situations where people try to secretly enjoy benefits that weren’t meant for them, helped along by each new government since independence.
This analysis begins with monetary policy in Pakistan, which has been characterised by a policy rate of 22 per cent since last year. This high policy rate poses a significant challenge for startups, small and medium-sized enterprises, and other growing firms in securing financing.

Current monetary policy benefits the wealthy while exacerbating economic inequality due to rising cost-push inflation

The backdrop of high cost-push inflation has reduced firms’ profit margins, complicating their ability to expand operations. The annual percentage rates for microcredit range from 25pc to 35pc, with conventional banks offering similar rates, thereby exacerbating the difficulty of obtaining affordable loans.
Moreover, the Pakistani economy urgently needs to boost exports to maintain a balanced foreign trade. However, the high cost of financing, whether through debt or equity, surpasses the real rate of return, hindering the enhancement of local production. This scenario has led investors to prefer depositing their funds in savings accounts, which offer a risk-free return exceeding the real market return.
Consequently, this preference not only undermines the business ecosystem, acting as a barrier to growth but also escalates the state’s debt servicing costs, given that 87pc of bank deposits are loaned to the state.
Intriguingly, state-owned enterprises deposit more than Rs6 trillion of the Rs23tr in bank deposits, receiving lower returns while the state incurs higher borrowing costs. This results in the state earning a lower premium on one hand and bearing elevated debt expenses on the other.
Because of the prevailing monetary policy, banks have inadvertently become the primary beneficiaries, realising significant billion-dollar profits from the interest rate spread. This outcome, while advantageous for banks, further complicates the economic landscape.
Monetary policy’s intended objective is to regulate the money supply and curb inflation. However, this policy has inadvertently increased cost-push inflation and exacerbated economic inequality.
This situation aligns with Thomas Piketty’s analysis, which posits that inequality intensifies when the rate of return on capital outpaces economic growth. The result is capital income growing more rapidly than wages and output, thereby concentrating wealth among the already affluent and amplifying the disparities between those less so, thereby challenging the fundamental goals of monetary policy.
Regarding fiscal policy, Pakistan has pursued a path towards trade liberalisation since its accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1995. Import tariffs, which averaged 54.7pc during 1990-1999, were reduced to approximately 30pc by 2001 and further declined to an average of 10pc to 12pc by 2019. Despite these significant tariff reductions, Pakistan’s economy continues to be notably protected due to a selective liberalisation strategy.
A study conducted by Research for Social Transformation & Advancement at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics points out that the 2013 International Monetary Fund programme, which was adopted by a government closely associated with powerful business interests, sought to implement trade reforms through the simplification of tariffs and the elimination of exemptions.
However, this initiative inadvertently provided advantages to sectors with strong political ties — special interest groups — thereby highlighting the intricacies of Pakistan’s trade protection framework.
Between 1996 and 2021, certain groups gained increased trade protection regardless of whether the government was democratic or authoritarian. This trend is consistent with patterns seen in other developing countries, where, contrary to expectations, trade liberalisation has actually increased the advantages these groups receive.
Specifically, while the overall average tariff is 12pc, the tariff on consumer goods is significantly higher at 35.4pc, positioning Pakistan as having the second-highest tariff in this category globally, after Egypt, at 57.7pc.
The introduction of alternative trade protection mechanisms, including various import duties and non-tariff measures, has counterbalanced the decrease in tariffs. Notably, regulatory and additional customs duties were introduced in 2008, with notable increases in 2013 and a subsequent moderate rise in 2016.
Distinct from tariffs, which necessitate parliamentary consent, these duties merely require the federal cabinet’s approval. Initially introduced to address current account deficits through import restriction and generate revenue, they are enacted through Statutory Regulatory Orders (STOs).
These STOs permit specific exemptions and further complicate the trade protection landscape for these special groups. These groups received substantial subsidies exceeding Rs1.3tr last year, while the deficit surpassed 6pc of GDP.
In the real estate sector, over 90pc of agricultural land is exempt from taxation, and numerous tax exemptions are available for real estate developments. Tax exemptions and concessions were accessible to developers and builders who met specific criteria, including selling at least 50pc of plots and finalising sales for a minimum of 40pc of plots, houses, or flats.
Furthermore, participants in amnesty schemes were not required to disclose their income sources and received substantial tax benefits worth billions of rupees.
The sole strategy for revitalising the economy, fostering a healthy business environment, and reducing deficits involves the Pakistani state reducing its economic footprint, phasing out subsidies, and liberalising the economy. This approach will allow the market to autonomously develop its ecosystem, enhancing production, decreasing imports, and curbing inflation domestically.

5,Tone-deaf policies and changing cropping patterns,Policies to encourage specific crops while disregarding critical factors are ineffective as farmers shift towards their preferred options.,"Pakistan’s agriculture sector is witnessing a notable change in cropping patterns, driven by a complex interplay of various factors, including climate change and evolving market dynamics. However, it is concerning that the change appears to be out of sync with government planning and future development objectives set by our policymakers.
The changing cropping patterns raise a pertinent policy issue: how can Pakistan’s overall agricultural productivity be increased through the right selection of crops? What and how much should be grown, and why?
According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, agricultural statistics spanning 2012 to 2022 reveal that the wheat crop area has seen a moderate increase from 8.7 million to 8.9m hectares — a rise of 3.8 per cent. Notably, over the said ten-year period, rice, maize (corn), and sugarcane crop areas have surged by 37pc, 52pc, and 19pc respectively.
However, this increase occurred primarily at the expense of cotton, which plummeted from 2.8m to 1.9m hectares during the same period, reflecting a staggering 32pc decrease.

Policies to encourage specific crops while disregarding critical factors are ineffective as farmers shift towards their preferred options

Not only has the cultivation of much-cherished cotton experienced a decline, but the combined areas of major edible oil seeds (sunflower, canola, rapeseed, and mustard), as well as pulses (gram, mung, mash, and lentil), have also experienced a shrinking trend, with negative growths of 31pc and 1.5pc respectively over 2012-2022 period. Regrettably, the provisional figure of the area of pulses planted in 2022-2023, according to the Pakistan Economic Survey, indicates a further decline of 9.9pc within a mere year.
The statistics unmistakably highlight the significant trend of crop switching. However, these trends stand in stark contrast to the government’s policies and initiatives to expand domestic production of cotton, edible oil seeds, and pulses to alleviate the burden of increasing imports.
In their endeavours to promote these crops, which are essential for the country’s economic development and food security, policymakers and sector experts have overlooked the intricate interplay of various dynamic factors at the grassroots level.
In Pakistan, where crop zoning is neither practised nor mandatory, the key factors influencing crop choice include agroclimatic conditions, availability of irrigation water, mechanisation intensity, labour requirements, ease of farming operations, availability and cost of crop inputs, production and price risks, and marketability of produce.
However, as we transition from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture, the primary motivator for farmers remains the financial returns derived from specific crops.
Undoubtedly, any government policy or initiative aimed at promoting a specific crop will fail if it disregards these critical factors. However, the government may achieve its objectives by offering significant subsidies or other incentives to compensate for any weak or missing links in the overall equation. Nonetheless, the long-term sustainability of such interventions, which may lead to market distortion, remains a question mark.
To support this argument, we can reference the success stories of maize and sesame cultivation in Pakistan. Over recent years, both crops have experienced significant growth in crop area and production — maize production expanded by 55pc, while sesame production soared by an impressive 275pc from 2017 to 2022.
Likewise, their exports have witnessed remarkable growth. From July to December in the current fiscal year alone, Pakistan exported maize and sesame seeds worth $262m and $364m, indicating an impressive growth of 208pc and 278pc, respectively. Pakistan has now emerged as the fifth-largest exporter of sesame seeds globally and the second-largest supplier of China after Niger.
Interestingly, this growth has largely occurred without any notable government support. In truth, the success of maize and sesame can be attributed to favourable climate conditions, improved seed varieties and advantageous market dynamics, such as the appreciation of the dollar against the rupee (from 104 to 275 over a seven-year period), resulting in better market prices, and in turn, greater profits for farmers.
Given that no mechanism exists to regulate crop acreage in the country, farmers will continue growing their preferred crops unless their profitability is significantly undermined by a decline in yield or crop prices or until a new crop with better prospects emerges as a viable alternative.
Such a shift is exemplified by the case of sugarcane, which has replaced a substantial acreage of cotton in South Punjab over the last two decades. Similarly, farmers are replacing the mung bean area — adversely affected by extreme weather conditions — with sesame, which offers higher profit and lower production costs.
In addition, farmers today are more resourceful (though not all) and better informed than ever before. They promptly respond to market changes or new limiting factors in the very next crop season without requiring much time for adoption.
For instance, Punjab’s farmers are currently adjusting to the decline in maize prices observed in 2023 by reducing the area planted with maize in 2024, as evidenced by the recent sales figures of maize hybrid seed.
Put simply, while the government’s historical emphasis on promoting cotton and edible oil seeds — strictly in line with the principle of comparative advantage, the domestic resource cost concept, and the theory of factor endowments — made sense in the past, it may no longer hold the same relevance in today’s agricultural landscape, characterised by climate variability, higher production and price risks, technological advancements, variety of substitute crops, and evolving market dynamics.
If we set aside environmental considerations (depletion of water resources), the current agricultural landscape appears to favour crops such as maize, rice, sugarcane, wheat, potato and sesame over cotton, pulses, and major edible oil seeds.
However, in the future, the emergence of high-yielding, climate- and insect-resistant varieties of cotton or other crops, along with favourable produce prices, could fundamentally alter the entire balance in their favour because these crops are substitutes for each other.
In conclusion, it is high time for our policymakers to acknowledge the evolving agricultural landscape and prioritise crops that can increase Pakistan’s overall agricultural productivity and the welfare of farmers. The sooner policymakers recognise this reality, the better prepared they will be to steer Pakistan’s agricultural development towards effective and sustainable outcomes.

8,Stagnant contraceptive use,"Other forms of birth control, such as internal uterine devices and injectables, have shown similarly marginal growth as well.","


 
Nisreen weeps after her toddler daughter dies, but the tears are few. This was her second girl to die, primarily from neglect — and she has six more at home. Her last pregnancy was spent in constant prayer to finally give birth to the boy her husband so desperately desires. Running the house from the meagre earnings of a maid, she has little time or money to care for her numerous daughters who often roam the streets with no food in their bellies, no slippers on their feet, and sometimes, missing a shalwar or a kameez owing to abject poverty.  
Despite a growing population, the growth in the use of contraceptives has become stagnant. This is an extremely alarming situation as no amount of bailouts can indefinitely support the roughly six million babies birthed in the country every year. Other forms of birth control, such as internal uterine devices and injectables, have shown similarly marginal growth as well.
The traditional thinking of the superiority of sons over daughters is still dominant in many sections of society, and then there is the social stigma of social planning disguised as religious tenants. Yet, beyond accusations of manipulation, last year’s census sparked no drive that could stem the growth in population, hence preventing more tragedies like Nisreen’s.

10,Redefining priority sectors,The finance minister aims to accelerate growth by concentrating investments on redefined growth-enabling sectors while exploring financing options apart from banks.,"The federal government has prioritised sectors such as agriculture, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and information technology (IT) for bank financing to stimulate growth.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has requested the Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA) to lead a task force comprising representatives from the banking sector, government and relevant stakeholders. The primary objective is to accelerate financing for the priority sectors.
He advised the PBA to devise actionable strategies to overcome the existing challenges and bottlenecks hindering the growth of these vital sectors.
At the same time, the federation seeks reduced reliance on bank financing and is focusing on developing equity and debt markets to fund infrastructure projects through public-private partnerships.

The finance minister aims to accelerate growth by concentrating investments on redefined growth-enabling sectors while exploring financing options apart from banks

“There has been a massive redistribution of wealth from the public to the financial sector due to government borrowings and high-interest rates,” says Yousuf Nazar, the former head of Citigroup’s emerging markets investment and author of The Gathering Storm.
In a related development, a proposal was recently initiated for co-financing federal ‘strategic projects’ by the centre and the provinces, along with integrating provincial projects to create synergy among the provinces.
On previous occasions, sub-federations opposed efforts by the PML-N and PTI governments to seek provincial finances for federal projects. “Any such move,” says a PPP leader, “would require necessary legislation”.
Supporting the finance minister’s initiative, State Bank of Pakistan Governor Jamil Ahmed has reiterated the central bank’s commitment to facilitating an environment that will allow banks to increase lending to priority sectors.

Centralised economic planning is not mentioned in the constitution, which only mentions provincial economic coordination under the National Economic Council

As the interest rate has turned positive by 1.3 per cent — with inflation reading at 20.7pc in March falling below the policy rate of 22pc — financial markets expect the central bank to cut rates. However, the trade deficit has widened simultaneously by 56pc to $2.2 billion.
Unstable security and exchange rates, as well as high inflation, are major concerns for operational Japanese companies in expanding their business in Pakistan, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation.
Moreover, under the National Development Framework (NDF) draft being finalised, the Planning Commission will define “strategic priorities by declaring certain sectors to be growth-enablers, such as infrastructure, and focus only on investment in these sectors while, at the same time, rendering provinces autonomy to define their provincial development priorities”.
Towards that end, a national development outlay may be prepared, comprising the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) and provincial Annual Development Plans (ADP), which highlight the main sectoral strategies and priorities as well as flagship projects.
However, to quote Barrister Zamir Ghumro, “The federation has no role in central planning with regard to the economy”. Mr Ghumro, a former advocate general of Sindh, points out that centralised economic planning is not mentioned in the constitution. The constitution only mentions provincial economic coordination under the National Economic Council.
During the first quarter of this fiscal year, the provincial current expenditure increased by 57pc while development spending increased by 61pc.
The NDF draft proposes that provinces can find financial support from international donors and through provincial resources to support their development priorities. This stands out in sharp contrast with the government policy to reduce the foreign debt burden.
No doubt, prioritising sectors like agriculture, SMEs, and IT will help stimulate balanced growth if the evolved strategies are sound and effectively implemented.
According to a Food and Agriculture Organisation study, the current understanding is that farmers are individuals who own the land they work on. Landless peasants are excluded from policymaking to increase farm productivity.
To quote agricultural experts, a relatively neglected area that has not so far received the required focus is the human factor — poor knowledge, training, and efficiency of our farm workers, who carry out day-to-day operations on agricultural lands.
Now more than ever, they stress that Pakistan needs a paradigm shift towards improving workforce skills if we want a more productive, competitive and sustainable agriculture sector.
Moreover, the move to step up corporate farming — a progressive step to modernise agriculture — has revived the issue of allotting state lands to landless peasants.
Leaders of the Sindh Hari Tehreek (SHT) have strongly opposed handing over around 1.3 million acres of Sindh’s land for corporate farming earmarked for foreign and domestic investors. Instead, farmlands should be allotted to landless peasants, one resolution at a recent conference organised by the SHT demanded.
While lands used for corporate farming would indeed generate income, water availability is a serious issue in the present conditions, says PPP Sindh President Nisar Ahmed Khuhro. He emphasised that anyone’s share should not be cut.
The SHT conference also demanded that steps be taken to ensure water availability to lower riparian regions and the immediate dismantling of all illegal watercourses laid by influential landowners, ministers, and official advisors.
In its April 2 report, the World Bank warned that Pakistan’s nascent recovery was neither sustainable nor sufficient to address the country’s increasing poverty, currently 40pc. It expects the economy to grow at 1.8pc this fiscal year.

11,CORPORATE WINDOW; Food preservation via solar drying,"Vast amounts of produce are wasted because they do not meet appearance, size, and colour standards that may be preserved using solar-drying technologies.","


 
“Pakistan is a country with a substantial agricultural sector that plays a vital role in feeding its population and exporting food to other countries. However, despite its significant contribution to the world’s food supply, Pakistan still faces challenges in ensuring food security for its citizens,” said Dr Muhammad Hanif, a senior scientific officer at the National Agriculture Research Centre, while talking to WealthPK. 
Pakistan’s struggle to secure its food supply is due to insufficient food storage capacity. Shockingly, a significant portion, ranging from 10 per cent to an alarming 50pc of the total food production in Pakistan, goes to waste, Dr Hanif added. 
As the Ministry of National Food Security & Research reported, a staggering 26pc of food, or 19.6 million metric tons worth $4 billion, is wasted annually in Pakistan. 
In Sindh’s urban markets, vegetable and fruit prices exhibit a consistent pattern. Prices for fresh produce are highest in the morning and gradually decrease throughout the day as sellers aim to clear their stock to avoid spoilage due to limited storage facilities. 

Vast amounts of produce are wasted because they do not meet appearance, size, and colour standards that may be preserved using solar-drying technologies

Similarly, prices are low at the beginning of each harvesting season due to abundant supply, but as the season progresses and preservation options are lacking, prices soar. Improved preservation methods could mitigate this issue by enabling storage and utilisation of surplus produce, thus helping to stabilise prices. 
Meanwhile, Dr Muhammad Siddique Depar, the Principal Scientific Officer at the Arid Zone Research Centre (AZRC) Umerkot, unveils a paradigm shift in chilli processing. He stated that chillies traditionally require two weeks of outdoor air-drying. 
“Over the past three years or so, AZRC has installed a red chilli drying machine donated by a foreign country, a solar tunnel, and a chilli dehydrator drying and washing machine. “This has significantly reduced drying time to four days in a solar tunnel or 30 hours with the dryer, compared to the traditional two-week outdoor drying process,” Dr Depar explained.
Farmer Javed Rajar also discussed chilli drying, saying, “I availed the AZRC red chilli drying facilities, and it saved me time and quality. However, I am still dependent on traditional methods as AZRC did not have the capacity to dry all my chilli crops. For large-scale production, these machines are not enough,” he lamented. 
Certainly, these machines rely on external electrical power for operation, incurring additional costs. Moreover, their limited capacity makes them costlier when considering the need for additional dryers to process larger crops. 
In light of these complexities, Mehmood Nawaz Shah, President of the Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB), sheds light on a broader agricultural dilemma. “Pakistan is ranked sixth or seventh in producing dates in the world, but we have poor infrastructure and lack modern machinery and techniques, which is why we suffer big losses,” he said. 
A large number of dates are spoiled annually in our country. In a reported case during the 2022 monsoon, about 80pc of the date crop in Sindh suffered damage, resulting in multimillion-rupee losses for palm growers. 
Why not shift towards the technology that is both cost-effective and efficient, utilising readily available and abundant natural resources — in this case solar energy — in our region?
Maharashtra India’s Vaibhav Tidke, a farmer’s son, founded “Scien­ce4Society (S4S) Tech­nologies”, capitalising on the abundant solar energy in tropical regions when cold storage is unavailable for preserving food products. Founded in 2008, S42 is now being used in about ten countries. 
A renowned global initiative, “Energising Development (EnDev)”, dedicated to expanding energy access globally, recently launched a pioneering project in Peru aimed at processing coffee beans using solar dryers. This reduces bean humidity to 25pc by filtering ultra-violet radiation, concentrating heat, and improving ventilation. 
Innovations like these can not only help reduce food wastage but can also provide employment opportunities. 
Key manufacturers in the solar-powered agricultural dryer sector are investing in research and development to drive product innovation, enhance production methods, and expand into new international markets. Notable companies include GrainPro, Rudra Solar Energy, S4S Technologies, Solarflex, and JUA Technologies. 
Consequently, integrating these solar drying technologies in Pakistan can crucially align with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG-2 (Zero Hunger), SDG-7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG-8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). Since all 17 SDGs are interconnected, success in one affects success in others.
The agricultural landscape in Pakistan stands at the cusp of a transformative shift with solar food drying innovations driven by the need for food security. Primarily, solar dryers operate with a one-time capital cost, with a payback period of six months to 1.5 years covering installation expenses, with no ongoing running costs. 
Looking ahead, the prospect of introducing solar drying technologies on a larger scale holds immense promise for the agricultural sector. It is a testament to the nation’s commitment to innovation, sustainable practices, and a journey towards more efficient food production. Through continued collaboration and investment in such technologies, Pakistan can pave the way for a brighter, more sustainable future in agriculture.

12,Data points,"As the US begins to transition away from fossil fuels, innovators in the energy space are looking at social, economic, and health","Need for social justice
As the US begins to transition away from fossil fuels, innovators in the energy space are looking at social, economic, and health issues through the lens of racial and social justice. And they’re acknowledging that communities of colour often bear the brunt of those issues, like higher utility bills and increased vulnerability to natural disasters. This connection is giving rise to the growing field of energy justice, according to Shalanda Baker, director of the Office of Economic Impact and Diversity at the US Department of Energy. Energy justice specifically focuses on the ways communities should have a say in shaping their energy futures through policy involvement and ensuring that policies that are being developed during this period of energy transition don’t have unequal impacts on the most marginalised communities. Climate issues are pressing and need to be solved soon, she said, but in the rush to solve problems, we can’t overlook social justice.

Toll of micro-stresses
Micro-stresses are small moments of stress that seem manageable on their own — think a vague, worrying text from your teen flashing on your phone while you’re in a meeting, the appearance of a colleague who always wants to vent to you, or having to tell your team that the project you’ve all been grinding out extra hours on is no longer a priority. But these micro-stresses aren’t as harmless as they seem. Because they’re so small and brief, they don’t trigger the normal stress response in our brains to help us cope; instead, micro-stress embeds itself in our minds and accrues over time. The long-term impact of this buildup is debilitating: It saps our energy, damages our physical and emotional health, and contributes to a decline in our overall well-being. But once you understand the science behind micro-stress and where it comes from, you can fight back. Finding ways to eliminate even just a few micro-stresses in your life can make a significant difference.

Returning to former employer
Whether it’s due to a change in personal circumstances, a misalignment with your new role, or a realisation that your last job was a better fit, it’s not uncommon to want to return to a former employer. But the decision — and the negotiation — to get back to an old job requires a balance of head and heart. Here are some tips to help you navigate the situation. 1) Think about why you want to return. Ask yourself: Why did I leave in the first place and why do I want to go back? 2) Do some research. Look into the financial state of your previous organisation and the industry to better understand if they may be open to hiring. 3) Ask for a meeting. Reach out to your previous manager or someone in HR to express your interest in rejoining the company. 4) Try and win their trust. If they agree to meet, try to show sincerity, transparency, care, and integrity.

The $100 bill
The $100 bill dwarfs even the $1 bill as the most common US paper currency. The number of bills bearing Benjamin Franklin’s mug more than doubled between 2012 and 2022, faster growth than any other denomination, according to the most recent Federal Reserve data. One reason they have become so prevalent is that they enter circulation far quicker than they leave. They can last over a decade longer than $1s and $5s, partly because people are more likely to hold than spend them. While more than half of $100s are held abroad, there were enough in the US for every living American to have 55 in 2022, according to calculations by Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University. For all its prevalence, the $100 bill is more effective for storing money than spending it. Even when cashiers do accept the bills, they hold up checkout lines to verify they aren’t counterfeits.
