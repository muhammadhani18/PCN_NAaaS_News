At the Paris Olympics this summer, eight-time world champion Janja Garnbret is looking to win another gold medal, just like she did in Tokyo in 2021 when the sport made its debut in the Games.
“Once you have an Olympic medal, you want another one,” the 25-year-old Slove­nian spiderwo­man told AFP in an interview between training sessions in Japan and China.
While in Slovenia, Garn­bret spends most of her time in a tucked-away climbing gym near Vrhnika, some 20 kilometres south of Ljubljana.
Despite her success — an illustrated children’s book about her life should be out later this year — Garnbret keeps her feet firmly on the ground.
She believes she is bles­s­ed to be able to do what she has liked most since she was seven.
“When I’m competing, I feel like nothing else matters,” she said. “I don’t hear the crowd... It’s just me in my own world, my own bubble... My mind is clear.
“I don’t have any thou­ghts. I climb by intuition.”
Garnbret’s parents discovered her talent during one of their many attempts to keep their  “hyper-active” daughter busy.
During one excursion, they came upon a five- or six-metre high promotion clim­b­ing wall, which made Janja stop and  “stare at it, tempted”.
Once secured to ropes,  “she just climbed to the top”, her father, Vili Garn­bret, proudly remembers.
She then joined a local climbing club near their home and eventually stop­ped her other hobby of dan­ce classes to focus on climbing.
“I personally wasn’t so exc­ited about her decision, but I accepted it,” her mot­her, Darja Garnbret, recalls, adding they fully supported their daughter even though they initially  “did not know about this sport”.
Garnbret herself beli­eves her first climbing steps happened much earlier, when she was  “climbing doors, clo­sets and trees as a little girl”.
“One of the first feelings I remember when climbing was how strong and light at the same time I felt on the wall... And this is still the feeling I’m looking forward [to] the most every time I go climbing,” she said.
She adds in climbing she  “fou­­nd that spark, that fire in me”.
One of her first coaches, Rok Malek, said Garnbret only took three or four months to outperform colleagues who had been training for two years or more.
“Her talent was exceptional. She moved intuitively,” he told AFP.
Her current coach Rom­an Krajnik also remembers being impressed when he first saw her at a national competition.
“She’s definitely made for this sport,” Krajnik said, lauding her tough training regimen — with just one day off after three days of training — while deeming her already  “ready” for the Paris Olympics.
Garnbret will compete in the lead and bouldering discipline — that was split off from speed climbing — from Aug 5 to 10.
“Even though she has achieved pretty much everything she could achieve, she’s still prepared to train like she never achieved anything before,” Krajnik said.

1,Shadow PSG  side held in final warm-up for Barca showdown,PARIS: Paris St Germain warmed up for their looming Champions League showdown with Barcelona by fielding a shadow...,"PARIS: Paris St Germain warmed up for their looming Champions League showdown with Barcelona by fielding a shadow line-up in a 1-1 draw at home to struggling Clermont on Saturday.
PSG needed a Goncalo Ramos equaliser with five minutes left, following a one-two with substitute Kylian Mbappe, to snatch a draw and avoid what would have been just a second loss in Ligue 1 this season.
Malian midfielder Habib Keita had earlier given bottom side Clermont the lead in the first half, but they could not hold on for a repeat of their win in Paris last season.
It was a slightly farcical goal, with Milan Skriniar making a hash of a clearance and Tenas not coming for a cross before Alan Virginius set up Keita to prod in.
Mayulu thought he had equalised with a superb strike in first-half injury time, only for a VAR intervention to rule the goal out for a foul in the build-up by Zague.
Achraf Hakimi, who will be suspended in the first leg against Barcelona and came on for the injured Mukiele, hit the bar early in the second half as PSG pushed for a leveller.
Mbappe came on midway through the 
second half along with Marquinhos, with the Brazilian defender making his 435th appearance to equal the club record held by Jean-Marc Pilorget.
Ramos hit the bar after a Hakimi shot was parried, but the Portuguese forward did find the net as PSG’s pressure eventually paid off.
He drove forward and exchanged passes with Mbappe before slotting in to extend their unbeaten record to five months.
Despite their valiant performance, Clermont are bottom and sit seven points from outright safety.
Saturday’s other game in Ligue 1 saw Lens suffer a blow in their quest to qualify for Europe in a draw 1-1 at home to Le Havre.

2,Bilbao beat Mallorca on penalties to win Copa del Rey,SEVILLE: Athletic Bilbao ended a 40-year wait to win the Copa del Rey by beating Real Mallorca 4-2 on penalties on...,"SEVILLE: Athletic Bilbao ended a 40-year wait to win the Copa del Rey by beating Real Mallorca 4-2 on penalties on Saturday following a 1-1 draw after extra time.
The Basque side lifted the trophy for the 24th time, behind only 31-time winners Barcelona, as they edged underdogs Mallorca at La Cartuja stadium in Seville.
Dani Rodriguez sent Mallorca ahead in the first half but Oihan Sancet levelled soon after the break and the sides could not be separated until penalties.
Bilbao goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala saved Manu Morlanes’ penalty and Mallorca’s Nemanja Radonjic lashed another spot kick over the bar, with Bilbao converting all four of theirs to triumph.
Alex Berenguer stroked home the winning penalty to spark wild celebrations among the hordes of travelling Basque support.
Ernesto Valverde’s Bilbao, defeated in their six previous appearances in the final, brought an era of almosts to a close with a hard-fought win.
Having beaten Barcelona and Atletico Madrid en route to the final, Los Leones were able to secure the club’s first major trophy since a domestic league and cup double in 1984. 
“This is incredible, we’ve made history,” man-of-the-match Nico Williams told TVE. “The team worked hard, the fans are always with us and they deserve it, I’ve dreamed of this for a long time.” 
Bilbao, whose players celebrated on a boat known as the ‘Gabarra’ after they last won it, will now get the chance to launch the barge once again next week. 
“I’m so excited (for that), I am so happy, this is the club of my life,” added the Spanish winger, who taunted Mallorca with his dribbling all night.
Mallorca, winners in 2003, had started the stronger and target man Vedat Muriqi’s long-range effort was tipped over uncertainly by Agirrezabala.
In the final for the fourth time, the islanders took the lead after 21 minutes through Rodriguez’s perfectly placed finish.
After Giovanni Gonzalez’s shot was blocked and Jose Copete’s effort was saved, Rodriguez carefully placed the ball into the top corner, past Bilbao’s Dani Vivian on the line.
When Los Leones did create anything it came from the outstanding Nico Williams, and he slotted home after 39 minutes but was offside.
Yuri Berchiche blocked well to deny Copete as Mallorca had a sight of goal for their second, before Nico Williams fired into the side netting after breaking into the area.
Agirrezabala thwarted Canada international Cyle Larin early in the second half before Bilbao found the equaliser.
Again Nico Williams was heavily involved, sliding a pass into the box for Sancet to gleefully stroke beyond Mallorca goalkeeper Dominik Greif to delight Bilbao’s raucous travelling support.
A brilliant dribble by Nico Williams almost helped the Basques take the lead but his cross flashed through his brother Inaki Williams’ legs, with the Ghana international unable to react in time to finish.
Greif beat away a Vivian piledriver late on and Gorka Guruzeta headed narrowly wide, but the teams could not be split before extra time.
Nico Williams had a shot from close range brilliantly deflected wide by the lunging Pablo Maffeo after 111 minutes.
At the other end Agirrezabala was alert to shovel away Muriqi’s header, with the Kosovo striker sporting a large bandage after a painful clash of heads with Unai Gomez.
What followed in the shoot-out was more painful still for Muriqi, who converted his penalty but his team-mates could not follow suit.

3,"Kasatkina downs Pegula, faces Collins in final",CHARLESTON: Russia’s Daria Kasatkina advan­ced to the final of the WTA Charleston Open clay co­u­rt tournament...,"CHARLESTON: Russia’s Daria Kasatkina advan­ced to the final of the WTA Charleston Open clay co­u­rt tournament on Saturday after a three-set semi-final win over top-seeded American Jessica Pegula.
Kasatkina, who needed a lengthy medical timeout in the third set, booked her place in Sunday’s final after prevailing 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5) in two hours and 45 minutes against home hope Pegula.
The Russian fourth seed finished the semi-final with her right leg heavily strapped after a gruelling scrap against her opponent.
Kasatkina looked to be in trouble in the final set tie-break after Pegula raced into a 3-1 lead.
But the 26-year-old — who won the Charleston crown in 2017 — showed great courage to rally back and take control.
She moved to double match point at 6-4 in the tie-break after Pegula smacked a return into the net.
Pegula saved the first match point after Kasatkina hit a forehand long, but the Russian made no mistake on the next point, whipping a superb crosscourt forehand beyond her opponent to seal victory.
Kasatkina will play another American, the in-form Danielle Collins, in the final.
Collins, brimming with confidence following her recent Miami Open victory, took down Greek third seed Maria Sakkari 6-3, 6-3 to continue her recent fine run of form in what is her final season. The world number 22 is now on a 12-match unbeaten streak and Saturday’s win means she has won 21 matches this year.

Early goals from Christian Pulisic and Olivier Giroud, and Rafael Leao’s neat finish shortly before the hour mark were enough for Milan to move 11 points behind runaway leaders Inter Milan, who are at struggling Udinese on Monday.
But with the title all but decided Stefano Pioli’s in-form side are close to securing Champions League football as they lead third-placed Juventus by nine points provisionally after a seventh straight win in all competitions.
A straightforward win at the San Siro was also perfect preparation for Milan’s Italian derby in the Europa League quarter-finals with Roma.
Lecce stay 13th, four points above the relegation zone, but were livid about two decisions which contributed to their heavy defeat.
The away side were already heading to a loss by that point as Pulisic’s deflected strike sent Milan on the way to three points after five minutes before Giroud glanced home Yacine Adli’s corner 14 minutes later.
Leao then added Milan’s third in the 57th minute while Lecce winger Pontus Almqvist was prone on the ground after first being shoulder barged over by Theo Hernandez and then accidentally kneed in the head by the France left-back.
Leao’s sixth league goal of the season came on the break after Hernandez won back possession from Almqvist.
Daniele De Rossi’s Roma won their first local derby in more than two years and made sure of fifth spot in Italy’s top flight for another week.
Gianluca Mancini ensured Roma would have bragging rights in the capital city with a bullet header three minutes before half-time at the Stadio Olimpico.
Italy defender Mancini thumped home his fifth goal of the season from Paulo Dybala’s corner to give Roma a deserved win.
Former Roma captain De Rossi won his first Rome derby as coach at the first attempt after four without a win under his predecessor Jose Mourinho.
Nominal hosts Roma were unlucky not to win more convincingly as they had the better of the chances and Stephan El Shaarawy struck a great chance against the post just after half-time.
In Saturday’s late match, Empoli beat Torino 3-2.

5,Leverkusen on cusp of first Bundesliga title after Bayern loss,BERLIN: Bayer Leverkusen are just three points from a first Bundesliga title after a 1-0 win at Union Berlin on...,"BERLIN: Bayer Leverkusen are just three points from a first Bundesliga title after a 1-0 win at Union Berlin on Saturday, with Bayern Munich letting a two-goal lead slip in a 3-2 loss at Heidenheim.
Bayern were cruising at half-time thanks to strikes from Harry Kane and Serge Gnabry but conceded three times in the second half, losing their second match in a row.
Florian Wirtz converted a penalty deep into first-half stoppage time as Leverkusen were made to work hard in the German capital against 10-man Union, extending their unbeaten run this season to 41 games.
Xabi Alonso’’ side need just three points from their remai­ning six matches to clinch the club’s first league title.
Union did their best to hold on despite Leverkusen’s relentless pressure but gave way just before half-time, Germany defender Robin Gosens picking up a second yellow for a desperation tackle on Nathan Tella near the penalty box.
After some chaotic scenes from the ensuing free-kick the ball connected with the arm of Union captain Christopher Trimmel, giving Leverkusen a penalty after a long VAR review.
Wirtz calmly dispatched the penalty, his third goal in his past two games.
Late in the second half word filtered through to the visiting fans that Bayern were trailing at Heidenheim, sending them into raptures.
Bayern looked in fine form early on, despite missing several injured first teamers including captain Manuel Neuer, Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman, with coach Thomas Tuchel taking a cautious approach with Tuesday’s Champions League trip to Arsenal in mind.
The ever-reliable Kane, yet to miss a league match this campaign, opened the scoring, scrambling in a Gnabry assist after 38 minutes.
Gnabry seemingly had Bayern on track for a simple victory when he scored just before the break, but the hosts turned the match around early in the second half.
Kevin Sessa and Tim Kleindienst both scored inside the space of 90 seconds to level the scores and stun the visitors.
Kleindienst struck again with 11 minutes remaining to snatch victory in their first home match against Bayern, a goal celebrated 460 kilometres away in Leverkusen.
In Saturday’s late game, Stuttgart won 1-0 at Borussia Dortmund to draw level with second-placed Bayern on 60 points.
Serhou Guirassy scored the only goal of the game, blasting in on the counter for his 24th league goal of the season.
Dortmund’s loss means they drop to fifth, pushed out of the top four by RB Leipzig who won 4-1 at Freiburg earlier on Saturday thanks to a brace from Belgium forward Lois Openda.
Mainz won 4-0 at home over last-placed Darmstadt to keep their hopes of avoiding relegation alive. Cologne also boosted their bid to avoid relegation, scoring twice in added time to win 2-1 at home against Bochum.

6,United hold Liverpool to hand Arsenal EPL lead,The draw leaves Liverpool behind Premier League leaders Arsenal on goal difference.,"MANCHESTER: Liverpool’s Premier League title challenge was dented by spectacular goals from Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo, who snatched a 2-2 draw for Manchester United on Sunday.
The visitors dominated the majority of the game but needed a Mohamed Salah penalty six minutes from time to avoid a second defeat at Old Trafford in the space of three weeks.
The draw leaves Liverpool behind Premier League leaders Arsenal on goal difference and just one point ahead of Manchester City with seven games remaining in the tightest of title races.
The home side have the ball in the net after just 90 seconds but Alejandro Garnacho had ran offside well before receiving Fernandes’ pass.
What followed was complete domination by Liverpool, who ended the first half with 15 shots to United’s none.
Andre Onana produced one fine save to deny Dominik Szoboszlai but Liverpool were guilty of consistently letting the hosts off the hook.
Szoboszlai, Salah and Darwin Nunez were all wasteful in front of goal.
Liverpool did lead 1-0 at half-time as Luis Diaz fired in Darwin Nunez’s header from a corner.
The pattern looked set to continue at the start of the second period as Nunez had a goalbound effort blocked.
But Liverpool were stunned as the title race took another twist out of nowhere on 50 minutes.
Jarell Quansah’s slack pass went straight to Fernandes, who spotted Caoimhin Kelleher well off his line and lobbed the Irish goalkeeper from just inside the Liverpool half.
United suddenly had a fresh lease of life as Garnacho’s deflected effort flew just over. Liverpool were still cutting the United defence open at will.
Nunez should have restored the lead when he fired across goal at the end of a lightning counter-attack from a United corner.
Instead, it was United who incredibly went in front 23 minutes from time.
Mainoo has enjoyed a meteoric rise this season and the 18-year-old produced the biggest moment of his career so far by curling into the top corner.
Klopp was incandescent on the touchline at his players for allowing Mainoo to get his shot off and immediately reacted by sending on Harvey Elliott and Cody Gakpo.
Elliott was the man felled by an Aaron Wan-Bissaka lunge for the penalty and Salah kept his cool to score for the 14th time in 15 games against United.
But Liverpool failed to find a winner to hand Arsenal the advantage in the title race thanks to the Gunners’ nine-goal lead on goal difference.
A point also does little to aid United’s hopes of qualifying for next season’s Champions League.
Erik ten Hag’s men are 11 points adrift of fourth-placed Aston Villa and eight behind Tottenham in fifth.
Late on Saturday, Arsenal maintained title charge as goals by Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Leandro Trossard secured a masterful 3-0 victory at Brighton and Hove Albion that sent them back to the top of the table.
Brighton started strongly but Arsenal soon settled, and Saka converted a penalty in the 33rd minute after Tariq Lamptey was adjudged to have clipped Gabriel Jesus in the area.
Arsenal were a constant threat going forward and the away fans were in full voice after Kai Havertz scored from close range from Jorginho’s cut back in the 62nd minute.
Former Brighton player Trossard, on as a substitute, wrapped up the points late after being played through on goal.

7,Babar hails Kakul camp for strengthening ‘unity and understanding’ among players,LAHORE: Pakistan’s fitness camp at the country’s military academy in Kakul “strengthened unity and...,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s fitness camp at the country’s military academy in Kakul “strengthened unity and understanding” among the national team players, captain Babar Azam has said.
Babar’s comments, that he made in a video released by the Pakistan Cricket Board on Sunday, sound ironic as they come amid chaos over the team’s captaincy that had threatened unity and understanding among players more than anything else.
The right-handed batter was reappointed as the Pakistan skipper in place of pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi after the latter had led the side in only one series — a 4-1 T20 loss against New Zealand.
The reappointment of Babar and the removal of Shaheen as captain happened within a period of three to four days during the camp, which also saw Shaheen incensed over the PCB misquoting him in the press release that announced Babar’s return — a controversy which ended in reluctant settlements between the fast bowler and the board.
Following the saga, however, a number of videos from the scenic Army School of Physical Training surfaced, in which the 29 Pakistan probables participating in the 11-day camp were seen undergoing military-style drills focused on strength, stamina and endurance, while also celebrating with each other at the end of tough tasks.
While it may be the first time for most players to experience training at Kakul, it wasn’t so for Babar, whose first assignment in his second stint as captain will be the upcoming five-match T20I series against New Zealand, which starts on April 18. 
“This was my third boot camp, and with each visit, I’ve gleaned new insights,” Babar was quoted as saying in a PCB press release. “This time, our focus extended beyond physical fitness to encompass team bonding activities and performance-improving lectures. 
“These elements are crucial considering our team environment where collective performance is paramount for achieving desired results.”
Spending time with fellow players, especially given that they were sharing rooms, Babar said, helped boost understanding between them.
“Notably, we opted to share rooms, facilitating deeper connections among team members,” he observed. “These shared spaces fostered discussions ranging from strategic planning and team combinations to the evolution of cricket, latest innovations in the sport, analysis of opponents and our approach to each day’s challenges.”
During the camp, the players did not undergo any skill-based practice whatsoever, but that helped them shift focus on other aspects of the sport.
“The notable deviation from previous camps was the absence of cricket-centric activities,” said Babar. “Instead, the emphasis was squarely on physical conditioning, teamwork and mental resilience.”
Former Pakistan vice-captain and star all-rounder Shadab Khan was confident the Kakul camp would help players demonstrate higher levels of fitness, especially with the T20 World Cup – set to be held in the United States and the West Indies in June – around the corner. 
“It has been a new experience training at these marvelous facilities under the watchful eyes of the Pakistan Army trainers,” Shadab said in the PCB statement. “Undoubtedly, all the cricketers will return with improved fitness levels and standards that will significantly contribute when they take the field in the upcoming challenges. The fitter our players are during the season, the greater our chances of success will be.”
After the New Zealand series, which will be staged in Rawal­pindi and Lahore, Pakistan will head to Ireland for three T20s before flying to England for four more games ahead of the T20 World Cup, of which the national side’s campaign starts against the United States in Dallas.
Pakistan are yet to name the squad for the New Zealand series, while who coaches the side in it is also not announced by the PCB so far.

PARIS: Mulugeta Uma and Mestawut Fikir won the Paris Marathon men’s and women’s races on Sunday to give Ethiopia a double in the event for the first time in five years.
On a course that was different from the Olympic event in August, Uma won with a time of 2:05:33, beating Kenyans Titus Kipruto and Elisha Rotich.
Kipruto finished 15 seconds behind Uma while Rotich was more than a minute behind. Rotich was the pre-race favourite going into the event having set the course record in 2021.
In the women’s race, Fikir finished with a time of 2:20:45 in her first marathon, pipping compatriot Enat Tirusew to the line by three seconds, while Kenyan Vivian Cheruiyot was third.
The last time Ethiopia achieved the double in Paris, Abrha Milaw and Gelete Burka won the men’s and women’s races in 2019.
At the Olympics, the men’s marathon will be held on Aug 10 followed by the women’s race a day later.

9,Van der Poel crushes rivals on Paris-Roubaix cobbles,"Already one of cycling’s best-paid riders, Van der Poel wins 30,000 euros (32,500 dollars) for his efforts.","ROUBAIX: Mathieu van der Poel triumphed on the cobbles for a second straight year Sunday after a solo 60-kilometre breakaway to win the Paris-Roubaix race known as ‘the Hell of the North’.
The 29-year-old Dutch world champion won the Tour of Flanders a week ago and crossed the line almost three minutes ahead of the nearest chasers after the brutal 260km run including 57km of cobbles.
“This goes way beyond my expectations, there will be a big party tonight,” he said at the line. “I was at the limit at Flanders but here I really enjoyed the final kilometres,” said van der Poel who was cheered by vast crowds over the final 50km.
Already one of cycling’s best-paid riders, Van der Poel wins 30,000 euros (32,500 dollars) for his efforts and will have his name engraved on a plaque at the outdoor showers where riders usually wash off splatters of mud.
Van der Poel’s team-mate Jasper Philipsen was second and Dane Mads Pedersen was third as they contested a three-way sprint with Nils Politt of the UAE at the line.
The decisive moment came on cobbles with Van der Poel shifting from 40kph to 60kph in almost the blink of an eye, devastating the lead group of around 12 riders which featured Briton Tom Pidcock.
Pidcock had lost key support when team-mate Josh Tarling wasthrown off the race for holding on to a team car when trying to catch up with the lead group following a puncture.
The hefty cobbles that make up the surface of around 57km of the route, in 29 sections, cause countless punctures, broken wheels and falls.
The 175-rider peloton burst away from the Compiegne start line 80km outside Paris headed north despite a recent spate nasty crashes.
Organisers had introduced a las- minute safety measure after Jonas Vingegaard, Wout van Aert and Jay Vine all suffered serious injuries in recent cycling falls.
As the race approached the Arenberg coal-mine the cycling world held its breath as the peloton approached the controversial safety chicane designed to slow the pack.
The move was unpopular with the riders, but it did the trick, with no fallers.
This ultra-long ‘Queen of the Classics’ usually features miles of mud as well as the millions of cobbles, but on Sunday it was raced in bright sunshine through the glimmering green fields bordering Belgium.
Some 106 bikes were inspected at Compiegne ahead of the race in the fight against electronic fraud, with eight bikes subjected to x-rays.

10,Dominant Verstappen clinches Japanese GP in Red Bull one-two,The triple world champion claimed his third win in the four races so far this year.,"SUZUKA: Max Verstappen said Red Bull must capitalise on their early season dominance after romping to victory in Sunday’s Japanese Grand Prix ahead of team-mate Sergio Perez.
The triple world champion claimed his third win in the four races so far this year and on this evidence the Dutchman and Red Bull will take some stopping once again.
Verstappen failed to finish in Australia a fortnight ago because of a brake issue but starting from pole he controlled the race at Suzuka from start to finish.
“I know there will be tracks coming up that might not be so favourable for us,” said Verstappen, who took the chequered flag 12.5sec ahead of the Mexican Perez.
“But then of course when we do get to the tracks where we can be quick, we have to really take advantage of it and score maximum points as a team.”
Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz, who triumphed in Melbourne, was third in dry, sunny conditions at Suzuka.
Verstappen has taken an early stranglehold on the world championship on 77 points, with Perez on 64 and Sainz’s Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc on 59.
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff told reporters after the race that  “no one is going to catch Max this year”.
“Basically the rest of the season now is the best of the rest, that’s the fact,” said Wolff.
Verstappen said this week that Suzuka was one of his favourite circuits and he has now won the Japanese Grand Prix three times in a row.
“Of course Melbourne felt like a bit of a hiccup,” he said. “But what we did today was what we want to do, and that’s what we aim to do every single weekend.”
Perez was also coming off a weekend to forget after finishing fifth in Australia.
He did not complete the race last year at Suzuka but was comfortable in holding off Sainz for second.
“I think we have a good momentum,” said Perez.
“Last year here was probably my worst weekend, so I think if we are strong here, I think we can be strong anywhere else.
“It’s been a good weekend.”
Leclerc, who started from eighth on the grid, came home in fourth.
McLaren’s Lando Norris, second in last year’s race, was fifth ahead of Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso.
Mercedes’ George Russell edged out McLaren’s Oscar Piastri for seventh, while Lewis Hamilton was ninth in the other Mercedes.
Japan’s Yuki Tsunoda was 10th for RB, scoring points at his home grand prix for the first time.
Verstappen was starting from pole for the fourth time in as many Grands Prix events, but the race was almost immediately red-flagged after RB’s Daniel Ricciardo and Williams’ Alex Albon collided in a frenetic start.
Albon’s front wing clipped into the rear of Ricciardo’s car as they jockeyed for position and both slammed into the wall before getting out unscathed, but their race was over.
The action resumed from a standing start and Verstappen picked up from where he left off ahead of Perez.
“Whenever I needed to go faster I could, whenever I needed to look after my tyres I could,” said Verstappen. “That’s always a nice feeling to have when you’re driving.”
Verstappen and Perez consolidated their positions, leaving Norris fighting for third against the two Ferraris.
A late lock-up cost the McLaren driver his chance of a podium finish.
Sainz said finishing third was  “very satisfying”.
“We kind of knew our race pace was better than our qualifying pace — still probably not enough to go for a win,” said the Spaniard.
“Given how the race pace on the Red Bull is, it’s almost impossible to think about a win.”
The championship resumes in a fortnight’s time with the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai.
It will be the first time the event has been held since 2019, before it was curtailed by the pandemic.
