• Troops leave to ‘prepare for more operations, including in Rafah’
• Netanyahu claims they are ‘one step from victory’
• Protesters in Tel Aviv demand ‘elections now’
• Aid agencies decry ‘shocking’ toll six months into war
GAZA STRIP: Israel pulled its ground forces out of the southern Gaza Strip on Sunday, media reports said, in a partial withdrawal six months into the devastating war started on October 7.
The news of the partial withdrawal came on the day talks towards a truce and prisoners release deal were expected to resume in Cairo, including US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators.
CIA chief Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani will join Egyptian officials for indirect talks from Sunday between the Israeli and Hamas delegations, Egypt’s Al-Qahera News said.
But the military said a “significant force” will keep operating elsewhere in the besieged Palestinian territory, able “to conduct precise intelligence based operations”.
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was just “one step away from victory” and vowed there would be no let-up in fighting until Hamas releases all prisoners.
Speaking as new truce talks were due to be held in Cairo, he told his cabinet that “there will be no ceasefire without the return of prisoners. It just won’t happen.”
Netanyahu stressed that “Israel is ready for a deal; Israel is not ready to surrender”.
Meanwhile, air strikes kept pounding Khan Yunis and Rafah during the night, eyewitnesses said.
More operations
Israeli troops that have pulled out of Gaza on Sunday did so to prepare for future operations, including in the enclave’s southern city of Rafah, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said.
“The forces are exiting and preparing for their next missions, we saw examples of such missions in the Shifa operation, and also of their coming mission in the Rafah area,” Gallant said at a meeting with military officials, according to a statement from his office.
Netanyahu has meanwhile come under intense pressure at home from families and supporters of prisoners, and from a resurgent anti-government protest movement.
Ten of thousands rallied in Tel Aviv and other cities on Saturday, demanding “elections now”.
Among the protesters was Israel’s centrist opposition leader Yair Lapid, who was later headed to Washington, his Yesh Atid party said.
Aid agencies decry ‘shocking’ toll
Separately, United Nations agencies and other aid organisations decried on Sunday the devastating toll wreaked by six months of war in Gaza, warning that the situation is “beyond catastrophic”.
“Six months is an awful milestone,” the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said, warning that “humanity has been all but abandoned”.
World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus voiced outrage at “the deaths and grievous injuries of thousands of children in Gaza”, which he said would “remain a stain on all of humanity”.
“This assault on present and future generations must end.” Unicef chief Catherine Russell pointed out that more than 13,000 children were reportedly among those killed.
The UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths insisted on Saturday that there needed to be “a reckoning for this betrayal of humanity”.
The IFRC chief Jagan Chapagain meanwhile described the situation as “beyond catastrophic”, with “millions of lives are at risk of hunger.”

1,"Yellen, Premier Li express hope for US-China cooperation",US Treasury says both sides will start talks on tackling money laundering,"BEIJING: US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Premier Li Qiang sounded a hopeful tone on US-China cooperation on Sunday, though the American policymaker noted both sides cannot shy away from tough conversations.
The US-China relationship can only move forward with direct and open communication, Yellen told Li after arriving in the Chinese capital from the southern city of Guangzhou.
“China sincerely hopes that the two countries will be partners, not adversaries,” Li said in welcoming remarks to Yellen.
He added that Chinese internet users have closely followed the details of her trip since her appearance in Guangzhou, showing “expectation and hope for the China-US relationship to continue to improve”.

US Treasury says both sides will start talks on tackling money laundering

Yellen had a series of meetings in the southern port city, including hours of discussions with her counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng.
Both countries have since agreed to hold talks on balanced growth under an existing working group, allowing officials to discuss the key US concern of “overcapacity”.
This refers to a situation where Chinese government support to industries fuels production capacity but risks a surge of exports at depressed prices to the global market, undercutting international competitors.
Washington is especially concerned about this phenomenon in new industries such as electric vehicles and solar energy, pushing for a “level playing field” for US firms and workers.
“While we have more to do, I believe that, over the past year, we have put our bilateral relationship on more stable footing,” she said in opening remarks to Premier Li as she began two days of high-level talks in Beijing.
Rather than avoiding hard conversations, this has meant “understanding that we can only make progress if we directly and openly communicate with one another”, the Treasury chief said.
A senior Treasury official told reporters Yellen had a “constructive conversation” with Li.
On overcapacity concerns, she raised issues from the perspective of a macroeconomist, seeking to understand the expected sources of demand in meeting Chinese growth targets, with sectors like property providing less growth than before, the official added.
Tensions remain
On Saturday, the Treasury also announced that United States and Chinese officials would start talks under another existing working group for cooperation on tackling money laundering.
The aim is to cut off financing for actors such as drug traffickers.
Washington has been seeking to work with Beijing to curb supply lines for the production of fentanyl, the synthetic painkiller behind a US overdose epidemic.
Despite the outcomes of meetings so far, China’s state-run Xinhua news agency warned in a commentary of the “spectre of protectionism” in the United States.
It criticised existing US tariffs on Chinese imports while accusing Washington of “suppressing” China’s electric vehicle-related industries, signalling tensions that remain.
‘Possibility for progress’
“Yellen’s visit has opened space to test the possibility for progress,” Brookings Institution senior fellow Ryan Hass told AFP.
He added that her trip has “illuminated that the Chinese recognise a need to engage on overcapacity and are prepared to explore cooperation on anti-money laundering”.
But only time can tell if these efforts bring material progress, he said.
In meetings with Vice Premier He, Yellen also warned companies in China not to provide support for Russia’s war in Ukraine — including to Moscow’s defence industrial base — cautioning of “significant consequences”.
Ahead of talks with Beijing mayor Yin Yong on Sunday, Yellen stressed the need to engage with local officials to understand China’s “economic future”.
“Local governments play a critical role, from boosting consumption to addressing overinvestment, and Beijing, of course, has particular importance,” she said.
A senior Treasury official told reporters Saturday that Washing­ton believes household spending needs to be a bigger part of China’s economy. On Monday, she is due to speak with former vice premier Liu He and central bank governor Pan Gongsheng.

2,Trump ‘prefers jail’ to being silenced,He has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records and denies an encounter with porn star Stormy Daniels.,"WASHINGTON: For­mer US President Donald Trump said it would be a great honour to go to jail for violating a gag order imposed by the judge who will hear his upcoming trial on charges stemming from a hush-money payment to a porn star.
“If this Partisan Hack wants to put me in the ‘clink’ for speaking the open and obvious TRUTH, I will gladly become a Modern Day Nelson Mandela — It will be my GREAT HONOR,” Trump posted on Saturday on his Truth Social platform.
Trump was referring to Justice Juan Merchan, who will preside over his trial in New York state court in Manhattan on criminal charges of covering up a $130,000 payment before the 2016 election to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged sexual encounter.
The trial begins on April 15.
The Republican, who is challenging Democratic President Biden in the presidential race, has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records and denies an encounter with Daniels, whose real name is Step­hanie Clifford.
