0,Sabre-rattling threatens already tense Middle East,"IDF general, defence minister say they are ""ready to deal"" with Iran.","• Top Iranian official warns of possible attacks on Israeli embassies
• FM Abdollahian says US missiles used to attack Damascus consulate
• IDF general, defence minister say they are ‘ready to deal’ with Iran
TEHRAN / JERU­SALEM: The Middle East tinderbox saw yet another spark on Sunday, as rivals Iran and Israel directly threatened to attack each other for the first time in the six months since Tel Aviv launched its invasion of Gaza.
An adviser to Iran’s supreme leader warned that Israeli embassies are “no longer safe” after a strike in Syria, which Tehran blamed on Tel Aviv, killed seven members of the Revolutionary Guards early last week.
In response, Israeli officials have said their forces could “handle Iran”. The United States is also on high alert and preparing for a possible attack.
Tehran vowed to avenge the air strike in Damascus that levelled the Iranian embassy’s consular annex and claimed the lives of two IRGC generals, Mohammad Reza Zahedi and Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi.
Zahedi, 63, had held several commands during a career spanning more than 40 years.
He was the most senior Iranian soldier killed since the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani in 2020.
“The embassies of the Zionist regime are no longer safe,” said Yahya Rahim Safavi, senior adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, AFP reported on Sunday quoting the ISNA news agency.
“The resistance front is ready; how it (the response) will be, we have to wait,” Safavi said, noting that “confronting this brutal regi­me is a legal and legitimate right”.
He also noted that multiple Israeli embassies around the region “have been shuttered”.
Meanwhile, the semi-official ISNA news agency also published a graphic, showing weapons that it said would be capable of striking Israel Separately, Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdo­llahian claimed on Sunday that the missiles and aircraft used to attack the consulate were US-made.
“Our consulate in Damascus was targeted using American fighters and missiles,” he said, according to Al Jazeera.
Abdollahian, who is due to arrive in Syria today (Monday), also reportedly said that the “refusal of Washington, London and Paris to condemn the consulate attack is evidence of support for the Zionist entity’s adventures and expansion of the conflict.”
Israel’s response
US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a phone call last we­ek, during which they reportedly dis­cus­sed the threat, including what preparations could be made in anticipation of Iran’s “inevitable” retaliation.
Although Israel has not confirmed it was behind the strike on Dam­ascus, its leaders have said in more general terms that they are operating against Iran, which they accuse of backing Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both of which have been in combat with Israel for the past six months.
After the statement by Mr Safavi, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant’s office said he held an “operational situation assessment” with senior military officers.
“Upon completing the assessment, Minister Gallant emphasized that the defense establishment has completed preparations for respon­ses in the event of any scenario that may develop vis–vis Iran,” his office said.
Later, the Israeli military chief also said they could handle any Iranian threat.
“The IDF can handle Iran,” Chief of General Staff Herzi Halevi said in a televised statement. “We can act forcefully against Iran in places near and far. We are cooperating with the United States and with strategic partners in the region,” said Halevi.
Iran’s options
Writing in The National, Beirut Institute chairwoman Raghida Dergham noted: “Iran doesn’t want a full-scale war but aims to show Israel the risk of a costly conflict.”
“One likely decision by Tehran is to increase support for the Houthis, encouraging them to escalate Red Sea attacks to disrupt international navigation,” she wrote.
Tehran could also “consider shooting down Israeli aircraft in Syrian airspace… [while] another option is a targeted attack on the port of Haifa, aiming to destroy its infrastructure,” she noted.

1,‘Bus carrying Chinese was not bombproof’,Probe finds glaring lapses in security detail of slain Chinese engineers; woman engineer also among dead.,"PESHAWAR: A committee tasked with investigating the suicide attack in Bisham which killed six people last month has pointed out significant lapses in the security detail of the Chinese engineers and a blatant disregard for the standard operating procedures (SOPs).
Sources said that a three-member committee, comprising two senior officials from the federal and one from the KP government, had been directed to assess if the movement of the Chinese nationals on March 26 was in accordance with the SOPs. Six people, including five Chinese nationals, were killed after a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into their bus in Bisham, Kohistan.
On March 27, the government reiterated its resolve to comprehensively combat militancy and bring the perpetrators behind the attack to justice.
At the same time, it announced a swift probe as China demanded a thorough investigation into the deadly blast.

Probe finds glaring lapses in security detail of slain Chinese engineers; woman engineer also among dead

During the course of the probe, the investigators found that the bus transporting the foreign nationals was not even bulletproof, let alone bombproof, which is a requirement under the security SOPs.
Sources said that the committee pointed out multiple flaws in the provision of security to Chinese nationals. Sources said the committee was shocked to learn that “the vehicle carrying the Chinese nationals should have been bombproof but the vehicle was not even bulletproof”.
They further said the company “that was required to provide bullet- and bombproof vehicles to transport Chinese workers, and duly paid for, failed to meet its contractual obligations”.
“Vehicles carrying the Chinese nationals should be bombproof, according to the SOPs but two forensic audits show they were not even bulletproof,” the sources said, adding that the committee also informed the federal government that it was difficult to pinpoint inefficiencies because there was no unity of command in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) task force.
Sources privy to the report filed by the committee said the district police officer in Upper Kohistan was supposed to be informed about the convoy movement seven days in advance but not only was the DPO informed late, but the police officer “totally forgot to convey the message about the Chinese nationals’ movement to anyone further”.
They said that the committee also held the security director of the Dasu dam as well as the director general of the Special Security Unit negligent.
According to the crime scene report of the KP Counter-Terrorism Depar­tment, a suicide bomber had rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a convoy of engineers which was on its way from Mansehra to their camp in Dasu, about 5.7km from the Bisham police station.
The report said that five Chinese nationals including a woman and their Pakistani driver were killed in the attack.
Sources privy to the CTD report told Dawn that the Chinese nationals were travelling in a coaster at Laho Nala when a Vitz car rammed into the bus.
According to the CTD report, the impact of the incident caused the coaster to fall into a ditch, which led to the immediate death of all six persons.
They said that apart from the committee, the CTD report also stated that prima facie the vehicle carrying Chinese did not appear to be bulletproof.

4,World Bank wants unified GST collection agency,"Stresses need for national fiscal policy by aligning federal, provincial spending.","• Stresses need for national fiscal policy by aligning federal, provincial spending
• Urges govt to effectively tax agriculture, capital gains and real estate in next budget
• Suggests broader revenue reforms to expand tax base
ISLAMABAD: The World Bank has asked Pakistan to adopt a national fiscal policy by aligning federal and provincial spending with constitutional mandates, merge various federal and provincial revenue agencies into a single general sales tax (GST) collection agency, and effectively tax agriculture, capital gains and real estate in the next fiscal year’s budget.
“Implement the new Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Acts (FDRLA) at the federal and provincial levels, including through development and implementation of a national medium-term fiscal framework through the FY25 budget process,” the World Bank asked the government in its latest policy advice.
This is now expected to be made part of the next International Monetary Fund programme that Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb will be discussing with the lender next week in Washington on the sidelines of World Bank-IMF spring meetings.
The bank demanded tangible progress on GST harmonisation across the federation and its federating units, “including through rollout of the GST portal” and move towards “rate harmonisation to facilitate tax compliance and the provision of input tax credits”.
On top of this, the World Bank also suggested “consolidation of all GST collection responsibilities with a single agency, which could then distribute revenues in accordance with constitutional provisions” to reduce administrative complexity.
At present, GST is collected by the Federal Board of Revenue, mostly on goods and some services, while similar revenue boards are operating in provinces to collect GST on some services. However, given the overlapping nature of certain services, the stakeholders have been facing GST collection adjustments among the provinces.
More importantly, the World Bank wants decisive actions to mobilise revenues from underutilised sources — particularly those relating to the unfinished agenda of the 7th National Finance Commission (NFC) award of 2010: urban immovable property tax, agricultural income tax, and capital gain taxes.
 
 

While conceding greater federal pool resources to the provinces, it was agreed to effectively bring these areas into the tax net to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio to 15 per cent in five years, but the deal (NFC) was drafted in a weak manner.
The NFC had “recommended that the federal and provincial governments streamline their tax collection systems to reduce leakages and increase their revenue through efforts to improve taxes and achieve a tax-to-GDP ratio of 15pc by terminal year 2014-15. Provinces would initiate steps to effectively tax the agriculture and real estate sectors”. However, this has remained a pipe dream over the following 15 years.
As for urban immovable property tax, the World Bank has demanded the application of harmonised valuation tables (currently based on rental value) to be updated annually based on observed variables such as inflation, insurance valuation, and sales records, and also to equalise rates between owner-occupiers and rentals.
In this regard, the bank also wants authorities to harmonise and reduce exemptions such as area-based exemptions, owner-occupier exemptions, and non-resident exemptions and to unify federal deemed income tax and urban immovable property tax.
For agricultural income tax, the World Bank has asked the government to make the definition of land area consistent, reconsider exemptions based on the size of land holdings and set common minimum rates based on crop acreage or production estimates.
At the same time, the government should also incorporate irrigation and/or constructed buildings to differentiate per-hectare minimum rates.
Regarding the capital gains tax, the bank has advised the government to unify the treatment of builders, property developers, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and others, simplify the types of taxes related to capital gains and transfers — capital gains tax (CGT), capital value tax (CVT), stamp duty, withholding tax, etc — and remove years-held based differential rates and simplify the rate structure.
Overall, the World Bank has suggested broader revenue reforms to expand the tax base, improve progressivity and ease compliance.
To achieve this, it wants to close existing corporate and sales tax exemptions, including tax exemptions for real estate, the energy sector, Covid response, and some basic household goods, and instead compensate poor households for negative impacts through enhanced social protection.
To improve tax compliance, the bank has called for addressing constraints delaying the rollout of the track-and-trace system to all sectors and simplifying the tax structure by reforming the “personal income tax (PIT) system to reduce complexity by aligning schemes for salaried and non-salaried workers” and reform PIT schedules to increase equity by eliminating privileged treatment of specific income sources and by harmonising rate structures across taxable income sources.
The Planning Commission has already prepared a national planning framework for the upcoming National Economic Council, with the overall theme of ending provincial projects from the federal budget and improving resource deployment through federal and provincial “synergy” in the light of the “true spirit of the constitutional scheme”, including the 7th National Finance Commission Award and 18th constitutional amendment.
An official said the planning framework would “offer an operational strategy for federal and provincial governments in the context of prevailing constitutional responsibilities and roles for the shared and common objective of development and growth”.
He said the concept of balanced development and regional equity was not only the responsibility of the federal government but equally that of the provinces through their respective development programmes, and it was also the essence of the 7th NFC and 18th Amendment.
