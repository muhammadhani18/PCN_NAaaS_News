0,"After cold response from investors, CDA plans major changes to policy","Investors had been moving to Central Business District Lahore, says official","ISLAMABAD: After getting a cold response from investors to its auction of commercial plots in recent years, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has decided to bring major changes to its policy to promote development and business activity in the city.
Sources said that to help the business community, the CDA was planning to increase the payment period for commercial plots from one year to three years, whereas floor area ratio will also be increased to 1:16. Similarly, there is also a plan to give possession to developers after receiving 50pc payment instead of the current 100pc.
Sources said in the last two years the CDA could not get an overwhelming response from investors during auction of commercial plots. On the other hand, Central Business District (CBD) Lahore has become an attractive organisation for investors from across Pakistan, including Islamabad. The sources said a number of investors who in the past used to purchase plots in Islamabad had now moved to Lahore.
“The CDB Lahore has become more attractive for investors and a number of our old investors are now investing in Lahore apparently because of our rigid polices,” said an official of CDA.

Investors had been moving to Central Business District Lahore, says official

He said the management of the CDA had reviewed all contributing factors responsible for the cold response from the investors in Islamabad.
When contacted, CDA Chairman Anwarul Haq confirmed to Dawn that a new policy was being finalised.
“Yes, we are going to introduce a new investor friendly policy like CBD to promote business activity as well as boost country’s economy, but at this stage I can’t share any further details,” he said.
However, another officer said in the upcoming meeting of CDA board, the new policy will be presented before it for final approval.
He confirmed that there would be an increase in payment years besides giving possession on 50pc payment.
Former president of Islamabad Developer Association Chaudhry Naseer Ahmed told Dawn that it was his longstanding demand.
“If CDA is going to fulfill our demand this is something highly appreciable,” he said and added that this policy will boost development and business activities in Islamabad.
He said because of CDA’s rigid policy, Islamabad-based investors were investing in Lahore and even in private housing societies. Mr Ahmed said that besides introducing new policies, CDA should also pay focus on facilitating those who made investments in previous auctions.
“You know investors who purchased plots in new food streets last year are still waiting to know the exact location of their plots as CDA has not made any construction work. Similarly, in Blue Area G-8, G-9 portion, there is a need for work to develop parking lots and landscaping,” he said.
He said there was also a need for five-year tenure of the CDA chairman for consistency in policies.
“With the change of chairman, policies also suffer,” he said and recalled that during the five-year tenure of former chairman Kamran Lashari lots of development work such as construction of 7th Avenue, 9th Avenue, expansion of Faisal Avenue, Blue Area flyover were carried completed.
“Developers and investors of Islamabad will fully support CDA and the federal government if the civic agency introduces a new policy regarding auction of commercial plots,” he said.

A senior official of the district administration told Dawn that the six routes that had already been allocated for the buses would help people get better transport service. He said that these buses will serve as feeder buses for the Metro Bus Service between Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
He also said that the procurement of the buses was to start in January 2024, but due to general elections it was delayed.
The provincial government will procure the buses for three major cities, including Rawalpindi, Lahore and Multan.
“In the first phase of the feeder routes project, 78 buses will be operated on six routes,” the senior official said, adding that the new routes had been identified and the Regional Transport Authority had allocated the buses on these routes to link them with the metro bus stations.
The official said procurement would be completed by the next fiscal year and at the same time the rehabilitation work on the metro elevated road would also be completed to the tune of Rs740 million soon by the RDA and Punjab Mass Transit Authority.
He also said one of the routes from Saddar to Rawat Mandi Mor has been extended to Gujar Khan. Other routes are Dhoke Kashmirian to Liaquat Bagh via Tipu Road, Dhoke Kashmirian to Chandani Chowk, Pirwadahi Morr to Marrir Chowk via GT Road, and Faizabad to IJP Road to Khanna Pul.
When contacted, Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema said that the procurement process had been initiated by the provincial government and the project will likely start in the next two months.
He said that they had completed the arrangements for the project and in this regard 30 kanals on Peshawar Road had been allocated for a depot for electric buses.
“We have made plans to construct an electric recharge station, a workshop and a service station in the area. The PC-I has been completed and sent to the Punjab government for approval,” he said.

4,Health ministry starts work on outsourcing diagnostic services at Pims,"Employees say they will resist decision, claim it is another move to privatise hospital.","ISLAMABAD: While citizens are already hit hard by rising inflation and their medical treatment under the health card are being denied, the health ministry has started working on outsourcing diagnostic services at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), rural health centres (RHCs) and basic health units (BHUs).
The move will put an extra financial burden on patients who are currently getting either free of cost diagnostic services or paying nominal fees.
The employees of the hospital have announced to resist the decision saying it was another move for privatisation of the hospital.
However, Secretary Health Iftikhar Ali Shallawani said the ministry was undergoing a paradigm shift under the prime minister and his coordinator Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Bharath through public-private partnerships to bring efficiency and reduce cost for the poor and needy.

Employees say they will resist decision, claim it is another move to privatise hospital

According to documents available with Dawn, Dr Bharath visited Pims on March 29 and directed its management to construct a virtual tower for super specialities in the hospital. He also ordered an evening outpatient department (OPD) and outsourcing of the diagnostic unit of Pims.
The document stated that necessary instructions may be passed to the concerned to take necessary action on direction of the health coordinator.
After getting the written direction, Pims Executive Director Prof Dr Rana Imran Sikander has issued a written directive to submit a detailed plan for outsourcing the diagnostics.
Letters written to the head of Pathology Department Dr Ahmareen Khalid Sheikh and the head of Radiology Department Prof Ayesha Isani, available with Dawn, stated: “You are hereby advised to submit detailed plan for outsourcing of diagnostic services of Pathology Department/Radiology Department of Pims as per the directives of the Honourable Coordinator to Prime Minister within two days positively.”
A senior doctor at Pims, requesting anonymity, said that the diagnostic process involved diagnosing diseases through pathological or radiological tests.
“The facility of health card was introduced by then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 2016 in Islamabad but later PTI took its ownership and introduced it in most of the parts of Pakistan. During the tenure of PDM government the facility of health card was curtailed or denied to a number of patients. Later, the caretaker government totally suspended the facility in Punjab and further curtailed it in Islamabad due to non-availability of funds,” he said.
“Pathology and radiology tests were being provided either free of cost or on nominal charges but now it seems the facility will be discontinued. We are hearing that private labs will be requested to control the lab and radiology department of Pims. The hospital has just got a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine having market price of over Rs250 million but now it may be handed over to some private party,” he said.
He said currently Pims charged Rs100 for complete blood picture test compared to around Rs1000 in the market.
“Even then prime minister Shaukat Aziz in 2005-06 announced a vertical tower at Pims but it could not be constructed till date. The incumbent government cannot go for such projects. It will only discontinue existing facilities to reduce its expenditure,” he said.
However, another doctor, who seems to be in favour of outsourcing the diagnostics, said it will expedite the process of testing and bring credibility to tests conducted at the hospital.
“At the moment, a number of employees don’t want to work or they misbehave with patients. However, after outsourcing the diagnostics, patients will get respect and they may have to pay fewer than the private market,” he said.
Employees announce to resist move
However, Federal Health Alliance (FHA), a representative body of employees, has announced to resist the decision calling it a move to privatise the hospital.
In a statement, FHA stated that in the past Pims was put under a university and then during PTI’s tenure it was declared a Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) suggesting that the hospital should generate its own funds.
FHA Chairman Chaudhry Qamar Gujjar said that after the Eid holiday, a meeting of all representative bodies of the hospital will be called.
“We will resist the move as it will increase problems of patients,” he said.
President Paramedics Association Chaudhry Annas, Raja Rab Nawaz, Naveed Azad, Faisal Tanoli and other employees have urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and withdraw the decision.
Committee to look after process
When contacted, a senior official of health ministry said that the ministry had constituted a committee tasked with development of a proposal for establishing a 24/7 health emergency management system in Islamabad, utilising the existing RHCs under a public-private model.
He said the senior joint secretary (hospitals) at the health ministry, chief executive officer Islamabad Healthcare Regulatory Authority, executive director Pims, district health officer, chief executive officer Sehat Sahulat Programme and senior medical officer incharge RHC Tarlai were members of the committee.

6,Bears in IWMB care receive vital medical aid,"Four Paws team performs dental procedures, provides essential vaccination to several rescued animals","ISLAMABAD: In a heartening display of collaborative effort, the Four Paws team has completed a series of crucial medical interventions to improve the lives of several bears under the care of the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB).
The joint team of the IWMB and Four Paws carried out veterinary checks, including essential castrations, on the final three bears residing in the rescue centre.
Among them, Baloo underwent treatment for a wound on his neck and underwent dental surgery to address inflammation and abscess issues, resulting in the removal of three teeth, including a canine and two incisors. Daboo, fortunately, showed no dental issues but bore the unfortunate scars of having his ears cropped at a very young age.
Cukoo’s dental surgery was tricky with approximately five teeth requiring extraction due to complications arising from illegal captivity as a dancing bear, where the improper removal of roots led to frequent inflammation and abscesses. All three bears also received essential vaccinations, anti-parasitic treatments, microchipping, claw trimming, and castrations to ensure their well-being.

In another development, the female bear Anila received vital veterinary attention on Friday. In addition to treating an open wound and removing a bothersome metal ring causing irritation and infection, Anila underwent a comprehensive medical examination, including an ultrasound, and received essential vaccinations as well as microchips.
“Following her surgery, Anila is recuperating well and will soon join fellow bears Ladoo and Barfi in her new enclosure, complete with comfortable straw bedding,” Dr Amir Khalil, who is team leader of Four Paws, told Dawn on Sunday.
On Saturday, the team executed medical procedures on four additional bears: male bears Teddy, Makra, and Ladoo, along with female bear Barfi. The males underwent castrations and dental work.
“Meanwhile, Barfi received a critical dental procedure, removing two canines and two incisors, ensuring her continued health and comfort. Like their counterparts, all four bears received comprehensive veterinary assessments, including ultrasounds, vaccinations, anti-parasite treatments, microchipping, claw trimming, and dental care. Some of these bears had to undergo life-saving procedures to ensure their good health,” said Dr Amir Khalil.
Dr Amir Khalil appreciated the dedicated efforts of his team and IWMB rescue centre professionals. “These treated bears are now thriving post-procedure, embodying the promise of a brighter future for animals in need,” he said.
Chairperson of Islamabad Wildlife Management Board Rina Saeed Khan said, “The bears are now getting the best treatment in the world.”
The global animal welfare organisation Four Paws had returned to Pakistan on April 5, upon urgent request of the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board.
A team of Four Paws veterinarians and wildlife experts will support the Pakistani wildlife authorities with the veterinary treatment and neutering of eight resident bears, as well as the planned rescue and relocation of new confiscated bears from bear baiting, dancing, and breeding activities.
Four Paws maintained that the cruel practices violated local animal welfare regulations and caused massive animal suffering. In cooperation with the Pakistani government, Four Paws aimed to end illegal bear-keeping practices in the country.

At a meeting of RTA chaired by Deputy Commissioner Rao Atif Raza,who is also the RTA chairman, it was decided to form special squads to check exploitation of travelers by transporters.
The transporters representatives who also attended the meeting were warned that strict action would be taken against overcharging and overloading.
RTA Secretary Zaheer Ahmed Khan informed the participants that this year special quads would launch a special grand operation on Monday and violators would not only be charged with fines but their vehicles would also be impounded. He added that a control room had been set up at the RTA office.
He said: “Stern action would be taken against transporters found overcharging and overloading as the transporters have a habit of fleecing home-bound citizens by charging exorbitant fares.”
The officials of the proposed squads were directed to check overcharging and overloading of passengers in buses and vans.
“The checking will be carried out randomly at different places. Strict action will be taken on the spot and excess fares will be returned to the passengers,” he added.
Later, talking to newsmen at the intercity and inter-district bus stand, the DC said action would be taken against transporters found involved in overcharging.

11,Residents of AJK’s Gurez valley hit hard by prolonged winters,Mohammad Arshad is a local councillor in Saonar ward in the upper belt of Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s picturesque...,"Mohammad Arshad is a local councillor in Saonar ward in the upper belt of Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s picturesque Neelum valley – one of the most attractive tourist destinations located northeast of state capital Muzaffarabad.
In most parts of the lower belt of the valley, River Neelum serves as the Line of Control (LoC). However, beyond Lawat, the valley straddles the river up to the last village of Taobutt.
The 45-kilometre-long-stretch between Kel and Taobutt is known as Gurez sub-valley. Famous villages between Kel and Taobutt are Machal, Jandar Seri, Janwai, Phullawai, Marnat, Saonar, Sardari, Halmat, Shundas, Nikrun and Kareemabad. Gurez sub-valley is hit hard by harsh winters as the main road leading through it is mostly engulfed by snow and landslides for about six months.
Saonar, from where Mr Arshad comes from, comprises two hamlets – Saonar Bala (upper) and Saonar Paen (lower) – which lie between 2300-2400 metres above sea level on the left bank of River Neelum. These hamlets are accessed by a suspension bridge from the main Neelum valley road where a small bazaar also houses Mr Arshad’s grocery shop.

“Climate change has drastically affected the weather pattern of our area, dragging rainy and snowy spells in times which would otherwise herald the advent of spring,” he tells Dawn.
The last heavy snowfall was witnessed in the upper reaches of Neelum valley in March which has further delayed the spring season, thus multiplying the worries of villagers in the high-altitude areas, he says.
Of the month of March, he said: “No sooner had we removed piles of snow from our rooftops than another spell of snowfall greeted us to perpetuate our miseries.”

According to Mr Arshad, normally every year flowers start blossoming and vegetation becomes gradually visible from the middle of March. “But this year, as yet there are no signs of flowers, it seems they will blossom somewhere in the third week of April, thanks to irregular rain and snowfall patterns.”
Mr Arshad said timely snowfall, that is in November and December, would maintain the moisture in their fields throughout the summers. However, due to the off-season rains and snow the fields had not deeply absorbed moisture, he said, adding this would mean low yield of crops.

According to him, the most depressing problem for the Gurez sub-valley inmates is the closure of the main road during the six months of winter, due to which many patients lose lives for being unable to reach downstream health facilities in time.
“It’s the villagers themselves who have to spade away snow to create a pedestrian’s track to be able to ferry their sick to the hospital on their shoulders.”
He stressed that the government should address this issue on a scientific basis.

“The machinery for the purpose should be made available along the vulnerable areas round the clock - in working condition and with filled in fuel tanks - to leave no room for the concerned department to shirk its duty in this regard.”
