0,The helping hand of Jitendra Singh,Citizen buys grocery for several families every day during Ramazan,"Several Sikh citizens of Lahore voluntarily organise Iftar and Langar every year during the holy moth Ramazan.
A youth from the community who arranges grocery and employment for dozens of poor families, Sardar Jitendra Singh, is a herbal practitioner by profession, but at the same time, he actively participates in social work and welfare activities.

Speaking to The Express Tribune, Jitendera Singh said that he used to live in Peshawar but now he is permanently residing in Lahore. He began serving his humanitarian cause in Peshawar, which has now made its way to Lahore.
Singh says that he buys grocery for four to five families every day during Ramazan. The ration bags are subsequently placed at the doorsteps of the homes of the deserving families in the dark of night so that their dignity does not get compromised.

According to Jitendra Singh, he has distributed ration to thousands of families so far. In addition to free grocery, he also arranges permanent employment for these families, to help them become self sufficient. As a small means of employment, for example, he provides a sewing machine to the working women, who have worked as tailor entrepreneurs to set up clothes business at home.
He said every Sikh who does business or is employed puts aside one-tenth of his income every month. With this fund they help the poor and the deserving people, working on the common cause of humanity.
Zakia Bibi, a resident of Lytton Road, Lahore, said that her husband has been bedridden for a long time due to stroke. Sardar Jitindra Singh is not only treating her husband for free, but has also arranged ration for their family during Ramazan, which he dropped at her door during the holy month.

Another elder, Muhammad Ashraf, said the philanthropist had helped him establish a small shop which is now the source of livelihood for him and his children.
Residents say that people like Jitender Singh are doing what the government should do.
A local resident said those enjoying positions of authority take a picture even while giving a bag of flour, while those like Jitender Singh silently help the needy people.
Sardar Darshan Singh also organises Iftar and Langar for hundreds of people every day in Liberty Market.
He says that his table is for everyone who is hungry.
Labourers, unemployed, non-Muslims all sit on this table.

Once treated, the bears will be released into their natural and safe habitat.
The Four Paws team, comprising Director of Operations Dr Amir Khalil, Dr Ivanova, Dr Frank Goertz, and Velizer Engelof, arrived in Pakistan at the request of the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board to provide medical care for the animals.
Senior Provincial Minister Maryam Aurangzeb emphasised that only licensed vendors would be permitted to trade animals and birds. The Punjab government is also planning to establish a digital system for buying and selling animals and birds, ensuring compliance with legal regulations.

2,Model cemetery planned on Dharamshala land,"Hindu Council criticises move, ETPB official informs chairman","While the Evacuee Property Trust Board(EPTB) is carrying out operations on the order of the Supreme Court against illegal occupation of its properties across the country, the Punjab Local Government Department has decided to construct a model cemetery on more than 40 kanals of Hindu Dharamshala land in Gujranwala.
According to sources, the Board of Revenue has transferred the ownership of the land for the model graveyard.
The graveyard is being built on 40 kanal and 10 marla of land of the Hindu Dharamshala located in Khayali Shahpur in Gujranwala district, which is set to be inaugurated soon.
Officials of the EPTB said the land is under the management of the board and no government department can occupy the Waqf property. The Supreme Court has issued orders in this regard.
According to the board officials, it has come to their knowledge that the colonies department has illegally given the land to the local government department and there is a plan to build a model graveyard called Shehr-e-Khamoshan.
The Board of Revenue named the piece of land as Model Cemetery on January 12.
An official of the Gujranwala EPTB, Muhammad Javed, said he had not only informed the chairman of the board about the situation, but would also approach the Lahore High Court.
On the other hand, the Pakistan Hindu Council condemned this move and said the occupation of the Dharamshala would bring disrepute to the country. The council urged the government to take notice of the matter.
