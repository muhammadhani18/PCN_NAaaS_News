• Polling suggests that RFK Jr is  hurting Democrat candidate more than Republican challenger                     
Palm Beach (Flori­­da): Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign said a major fundraiser in Flori­da on Saturday raked in a massive $50.5 million as the former president seeks to replenish diminished coffers in his rematch against Democrat Joe Biden.
The event, his biggest fundraiser yet, is a much-needed boost for Trump, who has been routinely outraised by Biden and is in the midst of a financial squeeze due to ballooning lawyer fees and legal payouts from his criminal and civil court cases.
The dinner, hosted at billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson’s Palm Beach home, will allocate a portion of the money to be raised to a fundraising group that has spent tens of millions of dollars on Trump’s legal fees.
While Trump has struggled to get some major traditional Republican donors on board, he retains the support of some heavy hitters. Co-hosts on Saturday, for example, include hedge-fund investor Robert Mercer and his daughter and conservative activist Rebekah, investor Scott Bessent, and casino mogul Phil Ruffin, according to the fundraiser invitation.
“People are just wanting change. Rich people want it, poor people want it,” said Trump in comments ahead of the fundraiser, flanked by his wife Melania Trump, who has largely stayed away from the campaign trail so far.
Biden spokesperson Ammar Moussa said on social media site X that billionaires had flocked to Trump’s event due to tax preferences.  “The ultra-wealthy are really mad at Joe Biden for making them pay their fair share,” he posted.
Paulson has been floated by Trump as a potential Treasury secretary, according to two sources. Bessent has also been floated for the role, one of those sources said.
In a statement on Saturday, Paulson said the  “overwhelming support” at the dinner, which 100 guests were expected to attend, was a sign of enthusiasm for Trump.
Trump spoke for roughly 45 minutes, touching on the economy and the southern border with Mexico, fundraiser George Glass, Trumps former ambassador to Portugal, said.  “He also talked a lot about the unification of the party.”  The Republi­can candidate’s camp stressed the haul was double what Biden raised last month in an over $25 million star-studded fundraiser with Democratic former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
RFK Jr alarms Democrats
Armed  with the most storied surname in US politics, Robert F. Kennedy’s  wildcard shot for the presidency holds a clear and present danger for  Joe Biden’s hopes of a second term in the White House.
The  environmental law­yer and conspiracy theorist is boasting double-digit  support, and polling suggests that independent candidate  “RFK Jr” is  hurting the president more than Republi­can challenger Donald Trump.
Democrats  have learned to fear long-shot outsiders after George W. Bush and  Donald Trump won tight elections in 2000 and 2016, buoyed by Green Party  candidates leeching votes from Al Gore and Hillary Clinton.
“Hyper-polarisation  is the reason that a third-party candidate with name recognition is  such a threat at this time,” said Donald Nieman, a professor and  political analyst at New York state’s Binghamton University.
“There  are only six or seven truly competitive states, and some of those  states will be decided by as few as 10-20,000 votes. So anything that  siphons a group of usually reliable voters away could be a deciding  factor.” Kennedy’s popularity — he is pulling around 10 per cent in  election polling averages — complicates the strategy for the Biden  campaign, which is seeking to make November’s vote a binary choice  between the president and Trump.
Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic who  has spread misinformation downplaying the 2021 insurrection at the US  Capitol, has yet to secure ballot access in most of the country.

KIGALI: Rwanda on Sunday marked 30 years since the 1994 genocide that killed more than 800,000 men, women and children, mainly Tutsis but also moderate Hutus.
Here are some of the notable quotes as the tiny African nation commemorated the mass slaughter orchestrated by Hutu extremists targeting the Tutsi minority over 100 bloody days in 1994.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame
“Rwanda was completely humbled by the magnitude of our loss. And the lessons we learned are engraved in blood.”  “It was the international community which failed all of us, whether from contempt or cowardice”, President Kagame said addressing an audience that included several African heads of state and former US president Bill Clinton, who had called the genocide the biggest failure of his administration. 
US President Joe Biden
“We will never forget the horrors of those 100 days, the pain and loss suffered by the people of Rwanda, or the shared humanity that connects us all, which hate can never overcome.” 
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres
“This year, we remind ourselves of genocide’s rancid root: hate. To those who would seek to divide us, we must deliver a clear, unequivocal and urgent message: never again.” 
AU Commission head Moussa Faki Mahamat 
“No one, not even the African Union, can absolve itself of its inaction in the face of the chronicle of a genocide foretold. Let us have the courage to recognise this, and to take responsibility for it.” 
French President Emmanuel Macron
“We have all abandoned hundreds of thousands of victims to this infernal closed door. “When the phase of total extermination against the Tutsis began, the international community had the means to know and act. “France, which could have stopped the genocide with its Western and African allies, did not have the will.”
EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen 
“Today we mark 30 years since the genocide against the Tutsi. We honour the victims. And we praise Rwanda’s journey from darkness to hope, and from pain to progress. It’s an example for the world.” 
UN human rights chief Volker Turk
“The Rwanda genocide against the Tutsi was a clear reminder: Genocide doesn’t erupt from thin air — it follows years of normalised fear-mongering, hate and dehumanisation. “Governments must do everything in their power to combat hate, discrimination and other root causes before it’s too late.” 
HRW  executive director Tirana Hassan
“The genocide in Rwanda remains a stain on our collective conscience and, 30 years later, lessons can still be drawn from the actions — or lack thereof — of world leaders in the face of ongoing atrocities.”

2,Diplomatic staff  of Mexico leave Ecuador after embassy raid,"MEXICO CITY: Mexi­co’s diplomatic personnel were leaving Ecuador on Sunday, its foreign minister said, as the two...","MEXICO CITY: Mexi­co’s diplomatic personnel were leaving Ecuador on Sunday, its foreign minister said, as the two countries severed ties after Quito’s security forces stormed the Mexican embassy in a raid that prompted searing international rebukes.
“Our diplomatic staff are leaving everything in Ecuador and returning home with their heads held high... after the assault on our embassy,” said Foreign Minister Alicia Barcena on social network X, formerly Twitter.
She spoke after Spain and the European Union joined the United Nations chief and Latin American countries in condemning Quito for the raid — which it carried out in a bid to arrest former Ecuadoran vice president Jorge Glas, who was sheltering at the embassy.
Glas sought refuge there last December after an arrest warrant was issued against him for alleged corruption, in a move that Ecuadoran President Daniel Noboa’s government branded an  “illicit act.” Ecuadoran special forces equipped with a battering ram on Friday surrounded the embassy, and at least one agent scaled the walls, in an almost unheard-of raid on diplomatic premises that are considered inviolable sovereign territory.
On Saturday, Mexico’s foreign ministry had said that diplomatic personnel and their families would leave Ecuador the next day, adding that personnel from  “friendly and allied countries” would accompany them to the airport.
The group, which according to authorities is made up of 18 people, is traveling on a commercial airline to Mexico City after a military plane was ruled out due to the soaring tensions.
The officials and their families went to the Quito airport accompanied by the ambassadors of Ger­many, Panama, Cuba and Hond­uras, as well as the president of the Ecuador-Mexico Chamber, the Mexican Foreign Ministry said in a separate statement.
Mexico’s President And­res Manuel Lopez Obrador has called the raid a  “flagrant violation” of Mexi­co’s sovereignty, and said that he will file a complaint against Ecua­dor at the Inter­­national Court of Justice.
Mexico has also denounced  “physical violence” against head of mission Roberto Canseco, who was pushed to the ground by officers while trying to prevent the invasion. “How is it possible, it can’t be. This is crazy!” a shaken Canseco told local television after the raid.
Condemnation has poured in from regional governments across the political spectrum, including Nicaragua, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Peru and Venezuela.

3,People’s Liberation Army conducts military drills in South China Sea,Exercises take place days before President Joe Biden is due to hold summit with leaders of Philippines and Japan.,"BEIJING: China conducted military  “combat patrols” on Sunday in the disputed South China Sea, its army said, the same day as joint drills by the Philippines, the United States, Japan and Australia.
The announcement comes one day after defence chiefs from four countries including the Philippines — which has been engaged in several contentious maritime disputes with Beijing recently — said they would conduct joint drills in the area.
Beijing’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Southern Theater Command said it was organsing  “joint naval and air combat patrols in the South China Sea”. “All military activities that mess up the situation in the South China Sea and create hotspots are under control, “it said in a statement, in an apparent swipe at the other drills being held in the waters.” Further details about the Chinese military activities in the waterway were not announced.
The exercises take place days before US President Joe Biden is due to hold the first trilateral summit with the leaders of the Philippines and Japan. Top US officials have repeatedly declared the United States’  “ironclad” commitment to defending the Philippines against an armed attack in the South China Sea — to the consternation of Beijing.

Exercises take place days before President Joe Biden is due to hold summit with leaders of Philippines and Japan

China claims territorial sovereignty over nearly all of the South China Sea and has been increasingly assertive in the region in recent years. China’s Coast Guard said it had  “handled” a situation on Thursday at a disputed reef where several ships from the Philippines were engaged in  “illegal” operations.
“Under the guise of ‘protecting fishing’, Philippine government ships have illegally violated and provoked, organised media to deliberately incite and mislead, continuing to undermine stability in the South China Sea,” spokesman Gan Yu said.
“We are telling the Philippines that any infringement tactics are in vain,” Gan said, adding that China would  “regularly enforce the law in waters under (its) jurisdiction”.
Beijing has brushed aside competing territorial claims by several Southeast Asian countries in the South China Sea — a crucial route for global trade — as well as an international ruling that declared its stance baseless.
The drills conducted by the Philippines, United States, Japan and Australia are intended to  “(ensure) that all countries are free to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows,” US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a joint statement.
Named the  “Maritime Cooperative Activity”, the drills will include naval and air force units from all four countries, the joint statement said. There were no details in the statement on what the drills would precisely include. The Japanese embassy in Manila said in a statement that  “anti-submarine warfare training” would be included in the drills.
Last week, Australian warship HMAS Warramunga arrived at the Philippine island of Palawan, which faces the hotly contested waters. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos issued a strongly worded statement on March 28, vowing the country would not be  “cowed into silence, submission, or subservience” by China.
Talks between the Philippines and Japan for a defence pact that would allow the countries to deploy troops on each other’s territory were  “still ongoing”, a spokesman for the Philippine foreign affairs department told reporters last week. Manila already has a similar agreement with Australia and the United States.

4,What do scientists hope to learn from total solar eclipse in US?,"Total solar eclipses offer “incredible scientific opportunities,” Nasa Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy says.","WASHINGTON: When a rare total solar eclipse sweeps across North America on Monday, scientists will be able to gather invaluable data on everything from the Sun’s atmosphere to strange animal behaviors — and even possible effects on humans.
It comes with the Sun near the peak of its 11-year solar cycle, setting the stage for a breathtaking display: The corona will glow spectacularly from the Moon’s silhouette along the path of totality, a corridor stretching from Mexico to Canada via the United States.
Total solar eclipses offer  “incredible scientific opportunities,” Nasa Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy told a press conference this week about the celestial event.
The US space agency is one of the institutions at the ready for the eclipse, with plans to launch so-called  “sounding rockets” to study the effects on Earth’s upper atmosphere.
When the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun and blocks it, the elusive outermost edge of the Sun’s atmosphere, or corona, will be visible  “in a very special way,” Melroy said. “Things are happening with the corona that we don’t fully understand,” she said. 
The heat within the corona intensifies with distance from the Sun’s surface — a counterintuitive phenomenon that scientists struggle to fully comprehend or explain.
Solar flares, a sudden explosion of energy that releases radiation into space, take place in the corona as do solar prominences, enormous plasma formations that loop out from the Sun’s surface.

5,"Houthi rebels fire missiles at Israeli, British ships",US says its forces destroy a  mobile surface-to-air missile system and shoot down UAV over Red Sea,"DUBAI: Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Sunday said they targeted a  “British ship” and two “Israeli” vessels, after a British maritime security firm reported three separate attacks off Yemen’s coast in less than 24 hours.
Houthi rebels have launched dozens of missile and drone attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden since November, leading to retaliatory strikes by the United States against Houthi targets in Yemen. The rebels say their actions are in solidarity with Palestinians during Israel’s aggression against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The latest attacks come after a lull of several days in such incidents which have disrupted traffic along the vital Red Sea global trade route.
In a statement posted on social media on Sunday, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said the rebels had carried out five military operations during the previous 72 hours.

US says its forces destroy a  mobile surface-to-air missile system and shoot down UAV over Red Sea

They include a missile strike against a “British ship (Hope Island) in the Red Sea”.
Missiles also targeted what Saree described as two Israeli ships, MSC Grace F and MSC Gina.
Vessel tracking websites listed the Hope Island as travelling under a Marshall Islands flag and said it was in the Red Sea as of Friday. Two tracking sites also listed a vessel named MSC Grace F which they said sails under the Panamanian flag.
Marinetraffic.com listed MSC Gina as Panamanian-flagged and said it was last reported in the Gulf.The Houthi announcement came after British maritime security firm Ambrey said two ships were targeted off Yemen’s coast on Sunday, bringing to three the number of incidents it reported in less than 24 hours.
Ambrey said  “a vessel was targeted... southwest of Mukalla,” a Yemeni port city on the Gulf of Aden, without clarifying if it was hit or identifying its nationality. Earlier, it said a projectile fell near another ship southwest of Aden.
The Royal Navy’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Opera­tions (UKMTO) said that  “a missile impacted the water in close proximity” to the ship. “No damage to the vessel reported and crew reported safe,” it said.
Sunday’s attacks came hours after two missiles targeted a ship southwest of the Yemeni Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, according to both UKMTO and Ambrey.
One missile was intercepted by US-led coalition forces and the second missed the ship, according to UKMTO.
The weekend attacks came as Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian met senior Hou­thi official Mohamed Abdelsalam in Oman on Sunday.
Amir-Abdollahian praised the  “brave support of the Yemeni nation for the oppressed Palestinian nation,” according to Iran’s foreign ministry.
The United States, which leads a multinational flotilla intended to protect Red Sea shipping, has since mid-January launched repeated attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen. British warplanes have also taken part in several of the strikes.
US Central Command said on Sunday that its forces on Saturday destroyed a mobile surface-to-air missile system in Houthi-controlled territory, shot down an unmanned aerial vehicle over the Red Sea and  “successfully engaged and destroyed one inbound anti-ship missile”.
In a televised speech on Thursday, Houthi chief Abdul Malik al-Huthi said 37 people had been killed in more than 400 strikes by US and British forces on Yemen since January.
“During these operations and attacks, 37 martyrs died and 30 others were wounded,” he said, without specifying if the casualties were civilians or combatants.
The rebel leader vowed to continue strikes on Red Sea shipping, saying his fighters had launched 34 attacks over the past month.

6,"Global fact-checkers battle threats, financial perils","The most significant is raising funds to sustain operations, according to a new survey by the IFCN of 137 organisations.","WASHINGTON: From India and South Korea to Croatia and North Macedonia, fact-checking organisations battling an ever-rising tide of misinformation in a major election year are buffeted by legal threats, harassment and funding shortfalls.
Fact-checkers, largely under-resourced and increasingly under attack, have their work cut out this year as dozens of countries hold elections, a period when falsehoods typically explode.
Debunking fake political claims and hoaxes that threaten election integrity, likened by some researchers as a seemingly endless game of whack-a-mole, comes with a litany of challenges that are piling pressure on fact-checkers in a crucial year.
The most significant is raising funds to sustain operations, according to a new survey by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) of 137 organisations across 69 countries.
The Seoul National University (SNU) FactCheck Center, South Korea’s only local debunking platform, faces possible shutdown after its biggest donor — the search engine company Naver — pulled financial support last year.
Naver declined to comment on the reason, but the outfit’s director Chong Eun-ryung believes  “political pressure” from the ruling People Power Party was the  “biggest factor.” SNU FactCheck Center has been accused of bias by ruling party lawmakers, a charge it rejects.
The development follows the closure of another outfit, Fact-check Net, last year after the government cut off its funding.
‘Information warfare’
“Fact-checkers are facing growing amounts of misinformation with limited resources for reporting and publishing,” Angie Drobnic Holan, director of IFCN, said.
“There are also campaigns of online and legal harassment against fact-checkers from those who prefer more cutthroat information warfare, without checks based on evidence and logic.” The IFCN survey said about 72 per cent of organisations faced harassment, while many also reported physical and legal threats.
Croatian fact-checking website Faktograf.hr has been forced to invest in security measures after its staff received death threats and female reporters faced sexist insults, executive director Ana Brakus said.
A text message received by one staff member warned that his fingers would be  “cut off.”  “We had to find ways to deal with that kind of stress” without affecting the fact-checking mission, Brakus said, adding the organisation offered mental health support to its staff.
In India, home to the largest number of certified fact-checkers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi — tipped to win a third consecutive term in upcoming parliamentary elections — has been accused of stifling independent media.
Mohammed Zubair, co-founder of Alt News and a frequent target of government rebuke, continues to face legal threats after being briefly jailed in 2022 over accusations that he insulted a Hindi god in a tweet four years earlier.
During a fundraising drive on X, formerly Twitter, Zubair wrote Indian media organizations were being  “forced to censor themselves” and in some cases,  “becoming government mouthpieces.” 
‘Existential threats’
With their shoestring budgets, many fact-checkers must turn to external funding support to defend themselves against the  “existential threats” that lawsuits — often frivolous — present, the IFCN report said. In some cases, fact-checkers are themselves targeted by disinformation.
Truthmeter, the fact-checking service of the North Macedonia-based Metamorphosis Foun­dation, faced a sweeping smear campaign 
earlier this year after its fact-checks of Facebook posts prompted accusations that it was censoring content. 
The campaign, the group said in a note to readers, escalated into insults, slander and  “badly disguised calls for violence” against its staff. 
“We are fully aware that such disinformation campaigns, full of attacks, manipulations, threats and hate speech will continue, especially in 
the pre-election period,” it said, as North Macedonia gears up for the presidential race later this month.
Content moderation on social media has become a hot-button issue even in advanced economies such as the United States — which faces elections in November — with many users equating fact-checking with censorship.

7,Israeli planes hit Hezbollah sites in eastern Lebanon,"BEIRUT: Israel’s military said on Sunday its warplanes had struck Hezbollah sites in eastern Lebanon, where the...","BEIRUT: Israel’s military said on Sunday its warplanes had struck Hezbollah sites in eastern Lebanon, where the Iran-backed group has a strong presence, in retaliation for one of its drones being downed.
A source close to Hezbollah told a correspondent of this news agency in eastern Lebanon’s Baalbek region that the strikes targeted Janta and Sifri in the Bekaa Valley, around 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the closest Israeli frontier.
The Israeli military said on Telegram that  “fighter jets struck a military complex and three other terrorist infrastructure sites belonging to Hezbollah’s air defence network” in the region.
It said the strikes were  “in retaliation for the attack” in which an army  “drone was shot down” by a surface-to-air missile on Saturday. A source from Lebanon’s civil defence said there were no casualties.
Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged near-daily cross-border fire since October 7.
Hamas ally Hezbollah generally targets Israeli positions close to the border, while Israel has carried out deeper raids into Lebanese territory, also targeting commanders from the group.
Hezbollah announced it had shot down an Israeli Hermes 900 drone over Lebanese territory on Saturday evening, after initially identifying it as a Hermes 450.
On Sunday, the group said it fired “dozens of Katyusha rockets” at two Israeli bases  “in response to the enemy’s attacks on the Bekaa area”.
‘Hangar’ targeted
Sifri is located in the Bekaa Valley plain, while nearby Janta is an arid mountainous region closer to the border with Syria.
Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) said the target of the Israeli strikes in Sifri was a  “hangar”.
Israel launched similar strikes against Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa Valley in February after the group said it had shot down another Israeli drone.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech on Friday that his movement had not yet used its  “main” weapons, and reiterated that Hezbollah would cease its attacks only when the crisis in Gaza ends.
The cross-border hostilities have killed at least 359 people in Lebanon, mostly Hezbollah fighters, but also at least 70 civilians, according to a tally.
The fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people in southern Lebanon and in northern Israel, where the military says 10 soldiers and eight civilians have been killed.
On Saturday the Risala Scout association, which is affiliated with the Hezbollah-allied Amal movement and operates emergency teams in south Lebanon, said a rescuer had died. An official from the group said he had been wounded days earlier in south Lebanon.

8,Australia to appoint  special adviser to probe aid workers’ killing,The Australian government wants any probe by Israel to be monitored by its own adviser.,"SYDNEY: Australia has said it will appoint a special adviser to work with Israel as it demands transparency in an investigation into an air strike on Gaza that killed seven aid workers, including an Australian.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wants detailed answers as to how aid workers from the US-based World Central Kitchen were killed by Israeli forces last Monday.
The group included 43-year-old Australian natio­­nal Lalzawmi  “Zomi” Frankcom, as well as British, Palestinian, Polish and US-Canadian employees.
The Australian government wants any probe by Israel to be monitored by its own adviser, who Albanese expects will be named  “within the next twenty-four hours”.
“The events which led to Zomi Frankcom losing her life are unacceptable,” Albanese told reporters on Sunday. Australia will continue to seek clear information and transparency about the killings, he added,  “which is why we will be appointing an appropriate person to examine the details of what has occurred”.
His foreign minister Penny Wong has said information about the strike provided so far by Israel was insufficient and that the special adviser would monitor  “the appropriateness of the (investigation) process”.
Israel’s military said it fired two officers over the killing of the aid workers in Gaza, where humanitarian groups say famine is imminent.

9,Paramilitary attack on Sudan village kills 25,RED STATE: Sudanese paramilitary forces have killed at least 25 people in an attack on a village south of the ...,"RED STATE: Sudanese paramilitary forces have killed at least 25 people in an attack on a village south of the capital Khartoum, a local activists’ committee said on Sunday.
The Rapid Support Forces (RSF)  “attacked the village of Um Adam” 150 kilometres (93 miles) south of the city on Saturday, said a statement from the local resistance committee, one of many pro-democracy groups that coordinate aid.
Sudan’s war between the military, under army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, commanded by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, began last April 15.
Many thousands of people have been killed, including up to 15,000 in a single town in the war-ravaged Darfur region, according to United Nations experts.
The war has also displaced more than 8.5 million people, practically destroyed Sudan’s already fragile infrastructure and pushed the country to the brink of famine.
Saturday’s attack resulted in  “over 200 wounded with both serious and minor injuries, and more than 20 martyrs,” the statement said.
Five of the wounded succumbed to their injuries, bringing the death toll to 25, the committee said later on Sunday.
A medical source at the Manaqil hospital, 80 kilometres away, confirmed that they had  “received 200 wounded, some of whom arrived too late”.
“We’re facing a shortage of blood and we don’t have enough medical personnel,” he added.
More than 70 percent of Sudan’s health facilities are out of service, according to the UN, while those remaining receive many times their capacity and have meagre resources.
Both sides in the conflict have been accused of war crimes, including targeting civilians, indiscriminate shelling of residential areas and looting and obstructing aid.
Since taking over Al-Jazira state just south of Khartoum in December, the RSF has laid siege to and attacked entire villages such as Um Adam.
By March, at least 108 villages and settlements across the country had been set on fire and  “partially or completely destroyed”, the UK-based Centre for Information Resilience has found.

10,WCK founder condemns Israeli ‘war against humanity’ in Gaza,"Jose Andres compares Benjamin Netanyahu to Vladimir Putin during interview with ABC’s ""This Week""."," 

Chef Jose Andres

WASHINGTON: World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres on Sunday called for an independent probe into the Israeli strike that killed seven of his staff in Gaza, and warned that the crisis had become a  “war against humanity itself.”
Speaking about his firsthand experience working in war-torn Ukraine, where  “entire towns” have been destroyed, the head of the US-based charity also compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“This investigation and many others should be done right, should be done in an independent way,” Andres said in an emotional interview with ABC’s  “This Week.”
“This doesn’t seem like a war against terror. This doesn’t seem anymore like a war about defending Israel,” he said.  “It really, at this point, seems like a war against humanity itself.”

Jose Andres compares Benjamin Netanyahu to Vladimir Putin during interview with ABC’s ‘This Week’

Andres is a celebrity chef in the United States, and the White House has called the killing of the aid workers from his charity a  “catalyst” for sterner calls by US President Joe Biden for Israel to curtail the killing of civilians and aid workers, and improve the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.
Andres called the new aid routes a  “first step” and said he supports Israel’s right to defend itself, but questioned why the United States was supplying weapons to a country that is  “killing American citizens who are humanitarians.”
The Israeli Defence Forces have insisted that their killing on Monday of the World Central Kitchen workers in Gaza was a  “tragic mistake.” Three Britons, a US-Canadian dual national, a Pole, an Australian and a Palestinian were killed when the WCK convoy, whose route was cleared with the IDF, was repeatedly struck.
In its investigation, the Israeli military said an armed man climbed on the roof of one of the trucks and  “started firing his weapon,” leading to suspicions that the  “convoy had been hijacked by Hamas.”
When asked about the Israeli report’s findings, Andres questioned the narrative, and charged that Israel was targeting anything that  “seems” to move, and has been doing so  “for too long.”
“I want to thank, obviously, the IDF, for doing such a quick investigation,” Andres said, adding that it didn’t go deep enough.
“We need more information. We need to see better quality videos,” he said.
“What were the conversations, the radio conversations, between the different officers and soldiers in charge?” “The perpetrator cannot be investigating himself,” he added. Calling the killings  “unforgivable,” Andres also compared the destruction in Gaza to that in Ukraine.
“I’ve seen firsthand what has been happening in Ukraine, entire towns and cities being wiped out by Russia and by Putin. What Prime Minister Netanyahu is doing is exactly the same,” he said.
