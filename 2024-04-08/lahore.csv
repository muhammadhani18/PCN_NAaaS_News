0,Punjab govt engages oncologists from abroad for proposed cancer hospital,35 specialists already working on first cancer hospital in public sector.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government’s recently notified high-profile committee of 35 senior cancer specialists from all over the province has expanded the scope of work and engaged senior oncologists from the USA, UK and other countries for establishing the first public 450-bed cancer hospital in Lahore with initial estimated cost of Rs35bn.
It is said to be the first committee, containing the maximum number of specialists (oncologists), formed for setting up the hospital. They have been taken from public and private hospitals of Punjab, including Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital Lahore.
Prominent among them include Prof Ijaz Masood from the Nishtar Medical University Multan, Dr Rab Nawaz Maikan, Dr Zeeshan, Dr Nauman from the Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Oncology Lahore (INMOL), Dr Arif Jamshed, Dr Najma from the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, Dr Amjad Zafar from the Allama Iqbal Medical College Lahore, Lt Col Mehreen Ali Khan from the CMH Rawalpindi, Dr Tariq Maqsood from the Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Institute Rawalpindi, Prof Dr Waseem Hayat Khan from the Cancer Care Hospital Manawan, Lahore, Prof Khalid Bashir from the National Hospital Lahore and Prof Mona Aziz from the Shaikh Zayed Hospital Lahore.
“In continuation of the department’s notification, the competent authority has been pleased to co-opt the oncologists/experts from public and private sector for seeking opinion/input on the draft feasibility report prepared by the committee,” reads the notification.

35 specialists already working on first cancer hospital in public sector

It states that the experts shall consider the terms of references while reviewing the draft as per their titled specialties.
Speaking to Dawn, many oncologists said that initially it would be a 450-bed cancer hospital that would house multiple departments at Valencia Housing Society Lahore. They said that according to a recent report of the World Health Organisation (WHO), nearly 118,631 people had lost their lives to different types of cancer during 2022 in Pakistan and they included 58 934 men and 59 697 women.
In Pakistan, the risk of developing cancer before turning 75 was calculated to be 11pc while the risk of dying from cancer by the same age was found to be 7.6pc. The top five types of cancer among Pakistani women were found to be breast, lip oral cavity, ovary, cervix uteri and oesophagus. The top five cancers among men were lip oral cavity, lung, colorectum, prostate and oesophagus. Breast cancer was the leading cause of death (15,522 – 18.6pc) followed by oral cancer (10,181– 5.9pc) and lung cancer (8,307 – 5.3pc) in the country in 2022.
During the previous government of the PTI in Punjab, the then health minister Prof Dr Yasmin Rashid had announced construction of a new cancer hospital at a newly proposed teaching institute, namely the Lahore General Hospital II near Arfa Karim Tower along Ferozepur Road.
Earlier, during his last tenure in Punjab as chief minister, Shehbaz Sharif had also made claims regarding establishment of a new 200-bed cancer hospital near the PKLI in DHA Lahore. However, successive governments abandoned the plans due to certain reasons, one of them requirement of huge funds for the highly expensive treatment and purchase of medical and surgical equipment.
 
 

The experts said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz came up with the new project and she seemed to be serious in materialising it as was evident from the formation of multiple sub-committees of health and medical experts from various specialities.
It was the 4th meeting of the abovementioned 35-member committee and the first one in which the expat Pakistani oncologists were also engaged through a video link conference on Saturday night.
An official said that currently there were hardly a few oncology units in the major teaching hospitals of Punjab, including a department at the Mayo Hospital Lahore, which was not fully functional. He said the Nishtar Hospital Multan was the only institute in the province, housing the largest facility for the cancer patients. Established by the senior oncologist of the Nishtar Medical University Prof Dr Ijaz Masood, the centre was catering to the needs of the cancer patients coming from the south Punjab and other parts of the province.
 
 

During the committee’s meeting, the official said, the Pakistani oncologists briefed Pakistani expat cancer specialists about the initiative of CM Maryam Nawaz, saying she had allocated around 300 kanal land at the Valencia Housing Society of Lahore for the 450-bed hospital.
They were further briefed about the ToRs to review the draft feasibility report and were asked to provide input while reviewing the scope and draft design prepared by IDAP of services linked with the specialty concerned and proposed capacity (beds/ service delivery space) for the specialty, keeping in view the estimated burden of disease and the given bed strength of the hospital in the initial phase.
In light of the increased patient load, the opinion on the future expansion of the specialty/supra-specialty would also be solidified by the committee.
The committee shall review the list of equipment keeping in view the diagnostic/ curative/ rehabilitative services to be offered by the specialty and it shall ascertain the areas of potential linkages with the other specialties for improved service delivery and patient experience.

5,PML-N leaders out to occupy UAF land: VC,"‘MPA Nagra, Raja Riaz trying to create law & order situation on Eid’; both reject VC’s claim","TOBA TEK SINGH: University of Agriculture Faisalabad’s Vice Chancellor Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan has written a letter to the Faisalabad deputy commissioner and CPO, accusing PML-N MPA Zafar Iqbal Nagra of trying to occupy university’s 19 kanal land in the guise of Anjum-e-Data Ganj Buksh Ali Hajvary, also known as Darbar Baba Qaim Sain. 
The land was returned to the university in August 2019 as a consequence of an order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2001.
The VC said using his political influence, the MPA was again trying to occupy the UAF land -- previously  in the name of Janazgah and now as Eidgah. He said the university had kept the Janazgah intact since 2019 while there had been no Eidgah or any Eid event during the UAF possession.
He said Nagra and former MNA Raja Riaz Ahmad were attempting to create a law and order situation by misleading the neighborhood that the government had allowed the use of university land as Eidgah.

‘MPA Nagra, Raja Riaz trying to create law & order situation on Eid’; both reject VC’s claim

He said the entire exercise was aimed at grabbing the university land for personal gains. He claimed that Zafar Iqbal Nagra and his family had collected at least Rs 21.568 million as rent by illegally occupying the land since the decision of the Supreme Court in 2001 to 2019. He said Nagra did not belong to PP-109 (which covers the UAF as well). 
The VC requested the DC and CPO to recover the ill-gotten amount from Nagra and use force to prevent illegal occupation by miscreants in the name of Eidgah.
He requested them to apprise the Chief Minister office that illegal occupation of public property by an MPA of the ruling party would bring a bad name to the PML-N. He said to further the cause of protecting university property, we had also moved a petition in the LHC.
UAF spokesman Dr Jalal Arif appealed to the citizens to support truth and don’t take law in their hands.
MPA Nagra claimed that the land in question was not owned by the UAF. As per the revenue record, it was provincial government property in the possession of the ADGBH and used for Janazgah and Eidgah since 1965.
He said on his request CM Maryam Nawaz had formed a three-members committee headed by senior member board of revenue who had convened a meeting on April 4 where, he (Nagra), VC and Raja Riaz were also present. It was decided in the meeting that the UAF would allow offering of Eid prayers at the land but it (UAF) had got a stay order from the LHC.
He said even if the stay remained enforced, “we and hundreds will obey court order and offer Eid prayers on the Ghulam Muhammadabad main road.
He hoped that revenue board would give verdict in favour of the ADGBH.

6,Punjab notes: Naseer’s stories and Ibne Hasan’s writings,"Which is older, poetry or storytelling? It seems both are equally old as there is no evidential certainty as to ...","Which is older, poetry or storytelling? It seems both are equally old as there is no evidential certainty as to which is older.  
Poetry, people believe, has been pre-eminent. Reasons are not unfathomable; structure of poetry in the absence of recording machines helped people to retain its contents in memory. Secondly, happenings and history were preserved in poetic genres for the same reason. Most of the scriptures have employed verse for its moral, spiritual and metaphysical expressions.  
Invention of printing press gradually but surely transformed the entire scene. As the availability of books became common, fiction developed at a rapid pace leaving poetry far behind. Books of fiction monopolise all the front shelves of book shops and poetry has to be dug out from behind the stacks and dusted off. 
Punjabi fiction had its beginnings in the 19th century and pioneers were mostly Sikh writers. Muslim and Hindu Punjabis schooled in colonial educational institutions were generally little pushed about their mother language as they had in their false consciousness declared Urdu and Hindi their mother languages respectively. History has rarely seen such a massive lie spoken by such large groups. But things are gradually changing as the writers realise the crucial significance of writing in their own language this side of the Punjab.  
Among the contemporary fiction writers Naseer Ahmed has a prominent place. He is a poet as well. But what distinguishes him from others is his fiction which is as fresh as it is provocative. His latest book of short stories Ki Paatar da Jivana has been published by Ask Publications, Lahore. It has 14 stories on diverse experiences and themes. Some of his powerful stories are symbolic and have metaphorical dimensions. But surprisingly they stay clear of impotent abstraction which marks many of modern stories which pretend to be avant-garde. They effortlessly evoke the nuanced presence of the concrete. Semblance of normality in abnormality seems eerily surrealistic. In his stories what is worn out suddenly comes alive with its multiple edges. Our repeated interaction with the worn out that makes it dead for us is subverted by Naseer Ahmed by skilfully scratching its veneer and showing us how it’s organically linked with the things that constitute our actual life.
His “Angootha (A Thumb Toe)”, is a breathtakingly profound story. A thumb toe tells us the story of a man, of life lived and wasted in a society sternly driven by power hierarchy and class distinctions. It’s a tale of the wretched of the earth and of those who create wretchedness on the face of earth. It’s so vivid and magical that one feels as if one has been transformed into a toe and experiences the world from its perspective.
“Zaat di Choohi (A Mean Rate)” is another story in the similar mode that amazes you and shakes you. A female rate enters a dark and dingy temple and takes shelter in an idol to discover that it is made of dough. When she pecks at it a part of it falls. She observes what happens in the temple and around it; how caretaker’s daughter gets pregnant by nebulous young flutist and how people react when the secret is leaked. It is an expose of the hollowness of the world we have built with meticulous care and firm conviction. His stories in realistic mode are no less revealing of social sordidness that is an integral part of the sanitised space of the rich.  
His story “Dozakh (Hell)” narrates the plight of a maid, a mere child, who is treated as much less than a human for being what she is, a maid. How she is forced to do chores and starved empathetically at a family wedding function makes the entire social and moral edifice come tumbling down over your head.  
Poet and fiction writer Riffat Abbas rightly points out in his preface that the author while painting his creative wonderland is firmly committed to the social and cultural responsibility of a writer. “Naseer Ahmed’s stories move through difficult passes and show that weaving a story is more of a social and political endeavour than a mere creative pleasure,” he writes.  
The best literary quality of Naseer Ahmed’s narratives is expressed in his being economical with the language, a virtue most of our writers lack. Saccharine expression in a florid language is what generally mars writings in our languages. There are no circumlocutions as far as his stories are concerned displaying his developed sense of language. Don’t miss these stories. They are born of a universal humanist vision. 
Ibne Hasan was a teacher and academic with deep interest in philosophy, politics, and literature but first and foremost he was a Marxist who envisaged a future society free of class exploitation driven by ideals of rationality and human equality. So many in the generation that mounted the social stage in 1960s shared such a dream of universal redemption that they believed was inevitable in a transformative historical process. That it proved little more than a chimera in a world dominated by capitalism is a sad story of a grand human plan coming to naught. But it did its bit in creating an alternative vision of society, at least at the level of imagination.  
Ibne Hasan died in 2012. A collection of his writings titled “Adab aur Mauruzi Haqiqat” has been published posthumously by Aks Publications, Lahore. The book has been edited by Sibgat Wain, his student, colleague and friend. His introduction traces the upward trajectory of Ibne Hasan’s intellectual development but in a slightly polemical manner. Overwhelmed by emotions for his guru, he makes a hyperbolic claim: “…I could find no one who could write a befitting preface to his works. That’s why I thought I should do it myself.” Well, what can one say? One hopes that people other than the editor would be able to understand and critique his writings. The book is divided into two parts. The first one is “Falsafiyan Pussmanzar (A Philosophical perspective) that deals with the thoughts of Kant, Hegel, Marx and Lenin. The second part Jamaliyat (Aesthetics) touches diverse subjects of aesthetics, literature and culture. Ibne Hasan’s oeuvre is a valuable addition to the repository of Marxist writings which have dwindled in number in the last three decades. The tome is for the serious readers who want to look at the world critically.  — soofi01@hotmail.com

The historical theatre will be renovated at an estimated cost of Rs391.8m. Built in 1940 at a hillock in the then Lawrence Gardens, the theatre had its first cosmetic renovation in 1982 when the main staircase for the visitors was added to its structure.

With the efforts of GD (Guru Dutt) Sondhi, the then principal of Government College, Lahore, the theatre was constructed to stage plays and hold other cultural activities. It has been a nursery of performing and visual artistes, including Sultan Rahi, Qavi Khan, Sadequain, Irfan Khoosat, Sohail Ahmed and a number of others.  
The officials concerned said the renovated Open Air Theatre would have facilities of reception, recording room, music room, studios, toilets and lift for the disabled, patients and old citizens. The ground floor will have a multi-purpose room, green room, lobby, gazebos and seating area for visitors. 
The first floor will have directors’ rooms, office rooms, electricity room, multi-purpose room and toilets. The second floor would have a store /workshop, make-up rooms, green room, stage room, toilets, open restaurant and kitchen. 
Punjab Council of the Arts (PCA) Executive Director Dr Syed Bilal Haider told Dawn that while renovating the Open Air theatre as per requirements of modern times, its historical and special premises would be maintained in every way. 
He added that the open air theatre would attract the public and tourists like other historical buildings of Lahore and a wall of fame would also be decorated to pay tribute to the legendary artistes who had performed in it in the past. 
Mr Haider added that the Open Air Theatre was handed over to Punjab Council of the Arts in 1975, acknowledging its mandate for the preservation of culture and promotion of art in Punjab.

PHHSA chairman Shahzad Ali Malik said that the association was committed to enhancing the quality of seeds and combating the detrimental activities of the seed mafia, which continue to inflict substantial losses on farmers and agricultural production.”PHHSA’s genuine demand as a stakeholder in the NSDRA underscores the importance of industry representation in regulatory bodies tasked with overseeing seed development. By participating in decision-making processes, the association aims to contribute its expertise and insights towards the formulation of effective policies and regulations that safeguard the interests of farmers,” he said in a statement here on Sunday.  
Mr Malik, who pioneered hybrid rice seed three decades ago, said one of the primary objectives behind PHHSA’s advocacy for representation is to address the pervasive issue of counterfeit and substandard seeds proliferated by unscrupulous elements. These nefarious activities not only deceive unsuspecting farmers but also undermine the integrity of the agricultural sector, leading to significant economic losses and jeopardising food security, he added. 
Calling for action against the seed mafia, Mr Malik said through coordinated efforts with law-enforcement agencies and relevant authorities, stringent measures must be implemented to identify and prosecute the individuals involved in the illicit trade of adulterated seeds. “Such decisive action is essential to deter potential offenders and safeguard the livelihoods of farmers who rely on quality seeds for optimal crop yields.” 
He said that by fostering a culture of transparency and accountability within the seed industry, stakeholders can collectively strive towards a more resilient and sustainable agricultural ecosystem.

The six nominated journalists included a senior journalist Nadeem Javedani, Faisalabad Press Club Vice President Mian Munawar Iqbal, joint secretary Saghir Sanwal and former press club general secretary Zafran Sarwar. Thirty journalists remained unidentified.
