2,Rescued bear undergoes surgery,Vets complete medical check-ups of eight furry creatures at wildlife rehab centre,"The Four Paws veterinarians, in collaboration with the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) rescue team, conducted veterinary checks on eight Asiatic bears which were rescued from various parts of Punjab.
This included castration of male bears, dental treatment, dressing of wounds, and removal of infected teeth for all three bears.
These bears are currently housed in the rescue and rehabilitation centre at the old zoo site in Islamabad. With this final round of treatment on Sunday, all eight Asiatic bears (six males and two females) have completed their treatment and surgical procedures.
The Four Paws team members, including Dr Frank Goeritz, Dr Amir Khalil, Dr Marina Ivanova, Velizar Angelov, Ahmad Badal, and Pia Einheimler, along with IWMB's Dr Usman, Sakhawat, Sana Raja, and Aneela, have been on-site for three days, providing essential medical, clinical, and surgical care to these animals recently confiscated from various cities in Punjab.
Dr Amir Khalil, leading the Four Paws team, held meetings with IWMB's chairperson Rina Saeed, board members, and local officials, assuring the group's assistance in constructing a sanctuary for bears and providing expertise in this regard.
Several cases of maltreatment of Asiatic bears have been reported in Pakistan, where they are subjected to torture, made to dance, and forced into fights for monetary gain by their captors.
The animals were rescued from different cities in Punjab based on the special instructions and interest of Marriyum Aurangzeb, senior minister of the Punjab. Many of them had wounds, pulled-out nails, and broken teeth.
There are still three or four bears rescued by the Punjab Wildlife Department from Sargodha and Bahawalnagar, ready to be housed and treated in Islamabad once transferred.
Owais Awan, Advocate counsel for IWMB, emphasised the need for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Punjab Wildlife Department for the handover of these animals. He stated that since the Four Paws team is in Islamabad, the sooner they are shifted for treatment and checkup, the better.
The Four Paws spokesperson mentioned that the global animal welfare group performed various medical procedures, including ultrasound, vaccinations, anti-parasite treatments, micro-chipping, claw trimming, and teeth treatment. One female bear named Barfi underwent a life-saving dental procedure, and a male bear named Bhaloo had a wound on his neck treated and three teeth surgically removed due to inflammation and abscess. Another male bear, Cuckoo, received dental treatment for five teeth due to issues from illegal captivity as a dancing bear.

3,Zakat beneficiaries left in lurch ahead of Eid,Four DZCs in Pindi division have yet to receive funds from the Punjab government,"Around 19,000 poor families may not be able to receive the Eidul Fitr gift package from the four District Zakat Committees (DZCs) in the Rawalpindi division owing to the paucity of public funds as the Punjab government and the relevant authority have yet to release funds.
Officials claim that a severe economic and financial crisis is preventing the government from releasing funds for the destitute. Officials of DACs have started advising beneficiaries to wait till Eid.
Since 1980, Eid gifts ranging from Rs10,000 to Rs12,000 are distributed among eligible Zakat recipients in Punjab in the last 10 days of Ramazan every year. This amount includes the quarterly instalment of Rs9,000 and an Eid gift of Rs3,000.
Each year, from the 20th to the 25th of Ramazan, financial assistance in the form of Eid gifts is distributed among all eligible poor families, orphans, widows, and divorced women through Easy Paisa. These families rely on state funds to celebrate the colours of Eid.
The DZCs sent letters to both the Punjab government and the competent authority on the 1st of Ramazan, requesting financial assistance, however, they have not received any response yet. Furthermore, no meetings have been scheduled for the local Zakat Committees and DZCs regarding the provision of Eid gift financial assistance.
Sources in the District Zakat Council (DZC) Rawalpindi confirmed that there is no information available regarding the Eid package for Zakat beneficiaries. There is complete silence as even the letters and reminders sent for funds have not received any response yet, they added. The sources further added that if the funds are received today, the majority of the beneficiaries will receive gifts after Eid.
Hundreds of widows, orphans, and deserving families are forced to leave the Zakat Council office without cash every day. They are seen lamenting the government for ignoring their miseries and depriving them of Eid celebrations.
The widow and mother of five, Ayesha Begum says the delight of Eid has always been amplified by the tradition of receiving Eid gifts each year, however, this year her hope has been shattered.
Ayesha and several other women have been frequently visiting the Zakat Council office since the beginning of Ramazan, but return empty-handed with a glimmer of hope. They have urged the Punjab chief minister to promptly disburse the financial assistance from the Zakat Fund.
Office-bearers yet to be appointed
Separately, the chairmen and members of the District Zakat Committees in 43 districts across Punjab have not been appointed yet. The Rawalpindi district alone has 1,166 local zakat committees, while each district in the province has between 750 to 1,400 local zakat committees at the union council level. However, the chairmen and members of these local zakat committees have not been appointed.
The organisational structure at the division, district, tehsil and local union council levels is currently in limbo. At the district level, Deputy Commissioner Administrators and Local Zakat Committees are run by the government officers of grade 16 as Administrators.

5,"Swiss tourist, aides robbed at gunpoint","Robbery sparks territorial dispute between capital, Taxila police","A foreign female tourist and five of her Pakistani companions fell prey to an armed robbery while exploring the cultural richness of the federal capital while hiking on a path to Taxila.
The distressing incident unfolded as a group comprising the foreign national was on the way to Taxila when the armed robbers intercepted them.
The aftermath of the robbery sparked a territorial dispute between the Taxila and Golra police, prompting swift action from the Islamabad Operations DIG.
According to police sources, the foreign tourist and her Pakistani friends parked their vehicles in Shah Allah Ditta before setting off on a hike towards a Stupa in Taxila. Armed robbers, whose identities remain unknown, ambushed the group, held them at gunpoint, and confiscated their mobile phones at Mouza Parache Khurman. Subsequently, they forced the victims to withdraw Rs120,000 from an ATM before releasing them.
The tourists were reportedly kept in wrongful confinement near the Stupa, falling within the Taxila police station's jurisdiction. However, their vehicles were parked near Golra police station at Shah Allah Ditta. The foreign lady is believed to be from Switzerland, as per available information.
A Golra police station officer highlighted that the hiking trail near Shah Allah Ditta village is popular among tourists exploring Taxila's Buddhist culture. Tourists typically return in the evening after visiting the Buddha statues and cultural sites. Unfortunately, the area known as ""Parache Khurman"" along this route is notorious for frequent thefts targeting tourists. Although this area falls under Taxila police station's jurisdiction in Rawalpindi, Golra police often handle such incidents due to the lack of attention from Rawalpindi authorities.
Regarding the absence of a police patrolling system along this vulnerable route shared by federal and Taxila police jurisdictions, aimed at protecting tourists from criminals, including those believed to hide in Mauza Parache Khurman, the officer confirmed the lack of such security measures. However, Golra police assured that they would register a case and apprehend the culprits responsible for the robbery.
This incident underscores the urgent need for enhanced security measures and collaborative efforts between police stations to ensure the safety of tourists exploring historical and cultural sites in the region.

6,Officials clash over ‘unwarranted interference’,"Video showcasing heated confrontation between cops, excise officials goes viral","Tensions escalated between officials of the Excise, Taxation, and Narcotics Department and the police over allegations of harassment directed at liquor permit holders leaving a five-star hotel on Mall Road in Rawalpindi.
The incident, which unfolded in public and was captured on video, quickly went viral on social media, showcasing a heated confrontation between the two agencies.
The video depicts police personnel halting vehicles outside the hotel and reportedly harassing liquor permit holders. This public display of discord prompted swift action from SSP Operations Hafiz Kamran Asghar, who suspended two officials involved in the incident and initiated internal investigations.
According to sources, permit holders voiced their grievances against alleged harassment by police officers who intercepted vehicles leaving the hotel after patrons purchased liquor with valid permits. The checkpoint, established opposite the private hotel on Mall Road, became a focal point of contention as permit holders accused the police of unwarranted interference.
During one such operation, Civil Lines police station personnel stopped a vehicle outside the hotel. When confronted by a woman excise inspector and her team, the police maintained their position on conducting checks, leading to a verbal confrontation captured in the video.
Witnesses at the scene claimed that police officers were unnecessarily recording details from the permits and causing inconvenience to permit holders.
In the video, the excise inspector questioned the authority of the police to independently conduct checks without joint oversight, as previously agreed between the two departments for addressing any suspected illegal activities. The exchange highlighted discrepancies in procedures and responsibilities between the police and Excise departments.
Further complicating the situation, allegations surfaced regarding the filing of a wrongful FIR against an elderly individual unrelated to the hotel incident. This accusation, along with ongoing tensions, underscored the strained relationship between the two agencies.
ETO Excise Gul Sher clarified that non-Muslim permit holders, especially during the Easter festival, are permitted to possess and transport alcohol with valid permits. However, instances of alleged harassment and misconduct by certain police officers led to formal complaints and internal investigations within the Excise department.
In response to the video and escalating tensions, SSP Operations Hafiz Kamran Asghar emphasised the primary duty of police personnel in crime prevention and security enforcement. Any deviations from these responsibilities, as evidenced in the video, would result in stringent departmental actions against the involved officials.

9,"‘Autism affects speech, movement and behaviour’",Challenges posed by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) highlighted on occasion of World Day of Children’s Nervous Diseases,"Head of Psychiatry Department Ayub Medical Complex (AMC) Abbottabad Professor Dr Aftab Alam Khan has highlighted the challenges posed by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) on the occasion of the World Day of Children’s Nervous Diseases.
He expressed these views while addressing an awareness seminar at AMC. Dr Khan said ASD, a mental developmental disorder affecting speech, movements, and behaviours, has seen a significant rise in prevalence over the past two decades.
Citing data from the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr Khan noted that one in every 100 children globally is diagnosed with ASD, with a particularly rapid increase observed in some regions such as the United States, where one in 35 children is affected.
While the exact causes of ASD remain unidentified, the medic pointed to several factors including genetic predisposition, advanced parental age, prenatal exposure to certain medications, and environmental influences.
He highlighted the profound impact of ASD, noting that 40% of affected children struggle with speech, with many exhibiting delayed speech development until around 18 to 25 months of age.
Emphasising the importance of early diagnosis, the head of the Psychiatry department stated that most cases are identified by the age of three, underscoring the need for timely intervention and support.
Despite the absence of specific medications and treatments, Dr Khan stressed the potential for positive outcomes through early diagnosis and tailored therapies, which can help alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life for affected individuals.
In light of these challenges, he urged governmental efforts to establish specialised autism centres, ensuring equitable access to treatment facilities for all residents of Pakistan.
