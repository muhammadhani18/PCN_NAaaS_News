0,Auto industry seeks growth via diversification,"Local companies pivot to new products to curb imports, build economic resilience","Amidst the challenges faced by the auto industry, several local companies have embarked on diversification strategies to mitigate losses and tap into new revenue streams.
With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent import bans, numerous companies within the auto sector, also known as the engineering industry, have pivoted towards manufacturing a diverse range of products to serve both national interests and their own profitability.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Auto Sector Expert and Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM) former chairman and Director of Mehran Commercial Enterprises, Mashood Khan said, “They can deploy their resources--- existing technologies to reduce the swelling import bill and develop local products while benefiting locals and the country. We should continue the diversification process and form a cluster of Small Medium-Sized Enterprises with a view to manufacturing a host of products and try our best to make brands from within the country catering to both the local and international markets.”
He said the auto industry, which is, in fact, an arm of the engineering industry, has been operational for more than 35 years, and can utilise its machinery and expertise to help various industries such as textile, pharmaceuticals, leather, chemical, and others by building small machines (or parts) that are currently being imported. He cautioned, however, that the industry may continue to face challenges in 2024 as it struggled with operations disruptions in the preceding year.
One such company that has successfully diversified is the Alsons Group, boasting over 70 years of experience in precision engineering and manufacturing experience in the automotive, aerospace, defence items, energy, oil-cum-gas, lighting, and medical device industries of the country.
“Diversification is imperative as the automotive industry continues to experience fluctuations. While our core business revolves around auto parts, we’re expanding our product range to mitigate losses and cater to high-demand innovative products,” stated Akbar Allana, Director of Alsons Group.

He said now the group has been manufacturing defence items, a complete range of lighting products, auto parts, various assemblies, fixtures CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) medical devices, state-of-the-art electro-mechanical ventilator including a range of ventilation, auto lock, accuracy, user-friendly, waveforms display, touchscreen LCD, trolley, and humidifier option.
He explained that initially established as a clock manufacturing company in 1953, the company ventured into producing timing devices and artillery fuses after being approached by the Pakistan Army in 1965. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, it had fully transitioned into diversifying its product range.
The group has since become a key supplier of defence products to Pakistan Ordnance Factories (POF) and has expanded its reach globally, exporting to countries including Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, and others. Its exports are valued at approximately $6 to $7 million annually.
Similarly, Sherani Engineering, a company with three decades of experience, has diversified into manufacturing welding jigs, armoured vehicle jigs, molds, and machine fixtures, among other products.
Director Saad Sherani of Sherani Engineering highlighted the pivotal role his company plays in meeting the demands of both local and international markets with a diverse product range. Additionally, he outlined the company's expansion into manufacturing jigs for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), thus enhancing its portfolio. Sherani Engineering also specializes in producing dies, molds, and fixtures for both internal and external clients, further solidifying its position as a versatile industry leader.

1,Major AI chips designer chases $30b market,Nvidia building new unit to design chips for cloud computing firms,"Nvidia is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial intelligence processors, according to sources familiar with the company’s plans.
The dominant global designer and supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market for custom AI chips and to protect itself from the growing number of companies interested in finding alternatives to its products.
The Santa Clara, California-based company currently controls about 80% of the market for high-end AI chips, a position that has sent its market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023. Its customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of Nvidia chips to compete in the rapidly emerging generative AI sector. Nvidia’s H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalised, all-purpose AI processor for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. This helps reduce energy consumption, and can potentially shrink the cost and time to design.

Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to rival firms such as Broadcom and Marvell Technology, according to the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak publicly. 
“If you’re really trying to optimise on things like power, or optimise on cost for your application, you can’t afford to go drop an H100 or A100 in there,” said Greg Reichow, General Partner at venture capital firm Eclipse Ventures. “You want to have the exact right mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need.”

2,Stocks slump over poll result delay,"Benchmark KSE-100 index loses 1,200.12 points, settles at 62,943.75","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) was rattled on Friday by the unusual delay in announcement of election results and growing political uncertainty, which led to a plunge of 1,200 points in the KSE-100 index and deterred investors from building their portfolios.
Uncertainty gripped the market as initial, unofficial results of general elections trickled in, which were not in line with some pre-poll surveys and predictions.
In the morning, soon after trading began, the index plunged rapidly, losing more than 2,000 points in the first few minutes. However, the market quickly recovered and recouped more than half of the losses before midday.
In a major development, Moody’s Investors Service asserted that timely announcement of election results, leading to a smooth formation of a new government, would reduce political uncertainty, which was crucial for the country that was facing very challenging macroeconomic conditions.
Later, the central bank reported that its foreign currency reserves decreased by $173 million to $8.04 billion due to debt repayments.
Despite making a significant recovery, following some clarity about the outcome of elections, the KSE-100 index ended the day with heavy losses.
“Stocks fell across the board on political uncertainty amid delay in general election results,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Moody’s rating concerns over political instability, policy uncertainty for a country facing challenging macroeconomic conditions, fragile balance of payments and high inflation remain the key driving factors. Investor concerns over surging industrial power tariffs also impacted sentiment,” he said.
Overleveraged positions and high leverage costs played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the market, Mehanti added.
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a loss of 1,200.12 points, or 1.87%, and settled at 62,943.75.
Topline Securities, in its commentary, remarked that the market reacted negatively to delayed results of general elections where initial announcements showed no clear majority for a single party.
“The KSE-100 index declined to the intra-day low of 2,362 points (down 3.68%),” it said.

However, some recovery was observed as the day progressed and results started pouring in where the number of seats won by the PML-N increased and the probability of a coalition government emerged.
Major contribution to the index’s slump came from Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum, Engro Corporation, Engro Fertilisers and Hub Power as they shed value, pulling the market down by 366 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, noted that the end of a shortened, but very eventful week saw the KSE-100 remain flat week-on-week.
Only eight stocks rose on Friday while 77 fell with Oil and Gas Development Co (-3.71%), Pakistan Petroleum (-3.7%) and Engro Corporation (-2.37%) being the biggest drags on the index, it said.
“Election results, which kept dominating the news flow, will be the key driver for the market next week,” it predicted.
Despite -1.9% day-on-day close following delay in election results, “price action did not break the structure and remained within the converging trend lines”, AHL added.
JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal stated that the KSE-100 index experienced a decline of 1,200 points, concluding the day at 62,944.
Trading session began with a 2,000-point drop due to delay in the announcement of election results, he pointed out. A volume of 258 million shares was recorded where K-Electric (-4.3%), Oil and Gas Development Co (-3.7%), Pakistan Petroleum (-3.7%), Pakistan Refinery (-3.7%) and Worldcall Telecom (-4.5%) were the volume leaders, the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 258.1 million shares against Wednesday’s tally of 327.6 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs12.5 billion.
Shares of 319 companies were traded. Of these, 55 stocks closed higher, 241 dropped and 23 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 20.5 million shares, losing Rs0.21 to close at Rs4.65. It was followed by Oil and Gas Development Co with 18.9 million shares, losing Rs5.59 to close at Rs145.08 and Pakistan Petroleum with 17.9 million shares, losing Rs4.49 to close at Rs116.78.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs607.3 million, according to the NCCPL.

3,"Oil rises 1%, heads for weekly gain",Amid persistent tensions in Middle East after Israel rejected ceasefire offer,"Oil prices rose on Friday and were on track for gains of almost 7% week-on-week, amid persistent tensions in the Middle East after Israel rejected a ceasefire offer from Hamas.
Brent crude futures rose 79 cents, or 0.97%, on the day to $82.42 a barrel by 1446 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose $1.02, or 1.34%, to $77.24 a barrel.
Israeli forces continued deadly air strikes on Gaza on Friday, after the bombing of Gaza’s southern border city of Rafah on Thursday helped send oil prices up by around 3% in the previous session. “It takes two to tango to reach a ceasefire deal in the Middle East and tensions in the region have not gone away,” said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.
Oil futures are into their fifth straight day of gains, buoyed this week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s rejection of a Hamas ceasefire proposal on Wednesday.
“With the words that, ‘no part of the Gaza Strip would be immune from Israel’s offensive’, it was not hard for oil participants to conclude that without even a passing regard for peace, there was not enough conflict-premium priced in,” PVM analyst John Evans said.

Elsewhere, Ukraine launched drone attacks against two oil refineries in southern Russia on Friday, resulting in a fire at the Ilsky refinery. The Afipsky refinery, also in Krasnodar Krai which borders Crimea on the Black Sea and Azov Sea coast, was the other facility in the attack.
Russia is exporting more crude in February than it planned under an OPEC+ deal, following a combination of drone attacks and technical outages at its refineries. “Proof still needs to be provided that Russia is able to cut oil exports sufficiently even without weather-related constraints,” Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said on Friday in reference to the country’s OPEC+ cut quota.
Meanwhile, the US Treasury Department on Thursday sanctioned another three entities based in the United Arab Emirates and one tanker registered by Liberia for violating a cap placed on the price of Russian oil by a coalition of Western nations.

4,Job cuts expected at banks in Asia,"Japan, India offer hope amid market turmoil in China","Job cuts at Western investment banks in Asia are expected to increase this year as revenue pressures rise due to deepening economic and market turmoil in China, even as deal prospects brighten in Japan and India, headhunters and bankers said.
A new round of staff cuts that began in late 2023 on the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, key regional investment banking hubs, will gather pace in the coming months, they added.
US boutique bank Lazard announced internally last month it would close its Beijing office, resulting in some employees being laid off, while others were to be relocated to Hong Kong, two people with knowledge of the move said.
Its European peer Rothschild disbanded its Shanghai-based team in the fourth quarter, two separate people with knowledge of the matter said. Bank of America last month announced job cuts of more than 20 bankers in Asia. Sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media. Lazard and Rothschild declined to comment.
China’s stock markets hovering around five-year lows and the country’s weaker-than-expected recovery from the pandemic have deepened investor worries and soured companies’ domestic demand outlook. Geopolitical tensions have also driven foreign investors away.
“If the deal flow continues the way it has been in 2023, the market could expect some more cuts,” said Sid Sibal, vice president Greater China and head of Hong Kong, at recruitment firm Hudson.
China deals
Financial institutions on average have cut roughly 20% of their workforce in Asia last year, with some reductions hitting the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, Sibal said.
More than 400 investment bankers lost their jobs in Hong Kong alone, most of them focused on China deals, said two investment banking headhunters, who declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
“I don’t think western investors will come back to look at China deals soon,” said a regional investment banking head at a large European bank who also declined to be named for the same reason.

Global investment banks’ income from equities business generated from Chinese clients slumped to $4 billion in 2023, 30% lower than 2022, and M&A posted a 16% fall to $629 million last year, according to data from LSEG. Overall, investment banking fees collected by global banks in the Asia Pacific dropped 25% in 2023 from a recent peak of $40.6 billion in 2021, LSEG data showed.
UBS is planning headcount cuts in the coming months as the Swiss investment bank’s China-focused bankers swelled after it took over Credit Suisse, two sources with knowledge of its plans said.
UBS declined to comment.
‘Episodic activity’
To cushion the impact of China’s slowdown, bankers are hoping a promising deals pipeline from India to Japan will make bigger contributions to Asian revenue. They cautioned, however, that fee income growth would remain challenging in the near term.
“Most other Asian markets are too small or episodic in activity,” said Craig Coben, a former Bank of America senior banker in Asia and now a managing director at financial expert witness firm Seda Experts.
“Japan has depth as a developed market, but in most years Greater China revenues have dwarfed Japan by several times. India is growing fast, but fee spreads are tight and it’s not close to replacing China.”
Rahul Saraf, head of India investment banking at Citigroup, estimates India revenue will grow between 15% and 25% for the industry, with a number of prospective multibillion-dollar transactions boosting the outlook.
“All banks will add resources to India but I don’t think there is a shift from China to India or Korea to India.”

5,IMF urges BOJ to consider ending yield curve control,Advises gradual rise of short-term rates as economy recovers,"The Bank of Japan (BOJ) should consider ending its yield curve control and massive asset purchases now, then gradually raise short-term interest rates, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday, as markets ramp up bets on a near-term turn in the central bank’s ultra-easy policy.
As Japan’s economy continues to recover, domestic demand is replacing rising costs as the main driver of inflation with the output gap closing and labour shortages intensifying, the IMF said.
“The BOJ has been appropriately cautious, given Japan’s history of deflation and mixed signals from recent data. That said, upside risks to inflation have materialised in the past year,” the global lender said.
“In the near term, the focus should shift to tighten fiscal policy and wind down unconventional monetary policy, while maintaining financial stability,” the IMF said in a statement after its annual policy consultation with Japan.
With inflation having exceeded 2% for well over a year, the BOJ has been laying the groundwork for ending a complex stimulus programme comprising a massive asset-buying programme dubbed quantitative and qualitative easing (QQE), a negative short-term interest rate and yield curve control (YCC) – a policy that caps long-term interest rates around zero.

Read IMF tepid to interim govt proposals
Many market players expect the BOJ to end negative rates this year with the most popular timing seen as April, according to a Reuters poll. “The BOJ should consider exiting YCC and ending QQE now while gradually raising short-term policy rates thereafter,” the IMF said.
Gradual exit
Ending its negative interest rate policy, in place since 2016, will likely be smooth as there is a clear recognition by investors that inflation-adjusted real borrowing costs will remain very low, IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath told Reuters on Friday.
But further hikes in the short-term policy rate ought to be gradual and delivered in the course of several years, she said. “Regardless of whether you do the first increase in two months or three months, the main point is to raise (rates) slowly, over a few years,” Gopinath said.
In a briefing in Tokyo later on Friday, Gopinath said March data on wage developments would be among important indicators that determine the timing of an end to negative rates.

6,Exports to Afghanistan rise 3.63% in 6 months,Recorded at $260.716m during Jul-Dec 2023-24,"Pakistan’s export of goods and services to Afghanistan witnessed an increase of 3.63% during the first six months of the current fiscal year (2023-24) as compared to the exports of the corresponding period of last year, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported.
The overall exports to Afghanistan were recorded at $260.716 million during July-December (2023-24) against exports of $251.580 million during July-December (2022-23), the SBP data revealed.

On a year-to-year basis, however, the exports to Afghanistan decreased by 26.83% from $38.297 million in December 2022, against the exports of $28.019 million in December 2023.
Meanwhile, on a month-on-month basis, the exports to Afghanistan also witnessed a decline of 46.02% during December 2023 as compared to the exports of $51.911 million in November 2023. Pakistan’s overall exports to other countries jumped by 4.99% in the first six months, from $14.222 billion to $15.288 billion.

7,Bitcoin surges in biggest weekly rally in four months,Rises 5% to one-month high on increased buying ahead of April’s halving,"Bitcoin rose 5% on Friday to one-month highs, powered by what analysts said was a flurry of buying ahead of April’s halving event and as recent outflows from exchange-traded funds slowed.
The price rose to a session peak of $47,705, the most since January, after the first US listed spot bitcoin exchange traded products received regulatory approval. The world’s largest cryptocurrency was last up 3.5% at $46,946, set for a rise of 10% this week, its most in a week since October. Ether was up 2.5% at $2,486.
Bitcoin hit a two-year high just above $49,000 in January, but has since trended lower, under pressure from a “sell the news” wave of profit-taking after the Securities and Exchange Commission finally approved the ETFs.

Read Bitcoin falls to $40,000, lowest level since bitcoin ETF launch
The drop in bitcoin went against the grain of other financial markets in recent weeks, as stocks, bonds and gold all rallied on the back of an expectation for global central banks to switch to cutting interest rates this spring.
Policymakers have since pushed back against this and economic data has not supported the view that rates should fall any time soon, but risk assets like stocks have risen, with bitcoin resuming its march higher. Friday’s jump in price was said to be a function of a slowing in recent ETF outflows and a burst of buying ahead of April’s halving, analysts said. “With bitcoin back up to $46,000 this morning, traders are clearly gearing up for the hotly anticipated halving event due in roughly two months,” Scope Markets’ chief markets analyst Joshua Mahony said.
The next halving is expected in April, a process designed to slow the release of bitcoin, whose supply is capped at 21 million – of which 19 million have already been mined – by cutting the reward for producing the tokens in half.

8,Forex reserves dip $173m to $8.04b,SBP attributes decrease to debt repayment; rupee appreciates slightly,"The central bank on Friday reported that Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves reached $8.04 billion with a 2.1% week-on-week decline.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), in a statement, explained that the reduction in reserves came as a result of debt repayments by the country.
According to data released by the SBP, its foreign currency reserves registered a drop of $173 million and reached $8,044 million in the week ended on February 2, 2024 compared to the previous week’s total of $8,216.5 million.
With the addition of commercial banks’ foreign currency reserves, Pakistan’s total liquid reserves stood at $13,097.6 million. Of these, the commercial banks held net reserves of $5,053.6 million.

Read Forex reserves dip $54m to $8.21b
A couple of weeks ago, Caretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar announced that the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves would reach $9.1 billion following the receipt of International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) loan tranche of $700 million in mid-January.
Such high reserves had last been seen in July 2022, indicating they spiked to an 18-month high. The IMF had wanted Pakistan to achieve that level by June 2024, but the country did it five months ahead.
Pakistani rupee on Friday edged up 0.02%, or Rs0.06, to Rs279.28 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market compared to Wednesday’s close at Rs279.34. The rupee maintained its winning streak for the third consecutive working day apparently in the wake of higher inflows of foreign currency.

9,Changes to Electricity Act sought,Govt wants modernisation of law in line with new realities in power sector,"The caretaker government has directed the Power Division to amend the National Electricity Act 1910 to keep pace with new realities in the power sector as progress has so far been slow on introducing a competitive electricity market with the help of wheeling charges.
Successive governments have strived to implement the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contracts Market (CTBCM) that allows private consumers to take electricity supplies directly from power producers.
At present, all consumers are bound to receive electricity from the national grid, which has long been plagued with rampant theft and losses.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), the power sector regulator, has taken an initiative to open the market and introduce the CTBCM model. However, there has not been sufficient progress on the plan.
During discussions in a recent meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCOE), it was observed that the CCOE had constituted a committee to deliberate on wheeling charges and swiftly present its recommendations.
At the same time, the Power Division was directed to conduct an internal assessment through taking up the matter with the industry and relevant stakeholders. It was asked to submit its assessment to the committee by mid-February 2024.
Wheeling charges comprise the fee that will be paid to transmission and distribution companies for supplying electricity from power plants to customers via a third party.
It was emphasised that the National Electricity Act 1910 needed to be updated and modernised in line with new realities in the power sector.
The cabinet body on energy directed the Power Division to apprise it of the status of the electricity trading market plan.
The committee was informed that the Power Division had been working on market reforms with the aim of transitioning to the competitive market model, named CTBCM, from the existing single buyer model.
In this regard, the Power Division had presented the CTBCM model and roadmap to the CCOE in a meeting dated March 27, 2020.
The CCOE demonstrated keen interest in the adoption of electricity market reforms, calling it one of the most critical and important activities, and decided to directly monitor the execution of the CTBCM plan.
It told the Power Division to submit monthly reports on the progress achieved in efforts to implement the CTBCM plan.

Read NEPRA mulls record Rs5.62/unit hike in electricity prices
In compliance with the directive, the Power Division prepared monthly reports on the progress on CTBCM for the months of October, November and December 2023.
First part of progress reports highlights key updates on CTBCM including the cabinet committee’s approval for the submission of final test-run report to Nepra and its ratification by the federal cabinet.
The second part focuses on readiness of the power sector for the competitive wholesale electricity market whereas the last part presents updates on the completion of actions planned under the CTBCM test-run phase.
The Power Division submitted the reports to the CCOE. The committee considered the summary submitted by the Power Division titled “Submission of monthly reports to CCOE on the progress towards implementation of Competitive Trading Bilateral Contracts Market (CTBCM)”.
The CCOE told the Power Division to update the committee already constituted by the CCOE, headed by the minister for finance, revenue and economic affairs, on the issue of wheeling charges after discussing the matter with the relevant stakeholders, and submit updates.
Recently, the government also decided to extend the scope of negotiations with independent power plants (IPPs) to cover hydel and gas-based projects as well in an effort to slash tariffs, which have continued to surge in recent months.
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, during its tenure, had started negotiations with the IPPs to review the dollar indexation clause. A cap was placed to control electricity prices that were rising with continuous depreciation of the rupee.
The current caretaker government has continued negotiations with wind energy producers. Now, it has decided to talk to hydel and gas-based IPPs as well.
It directed the Power Division in a recent meeting of the CCOE to come up with a separate summary.
The cabinet body told the Power Division to initiate a separate case for engaging with the remaining IPPs, including those dealing with hydel power that did not sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU).
During discussions, according to sources, CCOE members noted that the scope of negotiations should not be restricted to wind or bagasse-based power plants but hydel and gas-fired IPPs may also be included.
