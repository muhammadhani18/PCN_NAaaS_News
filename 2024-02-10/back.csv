0,Achakzai offers PkMAP platform to PTI to form govt,Announces Balochistan-wide protests against rigging,"Pashtunkhawa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai on Friday invited the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed independent winners to join his party and form the next federal government by electing party chairman Gohar Khan as prime minister.
Achakzai said in a statement that his party had been kept out of parliament because “they don't like our faces.” He added that he knew that the election results would not be announced in his favour, therefore, he did not bother to stay up the whole night.
PTI-backed independent candidates sprang a big surprise by taking the nearly 100 National Assembly seats in Thursday’s elections. The candidates contested the elections as independents because the party was denied its electoral symbol because of its intra-party election controversy.

“Barrister Gohar and other independent candidates should join the PkMAP and become the prime minister,” said Achakzai, who himself was elected from Chaman-Killa Abdullah seat. We are out of parliament,” he added.
Alleging that election results had been tampered with, Achakzai stated that he had already understood that the results were not in his party’s favour, therefore, he did not bothered to stay up the previous night and wait for the election outcome.
“During the day we were winning on the national and provincial seats but in the night we lost, maybe they don't like our faces,” he said. “Some officers have taken millions of rupees from the candidates,” the PkMAP chief alleged. He announced protest against election rigging on Saturday (today).

1,"Govt asserts neutrality, dismissing allegations","Defending election-day actions, minister says results validate stance","Denying allegations of state-sponsored rigging, caretaker Interior Minister Gohar Ijaz on Friday asserted the government had maintained neutrality throughout the election process, adding the election results attested to the fact.
""Had the government acted with mala fide intent, the results would not have been as they are,"" Ijaz, who was flanked by Information Minister Murtaza Solangi, said during a press conference.
Ijaz expressed confidence in the decisions made for the betterment of the public. ""We knew there would be criticism over the internet and mobile phone shutdown,"" acknowledged Ijaz, underlining the importance of prioritising human lives.
The interior minister, while discussing security challenges faced by the interim government during the general elections, stated on Friday that 56 incidents were reported on election day despite the suspension of mobile services. ""The decision to shut down mobile services was made at a high-level security meeting.""
He revealed that the ""emergency decisions"" were made due to the ""martyrdom of 28 individuals"" a day earlier to the elections. The mobile services were suspended because the terror attack was ""not a suicide attack, but a device bomb attached to a motorcycle"".
The minister highlighted the necessity of such measures for the protection of human lives, stating: ""These actions were crucial for ensuring the safety of individuals."" Furthermore, he reported that ""there were 56 incidents on the day of the election, and there were intelligence reports of terrorist incidents taking place.""
Eijaz said that ""February 8 was a challenging day"" as he referenced the terrorist incidents of February 7 in which 26 people were martyred. In light of the Qilla Saifullah incident, he said, ""We decided to close mobile signals"" in a high-level meeting.
He acknowledged the difficulty of the decision, saying, ""It was not an easy decision to close mobile signals"", justifying it as one taken to ""secure lives"".
Expressing pride in the security forces, he posed the question, ""Shouldn't we be proud of our security forces?""
The minister stated, "" 56 incidents occurred despite mobile signals being off, in which the Pakistan Army and police personnel were martyred."" Additionally, he said, ""As the sitting government we have to protect lives.""
The caretaker minister paid tribute to the fallen security personnel, stating, ""We salute the Pakistani forces' personnel who gave their lives yesterday."" He concluded that ""All institutions collaborated to conduct a peaceful election. We have many enemies who attacked us. The election result is in front of you. It is the voice of the nation.""
""As per our commitment, the caretaker government conducted elections, and the process of receiving results is ongoing,"" stated Information Minister Murtaza Solangi.
Solangi said, ""We the voters of Pakistan should choose the future ruler."" He also underscored the overall ""peaceful"" nature of the election and the caretaker government's commitment to ensuring a tranquil electoral process.
Cellular services suspension
Pakistan witnessed a countrywide shutdown of internet and cellular phone services a day earlier during the polling process with the authorities attributing the move ""to maintain law and order"" in the wake of the violence that occurred a day earlier.
However, the suspension was denounced by Amnesty International, which described it as a “reckless attack on people’s rights”, as well as experts and political stakeholders, particularly the PTI, a political party that relied heavily on social media platforms for its electoral campaign.
""It has been decided to temporarily suspend mobile services across the country,"" an interior ministry spokesman said in a statement.
The spokesman added that “precious lives have been lost” in recent militant attacks in the country and ""security measures are essential to maintain law and order situation and to deal with potential threats"".

2,NDM chief Mohsin Dawar injured by cops firing,Police claim they retaliated when ex-MNA’s activists attacked security forces camp in N Waziristan,"National Democratic Movement (NDM) chief Mohsin Dawar and at least 14 of his party activists were injured on Saturday in the Miran Shah area of North Waziristan when police opened fire on them while they were protesting against the delay in election results in NA-40 from where the former MNA was contesting.
In their defence, the police claimed that the NDM supporters opened fire at a security camp in the area and the former lawmaker was injured in the leg after they retaliated.
According to reports received from eyewitnesses, following a two-day delay in the results, the NDM chief and his activists were protesting against the refusal of permission to enter the returning officer's office located in Miran Shah’s Cantonment area when the firing started.
There have been conflicting reports about the firing. Official sources claimed that the initiative was taken by the protesters, when they attacked a security camp in the area.
However, the protesters maintained that the police personnel stationed near the stadium gate opened fire on them, in which three of them were killed -- Ayub Wazir, Wahab Khan Dawar, and Wahabullah.
The injured protesters were first shifted to Miran Shah Hospital and then Bannu. The NDM chief was shifted to Peshawar, where sources said his condition was out of danger.

After the incident, the situation in the entire area became tense, while JUI-F candidate Mufti Misbahuddin's victory from NA-40 was also announced.
NDM supporters have blocked roads in various areas against the incident, affecting the flow of vehicular traffic.
Before the incident, Dawar had shared a post on social media platform X that he was leading the polls as per the latest results received in his constituency NA-40 but there were “blatant attempts” to rig the final results. He claimed that 27 presiding officers were being held hostage at Shewa Qila and FC personnel were forcing them to sign a blank Form-45.
Taking to X after the firing, NDM leader Bushra Gohar held the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) responsible for the attack.
Afrasiab Khattak, another NDM leader, maintained that the law-enforcement agencies opened fire on Dawar and the other protesters.
BNP-M chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal also condemned the attack on Dawar in post on X, maintaining that it was carried out to change the results.
PPP leader Farhatullah Babar in post on X demanded a probe into the attack on the NDM chief.
He further called for punishing the “trigger happy” police personnel, who had fired the gunshots at the protesters.
The K-P Bar Council also condemned the murderous attack on Dawar, saying that unrest was increasing in the country, raising a question mark on the performance of security agencies.
Separately, one person was killed and two injured in a bomb blast near the residence of newly elected PTI-backed independent MNA Zubair Wazir, who won from NA-42, in the Karikot area of Wana tehsil, Lower South Waziristan district.
The person, who died in the attack, has been identified as Hayatullah. The injured include Shah Jahan and Rashid Khan.

4,"Four dead, dozens injured in PTI-police clash",Shangla election dispute escalates into chaos; ex-PTI candidate among injured,"In the first serious post-election violence since Thursday's vote, a clash over rigging allegations between Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) workers and the police in Shangla on Friday left four people dead and over 30 injured, four of whom were transferred to hospital in critical condition.

Among the wounded was Nawaz Mehmood, a former National Assembly candidate of PTI, as well as seven police officers. Moreover, over three dozen PTI workers were taken into police custody.

The unrest unfolded in the aftermath of Thursday's elections when the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) declared Ameer Muqam, a senior leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), as the victor.

According to unofficial results, Ameer Muqam emerged triumphant in the National Assembly constituency NA-11, clinching victory with a total of 59,863 votes, while Fareen trailed Muqam, amassing 54,311 votes.

Infuriated by what they alleged to be rigging, the PTI-backed candidate’s supporters took to the streets demanding a recount and the submission of Form 45.

The situation escalated as violent protests erupted, causing gridlock on the Alpuri-Basham main highway from 6 am onwards. The PTI-backed independent candidate and other party leaders formally announced a sit-in, addressing the crowd.
At around 4 o'clock, the protesters headed towards the District Returning Officer but faced resistance from the police, leading to a violent clash with stone pelting, tear gas and shelling.

The Alpuri Main Chowk transformed into a battlefield, with the Assistant Returning Officer's car set ablaze by the protestors.
There were also protests against allegedly rigged results in Peshawar and Quetta.

The PTI released a video of the incident, asserting that four of its members succumbed to gunshot wounds inflicted by the police.

""Our results have been changed,"" claimed 28-year-old shopkeeper Muhammad Saleem, who joined around 2,000 PTI supporters marching in Peshawar.

""The government should recount all of our votes.""

In response to the heightened tensions, the police took control of Alpuri, implementing strict checks at entry and exit points to maintain order and security.

5,"Imran, his ex-ministers get bail in May 9 cases","ATC observes that PTI leaders, Sheikh Rashid were booked in cases months after the rioting incidents","A trial court has granted bail to former prime minister Imran Khan and his two former cabinet members—Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Sheikh Rashid—in a series of cases registered against them following the May 9, 2023, rioting incidents.
Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Judge Malik Ejaz Asif granted this relief to the politicians during the hearing of their bail applications at the judicial complex of the garrison city on Saturday.
Violent protests erupted nationwide on May 9, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan's arrest from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) premises in connection with a corruption case.
Protesters, allegedly PTI supporters and workers, attacked various state and military installations, including the GHQ in Rawalpindi. They also vandalized and set fire to memorials and other properties.
In July of the same year, a high-level joint investigation team (JIT) decided to nominate the former premier in two terrorism cases, including one related to the attack on the GHQ. Additional sections were added to the cases, charging the PTI leader with plotting and incitement to violence.
In total, Imran was implicated in 12 different cases related to the May 9 rioting. Shah Mahmood Qureshi faced accusations in 13 such cases, while Sheikh Rashid was named in one rioting case. These politicians later filed separate bail applications in these cases.
Read Imran arrested in GHQ attack case
During Saturday's hearing, Judge Asif expressed extreme displeasure at the absence of public prosecutors. He adjourned the court for an hour, directing the prosecutors to appear immediately for arguments.
When the court resumed, the prosecutors were still absent. The judge then ordered the investigation officers (IOs) to present case details and respond to court questions. However, the IOs failed to provide satisfactory answers.
Subsequently, the judge granted bail to Imran in all 12 cases upon submission of a surety bond worth Rs100,000 for each case. Qureshi was granted bail in all 13 cases upon submission of a bond worth Rs100,000 for each case, while Rashid was granted bail upon submission of a bond worth Rs200,000.
In its written order, the court noted that the accused were not initially named in the original First Information Reports (FIRs). Their names were added to the reports four to five months after the rioting incidents. The court stated that there was evidently no evidence against the accused.
The court also observed that while many accused in such cases were out on bail, there was no justification for detaining the accused politicians.
Imran Khan was recently convicted in three different cases, while Qureshi was sentenced to 10 years in prison in the cipher case. The bail relief, however, will not result in their immediate release from prison. Nevertheless, Sheikh Rashid was released from jail following the court's order.

7,CM Punjab crown up for grabs,Maryam and Shehbaz likely candidates; chances of an outsider snagging the coveted slot seem minuscule,"As the dust settles on the dramatic battleground of Punjab, PML-N now finds itself with a slight edge, setting the stage for the selection of a chief minister, with a hint of PPP's table talk seasoning the political plot.

The party is ready to roll the dice and engage in table talk with the PPP to secure strategic positions.

However, the writing on the wall seems clear: the chief minister of the political capital will undoubtedly hail from the Sharif family, leaving party leaders with a slim chance of snatching the coveted seat.

The main contenders, Shehbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz, take centre stage.However, a final decision will be taken in light of a consensus, especially if brokered with PPPP on key positions.
Delving into the number game for the Punjab Assembly, where 297 general seats are up for grabs, the magic number to form the government is approximately 149 seats.
In the first phase, any political party requires approximately 149 general seats. Following this, the political party secures reserved seats, and after adding up the reserved seats, the total number for that political party reaches around 186.

The PML-N, in its opening gambit, may align with the PPP which grabbed 10 seats in Punjab. To bolster its hand further, PML-N may also court the 128-strong contingent of independent candidates backed by PTI.

The PML-N will easily cross the first phase of the number game. But in the next phase, who will be installed in the CM’s slot depends on the decisions made during the table talk with PPPP regarding the adjustment of key posts.

Should the three-time premier, Nawaz Sharif, eyes the prime minister’s chair, the younger Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif, emerges as a formidable CM candidate. However, if PML-N nominates Shehbaz Sharif for PM, Maryam Nawaz takes the spotlight as a strong contender.
Under the current circumstances, the chances of an outsider snagging this slot seem minuscule. However, in the unpredictable realm of politics, strategies evolve, and the need of the hour often reshapes decisions, making the nomination of a close and trustworthy party member imperative.

8,Pakistan draws UN attention to mosque demolition in India,Envoy says human security cannot be guaranteed if right to self-determination is denied,"The Pakistani mission at the UN has also drawn attention of the world body to last week's ""brazen"" demolition of the centuries-old Akhonji mosque in New Delhi, and called for the UN intervention to protect Islamic sites in India.

Pakistan has also warned that human security is not possible without allowing the people to exercise their fundamental right to self-determination, like those struggling for freedom in Palestine and Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).

Pakistan’s Representative to the UN, Ambassador Munir Akram, in a letter to the UN Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), said that the demolition of the Akhonji mosque “marks another highly disturbing chapter in an alarming campaign targeting Islamic sites and heritage in India”.

Akram said in the letter to UNAOC top official Miguel Angel Moratinos that the demolition of the mosque symbolises a concerning rise in Hindu-majoritarianism, adding that the state's support for normalising such incidents poses imminent threats to the well-being of the Indian Muslims.

The Akhonji mosque, standing for over 800 years, was abruptly demolished by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) officials in the middle of the night under a significant police presence, catching the local community, mosque-goers, and Madressah students entirely off guard without any prior warning.

“The pervasive influence of the 'Hindutva' ideology, alongside alarming incidents of Islamophobia and the demolition of historic mosques, calls for immediate and unwavering international attention,” the Pakistan envoy said.

Separately, Pakistani representative Senator Mohsin Aziz told the Annual Parliamentary Hearing at the UN that human security cannot be guaranteed when people around the world are denied their fundamental right to self-determination.

Annual Parliamentary Hearing is a joint initiative of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU). The event, hosted by UNGA President Dennis Francis and IPU President Tulia Ackson, which is attended by some 300 participants from more than 70 countries.

""Human Security cannot be guaranteed when people over the world are denied their fundamental right to self-determination,"" Aziz said. The Kashmir tragedy, he added, has intensified after the unilateral measures taken by India on the 5th of August 2019.

""Simultaneously, a concerted effort is under way [by India] to change the demographic structure and composition of the occupied territory [of Kashmir], a direct violation of the resolutions of the Security Council,"" he added.

Aziz reaffirmed Pakistan's full support and solidarity with the Palestinian people in these tragic times. “How much more blood, starvation, brutality and misery the world has to witness before we can come to a ceasefire and a reduction in the suffering of Palestinians in general,"" he asked.

Senator Mohsin Aziz told the Annual Parliamentary Hearing that the past four months have illustrated the consequences of the suppression of the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people as over 27,000 civilians have been killed by Israel in Gaza.

9,PPP clean sweeps Sindh,"Bags 37 out of 39 National Assembly seats across Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Nawabshah, Sukkur, Larkana divisions","The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) clinched an unprecedented and absolute victory in five out of six administrative divisions in the interior Sindh, bagging 37 out of 39 National Assembly seats and 74 out of 83 Sindh Assembly seats.
The PPP routed the opponents in 22 districts, taking 11 National Assembly and 24 Sindh Assembly seats in Hyderabad division, eight National Assembly and 16 Sindh Assembly seats in Larkana; 7 National Assembly and 11 provincial assembly seats in Sukkur; 6 National Assembly and 12 provincial assembly seats in Nawabshah; and 5 National Assembly and 11 provincial Assembly seats in Mirpurkhas division.
The party lost only two National Assembly seats, which were in Hyderabad. The party however, won one remaining seat from there. In the five divisions, the party lost 9 provincial assembly seats, compared to 14 losses in 2018 elections.
Four of the candidates who could succeed against the PPP were the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed independents, three belonged to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and two to the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA).
The Mirpurkhas division, with 5 national and 11 provincial assembly seats turned up as the strongest electoral fortress for the party with no defeat. In the 25-seat Larkana division and 19-seat Nawabshah division, the PPP lost just one constituency each.
Out of 41 constituencies in Hyderabad division, the PPP's candidates were trounced only on six seats, all in Hyderabad district – one of the nine districts in the division. Three seats were also lost in Sukkur division which consists of 21 constituencies.
The PPP also won on five National Assembly constituencies in Jacobabad, Shikarpur, Ghotki, Mirpurkhas and Badin districts, which were won by the PTI, GDA and one independent in the 2018 elections.
The party caused upsets for the GDA in Sanghar and Khairpur districts, which had been considered as strongholds of Pir Pagara Syed Sibghatullah Rashdi, who heads the alliance. The GDA managed to secure one seat each from the two districts against its five provincial assembly seats in 2018.
The big shock surfaced in Badin, where Dr Zulfiqar Mirza and Dr Fehmida Mirza, whose sons and supported candidates could not defend their previous victories. Besides the Arbabs of Tharparkar, the Jatois of Naushehroferoze, the Abbassis of Larkana and the Syeds of Mirpurkhas were also vanquished.

The Jamaat-e-Ulema-Islam-Fazl also put up a strong fight in some constituencies in Jacobabad, Kashmore-Kandhkot, Shikarpur, Kambar-Shahdadkot and Sukkur. But, its candidates could not secure success.
However, despite such a massive inroad, the PPP did confront setbacks on at least in two provincial constituencies in Jacobabad and Ghotki districts. It lost its seat, PS-3 Jacobabad III, to PTI's independent candidate Mumtaz Hussain Khan and PS-19 Ghotki II to independent candidate Nadir Akmal Laghari.

MQM-P vs PTI
The battle between the two parties unfolded only in Hyderabad district. However, MQM ended up winning two National Assembly and three provincial assembly seats, giving only one provincial constituency to a PTI-backed independent candidate, according to RO's results.
The results of the MQM’s victory in NA-219, NA-220 and PS-64 were announced late on Friday night, around 30 hours after the end of the polling process.
