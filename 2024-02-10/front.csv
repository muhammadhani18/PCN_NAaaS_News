0,"Khan loyalists lead, but PML-N claims 'victory'",PML-N emerges single largest party; independents dominate political landscape amid poll rigging charges,"As the election dust settled on Friday with results on a majority of seats trickled in, a clear victor remained elusive and independents backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf maintained their numeric superiority over mainstream parties -- a scenario viewed as a long shot before the election.
However, the delayed result announcements—attributed by the government to the suspension of mobile phone services—kept the nation on edge for almost 24 hours.
The piecemeal announcements of the results threw the closely-watched contest into the throes of uncertainty, seeding speculations and eliciting alarms. The nation, nonetheless, remained deprived of closure.
On Friday evening, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif finally broke the silence by setting the tone for a national government in what his party dubbed as a victory speech after the PML-N emerged as the single largest party in Centre and Punjab following the February 8’s ‘tainted’ general elections.
Surprisingly, the three-time former prime minister’s speech came as the poll results were still pouring in and when questions were being raised at the inordinate delay by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the announcement of results, casting doubt on polls’ transparency.
Despite claims that ECP’s new system was capable of working even without the internet, it miserably failed when the time came. In fact, at 2:30am on Thursday night – over 8 hours after the polling process concluded – the result of not a single constituency could be announced and the chief election commissioner was forced to issue a warning to the presiding officers to announce results forthwith or face consequences.

The alleged manipulation of poll results also pushed the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom to raise concerns about the fairness of polls. While reacting to allegations of rigging in the general elections, the EU called for a full investigation while the US called into question the “undue restrictions” put in place during polls. The US, however, pledged to work with whoever formed the next government.
Despite the controversy, Nawaz’s victory speech has come at a time when PTI’s general secretary and chief organizer, Omar Ayub Khan, said that the PTI-backed independent candidates will form the federal and provincial governments as they have so far won the majority seats out of the 266 seats of the National Assembly.
Amid speculations that the poll results were miraculously changed in favour of PML-N despite PTI-backed independent candidates’ victory on majority seats, the elder Sharif while conceding that the people didn’t give a simple majority to PML-N said that his party respects the mandate that people have given to other political parties and independent candidates.
Meanwhile, PTI workers and supporters protested against the alleged rigged results in NA-11, claiming that the poll results were changed overnight. Reportedly, at least three PTI workers were killed in the clashes between the PTI workers and the law enforcers.
The PML-N won the most seats by a single party in Thursday's election, but supporters of imprisoned Khan, who ran as independents instead of as a single bloc after his party was barred from the polls, won the most seats overall.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) swept Sindh, clinching an impressive 84 general seats in the Sindh Assembly, according to unofficial and unconfirmed results.
Considering the inclusion of reserved seats for women and minorities, the PPP's dominance in the Sindh Assembly is poised to surpass 100 seats for the first time.
As for the PML-N’s position in Punjab, the party grabbed 133 seats in the provincial assembly with PTI-backed independents trailing with 128 seats.

2,COAS urges healing touch to move on from polarization,Gen Asim says Pakistan's diverse policy will be well-represented by unified govt,"Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir on Saturday said Pakistan’s diverse polity and pluralism will be ""well-represented by a unified government of all democratic forces"" imbibed with national purpose.

“Pakistan’s diverse polity and pluralism will be well-represented by a unified government of all democratic forces imbibed with national purpose. Elections and democracy are means to serve people of Pakistan and not ends in themselves,” the army chief said, as per the military's media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).

The COAS stressed that the nation needed stable hands and a healing touch to move on from the politics of anarchy and polarisation which does not suit a progressive country of 250 million people.

“Elections are not a zero-sum competition of winning and losing but an exercise to determine the mandate of the people. Political leadership and their workers should rise above self-interests and synergise efforts in governing and serving the people which is perhaps the only way to make democracy functional and purposeful.”

He noted that as the people of Pakistan have reposed their combined trust in the Constitution of Pakistan, it is now incumbent upon all political parties to reciprocate the same with political maturity and unity.

“As we move forward from this national milestone we must reflect on where the country stands today and where our rightful place should be in the comity of nations. COAS wishes that these elections bring in political and economic stability and prove to be the harbinger of peace and prosperity for our beloved Pakistan,” the statement read.

The COAS also congratulated the entire Pakistani nation, caretaker government, Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), political parties and all winning candidates on the successful conduct of the general elections 2024.

“Free and unhindered participation by Pakistani people to exercise their right of vote demonstrated their commitment to democracy and the rule of law as enshrined in constitution of Pakistan,” he added.

The COAS said that the “leadership and personnel of law-enforcement agencies deserve our highest appreciation for creating a safe and secure environment for the electoral process, despite overwhelming odds”.

The constructive role played by national media, civil society, members of civil administration and the judiciary enabled the successful conduct of the largest electoral exercise in national history, he added.

3,"PTI secures two-thirds majority in NA, claims Imran",Ex-premier congratulates supporters for 'winning' this year’s polls,"PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan on Friday claimed that his party had secured a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.
“You have laid foundation to real democracy in Pakistan by voting for us. I congratulate all of you for winning the elections 2024,” Imran said in his AI-generated speech.
“I had complete faith that all of you would come out to vote. The massive turnout has surprised everyone. [The] London plan has failed because of your votes. [PML-N supremo] Nawaz Sharif has given [his] victory speech despite being behind in at least 30 constituencies [in NA],” he added.
Imran further maintained that nobody in Pakistan would accept Nawaz’s speech and even the international media was writing against it.
“As per independent sources, we were winning in 150 constituencies before the rigging began. As per Form-45, we have won over 170 seats [out of the total 265],” the former premier claimed.
Imran said the people of Pakistan had created history.
“I thank the Almighty that he has made us into a nation. No one can stop us now from flying high. Celebrate this moment and offer prayers,” he added.
“Despite the continuous atrocities for the past two years, we have successfully won the 2024 elections with a two-thirds majority.”
The PTI founding chairman said everybody had now seen the power of votes, urging all to protect it.

In a related development, PTI stalwart Barrister Gohar Ali Khan ruled out forming an alliance with the PPP or PML-N, claiming his party had the required number of seats to form the federal government.
Speaking to a private TV news channel, Gohar maintained that the PTI was not in touch with either the PPP or PML-N.
“We are not intending to form a coalition government with the PPP or PML-N,” he continued.
The PTI stalwart added that apart from the Centre, the PTI would form provincial governments in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab as well.
According to the results released by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the PTI-nominated independent candidates have secured 76 seats in the K-P Assembly against 73 needed to form the government, meaning it has acquired a simple majority and does not need to forge an alliance with any other party to come into power there.
However, the race for the Punjab Assembly seats shows a neck-to-neck competition between the PTI-affiliated independent candidates and those belonging to the PML-N.

The PTI leader maintained that the party’s independent candidates would remain faithful to it and there was were no chances of them switching their loyalties.
Earlier, PML-N leader and former finance minister Ishaq Dar claimed that successful independent candidates were in touch with his party.
Separately in a video statement, Gohar claimed that efforts were under way to manipulate election results but the PTI-backed independent candidates had form 45 and they would move the relevant forums against irregularities in the polls.
He requested the ECP to announce the results of all candidates.
He continued that the process of forming the governments could kick off only after the announcement of all the results.

4,Nawaz put on a brave face,Ex-PM’s vision for coalition govt clashes with the stark reality portrayed by ECP’s dashboard,"In the aftermath of the electoral storm that swept through Thursday's general elections, leaving behind allegations of pre-poll trickery and delayed results, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif put on a brave face by claiming a victory even though the final results were still awaited on Friday, that shows a lack of democratic spirit.
The former premier extended an olive branch, pledging to accept the mandate bestowed upon all parties and independent candidates, ushering in a spirit of cooperation as uncertainty reigned the political landscape.
In a strategic move, Nawaz unveiled plans to build a coalition, nominating key figures of his party former prime minister Shehbaz Sharif and Ishaq Dar to engage the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and other smaller groups, mainly the component parties that were allies in the previous 16-month term of PDM to form a coalition government with his party at the forefront.
However, his optimistic vision clashes with the stark reality portrayed by the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) dashboard, which paints a different picture of electoral outcomes.
Independent candidates, an overwhelming majority of them backed by PTI, dominate the tally, and questions arise regarding PML-N's ability to secure a majority to form a government.
Even three hours after Nawaz Sharif’s “victory” speech (at 11pm), independents were leading the table with 96 seats followed by PML-N’s 66 and PPP’s 51 followed by other smaller parties while results on 29 National Assembly constituencies were still waiting.
Sharif's apparent omission from the prime ministerial candidacy further underscores the intricate web of legal, constitutional, and political complexities awaiting resolution in the post-election phase.
One thing became abundantly clear amid the uncertainty surrounding PML-N: the prospect of forming a government independently was simply out of reach, given their lack of a single majority. It was evident that they would need to forge alliances with other parties to cobble together a governing coalition, if at all possible.
Furthermore, Nawaz Sharif's speech hinted at a significant shift in ambitions within PML-N. The notion of him vying for the coveted position of Prime Minister for a fourth term, a cornerstone of the party's election campaign and prominently featured in full-page advertisements, now appears to be a thing of the past.
The unexpected outcome of the elections has sent shockwaves across the political spectrum, prompting serious legal, constitutional, and political deliberations among all stakeholders, including political parties, the judiciary, and the powers that be.
These deliberations are expected to unfold over the next two weeks, paving the way for the transition of power to the government elected as a result of the February 8, 2024 elections.

Of paramount importance in these deliberations is the handling of PTI's mandate. Once hailed as the favoured party of the powerful establishment, PTI fell out of favour nearly two years ago.
Despite the contentious nature of Thursday's election results, it's undeniable that PTI has emerged victorious against all odds, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), where it secured an unprecedented majority in both the National Assembly and provincial assembly seats.
This sweeping victory has effectively marginalised other parties that once held strongholds in the province. Additionally, PTI has solidified its position across Punjab, garnering significant support in terms of votes, if not necessarily seats.
The mandate of PTI cannot be disregarded, yet the decision by the ECP to strip PTI of its election symbol, later endorsed by the Supreme Court, poses unprecedented challenges for the party, not only during the election phase but also in the post-election period.
Once the final results are revealed, the allocation of reserved seats for women and minorities to political parties across all legislatures will commence.
However, the current constitutional and electoral laws do not address the allocation of reserved seats to legislators without party affiliations, as is the case in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa now where there is no way other than giving PTI-backed independents to form a government.
This dilemma is compounded by the largest group of independents returning to the National Assembly and Punjab Assembly as well since the non-party-based elections of 1985.
Various scenarios are being considered: the larger parties, PML-N and PPP, may seek to court independents to bolster their numbers before the allocation of reserved seats, potentially leading to unprecedented horse-trading. Alternatively, a major political party like PPP could absorb this independent chunk into a coalition government.
However, none of these scenarios promises stability.
Given the country's dire economic crisis and the need to adhere to IMF programs requiring further austerity measures, governance without public legitimacy will be exceedingly challenging, if not impossible.
The solution lies in a thorough reconsideration of stakeholder positions, grounded in an understanding of the ground realities and the people's mandate. This process is crucial not only among political leaders but also within the corridors of power.
In an already polarised atmosphere exacerbated by active militancy in two provinces, the provincialization of mainstream parties in the post-18th amendment era, whether planned or unplanned, risks further alienating the major political entities, which would be detrimental to the federation. The lessons from the 1970 elections are stark reminders that disregarding the mandate of any major political entity can have serious long-term ramifications.
