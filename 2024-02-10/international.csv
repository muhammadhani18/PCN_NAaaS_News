0,"PTI, MQM-P clash over rigging accusations","Five injured, two with gunshots; tensions high in Hyderabad","Amidst the inordinate delay in election results and growing apprehension of potential rigging, clashes erupted between activists of two political parties outside an election centre, resulting in a fierce confrontation. 
Workers engaged in physical altercations, exchanging blows and hurling stones. The situation escalated further with intense aerial firing by unidentified individuals, leaving five people injured, including two shot, purportedly belonging to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf and one from MQM Pakistan. 
Responding to the chaos, police and Rangers intervened, dispersing the agitated workers through baton charges and tear gas shelling. Two individuals were subsequently detained.
The incident unfolded at Public School Latifabad, designated as an election centre for the distribution of electoral materials and result compilation related to three national assembly seats and six provincial assembly seats in Hyderabad district. Initially tasked with returning election items, the center was later repurposed for recounting votes. 
Despite the timely cessation of polling, only two unofficial and unconfirmed results for the provincial assembly, PS 60 and PS 61, were disclosed late on Thursday night. This led to a continuous influx of officials and party workers throughout the night, causing unrest.
In the presence of a significant police and Rangers presence, candidates, and activists representing various political parties, including DRO and Deputy Commissioner Tariq Qureshi, District Election Commissioner Pervez Kalwar, and relevant ROs, anxiously awaited the delayed results. 
On Friday, as candidates and activists sought explanations for the prolonged delay, tensions rose, leading to bitter verbal exchanges and slogans between MQM and PTI supporters inside the school. Subsequently, PTI and MQM activists gathered outside the school, resulting in verbal clashes and minor physical altercations.
Senior members of both parties intervened multiple times, urging restraint among their workers. Police and Rangers also intervened, guiding them away from the election centre gate, attempting to quell the rising tensions and maintain order in the aftermath of the clash.

2,ECP failed to hold fair elections: JI,Delay in counting shows results were changed under planned conspiracy,"Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Karachi Ameer Engineer Hafiz Naeemur Rehman alleged that the Eletion Commission of Pakistan (ECP) did not perform its due role in holding free and fair elections. 
Speaking at the press conference, he said, the JI will hold protest and sit-ins against the rigging and insult to mandate of masses. He further said that the JI will expand the protest across the country.
The ECP will have to explain what outcome it wants to achieve by violating the mandate of masses time and again, he said. The entire exercise has cost Rs48 billion to the national exchequer. He said, what was the purpose of such an expensive exercise, if the ECP had to announce the results under a pre-planned mechanism. 
Detailing the anomalies, he said the ECP had announced that form 45 and 46 would be issued the same night but it was not done. 
He said that form 45 and 46 were issued on Friday which proves the worst kind of rigging and insult to the mandate of masses. He highlighted several examples, including one of PS-91 where Muttahida Qaumi Movment bagged 5,000 votes but in the connected NA, the MQM was bestowed 88,000 votes. 
He also highlighted that according to the announcement, JI's candidate in NA-236 only received 21,000 votes. Similarly, he said, Alamgir bagged only 10,000 votes as per the announcement, whereas both the candidates received much more votes as per form 45 and 46.

He further said that the JI's candidate Muhammad Farooq in PS-91 stood first with 23,000 votes whereas Muhammad Ahmed, Junaid Mukati, and Abdul Rasheed won in PS-124, 104 and 106 respectively.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Central Muslim League Karachi president, Ahmed Nadeem Awan, said that any change in the election results will not be acceptable. He said that counting of votes have not been completed even until the evening on the second day. It was the responsibility of the ECP to hold fair and transparent results of the general elections but the commission failed to do so. 
He alleged that results are being changed under a planned conspiracy. He said that the results in various constituencies are surprising. The candidates who were rejected by the people are being declares as winners. All the claims made by the ECP regarding the preparations for the elections turned out to be false. 
Awan said that voters turnout was shown less deliberately. He said that such actions on the part of the ECP and administrative machinery are regrettable and shameful. 
These actions will shatter public confidence in the electoral system. Pakistan cannot afford any more chaos. The mandate of the people should be respected and political parties should be given their right.
