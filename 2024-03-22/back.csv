1,Silence over call to roll back NFC intriguing: Farhatullah Babar,PPP leader says desire to reverse award tantamount to reversing 18th Constitutional Amendment,"Former Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) senator Farhatullah Babar voiced concerns on Friday regarding the ongoing debate surrounding the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, urging the finance ministry to address the issue promptly.
In a statement, the head of the party's human rights cell found the finance ministry's ""silence"" amidst media speculation about potential reductions in the provinces' share in the NFC Award ""intriguing"".
He called for a decisive response from the ministry to alleviate any apprehensions among the provinces, seeking “a firm rejoinder to dispel any misgivings in the provinces”.
The former senator said the desire to roll back NFC was tantamount to rolling back the 18th Constitutional Amendment, which he said has been ""the dream of undemocratic elements and centrists in the country for long"". He emphasized the importance of upholding provincial autonomy.
“Declare in categorical terms that the provincial autonomy guaranteed will not be compromised,” the PPP leader stressed.
Accusing certain factions of aiming to curtail provincial rights, Babar challenged the narrative blaming provinces for extravagant spending. He pointed out significant increases in the federal government's expenditures, particularly in areas such as pensions and executive expenses.
“Since 2011 pensions and superannuation allowances of the federal government have increased by nearly seven fold,” Babar maintained.
Read PPP reiterates position on NFC Award
The senator highlighted staggering increases in the federal government's spending, citing a notable rise of Rs563 billion in military pensions and Rs188 billion in civil pensions over the past 12 years.
He also noted an over eight-fold surge in expenses for the executive and legislative branches and current account expenditures.
Contrary to claims, Babar asserted that the NFC Award is not responsible for the government's financial challenges.
He stated that the root cause of the federal government's financial challenges lay in its failure to implement effective taxation policies, redundant ministries, and uncontrolled defense spending.
""The centrists should heed the UN report that privileges grabbed by the power elite exceed 17 billion dollars a year or six percent of the economy,"" Babar stated, urging them to prioritize reforms at the federal level instead of targeting provincial allocations.
The Express Tribune reported earlier this month that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged Pakistan to revisit the NFC Award to strike a balance between the provinces' and federal government's resources and responsibilities.
The PPP reiterated its position regarding the NFC Award formula, saying it is the constitutional right of the provinces, and should not be changed.
The party leadership has openly opposed the IMF's suggestion that Pakistan revisits the NFC formula to address the ongoing imbalance in the distribution of fiscal resources between federal and provincial governments.

2,Experts sceptical of Donald Lu's testimony in cypher case,"When claiming to be a sovereign country, we must defend that sovereignty: Naveed Hussain","Experts have raised serious questions on the testimony given by Donald Lu, the US Assistant Secretary of State for Central and South Asian Affairs, during the hearing of the cypher issue at the State Department.
Analysts termed Lu's statement as the 'truth of the United States', asserting that there is no doubt about America’s involvement in toppling governments in various countries.
Speaking on the talk show 'Experts' aired on Express News on Thursday, the Chief Editor of Express Tribune Naveed Hussain responded to the moderator Dua Jamil’s question and said: ""Donald Lu’s statement was celebrated in Pakistan—particularly by the government, but hasn't it been a trend of the US to topple governments around the world?""
Citing a report from The Washington Post, Hussain underscored that in 2016, the newspaper revealed that the US had tried to change governments in 72 countries during the Cold War, with some of these efforts being successful and others not.
The senior journalist referred to the statement made by former US President Donald Trump's National Security Advisor, John Bolton, in which Bolton admitted that America has been involved in regime change. Hussain questioned why is Pakistan surprised that the United States has not done it before.
The chief editor asserted that the 'cypher' was discussed during the National Security Committee moot. It was stated that the language used in the cypher was against diplomatic protocols, and a demarche was issued. However, the government later said that there was no cypher.
The senior journalist also asked critical questions, arguing that when there was no cypher, what did the government issue the demarche about? How did they sour relations with the US to the extent of protesting by summoning the US ambassador? How is the case of the cypher going against Imran Khan, the former prime minister?
Hussain emphasized, “When claiming to be a sovereign country, we must defend that sovereignty.” He stressed the need for investigation if such allegations arise – and pointed out that when Donald Lu labelled Imran Khan a liar, those present at the State Department countered by calling Lu a liar.
Group Editor of Daily Express Ayaz Khan characterized Lu's testimony as the ""Truth of the United States,"" noting that the entire world knows about ""America's history of building and overthrowing governments""
However, Khan highlighted the significance of the cypher case hearing at the State Department despite this well-known pattern.
The group editor anticipated that after the testimony of Lu, ""things will go further"". He asserted that the conversation that followed Lu’s statement should not be overlooked, as it touched upon topics such as our judiciary, election commission, human rights situation, and concerns about election integrity. He also pointed out that what happened earlier was not a one-time affair; its effects will remain and will have to be dealt with.
“Imran Khan also initially accused the US of conspiring against his government to destabilize but called upon the US to conduct a transparent investigation into the election,” he added.
Express News Bureau Chief in Islamabad Amir Ilyas Rana said he wasn’t surprised by the hearing on the cypher issue at the State Department. Citing hearings of 1991 and 2008, he emphasized that such post-election hearings have occurred in the past as well.
Conversely, the bureau chief criticized Imran and alleged that the current hearing was conducted and taken to such an extent because of a US lobbying firm hired by the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
Rana asserted that he critiqued the individuals who spoke in favour of Imran during the hearing at the State Department and maintained that these same people are supporting the bombing of Muslims in Gaza.
""The very people who lecture us on human rights are the ones who prevent us from speaking out against the carpet bombing against Muslims,"" Rana voiced his criticism.
Chairman Pakistan Ulema-e-Islam Council Allama Tahir Ashrafi expressed his disappointment over the reactions of PTI and the government following the hearing at the State Department. “I am ashamed as a Pakistani at the level to which we have stooped. One party expresses joy over American questioning of our elections, while the other is pleased with labelling the former prime minister as a liar. No good came for anyone, yet we find reasons to celebrate,” Ashrafi said.
Express News Bureau Chief in Lahore Muhammad Ilyas while condemning both Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) and PTI, has stated that following Wednesday's statement by Lu, both sides are celebrating without showing concern for Pakistan's interests.
Ilyas echoed concerns about interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs, stating that it is not good for Pakistan when outsiders meddle in our internal problems and affairs.

3,Power consumers brace for tariff surge,Six power distribution companies petition Nepra for rate increase,"Power consumers should brace themselves for another massive hike in electricity tariffs as six power utilities—DISCOs—have sought a revenue requirement of Rs967 billion on account of the indexation of tariff components and other costs for the year 2024-25.
Indexation of tariff components refers to the practice of adjusting or linking various components of a tariff—such as prices, fees, or charges—to an index or benchmark. This index could be based on factors like inflation rates, cost of living adjustments, or changes in market conditions.
The purpose of indexation is to ensure that tariffs remain aligned with prevailing economic conditions and to provide a mechanism for periodic adjustments to reflect changes in the underlying factors affecting costs or prices.
In separate multi-year tariff petitions submitted to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), these DISCOs have sought revenue requirements.
Nepra—the power regulator—has already determined tariffs for these DISCOs under the Multi-Year Tariff (MYT) regime for a period of five years—from FY 2020-21 to FY 2024-25.
The MYT regime is a regulatory framework used in the energy sector, particularly in electricity distribution, to set tariffs for a period spanning multiple years, typically ranging from three to five years.
Under the MYT regime, instead of setting tariffs annually, regulatory authorities establish tariffs for a defined period based on factors such as projected costs, investments, and revenue requirements.
Now, in line with the adjustment mechanism provided in its notified MYT determination, the Consumer End Tariff Methodology (Guidelines), 2015, and the amended Nepra Act, the DISCOs have filed requests for indexation of different components of their revenue requirement for FY 2024-25.
In its petition, Gepco has sought a total revenue requirement of Rs376.2 billion, which includes Rs15.5 billion for salaries, Rs13.1 billion for post-retirement benefits, Rs47.8 billion gross margins, Rs43 billion as net margins, and Rs19 billion as a prior-year adjustment.
Mepco has sought a revenue requirement of Rs160 billion for the indexation of tariff components and other costs for the year 2023-24. It has sought an amount of Rs20.9 billion for pay and allowances, Rs24 billion for post-retirement benefits, Rs78.3 billion for gross margin, and Rs72 billion on account of net margins.
Qesco has sought Rs236 billion in revenue requirements, which include Rs9.1 billion for pay and allowances, Rs2.68 billion for post-retirement benefits, Rs31.8 billion for gross margin, and Rs29 billion on account of net margins. Rs13.9 billion has been sought on account of a prior-year adjustment.
Tesco has sought a revenue requirement of Rs92 billion. It wants Rs1.47 billion for pay and allowances, Rs565 million for post-retirement benefits, Rs6.8 billion for gross margin, and Rs6.30 billion on account of net margins. Rs941 million and Rs8.17 billion are sought respectively as wheeling charges and a prior-year adjustment.
Pesco has sought Rs67.2 billion in revenue requirements, including Rs18.8 billion for pay and allowances, Rs14 billion for post-retirement benefits, Rs57.7 billion for gross margin, and Rs52.6 billion on account of net margins. Rs10.6 billion has been sought on account of a prior-year adjustment.
Sepco seeks a revenue requirement of Rs35.7 billion, including Rs20.6 billion for operation and maintenance costs, Rs1.8 billion for depreciation costs, Rs28.9 billion for gross margin, Rs26.5 billion on account of net margins, and Rs9.2 billion on account of a prior-year adjustment.
The DISCOs have approached Nepra to allow an increase in electricity rates to recover billions of rupees from consumers. The power regulator will hold a public hearing on these petitions on April 2

4,SC seeks details of restaurants on Margalla hills,"The National Park should be made available for public education and research, CJP","The Supreme Court on Thursday sought details of the Monal Restaurant as well as other restaurants on the Margalla Hills, emphasizing that the national park is for the people and that no commercial activity should be carried out there.
During the hearing of a case related to the lease of Monal Restaurant, the court was informed that more than 32 large and small restaurants and hotels have been established on the Margalla Hills.
The court stated that while these establishments would not be removed immediately, they would be given adequate time to comply.
The bench, led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, questioned how dining at Monal Restaurant at night and breaking the fast could serve a public purpose. It emphasized that the National Park should be made available for public education and research. The hearing was adjourned until after Eidul Fitr.

5,PML-N bigwigs to steer clear of by-polls race,"Party likely to award tickets to relatives of people who vacated PA, NA seats","In the lead-up to the upcoming by-elections in Punjab, there are no surprises on the horizon for the ruling party as its trusted hands step into the arena while the bigwigs, who lost their seats in the general elections, show little interest in running for seats vacated by senior leadership.
By-elections are scheduled to be held on twelve provincial assembly and two National Assembly seats in Punjab on April 21. These include eleven seats—nine provincial assembly and two NA seats—vacated by PML-N leaders or PML-N-backed candidates in order to retain their other seats.
In most instances, provincial assembly seats were relinquished to retain National Assembly seats with the exception of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, who retained her provincial assembly seat and relinquished her Lahore’s NA-119 seat.
The other National Assembly seat of the province—NA 132 Kasur—was relinquished by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who, in addition to this seat, also vacated his provincial assembly seats—PP-158 and PP- 164 in Lahore.
Other seats up for grabs include PP-149 Lahore (V), which was relinquished by PML-N-backed IPP President Abdul Aleem Khan; PP-147 Lahore (3) relinquished by Hamza Shehbaz; PP-139 Sheikhupura (V) vacated by Rana Tanveer Hussain; PP-32 Gujrat vacated by PML-N-backed PML-Q candidate Chaudary Salik Hussain; PP-22 Talagang vacated by Sardar Ghulam Abbas; PP-290 DG Khan relinquished by Sardar Awais Khan Leghari and and PP-54, vacated by Ahsan Iqbal.
At PP-266 Rahim Yar Khan, elections were delayed owing to the death of a candidate.
PP-93 Bhakkar (v) was vacated by PTI candidate Amir Inayat Shahani, while PP-36 Wazirabad was vacated by Muhammad Amad Chatha from PTI who instead retained his National Assembly seat NA-66.
With both governments in the Center and in Punjab standing on firm ground with a comfortable majority, the ruling party seems in no hurry to allot tickets. There are still ten more days available for allotment of party symbols and the party has ample time to announce these tickets.
According to several party leaders, including three serving ministers in Punjab, the PML-N might not have formally announced its tickets, but has already given assurances to certain aspirants.
It was revealed that Ali Pervez Malik, the son of the late PML-N leader Pervez Malik, will be contesting elections from NA-119, while Malik Rasheed, a relative of Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan, is set to contest from NA-132.
Former MPA Akhtar Hussain and Nawaz Jutt are likely to run for PP-164 Lahore and PP-158 Lahore respectively. Both of them have reportedly met with Shehbaz Sharif, according to sources.
Ticker for PP-149 Lahore, which was vacated by IPP president and Federal Minister Aleem Khan, is likely to be given to IPP leader Muhammad Shoaib Saddique.
Rana Aftab, brother of Rana Tanveer, is expected to contest from PP-139 Sheikhupura, while ticket for PP-54 Narowal, vacated by Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal, is likely to be given to his son Ahmad Iqbal.
Meanwhile, the PP-32 Gujrat, which was vacated by federal minister and PML-Q leader Salik Hussain, will now go to his cousin Musa Elahi.
PML-N bigwigs who had lost elections on February 8 showed no interest in running for the seats vacated by their party colleagues. On the other hand, those said to be in the running include a number of relatives of those who had originally won the seats.
From PP-290 DG Khan, Ali Ahmad Khan Leghari, the nephew of Sardar Awais Khan Leghari, is assured of a ticket.
Earlier there were speculations that a ticket for PP-147, a seat vacated by Hamza Shehbaz, would be given to former MPA Malik Shehbaz. However, of late there is chatter that the party is rethinking its options.
The panel of leaders said to be in the running include Malik Riaz, Chaudhary Shehbaz and even former interior Minister Rana Sanaullah.
According to sources, bigwigs of the party such as Rana Sanaullah, Khawaja Saad Rafique, Javed Latif, and Khurram Dastagir had the opportunity to contest from two NA seats but showed no interest, as they did not want to be part of this compromised government.
A source insisted that even Rana Sanaullah had originally shown no interest in contesting by-elections.
Asked why his name was being floated for a PP-147, he said he had no first-hand knowledge of this development. Another source said the reason these bigwigs want to stay away from this set-up is that they believe former prime minister Nawaz Sharif has been cornered by the establishment.
He claimed Nawaz’s brother Shehbaz Sharif was part of this conspiracy to corner the PML-N supreme leader.

7,LHC seeks proof Nawaz chairing govt meetings,Petitioner urged the court to prohibit the former prime minister from chairing any government,"The Lahore High Court (LHC) took up a petition on Thursday filed against the alleged chairing of Punjab government meetings by PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif.
The petitioner, Mashkoor Hussain, argued that Nawaz neither holds the position of Punjab chief minister nor that of a provincial minister. Additionally, he does not occupy any other role within the provincial government, yet he is presiding over provincial cabinet meetings.
The petitioner urged the court to prohibit the former prime minister from chairing any government meetings in the future.

During Thursday's proceedings, a single-member bench led by Justice Muzamil Akhtar Shabir asked the petitioner's counsel whether Nawaz officially issues instructions under his name and signature.
The petitioner's lawyer replied in the affirmative. ""According to the official press release, Nawaz Sharif directed the provincial government to introduce electric motorbikes and operate underground trains.""
The judge inquired where it is documented that Nawaz issued these directives during a cabinet meeting.
""Show us official documents to confirm that it was a cabinet meeting,"" he said.
The counsel argued that the press release and pictures were obtained from the official website of the Punjab government. However, the court directed the petitioner to submit official documents verifying that Nawaz chaired these official meetings.

8,Dar touts nuclear power as sustainable climate tool,FM tells Brussels summit nuclear energy offers viable solution for future,"Pakistan urged the international community on Thursday to provide nuclear power reactors, fuel and other associated infrastructure to the developing countries in accordance with safeguard obligations to further develop the use of clean and cost-effective energy.
Addressing the first ever Nuclear Energy Summit, organised by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Belgian government, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called for continued focus on safety, waste management, and proliferation issues.
Dar recalled that Pakistan endorsed nuclear energy as one of the low-emission technologies in the recent COP-28, adding that nuclear energy offered a viable solution for the future because of its negligible carbon footprints and no Greenhouse emissions.
Dar stressed on three points for further development of nuclear energy -- access to technology, financing nuclear power projects, and increasing IAEA technical cooperation fund. He added that Pakistan was ready to share its experience and expertise in peaceful uses of nuclear technology.
At the same time, Dar said that the world must continue to ensure focus on nuclear safety and security, waste management. “Small modular reactors hold the promise of bringing nuclear power to remote or underserved communities, providing access to clean and affordable energy,” he added.
He told the summit that Pakistan had fully trained human resource capable of supporting nuclear power infrastructure. “Our robust regulatory infrastructure ensures comprehensive safety and security of national nuclear installations and materials across all domains,” he added.
At the summit, leaders from pro-nuclear European countries and energy experts called for a nuclear energy revival, seeking to rebuild the European industry after years of gradual decline. The political push to expand nuclear is part of the drive to meet Europe’s ambitious climate targets.
However, European Union (EU) nations remain divided on whether to promote nuclear energy. One camp led by France believes nuclear expansion is crucial, while the other, including anti-nuclear Austria and Germany want the focus to stay on renewable sources such as wind and solar.
In a joint statement, countries committed “to work to fully unlock the potential of nuclear energy by taking measures such as enabling conditions to support and competitively finance the lifetime extension of existing nuclear reactors”.
The statement also commits to the construction of new nuclear power plants and the early deployment of advanced reactors, including small modular reactors worldwide while maintaining the highest levels of safety and security.
