1,Sindh witnesses outbreak of diarrhea and dysentery,"More than 181,000 cases have been reported so far this year, according to official figures","Sindh has seen an outbreak of diarrhea and dysentery in recent as more than 181,000 cases have been reported so far this year. Health practitioners attribute the surge in cases to contaminated water sources in the province.
As per official figures, there have been 78,518 cases of diarrhea, along with 26,232 cases of dysentery among children under the age of five in the past three months. Moreover, there have been 76,336 diarrhea cases among those older than five years. Three cases of cholera have been documented during this period.
Karachi's main government-run hospitals, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) and Civil Hospital, witness a daily influx of 25 to 30 patients suffering from diarrhea, cholera, and dysentery. This number continues to rise, with some patients presenting critical conditions due to severe dehydration.
Dr Irfan Siddiqui, the morning shift in-charge at JPMC, told The Express Tribune that the Accident and Emergency Department has recorded 1,910 cases of diarrhea and dysentery, with some unfortunate fatalities occurring despite medical intervention. He stressed the escalating prevalence of these cases, citing contaminated water and substandard food as primary contributors.
Dr Siddiqui also highlighted the heightened vulnerability of young children under five during the summer season and stressed the importance of consuming boiled water and maintaining a nourishing diet.
Microbiologist Dr Sadaf Akbar underlined the critical role of purified water in sustaining human health. Consumption of contaminated water poses significant risks, including the onset of diarrhea, cholera, hepatitis, and other potentially life-threatening illnesses.
Dr Sadaf said that gastrointestinal diseases are particularly prevalent in rural and suburban areas lacking adequate water purification systems, such as certain parts of Karachi. She stressed the imperative of boiling and filtering water before use, citing patient responses indicating a widespread neglect of this precautionary measure.
As cases of cholera and diarrhea escalate during the summer, Dr Sadaf cautioned against the consumption of untreated ice, beverages from unhygienic stalls, and water from tanker supplies, all of which pose serious health hazards if not properly treated.

3,Zaman takes rigging allegations to election tribunal,PTI leader raises concerns over the alleged manipulation of Form 45 and 47,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Former Parliamentary Leader at Sindh Assembly and NA-241 candidate, Khurrum Sher Zaman, on Friday has submitted the NA-241 rigging case to the election tribunal.
With unwavering hope and belief in the judicial system, Zaman is confident that justice will prevail, ensuring that the mandate of Karachi is rightfully returned to PTI.
Expressing his commitment to upholding democratic principles and fighting against electoral malpractice, Zaman stated, ""All necessary documentary and legal procedures have been diligently completed to present our case before the Election Tribunal. I remain optimistic that the esteemed judges of the Tribunal, as well as those in our Supreme Court and High Court, will uphold justice when the time comes.""
He raised concerns over the manipulation of Form 45 and 47, which led to his opponent Mirza Ikhtiar Baig from the PPP being declared the winner through unfair means.
“I received 79,530 votes while Baig got only 20,303. The ECP in its Form 45 robbed me of 30,920 votes to bring it down to 48,610 and enhanced Baig’s by 32,153 to 52,456 thus, declaring him the winner.”
Khurrum further emphasised that the blatant manipulation and theft of voters' mandate in NA-241 is unacceptable.
Khurrum reassured the citizens of Karachi that his party remains steadfast in its commitment to reclaim all rightfully won seats in Karachi.
Despite facing challenges and obstacles, the people of Karachi demonstrated their faith in PTI by casting their votes on February 8th, he said.
Zaman also called out PPP Co-Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari for accepting tainted victories based on Form 47, urging him to reflect on his party's commitment to democracy and fundamental rights.

6,WASA managing director removed over clogged sewers,Chief secretary says sewage overflowing on several important roads of city,"Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), Hyderabad, Managing Director Zahid Khemtio has been removed from his post in view of his alleged misconduct and poor performance. The Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah on Friday notified suspension of BS-19 Khemtio, who has served as MD WASA for two stints.
The first posting lasted for a year from April, 2021, to April, 2022. The second tenure, however, remained too fleeting with less than two months in office. He has been replaced by a senior officer of WASA, Zeeshan Malik, but with an acting charge.
In the notification, the CS stated Khemtio's 'misconduct' and 'utter failure' in performance of his official duties became the reason for his suspension. Shah, who appeared before the Sindh High Court Hyderabad Circuit Bench on Friday, noted that sewage was overflowing on several important roads of the city.
He went on to name some of those roads and said he found drainage flowing on the roads leading to the SHC and other courts, the Circuit House and other arteries in the city. ""Such serious lapses on part of WASA reflect adversely on performance of the entire government,"" the CS underlined.
The notification pointed out that even the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of Hyderabad complained to the CS against Khemtio. ""... about his non-responsive attitude towards his official duty.""
An official of WASA, who requested anonymity, claimed that Khemtio was reluctant to work as MD WASA. According to him, an influential political figure in Hyderabad brought him to that position days before the general election. However, some other officials of the agency complain about the attitude of Khemtio.
The WASA is responsible for the water supply and drainage network in Hyderabad. But complaints abound over supply of contaminated water and its shortage. WASA is also responsible for releasing untreated sewage in the Indus river and its canals.
The agency's employees resort to protest every other month, decrying inordinate delay or default in the payment of their salaries and pensions for several months. The organization has been surviving financially on the Sindh government provided bailout packages.
