0,Foreign loans remain low at $9.5b,Pakistan faces hurdles in way of securing funds from large multilateral lenders,"Pakistan received foreign loans of less than $9.5 billion during the first eight months of the current fiscal year and also faced problems in securing fresh loans from its two largest multilateral lenders.
Overall disbursements from foreign creditors slowed down during the July-February period of the current fiscal year despite Pakistan having the umbrella of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The government received only $318 million from foreign lenders in February.
The Economic Affairs Division on Thursday reported the latest disbursement figures. The data reported by the economic affairs ministry and the central bank showed that Pakistan secured nearly $9.5 billion in foreign loans during the first eight months of the current fiscal year. Pakistan also secured $6 billion in deposit rollovers from Saudi Arabia, China and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), taking total external sector inflows to $15.4 billion, or 62% of its needs.
The country received these loans in the shape of budget and balance of payments support as well as project financing. But the gross foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank remained at $8 billion despite purchasing more than $2 billion from the domestic market.
After facing problems in getting foreign commercial loans and floating Eurobonds, the federal government is also encountering difficulties in achieving the targets of fresh loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday met with the ADB country head and requested financial support during the current fiscal year as well as under the next IMF programme. The IMF money alone will not solve Pakistan’s fiscal woes.
The government received only $222 million from multilateral lenders in February, with the total tally standing at $2.6 billion for the current fiscal year. It still expects to receive $5.2 billion during the year. However, the target may be missed.
The ADB gave only $635 million in eight months, constituting 31% of the annual estimate of $2.1 billion. It seems that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs had set unrealistic targets at the time of announcement of the budget.
Aurangzeb highlighted the ADB’s assistance through policy-based lending to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and floods, according to a finance ministry statement. The status of policy-based programmes, including the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) programme and the Climate and Disaster Resilience Enhancement Programme (CDREP) was also discussed.
Pakistan has not yet met all the conditions agreed under the PPP and CDREP programmes. The government has not approved the PPP policy so far. Similarly, the conditions for CDREP have not been agreed and there is a lack of clarity on the role of different government ministries.
Sources said that as against the budgetary target of $2.1 billion in loans from the ADB, Pakistan may hardly receive $1.3 billion during the current fiscal year.
The country has not been successful in getting the Geneva pledges fully materialised for the victims of 2022 floods.
The World Bank was the largest lender after the IMF as it disbursed $1.4 billion in eight months. The IMF has given $1.9 billion out of a $3 billion loan package.
Pakistan has budgeted to receive $2.3 billion from the World Bank in this fiscal year and authorities hope to get at least $2 billion.
The government’s failure to fully utilise its borrowing options highlights poor budgeting and planning.
The Islamic Development Bank disbursed only $200 million in the current fiscal year out of the annual estimate of $500 million. Although Pakistan has fully tapped the budgeted $600 million Saudi oil facility, it did not receive any fresh funds last month.
The annual budget estimate for commercial loans is $4.5 billion while efforts to secure at least $600 million from China have not borne fruit.
China has linked its financing with a prior settlement plan for Rs515 billion that Pakistan owes to the Chinese power plants. Another Chinese commercial loan of $1 billion is maturing in June where Pakistan is seeking its rollover.
Finance Minister Aurangzeb voiced hope that the blocked commercial funding pipelines would be opened after the IMF approved its Extended Fund Facility.
Bilateral lenders extended $768 million to Pakistan during the July-February period, excluding rollovers.
Pakistan received $686 million from overseas Pakistanis as investment in the Naya Pakistan Certificates, exceeding the annual target.
The country is required to repay $11 billion in the remaining period of the current fiscal year. But it expects rollover of only $6 billion, leaving a gap of $5 billion.
The ministry is hoping to receive a $1.1 billion tranche from the IMF, some fresh support from the World Bank and the ADB to make up for the shortfall.
The central bank will also buy dollars from the market to support repayments and maintain reserves at current levels.

1,"Pakistan, ADB discuss uplift initiatives",ADB Country Director Young Ye met Minister of Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb,"Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Thursday discussed ongoing collaboration between the two sides in diverse areas and the future initiatives to be undertaken for economic development in the country that needs to progress rapidly to prop up the weakening economy and create jobs for the bulging workforce.
ADB Country Director Young Ye met Minister of Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb at the Finance Division where cooperation and future measures came up for discussion.
The country director congratulated the finance minister for reaching a staff-level agreement with the IMF-SBA under the $3 billion and stated that the market had positively responded to the development.
This agreement will lead to the release of the last loan tranche of $1.1 billion for Pakistan in March or April, following approval from the IMF’s executive board.
During the meeting, the finance minister expressed his appreciation for the support provided by the ADB over decades. He particularly highlighted the bank’s assistance through the Policy Based Lending facility to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and floods.

2,Business leaders urge action to ease economic strain,"Call for interest rate reduction, policy reforms to revitalise business landscape","Business leaders have appealed to the government and the finance ministry to swiftly reduce the interest rate to single digits and take measures to provide relief to businesspeople, traders, and industrialists. They caution that without such actions, all efforts for economic development would be in vain.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, representatives from various sectors, including industrialists, agriculturalists, auto manufacturers, auto dealers, traders, presidents of trade bodies, leaders of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), and the entire business community, expressed distress and put forward proposals to improve the economic condition.
They stressed the need for the central bank to prioritise core inflation over general inflation immediately, as this excludes the most volatile components of the inflation basket. They also advocate for lowering interest rates to open up new avenues and increase purchasing power.
Furthermore, they stress the need for the government to ensure the effectiveness of price control measures, establish a robust price control magistracy system, and take vigilant actions against hoarding.
Concerns are raised about the substantial increase in the unemployment rate due to poverty, which could lead to a rise in crimes. Instead of a decrease, commodity prices are soaring, making gas and electricity tariffs unaffordable even for affluent individuals. They point out that industrial consumers face non-competitive power tariffs and call for charging them the actual cost of electricity, estimated at Rs25.86 per kWh, while advocating for abolishing the cross-subsidisation mechanism hurting the national economy.
In light of a significant surge in capacity charges, amounting to 71.8% of the power purchase price for FY2023-24, urgent measures are deemed necessary, including renegotiating power purchase agreements with IPPs to extend the debt repayment period.
Chairman of the Pakistan Business Group, Farazur Rahman, criticised the decision to maintain the interest rate, stating it is unbearable for industries and will result in closures and halt new investments. He expressed disappointment over the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)’s announcement to keep the interest rate at 22%, attributing it to IMF pressure.
Rahman voiced dismay over the lack of relief measures for the industry, which local industrialists had been expecting. He underscored the importance of reducing the interest rate to stimulate the national economy and job creation, highlighting the need for affordable financing options for industrialists to sustain and expand their operations.
“We were all hopeful for a reduction in interest rates to stimulate the national economy and spur job creation. High interest rates hinder job opportunities,” remarked Muhammad Kamran Arbi, President of the Site Association of Industry. “Industrialists require loans for various purposes such as acquiring new machinery, securing working capital, and establishing new ventures. However, the lack of affordable financing options poses significant challenges. Given the current economic scenario, it’s difficult to find highly profitable businesses capable of offsetting the burden of elevated interest rates and loan costs,” he added.

3,SECP advances insurance RBC regime,Commissioner urges stakeholders to collaborate to align with global standards,"The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) conducted a session on Thursday for participants in the insurance industry to provide an overview of the Risk-Based Capital (RBC) regime and a walk-through of the recently disseminated RBC templates.
The meeting was attended by Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), finance and risk professionals from the insurance industry. It was also attended online by actuarial representatives and accounting experts from the Pakistan Society of Actuaries and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan, according to a news release.
Commissioner Insurance Aamir Khan briefed the participants on the importance of aligning the current solvency regime with international standards. He informed them that with the adoption of a more risk-based approach to capital and solvency requirements regionally and internationally, Pakistan is now perceived as an outlier by the global insurance industry.
As part of the strategic plan, he expressed his intent to leverage the alignment of insurance liabilities valuation, financial reporting under IFRS 17, and the RBC regime, which are key priority areas of a five-year strategic plan.
Advisor Insurance at SECP Falak S H Soomro provided an overview of the RBC implementation journey, including the development of the concept paper in December 2022 and the RBC template shared with the industry for data analysis.
Soomro informed participants that the RBC template is designed to assist companies in evaluating their risk exposures, conducting risk-based capital requirements analysis (commonly referred to as Quantitative Impact Study), and completing the model-validation process. A walk-through of the RBC templates about the technicalities and operationalities of the model was presented.

4,Profit-taking prevents PSX from crossing 66k,"KSE-100 index drops 314.39 points, settles at 65,417.40","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday gave up earlier gains as profit-taking kicked in, which snapped a three-day bull-run.
Earlier, trading commenced with a spike, when the KSE-100 index touched the intra-day high of 66,196.23 points over a staff-level agreement between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Pakistan.
However, the market could not sustain the gains and succumbed to the pressure of profit-booking.
A surge in T-bill yields in Wednesday’s auction undermined investors’ interest in the bourse, dragging the index below 66,000 points into negative territory. Resultantly, it hit the intra-day low of 65,326.01 towards the end of the session and closed in the red.
“Stocks closed bearish on a weak economic outlook,” said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp. “Surge in government’s treasury bond yields up to 60 basis points, dismal data of foreign direct investment that dropped 17.1% to $820.6 million in Jul-Feb FY24 and external financing challenges played the role of catalysts in bearish close at the PSX.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 314.39 points, or 0.48%, and settled at 65,417.40. Topline Securities’ Deputy Head of Sales considered “66,000 a stumbling block for the PSX”.
Pakistan equities initiated trading on a positive note. However, the benchmark index could not withstand the pressure at 66,000 due to profit-taking at the day’s high, he said. Resultantly, the KSE-100 entered the negative territory and closed at 65,417.
Increase in T-bills’ yields could likely be the reason for Thursday’s market reaction as it dented investors’ confidence a bit about the commencement of monetary easing, he said.
Exploration and production (E&P), technology and cement sectors contributed negatively to the index as Pakistan Petroleum, Systems Limited, Oil and Gas Development Company, Lucky Cement and Pioneer Cement lost 185 points.
On the flip side, National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), Fauji Fertiliser Company and MCB Bank saw some buying interest as they added 102 points. Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, commented that the “day’s high at 66,196 was met with excess supply that forced yet another retreat and kept the resistance at 66,000 intact”.
The Supreme Court dismissed a review application of NBP (+7.5%) pertaining to the payment of pensions to its retired employees. Dividends would now potentially be back on the table, which had been suspended since 2017 because of the case, it said.
Pakistan International Airlines (+7.5%) saw its sixth consecutive limit-up day. “For now, the index remains stuck between 65,000-66,000,” the AHL report added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 389.7 million shares against Wednesday’s tally of 341.8 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs11.3 billion.
Shares of 357 companies were traded. Of these, 115 stocks closed higher, 221 dropped and 21 remained unchanged.
Pakistan Telecommunication Company was the volume leader with trading in 52.9 million shares, losing Rs0.55 to close at Rs15.84. It was followed by Pakistan International Bulk Terminal with 41.98 million shares, gaining Rs0.1 to close at Rs6.05 and The Bank of Punjab with 29.1 million shares, gaining Rs0.16 to close at Rs5.44.
Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs500.3 million, according to the NCCPL.

5,Economic indicators improve on $3b IMF SBA,Research house says indicators suggest that overheated economy has stabilised,"Pakistan’s economic indicators have significantly improved under the ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF) Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) of $3 billion, suggesting that economic activities have stabilised and are ready to enter a growth phase ahead of the new loan package from the lender.
In its latest monthly update released on Thursday, Topline Research reported that the country’s key economic indicators, including the current account deficit (CAD), debt and liabilities, foreign exchange reserves, inflation reading, and rupee-dollar parity, improved in February 2024.
The report stated that Pakistan’s balance of the current account turned positive in February 2024, settling at a surplus of $128 million for the month compared to a deficit of $303 million in the previous month, January 2024.
Accordingly, the CAD for the first eight months (Jul-Feb) of the current fiscal year reduced to $999 million compared to $3.85 billion in the same period of the last year.
Similarly, Pakistan’s total debt and liabilities as a percentage of GDP stood at 85.3% in the second quarter of FY24, down from 90.38% in the last quarter of FY23.
The report elaborated that domestic debt as a percentage of GDP stood at 44.72% and external debt stood at 29.66% of GDP in the second quarter of FY24.
The country’s foreign exchange reserves (held by the State Bank of Pakistan) hit a five-week high, improving to over $8 billion in the week ended March 15, 2024. They grew cumulatively by $122.2 million in the latest two weeks to $8.02 billion, recovering from a recent two-month low at $7.89 billion as of March 1, 2024.
The reserves are estimated to increase to $9 billion to $10 billion by the end of the current fiscal year on June 30, 2024. Pakistan’s CPI inflation stood at 23.06% in February 2024 compared to 28.34% in January 2024, better than industry expectations. This is also the lowest inflation in 20 months and down from a multi-decade high of 38% seen in May 2023.
On a month-on-month basis, CPI inflation remained flat with just a 0.03% rise in February 2024 compared to an increase of 1.8% in January 2024. In the eight months of FY24, average inflation remained elevated at 28.03% compared to 26.16% in the same period of the last year, according to the research house.
Moreover, the rupee-dollar parity has remained stable for the past several months, with the domestic currency hitting a five-month high at Rs278.39/$ on Thursday, regaining over 10% in the past six-and-a-half months to date.
While speaking to The Express Tribune, Sunny Kumar, the Deputy Head of Research at the firm, stated that maintaining economic discipline under the ongoing IMF loan programme of $3 billion helped the nation improve its economic indicators from worsening amid the failure to resume the previous $6.5 billion programme in June 2023. He noted that the current economic indicators suggest that the economy has stabilised from being overheated two years ago, supporting the gradual ramping up of economic activities to achieve sustainable economic growth going forward.
Kumar stated that his research house anticipates growth at 3% in the current fiscal year 2024, with major support coming from the agriculture sector. The economy had contracted by 0.3% in FY23.
“We foresee economic growth further expanding to 3.5% in the next fiscal year 2024-25, with broader support coming from all three major sectors, including agriculture, industries, and services,” Kumar said.
A further deceleration in inflation would allow the central bank to cut its benchmark interest rate and provide cheaper banking finance to the private sector, which would help increase industrial activities.
He added that the better economic indicators should help the nation secure a new IMF loan programme on better conditions.
However, the IMF would recommend the government to increase revenue collection by taxing the untaxed sectors, including agriculture, real estate, wholesale, and retail sectors.
Besides, it would ask to increase energy (power and gas) tariffs and increase the petroleum development levy to Rs100/litre from Rs60/litre at present.

6,"Pakistan, UK to launch trade dialogue",Outline strategies to bolster trade relations,"Pakistan and the United Kingdom will soon launch a trade dialogue aimed at fortifying trade and investment relations between the two countries.
Federal Minister of Commerce Jam Kamal Khan stated this in a meeting with British High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott where key strategies were outlined to bolster the already robust trade relations between Pakistan and the UK.
The minister emphasised the deep-rooted political and historical ties between the nations and the significant strides made in trade. He praised the Developing Countries Trading Scheme, initiated in June 2023, as a pivotal opportunity for Pakistan to amplify trade volumes with the UK.
The high commissioner talked about the promising trajectory of bilateral trade, with Pakistan’s exports to the UK registering a steady growth. Earlier, Marriott expressed her willingness to collaborate with the new government, especially in the area of climate financing.
She said climate change and its dangers were a big problem but pointed out that Pakistan had no role in creating the problem. Still, the country is ranked eighth among the countries most affected by the climate crisis. Moreover, it ranks 32nd in terms of preparedness. “To meet these challenges, money is needed, which Pakistan cannot acquire alone, so we will work with the government for climate financing.”

7,Foreign currency reserves rise to five-week high,Improved reserves help rupee to remain at five-month peak,"Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves, held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), hit a five-week high above $8 billion as the central bank apparently absorbed surplus US dollars in the inter-bank market.
Healthy inflows of foreign currency helped the rupee gain Rs0.02, which closed at a new five-month high at Rs278.39/$ in the inter-bank market.
In the open market, the currency surged Rs0.22 and reached Rs280.90/$, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).
In addition, gold climbed to a six-and-a-half-month high at Rs232,400 per tola (11.66 grams) in line with the trend in global markets where the precious metal touched a new peak.
According to the latest weekly update released by the SBP, its foreign exchange reserves increased $105 million to $8.02 billion in the week ended March 15, 2024.
The reserves improved apparently in the wake of bank buying of US dollars in the inter-bank network, where supply of the foreign currency remained higher than its demand.
Exporters have continued to sell the greenback on futures counters while overseas Pakistanis have sent higher remittances to their family members and friends back home to help them meet increasing expenditures during the fasting month of Ramazan and the Eid festival. Meanwhile, the foreign exchange reserves held by commercial banks increased $134.4 million to $5.37 billion.
Accordingly, the total reserves held by the country rose $239.4 million and stood at $13.39 billion in the week ended March 15, 2024.
The gradual increase in the country’s reserves, coupled with a successful last review under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $3 billion standby arrangement and talks for a new and larger loan programme, supported the Pakistani rupee to remain firm in both currency markets.
On the other hand, gold price surged Rs4,600, pushing the commodity to a six-and-a-half-month high at Rs232,400 per tola. Bullion soared $20 to $2,225 per ounce (31.10 grams) in the international market after the US central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at significantly higher levels at 5.25-5.50%, but hinted at three rate cuts in calendar year 2024.

8,"New taxpayer zones in Balochistan, K-P approved","Aim to provide special tax incentives, benefits, and streamlined processes to large taxpayers","The federal government has decided to establish two special large taxpayer zones in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P). These zones will be set up within the limits of the Regional Tax Office (RTO) Quetta and Regional Tax Office (RTO) Peshawar. The Board in Council of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has approved the establishment of these zones. Member Inland Revenue Operations and member admin and human resource have been tasked with implementing the decision, with all other FBR members also responsible for its execution.
According to documents obtained by The Express Tribune, in a recent meeting of the FBR Board in Council chaired by Chairman FBR Malik Amjad Zubair Tawana, Mir Badshah Khan Wazir, Member Inland Revenue Operations, presented the case for establishing these special large taxpayer zones in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Member Inland Revenue Operations briefed the FBR Board in Council about pending litigation in the Supreme Court of Pakistan concerning the transfer of jurisdiction of several taxpayers from one office to another.
In the meeting, the FBR Board in Council extensively reviewed the issue of establishing these zones and discussed the legal aspects and actual position of the matter. It was reiterated that the powers and functions delegated by the Federal Board of Revenue under the FBR Act, 2007, encompass strategic, policy, and operational matters. Operational decisions are delegated to members to facilitate taxpayers and ensure timely decision-making, while strategic and policy decisions remain within the purview of the FBR Board in Council.
After thorough examination, the FBR has approved the establishment of two Special Large Taxpayer Zones within the jurisdiction of the Regional Tax Office (RTO) Quetta and Regional Tax Office (RTO) Peshawar. The FBR Board in Council has directed the Member Inland Revenue Operations to issue necessary notifications in this regard.
The current practice of delegating operational and functional powers of the board to respective members will persist, with strategic and policy-level decision-making under the FBR Act 2007 and Rule 3 of FBR Rules 2007 remaining the responsibility of the FBR Board in Council.

9,PM takes charge of FBR overhaul,Over 80% of bank accounts in Pakistan remain undeclared to tax authorities,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has decided to lead the reform process in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) himself amid the startling revelation that over 80% of bank accounts in Pakistan are not declared to the tax authorities.
The prime minister has appointed himself as the chairman of the Steering Committee, which will oversee the implementation of the approved FBR reforms plan. A separate implementation committee has already been notified three days ago under the chairmanship of the finance minister.
Sharif’s decision to chair the steering committee underscores the priority he attaches to bringing reforms to a system that, according to former Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar, causes trillions of rupees less revenue collection annually.
The premier was informed in a recent meeting that “less than 20% of bank accounts appear in tax returns filed with the FBR,” as shown by official documents.
It is an alarmingly low number, indicating that the FBR has no idea about the wealth and sources of wealth parked in over 80% of bank accounts. The existing law obliges commercial banks to share the details of bank account holders and their credit card details with the FBR. However, banks do not comply with the law, posing a challenge for the new finance minister, who is a banker, to enforce the law in letter and spirit.
Details from the meeting held at the PM’s house suggest unanimity between the previous cabinet and the prime minister regarding reforms in the FBR.
PM Sharif was fully convinced that separating the Inland Revenue Service and the Customs Organisations was the correct approach, based on a presentation given by former Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar two weeks ago.
In the meeting, the PM decided to personally monitor the implementation of the approved reform plan, as increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio will remain a core priority for the government.
The prime minister will chair the steering committee, with the ministers for Finance, Commerce, Industries & Production, and Law and Justice as its members. Other members include the secretaries of the Finance Division, Ministry of Industry, Revenue Division, Ministry of Commerce, and the Board of Investment. The chairman of FBR has not been made a member of the steering committee.
The committee will assess the implementation status of the approved FBR reforms plan and issue directives to facilitate the expeditious implementation of the FBR reform agenda.
The finance division will provide secretarial support to the committee and take further necessary action for the notification of the committee’s jurisdiction.
During a meeting on the FBR’s reform initiative, the PM was informed that currently only 2.4% of the population files returns as against 6% in India. Out of these, 55.6% are Nil filers – paying no taxes. Just 3.3% of taxpayers account for 90% of income tax collection.
The PM was informed that Pakistan’s current tax-to-GDP ratio stood at 11.4%, with an existing gap equivalent to 7.6% of GDP.
Former finance minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar believed that the actual requirement of the government is to mobilise revenues up to 24% of GDP. However, she looks at the public debt problem only through the prism of revenues, completely ignoring the irrationality in expenditures.
According to the FBR’s restructuring plan, Customs and Internal Revenue will be separated. Both organisations will be headed by respective director generals and brought under the governance structure of oversight boards. Both organisations will work under the Revenue Division.
A tax policy board will be established, headed by the finance minister, to deal with tax policy issues, revenue targets, coordination, integrity policy, industry consultation, valuation policy, and digitalisation. There will be a Tax Policy Office within the Revenue Division to conduct research, analysis, and develop budget proposals to promote data-driven and equitable taxation for reducing tax expenditure.
The Tax Policy Office will be staffed by professionals with analytical, financial modelling, and IT capacities.
The former finance minister further explained the rationale for a separate Customs organisation, citing it as an international best practice, with 73% of tax administrations organised under this model.
The meeting proceedings revealed that the FBR’s automation process was still at level one and for complete transformation, it has to reach level three, where it becomes fully automated.
It was also underscored in the meeting that revenue administration needs to develop a data access and management system and strong protocols for data sharing.
