0,Judiciary’s approach towards PTI changing?,Granting of bail to five people allegedly involved in May 9 riots triggers debate,"Following the granting of bail to five people allegedly involved in last year’s May 9 violence, a debate has set off as to whether or not a breeze of change had begun to blow through the superior courts towards the PTI.
The party has been unable to acquire relief from the superior judiciary, especially the Supreme Court, during the tenure of Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa.
The majority of the accused involved in the May 9 mayhem could not receive bail from the high courts -- the Lahore High Court in particular.
A larger bench of the apex court led by Justice Ijazul Ahsan on October 23, 2023 declared that the trial of civilians in military courts was “unconstitutional”.
Of the five judges on that bench, four of them belonged to ex- CJP Umar Ata Bandial's camp.
Subsequently, the government challenged the larger bench’s judgment. It was suspended by another larger bench led by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood.
The bench even conditionally allowed the trial of civilians in military courts until the final decision on the government’s intra court appeals against the earlier judgment.
Later, Justice Masood on January 29 recused from the bench hearing the government’s intra-court appeals as the petitioners raised objections about him.
Since Justice Masood’s recusal, a new bench is yet to be formed even though some applications have been moved for the early hearing of the case.
However, another SC bench led by Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail has given important observations in the matter of bail related to the accused involved in the May 9 riots.
Similarly, Islamabad High Court’s Justice Babar Sattar has convicted the Islamabad deputy commissioner and others in a contempt case for repeatedly issuing and executing successive detention orders issued against PTI leader Shehryar Afridi.
Another division bench of the IHC led by its Chief Justice Aamer Farooq is raising questions on the manner in which the trial of PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan was conducted in the cipher case.
Despite the executive’s restrictions, the IHC also allowed PTI lawyers to hold meetings with Imran.
It has also been learnt that during a full court meeting at the LHC, one judge called for the improvement of the high court's image.
The PTI’s female activists, who are accused in the May 9 riots, are still behind bars.
Advocate Abdul Moiz Jaferii said there was a growing sense in both the bar and bench that a measure of credibility in the judiciary must be restored.

“At no point since the lawyers movement has the judicial system been less relevant to the national political equation than it is today,” he added.
Jaferii continued that the orders are passed by the top court.
“If they [orders] are disliked, they are ignored. Benches are formed that ignore this past ignorance and suspend their own earlier orders without consequences. We have brought ourselves here. We must take ourselves out [of this situation].”
Another senior lawyer was of the view that the superior courts had adopted the approach of “judicial silence” for the last six months.
“There is a perception that courts are becoming irrelevant as state institutions have been given a free hand to deal with matters related to civil liberties,” he added.
“Since the new government has been formed, there will be a change in the judges’ approach to adjudicate politically sensitive matters.”
However, the senior lawyer believed that there would not be a major shift in the judiciary's policy.
First, he pointed out that the chief justices of the constitutional courts were crucial in challenging the status quo.
Secondly, he observed that the judges, who were questioning the executive’s policy towards the May 9 violence, were not in the driving seat.
“The composition of benches is always important to deal with high-profile cases.”
Another lawyer said it seemed the executive authorities were not rigorously pleading cases related to the May 9 mayhem after the February 8 general elections.
During the caretaker government’s tenure, the superior courts adopted judicial restraint on the state institutions policy towards the May 9 riots.
He said the PTI was already facing internal differences and now it was no longer a major threat for the ‘powerful circles'.
“Therefore, now it won’t make a major difference if the PTI acquires some relief from the courts.”

1,IHC queries ban on Imran’s visitation,"Justice Ejaz says how Punjab CM ordered online meeting facility at Kot Lakhpat, when Jail Manual does not allow it","The Islamabad High Court (IHC) questioned the statement provided by the Adiala Jail superintendent to the court, asserting that jail regulations did not allow for online meetings between Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and his legal representatives.
Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan of the IHC raised concerns regarding the denial of this facility, juxtaposing it with the announcement made by the Punjab chief minister regarding online meetings at Kot Lakhpat Jail.
He questioned the inconsistency, highlighting the discrepancy between the Jail Manual and its implementation across different facilities.
Justice Khan took up the request of the PTI founder for meeting with his lawyers. State lawyer Abdur Rehman requested time to seek instructions from the government on the matter. Meanwhile, another lawyer, Zainab Janjua, emphasized the need for alignment between the Adiala Jail superintendent's stance and that of the Punjab government.
However, the judge declined the request, saying there was no need for instructions, adding that the court would settle one point: whether or not political discussion could be held in jail meeting. If the court came to conclusion that political talks could take place, then amendment would have to be made.

PTI founder’s lawyer Sher Afzal Marwat told the court that they had been stopped one and a half kilometres away from where they walked to the Adiala Jail. Justice Khan remarked that everyone knew what this was all about. He added that if the orders to jail authorities stopped, this would end.
Justice Khan said that if 200 senior civil officers refused to obey illegal orders, the system will be fixed. However, he quipped that if the court sent 200 civil servants to jail, even then there would be improvement. The judge said if 200-300 officers give sacrifice for the ideology, things would improve.
The judge pointed out that the jail superintendent had said meetings with the prisoners had been stopped from March 12 because of threat alerts, saying that he did not see this order as bona fide. He pointed out that there would be a big parade on March 23 (today), yet there was no threat to it.
The court urged the advocate general to clarify whether the Punjab chief minister's announcement or the jail authorities' directive was illegal, setting the stage for further deliberation on March 29.
Meanwhile, a local court of Islamabad ordered the production of the PTI founder Imran Khan and senior leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the court on April 20 in a case related to vandalism registered against them in Karachi Company Police Station.
During the hearing, PTI lawyers, Sardar Mohammad Kharji Khan, Naeem Haider Panjotha and others appeared in the court of Civil Judge Mureed Abbas. The court ordered the production of the two and adjourned further hearing till April 20.

3,IHC former judge regains his honour,SC overturns SJC’s October 2018 notification proposing Justice Siddiqui’s removal,"In an unprecedented decision, the Supreme Court has overturned the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC)'s October 2018 notification, which led to the dismissal of Islamabad High Court (IHC) senior puisne judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui. The dismissal stemmed from serious allegations leveled by Siddiqui against a former spy chief.
Hearing Siddiqui’s appeal against his sacking, a five-judge larger bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa on Friday ruled that during the misconduct proceedings initiated against the former IHC judge, the SJC deprived him of his fundamental rights of fair trial and due process.
In his speech at Rawalpindi Bar Council on July 21, 2018, Justice Siddiqui had accused former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed and some other officials of trying to manipulate the IHC benches as well as the accountability courts that work under the high court.
Around a week after the event, the SJC initiated misconduct proceedings against the IHC judge for purportedly breaching the judge’s code of conduct. The council on October 11, 2018 recommended his removal.
The former judge later approached the apex court against the SJC order. However, his appeal against the council’s verdict was taken up only after Justice Isa assumed office as the chief justice of Pakistan.
A five-member bench led by Justice Isa heard the appeal and reserved its order on January 23.
On Friday, the bench unveiled its 23-page detailed order, setting aside the SJC’s October 11, 2018 report/opinion—submitted to the president and Notification No F.9(2)/2018-A.II, dated October 11, 2018 issued on the advice of the prime minister and his cabinet of ministers.
“Consequently, Justice Siddiqui shall be deemed to have retired as a judge of the IHC and he will be entitled to receive all the benefits and privileges due to a retired judge, by allowing these petitions in the above terms,"" said the order authored by CJ Isa.
The order noted that “unfortunately” the delay that occurred in hearing and deciding these petitions meant that in the interregnum Justice Siddiqui attained the age of sixty-two years, at which age a judge of the high court retires. Therefore, Justice Siddiqui cannot be restored to the position of judge.
The judgement said Justice Siddiqui had undoubtedly levelled very serious allegations against Gen Faiz Hameed and a few of his subordinates. However, Justice Siddiqui was not given an opportunity to establish his allegations nor was he brought face to face with those he had accused.
“When we noted this lapse we issued notices to all those against whom he made allegations and provided them with an opportunity to admit/deny them.
“All of them have denied their stated involvement. Therefore, it was all the more necessary for the SJC to have inquired into the matter and to have determined who was telling the truth,” it said.
According to the verdict, the SJC did not give any credence to Justice Siddiqui’s own words and to the contents of his replies; the SJC assumed that these allegations were false; and having made this assumption concluded that Justice Siddiqui was guilty of misconduct.  It said it would be difficult to categorize such a determination as fair or one which accorded with the requirements of due process.
“Justice Siddiqui was not given an opportunity to establish the veracity of his allegations, which was incumbent on the SJC when the same formed the basis of Justice Siddiqui’s removal from office.”
The court noted that the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution include the right to a fair trial and due process (Article 10A) and all citizens, including judges, must be dealt with in accordance with it.

“However, Justice Siddiqui was deprived of his fundamental rights of fair trial and due process. Article 209 does not stipulate that in determining whether a judge is guilty of misconduct he is denuded of the fundamental rights nor permits the SJC to act contrary to them.”
It said in all prior cases when proceedings were initiated against judges which resulted in their removal from office it was done after the recording of evidence.
Evidence was recorded in the case of Justice Akhlaque Hussain before rendering the opinion that he should be removed from his office.  In the case of Justice Shaukat Ali, the SJC recorded evidence of witnesses before formulating its opinion and recommending his removal.
And, in the recent case of Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi the SJC recorded the testimony of 14 witnesses, who produced a number of documents, opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses was granted, and only then did the SJC find that Naqvi was guilty of misconduct and should have been removed as a judge
""In not holding an inquiry, by not providing Justice Siddiqui an opportunity to establish his allegations and without recording of evidence, it cannot be stated that Justice Siddiqui had received a fair trial and that due process requirements were met,” it said.
The verdict said the former judge was also not dealt with in accordance with law, as prescribed by Article 4 of the Constitution and his reputation was tarnished.
""Transgressions the bar of jurisdiction contained in Article 211 of the Constitution would not be applicable in the instant case since the action, as it was taken, against Justice Siddiqui constituted mala fide and the SJC had acted coram non judice,” it said.
The verdict said if a judge is removed without even inquiring into the allegations levelled by or against him the independence of judiciary will receive a severe setback.


It said the SJC did not specify which particular provision or aspect of the said four Articles of the Code of Conduct, or of any other, Justice Siddiqui had violated and had persuaded the SJC to opine that he was guilty of misconduct.
""Justice Siddiqui had leveled serious allegations and these were noted in the impugned Report/Opinion which included that the then Major General Faiz Hameed, DG-C of ISI, and some of his subordinates had wanted cases ‘pertaining to Faizabad sit-in, BOL Media Group, AXACT’ and those of Mr. Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, former Prime Minister of Pakistan, and his daughter, Ms. Maryam Nawaz Sharif, to be decided in a particular manner.
“If the SJC after conducting an inquiry had determined that Justice Siddiqui had levelled false allegations he would have been guilty of misconduct, but without inquiring into the matter it could not be said that he had levelled false allegations,” it said.
The court said it could not be unmindful of the fact that two complaints—one from the then Chief of Army Staff and another from the Government of Pakistan—wanted “to initiate proper legal process to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and take action accordingly”.
“An inquiry was all the more necessary since neither the Chief of Army Staff’s Secretariat nor the Government of Pakistan had determined the veracity of the allegations. Justice Khosa too in his initial opinion had stated ‘that the matter requires an inquiry by the Supreme Judicial Council’,” it added.
