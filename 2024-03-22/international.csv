0,A day in the life of a polio worker,Health guardians’ dedication ensures hope in communities,"Accompanying the dedicated polio worker, Noor Jahan, on her rounds in the vibrant nomadic community was an eye-opening experience. As we traversed unpaved rough terrain, the adorable sight of beautiful yet grubby children, adorned in vivid traditional attire, following us from door to door filled me with a sense of purpose. Witnessing their eyes light up with joy upon receiving the crucial vaccine underscored the significance of our mission.
Despite the long distances and physical exhaustion evident in Noor Jahan’s demeanor, her kindness and dedication never wavered. A widow at a young age, she found herself at the crossroads of despair and responsibility, yet she pressed on, holding the hand of her 11-year-old daughter.
In the midst of our journey, I had the opportunity to witness a heartfelt exchange between Noor Jahan and a hesitant mother. After a persuasive dialogue that spanned nearly 20 minutes, the mother’s initial reluctance softened, and she embraced the importance of protecting her child from polio. Noor Jahan’s patience and empathy in these moments left a lasting impression on me.
“Some parents softened quickly, while some gave us a very tough time,” Noor Jahan remarked, her words tinged with a mixture of weariness and determination. “Their weird expressions and harsh sentences sometimes demotivate me, but the innocence and smiles of the little champs revive my energy and I continue to work.”
Accompanying Noor Jahan as a journalist reaffirmed my admiration for the resilience and dedication of polio workers. Their efforts are not only crucial in maintaining polio-free status but also in fostering community trust and resilience.
The Provincial head of Emergency Operations Center Balochistan Syed Zahid Shah praised the exemplary work of frontline workers like Noor Jahan, emphasizing the importance of their efforts in protecting the health of children. He urged communities to understand the sensitivity of the issue, emphasizing that any child could be vulnerable to the polio virus without proper vaccination.
“As we reflect on Balochistan’s three-year polio-free status, it’s clear that the contributions of frontline workers cannot be overstated. However, the recent cases in Dera Bugti and Chaman serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges in the fight against polio. It is imperative that we continue to support and amplify the voices of polio workers as they strive to protect the health of future generations.” He urged communities to understand the sensitivity of the issue as polio environmental samples is circulating around us, emphasizing that any child could be vulnerable to the polio virus without proper vaccination.

1,Privileges of former secretaries withdrawn,"Some officials are still in control of the resources of the department and its allied projects, Adviser CM K-P","Adviser to Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Tourism, Culture and Archeology, Zahid Chanzeb, on Thursday ordered ending all privileges provided to the former secretaries of the tourism department, heads of area authorities and project directors after their transfers from the department.
In a high-level meeting of the department, he expressed his concern that some officials are still in control of the resources of the department and its allied projects after their transfer to other departments, adding that this work is equivalent to raising white elephants on the hard earned taxes of the poor people.
He said that Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has set a glaring example on day one by withdrawing security and other privileges from the former chief ministers because, he said, the influential people don’t deserve it. He made it clear that the vehicles, staff, laptops and other equipment could only be utilized by the officials associated with this department.

2,Standoff persists in K-P over PA session,Governor calls sitting; govt seeks legal opinion,"An ongoing tussle between Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Governor Haji Ghulam Ali and Pakistan Tahreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government has deepened over convening the provincial assembly session.
Official sources told The Express Tribune that the governor had mentioned that Articles 109, 105 and 48 of the Constitution in his notification but the provincial government sought legal opinion from experts on the matter.
The tussle started between the two sides over the issue of administrating oath to the newly-announced female assembly members (MPAs) on reserved seats. “The Law Department has been asked to give its opinion over the matter as soon as possible,” said an official.
According to the official, the department had been directed to give its opinion over the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) March 4 notification and the oath-taking of the females and minorities’ members.
Background
On Wednesday Governor Haji Ghulam Ali called the provincial assembly session, using his special powers after the speaker declined to administer oath to the newly-notified women MPAs on reserved seats. He directed the assembly secretary to call the session on 3pm Friday.
This is the first time that Governor Ghulam Ali has used his special powers to call the assembly session. In the routine, a summery is sent to the governor by the provincial Law Department for convening of the session. There is also a possibility the governor can call the session if he feels that chief minister should take the vote of confidence.
In his notification, Governor Ghulam Ali took the stance that the assembly session was being called on the request of opposition leader Dr Ehabadullah to enable the newly-named MPAs on the reserved seats to take oath.
“The opposition leader has recommended that the session of the assembly should be called so that MPAs on reserved seats could take oath. He said that the provincial government has decided not to call the session so that the newly notified minorities and women MPAs could not take oath,” the notification said.
“He requested the governor to take notice of the situation and call the session of the assembly so that these MPAs could take oath of their office,” it added.
The notification sent by the Governor Secretariat to the Provincial Assembly Secretary, using his special constitutional powers under Article 109, called the assembly session on March 22, (today). In the assembly session oath would be administered to females and minorities MPAs.
Political observers consider it yet another stand-off between the PTI government in the K-P and federal government.
Earlier, K-P Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur stayed away from the official functions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during PM’s visit to Peshawar on March 3, indicating a cold war between the two sides, which is definitely not a good sign for the province. Gandapur also stayed away from the oath-taking ceremony of the prime minister.
