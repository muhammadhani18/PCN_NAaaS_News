1,PTI founder’s photo disrupts PA,Opposition leader opens debate on Punjab budget,"The lawmakers from the treasury benches briefly ‘boycotted’ the Punjab Assembly proceedings on Thursday after a picture of PTI’s founding chairman Imran Khan was placed on the desk of the opposition leader temporarily nominated by the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).
Opposition Leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar was to open the general discussion on the budget for 2023-4 presented by the provincial government.
However, the treasury and opposition lawmakers came at loggerheads over the picture as the PML-N members called for its removal, while the SIC legislators said no one could dare to touch it.
After a long spell of sloganeering against each other and exchange of fiery arguments, PML-N MPA Malik Muhammad Waheed Khan said he and other members of his party would walk out of the session if the SIC members would not remove the picture.
PML-N MPA Sami Ullah Khan tried to pacify the situation but Food Minister Bilal Yaseen signaled Waheed Khan to walk out, following the treasury members left the house.
Deputy Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar adjourned the house proceedings for 10 minutes after the walkout.
As the session resumed, Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman clarified that no one from the government had walked out of the house.
Starting the budget debate, Opposition Leader Bhachar questioned its credibility and termed it anti-people.
He said the government had no mandate to present the budget of over four months of the preceding caretaker government.
He said no attention had been given to education in remote areas. He said the allocation of a meagre amount of Rs57 billion for primary education was tantamount to making a mockery of the sector. The amount should be spent on the schools in remote areas, he stressed.
The opposition leader lamented that only Rs200 million had been allocated for skill development of the youth who number 700 million in the province. Thus the amount comes down to Rs2.75 for every youth.
He said the government had decided to establish a cancer hospital with a meagre amount of Rs440 million, which meant that it was not serious in completing the project even in 10 years.
He also lambasted the government upon earmarking Rs440 million for an air ambulance service. There was no ambulance available even at district and tehsil hospitals but the government was claiming of launching air ambulance, he added.
He said various sections of the society were deprived of their basic rights of education, health and infrastructure, but the government claimed to have presented people-friendly budget.
The opposition leader alleged that the Ramazan package was confined to social media.
“The deserving masses are being disgraced and their dignity is being compromised through cameras and pictures,” he alleged.
He said that government had claimed that it would supply 300 electricity units free to the people but had instead allocated billions of rupees for the houses to its leaders.
Regarding the allocation of Rs1 billion for the welfare of journalists, he said they needed freedom of expression and an independent atmosphere wherein no one of them could be killed like senior journalist Arshad Sharif.
The opposition leader said flawed official policies had affected agricultural growth.
Several members from the PML-N and SIC participated in the discussion but most speakers from the ruling parties focused on political speeches rather than responding to the criticism on the budget.

3,Police stumped by five mysterious murders in Gujranwala,One headless body was found in fields,"The city police have failed to trace those who brutally killed five people in Gujranwala even after lapse of two months.
Among the victims, three young individuals were kidnapped and killed, one was discovered dead in a sack, and another was slain on a road.
Despite ongoing investigations by law enforcement, the perpetrators behind these heinous acts continue to evade justice.
One victim, Wasim Parvez, who recently returned to Pakistan from Greece after 15 years, met a tragic end within just a month of his arrival.
While riding a motorcycle with his cousin in the Nawan Pind area of Arup police station, Wasim fell victim to a targeted killing.
The assailants ruthlessly fired multiple bullets at him, separating him from his cousin and ultimately claiming his life.
Despite the existence of CCTV footage capturing the incident, authorities have struggled to uncover concrete evidence in the case, leaving Wasim's family bereft of closure.
Similarly, in February, Salman, a 22-year-old resident of the Abdal neighbourhood, was abducted and later found dead with severed head in a nearby field. Although a kidnapping report was filed with the police, no substantial evidence has been gathered in the murder investigation.
Inspector Armaghan, overseeing the Homicide Unit, expressed concerns that one of the victims, a liberal young man, may have been targeted in the name of honour.
He said despite the challenging circumstances, law enforcement officials have assured the public that these cases remain a top priority.
In another case, Zeeshan, a factory worker, was abducted, prompting his family to receive a ransom demand of Rs5 million. Despite their efforts to comply with the demand, Zeeshan's lifeless body was discovered the following day, further underscoring the rampant lawlessness plaguing the region.
Meanwhile, in the Muridke neighbourhood of Lahore, the lifeless body of Bilal, a young man from the Jhangi neighbourhood, was found with his hands and feet bound.
Police claimed to have detaining two suspects and expressing optimism about its eventual resolution.
In a separate incident, the unidentified body of a 50-year-old man was discovered in a sack in Ladhewala, Waraich, adding to the growing list of unsolved mysteries haunting the community.
Despite the tireless efforts of law enforcement agencies, several cases remain unresolved, leaving families clamouring for justice.
As the search for answers continues, residents remain hopeful that those responsible for these senseless acts of violence will be swiftly apprehended and brought to justice, bringing much-needed closure to grieving families and restoring a sense of security to the city of Gujranwala.
