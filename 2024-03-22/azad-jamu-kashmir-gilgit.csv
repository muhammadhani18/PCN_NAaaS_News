0,Rains reduce air pollution index,Air quality index in Islamabad decreased from 110 to 70 levels while Rawalpindi recorded a reduction to 68,"Heavy downpours in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad on Thursday not only made the weather pleasant but also significantly reduced the air pollution index.
Following the downpour, the air quality index in Islamabad decreased from 110 to 70 levels while Rawalpindi recorded a reduction to 68. In other districts of Rawalpindi division, the air pollution index measured 119 in Jhelum, 115 in Attock and 116 in Chakwal. The air pollution index in Murree stood at 97.
Due to the rain, the water level in the three dams Rawal Dam, Khanpur Dam and Simli Dam which supply water to Rawalpindi and Islamabad has also started increasing. The catchment areas of all three dams are full of water. There was a low flood water level in the Nullah Leh due to the overnight rain, which cleared the Nullah Leh.
The wheat crop in the region benefited from the rain, with improvements observed in seasonal vegetable cultivation as well.
Rawalpindi Agriculture Department’s spokesperson Haroon Ahmed said that the wheat crop has improved due to the three rains last month in Rawalpindi Division. Rawalpindi is likely to have a bumper crop of wheat this year.

1,Pollen count soars in twin cities,Meteorological experts warn that pollen levels are expected to continue rising in the coming days,"As temperatures rise during the spring season in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, the concentration of pollen has begun to rapidly escalate, posing challenges for residents with allergies.
Meteorological experts warn that pollen levels are expected to continue rising in the coming days, with the peak concentration anticipated during the last week of March 2024.
During the existing weather conditions over the next two weeks, the intensity of pollen concentration is projected to spike significantly. Individuals suffering from pollen allergies are strongly advised to take precautionary measures to mitigate symptoms and minimise exposure.
Residents in Islamabad are expressing growing concerns as the pollen season sets in, reporting allergic reactions such as coughing, flu, irritated throats, and mild headaches.
The most prevalent pollen types in Islamabad include Paper Mulberry, Acacia, Eucalyptus, Pines, Grasses, Cannabis, Dandelion, and Alternaria. Among these species, Paper Mulberry accounts for approximately 97% of the total pollen count.

2,Anti-dengue drive suspended,Health dept fears disease outbreak after recovery of larvae from 41 places,"The Rawalpindi administration has paused the anti-dengue checking and monitoring campaign besides related departmental meetings till the completion of the distribution of the Ramazan ration package across the district.
The campaign was halted when medical experts declared next week ideal for the spread of dengue larvae after the recent rains. After the rains, the dry season will begin in Rawalpindi from coming Sunday. Change in weather is likely to increase the spread of dengue larvae, its birth and breeding.
At present, all dengue patrol field workers have been engaged in Ramazan ration distribution duties. The suspension of the campaign has also affected the smooth recruitment process, earlier ordered by the Deputy Commissioner, of 1500 dengue workers and 450 entomologist experts.
The distribution of ration was supposed to be completed before the start of Ramazan, but the process could not be completed owing to the laziness of the administration, confusion in the lists of beneficiaries and no clear plan and policy.
According to district administration sources, this distribution is likely to continue till the 22nd of Ramazan due to which the anti-dengue campaign in Rawalpindi will resume after Eidul Fitr.
After four dengue patients were reported in Rawalpindi before the start of the holy month, the health department and the district administration launched the anti-dengue campaign on an urgent basis and issued orders to make new recruitments immediately. Now due to the Ramazan ration programme, the dengue campaign is constantly stalled, risking the dengue outbreak in Rawalpindi this year.
As spring has started, all small and large 55 cemeteries across the city have been filled with wild weeds and marijuana and in many cemeteries, the weeds have grown more than two feet tall. Due to the lack of spraying and harvesting, dengue larvae have started to breed.
The officials concerned have confirmed the presence and growth of dengue larvae in the standing rainwater in cemeteries, vacant plots and parks. Due to the continuous delay in the dengue campaign, the number of dengue patients is also increasing.
On the other hand, the health department has yet to allocate special dengue wards and medical staff in any government hospital in the city. According to the Department, dengue larvae have been recovered from 41 different places during dengue checking at the beginning of March. As the dengue campaign was stopped around 15 days ago, there is a possibility of an alarming increase in the birth and breeding of dengue larvae.
The dengue larvae’s birth and breeding usually begin on February 15 and the recent rains have sounded the alarm of a record increase in dengue larva birth and breeding. After the inclusion of dengue workers in the ration distribution, the anti-dengue meetings were not held in the Deputy Commissioner's office after Feb 29.

3,Plaza to replace Rawalpindi’s historic cinema,Sources say at least 21 cinemas have shuttered their doors so far in the garrison city,"In the past, movie lovers would stand in long queues to get tickets, but today, the cinema-going culture has completely died. The demolition of the historic Capital Cinema building on Sadar Bank Road that began on Wednesday marks a poignant symbol of decline.
According to the sources, a plaza will be built at the Capital Cinema building. The decline of cinemas in Rawalpindi has reached a concerning level as almost 21 cinemas have been shut down while plazas have been erected at eight cinemas, further highlighting the shift away from traditional entertainment venues.
Formerly iconic venues such as Sangeet, Golistan, Naz Cinema, Nadir Cinema, Novelty Cinema, Rex Cinema, and Galaxy Cinema have all met a similar fate, with commercial structures now occupying their spaces. Others like PAF Cinema, Shabistan Cinema, Odean Cinema Plaza, Roz Cinema, and Khursheed Cinema have also been demolished or closed. Currently, only a few cinemas are operational in Rawalpindi.
Earlier, tickets were sold in the black market as people were very interested in watching Pakistani movies. If missed the very first screening, people would wait for weeks to watch the movie. Vendors used to set up stalls at the cinemas, selling snacks and beverages.
At present, the situation is different. Cinemas established in Jinnah Park and a well-known private housing society called CinePex regularly show Indian or English movies. However, the tickets are so expensive and unaffordable for the citizens.
Aurangzeb Khan, who worked as a manager at Odeon and other cinemas, said that the demise of cinemas is mainly due to the low-quality Pakistani movies. Many famous film actors and actresses in the past including Sultan Rahi, Mustafa Qureshi, Waheed Murad, Nadeem, Ghulam Mohiuddin, Anjuman, Asia, Mumtaz, Reema, Meera, Shaan, Muammar Rana, Shafqat Cheema, Afzal, Lala Sudheer and other famous artists’ performances encouraged people to watch Pakistani movies.
Khan added that when a Pakistani film was about to release or was a hit, the cast of the movie would reach cinemas to promote the film. Cinemas used to be a major source of entertainment as well as employment in those days but now not only the bad standard of Pakistani movies but also the digital world has ruined the cinema culture.

5,Experts discuss role of Urdu language in Pakistan Movement,NLPD organises seminar in connection with Pakistan National Day celebrations,"The National Language Promotion Department (NLPD) on Friday organised a seminar on ""The role of Urdu Language in Pakistan Movement"" in connection with Pakistan National Day celebrations to be held today.
Higher Education Commission (HEC) Chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmed, while Dr Riaz Ahmed, former Director National Institute of Historical Cultural Research, Quaid e Azam University, Islamabad was the keynote speaker on the occasion.
The speakers at the seminar highlighted the importance and role of the Urdu Language and said that it wouldn't be unjustified to say that the Urdu language and the two-nation theory were inevitably indispensable to each other. Regarding that, before the establishment of Pakistan, the Muslims of the subcontinent participated with great vigour with a conviction for Urdu language as their national language despite having others and thus made it possible to accomplish the achievement of Pakistan, they added.
The speakers further said that the Urdu language not only emerged as a symbol of Muslim unity during the Pakistan Movement but it was also established that it had all the traits to be a powerful factor in affirming the need for a separate state for Muslims in Indo-Pak subcontinent where they could be free to lead their lives according to their religion and culture.
NLPD Director General Dr Saleem Mazhar said that Urdu is a major language in the world. Today, the need of the hour is that Pakistan should utilise its resources to develop and nourish the national language, he added.

6,Proposal of uniformed tax on cigarettes hailed,Experts say cigarettes are the cheapest in Pakistan as compared to other regional countries,"Experts have welcomed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) report recommending Pakistan impose uniform excise rates on both local and foreign cigarette manufacturers.
The experts at an Islamabad-based think tank, Capital Calling, also applauded former health minister Dr Nadeem Jan calling for a 50 per cent increase in taxes on cigarettes to make them harder to access for the masses. They also endorsed the minister’s statement rubbishing the propaganda that a rise in taxes will lead to the smuggling of cigarettes, resulting in a loss to the national exchequer.
According to estimates, cigarette prices are the cheapest in Pakistan compared to other regional countries, it said.
The reports on IMF recommendations mention that it has suggested applying a consistent excise rate in one slab to all domestically produced cigarettes, regardless of the manufacturer’s origin. It means local and multinational manufacturers will face no discrimination in taxes. Currently, cigarettes are taxed in two tiers, which is resulting a low collection of taxation from the cigarette industry.
Furthermore, the IMF has also proposed subjecting e-cigarettes to taxation similar to traditional tobacco products, citing comparable health impacts. This recommendation is strictly in line with the guidelines set by the World Health Organisation (WHO), said Dr Hassan Shehzad, from International Islamic University.
He said due to the two-tier system, multinational companies manage to place their cigarettes in the lower tier which results in a reduction in cigarette prices. The objective of these recommendations is to ensure equitable taxation across cigarette products, regardless of their source.
According to the experts at the think tank, it is estimated that the government has faced Rs567 billion loss due to the influence of international tobacco companies. It said there is a dearth of research to measure the damage that smoking has done to society. The survey conducted to assess this damage was highly tilted towards economics, hence offering no solutions as to how to bring down smoking in society.
Similarly, there is no concrete media strategy to counter smoking and its psychological impacts, they said, adding that the majority of smokers are in their 30s and there is a need to think about this age group formulating policies.
The institutions formed to counter smoking suffer from a lack of coordination and vision; hence, fast losing their relevance. Capital Calling has demanded a reset of the mechanism to counter tobacco and full implementation of IMF recommendations for uniform tax on tobacco products, thinking of it as the right step to take.

7,Health authority seeks mobile clinic vehicles,Sets sights on expanding Clinic-on-Wheels programme to the district level,"The Rawalpindi District Health Authority (DHA) has sought 10 vehicles from the Punjab government, setting its sights on expanding the Clinic-on-Wheels programme across the district.
Initially launched with eight vehicles catering to selected union councils, the programme has garnered acclaim for its mission of bringing free medical services right to people’s doorsteps under the slogan “Sahat Aapki Dehleez Par” (Health at your doorstep). Now, in a bid to extend this vital service across the entire district, DHA has appealed for ten additional vehicles from the Punjab government.
According to official sources, the decision to broaden the Clinic-on-Wheels initiative aligns with the broader aim of the government to enhance healthcare accessibility. This expansion will not only involve deploying more vehicles but also recruiting additional medical professionals, and support staff, and equipping these mobile clinics with laboratory facilities.
The ultimate goal is to ensure that individuals from low-income backgrounds can easily access essential medical care without the barriers of distance or affordability.
Each Clinic-on-Wheels unit comprises a dedicated team of healthcare experts, including medical officers, medical specialists, family planning specialists, and support staff. These units offer a range of services, from dispensing medications to conducting tests for glucose and blood pressure levels.
Moreover, they play a crucial role in educating the public about family planning and the significance of proactive health management.
District Health Authority Chief Executive Dr Ijaz Ahmed highlighted the ongoing efforts to bolster healthcare infrastructure in areas like Murree, where mobile dispensaries have already been integrated into the Clinic-on-Wheels programme.
Plans are underway to upgrade primary health centres and establish a separate District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ) to cater to the growing healthcare needs of the region, particularly considering Murree's status as a popular tourist destination, he said.
“The collaboration between the District Health Authority and local authorities reflects a proactive approach towards enhancing healthcare services, ensuring that communities, including those in remote or underserved areas, have access to quality medical care.”
Dr Ijaz further said the forthcoming expansion of the Clinic-on-Wheels programme is poised to make a significant impact by bridging healthcare gaps and promoting well-being throughout the Rawalpindi district.

8,Walk held to mark World Forest Day,"Speaker says forests preservation must for wildlife, humans","Station Commander Brigadier Zakirullah said that the objective of celebrating World Forest Day is to protect and preserve forests as the availability of natural resources is diminishing due to continuous deforestation.
He expressed these views while addressing the participants of a walk and plantation campaign after planting saplings in connection with the International Day of Forests held under the aegis of the Punjab Forest Department.
Brigadier Zakirullah said that deforestation is destroying wildlife and the habitats of beautiful birds. “Deforestation not only prevents the supply of natural resources but also disrupts the human life style”.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN), Pakistan is one of the 10 countries in the world that could be affected more by climate change, Zakirullah added.
He emphasised the need to not only stop deforestation but also to initiate plantations on a large scale with the support of the people.
Deputy Commissioner Agha Zaheer Abbas Shirazi said that it is a good move to associate the plantation drive with women under the Green Punjab.
District Forest Officer Raza Anwar Sheikh informed the participants that 4,000 saplings are being planted on the occasion of the International Day of Forests, saying this year their target is to plant 234,000 saplings in the entire Murree,
At the end of the walk, Station Commander Brigadier Zakirullah, DC Agha Zaheer Abbas Shirazi, Regional Tourism Manager Moazzam Nazir Raja Iftikhar, PDMA District Emergency Officer, Kamran Rasheed, and DPO Raza Anwar Shaikh and officials and members of the Press Club planted saplings.
