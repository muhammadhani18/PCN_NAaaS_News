7,PTI changes its Punjab CM nominee,Party replaces Mian Aslam Iqbal with Rana Aftab,"The PTI has named Rana Aftab Ahmed Khan as its new candidate for the post of the Punjab chief minister following the provincial police’s attempt to arrest its earlier nominee, Mian Aslam Iqbal.

PTI secretary general Hammad Azhar on Saturday wrote on social media platform X that Mian Aslam was nominated by the party’s founding chairman, Imran Khan, for the post of the Punjab chief minister but as the “entire” police of the province had surrounded the provincial assembly to arrest him, the leadership had changed its plan.

He was referring to Mian Aslam’s decision to attend the inaugural session of the Punjab Assembly on Saturday.
He added that the PTI leadership, in consultation with Mian Aslam, had named Rana Aftab as its new nominee for the coveted slot.

On Wednesday, the Peshawar High Court granted protective bail to Mian Aslam in in 18 cases till March 4 registered against him in connection with last year’s May 9 riots in Punjab and Islamabad.

However, on the same day, Mian Aslam managed to avert being arrested in Peshawar by reportedly disguising himself in lawyers’ attire..

The Punjab police had tried to round up Mian Aslam, but he successfully eluded them and sought refuge at the K-P Speaker’s House.

A day later in a post on X, Mian Aslam wrote that the Constitution and law were being shredded into pieces by the Punjab police and bureaucracy. “Despite being granted bail by the Peshawar High Court, the Punjab police attempted to abduct me in Peshawar,” he added.

A day earlier, the PHC took exception to the attempt of the Punjab police to arrest Mian Aslam in Peshawar despite the issuance of protective bail to him by the court and directed the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa police chief to ensure that if those officials made a similar bid in the future, they should be subjected to legal action.

Giving details about the new Punjab CM nominee, Azhar explained that Rana Aftab was elected to the Punjab Assembly five times and the youngest person in the provincial legislature.

The PTI acting Punjab president claimed that according to Form 45, the party enjoyed the support of 212 MPAs against the PML-N, which only had the backing of 40 “true members”.

Describing the PML-N as a “democracy raider”, Azhar insisted that the rest of its members in the provincial assembly were the products of the “rejected February 9 forgeries”.

In response, PML-N central spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb maintained that the Sunni Ittehad Council had taken its first “U-turn” by changing the nominee for the Punjab chief minister post.

Speaking to the media outside the Punjab Assembly, she said that the PML-N’s nominated Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz would announce the road map for the development of the province and effective measures for the uplift of women on Sunday (today).
Aurangzeb added that the Almighty had granted once again granted the post of the premier and chief minister to the PML-N.Home vertical sub 4 and pak

8,"Gohar, Ayub not joining SIC for PTI’s internal polls",Three other party-backed independent NA members from K-P also unable to merge with council,"Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Omar Ayub, and Ali Amin Gandapur are not among the five successful candidates nominated by the PTI for the National Assembly seats from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to join the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) for the reserved seats – the first two because of their participation in the party’s internal polls.

A total of 37 PTI-backed independent candidates for the NA seats emerged victorious from K-P and decided to join the SIC for acquiring their quota of reserved seats.

However, only 31 of them merged with the SIC.

Gohar and Ayub are not joining the SIC because of the upcoming PTI’s intra-party elections.

As for Gandapur, he has given up his place in the NA and stuck to his provincial legislature seat after being nominated for the post of the K-P chief minister by PTI founder Imran Khan.

Two more successful PTI-backed MNAs, Iqbal Afridi and Shahid Khattak, were unable to submit their joining form to the SIC in time because of the delay in issuance of their gazette notifications of their victory.

On Wednesday, the SIC approached the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), seeking the allocation of reserved seats in the National Assembly and provincial legislatures after the PTI sealed its alliance with the council.

The ECP was requested to allot the seats on the basis of the inclusion of the PTI-backed candidates in the party.
A request drafted by SIC Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza was submitted to the polls supervisory body through a PTI representative.

However, the ECP has yet to decide about whether to entertain the request or not.

If the request is accepted, the PTI-allied bloc will be allocated 22 reserved seats for women in the NA, 20 in K-P, and 27 in Punjab, besides three for minorities.

However, the SIC had neither applied for any reserved seat to the ECP – a requirement under the law – nor had it filed a priority list of candidates before the elections.

9,PBC urges CJP to summon JCP meeting,Seeks review of amendments in rules for improvement of judges’ appointment procedure,"A Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) representative in the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) has urged Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa to summon the meeting of the commission regarding the amendments in the commission's rules for the improvement of judges’ appointment procedure.

During the JCP meeting held on Feb 23 to consider the nomination of Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan for his elevation to the Supreme Court, Akhtar Hussain has urged CJP Isa to summon the commission meeting to consider the proposals given by the rule-making committee constituted to review the JCP Rules 2010.

It is learnt that CJP Isa has assured him that the meeting would be called soon for this purpose.

One member of the JCP expects that the JCP full-house meeting will be held before the retirement of Justice Sardar Tariq Masood next month.

Lawyers are wondering as why the JCP meeting is not being summoned to consider the committee's proposals to improve the procedure of judges’ appointment.

The rule-making committee constituted to review the JCP Rules 2010 held its last meeting on Dec 29, 2023, under the co-chairmanship of Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice (retd) Manzoor Ahmed Malik to finalise the draft rules of procedure for the commission in making appointments of the judges of the constitutional courts of the country, that comply with the collegial and inclusive decision-making process enshrined in Article 175-A of the Constitution.

The committee was supposed to send the proposed draft rules before Jan 15.

The draft rules covered the areas for amendments in the process for convening meetings of the commission and making decisions therein, initiation of nomination(s) in the Supreme Court, initiation of nomination(s) in the high courts, adequate representation of the district judiciary and the bar for elevation, criteria for selection for appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and the high courts, confirmation of additional judges in the high courts; and establishment of a secretariat of the commission, appointment of the secretary and other staff thereto.

The committee received suggestions and recommendations sent by women judges and lawyers as well.

It is learnt that the rules committee has suggested to abolish discretionary role of chief justice in the appointment as well as summoning the meeting of the commission.

Now, a committee comprising three members, including chief justice high court, senior puisne judge concerned, and a provincial bar council representative will initiate the names for new appointments in high courts.

Even every member of the JCP can also recommend any name for the new appointment during the meeting.

A performa has also been suggested for the appointment of SC judges.

Likewise, every nominee for the post of a judge will be bound to show his last five years of returns.

The time duration has also been set to fill vacancy of superior courts’ judges.
