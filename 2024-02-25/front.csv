0,The reserved seats’ dilemma,"Whatever the ECP decides, matter of allocation of reserved seats to PTI will land in courts","The unexpected victory of PTI-backed independent candidates in the February 8 general elections has left political parties, the establishment as well as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in a quandary.
The ECP was supposed to issue complete poll results within 14 days after the general elections.
Yet it has not yet been able to decide if it should allot reserved seats to the independent candidates entering the National Assembly under the banner of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC). The polls oversight authority has already allotted reserved seats to all other parties.
According to a notification, the ECP has given the PML-N 19 women’s seats and four minority seats.
The PPPP has got 12 women’s seats and two minority seats and the MQM-P has been allocated four women’s seats and one minority seat. Other parties—the JUI-F, the PML-Q and the IPP—have received one seat each.
The ECP has so far notified allocation of a total of 38 reserved seats for women and seven for minorities. It has held back its decision on the remaining 22 women’s seats and three minorities.
Experts also appear to be divided on the question as to whether the PTI backed candidates should be allocated the reserved seats now that they have joined the SIC.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob said reserved seats should be allotted to the SIC and, if not, then they should be distributed among other parties.
Mehboob said narrow technicalities such as the requirement of submitting a priority list of candidates for reserved seats prior to election should be dispensed with as a whole new parliamentary party has emerged in the assemblies after such a large number of independent members joined SIC.
In all probability, the PILDAT chief said, the matter will eventually be decided by the Supreme Court no matter which way the ECP decides.
“If the ECP decides against allocating reserved seats to the SIC then the seats which otherwise would have gone to the SIC will be distributed among the remaining parties in each house.”
Though, Mehboob said, there is no specific deadline for the ECP to declare allocation of remaining reserved seats, the ECP was supposed to declare all final results within 14 days of the election–which has not happened.
Renowned constitutional expert Hafiz Ehsaan Ahmad Khokhar stated that a significant change in the distribution of reserved seats occurred during the General Musharraf administration.
This is evident in Articles 51,106, and 224 of the 1973 Constitution, as well as in Section 104 of the Election Act, 2017, and Rules 92, 93, and 94 of the Election Rules of 2017, which address the process of allocating reserved seats to women and non-Muslims.
According to the legal expert, within three days of the names of the returned candidates being published in the official gazette, the returning independent candidates, whether in the National Assembly or a provincial assembly, have to lawfully join a party that already has a parliamentary presence in the relevant assembly.
Later, his or her name is added to the total number of general seats won by the political party for the purposes of reserved seats under Article 51 of the Constitution.
The legal expert clarified that the returned candidates are only permitted to join a political party that already has parliamentary representation in the National Assembly or a provincial legislature.
These independent candidates are not permitted, under Article 51 read with Section 104 of the Election Act, to join political parties that do not have any seat in the relevant assembly.
Even if they so choose, there is no legal or constitutional provision that would bind ECP to assign reserved seats to such a political party.
The constitutional expert said the ECP cannot allocate reserved seats to any other party as it is legally bound to give seats as per the strength of the party concerned in the house, which it already has.
He asserted that a political party must adhere to the election schedule set forth by the ECP in accordance with Sections 57 and 58 of the Election Act 2017 in order to win reserved seats, as well as regular seats.
“Therefore, under Section 104 of the Election Act read with Rule 92, 93, and 94 of the Election Rules, no party is allowed to file a new list of priority lists for women and non-Muslim reserved seats,” he said.
Additionally, Ehsaan said, after the time for filing nomination papers has passed, a political party’s list cannot be changed or altered in any way, including in terms of priority or by adding or eliminating individuals.
In light of Article 51 of the Constitution, a political party may, under the Election Act, 2017 add or increase the number of names through a new list in continuation of the previously filed, provided that the list it had previously submitted prior to the election has been depleted as it won more seats than expected in the relevant assembly or because of the participation or inclusion of independents.
As per the constitutional expert, if a political party neglects to submit a list to the ECP by the deadline specified in the election programme and does not have parliamentary representation, then the Election Act, 2017 prohibits submission of a new list at a later time to allocate reserved seats for women and non-Muslims. This is because the Election Act stipulates that the time for submitting the list has expired.
Ehsaan stated that there is a strong presumption that since this is the first time that a significant number of candidates for the National Assembly and provincial assemblies have been returned to office during the general election and have joined a political party which does not have any seat both in the NA as well as provincial assemblies before joining the independent candidates.
“Consequently, this legal disagreement will wind up in constitutional courts, where they will have to make the first determination about how to interpret Articles 51,106, and 224 of the 1973 Constitution, as well as in Section 104 of the Election Act 2017 and Rules 92, 93, and 94 of the Election Rules 2017.”
He said if a political party fails to submit a list or does not have representation in assembly, then no new list for reserved seats can be submitted on the ground that the independent winning candidates have joined them inside assembly.
“In case major independent candidates are legally unable to join such a political party, which in the present situation arise in the country then the remaining reserved seats after the allocation of proportional seats to other political parties would remain vacant,” he said.

1,Govt says IMF conditions for $1.2b tranche met,Power sector debt keeps piling up despite frequent increases in electricity tariff,"Pakistan has met the International Monetary Fund (IMF) benchmarks for maintaining the status quo in the energy sector – in an outcome that may help to get the next loan tranche of $1.2 billion but does not stop the bleeding (debt) despite increase in electricity prices.
The Ministry of Energy officials said that the end-December targets related to containing the flow of circular debt below Rs385 billion, timely increase in the electricity prices under various heads, and slowing the increase in line losses have been met.
The IMF would review the implementation on these targets during the loan negotiations under the second review of the $3 billion bailout package.
The global lender has not yet finalised the dates for the next review talks and is waiting for the formation of the government.
Sources said that as against the condition to restrict the flow of the circular debt to Rs385 billion by end-December, the increase was Rs378 billion. This was slightly better than the IMF requirement, they added.
Still, the total power sector circular debt has ballooned to Rs2.69 trillion by the end of the first half of this fiscal year. Pakistan has committed to the IMF that it would contain the circular debt at June 2023’s level of Rs2.31 trillion by the end of this fiscal year.
Any increase above the Rs2.310 trillion threshold would subsequently be settled against the budget subsidies or through price increase. The authorities hope that they will bring down the debt at the desired level by the close of the fiscal year.
The IMF’s strategy has so far largely remained focused on fiscalization of the power sector losses through budget subsidies and electricity price increase.
The government has allocated Rs952 billion in the budget for subsidies and payment of the past debt. It has constantly been increasing the electricity prices, which has now forced the people to shift towards alternate sources, including solar panels.
The energy ministry officials said that in order to restrict the flow of the circular debt, the government was constantly making tariff adjustments on account of fuel price adjustment and quarterly adjustments.
The power distribution companies have asked for another increase of over Rs7 per unit on account of fuel price adjustment for January, raising alarm bells at various levels, including the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA).
It has recently been communicated to the IMF that the government was actively pursuing cost reduction reforms such as continuing negotiations with the remaining Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and introducing renewable energy in the system to reduce burden on the consumers.
However, there has not been any concrete progress on this front, except expanding the scope of a committee set up for renegotiating the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).
The interim cabinet recently expanded the committee’s scope to negotiate with all the IPPs but it did not begin any such negotiations with the Chinese power plants.
China has repeatedly refused to reopen these power purchase deals.
The last Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government had started negotiations with the IPPs to review the dollar indexation clause.A cap was placed to control the electricity prices rising with further depreciation of the rupee. The caretaker government brought hydel and gas-based IPPs under the scope of the committee.
Instead of improving the power distribution companies’ performance, the focus remained during the past few months on strictly following the regulatory calendar to avoid delays in filing petitions for increase in the prices.
Pakistan had also assured to settle both the guaranteed and unguaranteed debt of the power sector.
The IMF has been intimated that the government released Rs131 billion to the state-owned power plants out of the total requirement of settling their Rs310 billion debt in this fiscal year. The remaining amount will be released in the second half of this fiscal year.
The government has once again assured the IMF that it would convert the expensive Rs82 billion power sector debt into public debt and will issue the sovereign guarantees against the remaining Rs683 billion power sector debt parked in the holding company.
However, there has not been any significant progress on handing over the control of the power distribution companies to the private sector.
The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation approved a plan as late as the first week of February to give two companies, Gujranwala and Hyderabad, to the private sector.
The IMF has also been informed about the progress on the anti-theft campaign. It has been claimed that as of early February, the campaign resulted in savings of Rs76.2 billion and there was also improvement in recovery rates and just for the month of Dec 2023, recovery improved by 5%.
The government has already promulgated an ordinance in December to make electricity theft a cognisable offense.
The government has also commenced an audit of Peshawar and Hyderabad distribution companies. Pakistan would share the audit report with the IMF by next month, the sources said.

2,"PPP clinches Sindh speaker, deputy slots with flying colours","Owais Shah, Anthony Naveed secure 111 votes each; house to elect new CM today","Syed Owais Qadir Shah from the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) seized the position of speaker in the Sindh Assembly, while Anthony Naveed secured the role of deputy speaker with a resounding majority on Sunday.
Shah garnered 111 votes in his favour, surpassing the 36 votes obtained by Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) candidate Sofia Saeed. The voting took place in the presence of 157 members of the provincial assembly.
Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani, presiding over the election, administered the oath to Shah.
Subsequently, Shah, now the newly elected Speaker, presided over the election for the Deputy Speaker. Anthony Naveed, making history as the first Christian community member to assume the role of Deputy Speaker in the Sindh Assembly, also secured 111 votes. His opponent, MQM-P's Rashid Khan, received 36 votes in the election.
Addressing the house after his election, Shah thanked the party leaders for reposing trust in him. He also expressed gratitude to the people of Sindh and the people of his constituency for electing him to represent them in the assembly.
Earlier, nine Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) lawmakers – originally Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed independents – and one Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) lawmaker took oath as members. However, three elected members of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) did not attend the session.
With this, the total number of members, who had been sworn in as MPAs rises to 157. During the speaker and deputy speaker’s election, however, 147 members cast their votes. The nine SIC members and the one JI’s MPA did not participate in the polling process.
Syed Awais Qadir Shah was elected from PS-23, Sukkur constituency in the February 8 general elections. His deputy, Anthony Naveed, came on the reserved seats for minorities on the PPPP’s priority list. He belongs to Karachi, and had previously served as the chairman of a house standing committee.

Read Sindh Assembly members to take oath today
The Sindh Assembly comprises 168 lawmakers – 130 elected on general seats, 29 reserved seats for women, and nine reserved for non-Muslims. The PPPP commands an overwhelming majority of 114 followed by 36 of the MQM-P and 9 of the SIC.
Later, the speaker adjourned the session until Monday (today), when the election of the provincial chief minister would take place.
From the PPPP, Syed Murad Ali Shah filed the nomination papers. The MQM-P has finalised the name of Ali Khurshidi as its candidate for the chief minister's post.
Hailing from the Dadu district Murad Ali Shah, son of former chief minister Abdullah Shah, is seeking the third term as the chief minister. Previously he served as the chief minister from July 29, 2016, to May 28, 2018 and from August 18, 2018, till August 17, 2023.
His likely rival, Khurshidi, won the February 8 general election from Karachi's PS-119 constituency. Previously, he served as a member of the provincial legislature from 2018 to 2023. Given the results of the speaker’s election, Murad Shah is in pole position in Monday’s contest.
Meanwhile, nine independent lawmakers, backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), and one from Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) were sworn in on Sunday in a Sindh Assembly session officiated by Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani. Three newly elected members of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) were absent from the house on the second day.
Speaker Durrani administered the oath of office to the 10 MPAs, which included independents supported by PTI and JI member Muhammad Farooq. With the new swearing-ins, the total number of MPAs has risen to 157.
Three MPAs of GDA and three of the PPP are yet to take their oaths including Nisar Khuhro and Jam Mehtab Dhar, who are also members of the Senate.
Morover, the notification confirming the success of JI's Hafiz Naeemur Rahman, who secured a general seat in the Sindh Assembly, has not been issued. Similarly, the announcement of the successful candidates for two women and one minority reserved seats is still pending.
