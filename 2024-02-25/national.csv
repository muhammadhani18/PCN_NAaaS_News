0,Intuitive Machines shares tumble 30%,Its spacecraft tips over shortly after touching down on lunar surface a day earlier,"Shares of moon lander maker Intuitive Machines, tumbled 30% in extended trade, wiping out a Friday rally after the company said its spacecraft had tipped over shortly after touching down on the lunar surface a day earlier.
The stock of the first private company to successfully land on the moon nearly doubled from $4.98 before the Feb 15 launch to $9.59 as of Friday’s close. Friday’s late-day sell-off left it below $7.

Still, the company said the spacecraft Odysseus is “alive and well” and engineers were sending commands to the vehicle, and NASA officials at a news conference praised the effort.
The first touchdown on the lunar surface by a US spacecraft in more than half a century enthused investors of fellow space startups, sending up shares of companies such as Astra Space, and Satellogic. They slipped between 0.5% and 2.8% in after-hours trading.

1,"Block cheap Chinese auto imports, say US makers",Warn imports can threaten viability of American car companies,"The US government should block the import of low-cost Chinese autos and parts from Mexico, a US manufacturing advocacy group said on Friday, warning they could threaten the viability of American car companies.
“The introduction of cheap Chinese autos – which are so inexpensive because they are backed with the power and funding of the Chinese government – to the American market could end up being an extinction-level event for the US auto sector,” the Alliance for American Manufacturing said in a report.
The group argues the US should work to prevent automobiles and parts manufactured in Mexico by companies headquartered in China from benefiting from a North American free trade agreement. “The commercial backdoor left open to Chinese auto imports should be shut before it causes mass plant closures and job losses in the US,” the report said.
Vehicles and parts produced in Mexico can qualify for preferential treatment under the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement as well as qualifying for a $7,500 electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, the report noted.
The Chinese embassy in Washington said in response that China’s automobile exports “reflect the high-quality development and strong innovation of China’s manufacturing industry... The leapfrog development of China’s auto industry has provided cost-effective products with high quality to the world.”

The issue has received new interest after news reports that China’s BYD plans to set up an EV factory in Mexico. BYD, known for its cheaper models and a more varied lineup, recently overtook its biggest rival, Tesla, to become the world’s top EV maker by sales.
Tesla announced plans almost a year ago to build a factory in the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon. In October, Mexico said a Chinese Tesla supplier and a Chinese technology company would invest nearly a billion dollars in the state.
A bipartisan group of US lawmakers has urged the Biden administration to hike tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles and investigate ways to prevent Chinese companies from exporting to the US from Mexico.
A group of lawmakers urged US Trade Representative Katherine Tai to boost the 27.5% tariff on Chinese vehicles.

2,Ford halts shipments of new Lightning EVs,Plans to ramp up shipments after thorough quality checks,"Ford Motor, said on Friday it had halted shipments of all 2024 model year F-150 Lightning electric pickup trucks, so it could perform quality checks for an issue it did not specify.
The No 2 US automaker said the shipment halt began on February 9. It did not say when it expected to resume shipments that had begun in January of the EV truck. A spokesperson declined to say what quality issue was being checked.
Ford also said that this week it began shipping the first newly designed gas-powered 2024 model F-150 pickups to dealers. Ford said it expects “to ramp up shipments in the coming weeks as we complete thorough launch quality checks to ensure these new F-150s meet our high standards.”
Automotive News reported that hundreds, if not thousands, of 2024 model gas-powered F-150 trucks had piled up in storage lots in southeast Michigan since production began in December.
Ford said in September it would start shipping the new F-150 in early 2024 and said Friday it was “on plan.”
Last month, Ford said it would reduce production of its F-150 Lightning, as demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has been lower than expected.

Ford said Friday production of the EV truck was continuing. In January, the automaker said it would cut production at its Michigan Rouge Electric Vehicle Center to one shift starting April 1. In October, Ford temporarily cut one of three shifts at the EV plant.
Ford told suppliers in December it planned to produce about 1,600 F-150 Lightning EV trucks per week starting in January, roughly half of the 3,200 it previously had planned.
Ford sold 24,165 F-150 Lightning trucks last year in the US, up 55% from 2022, out of about 750,000 total F-150 US sales.
Ford in August had said the plant that builds F-150 Lightning could hit a 150,000-vehicle annualised production rate by October. In 2022 it said it would double EV truck production.

3,New govt hopes spur stock market,"KSE-100 index soars 2,943 points, or 4.9% WoW, closes at 62,816","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) surged nearly 3,000 points in the outgoing week in a rally spurred by an agreement among major political parties to form a coalition government, which largely addressed the political instability that had prevailed since elections in early February.
Investors expected the incoming government to take pro-growth measures and approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a new loan programme of at least $6 billion.
Among the positives, Pakistan’s dollar bonds jumped in the international market and the Roshan Digital Account saw further inflows of nearly $150 million from overseas Pakistanis.
On the other hand, Pakistan’s current account balance shifted from surplus to deficit while yields of treasury bills went up, contrary to expectations of a decline in the State Bank’s policy rate in the near future.
At the beginning of the week, the bourse witnessed a notable recovery from the losses incurred last week, driven by investor optimism about a breakthrough in negotiations for installing a coalition government.
Next day, the KSE-100 index failed to protect Monday’s gains as uncertainty prevailed because of the emerging political scenario.
Stocks bounced back on Wednesday with the easing of political concerns following an agreement among major parties on forming the next government.
The following day, the KSE-100 index extended gains and closed near the 62,000-point mark, buoyed by optimism about a power-sharing deal among political parties.
On Friday, the market reflected growing economic stability and investor confidence, which emerged as major influencing factors when political uncertainty died down, leading to a surge of around 900 points.
Overall, the benchmark KSE-100 index rose 2,943 points, or 4.92% week-on-week (WoW), and settled at 62,815.82.
JS Global analyst Muhammad Waqas Ghani, in his review, noted that the KSE-100 index gained 5% following an agreement among political parties to press ahead with the formation of a coalition government led by the PML-N.

Average volumes, however, decreased 3% WoW to 338 million shares per day. Pakistan’s dollar bond prices jumped in the range of 1-6% after the two major political parties reached an agreement on forming the next government, he said.
Meanwhile, the current account returned to the red zone in January 2024 with a deficit of $269 million, which took 7MFY24 deficit to $1.1 billion. The $700 million current account gap was broadly led by a higher trade deficit that went up $600 million month-on-month (MoM).
Moreover, power generation during January 2024 decreased 2% year-on-year (YoY) while generation cost surged 23%. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported a 0.5% WoW decrease in foreign currency reserves, which had remained around $8 billion for the past three months.
In T-bills’ auction, cut-off yields increased in the range of 33 to 126 basis points for papers of different maturities, the JS analyst added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported that the market remained buoyant, taking the index beyond 62,000 points from 59,000 last week.
Investor sentiment got a boost as the winning political parties reached agreement to form a coalition government.
On the economic front, the current account shifted to a deficit of $269 million in January 2024 from a surplus of $404 million in December 2023. Meanwhile, returns on National Saving Schemes decreased in the range of 40 to 160 basis points.
Power generation in the country climbed 7.6% MoM in January 2024 while the Roshan Digital Account saw inflows of $142 million in the same month, settling at $7.3 billion.
Sector-wise, positive contribution to the market came from exploration and production (623 points), banks (513 points), technology and communication (355 points), fertiliser (255 points) and power (254 points).
Foreign buying continued during the week under review, which came in at $2.9 million compared to net buying of $5.2 million last week, AHL added.

4,Business leaders urge deferral of ALR,"Call for phased approach as abrupt enforcement raises concerns over trade, inflation","Business leaders have called for deferring the Axle Load Regime (ALR) and its gradual implementation, cautioning that the immediate enforcement could push up import bills, reduce exports, skyrocket transportation costs, and heighten inflationary pressures in the country.
They said the ALR of the National Highway Safety Ordinance (NHSO) 2000 re-implemented on November 12, 2023 has been taking a heavy toll on trade. The abrupt implementation of this regime has adversely affected the supply and demand of trucks, increased transportation costs and is consequently propelling inflation to exorbitant levels.
Numerous business leaders have shared their views with The Express Tribune, highlighting that the previously-attempted ALR in 2019 had disastrous consequences. This included frequent disruptions in the supply chain in all trades and industries, particularly agri-based commodities, fertilisers, edible oil, cement, coal, steel and general consumer goods.
They pointed out that transporters who will be worst affected will be the small owners of 10-wheelers and 14-wheelers, constituting about 60% of the trucking fleet of Pakistan – mostly family owned. The total trucking fleet in the country is about 350,000 as the number of goods transport vehicles available for moving within the country is already less than the current requirement. It was cautioned that implementing the ALR in its current form is bound to create an overall shortage in local food and consumer goods supply. Without logical amendments made in this regime, the resulting national food security issues will impact the economy. Leaders suggested that both the documents including the national transport policy and NHSO-2000 need to be revised.
The leaders emphasised that if the rules and regulations in the ALR are amended to be harmonised with the current commercial requirements, and an inland waterway transport system is also developed simultaneously, along with improvements in Pakistan Railways’ freight capacity, this could lead to substantial reductions in freight costs. Ultimately, this would facilitate the desired recovery of the national economy.
It was added that the sudden imposition of this regime may hinder efforts of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) as Pakistan’s exports will become even more uncompetitive than they already are. Moreover, this regime will scale up transportation costs, at a time when such costs need to be driven down for economic betterment. They strongly recommended and called for getting this ALR deferred and subsequently implementing it in a properly planned and phased manner.

Read Fertiliser sector seeks delay in axle load regime
Notably, around 350,000 units of various axle trucks are operating in the country with a majority of them being three axle (10 wheelers) and six axle (22 wheelers). Before the implementation of the ALR, a trailer used to carry from 55 tonnes to 80 tonnes of cargo, while a high-wall truck could transport up to 30 tonnes of goods. However, after implementation of the ALR, they are lifting 39 tonnes and 17 tonnes respectively.
Some users had to get a stay order from the court of law for Karachi only as there is no highway within the port city where goods vehicles can carry 55 tonnes and 30 tonnes. However, vehicles travelling to the northern side are required to follow the ALR of 39 tonnes and 17 tonnes respectively.
They criticised the authority for imposing this ALR, citing concerns about highway conditions which are being broken. Business leaders added that users (import and export industry, heavy goods transporters etc) of highways can pay maintenance costs of the highways, but it is not good to import a large number of vehicles, tyres and ample fuel in order to fulfil the demands, while implementing the ALR.
“Once again, the imbroglio of ALR under NHSO-2000 has taken centre stage. It goes without saying that the issue must be resolved and sanity must prevail on the highways. There are concerns of cost, vehicle and sustainability. And, therein lie the burning issues and therein lie resentment and bitterness,” said Muhammad Najib Balagamwala, Chairman of Seatrade Group of Companies.
He noted that the prime distinctiveness at present is that there is a perennial shortage of road efficient trucks, which has resulted in excessive freight cost per trip.
He underscored the inflationary impact of added cost which is burdensome for the end-user. In addition to these, he noted the factor of delays in discharge from the port.

5,Refineries to enjoy 10% tariff protection,Amended policy guarantees 7-year protection for refineries upgrading plants,"The government has notified amendments to the Refinery Policy 2023 that guarantees a 10% tariff protection for seven years to the existing oil refineries eager to upgrade their plants to enhance petrol and diesel production with Euro 5 fuel specifications.
The new policy is expected to draw an investment of up to $6 billion in the expansion of oil refineries. Tariff collection will go into an escrow account while the refineries will be able to withdraw up to 27.5% of funds for plant upgrades.
With the expansion of production facilities, the refineries will double their diesel production capacity, thus lessening reliance on imports.
The refineries qualifying for tariff protection can withdraw up to 24.5% of total project cost from the joint escrow account on the import of used plant, machinery and equipment (PME) for upgrading their plants.
However, the refineries desiring to import new PME will be able to draw a maximum of 27.5% of total project cost from the joint escrow account.
Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL) has already signed an agreement with the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and awarded contracts for capacity expansion from 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 100,000 bpd.
However, other refineries raised observations pertaining to spending from the escrow account and force majeure clauses.
The caretaker government, after negotiating with the refineries, has amended the policy. The amended oil refining policy was notified on February 23, 2024 following its approval by the cabinet on February 15, as recommended by the Cabinet Committee on Energy in its meeting on February 6.
The policy was initially notified on August 17, 2023 but it has now been amended after taking into consideration concerns of the refineries over some of the clauses, which would have left the proposed upgrading projects unviable.
The amendments were made after intense and prolonged consultations among the government, refineries, and independent financial and legal advisory firms.
When contacted, Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) Chairman and Attock Refinery Limited Chief Executive Adil Khattak said the new refinery policy would enable oil refineries to undertake major upgrade projects to not only comply with Euro 5 fuel specifications but also increase production of deficit products, such as petrol and diesel by 99% and 47% respectively.
It will also result in slashing furnace oil output by 78% which, because of drastically reduced demand in recent years, often causes storage constraints, forcing the refineries to reduce capacity utilisation.
The upgrading of refineries will attract investment of $5-6 billion, lead to the production of cleaner, environmentally friendly fuels and major savings in foreign exchange.

Read Refineries warn of shutdown, seek incentives
Khattak emphasised that the modernisation of refineries would surely be termed the most important achievement of the caretaker government and voiced hope that the policy would be implemented in true letter and spirit.
The policymaking process, which took more than four years mainly due to changes in governments and bureaucracy, was initiated by Nadeem Babar in his capacity as special adviser to the then prime minister. Final credit for taking on board all stakeholders after due diligence and independent professional input goes to outgoing Energy Minister Muhammad Ali.
Khattak pointed out that the role of Ogra and the Directorate General Oil had been pivotal in formulating the policy and would also remain critical in successful execution of the policy.
According to the 2023 refinery policy, there will be a minimum customs duty or regulatory duty of 10% on imported motor gasoline (petrol) and diesel for seven years from the date of notification of amendments to the policy.
Any customs duty exceeding 10% and reflected in the ex-refinery price will be channeled into the inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) pool.
The refineries ineligible for incentives must deposit the same in the IFEM pool. Any customs duty on crude oil will be reimbursed to the refineries through IFEM.
Refineries will enjoy a 10% tariff protection, or deemed duty, applicable to ex-refinery prices of motor gasoline and diesel for seven years from the date of signing of the project upgrade agreement and opening the joint escrow account with Ogra within 60 days of the notification of amendments to the policy.
However, the refineries must deposit 2.5% of deemed duty on diesel and 10% on motor gasoline (incremental incentive) in the escrow account held jointly by Ogra and the respective refinery in the National Bank of Pakistan for utilisation on upgrading projects.
Until the opening of the escrow account, the incremental incentive will be deposited in the IFEM pool. The prevailing 7.5% deemed duty on diesel for sustainability will continue after the seven-year incentive period for 20 years or until deregulation, whichever is earlier.
For an existing refinery to qualify for the fiscal incentives outlined in the policy, it must within 60 days, after the notification of amendments, execute a legally binding upgrade agreement with Ogra.
The agreement will specify the output and outcome of the committed upgrade, including the maximum production of Euro 5-compliant motor spirit and high-speed diesel and a reasonable reduction in furnace oil output, as outlined in the Front-end Engineering Design (FEED) of the upgrade project, along with proposed milestones and tentative timelines including a feasibility study, FEED, financial close, engineering, procurement and construction contract and commissioning.

6,‘Fixing current account key to GDP growth’,"LSE report highlights urgent need for structural reforms, less dependency on imports, loans","The newly elected government’s first policy challenge will be to raise GDP growth, which is expected to remain at 2.71% for FY-24. However, the new country’s financial managers have to break the hysteresis that appears to have become embedded in the economy since FY23, and persists into FY24, said a recent research report launched by Lahore School of Economics.
The report highlights that Pakistan’s economy is highly import dependent, especially in large-scale manufacturing. A high growth rate of GDP verging on 6% over FY22 required import levels of $90 billion. Over FY23, these import levels dropped to $67 billion, and over FY24, this import constraint still appears to bite. Prior to the import constraint, in FY22, the level of imports required per month topped $7 billion, the report said.
Over FY23, this import level has dropped to $5.5 billion per month. Over the first quarter (Q1) of FY24, this import level has persisted at $5.5 billion per month. The import constraint has continued from FY23 to FY24 because its causal factors have also continued from the said period. These have been observed to be a persistent deficit in the current account (CA), a rapidly depreciating exchange rate, and weak reserves of foreign exchange, said the report.
All three causal factors make it difficult to pay a high import bill, which is needed for higher GDP growth.
The report added that the crisis for the economy is largely a current account crisis, and the government’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the short-term Service Level Agreement loan of $3 billion can only be palliative at best, as twenty-three agreements with recourse to IMF loans only serve to sharpen this policy lesson.
The report further said that the economy’s main vulnerability is on its current account, and no domestic restructuring of the economy will fix the CA issue. “Only restructuring the current account will fix the current account.” High inflation too appears to have become embedded in the economy over FY23 and as observed in the first quarter (Q1) of FY24. Inflation has raged, approximating 30%.
The three main causal factors for such high inflation, estimated by our model, are rapid depreciation of the exchange rate, a large budgetary deficit, and an increase in energy prices. Government policy, in allowing a depreciation of the exchange rate or running a high budget deficit, does not have the objective of raising consumer prices. It is an inadvertent result. However, GOP’s policy, in raising energy prices, does have the objective of raising consumer prices, the report added.
Further, the report estimates that nearly two-thirds of the increase in the prices of the six main sources of energy are not to recoup an increase in suppliers’ prices but to raise the GOP’s tax. Here GOP policy must be prudent. GOP needs to reduce its budget deficit by raising taxes. But raising ad valorem taxes on energy is very inflationary, as observed; however, raising income taxes will not be inflationary and will also be more progressive and serve the purpose of fixing the current account deficit of the country.

7,SBP eases rules for exporters,Allows utilisation of proceeds kept abroad without central bank’s prior approval,"Pakistan’s central bank has softened rules for exporters by allowing them to “freely” utilise the proceeds kept abroad in their Special Foreign Currency Accounts (ESFCAs) without prior approval, a move aimed at boosting export of goods and services.
In a notification sent to presidents and chief executives of all authorised dealers (mainly commercial banks) in foreign exchange, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said “in order to facilitate the exporters and promote ease of doing business, the utilisation of the retained funds has been further liberalised.”
Now, “all exporters will be able to freely utilise the funds held in ESFCAs for making all types of payments abroad of current account nature, for their own business purposes, without prior SBP approval.”
Furthermore, on the request of exporters, the authorised dealers may issue debit cards against the balances held in ESFCAs, it said.
Earlier, the central bank had allowed general exporters to keep 10-15% of export proceeds in their foreign currency accounts. Moreover, freelancers, information technology and software exporters can retain up to 50% of export proceeds.
The notification elaborated that the exporters could utilise the funds to make import payments, acquire IT and digital services from abroad, repatriate dividends to foreign shareholders, market their products in foreign markets and pay salaries to foreign employees.
Exporters could also use the funds for investment abroad and repaying foreign debt. They could not use the funds in foreign currency denominations in Pakistan, but could convert them into local currency for expenditures in the country, the notification added.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Pakistan Business Council Chief Executive Ehsan Malik welcomed the central bank’s move to liberalise the utilisation of the retained funds, believing such measures should spur growth in export of goods and services.
He pointed out that the central bank had notified the authorised dealers to issue debit cards to exporters on request after it capped expenditures by others at $30,000 a year.
Malik was of the view that most of the expenditures mentioned in the notification had already been allowed to exporters. However, the notification addressed the prevailing confusion among exporters.
The liberalisation of expenditures will help exporters to promote sales of their products in foreign markets, utilise funds for overseas travel and pay salaries to foreign employees.
According to Malik, the exporters can also use the funds to acquire a company abroad, subject to the ceiling on their foreign currency accounts.
He said there were specialised marketing firms in the US and Europe, which knew markets better than others as they had a special marketing network. “Acquisition of such companies helps a lot in marketing and promoting Pakistani products in western countries.”

Read Exporters underline need for innovation, diversity
He expected the measures to help grow exports from Pakistan but much depended on the prevailing business conditions abroad. Many foreign countries are still battling the elevated inflation and have kept interest rates high.
He hoped that inflation and interest rates would come down soon, prompting foreigners to increase spending in their respective countries. This will encourage Pakistan to ramp up exports.
The annexure provided by the central bank along with the notification read that the funds of such exporters available in the ESFCA with an authorised dealer may be transferred to the same exporter’s ESFCA maintained with another authorised dealer, upon specific request of the exporter.
Both the authorised dealers shall ensure that the proceeds being credited are from the ESFCA and pertain to the same exporter.
The funds available in ESFCAs cannot be credited and/or transferred to any other foreign currency account and/or FE-25 account. However, on the request of the exporter, the funds available in ESFCA can be converted into Pakistani rupees any time.
Exporters can utilise the retained funds to make payments for import for the purpose of their own business, subject to compliance with the applicable Import Policy Order and related laws/regulations issued by any government department and the SBP, according to the central bank.
Exporters are allowed to make payments for the acquisition of services, IT or digital services from abroad, without prior designation requirement.
The retained funds can be used to pay dividends of domestic entities to their shareholders abroad, provided the shares owned are registered as “repatriable” with the SBP.
They can make payments for operational expenses, including employee salaries, liaison, marketing, and representative offices abroad of local companies in accordance with the provisions.
The funds in ESFCAs can also be used for making payments with regard to capital and financial account transactions, such as equity investment abroad and foreign currency loan repayments. However, in case of remittance of such transactions, a proper procedure as described in the relevant regulations shall be followed.
The authorised dealers are required to facilitate the exporters (on specific request) by issuing debit cards against the balances held in ESFCAs. “However, no cash withdrawal in foreign currency from ESFCAs shall be allowed within Pakistan.”

8,FBR to bring stone crushing within tax net,Vows to enforce tax and prevent tax evasion from this sector,"Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), Ali Salih Hayat Kalyar, said that stone crusher’s owners who were not paying taxes and not got registering their business would face stern action.
Talking to APP on Saturday, he said that stone crush at unit Pul 111, Sargodha, was supplied to all parts of the country due to the high quality of the indigenous rock. “Unfortunately, this sector has zero contribution in terms of taxes despite massive sales and huge earnings, but some highly influential vested interest persons are involved in this sector who are the major obstacle to implementation of proper taxation,” he said.

The FBR official stated that according to safe estimates, the quantum of taxation from this sector is approximately Rs.5 billion annually. In the past, efforts were made by the tax authorities to enforce tax and prevent tax evasion from this sector.
“Recently, under the directions of Dr Faheem Mohammad, Chief Commissioner, Regional Tax Office, Sargodha, a concerted plan of action was devised to bring this sector into the tax net in the best interests of the country,” Kalyar maintained.
He said that a team was selected to monitor the production of the sector round the clock.
