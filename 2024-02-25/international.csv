Sindh, in particular, grapples with a significant challenge, with more than 7.6 million children not attending any educational institution.
The aforementioned alarming figures emerged during the Sindh provincial consultation on free and compulsory education, a collaborative effort between the National Commission on the Rights of Child (NCRC) and the School Education and Literacy Department, Sindh government, convened at the reforms support unit on Friday.
The meeting chaired by NCRC Chairperson Ayesha Raza Farooq, drew representatives from the government's education department, civil society organizations, international bodies such as UNICEF and the International Rescue Committee (IRC), and private schools representatives.
Speaking on the occasion, Farooq stressed that education is not merely a right but a fundamental pillar for the nation's progress. Despite the efforts by the government to raise awareness about rights and violations, Pakistan struggles with the highest number of out-of-school children. 
With over 40 per cent of the population comprising children aged below 18 years, she underscored the urgency of addressing this issue to curb child labour and promote educational advancement.
""We are at the crossroads where the future of our children is at the stake,"" said Chairperson Farooq.
