0,ANP’s Charsadda rally slams ‘poll rigging’,Announces protest outside the provincial assembly during its inaugural session,"Awami National Party (ANP) on Friday once again rejected the election results and demanded a judicial inquiry into the alleged poll rigging.
ANP held a large protest rally against the ‘polls management’ in Charsadda which was attended by thousands of party workers. The party also announced a protest demo outside the provincial assembly on the occasion of its inaugural session. 
Addressing the rally ANP’s Central General Secretary, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said that some elements wanted to get the desired results in Punjab and when they failed, they made Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) the scapegoat.
“In pursuit of desired outcomes in K-P, ANP was marginalized,” he stated, highlighting unprecedented levels of election rigging. “Our ideology, rooted in non-violence, remains incompatible with such forces,” he continued, emphasizing his party’s commitment to parliamentary supremacy and the rule of law.
Protests against electoral rigging are underway across all four provinces today, as a selected group has been imposed on the country under the guise of general elections,” he remarked.
“Let me make it clear: nobody trusts the Election Commission of Pakistan anymore because of these failed elections,” he asserted, noting that ANP was among the parties that had lost faith in the ECP. 
Addressing the rally, ANP Provincial President Aimal Wali Khan urged the Chief Justice to intervene and establish a judicial commission to investigate these irregularities and allegations of rigging. 
“We will take legal action alongside those who were coerced into paying for desired outcomes,” he declared, denouncing the notion that the establishment could dictate the nation’s future. 
“According to the constitution, they are our guardians, not rulers, and they must cease meddling in politics and democracy, focusing instead on protecting the country’s borders,” he remarked.
“We are grateful that we stand apart from the establishment, and those who sought to keep us out of parliament inadvertently propelled us back to our original roots,” he remarked. “For the past century, ANP’s political approach has evolved, yet its fundamental questions remain unchanged,” he noted.
“History bears witness to the denial of ANP’s rights since its inception, despite Bacha Khan’s efforts that compelled the British government to grant Pakhtuns the right to vote,” he added. “Within a week of Pakistan’s creation, the tragic Babra massacre in Charsadda claimed the lives of 600 innocent and unarmed Pakhtuns,” he lamented.
When the first true general elections were held in Pakistan, East Pakistan broke off because of the stolen mandate, he maintained, adding that in order to ensure the supremacy of a big province, a bloodbath took place in Bengal.

Council Ayaz apprised the court that the PHC had issued Pakistani origin cards to several Afghan nationals in recent days and the petitioner was also a Pakistani national who got married to an Afghan national so her husband had the right to get Pakistani nationality.

2,Gandapur terms ‘K-P uplift’ PTI’s priority,CM-designate says there will be no revenge politics,"Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) chief minister-designate Ali Amin Gandapur has vowed that the PTI government will restart the process of development in the province.
He said that the Sehat Insaf Card would be reinstated for the welfare of the general public and the law and order situation was also the first priority of his government.
Talking to former provincial minister Shaukat Yousafzai and newly elected members of the provincial assembly Fazal Hakeem Khan, Idrees Khatta and Muhammad Naeem on Saturday, he said that the closing of panahgahs (shelter homes) for the poor people by the previous government was not a good decision and that it would be reversed.
“Bringing the far-flung districts of the province at par with the rest of the province in development is my top priority,” he said, adding that the backward districts would be quickly developed to address their deprivations.
“Let me tell you we will establish a lasting peace at any cost as law and order is also our first priority,” he maintained, adding that the province would be made attractive for foreign investors.
There were many difficulties as there was a government at the Center which was against the PTI but still they would try their level best to get the rights of the province from the federation, he shared, adding that without getting all the rights of the province it was very difficult to put the province on the path of development.
“We will negotiate the matter of the provincial rights with the federal government and solve this problem,” he said. “Ending the free medical treatment on Sehat Insaf Card by the caretaker government was really painful for me as it concerned mostly the poor people,” he said, adding that panagahs for the poor were also closed down without any logic by the caretakers.
He made it clear that all those schemes would be restored by the new PTI government in the province, adding that there would be no revenge politics in K-P by his government.
“There will be no repeat of what happened in the province during the caretaker government’s period. There will be no revenge,” he argued.
“Our focus will be on the development of the province and there will be no space for revenge,” he noted, saying that he would also advise his party workers and friends to forget about the past.
“The PTI government will not tolerate any obstacle in the way of development in this province. We will work day and night for the development and uplift of this province and my team will also follow me,” he observed, adding that the first priority would always be solving the problems faced by the general public.
Earlier, Gandapur had warned police officers and returning officers repeatedly for their involvement in poll rigging as well as raiding the houses of PTI workers and harassing the women and children during these raids. 
He said that strict action would be taken against those ROs who were involved in ‘poll management’.

3,Interim CM claims holding ‘peaceful elections’,"Domki lauds role of officers, saying they will be remembered","Caretaker Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Ali Mardan Khan Domki has said that the interim set-up worked with diligence to ensure good governance and fulfilled its responsibilities assigned for the execution of daily official affairs along with the mandate of conducting transparent and impartial elections in the province.
The CM, while addressing a dinner hosted in honour of the secretaries of all departments and the Balochistan IG police on Friday night, said that the restoration of peace was a big challenge for the caretaker government as the problems and conditions of the province were completely different, which could not be compared to those of other provinces of the country in any way.
Domki said, “The provincial government has successfully implemented its strategic initiatives for the provision of health, education, and other basic facilities to the population spread over a wide area to ensure the socio-economic development of its people despite the lack of basic infrastructure in remote areas.”
The caretaker provincial government, with the support of senior and hardworking officers, played a key role in reducing the problems of the people by completing the pending projects, he said, adding that in all the extraordinary circumstances of Balochistan, the caretaker provincial government ensured the holding of peaceful elections as well as the rights of Balochistan being defended at every forum.
“The caretaker government has completed the pending projects of public nature, including the Quetta development package, rehabilitation projects in flood-affected districts, and means of communication to provide relief to the masses,” he added.

4,Governor calls for resolving labour rooms issue,"Says child, mother mortality rate highest in Balochistan due to scattered population","Balochistan Governor Malik Abdul Wali Khan Kakar has expressed concern at the non-functional labour rooms in most of the district headquarter hospitals of the province, calling for immediate steps to resolve the issue.
He expressed these views while addressing the participants of the 15th Pakistan Pediatric Conference 2024. Caretaker Health Minister Dr Amir Muhammad Jogaizai, Pediatric Neurology President Dr Shahnaz Ibrahim, Organising Committee Chairman Dr Habibullah Babar, Dr Jamal Raza, Dr Attaullah Bizenjo and Dr Tipu Sultan besides others were present. 
Addressing the conference, the governor said that if the medicines provided by the government did not reach the patients, no meaningful change would come after spending billions of rupees from the federal and provincial budgets in various sectors. 
“If doctors and teachers do not attend health and educational institutions, who is responsible for it,” he questioned. “To change these unfavourable conditions, we have to speak the truth, as time demands that we all sit together to find a lasting solution.”
He said that today’s prestigious conference and holding a conference on a sensitive but very important topic regarding children’s health, especially neurology was a commendable act, the purpose of which was to define a healthy society.
“It is a fact that the bright future of a country or nation is conditioned by mentally and physically healthy people,” he said, inviting experts from different fields of life, especially neurologists, to help in devising a comprehensive strategy at the national level.
He said, “We are sure that such conscious efforts will yield positive results.” 
The governor said that Balochistan, which was relatively a backward province, had the highest maternal and child mortality rate even today as due to the small but dispersed population of the province, it was a big challenge to bring basic health facilities to the doorsteps of the people.
He said that it was also a sad aspect of society that children were seen in various shops, hotels, garages and rubbish heaps. 
“In a house where there is severe poverty and the parents are also not educated, in such a situation, parents cannot do anything for the education and treatment of their children,” he said.
He said that even in this advanced age of science and technology, thousands of people in Balochistan died every year from curable diseases like malaria, jaundice, polio and TB.
“I am proud that today I am present among dedicated doctors who are working day and night to solve physical ailments as well as mental health problems,” he noted.
