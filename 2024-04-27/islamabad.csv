He said he had been receiving calls from Sajid’s mobile phone for the last four days and the caller has also been allowing his son to talk to him.
He said in the complaint that the kidnappers also contacted his younger son Mohammad Abid who is in Saudi Arabia and demanded Rs50,000 from him.

4,Capital’s ‘horror zoo’ is reborn as rehab centre,"ISLAMABAD: Before it was forced to close over its “intolerable” treatment of animals, the Islamabad Zoo was home...","ISLAMABAD: Before it was forced to close over its “intolerable” treatment of animals, the Islamabad Zoo was home to neglected elephants and underfed lions pacing back and forth behind the bars of their enclosures.
Now, four years later, it is a rehabilitation centre for wildlife, providing a refuge for motherless leopard cubs, tigers seized from owners who kept them as status symbols and bears forced to dance or fight for the amusement of crowds.
“The whole energy of the place has changed ever since the zoo was emptied... The care shows; look around,” Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) Head Rina Saeed told AFP.
The zoo gained international notoriety in 2016 when the singer Cher launched a campaign to remove its shackled Asian elephant, Kaavan, the last in the country and dubbed the world’s loneliest elephant.
But Kaavan’s treatment wasn’t an isolated incident; two lions died at the facility when zookeepers attempted to force them from their pen by setting fire to piles of hay, and over the years, hundreds of animals listed on the zoo’s inventory simply vanished.
Pakistan’s climate change ministry said it was “seriously concerned” about the “intolerable and inhumane” treatment of animals at the zoo in 2020, the same year the courts ordered it shut down and Kaavan was moved to Cambodia.
Within months of its closure, a small rescue centre began to take root at the facility, and now evidence of its past as a tourist attraction is fading, as silence hangs over the empty, overgrown parking lot and the shabby ticket stand sits idle next to a swing set.
“Now it is a proper rehabilitation centre with over 50 animals,” Saeed said, adding that the team had rescued more than 380 animals.
Amir Khalil, a veterinarian who directs the global animal welfare organisation Four Paws, which oversaw Kaavan’s relocation, recently made an emotional return to the zoo, saying it “now holds hope.”
Vets from the Austria-based NGO had come to the centre to see three black bears whose claws had been removed by their previous owners, treating them in the shadow of an abandoned Ferris wheel in the zoo’s former cafe, now a makeshift clinic.
“This place is unrecognisable,” Khalil told AFP while inspecting one of the animals, an overweight former dancing bear called Anila, who was also suffering from a nose infection from a ring pierced through her snout to help keep her under control.
Last year, the IWMB seized a tiger cub with broken bones from a vet clinic in an upscale neighborhood in the capital, later relocating the animal to South Africa.
“We think animals are toys,” IWMB Research and Planning Deputy Director Ali Sakhawat said.
“No matter how many zoos we make for kids, this won’t teach them that animals are to be taken care of,” said IWMB’s Sakhawat, adding, “Wild animals are to be kept in the wild, not cages.” 
The animals brought to the centre are not only physically injured but also mentally traumatised.
“We keep them occupied to help them erase the memories of the trauma inflicted by poachers,” Aneis Hussan, a wildlife ranger, told AFP as he played with Daboo, one of the rescued black bears.
“The bears you’ve observed here exhibit signs of joy, roaming freely and climbing trees - a stark contrast to the captivity that deprived them of happiness,” Hussan added.
A new Islamabad Nature and Wildlife Management Act would strengthen animal protections, but Saeed says it still “needs the president’s signature.” The last presidential order on animal welfare, restricting bear baiting, was passed over 20 years ago by President Pervez Musharraf.
“No one in the government listens; I have gotten old trying to make them understand how important this is,” Safwan Ahmad, vice chairman of the non-profit Pakistan Wildlife Foundation, told AFP.
IWMB wants to establish a permanent sanctuary at the site of the rehabilitation centre, but the local authority that owns the land intends to reopen the facility as a public zoo.
“There is one zoo in almost every city worldwide,” said Irfan Khan Niazi of the environmental department of the Capital Development Authority (CDA), adding, “Just because rules were not followed once does not mean it would happen again.”

The traders made their grievances known through a press conference held at a local hotel on Friday.
The press conference was addressed by Chamber of Commerce and Small Industries Senior Vice President Naeem Ashraf, Traders’ Union Chairman Raja Habibur Rehman, Faisal Abbasi and Sohail Ahmed.
They issued a white paper against Cantonment Board Wah authorities in which they alleged that some officials of the building control department had themselves allowed conversion of residential properties into commercial and were now sealing them through different tactics.
They claimed that the board’s commercialisation fee was the highest in the country, which was why they were unable to pay it. As a result, their properties were being sealed, they added.
Raja Habib said there were over 40 cantonments in the country but properties were being sealed only in Wah. He alleged that the civic body was utilising colonial law to create unrest among the traders who were the backbone of the economy. He said shops of traders who were paying taxes were being sealed.
Speaking in the occasion, a trader, Naeem Ashraf, said: “These are not 118 commercial units but 118 families from whom the civic body officials were snatching bread and butter.”
He said they were being treated as criminals by the civic body officials.
He went on to say that the bureaucracy was creating unnecessary obstacles in the conversion of domestic property into commercial as files were relevant files were lying with the civic body from the last many years.
In response to the traders’ allegation, Additional Cantonment Executive Officer (ACEO) Ghulam Sabir Basra termed the traders’ union an illegitimate body.
Flanked by cantonment board secretary Kamran Sahi, Mr Basra told mediapersons that the so-called representatives of the traders’ community were not registered with the relevant labour and traders’ bodies concerned.
Mr Sabir said 423 residential premises were identified which were illegally being used for commercial purposes and were evading taxes.
He further said 118 units had been sealed while action was being taken against the rest of the properties.
He informed the media that residential properties were being used as schools, colleges, academies and shops.
Markets, hospitals and beauty parlours had also been established, Mr Sabir said, adding that the traders’ unions were encouraging people to break the law instead of fulfilling their responsibilities.

PHA has chalked out a schedule for the floral displays, food stalls, and festival swings. Besides, fireworks would be held on inauguration day, PHA Director General Ahmed Hassan Ranjha said.
He added that the festival would be held in two phases: a flower show, a musical night, and fireworks in Allama Iqbal Park, while in the second phase, a two-day function will be held at Gorakhpur near Adiala, where tent pegging and horse dancing competitions will be held from May 11 and May 12.
Mr Ranjha said that tent pegging and horse dancing would be held in Gorakhpur as it required a large area and we had a lot of space outside the city areas. Moreover, flower fest would be displayed where the gardeners of PHA would arrange the spring flowers in different shapes.
The PHA director general noted that the food stalls will also be installed at the festival, adding that the festival will sensitise the community regarding tree plantations, environmental changes, global warming, ozone depletion, and pollution through different programmes.
Earlier, the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) had planned to start the festival on April 26, but it was canceled due to the Met Office prediction of rains from April 26 to April 29.

Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan also recused himself from hearing the petition of senior lawyer Mohammad Waqas Malik who filed a reference against Senior Puisne Judge Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani.
Mr Malik, a former secretary of Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA), appeared before Justice Khan in a case related to housing societies.
His client, Uzma Shahid, was aggrieved of a restraining order issued by the court some two years ago that barred the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) from probing the illegalities in the affairs of societies.
When he appeared before the court, Judge Khan inquired from him about the filing of a reference against the senior puisne judge.
In the reference, Mr Malik alleged that Justice Kayani “waged a war against the forces of Pakistan in a planned manner by inducing and convincing other judges of the high court.”
It said the letter to the Supreme Judicial Council by the judges of the IHC was not written “in good faith as he is facing references questioning his integrity and conduct as a judge”.
It may be mentioned that six IHC judges, including Justice Khan who was hearing the petition, had signed the said letter, however, the lawyer was seeking the proceeding under Article 209 of the Constitution against Justice Kayani only.
During the hearing on the petition, Justice Khan remarked that the lawyer had also pointed fingers at the judges other than the senior puisne judge, therefore, he could not hear the petition because the proceeding might be prejudiced.
The judge also recused himself from hearing the petition and referred it to the IHC chief justice for entrusting it before any other bench.

9,Capital managers extend contract with RMWC for disposal of waste in Pindi,"Unable to set up landfill site in Islamabad, civic agency has been relying on temporary arrangements","ISLAMABAD: Owing to the negligence of Capital Development Authority (CDA), Islamabad is still without a landfill site and after several makeshift arrangements the civic agency has been temporarily disposing of waste in Losar area of Rawalpindi for around two years and the contract has been extended for six more months.
After every six months, the CDA extends its contract with Rawalpindi Waste Management Company (RWMC). A couple of days ago, the civic agency extended the contract from April 4 to October 3, 2024. Under this agreement, CDA pays to the company Rs1,350 per tonne as the tipping fee.
The CDA collects garbage and trash from the city and before transporting to Losar dumps it at I-11. However, the civic agency is now in the process of setting up a proper transfer station at I-9 inside the compound of the sewage treatment plant. Once started, the work will be completed in six months.
Meanwhile, almost every year the CDA floated the idea of setting up a proper “scientific landfill” site only to change the stance later. At present, the civic agency is planning to set up a site in Losar after acquiring land through the Rawalpindi administration.

Unable to set up landfill site in Islamabad, civic agency has been relying on temporary arrangements

“We are going to procure land in Losar to have a proper landfill site. Our talks are underway with Rawalpindi authorities,” said director sanitation Mashooq Ali Shaikh. He said the CDA board had approved six-month extension in the agreement with RWMC.
Earlier last year, the CDA had proposed two sites at Kuri and Dhoke Jando near Nicholson’s Monument. In 2018, it had also proposed a landfill site in ditches created in hills by stone crushers at Sangjani, but the environment body rejected the site.
The unavailability of a landfill site in capital was also petitioned in Islamabad High Court (IHC) and last year the court had directed the CDA to resolve the issue.
Senior lawyer Raja Inam Ameen Minhas, who filed the case in the IHC, told Dawn on Thursday that it was unfortunate that the capital city had no scientific landfill site. “Unavailability of a landfill site in city of around three million people is great injustice.” He said the handling of garbage and trash by the CDA was highly questionable. 
“We pleaded this case in court where not only CDA but representative of the federal government also assured the court that a proper landfill site will be developed, but nothing happened,” he said, adding garbage was destroying city’s environment while it is also hazardous for health of citizens. 
“In this city, five-star hotels and high-rises buildings can be built but I don’t know why CDA is not paying heed to this issue of public importance,” he said. Moreover, in rural areas of Islamabad, people were throwing garbage at vacant places and nullahs. 
“This was not a big issue when the population of Islamabad was small, but it has become a serious issue with urbanisation and growth of the capital city. Poor handling of waste is a source of contamination of water, soil and environment and spread of various diseases,” he said.
“The CDA was established in 1960, but still today it has failed to have a scientific landfill site like other cities,” the lawyer said.
An official of CDA said every year the civic agency spent over two billion rupees on waste issue and if a proper landfill site is developed, it could earn by using the waste for an energy project. He said that before disposing of solid waste at Losar, the civic agency used to dump garbage in the residential sector of I-12. However, the court in 2022 directed the civic agency to shift it outside the residential area. The court had also directed the CDA to ensure that “no waste is dumped in temporary sites in residential areas with effect from 04-10-2022.” Then the CDA moved towards Losar on a temporary basis.
In the past, on the recommendations of an international consultant, the CDA had selected a site at Kuri. An access road was also constructed to the site but all of a sudden, in 2011, the CDA and the environment body decided to shelve the project. Some officials at that time had alleged that the CDA dropped the idea of setting up a landfill site in Kuri to appease owners of housing schemes. Since then, the civic agency has been shifting the temporary landfill site from one place to another.

10,PPP leader to file contempt of court petition against Capital Development Authority,"CDA destroyed 30 years of hard work of setting up the courts in 30 minutes, says Taj Haider.","ISLAMABAD: PPP leader Taj Haider on Friday said that he would file contempt of court petition against the Capital Development Authority (CDA) for demolishing tennis courts.
Addressing a press conference, PPP veteran leader and former senator said that despite having stay orders, the CDA demolished tennis courts under a conspiracy.
He said that 30 years hard work of setting up the courts was destroyed by CDA in 30 minutes adding that he would continue pleading this case until restoration of the court.
Flanked by PPP leader Sibtul Hasan Bukhari,Qayum Baig Advocte, and tennis organisers Subhan Ahmed and Kamran Khalil, here at PPP Central Secretariat the PPP leader said that annual Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Tournament had been taking place at this venue for long.  He said PPP had serious concerns over the operation of CDA, adding that a jungle was converted into tennis courts and CDA had demolished it.
Senator Taj Haider said that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto is also aware of this issue, adding that CDA did crime and this issue was also taken up in Senate. PPP leader Sibtul Hasan sad that international players used to play at these courts and representatives of international tennis federation also used to visit there. He said: “We were not defaulter of CDA and through a conspiracy operation was launched,” he said and urged the CDA to reconstruct the facility, adding that a lease granted by the interior ministry was valid till 2035, but despite this CDA conducted the operation.
Advocate Khurram Baig said that despite stay orders, operation was conducted, which is a contempt of court, “so we are going to file contempt of court,” he said.
Last week, CDA had demolished several rooms and a fence constructed on the site.
When contacted, an officer of CDA said that civic agency did nothing wrong rather operation was conducted to remove illegal construction, adding CDA never granted any lease, rather the said area is part of park and CDA removed encroachment from the private persons [operators of tennis academy] and courts are still there and available for public free of cost.
He also shared a written response, which stated there were many complaints regarding demands for payment to use tennis courts: “The Park at Embassy road was one park, which was then illegally bifurcated into two by the construction of rooms and boundary walls by private persons inside the park,” he said and there were complaints of demand of fee by private person for using tennis courts developed on state land. “We restored the park into original form after demolishing illegally constructed rooms in the light of high court orders regarding public places,” he said and added that tennis court facilities and park remain available to the public free of cost, but role of private person has been ended.

11,World cooperation sought to fight human smuggling,"The conference presented a unique opportunity to forge stronger partnerships and drive meaningful progress in the fight against migrant smuggling, says the UNODC Representative in Pakistan.","ISLAMABAD: Recognising the severity of migrant smuggling, a regional conference on Friday invited international cooperation essential to combating this serious crime effectively.
To address the pressing issue of migrant smuggling, the Federal Investigation Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs jointly organised a two-day regional conference in collaboration with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the European Union (EU) at the Marriott Hotel Islamabad.
Migrant smuggling has emerged as a lucrative criminal enterprise with minimal risks for perpetrators. Exploiting the desperation of individuals seeking better opportunities, smugglers operate within well-organised, transnational networks.
Speaking on the significance of the workshop, Foreign Secretary Syrus Sajjad Qazi emphasised the importance of leveraging regional and international partnerships to tackle the complexities associated with irregular migration. Syrus Qazi stressed the need for a comprehensive approach that ensured safe, orderly, and regular migration while mitigating the adverse effects of irregular migration.
Jeremy Milsom, the UNODC Representative in Pakistan, underscored the urgency of collaborative efforts following tragic incidents such as the capsizing of a trawler off southern Greece in June 2023. The accident claimed the lives of 350 Pakistani nationals. Highlighting the gravity of the situation, Jeremy Milsom reiterated the call for enhanced cooperation among nations to address the challenges posed by migrant smuggling.
The conference, held under the PROTECT: Improving Migration Management and Migrant Protection in Selected Silk Route Countries project, funded by the European Union, aimed to facilitate information-sharing among participating countries and promote victim-centred approaches to combat migrant smuggling.
Philipp Gross, Deputy Head of the EU Delegation to Pakistan, emphasised the pivotal role of regional cooperation in addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by human trafficking and migrant smuggling. Gross highlighted the critical routes originating in Pakistan, traversing through Iran and Turkey, and ultimately reaching the European Union, underscoring the necessity of formal and informal cooperation mechanisms to disrupt criminal networks and safeguard vulnerable migrants.
The European Union’s launch of the Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling in November 2023 reflected its commitment to strengthening international cooperation to prevent and respond to migrant smuggling. The organisers maintained that the regional conference served as a testament to the collaborative efforts of key countries along critical migration routes, aimed at countering this crime while addressing root causes such as poverty and conflict.
Participants engaged in discussions regarding common challenges, best practices in border security, and investigations and explored the feasibility of establishing a regional task force to address migrant smuggling.
In conclusion, Jeremy Milsom stressed the importance of proactive measures in combating migrant smuggling, highlighting the support provided by the European Union in achieving significant milestones in this endeavor. The conference, he emphasised, presented a unique opportunity to forge stronger partnerships and drive meaningful progress in the fight against migrant smuggling.
