0,Bagnaia hits back with record Jerez practice lap,"Martin leads the championship with 80 points, from Enea Bastianini (59 pts), Vinales (56), Costa (54) and Bagnaia (50).","JEREZ DE LA FRONTERA: A wounded world champion roared back on Friday, Francesco Bagnaia lowering his own lap record in practice at Jerez for this weekend’s Spanish MotoGP.
The factory Ducati rider, champion in 2022 and 2023, won the opener in Qatar yet has subsequently fallen to fifth in 
the championship standings coming into this fourth round of the season.
But the Italian sent out a warning to the pretenders to his crown by dominating the Friday practice with a sizzling late lap of 1min 36.025 to better his own previous best time at the circuit in Andalusia of 1min 36.170 set in 2022.
He topped second practice ahead of Maverick Vinales, the Aprilia rider on a cloud after his heroics at the Grand Prix of the Americas, where he won both the sprint and the race itself off a record pole.
In third came Marc Marquez, who briefly led the US race before abruptly parting company with his Ducati satellite Gresini bike.
Jorge Martin, who leads this season’s championship by 21 points (30 clear of Bagnaia), posted the fifth fastest time, four tenths of a second quicker than teenaged rookie sensation Pedro Acosta.
The top 10 automatically go through to the second qualifying session shaping the first four rows of the grid on Saturday, this group joined by the two fastest riders from the first session.
Saturday qualifying is followed by the 12 lap sprint race, with the 25-lap main event on Sunday where Bagnaia is seeking a third consecutive win.
In the championship Martin leads on 80 points, from Enea Bastianini (59 pts), Vinales (56), Costa (54) and Bagnaia (50).

1,City crush Brighton to keep pressure on Arsenal in title race,BRIGHTON: Manchester City are in ominous form as the champions chase an unprecedented fou­rth successive Premier...,"BRIGHTON: Manchester City are in ominous form as the champions chase an unprecedented fou­rth successive Premier League crown. 
Phil Foden struck twice as City cut Arsenal’s lead to one point with a game in hand with a ruthless 4-0 victory at Brighton & Hove Albion on Thursday. 
A day after Liverpool’s title challenge suffered a huge blow with a 2-0 defeat at Everton, City kept up the pressure on Arsenal with a dominant display. 
Kevin De Bruyne’s header put them in front before Foden netted twice in the first half to put the result beyond doubt. Julian Alvarez ended his goal drought after half-time to ensure injured striker Erling Haaland wasn’t missed as his absence with a muscle problem stretched to a second successive game. 
“The statement is three points,” City manager Pep Guardiola told Sky Sports. “There are five games left, we know the margins are so tight. We have to win every one. Each game we are closer.” 
He added that it remains very much a three-team race with third-placed Liverpool two points adrift of Guardiola’s men. 
“What happened to Liverpool, two defeats in a row, it can happen to Arsenal, it can happen to us,” Guardiola said. “What is important is that still we are there. There is a lot of games to play.” 
Guardiola’s team, who have a game in hand on both Arsenal and Liverpool, will be crowned champions if they win their last five matches, starting at Nottingham Forest on Sunday, while Arsenal head to Tottenham Hotspur just hours earlier. 
With at least four goals in each of their last four league games, City are rounding into form at just the right moment once again. 
“I said before, what we have done in the past, it does not mean we will do it in the future,” said Guardiola. “We know the margins are so tight. We have to win every one. Each game we are closer.” 
De Bruyne’s superb diving hea­der that lifted the ball over Brig­hton keeper Jason Steele into the roof of the net put City ahead in the 17th minute at the Amex Stadium. 
Foden scored his first with a deflected free kick and Brighton defensive errors allowed Bernardo Silva to win the ball and set up the England midfielder to sweep a shot into the bottom corner before halftime. 
Alvarez completed the rout midway through the second half and Brighton, who remained 11th in the table, never looked capable of launching a fightback. 
City are unbeaten in 30 games in all competitions with 24 wins and six draws, making them the third English top-flight side to reach that landmark after Nottingham Forest (40 in 1978) and Manchester United (34 in 1993-94 and 33 in 1998-99). 
“City are one of the best teams in the world and today they played very well,” Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi said. 
Guardiola’s side remain favourites to claim the English crown but unlike last season when Arsenal collapsed down the home stretch under City’s relentless pressure, they seem capable of lasting the distance. 
DERBY TEST 
Arsenal, though, must win at bitter rivals Tottenham for a second consecutive season to keep City at bay. 
Like all big city derbies, pride and bragging rights are always huge motivating factors, but the fact this one arrives with Arsenal glimpsing a first title for 20 years adds considerably more spice to the occasion. 
It looks the toughest of Arsenal’s final four games but they will head to Tottenham with confidence brimming after Tuesday’s 5-0 mauling of Chelsea. 
It is a long time since Arsenal faced their arch-rivals in such a position and probably the last occasion in which either had serious title chances by the time of their second meeting of the season was in 2016. 
Then, it was Tottenham eyeing a long-awaited title but a 2-2 home draw damaged those ambitions and Leicester City went on a fairytale run to glory. 
Arsenal re-established superiority over Tottenham last season when they were runners-up behind City, ending a streak of six seasons finishing below Tottenham in the league. 
Fifth-placed Tottenham’s hopes of finishing in the top-four and returning to the Champions League hang by a thread and defeat on Sunday could end any realistic hopes they have, especially if fourth-placed Aston Villa beat Chelsea and move nine points clear. 
Irrespective of form and league positions, however, Tottenham will be desperate to sabotage Arsenal’s quest for glory on Sunday and are quite capable of doing so. 
Liverpool kick off the weekend action at West Ham United when anything other than victory could all but end their hopes of winning the title in Juergen Klopp’s farewell season.

Marta, who has been pla­y­ing in the United States with Orlando Pride since 2017, hopes to make her sixth appearance at the Oly­m­pics at this year’s Paris Games.
“If I go to the Olympics, I will enjoy every moment, because, regardless of whe­ther I go to the Olympics or not, this is my last year with the national team,” Marta told CNN on Thursday.
“There will be no more Marta from 2025 in the national team as an athlete.
“I am very calm about this, because I see with gre­at optimism this development that we are having in relation to young athletes.”
Marta, affectionately known as  “Queen Marta”, is the all-time highest scorer for Brazil with 116 goals in 175 matches.
She is also the top scorer in the Women’s World Cup with 17 goals, finishing runner-up in 2007. She has won three Copa America Femenina titles and was part of the Brazil team that claimed silver medals at the 2004 and 2008 Games.

4,Coleman believes Bolt’s 100m record could fall soon,SHANGHAI: American sprinter Christian Coleman believes that Usain Bolt’s 100-metres record of 9.58 seconds that ...,"SHANGHAI: American sprinter Christian Coleman believes that Usain Bolt’s 100-metres record of 9.58 seconds that has stood for 15 years is within reach and said there are several athletes fast enough to break it.
“It seems like the times being run, 9.58 is obviously an extraordinary time but honestly I feel like it’s a lot of guys who are competing today who are not that far off, if the track gods see fit for it to happen,”
Coleman told reporters on Friday ahead of Saturday’s Shanghai Diamond League meet.
“But it has to be perfect conditions, on the right day, the right competition and the right venue ... if you’re focusing on running properly, like executing a good race, I feel like those type of magical moments happen.
“I feel like it’s in my wheelhouse, but I don’t try to put too much emphasis or thought on it. I try to just focus on the next practice, the next rep, the next meet and just trying to improve and get better and better and the times will come.”
Jamaica’s Bolt set his 100m record in Berlin in 2009. American Tyson Gay is the second quickest after Bolt with a time of 9.69 set in Shanghai the same year.
Christian Miller, a 17-year-old from the US., ran 9.93 — the fastest time in the world this year — at a high school meet in Florida last weekend.
Coleman, a five-times world champion who has a 100m personal best of 9.76 set in 2019, takes on US rival Fred Kerley, silver medallist in the 100m at the Tokyo Olympics, for the first time this outdoor season at the Shanghai Diamond League meet on Saturday.
“I’m the fittest I’ve ever been,” said Kerley, who clocked his quickest 100m of 9.76 in 2022.  “I’m learning how to run the 100 still, me and my coaches are working on the phases of the races instead of just running the race like I always have.”
The 28-year-old Coleman raced to gold in the 60m at the world indoor championships earlier this season in Glasgow.

Bayern, who first face Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday with the league title already secured by Bayer Leverkusen, will part ways with Tuchel at the end of a disappointing domestic the season, a year earlier than his contract.
Austria coach Ralf Rangnick confirmed this week there had been contact with Bayern while some other coaches have been linked with the club.
Tuchel, however, said the team was shutting out any such distractions as they chase a spot in the Champions League final.
“In the next 11 days it can only be football and the goals we can still reach,” Tuchel told a press conference. “We want to collect points to get the best result and reach the Champions League final.
“For anything else there is just no capacity at the moment, whether it is comfortable or uncomfortable despite the many issues.”

Rocha had been serving as interim president after Luis Rubiales resigned in September after the scandal over allegations of an unsolicited kiss to player Jenni Hermoso at the Women’s World Cup which led to a FIFA suspension.
“Pedro Rocha has today been proclaimed the new president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), after having received the support of the majority of the assembly members of this institution that governs Spanish football,” the RFEF statement said.
“The process followed the procedure agreed by the Electoral Commission, which met this morning, and the timetable that was established for these elections.”
The Spanish government said on Thursday it would use a special committee to oversee the country’s scandal-hit football federation, after Spanish police searched the RFEF headquarters as part of a corruption investigation in March.
Rocha, who was placed under investigation by a judge this month after testifying as a witness in court, said on April 16 he had  “no knowledge nor, therefore, any responsibility for the facts that are being investigated”.

7,"Iconic shared Olympic gold moment will not be repeated, says Barshim",PARIS: Two athletes sharing Olympic gold in a near-empty stadium in Tokyo caught the imagination of an expectant...,"PARIS: Two athletes sharing Olympic gold in a near-empty stadium in Tokyo caught the imagination of an expectant audience across the world, which was at the time ravaged by Covid-19.
Mutaz Ezza Barshim embraced his old friend Gianmarco Tamberi at the end of the men’s high jump as the judges confirmed the double gold for the Qatari and the Italian who have known each other for years dating back to competing as youths.
“To be honest, it will never happen again,” Barshim told AFP in an interview.
“That moment, we’ll never share that again. It was a one-time thing. Coming back from injuries and a dark place, I wanted to do something different, something with a different meaning.
“I’m glad it touched so many people’s hearts, but we are sports people, we are professionals, we always want to be the best, we have that fire, ‘I want to beat you, you want to beat me’.”
Barshim said he felt  “lucky” to have shared the gold with Tamberi.
“We’ve been competing since 2010 and came to pro level together,” he explained.
“As professional athletes we deal with a lot. There’s one thing which is the biggest thing and that is injury. In 2018, I injured my left Achilles, broke both my ligaments and it was a very dark time for me, mentally and physically.
“One second you are the best and a few moments later you’re on a wheelchair and they’re dragging you out of the surgery room.
“Gianmarco, my friend, had a similar injury in 2016 just before the Rio Olympics which prevented him from being there.
“When the bar was 2.37 metres in Tokyo and me and him cleared at the first attempt, we looked back and there was no one left, it was emotional. So it was a tie.
“I asked ‘can we share?’. The reply was ‘yeah it’s possible’ and that was it! We didn’t even discuss things. I looked at Gian­marco’s eyes, he looked at me, we jumped, we hugged and the rest is history, that’s one of the moments that will stick forever.”
Barshim joked that World Athletics plans to award every event winner prize money of $50,000 (46,000 euros) would also guarantee no further shared gold.
“It’s not happening, 50 or 500, no sharing!” said the 32-year-old, who also has three world outdoor titles to his name.
“Anything offered in terms of a prize is good for the athletes, it’s motivation. These athletes work really hard and sacrifice and this sort of prize is very important.
“Prize money in athletics doesn’t compare to football or basketball. It’s a good start.”
Barshim kicked off his outdoor season with second place at the Xiamen Diamond League meeting last week and will stay in China for the Suzhou of the elite one-day circuit on Saturday bef­ore returning home to Doha for the next instalment there on May 10.
“After I’ll take some time off and hopefully peak at the Olym­pics,” Barshim said, adding he was looking forward to fans’ to Paris after Covid-blighted Tokyo Games.
“In terms of having the Olympics with fans back again, it’s amazing. I love adrenaline, when the crowd is back,” he said.
“We didn’t have that in Tokyo because of Covid but somehow we felt so ready because it was already postponed for one year. There was a lot of circling, but when it finally happened we were like kids going to Disneyland. We didn’t need fans to feel the hype.”

8,"Swiatek, Gauff through in Madrid Open as Osaka falls","MADRID: World number one Iga Swiatek beat Wang Xiyu 6-1, 6-4 to reach the third round of the Madrid Open on Thursday...","MADRID: World number one Iga Swiatek beat Wang Xiyu 6-1, 6-4 to reach the third round of the Madrid Open on Thursday as she bids to win the competition for the first time.
Coco Gauff sailed through to the third round with a 6-0, 6-0 thumping of Arantxa Rus, while Liudmila Samsonova ousted Naomi Osaka in three sets.
Runner-up last year, Swiatek bounced back from her semi-final defeat by Elena Rybakina in Stuttgart with a largely comfortable straight sets victory.
The Pole, a four-time Grand Slam winner and an expert on clay, wobbled in the second set as Wang won three games in a row but recovered to triumph in one hour 16 minutes.
“I love this place — I got to know the city a little better last year,” Swiatek said.  “So this time I feel more comfortable around.”
Madrid is the only major European clay tournament that three-time French Open champion Swiatek has yet to win.
Swiatek coasted through the first set, breaking twice for a 4-0 lead. She wrapped up it up with another break, leaving Wang no chance of reaching her red-hot backhand return.
The Doha and Indian Wells winner took a 4-1 lead in the second set but Wang fought her way back in for 4-4, before the top seed steeled herself to hold.
Wang then handed the second set on a plate to Swiatek with two double faults, and the Pole will face 27th seed Sorana Cirstea in the third round.
Earlier, Gauff, 20, earned the first ‘double bagel’ victory of her career in a WTA Tour main draw event in only 51 minutes against her 33-year-old Dutch opponent Rus.
The American saved four break points in the match to become the third player ever to win 6-0, 6-0 in the Madrid Open main draw.
World number three Gauff will face Ukraine’s Dayana Yastremska next.
Samsonova brought former world number one Osaka’s return to clay to a halt with a 6-2, 4-6, 7-5 victory.
Four-time Grand Slam champion Osaka twice battled back from a break down in the second set to force a decisive third but world number 17 Samsonova eventually ground out the win.
Japanese star Osaka returned to tennis in January after a long break and earned her first victory on clay for two years on Wednesday against Greet Minnen.
However Russian 15th seed Samsonova, whom Osaka beat at Indian Wells in March, was able to end a four-match losing streak with her victory in two hours 22 minutes in the Spanish capital.
Hard-court expert Osaka, 26, is not overly fond of the red dirt and has not won back-to-back matches on the surface since 2019.
She lost last week at the Rouen Open in France against Martina Trevisan in her first match back on clay but improved this week.
“I felt — I don’t want to say happy — I felt good that I was able to fight back,” said Osaka.
“I think it’s a big difference from my match in France, so I was happy that I learned from that match, but obviously really sad that I lost.”
Samsonova raced into a 4-0 first set lead, breaking in the first and third games as Osaka struggled.
“Honestly, it’s not the sliding part for me, it’s the touch,” said Osaka. “I feel like I’m getting the balls, I’m just not really placing them well.”
Samsonova will face Madison Keys in the next round.
NADAL OUTCLASS BLANCH
Meanwhile in the Madrid Open men’s first round fixture on Thursday, Rafael Nadal thrashed 16-year-old wild  card Darwin Blanch 6-1, 6-0 and will face Australian 10th seed Alex de Minaur next. 
The 22-time Grand Slam champion broke the American at the first  opportunity in the second game before grabbing the first set in just 28  minutes. 
Nadal, who last claimed the title on  Madrid’s clay in 2017, broke again to take the lead in the second set  and kept up the pace, giving a tennis masterclass to Blanch who is still  seeking his first tour win. 
The age gap between the pair was 21 years and 117 days, the biggest between two opponents at ATP Masters 1000 level. 
The American teen committed 27 unforced errors in what was his  second ATP tour match after he had made his debut last month in Miami. 
“I think today I played against someone with a great future in front of him,” Nadal said.  “(But) Today he was making mistakes. 
“I tried to be there and be solid all the time without taking a  lot of risks. I’m happy to be through and I wish him all the very best. 
“For me after how things developed the last few years, every time I  have a chance to be on court on this amazing stadium with unconditional  support means a lot to me. Trying to enjoy every moment.”
Despite the ease of his victory, Nadal said it did not mean anything in terms of his prospects of competing at his beloved Roland Garros.
“It doesn’t change my perspective on Paris and it will not change here, I’ll make a decision after Rome.” 
The win was Nadal’s record-extending 57th victory in Madrid, a tournament that he has won five times. 
He will play world number 11 De Minaur in the second round on Saturday.

9,Greece hands Olympic flame to Paris,Ten thousand torchbearers will then carry the flame across 64 French territories.,"ATHENS: Greece on Friday handed over the Olympic flame of the 2024 Games to Paris organisers in a ceremony at the Athens marble stadium where the competition was revived nearly 130 years ago.
Hellenic Olympic Committee chairman Spyros Capralos handed the torch to Paris Olympics chief organiser Tony Estanguet at the Panathenaic Stadium, where the first modern Olympics were held in 1896.
Estanguet in a speech said the goal for Paris was to organise  “spectacular but also more responsible Games, which will contribute towards a more inclusive society.”
Organisers want to ensure  “that the biggest event in the world plays an accelerating role in addressing the crucial questions of our time,” said Estanguet, a member of France’s Athens 2004 Olympics team who won gold in the slalom canoe event.
A duo of French champions, Beijing 2022 ice dance gold medallist Gabriella Papadakis and former swimmer Beatrice Hess, one of the most successful Paralympians in history, carried the flame during the final relay leg into the Panathenaic Stadium.
Nana Mouskouri, the 89-year-old Greek singer with a worldwide following, performed the anthems of France and Greece at the ceremony.
After spending the night at the French embassy in Athens, the flame on Saturday will begin its journey to France on board the 19th-century three-masted barque Belem.
On Sunday, the ship will pass from the Corinth Canal — a feat of 19th century engineering constructed with the contribution of French banks and engineers.
The Belem is set to reach Marseille — a city founded by ancient Greek colonists around 600 BCE — on May 8.
Over 1,000 vessels will accompany its approach to the harbour, local officials have said.
French swimmer Florent Manaudou will be the first torch bearer in Marseille. His sister Laure was the second torch bearer in ancient Olympia, where the flame was lit on April 16.
Ten thousand torchbearers will then carry the flame across 64 French territories.
It will travel through more than 450 towns and cities, and dozens of tourist attractions during its 12,000-kilometre (7,500-mile) journey through mainland France and overseas French territories in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean and Pacific.
On July 26, it will form the centrepiece of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony.
A French historical monument launched just weeks after the Athens 1896 Games were held, the Belem carried out trade journeys to Brazil, Guyana and the Caribbean for nearly two decades.
Hours before the handover ceremony, the flame passed from Marathon, the town where the classic 42-kilometre endurance race, a key Olympic event, sets off annually.
The torch harks back to the ancient Olympics when a sacred flame burned throughout the Games. The tradition was revived in 1936 for the Berlin Games.
During the 11-day relay on Greek soil, some 600 torchbearers carried the flame over a distance of over 5,000 kilometres (3,100 miles) through over 50 towns and cities.

10,T20 World Cup remains Pakistan’s focus despite possibility of series defeat against New Zealand,"""We are focusing on the World Cup, which is why we’re making changes in every match,” says Fakhar.","LAHORE: The upcoming T20 World Cup remains Pakistan focus despite their loss to a depleted New Zealand side in the fourth Twenty20 International here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Thursday.
The result confirmed the hosts would not be able to win the five-match series even if they trump New Zealand in the final match at the same venue on Saturday. A victory for Pakistan would see the series end 2-2, with the two teams sharing the winners’ trophy.
After their seven-wicket defeat in the third match in Rawalpindi, Pakistan had gone into the first fixture in Lahore with five changes, with mainstays Mohammad Rizwan, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah not featuring.
While the changes may have had a role in Pakistan’s four-wicket loss, for the national side’s management, testing less experienced players to strengthen the bench means more with the World Cup less than two months away.
“When your main players don’t play it does make a difference,” Pakistan batter Fakhar Zaman, whose effort of 61 off 45 went in vain on Thursday, admitted. “But we are focusing on the World Cup, which is why we’re making changes in every match.”
New Zealand are touring Pakistan with their first-choice players absent, majorly due to their involvement in the ongoing Indian Premier League. Led by off-spinner Michael Bracewell, the BlackCaps contingent are being considered as second, if not third-string. Their opponents’ standing has made defeats in the last two matches embarrassing for Pakistan. 
“No one likes to lose a match at the international level but again for each one of us the World Cup and finding the right combination for it matters the most,” Fakhar noted. “Meanwhile, we will try our best to win the next match.
“Both things are important, the World Cup comes after a long gap, but it is also important to win individual matches at the international level.”
A newly-formed selection committee and a revamped coaching setup ahead of the New Zealand series has adopted a rotation policy focused on preparing Pakistan for the World Cup — to be held in the United States and the West Indies in June.
The management, Fakhar revealed, has clearly communicated to players about their roles and the number of opportunities they will be provided. 
“If I talk about myself, the management had informed me before the series that I will not play the first three matches,” said the flamboyant southpaw. “Similarly, each player was given clarity over the matches they will feature in and the ones they won’t play.”
MARGINAL ERRORS
Pakistan head coach Azhar Mahmood, who has taken up the role on a consultancy basis only for the New Zealand series, believed the two teams were separated in the fourth match only by margins.
The former all-rounder pointed out at intricate details that gave New Zealand the edge throughout the match, while hoping Pakistan will work on their shortcomings. 
“There were a few positives for us as we scored more boundaries than New Zealand,” Azhar said. “We also bowled more dot balls but they just took more doubles than us. These are areas of concern for us and we’re constantly working on it.”
The 49-year-old was did not seem to be worried about Pakistan losing three wickets in the powerplay, which saw Saim Ayub and Usman Khan — both being tested as potential first-choice players — along with captain Babar Azam depart early.
For Azhar, the intent to score mattered more than keeping wickets in hand. 
“We always talk about showing intent,” he observed. “The way Usman Khan showed intent today was pleasant to watch. He played some good shots but couldn’t perform the way we wanted him to. But intent-wise, he was spot on.”
While Pakistan will be desperate to win the final match and draw the series, there are chances of rain playing spoilsport. Clouds hovered over the city after a storm followed by a spell of rain on Friday. 
New Zealand were to go for an optional practice session but that was also called off due to rain. Meanwhile, Pakistan chose to rest on Friday.

11,China to ‘actively cooperate’ with WADA audit,BEIJING: China’s anti-doping agency said on Friday it will cooperate with a compliance audit ordered by the World...,"BEIJING: China’s anti-doping agency said on Friday it will cooperate with a compliance audit ordered by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) involving a case where 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a prescription heart drug.
“CHINADA will actively cooperate with the coming audit by WADA, and provide assistance where needed,” the China Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) said in a statement.
WADA said on Thursday it would send a compliance audit team to China to  “assess the current state of the cou­ntry’s anti-doping program” run by body CHINADA. In its statement, CHINADA said it  “will work for the rights and interests of clean athletes and the integrity in sport”.
WADA has faced criticism since media reports that the swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine (TMZ) — which can enhance performance — ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 but were not sanctioned after WADA accepted the argument of Chinese authorities that the case was caused by food contamination.
On Thursday, WADA said on it had asked an independent prosecutor to review its handling of the case of the Chinese swimmers.
CHINADA said the world body’s request for an independent review was  “a clear demonstration of fairness, openness and transparency of WADA”.
The head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), Travis Tygart, has called the situation a  “potential cover-up” and USADA on Thursday branded WADA’s announcement of an independent investigation  “self-serving”.

They defeated their Asian rivals 11-10 on penalties after a 2-2 draw in Doha on Thursday night.
The top three teams will qualify for this summer’s Olympic Games in Paris while the fourth place side will face an Asian-African playoff with Guinea in May.
“Praise God, semifinal! An incredible win against South Korea, the Asian Giant,” wrote Indonesian football association president Erick Thohir on Instagram.
Rafael Struick scored twice for Indonesia who were pegged back twice by a Komang Teguh own goal and a Jeong Sang-bin strike.
South Korea went down to 10 men in the 70th minute but held on for penalties.
Indonesia’s Pratama Arhan scored the decisive penalty after Lee Kang-hee’s spot-kick was saved.
South Korea’s loss leaves them without an Olympic spot for the first time since the 1980s.

13,West Indies edge Pakistan in last-ball thriller  to clinch first women’s T20,"Ramharack finishes with four wickets for 15 runs, while Qiana Joseph, Hayley Matthews and Afy Fletcher take a wicket each.","KARACHI: West Indies women stunned Pakistan as they edged the hosts by one in a last-ball thriller here at the National Bank Stadium on Friday.
Pakistan, chasing a seemingly easy target of 123 runs, were cruising towards it until a trigger was collapsed and the West Indies ensured they made the most of it.
The Nida Dar-led side had got off to a decent start in terms of runs but lost openers Gul Feroza and Sidra Ameen and Ayesha Zafar by the halfway stage.
The incoming Nida arrived right in the midst of the crisis and started Pakistan’s rescue mission. She first combined with Muneeba Ali for 22 runs off 20 balls before accumulating 28 off 26 with fellow veteran Aliya Riaz.
However, when Karishma Ramharack got Aliya to leave Pakistan at 104-5 at the start of the 18th over, things got out of control for the home side. The bowler took two more wickets in the same over, first that of Fatima Sana and then Nida herself, leaving Pakistan in tatters.
Yougsters Najiha Alvi and Tuba Hassan still took Pakistan far enough that they needed two runs off the last ball, which Najiha missed and still tried to complete a desperate single in an attempt to tie the match and take it to the super over, but West Indies wicket-keeper Shemaine Campbell hit the stumps to run Tuba out.
Ramharack finished with four wickets for 15 runs, while Qiana Joseph, Hayley Matthews and Afy Fletcher took a wicket each.
Earlier, West Indies struggled with the bat after winning the toss as they lost their in-form captain Matthews on the second ball of their innings.
Their highest scorer was Joseph, who added 34 off 36 to the total, while Stafanie Taylor scored 30 off 32.
The two had combined for a run-a-ball 55-run partnership after the dismissal of openers Matthews and her partner Campbell. But after that, none of the West Indies batter could drag the visitors out of trouble.
Pacer Fatima took three wickets for 24 in her four overs, while spinner Sadia Iqbal, who had made the first breakthorugh, bagged two scalps.
Diana Baig, Nida and Tuba took a wicket each.
Scores in brief: WEST INDIES 122-9 in 20 overs (Qiana Joseph 34, Stafanie Taylor 30; Fatima Sana 3-24); PAKISTAN 121-8 in 20 overs (Nida Dar 27, Sidra Ameen 23; Karishma Ramharack 4-15).
