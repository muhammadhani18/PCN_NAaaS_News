0,Weekly inflation rises 27pc,"Products with increased prices include potatoes, powdered milk, vegetable ghee, pulse mash, sugar, gur, cooked daal and mutton.","ISLAMABAD: The unprecedented gas price shock and some essential eatables led to an increase in short-term inflation, measured by the Sensitive Price Index (SPI), of almost 27 per cent on an annual basis in the week ending April 25, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics on Friday.

1,Regulator gently chides Discos for ‘inefficiencies’,Hints at allowing charging Rs23bn more for March.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Friday criticised the power companies for inefficiencies and the use of expensive power plants despite the availability of cheaper sources but hinted at allowing them to charge another Rs22.8 billion to consumers in the billing month of May.
At a public hearing presided over by Nepra Chairman Waseem Mukhtar, it was reported that even though hydropower supply with no fuel cost was actually higher than estimated in the reference tariff, non-utilisation of cheaper plants resulted in a higher average fuel cost. Member Nepra Rafique A. Shaikh expressed concerns over such a state of affairs and noted that cheaper plants remained closed while expensive plants were being operated.
The hearing was told that the share of hydropower supply amounted to more than 27pc of the total grid against a target of less than 22.2pc. On the other hand, local coal-based plants supplied only 10.6pc of the national grid supply against a target of almost 15pc. As a result, the cost of coal-based fuel increased to Rs16.78 per unit against a targeted rate of Rs9.39 per unit.
Another major factor was the domestic gas-based power generation. In the reference tariff, the gas-based fuel cost for almost 11pc share was assumed at Rs7.92 per unit, which went up to Rs13.69 per unit because of an increase in gas price while its general share was lower than 10pc. Also, the RLNG-based power supply was initially expected to be less than 3pc at Rs23.84 per unit, but its share went beyond 20pc, although at a lower fuel cost of Rs22.2 per unit. Its larger-than-targeted power supply also aggravated the average basked price.

Hints at allowing charging Rs23bn more for March 

Representatives of the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Power Division said expensive plants had to be used because of transmission system constraints and a week-long maintenance plan for the transmission system. Power consumption was also continuously declining because of expensive power and the increasing use of solar power. In March, consumption fell by 8pc.
The CPPA demanded Rs 2.94 per unit in additional fuel costs to recover from consumers through May 2024 bills. The proposed additional FCA is almost 46pc higher than the pre-fixed fuel cost of Rs6.44 per unit already charged to consumers in March. This calls into question the capabilities of the power sector bureaucracy to forecast fuel costs even for 6-7 months. The additional FCAs have ranged between 50 and 115pc in recent months compared to the pre-determined fuel costs notified at the start of the current fiscal year.
This increase in FCA is on top of an about 26pc increase in the annual base tariff and another 10pc hike under the quarterly tariff adjustment currently in place and being charged to consumers at the rate of Rs2.75 per unit. As a result, consumers continue to pay excessive bills despite lower consumption patterns even though more than 79pc of electricity came from local resources. Nepra has accepted the request for a public hearing on April 26.
In a petition, the CPPA, acting as a commercial agent of Discos, demanded an additional FCA of Rs2.94 per unit for electricity consumed in March. It claimed that reference fuel cost for March was set at Rs6.44 per unit but actual fuel cost more than doubled to Rs9.38 per unit. The average fuel cost in February also stood at about Rs9.42 per unit. It said about 8,023-gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity was generated at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs66.7bn (Rs8.3 per unit) in March, of which 7,756 GWh energy was delivered to Discos at the cost of Rs72.67bn (at Rs9.38 per unit).

2,Retailers not sharing flour price cut with consumers,Millers’ demand for export of surplus sugar pushes up local prices.,"KARACHI: Mill owners on Friday further reduced the rates of various flour varieties by Rs4 per kg to pass on the impact of huge arrival of cheap imported wheat in the country.
However, despite a persistent drop in flour rates at the wholesale stage, retailers are not fully passing on the benefit of price cut to consumers.
Former chairman of the Pakistan Flour Mills Association Chaudhry Mohammad Yousuf said the price of flour No 2.5 had been slashed to Rs92 per kg from Rs96 and that of fine and super fine to Rs120 from Rs123-124. 
In February, these varieties were available at Rs122 and Rs136-140 per kg. 
Mr Yousuf said import of around 3.5 million tonnes of wheat by the private sector from September 2023 to March 2024 amid rupee stability and falling world prices had averted major wheat and flour crises in the country, besides reducing the prices of various flour varieties. 

Millers’ demand for export of surplus sugar pushes up local prices

He said imported wheat is available at Rs8,400-8,500 per 100kg bag while the commodity from Sindh is being sold at Rs8,400 in the open market. He insisted that the millers and private sector cannot be blamed for any crisis for the growers as imports were initiated as per the government’s decision to provide relief to the inflation-hit consumers. 
“I personally think that the private sector has made extra imports as 2.5m tonnes of wheat were enough instead of huge 3.5m tonnes costing one billion dollars,” Mr Yousuf said. 
Disagreeing with the notion that growers are the losers now, he recalled that they had sold the grain at Rs5,000 per 40kg last year instead of the officially rate of Rs3,900. He urged the government to freely open wheat import and export of value-added wheat products, besides linking local flour rates with imported wheat rates. 
Consumers yet to get relief
Despite a persistent drop in mills flour rates, consumers are not getting a full relief as retailers are slowly passing on the price cut to the consumers. The retailers selling flour No 2.5 at Rs120-130 per kg and fine and super fine at Rs150-160, which otherwise should be below Rs100 per kg. 
Karachi Retail Grocers Group general secretary Farid Qureishi said retailers still held the old stocks purchased at higher rates, while some are facing losses by selling flour at reduced rates despite purchasing the commodity at higher rates. 
“Besides commodities, the government should seriously ponder over the rising power and gas bills and soaring school fees which are eating up the bulk of consumers’ salary and income. Consumers need urgent relief in these areas to offset the rising cost of living,” he said. 
A commodity wholesaler said it appeared that the millers had grinded the entire imported wheat stock in order to avert any losses and clear the stocks in view of arrival of the new crop. 
Sugar export 
A spokesman for the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (Punjab Zone) said sugar prices in the world market are falling and the government should immediately allow export of 1.5 million tonnes of surplus sugar to ensure timely payments to the sugarcane growers and earn more foreign exchange. 
He said the landed cost of imported sugar came to Rs240 per kg, or $553 per tonne, at Karachi Port, while the ex-mill rates at Jodia Bazaar and south Punjab are Rs134.25 and Rs135.75 per kg, respectively, instead of Rs145-150 as claimed by the market forces. 
The spokesman claimed that the cost of sugar production is Rs175 per kg due to purchase of sugarcane at Rs425-550 per 40kg from the growers, as compared to Rs300 last year. 
“Input costs like petroleum products, chemicals, interest rates, sales tax and labour have increased manifold.

3,PBC calls for coordinated policies to boost exports,"PBC chief executive Ehsan Malik recommends time-bound incentives to encourage existing exporters to grow, diversify the export basket and broaden their reach","KARACHI: Pakistan Business Council (PBC) has urged the government to adopt an aligned and consistent series of policies and actions to boost exports and encourage import substitution to address the silo working and fragmentation between ministries.
In a letter to Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan on Friday, PBC chief executive Ehsan Malik sought the prime minister’s ownership and quarterly progress review to give exports and self-reliance the importance they deserve from all the key ministries.
In a comprehensive list of proposals, he cited uncompetitive energy cost, high cost of borrowing, poor market access versus key sourcing alternatives, exchange rates which for long periods favour imports over exports, delay in making the Export-Import Bank fully operational, denial of adequate foreign exchange to develop local brands abroad, absence of FDI in export sectors, delays in tax refunds, a fiscal regime which makes it difficult to wash exports clean of all taxes and duties in the extended value chain and dysfunctional EPZs as the main reasons for Pakistan’s poor export performance.
He added that these would require the alignment of policies and close collaboration between the ministries of commerce, IT, industries, finance, energy, foreign affairs, health, communications, and the central bank.
Malik also recommended time-bound incentives to encourage existing exporters to grow, diversify the export basket and broaden their reach. Similarly, the PBC supported new exporters to be assisted in developing markets abroad.
On import substitution, the PBC recommended an industrial policy which promotes import substitution with the objective of feeding into exports. However, import substitution should not be used as an excuse for indefinitely depriving Pakistani exporters and consumers of quality products at competitive prices.
Open-ended protection for domestic industry hampers both domestic as well as global competitiveness. Industries currently protected from global competition need to have a sunset clause. 
At the same time, 
Mr Malik called for effective and timely enforcement of anti-dumping duties.
Smuggling and under-invoicing of imports undermine domestic manufacturing. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) with China and the UAE needs to be implemented.
