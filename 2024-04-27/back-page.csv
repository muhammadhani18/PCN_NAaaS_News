0,Gaza protests against Israel reach Europe,Demonstrations on campus start taking lead from widening US protests.,"PARIS: Student-led protests over the war in Gaza were widening in Europe on Friday as activists in France and Britain follow the lead of a campus demonstrations spreading in the US.
Protesters in Paris blocked an entrance to elite university Sciences Po on Friday, refusing to back down after a tent “occupation” was broken up by police a day earlier.
Activists at University College London were planning a rally in the name of a “global student movement for Palestine”, taking inspiration from protests at New York’s Columbia University.
Tensions flared in front of Paris’ prestigious Scie­nces Po University over the Israeli war on Gaza on Friday as pro-Israeli protesters came to challenge pro-Palestinian students occupying the building. Police moved in to keep the two groups apart.

Demonstrations on campus start taking lead from widening US protests

Pro-Palestinian students wore the black-and-white keffiyeh head scarf that has become an emblem of solidarity with Gaza.
They demanded the ins­titution condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza, in a protest that echoed similar demonstrations on US campuses.
“When we see what is happening in the United States, and now in Australia, we’re really hoping it will catch on here in France, the academic world has a role to play,” said 22-year-old Hicham, a master’s student in human rights and humanitarian studies at Sciences Po.
“We hope that will spread to all universities and beyond … we won’t give in until the genocide in Gaza ends,” said 20-year old Zoe, a master’s student in public administration at Sciences Po.
Later in the day, pro-Israel protesters, some wrapped in Israeli or French flags, walked to the building in protest.
Renewed clashes between police and students opposed to Israel’s war in Gaza broke out on US campuses on Thursday, raising questions about forceful methods being used to shut down protests that have intensified since mass arrests at Columbia University last week.
Israel has killed at least 34,305 Palestinians, most of them women and children, in its assault on Gaza.
Pro-Palestine camp at Germany’s parliament
In Germany’s capital Berlin, police on Friday began clearing a pro-Palestinian camp set up in front of the German parliament by activists demanding the government to stop arms exports to Israel and end the criminalisation of the Palestinian solidarity movement gaining momentum in US and other Western countries.
Police dismantled tents, forcibly removed protesters and blocked the surrounding area to stop others arriving at the camp.
The Berlin camp ‘Bese­tzung Gegen Besatzung’ — ‘Occupy Against Occu­pation’ — began on April 8, coinciding with the start of International Court of Justice hearings in Nicaragua’s case aga­inst Germany for providing military aid to Israel.
“The idea was to draw attention to that and … to the German comp­licity and active enabling of the Israeli genocide in Gaza,” the camp organiser, Jara Nassar, said.

“We’re not seeking victory; we’re here because we’re wounded. We demand an end to the bloodshed in Gaza, now,” she declares, her words echoing the collective anguish of those gathered.

A student at George Washington University (GWU), Michal arrived early at Thursday’s rally in the iconic University Yard (known locally as U-Yard), not merely to participate but to spearhead the protest. The yard pulsates with energy; it is the beating heart of the university, situated in a pivotal locale within the US capital, a stone’s throw from influential institutions such as the White House, World Bank and IMF headquarters, and only a short stroll from the State Department.
An expanse of determined students from eight universities in the Greater Washington area converged at U-Yard when I visited on Thursday, emboldened by a recent US court ruling affirming their right to protest.
Despite cautionary notices from university administrations barring external participation, approximately 30 faculty members from nearby Georgetown University defiantly marched to GWU to stand in solidarity with the cause.
David, a Christian from Karachi and a former GWU alumnus, remarked that there’s little the administration could do to suppress the protest, given the charged and determined participants. “If the Biden administration wants to end the protest, they need to halt the genocide in Gaza,” he told Dawn. “Nothing else would work.”
Many veiled their faces with the iconic keffiyeh, a symbol of unwavering solidarity in the face of Israeli oppression in Gaza. This checkered scarf, woven with threads of Palestinian nationalism, billowed in the wind as the protest swelled in numbers. The protesters at GWU are calling on the Biden administration to halt arms sales to Israel, support a ceasefire and want universities to divest from companies profiting from the conflict. Universities in America often invest funds in commercial organisations.
The coalition also involves students and faculty from Georgetown University, George Mason, the University of Maryland in Baltimore, Howard and Gallaudet.

Similar scenes are unfolding across the United States every day, with New York’s Columbia University emerging as a bastion of dissent. In these protests, the keffiyeh transcends mere fabric; it becomes a shield against oppression, a banner of resistance.
But amid the fervour, it is easy to forget just how much these brave demonstrators are putting on the line to make their voices heard; earlier this week, 104 students were arrested from the Columbia campus alone.
Crackdowns on protesters were also seen in Texas, where a large security presence was brought to bear with at least 50 demonstrators being picked up from the University of Texas in Austin. More than 100 were arrested at Emerson University, more than 40 rounded up at Yale and dozens more at the University of Southern California.
New York City, meanwhile, has emerged as the epicentre of this wave.
In the heart of the city that famously never sleeps, voices are rising in solidarity with Palestine, while on the opposite end of the country, the din of protesters at California’s storied UCLA and Berkeley schools has added fuel to the fire of resistance.
Many activists, left-leaning politicians and political commentators have condemned the use of law enforcement to break up largely peaceful protests, arguing that it violates the students’ free speech rights and will only serve to heighten the risk of serious clashes.
“Calling in police enforcement on nonviolent demonstrations of young students on campus is an escalatory, reckless, and dangerous act,” Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote on social media.
At night, tranquility envelops the U-Yard as the chants and drumbeats subsided. A group of Latin students, who had been vocal in their support for Palestine throughout the evening, dispersed, while four Jewish students who exercised their right to dissent by standing in the midst of the protest with a pro-Israeli banner, also packed up and left.

The pro-Palestinian demonstrators retreated to their tents in the U-Yard, preparing to spend the night. Huddled around their tents, they shared food and engaged in conversation, intermittently drifting off to sleep.
Come the next morning, the protests pick up right where they left off, with even more people joining its ranks.
Liberal arts colleges and institutions that preach ethical and moral lessons of human rights and democratic values seem to be taking on the role of authoritarians by stifling peaceful protest.
The question the US must grapple with now is an existential one: are they still the good guys or have they become as authoritarian as those which they most reviled?

2,Qatar ‘strikes back’ at Gaza mediation critics,Says decision to re-evaluate its role was pro­m­pted by frustration with pol­itical attacks including from figures in the Israeli government.,"DOHA / JERUSALEM: As a delegation from Gaza truce mediator Egypt arrived in Israel on Friday, criticism of Qatar over its role as a mediator between Israel and Hamas prompted a rare pushback by the Gulf state against its detractors.
Qatar, which has hosted Hamas’s political leadership since 2012 with the blessing of the US, has been engaged in months of behind-the-scenes talks, but in the face of calls — particularly from Israel and the US — for Qatar to exert pressure on Hamas, the emirate has warned it could walk away as a mediator.
This week, foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said the decision to re-evaluate its role was pro­m­pted by frustration with pol­itical attacks including from figures in the Israeli government. 
“They all know what the Qatari role is, its nature, and its details during the previous stage and they lied,” the Qatari spokesman said, referring to November’s week-long truce when scores of Israeli and foreign hostages were released through Doha’s mediation.
Egyptian officials in Israel
A team from Gaza war mediator Egypt arrived in Israel on Friday for a bid to reignite stalled truce and prisoner swap talks.
The signs of fresh truce talks come alongside Israeli preparations for a military push in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah. 
There has been “noticeable progress in bringing the views of the Egyptian and Israeli delegations closer”, said Al-Qahera News, which is linked to Egyptian state intelligence services.

3,Rahul in fray from Kerala as India moves into second phase of polls,Indian SC turns down opposition plea to make EVMs more transparent.,"NEW DELHI: The second phase of Indian elections on Friday saw 88 constituencies in the fray, including Rahul Gandhi’s contest in communist-ruled Kerala.
Speculation is rife that he could return to Amethi in Uttar Pradesh to challenge BJP’s Smriti Irani. The cabinet minister defeated him in the traditional Gandhi family hub narrowly in 2019.
Alternate media claims Priyanka Gandhi will be the Congress candidate from the neighbouring Rae Bareli constituency after her mother Sonia Gandhi moved over to the Rajya Sabha.
A low voter turnout in Uttar Pradesh was below the 60 per cent overall voting in the second phase. Low voting is being seen as unfavourable for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the BJP’s bastion.

Modi appears to be in a bind against challenge from opposition alliance; Indian SC turns down opposition plea to make EVMs more transparent

Voters said they did not receive the usual voting slips or reminders from the RSS workers who otherwise shore up the BJP usually.
Mr Modi has veered between communal invective against Muslims and wooing Muslim women in the next meeting, announcing some Haj facilities for them. This is being seen as an indication that he is in a bind against a robust challenge from the INDIA alliance.
The election commission has issued a notice to the BJP president to explain Mr Modi’s controversial speeches. The Supreme Court has come to the rescue once again by turning down opposition demands to make the electronic voting machines more transparent.
Mr Modi on Friday demanded an apology from the opposition for “committing the sin of creating distrust” over EVMs. He was speaking at public rallies in Araria and Munger in Bihar when the Supreme Court’s order dismissing petitions came through.
“When the Congress, the [Rasht­riya Janata Dal] RJD and other INDIA alliance parties were in power, the poor, backwards and Dalits used to be deprived of their votes through booth capture. With the introduction of EVMs, they are no longer able to play their old game. Hence, they committed the sin of creating distrust against EVMs,” the prime minister alleged in Araria.
“The decision has exposed the Congress and other constituents of the opposition INDIA bloc,” he said, claiming that opposition parties had taken every opportunity to “defame” the Election Commission of India by raising questions on the credibility of EVMs.
As polling concluded for 88 seats across 13 states and Union Territories, Mr Modi expressed his gratitude to the voters. He said the second phase had been “too good”, adding that “the unparalleled support for NDA is going to disappoint the opposition even more”.
As per the election commission data, the average voter turnout stood at 60.96pc till 7pm, while the lone constituency going to polls in Tripura recorded the highest turnout with 78.53pc eligible voters casting their votes. The lowest turnout was recorded in Uttar Pradesh at 53.67pc.
A third of the total 543 Lok Sabha seats — including all the seats in Kerala, Rajasthan, Manipur and Tripura, and 14 of the 28 seats in Karnataka — have now completed polling.
There were a total 1,202 candidates in the fray. The Dalit Bhaujan Samaj Party, seen as a disruptor of opposition unity, has fielded the most candidates in this phase at 74, followed by the BJP at 69 and the Congress at 68. Congreess-ruled Karnataka, with 14 seats going to polls, had the most candidates at 247, followed by Maharashtra (8 seats) at 204 and Kerala (all its 20 seats) at 189.

4,Scotland’s leader Humza Yousaf vows to win no-confidence vote,"His position now hangs on a knife-edge vote after almost all other parties, including his former coalition partners, said they would vote against him.","LONDON: Scotland’s First Mini­s­ter Humza Yousaf said he intended to fight a vote of no confidence called by political opponents following his decision to withdraw from a coalition agreement and try to run a minority government.
“I’m quite confident, very confident in fact, that I’ll be able to win that vote of no confidence,” he told Sky News on Friday.
Scottish National Party leader You­saf ended an alliance with the Scottish Greens after a dispute over a decision to scrap a climate change emissions reduction target last week.
The Scottish arm of the Conservative Party that governs Britain then said it would seek to topple Yousaf with a no-confidence motion, calling him a “lame duck”.
His position now hangs on a knife-edge vote after almost all other parties, including his former coalition partners, said they would vote against him.
With the Conservatives, Labour, Greens and Liberal Democrats all indicating they have no confidence in Yousaf, he would need the support of Ash Regan, a one-time leadership rival to Yousaf who acrimoniously left the SNP last year, to cling on as first minister. If Yousaf lost, parliament would have 28 days to choose a new first minister before an election was forced.
Poor judgement
The Scottish Labour Party said they would bring a separate motion of no confidence in the government, which could lead to Scottish elections more immediately.
“It would be untenable for the SNP to assume it can impose an­other unelected First Minister on Scotland,” leader Anas Sarwar said in a statement, saying an election was needed to give Scotland a “fresh start”.

5,Pecker admits he killed affair story to help Trump presidential bid,‘Timeline inconsistencies’ in publisher’s testimony noted during cross-examination,"NEW YORK: Former Natio­nal Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified on Friday at Donald Trump’s criminal trial that he suppressed a story about an alleged affair to help Trump’s 2016 presidential bid, even though it would have boosted sales of his tabloid.
Testifying for a third day, Pecker, 72, agreed with a prosecutor who asked whether it would have been “National Enquirer gold” to publish the story of former Playboy model Karen McDougal’s claim that she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007.
But Pecker said he opted not to run the story after paying McDougal for it, because it would have hurt the Republican Trump’s chances of winning the election over Democrat Hillary Clinton.
“You killed the story because it helped the candidate, Donald Trump?” prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked him. Pecker said yes.

‘Timeline inconsistencies’ in publisher’s testimony noted during cross-examination

The exchange bolstered previous testimony in which Pecker said he worked with Trump’s campaign to suppress allegations of adultery at a time when the then-presidential candidate was facing multiple accusations of sexual misbehavior.
Pecker is the first witness in the case, which accuses Trump, 77, of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.
He has testified that his tabloid paid to “catch and kill” two such stories and alerted Trump that Daniels was also looking to sell her story of a sexual encounter with Trump.
However, the defence side argued the hush-money payment was made to spare Trump’s family embarrassment, not bolster his campaign. 
Trump denies an encounter took place and has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Rhona Graff, who worked as Trump’s business assistant from 1987 to 2021, testified that she once saw Daniels at Trump Tower before he ran for president. She said she heard Trump say he was interested in casting her on “The Apprentice”, the reality TV show he hosted. She added that the email addresses of Daniels and McDougal were stored in the computer systems of Trump’s company.
Trump shook her hand when she left the witness stand.
Under cross-examination, Trump lawyer Emil Bove sought to undermine Pecker’s credibility.
During the cross-examination, Bove sought to ruffle Pecker by noting timeline inconsistencies, while also casting the “catch and kill” tactics described by prosecutors as “business as usual”.
Prosecutors say Pecker’s arrangement with Trump corrupted the 2016 election. He agreed to cooperate to avoid criminal charges.
Trump is the first former president to face criminal charges. The trial, which is expected to run through May, could be the only one of his four criminal prosecutions to be completed before his Nov 5 election rematch with Demo­cratic President Joe Biden.
One of those cases, which charges Trump with trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden, has been delayed for months by the US Supreme Court as it considers Trump’s argument that presidents should be immune for actions they take while in office.
In oral arguments on Thursday, justices on the conservative-majority court signaled support that Trump should have some level of protection from criminal charges.
Justice Juan Merchan, who is hearing the New York hush money case, has yet to rule on a request by prosecutors to punish Trump for allegedly violating a gag order that bars him from publicly criticising witnesses, some court officials and their relatives.
Merchan said he would hold a hearing next Thursday to examine what prosecutors say are further gag order violations.
